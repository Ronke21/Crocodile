<text>The Firelands, or Sufferers&#x27; Lands, tract was located at the western end of the Connecticut Western Reserve in what is now the U.S. state of Ohio. It was legislatively established in 1792, as the &quot;Sufferers&#x27; Lands&quot;, and later became named &quot;Fire Lands&quot; because the resale of the land was intended as financial restitution for residents of the Connecticut towns of Danbury, Fairfield, Greenwich, Groton, New Haven, New London, Norwalk, and Ridgefield. Their homes had been burned in 1779 and 1781 by British forces during the American Revolutionary War. However, most of the settlement of the area did not occur until after the War of 1812. &quot;Fire Lands&quot; was later spelled as one word: &quot;Firelands.&quot;

== History ==
In 1792 the Connecticut legislature set aside 500,000 acres (2,000 km2), at the western end of the &quot;Western Reserve&quot; for the Connecticut &quot;Sufferers&quot;. The area consisted of nearly all of the present-day Huron and Erie counties, as well as Danbury Township (Marblehead Peninsula) and much of Catawba Island Township now in Ottawa County; and Ruggles Township now in Ashland County. [The 1792 legislative decree should not be confused with the actual pioneer settlement of these lands, which began to occur about 1807.]

It is not known if any of the actual &quot;Sufferers&quot; eventually settled in the Firelands. Prior to any settlement here, land speculators had purchased all of the original claims for re-sale. On April 15, 1803, the investor-proprietors formed a corporation to manage the lands to which they were entitled in the newly formed state of Ohio. The land was later divided into 30 five-mile (8 km) square survey townships, which were further subdivided into 120 quarters, each containing . (Note: Although the standard for U.S. survey townships in the Northwest Territory was six miles (approx. 10 km) square at that time, the older standard for survey townships in the Western Reserve was employed.) A drawing was held to determine which land each individual investor share-holder would receive.

Some of the original townships in the Firelands took their names from locations in Connecticut, or from the land-speculators who had purchased them. (In some cases the pioneer settlers took a dislike to these speculators, and so changed their township names.) Later, after the War of 1812, when villages began to be established here, many of these villages were also named for Connecticut villages.

In 1811, Huron County encompassed the entire Firelands (and also included a portion of later Lorain County). Until 1837, all of the Firelands would lie within — and therefore co-exist with — Huron County.

Modern sign-posts erected within this area have the &quot;established 1792&quot; designation date, as mentioned above. The lands were physically surveyed from 1806 to 1808, and very slowly settled after 1808. No villages had developed within the Firelands until about the end of the War of 1812. (The 1806–1808 surveys were not entirely accurate, and exceeded the legislative parameters for the entire &quot;Western Reserve&quot; boundaries; resulting in &#x27;Surplus lands&#x27; directly east of the boundary-line of the Firelands.)

<doc id="742087" wikidata="Q289882" url="?curid=742087" title="Super Monkey Ball (video game)">
<text>is a 2001 platform video game developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega. The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as Monkey Ball, an arcade cabinet running on Sega&#x27;s NAOMI hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the discontinuation of Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast home console and the company&#x27;s subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega&#x27;s first game published for a Nintendo home console.

Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; involves guiding a transparent ball through many levels, the ball containing one of four monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms. The player must reach the goal without falling off or letting the timer reach zero to advance to the next stage. There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.

&quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised the simplicity and subtle depth of its control scheme as well as the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation was lacking. The game was commercially successful and remained one of Sega&#x27;s best-sellers in the United States for much of 2002, eventually spawning a direct sequel, &quot;Super Monkey Ball 2&quot; (2002), and a broader &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; franchise. &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;″s stages were remade as a part of &quot;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&quot; (2021)&quot;.&quot;

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; has three game modes: main game, party games, and mini-games. The mini-games are unavailable at first, and must be unlocked by earning 2,500 &quot;play points&quot; through playing the main game in single-player mode.

=== Main game ===

Reminiscent of &quot;Marble Madness&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, the objective of the main game is to guide one of four playable monkeys (AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon) encased in a transparent ball across a suspended series of platforms and through a goal. By moving the analog stick, the player tilts the entire set of platforms that make up a level, called a &quot;floor&quot;, and the ball rolls accordingly. If the ball falls off a floor (an event dubbed a &quot;fall out&quot;) or the in-game timer reaches zero, the player loses one of their three lives. The speed, in miles per hour, at which the ball is moving is displayed in the corner of the screen. Pausing the game and selecting the &quot;View Stage&quot; option allows one to rotate the camera around and examine the floor. A replay is presented after a floor&#x27;s goal has been reached; replays can be saved to a memory card and viewed at whim. Every second remaining on the timer when a floor is completed adds 100 points to the player&#x27;s score. Collectible bananas found throughout the game are also worth 100 points, while multipliers increasing the player&#x27;s score by a factor of two or four are activated when a floor is finished in under half the allotted time or via a warp gate. The player receives an extra life for every 100 bananas collected.

The main game features three difficulty levels—Beginner, Advanced, and Expert, consisting of 10, 30, and 50 floors each—as well as three modes—Normal, Practice, and Competition. Normal mode allows one to four players to take turns progressing through the arcade &quot;Monkey Ball&quot;, whereas competition mode involves two to four player simultaneous split screen races across a selection of floors. In practice mode, any floor already played in normal mode can be repeated indefinitely with no penalties for failure. In normal mode, the player experiences a game over when they have lost all of their lives, but is allowed five opportunities to continue; eventually, unlimited &quot;continues&quot; can be unlocked. Beginner Extra, Advanced Extra and Expert Extra floors are unlocked when each respective difficulty level is completed without losing a single life (or without using a continue in Expert)—and a hidden set of Master floors can be unlocked through playing the Extra floors without using a continue.

=== Party games ===
The following party games are available:
*Monkey Race: One to four players simultaneously race across six courses divided into three difficulty levels. Steering is handled with the analog stick, while the A button is used to activate items (if enabled) that can be used to produce an increase in speed or to adversely affect opponents. A Time Attack mode involves the careful use of three available speed items to achieve faster times.
*Monkey Fight: One to four players simultaneously engage in combat by rolling in any direction with the analog stick and using the A button to punch opponents with a boxing glove attached to their monkey&#x27;s ball. Points are awarded for knocking opponents off one of the three available arenas, with more points being awarded when the player currently in the lead is knocked off. The player with the most points is declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero. Items can be used to extend the reach, size, and strength of one&#x27;s boxing glove.
*Monkey Target: One to four players take turns rolling their monkey down a ramp, launching it into the sky. The monkey&#x27;s ball opens on command to resemble a pair of wings, allowing it to fly. The monkey&#x27;s trajectory is manipulated with the analog stick. Wind direction and strength, altitude, and speed (in addition to random hazards selected by an optional &quot;Wheel of Danger&quot; feature before each flight) impact the player&#x27;s ability to land the monkey on one of several dartboard-like targets in the middle of the ocean. Bananas collected while airborne enable the use of items in later rounds that can eliminate wind resistance, control the ball&#x27;s roll, multiply the player&#x27;s score, or ensure a sticky landing.

=== Mini-games ===
The mini-games are based on real sporting activities, but with the player&#x27;s ball containing their monkey. The following mini-games are available, once unlocked through the earning of play points:
*Monkey Billiards: One to two players take turns competing in a game of nine-ball. The analog stick determines the direction of each shot and the A button is used to stop the moving gauge that determines shot speed. A tournament mode featuring four AI challengers is also available.
*Monkey Bowling: One to four players take turns competing in a game of ten-pin bowling. The analog stick is used to move left and right, the A button sets the direction and strength for each throw, and the L or R buttons apply spin to the ball. A challenge mode featuring 10 pin arrangements and permitting only 12 throws is also available.
*Monkey Golf: One to four players take turns competing across 18 holes in a game of golf with stroke play scoring, or two players compete using match play scoring. The direction and general rolling distance of each shot is arranged with the analog stick, and the shot&#x27;s strength is set by the A button.

== Development ==

&quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; was developed by Amusement Vision, a branch of the Japanese video game publisher Sega that was created in 2000 and composed of about fifty people. Amusement Vision president Toshihiro Nagoshi, who had previously worked under Sega AM2&#x27;s Yu Suzuki and been credited as the creator of the arcade titles &quot;Daytona USA&quot; and &quot;Virtua Striker&quot;, devised the concept of rolling spheres through mazes based on his desire to create a game that was instantly possible to understand and play, as a contrast to increasingly complex games at Japanese arcades at the time. Prototypes involving a plain ball or a ball with an illustration were considered visually unappealing due to difficulties in perceiving its movement, so after a series of revisions monkey characters previously created by an Amusement Vision designer named Mika Kojima were placed inside the ball, with their appearance being altered to include their &quot;distinctive&quot; ears. Intended to feature a &quot;cute&quot; aesthetic and accurate physics engine, the game debuted at the 2001 Amusement Operator Union trade show as &quot;Monkey Ball&quot;, a single-player arcade cabinet controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped analog stick.

In early 2001, Sega announced that it was discontinuing its Dreamcast home console and restructuring itself into a &quot;platform-agnostic&quot; third-party publisher. As a result, an enhanced version of &quot;Monkey Ball&quot; dubbed &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; was released for the GameCube as a launch game in Japan on September 14, 2001 and North America on November 18. The GameCube version was demonstrated to the public at E3 in May and at Nintendo&#x27;s Space World show in August; Sega confirmed that it would arrive in time for the GameCube&#x27;s launch at the June 2001 World Hobby Fair. As the first game Sega published for a Nintendo home console, &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; was considered a milestone for the company. Although &quot;Monkey Ball&quot; had been developed for Sega&#x27;s NAOMI arcade board, which shared technology with the Dreamcast and was optimized to ensure games could be easily ported between the two platforms, Nagoshi commented that Nintendo&#x27;s young demographic made the GameCube an even more fitting console for the title. According to Nagoshi, Amusement Vision staff felt more comfortable with the GameCube than Sega&#x27;s own hardware and this ease of development contributed to their decision to focus on the system over the PlayStation 2 or Xbox; he also joked that Nintendo was the only hardware manufacturer the staff did not &quot;hate&quot;. Out of a team composed of ten to twenty individuals, it took four Amusement Vision employees between several weeks and two months to port &quot;Monkey Ball&quot; to the GameCube. Its graphics were enhanced with new background details as well as reflections and particle effects. Moreover, the developers spent an additional six months incorporating six extra modes into the game, with an emphasis on multiplayer competition and the introduction of GonGon as a fourth playable character.

The bananas in the game display the Dole Food Company logo, but this was removed in &quot;Super Monkey Ball Deluxe&quot; due to a licensing dispute. A theme song called &quot;Ei Ei Puh!&quot;, which was arranged by Cheru Watanabe and featured vocals by Yu Abiru, was created for the Japanese version of &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; but removed from its U.S. release. Tokyo-based voice actor Brian Matt provided the game&#x27;s narration, albeit uncredited.

== Reception ==
=== Sales ===
&quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; was commercially successful upon release and remained one of Sega&#x27;s best-selling titles in the United States through much of 2002. The game&#x27;s North American sales were strong in 2001, in addition to a further 105,000 units sold through August 2002.

While it sold well in all major territories, Nagoshi was disappointed by the game&#x27;s performance in Japan, where he had expected it would be most successful; weak GameCube launch sales were cited as negatively impacting its performance in the country. The game sold 72,631 units in Japan.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Super Monkey Ball &quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; the highlight of the GameCube&#x27;s launch lineup. &quot;Edge&quot; praised the main game as &quot;absorb[ing]&quot; due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its &quot;reductive control system&quot; and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: &quot;Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It&#x27;s beatable; it&#x27;s an afterthought on the route to your next impossible hurdle.&quot; Ben Turner (&quot;GameSpy&quot;) commented on the &quot;excellent progression of difficulty&quot; engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding &quot;most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game&quot; and &quot;every single level played adds to your skill.&quot; Matt Casamassina (&quot;IGN&quot;) commended the &quot;great level variation&quot;, with &quot;well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience.&quot; Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high &quot;ceiling of mastery&quot; enhanced the game&#x27;s longevity through a &quot;simple but well conceived&quot; scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. &quot;Edge&quot; and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating &quot;there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more.&quot; Tim Knowles (&quot;N-Sider&quot;) pointed out that &quot;the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated&quot;, while Casamassina felt &quot;it may be a little too difficult for the casual gamer.&quot; However, Mark Medina (&quot;N-Sider&quot;) called the learning curve &quot;perfectly spot on&quot;: &quot;Any falling off the platforms feels entirely &quot;your fault&quot; and at the same time, you always get the sense that you&#x27;re just that little bit closer to that elusive goal.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; and Jason Nuyens and Will Stevenson (&quot;N-Sider&quot;) agreed with this sentiment, with the latter two emphasizing the addictive quality of the gameplay. On a technical note, Four-Eyed Dragon (&quot;GamePro&quot;) faulted the camera system, which &quot;can get out of position, making it hard to maneuver in tight spots.&quot; Steven L. Kent (&quot;The Japan Times&quot;) described the game as &quot;a test of nerve&quot; requiring &quot;advanced eye–hand coordination.&quot; Turner reflected on the game&#x27;s ability to evoke feelings of &quot;nervous excitement&quot;, &quot;intensity&quot;, and &quot;electrifying, stomach-wrenching fear&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a thrilling feeling to be winding down a paper-thin path with ten seconds on the clock, hoping against hope that you can keep your balance for just a few more seconds and make it to the goal before time expires.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; opined that the game is &quot;defined&quot; by &quot;unrefined and angular&quot; emotions:

Every second brings another jagged spike of highrise elation or freefall despair, and that&#x27;s what makes the game so superb ... when you finally beat a maze on your 15th try, on the last life of your last continue, it&#x27;s all worth it. If that experience could be distilled into a single word, it would be euphoria; reducing &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; to one word is simpler. It&#x27;s genius.
On the party and mini games, Kent asserted &quot;All of the activities ... were designed with an unerring eye for quality&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot; contended &quot;none are half-assed throwaway rewards&quot;, and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; remarked &quot;each one is a fully realized activity that you could play for hours.&quot; Ricardo Torres (&quot;GameSpot&quot;) called Monkey Race &quot;a solid little racer&quot;, and Casamassina recounted it felt &quot;polished and finely tuned.&quot; Stevenson &quot;loved Monkey Fight&quot;, while Casamassina and Kent highlighted the use of a crown to identify the player currently in the lead as encouraging &quot;players to gang up on each other.&quot; Casamassina hailed Monkey Fight as &quot;a thing of beauty&quot;, but Turner dismissed it as &quot;a dud, as it&#x27;s too much frantic button smacking and not enough skill or thought.&quot; Monkey Target, lauded by Kent as the &quot;most addictive interactive activity of 2001&quot; and considered &quot;the most complex&quot; of the party games by Turner, was complimented by Casamassina for its &quot;simple and brilliantly intuitive&quot; control scheme and &quot;careful science of when to use an item and when to forgo it.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and Medina, respectively, described Monkey Billiards as &quot;a full-blown pool game&quot; and &quot;a very fun alternative to the real game&quot;; Casamassina applauded its &quot;ultra-realistic physics engine that perfectly mimics how pool balls would react ... it all works just as good if not better than any pool simulation available to home consoles.&quot; Casamassina was further impressed by the physics of Monkey Bowling, elaborating that &quot;when the pins break apart one would swear it&#x27;s the real deal&quot;, but Turner criticized its physics as &quot;slightly wonky&quot;. Medina singled out Monkey Bowling&#x27;s &quot;nailbiting&quot; challenge mode as a personal favorite, while &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; considered Monkey Bowling &quot;as good as tenpin gets&quot; and Kent wrote it &quot;is one of the most robust bowling simulations I have ever played.&quot; Finally, Four-Eyed Dragon conveyed that Monkey Golf provided &quot;a humongous challenge&quot; with &quot;crazy, lopsided miniature golf course[s]&quot;, while Kent called it an &quot;absolutely infuriating ... test [of] your aim and your logic.&quot;

Although &quot;not extremely complex or technically impressive in the way that many other launch titles strive to be&quot; Turner believed the graphics were &quot;extremely well-realized and perfectly suited to the game.&quot; According to Torres, &quot;while the four selectable monkey models and the various levels are simple in design, they are generously modeled with well-textured and shaded polygons and have a very rich look.&quot; Four-Eyed Dragon spoke highly of the &quot;hilarious&quot; monkey animations, &quot;sharp reflections and cool water effects&quot;. Likewise, Casamassina enjoyed the dances performed by the monkeys after winning a match and cited the water effects as &quot;particularly incredible&quot;. The game was described by Turner as &quot;colorful&quot; and &quot;crisp&quot; and by Torres as &quot;cartoony&quot; and &quot;clean&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; likened the game&#x27;s aesthetic to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series: &quot;Every surface is bright and solid and shiny, every aspect impeccably presented.&quot; Casamassina, Turner, and Torres all praised the consistent frame rate, with Casamassina emphasizing &quot;it truly, always runs at a full 60 frames per second.&quot; However, Four-Eyed Dragon noted the visuals were &quot;not greatly detailed&quot; and Casamassina observed &quot;there isn&#x27;t much geometry being drawn at any single point in the title and the backgrounds are often barren, whether it be for power or stylistic purposes.&quot; Moreover, Casamassina was disappointed that the three difficulty modes reused level themes and by the absence of progressive scan support. Torres regarded the game&#x27;s sound as &quot;good&quot; but &quot;probably [its] weakest aspect&quot;, calling the music &quot;catchy&quot; but finding the monkey noises repetitive and the remaining sound effects &quot;unspectacular.&quot; Conversely, Blue-Eyed Dragon was favorable to the &quot;boisterously entertaining monkey sounds that can be heard once a chimp hits a wall or falls off a ledge&quot; as well as the &quot;eclectic mix of instrumental tunes&quot;. Turner &quot;thought the music ... set the mood perfectly, but some may find it annoying&quot;.

Kent named &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; &quot;the best party game of all time.&quot; Torres opined that the game &quot;makes a strong case for the power of simple yet incredibly addictive gameplay.&quot; Knowles stated it represented &quot;Sega at its pure best.&quot; &quot;Famitsu&quot; &quot;liked the mini-games in addition to the regular modes.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; hailed the game as &quot;one of the ultimate party games&quot; and &quot;the best in serious gaming, too.&quot; Turner declared it &quot;that rarity of rarities: a perfectly-realized launch title&quot;, with a &quot;bounty of extras&quot; that set &quot;a new standard for arcade to home conversions&quot;. According to Medina, &quot;probably the greatest thing about this game is that it&#x27;s so unassuming, in that you are genuinely very surprised at its extremely high quality.&quot;

&quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best GameCube Game&quot; award, which went to &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The success of the game spawned a franchise, with 16 sequels or spin-offs released to date. Due to its complex physics engine and abundance of possible shortcuts, &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; has been popular with professional speedrunners. A 2006 study conducted by the Beth Israel Medical Center found that surgeons who played the game for 20 minutes prior to performing a surgical drill finished slightly faster and made fewer mistakes. &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; inspired &quot;Neverball&quot;, a free and open source game for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Dreamcast, and iOS. The 2020 battle royale game &quot;Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout&quot; has been described as &quot;&quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; for the &quot;Fortnite&quot; generation&quot; by Tom Wiggins of &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine.

In 2006, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked it the 38th best game available on Nintendo platforms, commenting &quot;who knew that such cute characters with cinnamon roll ears could be the source of so much tension (when the clock is ticking) and so much relief (when they finally break the ribbon)?&quot; In February 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; placed the game 90th on a list of the best Nintendo games, noting that &quot;Along with the bum-clenchingly tricky puzzle stages, you get some great mini-games in this brilliant arcade game.&quot; In March 2009, &quot;Edge&quot; ranked the game #39 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Games To Play Today&quot;, stating &quot;Seeing its sturdy physics model being used to perform incredible acrobatic feats shows just how finely honed it is.&quot; Writing in &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;, Christian Donlan described &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot; as &quot;one of Sega&#x27;s grade-A triumphs.&quot;

<text>John William Draper (May 5, 1811 – January 4, 1882) was an English scientist, philosopher, physician, chemist, historian and photographer. He is credited with pioneering portrait photography (1839–40) and producing the first detailed photograph of the moon in 1840. He was also the first president of the American Chemical Society (1876–77) and a founder of the New York University School of Medicine.

One of Draper&#x27;s books, the &quot;History of the Conflict between Religion and Science&quot;, popularised the conflict thesis proposing intrinsic hostility in the relationship between religion and science. It was widely read and was translated into several languages. 

His son, Henry Draper, and his granddaughter, Antonia Maury, were astronomers. His granddaughter, Carlotta Maury (Antonia&#x27;s younger sister), was a paleontologist. His eldest son, John Christopher Draper, was a chemist; and son Daniel Draper, a meteorologist.

==Early life==
John William Draper was born May 5, 1811, in St. Helens, Lancashire, England, to John Christopher Draper, a Wesleyan clergyman, and Sarah (Ripley) Draper. He also had three sisters, Dorothy Catherine Draper (August 6, 1807 – December 10, 1901), Elizabeth Johnson, and Sarah Ripley. On June 23, he was baptized by the Wesleyan Methodist minister Jabez Bunting. His father often needed to move the family due to serving various congregations throughout England. John Wm. Draper was home tutored until 1822, when he entered Woodhouse Grove School. He returned to home instruction (1826) prior to entering University College London in 1829. While at University College London, Draper studied chemistry under the direction of Edward Turner (chemist).

On September 13, 1831, John William Draper married Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Gardner (–1870), the daughter of Daniel Gardner, a court physician to John VI of Portugal and Charlotte of Spain. Antonia was born in Brazil after the royal family fled Portugal with Napoleon&#x27;s invasion. There is dispute as to the identity of Antonia&#x27;s mother. Around 1830, Antonia was sent with her brother Daniel to live with their aunt in London.

Following his father&#x27;s death in July 1831, John William&#x27;s mother was urged to move with her children to the US state of Virginia. John William hoped to acquire a teaching position at a local Methodist college.

==Virginia==
In 1832, the family settled in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, east of Christiansville (now Chase City). Although he arrived too late to obtain the prospective teaching position, John William established a laboratory in Christiansville. Here he conducted experiments and published eight papers before entering medical school. His sister Dorothy Catherine Draper provided finances through teaching drawing and painting for his medical education. In March 1836, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. That same year, he began teaching at Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia.

==New York==
In 1837, Draper accepted an appointment to be head of chemistry in a proposed medical school at New York University, but sufficient funds were not available to go ahead with the project. In 1839, Draper was elected undergraduate professor of chemistry and botany at the university, and moved with his family to New York City . Once there he helped to found the New York University Medical School, acting as a professor there from 1840 to 1850, president of the school from 1850 to 1873, and as a professor of chemistry until 1881.

==Work==

Draper did important research in photochemistry, made portrait photography possible by his improvements (1839) on Louis Daguerre&#x27;s process, and published Organization of Plants (1844), a textbook on Chemistry (1846), textbook on Natural Philosophy (1847), textbook on Physiology (1866), and Scientific Memoirs (1878) on radiant energy.

In the spring of 1839, Draper, with years of experience in photochemistry, took Talbotype photographs at Hampden Sydney College in Virginia. However, he was dissatisfied with the results and decided to wait for the publication of the daguerreotype process. Once the details of the process arrived in America in late September 1839, Draper, now a professor at New York University, captured landscape photographs. On or around September 23, he took one of the earliest daguerreotype portraits, which depicted his assistant, William Henry Goode.

Throughout 1839 and 1840, Draper focused on solving the challenge of creating daguerreotype portraits. He collaborated with Samuel Morse and in spring 1840 operated a daguerreotype studio, one of the earliest of its kind, in a building on the roof of the New York University. Draper also photographed his sister, Dorothy Catherine Draper, and one of those pictures (see image) became known to the public via the letter which Draper sent to John Herschel in 1840. Several copies were made of this picture in the 19th century, and the photograph attached with Draper&#x27;s letter was also likely a copy made by Draper himself.
In March 1840 Draper became the second person to produce photographs of an astronomical object, the Moon, considered the first astrophotographs. In 1843 he made daguerreotypes of the solar spectrum that revealed new infra-red and ultra violet lines. In 1850 he was making photomicrographs and engaged his son, Henry (then 13 years old), into their production.

Draper developed the proposition in 1842 that only light rays that are absorbed can produce chemical change. It came to be known as the Grotthuss–Draper law when his name was teamed with a prior but apparently unknown promulgator Theodor Grotthuss of the same idea in 1817.

In 1847 he published the observation that all solids glow red at about the same temperature, about 977 °F (798 K), which has come to be known as the Draper point.

On Saturday 30 May the 1860 Oxford evolution debate featured Draper&#x27;s lecture on his paper &quot;On the Intellectual Development of Europe, considered with reference to the views of Mr. Darwin and others, that the progression of organisms is determined by law.&quot; Draper&#x27;s presentation was an early example of applying a Darwinian metaphor of adaptation and environment to social and political studies, but was thought to be long and boring. The hall was crowded to hear Bishop Samuel Wilberforce&#x27;s views on Charles Darwin&#x27;s recent publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, and the occasion was a historically significant part of the reaction to Darwin&#x27;s theory due to reports of Thomas Henry Huxley&#x27;s response to Wilberforce.

Contributions to the discipline of history: Draper is well known also as the author of &quot;The History of the Intellectual Development of Europe&quot; (1862), applying the methods of physical science to history, a &quot;History of the American Civil War&quot; (3 vols., 1867–1870), and a &quot;History of the Conflict between Religion and Science&quot; (1874). The last book listed is among the most influential works on the conflict thesis, which takes its name from Draper&#x27;s title. His book examined the relationship between religion and science, dismissing ideas of harmony and presenting the history of science as &quot;not a mere record of isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on the one side, and the compression arising from traditional faith and human interests on the other.&quot; After outlining the origins of science in ancient Greek philosophy, Draper presented the development of Christianity as leading to repression of science. His argument, aimed at his fellow Protestants, employed anti-Catholic rhetoric, but also said that these &quot;two rival divisions of the Christian church&quot; were &quot;in accord on one point: to tolerate no science except such as they considered agreeable to the Scriptures&quot;, and both were liable to &quot;theological odium&quot;. The book went through fifty printings in the United States alone, and was translated into ten languages. Professor Ronald Numbers has pointed to Draper&#x27;s book as a source of popular misconceptions about historical conflict between science and religion, saying that it was &quot;less of a dispassionate history, which it wasn&#x27;t, than a screed against Roman Catholics&quot; motivated by personal animus at the behavior of his sister, a Catholic nun, regarding the death of his son.

Draper was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1844. He served as the first president of the American Chemical Society in 1876.
He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1877.

<text>Hans Knirsch (14 September 1877 in Třebařov – 6 December 1933 in Duchcov) was an Austro-German activist from Moravia for Austrian Nazism. After the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he led the original party in Bohemia, called the German National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. Together with Rudolf Jung and Hans Krebs, he was one of the original core that remained in the Nazi Party after 1933.

== Biography ==
Hans Knirsch became a &quot;Geschäftsführer&quot;, or managing leader, of the Mährisch-Trübauer Verband in 1901. In that capacity he published an appeal which extolled the political unification of all Germans into one state, referring to it as &quot;der alte Sehnsuchstraum der deutschen Demokraten&quot; (&quot;the old nostalgic dream of the German democrats&quot;).

Active in several party congresses, before World War I he attempted to get the DAP to add the words &quot;National Socialist&quot; to their name. The effort failed, as the proposed name was felt to be too reminiscent of the Czech National Social Party Following his arrest for the failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler went on a hunger strike. It was Hans Knirsch who talked Hitler out of his depression and convinced him to resume eating.

<text>William Henry Draper Jr. (August 10, 1894 – December 26, 1974) was an American army officer, banker, government official, and diplomat.

== Early life ==
William Henry Draper Jr., was born on August 10, 1894, in Harlem, New York City. His parents were Mary Emma (née Carey) Draper (1872–1960) and William Henry Draper (1859–1929).

Draper received a B.A. and M.A. in economics at New York University.

==Career==

Draper joined the U.S. Army soon after finishing college and served during World War I as a major in the infantry. After the war, he stayed in the Army Reserves and worked his way up to chief of staff of the 77th Division from 1936 to 1940.

From 1919 to 1921, he worked for National City Bank in New York City. He later worked for Bankers Trust from 1923 to 1927, and then Dillon, Read &amp; Co. from 1927. In 1937, he was made a vice president of Dillon Read. Dillon Read promoted bonds of the Soviet Union after its recognition by the U.S. government in 1933. Dillon Read also underwrote millions of dollars worth of German industrial bonds in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. He worked for Dillon Read until 1953.

===Public service===
At the invitation of George Marshall, he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve on the President&#x27;s Advisory Committee for Selective Service, and he was promoted to colonel in 1940. At the start of World War II, he took command of the 136th Infantry, 33rd Division, National Guard.

At the end of the war, he was promoted to brigadier-general and was posted to Berlin to serve as chief of the Economics Division, Allied Control Council for Germany from 1945 to 1947. He opposed the Morgenthau Plan, which was designed to prevent a resurgence of German economic and military power by deindustrializing it and turning into a pastoral country. Instead, he strongly supported measures to expedite Germany&#x27;s economic recovery along liberal free-market and democratic lines followed by Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard. There was some criticism of him by the Chief of the Decartelization Branch for Military Government in Germany after World War II, James Stewart Martin for leaving some former Nazis in their positions in industry, in particular Alexander Kreuter.

After a promotion to major-general, Draper was asked by the new Secretary of War Kenneth C. Royall to become his Under Secretary of War. With the transition of the Department of War to the Department of the Army, Draper became the first under secretary of the Army from September 18, 1947, to February 28, 1949. Later in 1949, he rejoined Dillon Read as a senior partner.
According to the Annenberg CPB documentary &quot;The Pacific Century, Ep.5 Reinventing Japan&quot; Gen. Draper, referred to therein as the &quot;Wall Street General&quot; was instrumental in overturning some key progressive reforms sought by Colonel Charles Kades of the Supreme Command Allied Powers (SCAP) in occupied Japan.

Draper served as Long Island Rail Road trustee from 1950 to 1951. He served as the first US Ambassador to NATO in Paris.

===Hiss Case involvement===

On August 7, 1948, Draper, then Undersecretary of War, requested that William L. Marbury Jr. fly to Geneva, Switzerland, and spend a month there to help the U.S. negotiate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Marbury was a close friend of Alger Hiss. Draper&#x27;s request came days after Whittaker Chambers had included Hiss&#x27;s name among those of government spies in the Ware Group during Chambers&#x27; testimony under subpoena before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). In effect, the request prevented Marbury from helping during Hiss&#x27;s further HUAC testimony in August and into September, when Hiss was considering a libel suit against Chambers for statements made August 27 on NBC Radio&#x27;s nationwide &quot;Meet the Press&quot; broadcast.

===Later career===
After retiring from public service a second time, he traveled to Mexico City to serve as chairman of the Mexican Light and Power Company. Returning to the U.S. in 1959, he formed the first West Coast venture capital firm Draper, Gaither and Anderson in California.

In 1967, he retired from Draper Gaither, moved to Washington, D.C., and joined Combustion Engineering in New York as chairman, retiring a few years later to become the U.S. delegate to the United Nations Population Commission, serving from 1969 to 1971. He also cofounded the Population Crisis Committee in 1965 and chaired the Draper Committee.

==Personal life ==
On September 7, 1918, Draper was married to Katherine Louise Baum, a daughter of George Baum of Yonkers, New York. Before her death in 1942, they were the parents of three children, including:

* Dorothy Draper (1920–2017), a graduate of DePauw University who married Lt. James R. Wagner, USNR, who was killed In action in the European theatre of World War II. She joined WAVES and later married Phillips Hawkins in 1947.
* Katherine Louise Draper (1922–2021), also a graduate of DePauw University who married George Dow Haimbaugh Jr. in 1960.
* William Henry Draper III (b. 1928), a venture capitalist who was the founder of Sutter Hill Ventures.

On March 12, 1949, he remarried to Eunice Barzynski, a daughter of Brig.-Gen. Joseph E. Barzynski.

Draper died on December 26, 1974, of a heart attack in Naples, Florida. After a funeral in Fort Myer, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

===Descendants===
Through his son William, he was the grandfather of actress Polly Draper and venture capitalist Timothy C. Draper who founded Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Through his grandson Timothy, he was a great-grandfather of venture capitalist and television personality Jesse Draper. Through his granddaughter Polly, he was a great-grandfather of Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, who are both actors and musicians.

<text>Thelwall is a suburban village in the civil parish of Grappenhall and Thelwall, in the Warrington district, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It is close to the Lymm junction of the M6 motorway.

==History==
A fortified village was established at Thelwall in 923, in the reign of King Edward the Elder, which is mentioned in two very early sources, including the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;:
&quot;Kynge Edwarde made a cite at Thelewall in [th]e northe parte of [th]e Marches, nye the water of Mersee, where he put certeyne knyghtes.&quot;—Higden&#x27;s Polychronicon
&quot;A.D. 923. This year went King Edward with an army, late in the harvest, to Thelwall; and ordered the borough to be repaired, and inhabited, and manned. And he ordered another army also from the population of Mercia, the while he sat there to go to Manchester in Northumbria, to repair and to man it. This year died Archbishop Plegmund; and King Reynold won York.&quot;—&quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;

An inscription on the Pickering Arms records that &quot;In the year 920 King Edward the Elder founded a city here and called it Thelwall&quot;. According to Sir Peter Leycester it was &quot;so called from the stakes and stumps, cut from the trees, wherewith it was environed about as a wall&quot;. It is more likely that the original meaning of Thelwall was &quot;pool by a plank bridge&quot; (the earliest record of the name is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 923 as &quot;Thelwæl&quot;, in 1241 it occurs as &quot;Thelewell&quot;).

Earthworks remain of an embankment, possibly part of these fortifications, found in the grounds of Chaigeley School. These remains are a designated English Heritage National Monument.

Thomas de Thelwall, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 1377–78, was born here in the early fourteenth century.

Thelwall was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Runcorn, in 1866 Thelwall became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished and merged with Grappenhall. In 1931 the parish had a population of 509.

==Geography==
Thelwall nowadays borders the villages of Lymm and Grappenhall, and (across the Manchester Ship Canal) Latchford. It is also one of the two principal settlements of Grappenhall and Thelwall civil parish. According to the 2001 census, the population of the entire civil parish was 9,377.

Thelwall is perhaps best known for the Thelwall Viaduct, which carries the M6 motorway across the Manchester Ship Canal and opened in 1963 (a second viaduct was added in 1996). The village is between the Ship Canal and the Bridgewater Canal, and on the east–west A56 and B5157. To the east, between the village and the M6, is Statham.

<text>Abdullah Shah (1965 – 20 April 2004) was an Afghan serial killer found guilty in Kabul of killing more than 20 people, including his wife. His sanctioned execution was the first in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001.

== Biography ==
Shah served under Zardad Khan—even earning the nickname Zardad&#x27;s dog— who served under Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the civil war in Afghanistan (1992–1996). Shah and Zardad robbed travellers on the road from Kabul to Jalalabad. 

He was first convicted in special court proceedings in October 2002. Nine people testified against him at the trial, including another wife he tried to set on fire. The bodies of many of Shah&#x27;s victims were found in a well in Paghman District.

The execution took place in the Pul-e-Charkhi jail. Interim president Hamid Karzai signed the death warrant. At the execution, Shah was shot in the back of the head. Witnesses present included representatives of the Afghan police, the Attorney General&#x27;s office and doctors.

Amnesty International protested against the execution claiming Afghanistan avoided basic standards of fairness. The organization added that Shah was probably silenced so he could not testify against commanders allied to the government. It said he was not provided with a defence attorney, the trial was secret, a confession was obtained under torture and the first judge in his case was dismissed for taking a bribe. The second judge came under pressure from the Supreme Court to impose the sentence.

<text>Calgary Transit is the public transit agency which is owned and operated by the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. In 2019, an estimated 106.5 million passengers boarded approximately 1,155 Calgary Transit vehicles. It operates light metro (LRT), urban tramway (in the downtown free-fare zone), bus rapid transit (BRT), para-transit, and regular bus services. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==
What would eventually become Calgary Transit began as the Calgary Street Railway on July 5, 1909, with twelve electric streetcars serving what was at the time a city of 30,000.
This streetcar service expanded throughout the next thirty years (including the Depression) until 1946, when the company was renamed to Calgary Transit System as electric trolleybus vehicles began replacing the local streetcars. Eventually the electric trolley lines were phased out together — to be replaced by diesel buses. In 1972, CTS assumed its current name of Calgary Transit.

Between the early 1970s and 2000, Calgary Transit had a three tier bus service. Standard bus routes were identified with white bus stop signs. Blue Arrow bus routes, marked by blue signs, provided limited stops, and all day service to suburban neighbourhoods from the city centre. Express service was indicated with red signs and provided extremely limited bus service to the far reaches of the city during peak hours only. These tiers have been slowly phased out, since Calgary Transit began expanding CTrain lines and capacity and implementing BRT service. The last Blue Arrow route was cancelled in December, 2019. Express routes now appear side by side on the same signs as regular routes. MAX routes appear on a separate white and grey sign, while non-MAX BRT lines (routes 300, 301, 302, and 305) appear on red and white signs.

In 2012, Calgary Transit planners presented mayor Naheed Nenshi&#x27;s council with a tentative 30-year plan &#x27;RouteAhead&#x27; to enhance the capacities of Calgary Transit.

On December 13, 2012, Craig Hardy, became the one hundred millionth rider of the year. He received free transit for a year and was celebrated by mayor Nenshi.

== CTrain light rail system ==

On May 25, 1981, Calgary Transit became one of the first transit systems in North America (behind Edmonton LRT which opened in 1978) to operate a light rail system — the CTrain, on which construction had begun in 1978. The original line (referred to internally as the Red Line, and externally as Route 201) ran from Anderson station (just north of Anderson Road in the south end of the city) to 8th St SW in Downtown Calgary.

On April 27, 1985, a northeastern-bound line (Blue Line/Route 202) was opened, running from 8th St SW to Whitehorn station (just south of the intersection of McKnight Boulevard and 36th Street in the northeastern quadrant of the city), and on September 4, 1987, a northwestern-bound line (C-Line / part of Route 201) was opened in time for the 1988 Winter Olympics, running from downtown to University station (directly east of the University of Calgary campus, between 24th and 32nd Avenue on Crowchild Trail).

On September 3, 1990, a 1 km extension of the northwest line to Brentwood station (south of Brisebois Drive on Crowchild Trail) was opened; on October 9, 2001, two new stations — Canyon Meadows station (north of Canyon Meadows Drive and west of Macleod Trail) and Fish Creek–Lacombe station (south of Bannister Road and west of Macleod Trail) were added to the south line; on December 15, 2003, Dalhousie station (south of 53rd Street in the median of Crowchild Trail) was added to the northwestern line.

On June 28, 2004, two new stations for the south line opened: Shawnessy station (south of a brand new interchange at Macleod Trail and Shawnessy Boulevard) and Somerset–Bridlewood station (south of 162nd Avenue and just north of Shawville Gate).

On December 17, 2007, an extension was made to the Route 202 northeast line (first extension ever on the history of the line) from Whitehorn to the new McKnight–Westwinds station.;

On June 15, 2009, Crowfoot station was added on the northwest line located directly west of Crowfoot Town Centre in the median of Crowchild Trail.

On August 27, 2012, Martindale and Saddletowne stations were added to the northeast line, bringing the total number of stations on this line to 10.

On December 10, 2012, the West LRT opened, with six new stations and Downtown West–Kerby station in downtown. Since it is Calgary&#x27;s newest LRT line in 25 years, it is an extension of Route 202 (Blue Line). After this opening, the CTrain system total length is now long.

Future extensions include the North Central line and the Southeast line (together running as the Green Line) running from north of North Pointe Bus Terminal, down Centre Street, through downtown, into the communities of Ogden, Douglasdale and McKenzie in the southeastern portion of the city, finally ending at the South Health Campus in Seton. Phase one of the North Central Line will travel from Eau Claire downtown to Shepard in the SE. This is seen as the most complex portion of the line, requiring tunneling through downtown as well as a large elevated portion. Construction started in 2018 on works to enable future rail construction.

On July 18, 2007, Calgary Transit officially unveiled a new red and white livery for its CTrain, articulated buses and every new bus or train coming into the system.

On August 27, 2008, a train en route to the Somerset station collided with a construction crane in between the Dalhousie and Brentwood stations. Six were injured in the accident, including one child.

On February 18, 2009, Calgary Transit celebrated the 1,000,000,000th rider, randomly selecting a passenger, Shelly Xiao during a ceremony at the 1 Street SW CTrain station.

== Bus rapid transit and future ==

On August 30, 2004, Calgary Transit opened a bus rapid transit line to operate future CTrain routes (the D-Line and an as-yet unplanned northbound line), using conventional buses until articulated buses entered service on June 25, 2007. The BRT system consisted of a single route, Route 301, serving the northern and western parts of the city. A subsequent route, Route 305, was added in 2008, serving the Bowness and 17th Avenue East corridors. A third route, Route 302, entered service on August 31, 2009, along a proposed southeast LRT corridor.

The BRT is considered to be the successor to the &quot;Blue Arrow&quot; service introduced to the 1970s: both were a series of limited-stop routes that were to be intended to be replaced by LRT service in the future — however, the Blue Arrow service was never a true BRT (limited stop service, stopping at designated blue bus stop signs, was its only distinctive feature), the modern BRT includes priority at traffic signals, enhanced passenger waiting areas and offers a shorter travel time to the downtown with greater capacity articulated buses. The Blue Arrow name all but disappeared in 2000 in order to unify all bus stops under one common scheme, but certain Blue Arrow routes are still in service to this day. In fact, Route 305 replaces a Blue Arrow route (Route 105).

On September 28, 2009, Council approved the Calgary Transportation Plan (CTP), fulfilling Council&#x27;s priorities of &quot;a city that moves.&quot; The CTP identified over 20 corridors that would serve as the city&#x27;s future Primary Transit Network. These corridors laid the foundations of Calgary Transit&#x27;s future BRT network. Preliminary functional studies were undertaken – specifically for 17 Avenue SE (2010) and the Southwest Transitway (2011) – to explore the feasibility of major transit projects for the near future. On January 11, 2011, Council approved the Bus Rapid Transit Network Plan, which outlined 11 BRT projects that the City plans to pursue in the short, medium, and long terms respectively.These plans included the introduction of 9 new BRT routes: the Airport BRT (short-long term), which would connect the Downtown Core with Calgary International Airport; the Southwest Transitway BRT (short-medium term), which would connect the Downtown Core with Mount Royal University (MRU) and Woodbine; the Southwest Crosstown BRT (short-medium term), which would connect Westbrook Station with MRU and Quarry Park; the North Crosstown BRT (medium term), which would connect Saddletowne Station with 16 Avenue N and the University of Calgary; the 17 Avenue SE Transitway BRT (medium-long term), which would connect the Downtown Core, Inglewood, 17 Avenue SE, towards the East City Limits; the 52 Street E BRT (medium term), which would connect Saddletowne and South Health Campus through the Southeast Industrial Area; the Sage Hill BRT (long term), which would connect Brentwood Station with the Sage Hill Transit Hub using the Shaganappi HOV; the 162 Avenue S BRT (long term), which would connect Somerset-Bridlewood Station with Providence; and the Southeast Crosstown BRT (long term), which would connect Somerset-Bridlewood Station with South Health Campus through Marquis of Lorne Trail. The plans also included enhancements of existing routes 301, 302, and 305.

The Airport BRT was actualised on July 27, 2011, with Route 300. This line was introduced after Calgary&#x27;s Mayor promised to make the airport more accessible via public transit. On March 12, 2012, BRT service was cut significantly in Calgary. The 302 now runs with shuttle buses during off peak hours and weekends. The 305 does not run on weekends at all. These are both due to low ridership. The Southwest Crosstown BRT was actualised on December 10, 2012, with the Route 306. This route runs from Westbrook Station to Heritage Station, connecting MRU and Rockyview Hospital.

In December 2012, Council approved the RouteAhead Plan, which outlined the major transit projects the city would pursue for the next 30 years. RouteAhead identified the BRT routes Southwest Transitway, North Crosstown, Southwest Crosstown, 17 Avenue SE, 52 Street E, and Sage Hill (called Shaganappi HOV) as the key priorities for the city.

Plans not included in RouteAhead – like the 162 Avenue S BRT and the conversions of Route 300 and the 17 Avenue SE BRT into a LRT – were identified as projects to be conducted beyond the 30-year RouteAhead timeframe. RouteAhead also foreshadowed the plan of a new BRT route: the North Regional Context Study/144 Avenue N BRT (long term), which would connect Tuscany Station with the planned Stoney Station (Blue Line northeast extension), passing through communities north of 144 Avenue North and CrossIron Mills.

On November 19, 2018, Calgary&#x27;s BRT network received an overhaul, and saw the introduction of three new lines. The new lines were incorporated under the MAX branding: MAX Orange (Route 303), connecting Brentwood Station with Saddletowne Station, passing through 16th Avenue N; MAX Teal (Route 306), connecting Westbrook Station with the Douglas Glen Transit Hub, passing through MRU, Rockyview Hospital, Heritage Station, and Deerfoot Meadows; and MAX Purple (Route 307), connecting the Downtown Core with East Hills, along a dedicated transitway along International Avenue (Deerfoot Trail to 52 Street SE). The former route 306 was reincorporated under MAX, and busses are now labelled as &quot;MAX Teal.&quot; In order to make the new service unique from existing &quot;BRT&quot; routes, new stops now have heated shelters, real-time information, elevated sidewalks, and security cameras (for MAX Purple). MAX Purple is the first service in Calgary to run on a dedicated transitway. In November 2019, the Southwest MAX line, renamed MAX Yellow, opened to the public. It is the second bus service in Calgary to operate in a dedicated transitway. This route runs from the Downtown Core to Woodbine, passing through MRU and 14 Street SW. As the Currie Barracks area of Calgary develops, the route will eventually be re-routed to serve that area. When a bus equipped with a Luminator Spectrum colour display operates a MAX route, the corresponding colour is displayed alongside the route name.

On September 4, 2023, Calgary Transit eliminated route 305.

== Bus routes ==
== Current service and fleet ==

Calgary Transit operates 147 regular scheduled bus routes as well as over 150 school express or special routes using over 1,000 vehicles, all of which are low floor and wheelchair accessible, and most of which have bicycle racks. Vehicle models used include the 40-foot (12 m) New Flyer D40LF, D40LFR, XD40, XN40, as well as the Nova Bus LFS diesel and LFS CNG. The 60-foot (18 m) articulated bus fleet is composed of the New Flyer D60LFR and XD60. Community Shuttle, which provides scheduled local service with smaller buses, is currently made up of ARBOC Freedom vehicles.

The light rail vehicle (LRV) fleet includes the system&#x27;s original Siemens–Duewag U2 cars, 110 Siemens SD-160s, and 69 Siemens S200s. Calgary Transit&#x27;s 72 original style SD160s were delivered in three orders between 2000 and 2007 and have all since been retrofitted with Air Conditioning and the newer red and white livery. In June 2010, 38 new restyled Siemens SD160s, featuring factory equipped AC and various cosmetic and technical changes over the previous series, began to arrive. In January 2016, the first of 63 Siemens S200 cars began arriving which entered service in July 2016.

The CTrain system along with several mainline bus routes provide the backbone of the system while many feeder bus routes and express services act to complement this backbone service. Service frequency on the CTrain and busier bus routes is typically from 5–30 minutes with operating hours of about 5 am – 2 am. Most feeder bus routes run at 15–45 minute intervals with similar operating hours on most routes and reduced on others. In addition there are many rush hour only services, some are feeder routes and some are express routes, these usually run 10–30 minutes apart.

== Fares ==
Calgary Transit currently operates as a single fare zone, with a flat rate fare for all standard service including bus, BRT, and the CTrain. As of January 2024, a single adult fare is $3.70, or $2.50 for youth. Children under 12 can ride for free. Books of 10 tickets are available at par to 10 fares. Monthly passes are also available, with youth passes for $82.00, and adult passes for $115.00. Seniors (65 and over) pay $154.50 for a yearly pass which is valid from July 1 to June 30 of the following year and which entitles them to travel at any time. Occasionally sponsors allow for free travel across the network for one day, such as New Year&#x27;s Eve 2023 which was funded by Toronto-Dominion Bank. TD also sponsors the Free Fare Zone, where travel between all CTrain stations along 7th avenue downtown is free. In order to transfer from one transit vehicle to another, proof of fare from the CTrain, or a transfer from a bus is required. A transfer or proof of fare is valid for 90 minutes from the time of issue, for any transit service (including stopovers). Fare inspections take place on the CTrain.

In cooperation with many of the post-secondary schools located in the city, a Universal Pass (U-Pass) program is offered to all students, paid as part of their tuition.

Detailed Fare Table:
== Connect Card ==
The &quot;Connect Card&quot; is the name of Calgary Transit&#x27;s proposed electronic fare smart-card. After two years of work and after installing smart-card readers on every bus and at all CTrain stations that were supposed to start working in the summer of 2012, Calgary Transit cancelled the deal with its contractor, Spain-headquartered Telvent. The City of Calgary announced on November 8, 2012, that crews will remove the new smart-card machines out of all Calgary Transit 1,000 city buses and 160 LRT pay machines after repeated glitches and delays.
About one year later, the City then announced that they would relaunch the initiative, again with Telvent as the provider. In June 2015, the City of Calgary decided to scrap the Connect Card project and attempt to recover costs from Schneider Electric (formerly Telvent).

Following the failure to implement CC, Calgary Transit reported in November 2016 that they were in contact with their counterparts in Vancouver, Edmonton, Salt Lake City and Philadelphia to study how the cities implemented their transit smart card systems.

== MyFare App ==
In summer 2020, after a year-long trial, Calgary Transit rolled out its MyFare app for mobile devices, based on Masabi&#x27;s &quot;Justride&quot; platform. The app, downloadable from normal app stores, allows users to purchase most types of fare media, either via an online account or as guests. Payment is charged to a debit or credit card.

Once activated, the fare media is valid for the period specified in the attached terms and conditions. Users call up the media, then scan the device against a reader on buses; CTrain fare inspectors have portable readers. Many citizens resent the fact that single-ride tickets, if not activated, expire 7 days after purchase date.

== Facilities ==
There are six major Calgary Transit facilities to store and maintain the transit fleet, as well as run several operations departments to keep the system running:

* Spring Gardens Administrative Building/Garage: Conventional and shuttle bus storage, administration, machine shop, body shop, heavy duty diesel mechanical shop, bus operator training, maintenance and equipment training
* Victoria Park Garage: Articulated and Conventional bus storage, body shop, call centre, heavy duty mechanical shop, bus and rail operations control centre, protective services
* Anderson Garage: Conventional bus storage, LRV storage, LRV light/heavy duty maintenance, bus/LRV body shop, machine shop, heavy duty diesel mechanical shop, LRV operator training, maintenance and equipment training
* Haysboro LRV Storage Site: LRV storage
* Oliver Bowen Maintenance Facility: LRV storage, LRV light/heavy duty maintenance, machine shop
* Stoney Garage: Conventional CNG bus storage and CNG fueling station.

== Public Safety and Enforcement ==


The Calgary Transit Public Safety and Enforcement Section (formerly the Calgary Transit Protective Services) is the enforcement agency for Calgary Transit. Formed in 1981, as special constables under the &quot;Police Act of Alberta&quot;, special constables had most authorities given to regular police constables. In 2008, the new &quot;Peace Officer Act&quot; replaced the old police act. Officers were then renamed as &quot;peace officers&quot; under this act and given full peace officer powers in the province of Alberta.

=== Mandate ===
The main duties of a Calgary Transit peace officer are to protect the public using the system, its employees and its assets. Officers must respond to requests for assistance from customers and employees which include arresting persons found committing criminal offences (indictable or summary conviction) on or in relation to Calgary Transit facilities, vehicles and property.

Other duties includes public education, regular patrols of the transit system, customer relations and issuance of violation tickets.

=== Officers ===
PS&amp;E peace officers have similar powers of a police officer to enforce federal statutes and various provincial statutes while in the execution of their specifically appointed duties, as they pertain to Calgary Transit property. Officers enforce the &quot;Criminal Code of Canada&quot; (CCC), the &quot;Gaming and Liquor Act of Alberta&quot;, the &quot;Traffic Safety Act of Alberta&quot; (TSA) – non-moving violations, the &quot;Provincial Offences and Procedures Act&quot; (POPA), &quot;Trespass to Premise Act&quot; (TPA), the &quot;Petty Trespass Act of Alberta&quot; and all municipal by-laws for the City of Calgary.

PS&amp;E officers have a Memorandum of Understanding or (MoU) with the Calgary Police Service that gives transit peace officers extended authority to arrest and detain individuals with outstanding warrants and execute these warrants. This extended authority also allows for transport of arrested individuals to the Calgary Court Services Section (CSS) or Calgary Remand Center (CRC).

Currently, the force deploys 140 officers with full peace officers status. All officers are equipped with handcuffs, OC spray, collapsible batons and protective body armour.

In June 2009, a new mountain bike unit of eight officers was created and deployed. Officers went through an intensive week-long training program through the internationally recognized Law Enforcement Bike Association (LEBA).

PS&amp;E partners with the local municipal police force:Calgary Police Service, in enforcing laws in the Calgary area on transit properties. As with most agencies, PS&amp;E utilizes its own radio service; and a centralized call taking and dispatch centre.

== Commuter Rail ==
Calgary Transit briefly experimented with a commuter train in 1996. The service consisted of a single line, running from a platform at 162 Avenue SW (present-day Somerset–Bridlewood station) to Anderson station (then the terminus of the South Line), where commuters could transfer to the CTrain network. Running every 20 minutes during the morning and evening rush hours, the free service carried an average of just over 800 people per day. The city did not lay any new track, but ran the trains on the CPR freight line running alongside the South Line&#x27;s tracks. Siemens RegioSprinter diesel multiple units were used as the rolling stock. With a top speed of 120 kilometres per hour, the train could cover the roughly 7 kilometres in a matter of minutes. The city ultimately decided not to implement permanent commuter rail. The CTrain system was later extended along the same corridor, with more stations and regular service.

In recent years, transit planners and some politicians have discussed adding commuter service to Airdrie (currently served by express bus routes by Airdrie Transit), Cochrane, Okotoks (none, Okotoks Transit is a local on-demand service), Strathmore (none, only on-demand mobility van service by Handi-Bus) and other nearby cities and towns, but no firm plans have been made.

<text>Leivonmäki is a former municipality of Finland in the Central Finland region. The municipality was consolidated with Joutsa in 2008. The population of Leivonmäki was 1,135 in 2007.

It is located south-east from Jyväskylä. It is known for its marshy grounds and its national park.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.

== Geography ==
Bogs and other wetlands make up roughly or 48% of the former municipality&#x27;s area, the average in Central Finland being 25%. The largest wetlands are Kivisuo, Haapasuo, Havusuo, Rokasuo and Höystösensuo. Leivonmäki has fewer lakes than the Central Finnish average as it is located on a drainage divide area within the Kymijoki basin. The largest lake is Rutajärvi, which discharges into the Päijänne.
=== Villages ===
The following villages have or have had their own school district:

* Etu-Ikola
* Havumäki
* Kirkonkylä
* Kivisuo
* Rutalahti
* Savenaho
* Taka-Ikola
* Tikanmäki
* Vartiamäki

A part of the municipality also belonged to the Vallaspelto school district, the village of Vallaspelto itself being part of Joutsa. Kurkijärvi also had its own short-lived school between 1933–1937.

== Naming and etymology ==
The name of Leivonmäki was first attested in 1564 as &quot;Leijuomäki&quot;. is Finnish for &quot;hill&quot; and the parish church is located by a hill called &quot;Kuhasenmäki&quot;, which therefore may have originally been called &quot;Leivonmäki&quot; or &quot;Leivomäki&quot;. According to Väinö Voionmaa, Leivonmäki may also have been named after the &quot;Leivonen&quot; farm in the village of Anajala in Sääksmäki.

The initial element is most likely the word &quot;skylark&quot;, though linguist Terho Itkonen also considered the possibility of the dialectal variant &quot;Levonmäki&quot; being the original form of the name. According to this explanation, the initial element would be (genitive: ) meaning &quot;rest&quot;, referring to a resting place for cattle. However, the name is written with an &quot;i&quot; in most documents from the Swedish era, and the name was in use before the area was settled permanently – before cattle could have been kept in the area. The form &quot;Levonmäki&quot; may also be due to the Savonian pronunciation of as &quot;leevo&quot;.

==Twinnings==
Leivonmäki was twinned with the Estonian Haaslava Parish.

<text>Himmelbjerget (&quot;The Sky Mountain&quot; or &quot;The Mountain of Heaven&quot;) is a hill located between Ry and Silkeborg, Denmark in the area known as Søhøjlandet.

With an elevation of 147 m (482 ft), Himmelbjerget is one of the highest natural points in the Danish landscape. The hill and surrounding area has been a centre for various gatherings and celebrations for more than 200 years and in 1875, a red brick tower was erected at the top.

== Height and prominence ==
Himmelbjerget was believed to be the highest natural point in Denmark until 1847, when Ejer Bavnehøj was measured as the highest point. Following a scientific survey in 2005, Møllehøj was established as the highest natural point, at 170.86 m. Himmelbjerget is now ranked eighth-highest hill behind Møllehøj, Yding Skovhøj, Ejer Bavnehøj and more. However, when it comes to the size of the slope, Himmelbjerget is much more impressive than the other three: there is a height difference of 121 m from the lake below to the top of the hill, which is remarkable by Danish standards. An amusing detail is the sign &quot;to the boat&quot; at the peak.

==Historic importance==
Himmelbjerget grew to fame in Denmark during the 19th century, as people gathered here to admire the magnificent views and celebrate the birth of the Danish nation. On top of the hill is a 25.1 m tall tower, that was erected in 1875 to honour King Frederik VII and his role in giving the Danish people the country&#x27;s first constitution in 1849, thereby ending the preceding era of absolute monarchy. Close to the top are more monuments, most honouring individuals, but also one to commemorate women&#x27;s right to vote in 1915.

In those days, several steamboats began ferrying visitors back and forth to Himmelbjerget, from various destinations across Julsø and The Silkeborg Lakes. This tradition is still alive and the historic steamship &quot;Hjejlen&quot; (&quot;The Golden Plover&quot;), carries passengers here from the towns of Ry and Silkeborg.

==Hiking==
There are several hiking routes in the larger area of Søhøjlandet and the major route of Hiking Route Aarhus-Silkeborg, is passing through the area of Himmelbjerget. There are also plenty of opportunity to small scale hiking experiences on and around the hill itself.

<doc id="742165" wikidata="Q1071896" url="?curid=742165" title="Tommy Lasorda">
<text>Thomas Charles Lasorda (September 22, 1927 – January 7, 2021) was an American professional baseball pitcher and manager. He managed the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1976 through 1996. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 1997.

Lasorda played in MLB for the Dodgers in 1954 and 1955 and for the Kansas City Athletics in 1956. He coached for the Dodgers from 1973 through 1976 before taking over as manager. Lasorda won two World Series championships as manager of the Dodgers and was named the Manager of the Year of the National League (NL) twice. His uniform number 2 was retired by the Dodgers.

==Early life==
Thomas Charles Lasorda was born on September 22, 1927, in Norristown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Norristown High School in 1944, where he excelled in baseball.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Lasorda signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1945 and began his professional career that season with the Concord Weavers of the Class D North Carolina State League. He missed the 1946 and 1947 seasons because of a stint in the United States Army. He served on active duty from October 1945 until spring 1947. Lasorda returned to baseball in 1948 with the Schenectady Blue Jays of the Canadian–American League. On May 31, 1948, he struck out 25 Amsterdam Rugmakers in a 15-inning game, setting a professional record, and drove in the winning run with a single. He played with Schenectady from 1948 through 1950.

Lasorda then played for Almendares of the Cuban League in Havana, Cuba in 1950–52 and again in 1958–60, compiling a 16–13 record in four seasons, including 8–3 with a 1.89 ERA in 1958–59. Lasorda also pitched for Marianao, a league rival of Almendares also in the Havana area.
The Brooklyn Dodgers drafted Lasorda from the Phillies organization in 1949. The Dodgers sent him to the Greenville Spinners in 1949, and to the Montreal Royals of the International League in 1950. He pitched for Montreal in 1950 through 1954.

===Brooklyn Dodgers (1954–1955)===
Lasorda made his Major League debut on August 5, 1954, for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He made his only start for the Dodgers on May 5, 1955, but was removed after the first inning after tying a major-league record with three wild pitches in one inning and being spiked by Wally Moon of the St. Louis Cardinals when Moon scored on the third wild pitch. Lasorda made only three more appearances for the Dodgers, was optioned back to Montreal on June 8, and was replaced on the major league roster by Sandy Koufax.

===Kansas City Athletics (1956)===

Before the 1956 season, Lasorda was sold to the Kansas City Athletics, Kansas City traded him to the New York Yankees for Wally Burnette in July 1956. He appeared in 22 games for the Yankees&#x27; affiliate Triple-A Denver Bears in 1956–1957, and then was sold back to the Dodgers in 1957. During his tenure with the Bears, Lasorda was profoundly influenced by Denver manager Ralph Houk, who became Lasorda&#x27;s role model for a major league manager.

&quot;Ralph taught me that if you treat players like human beings, they will play like Superman,&quot; he told Bill Plaschke in the biography &quot;I Live for This: Baseball&#x27;s Last True Believer&quot;. &quot;He taught me how a pat on a shoulder can be just as important as a kick in the butt.&quot;

Lasorda returned to Montreal for the 1958 through 1960 seasons, but was released in July 1960. He was the winningest pitcher in the history of the team (107–57). On June 24, 2006, he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. He ended his major league career with a 0–4 record and a 6.52 ERA in 26 games.

==Coaching career==
===Minor leagues===
Al Campanis, the Dodgers&#x27; scouting director, hired Lasorda as a scout in 1960. In 1966, he became the manager of the Pocatello Chiefs in the rookie leagues, then managed the Ogden Dodgers from 1966 to 1968. To inspire confidence in his players at Ogden, he would have each of them write a letter to the LA Dodger that played their position everyday in the big leagues, informing the regular that they would be replacing him one day. He became the Dodgers&#x27; AAA Pacific Coast League manager in 1969 with the Spokane Indians. He remained manager of the AAA team when it became the Albuquerque Dukes in 1972. His 1972 Dukes team won the PCL Championship. 

Lasorda also managed in the Latin American winter leagues. He led the Dominican Republic team Tigres del Licey to back-to-back LIDOM titles, as well as a Caribbean Series title at the 1973 edition in Venezuela.

===Dodgers&#x27; third-base coach===
In 1973, Lasorda became the third-base coach on the staff of Hall of Fame manager Walter Alston, serving four seasons. He was widely regarded as Alston&#x27;s heir apparent and turned down several major league managing jobs elsewhere to remain in the Dodger fold. He later returned to the third-base coach&#x27;s box on a temporary basis while managing the Dodgers.

==Managerial career==
===Los Angeles Dodgers (1976–1996)===

Lasorda became the Los Angeles Dodgers manager September 29, 1976, upon Alston&#x27;s retirement. When asked by broadcaster Vin Scully if he felt any pressure replacing Alston, Lasorda responded, &quot;No, Vin, I&#x27;m worried about the guy who&#x27;s gonna replace me. That&#x27;s the guy who&#x27;s gonna have it tough.&quot; He managed the final four games of the 1976 season. Lasorda oversaw the remainder of the historic Dodger infield, which started on a regular basis from 1973 to 1981.

The 1981 Major League Baseball season saw a unique split-season setup in which the leaders of each division at the time of the strike (which lasted from June to July) guaranteed them a playoff spot. The Dodgers, as champions of the first half (by less than a game over Cincinnati), would be matched up against whoever led the NL West after the season re-started. The Dodgers were matched against the Houston Astros, who narrowly beat out the Reds to win the West and play in a National League Division Series. The Astros took the first two games on walk off plays where the Dodgers scored one total run combined. But with three games remaining all in Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles would turn the tables and dominate in pitching (holding Houston to two runs combined) to win three straight and reach the NLCS. In the best-of-five 1981 National League Championship Series, the Dodgers would split the two games in Los Angeles before having to go to Montreal for the next three. They decisively won in Game 4 to stave off elimination before Rick Monday hit a go-ahead home run in the ninth inning to deliver a 2-1 victory in Game 5 to win the series.

A fiery motivator, Lasorda was known for firing up his players when the moment could come up, such as his tirade prior to Game 4 of the 1988 World Series when NBC broadcaster Bob Costas praised the Dodger pitching but criticized the batting as one of the worst seen, with Lasorda exclaiming to the clubhouse, &quot;You hear what Costas said? He said you’re the worst offensive team ever!” The Dodgers, labeled as underdogs against the defending world champion Oakland Athletics, proceeded to win the Series in five games. 

Lasorda managed nine players who won the NL Rookie of the Year Award. The winners came in two strings of consecutive players. From 1979 to 1982, he managed Rick Sutcliffe, Steve Howe, Fernando Valenzuela, and Steve Sax. From 1992 to 1995, he managed Eric Karros, Mike Piazza, Raúl Mondesí, and Hideo Nomo. Before retiring during the 1996 season, he had also managed that year&#x27;s eventual winner, Todd Hollandsworth. Lasorda&#x27;s final game was a 4–3 victory over the Houston Astros, at Dodger Stadium, on June 23, 1996. The following day, he drove himself to the hospital complaining of abdominal pain, and in fact was having a heart attack. Former shortstop Bill Russell would take the reins of the team on an interim basis. He received a clean bill of health from his doctor, but he took into account seeing Don Drysdale die in a hotel room a few years prior with a similar ailment, stating &quot;I got to thinking about my little 9-month-old granddaughter, and how I&#x27;d like to be around when she goes to school.&quot; On July 29, Lasorda formally announced his retirement, thus making Russell only the third man to manage the Dodgers in 43 years. 

Lasorda compiled a 1,599–1,439 record as Dodgers manager, won two World Series championships (1981 and 1988), four National League pennants, and eight division titles in his 20-year career as the Dodgers manager. His 16 wins in 30 NLCS games were the most of any manager at the time of his retirement. He also managed in four All-Star games. His 1,599 career wins rank 22nd all-time, and only two other managers have as many wins with one team: Alston and Mike Scioscia, with the latter playing under Lasorda.

At the time of his retirement, one was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s tough playing for Tommy. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re playing for two different things. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re playing for the Dodgers and you&#x27;re playing for Tommy, too. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but it&#x27;s just a different atmosphere.&quot;

===After managing the Dodgers===
Lasorda was named vice president of the Dodgers upon his retirement from managing in 1996. On June 22, 1998, he became interim general manager upon the firing of Fred Claire. After the season, he helped find a permanent replacement for Claire and was made senior vice president of the Dodgers.
Lasorda came out of retirement to manage the U.S. national team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. He led the Americans to the gold medal, beating favored Cuba, which had won the gold medal at the prior two Olympics. In doing so, he became the first manager to win a World Series championship and lead a team to Olympic gold. Lasorda coached the 2001 All-Star Game as third base coach. While at the plate, Vladimir Guerrero broke his bat while swinging and it flew towards Lasorda, causing him to fall backwards. Lasorda was unharmed.

Following the sale of the Dodgers to Frank McCourt in 2004, Lasorda was appointed special advisor to the chairman, where his responsibilities included scouting, evaluating, and teaching minor league players, acting as an advisor and ambassador for the Dodgers&#x27; international affiliations, and representing the Dodgers in public appearances and speaking engagements.

During spring training in 2008, the Dodgers were invited to play a series of exhibition games in Taiwan. Dodgers manager Joe Torre took a group of players with him for that series. The majority of the team remained behind in Florida to finish out the Grapefruit League season. Lasorda briefly came out of retirement to manage the team that remained in Florida.

In 2011, an unnamed Dodger executive came up with the idea of having Dodger manager Don Mattingly ask Lasorda to be an honorary coach on his 84th birthday, against the San Francisco Giants.

==Public persona ==
Lasorda was famous for his colorful personality and outspoken opinions regarding players and other personnel associated with baseball. He had a number of obscenity-filled tirades, some of which were taped and became underground classics, like his explosion over Kurt Bevacqua in 1982. The most famous of these is his &quot;Dave Kingman tirade&quot; in 1978, in which Lasorda ranted at reporter Paul Olden, who asked him about Kingman hitting three home runs against the Dodgers that day.

He was also known for being fiercely loyal to his players. He explained in an essay he wrote for Tim McCarver’s compilation volume &quot;Diamond Gems&quot; that he wanted to break a mold by ending a longstanding unspoken taboo against managers socializing with their players off the field. He felt it made players even more loyal to him if they saw him as a friend as well. He also said that he made it his business to know the names of all of his players’ wives and children and to ask about them regularly, another characteristic that endeared him to his players for many years.
In 1996, Lasorda voiced the role of Lucky Lasorta, a Black and White Havanese commentating the baseball game in the film &quot;Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco&quot;. He made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Ladybugs&quot; (1992) alongside comedian Rodney Dangerfield. Lasorda portrayed the Dugout Wizard in the syndicated children&#x27;s television show &quot;The Baseball Bunch&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN/SI&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His other television credits playing himself include &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Police Squad!&quot;, &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and &quot;American Restoration&quot;.

Lasorda partially owned the food company Lasorda Foods, which was known primarily for pasta sauces that Lasorda stated were based on a family recipe passed down to his wife, Jo. In September 1989, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Denver firm Discovery Capital Corp. Lasorda continued to own 10% of the restructured entity. The parent company through which Lasorda maintained his stake, Lasorda Foods Holding Corp Inc., was initially based in Fountain Valley, California, before moving to Irvine and then Paramount. A Boca Raton, Florida-based company, Modami Services, acquired Lasorda Foods Holding Corp Inc. in August 1993. Lasorda and Lasorda Foods President Steven Fox, who together owned a majority of Lasorda Foods stock, were paid in Modami shares.

Lasorda developed a reputation for conflict with opposing teams&#x27; mascots. On August 28, 1988 the Phillie Phanatic, the mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies, was riding an ATV, carrying a stuffed likeness of Tommy Lasorda. Lasorda chased the Phanatic around the field, pushing him to the ground before taking the stuffed likeness away and striking the Phanatic with the mannequin several times. Approximately one year later, on August 23 1989, the Montreal Expos&#x27; mascot, Youppi, was taunting Lasorda and performing stunts on top of the Dodger&#x27;s dugout that annoyed Lasorda so deeply he asked third base umpire Bob Davidson to eject Youppi from the game. This marked the first time in MLB history that a mascot was ejected from a game. In an interview, Lasorda also admitted to having confronted the San Diego Chicken, the unofficial mascot of the San Diego Padres, and threatened to choke him if he did not stop his in-game stunts.

In June 2005, President George W. Bush asked Lasorda to serve as a delegate to the U.S. National Day at the World Exposition in Aichi, Japan. In 2008, the government of Japan conferred upon Lasorda the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette, which represents the fourth-highest of eight classes associated with the award. The decoration was presented in acknowledgment of his contributions to Japanese baseball.

Prior to his death, Lasorda was the oldest living Hall of Famer, attaining that distinction after the death of Red Schoendienst on June 6, 2018.

==Personal life and death==
Lasorda was born and raised with four brothers. His father Sabatino was an Italian immigrant from the Tollo region of Abruzzo in Italy. His mother was Carmella (Cavuto) Lasorda. He was the second of five sons. A practicing Roman Catholic, he and his wife Jo, a Baptist, were married in 1950. Lasorda had a priest come to Dodgers games on Sundays to offer Mass for Catholic players. The couple met in Jo&#x27;s hometown of Greenville, South Carolina while Lasorda was playing there for the Greenville Spinners. They resided in Fullerton, California, for more than 50 years and had two children. A gymnasium and youth center in Yorba Linda, California were named in memory of their son Tom Jr. on September 7, 1997. In 1991, Tom Jr. (known as &quot;Spunky&quot;) died of complications related to AIDS. Lasorda denied that his son was gay; according to sportswriter Bill Plaschke, he insisted his son died of cancer.

Lasorda was the godfather to Thomas Piazza, the younger brother of Major League Hall of Fame catcher Mike Piazza, both of whom are also from Lasorda&#x27;s
hometown of Norristown, Pennsylvania. Thomas was named after Lasorda and it has been widely misstated by Steve Staats that Lasorda is Mike&#x27;s godfather. Lasorda was also the godfather to Alex Avila, a catcher with the Washington Nationals. Alex&#x27;s grandfather, Ralph Avila, is a former scout with the Dodgers and friend to Lasorda of over 50 years. Alex&#x27;s middle name of Thomas was given for Lasorda. Lasorda was also the godfather of Kyle Karros, Eric Karros’s son, who currently plays third base in the Colorado Rockies organization. 

On June 3, 2012, at age 84, Lasorda was hospitalized in New York City after suffering a heart attack which was not considered very serious. On November 8, 2020, Lasorda was hospitalized for heart problems and reported to be &quot;in serious condition&quot; in intensive care. The Dodgers did not make the announcement public about his hospitalization until a week later. On December 1, 2020, Lasorda was moved out of intensive care as his condition improved. After being released from the hospital, he went into sudden cardiac arrest at his home two days later on January 7, 2021. He was rushed back to the hospital, where he died that night at the age of 93. Numerous buildings in Los Angeles were illuminated in blue in tribute to Lasorda, including City Hall, Staples Center, and Banc of California Stadium; at Dodger Stadium, flags were flown at half-staff. He was buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park alongside his son, Tom Jr.

On September 21, 2021, the Dodgers announced on Twitter the death of Lasorda&#x27;s widow, Jo, at age 91.

In March 2023, a stretch of the Interstate 5 was named in his honor as &quot;Tommy Lasorda Dodger Legend Memorial Highway,&quot; located in his former residence of Fullerton between Lincoln Avenue and Ball Road.

<text>Jean Margaret Hodgkinson (11 October 1926 – 14 October 2016), known by the stage name Jean Alexander, was a British actress. She was best known to television viewers for her long running role of Hilda Ogden in the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a role she played from 1964 until 1987, and also as Auntie Wainwright in the long-running sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; from 1988 to 2010. For her role in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, she won the 1985 Royal Television Society Award for Best Performance, and received a 1988 BAFTA TV Award nomination for Best Actress.

==Early life==
Jean Margaret Hodgkinson was born at 18 Rhiwlas Street in the Toxteth area of Liverpool, Lancashire on 11 October 1926, to Nell and Archie Hodgkinson; her father worked as an electrician and the family lived in a terraced house with no indoor lavatory. Alexander had an elder brother, Kenneth. She aspired to become an actress from an early age, and later said that she was inspired by variety acts she saw at the Pavilion theatre in her home city. She attended St Edmund&#x27;s College for Girls in Princes Park, Toxteth and as a teenager, she joined an amateur theatre group and took elocution lessons.

==Career==
Alexander spent five years as a library assistant in Liverpool before she began her acting career in 1949 at the Adelphi Guild Theatre in Macclesfield. She first appeared as Florrie in &quot;Sheppey&quot; by Somerset Maugham. She later worked in rep in Oldham, Stockport and York. Most of her parts were minor, and she also worked as a wardrobe mistress and stage manager. Her television debut is variously given as in the police series &quot;Z-Cars&quot; (1962) or in &quot;Deadline Midnight&quot; (1961).

===&quot;Coronation Street&quot;===
Alexander first appeared in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1962 in a minor role as a landlady. Two years later, she returned to the programme as Hilda Ogden. She started playing the role on 8 July 1964, and left the show on 25 December 1987. Ogden became highly popular with viewers and Alexander was often identified with her character. In the &quot;40 Years on Coronation Street&quot; special, she recounted an incident that had happened years previously: while she was shopping, a fan asked if she was Hilda. She responded in her normal accent, &quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; Taken aback, the fan said, &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t you talk funny!&quot;

The British League for Hilda Ogden was established in 1979 by Sir John Betjeman, Willis Hall, Russell Harty, Laurence Olivier and Michael Parkinson, among others. In 1984, hundreds of fans sent her condolence cards after the death of her on-screen husband Stan Ogden; the actor who played him, Bernard Youens, died a few months before his character was killed off. In 1985 she received the Royal Television Society Award for her performance on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. When she decided to leave the show in 1987, fans started &quot;Save Hilda!&quot; campaigns; however, many were unaware she had made her own decision to depart. Her final scenes in the programme were aired on 25 December 1987, attracting nearly 27 million viewers, the highest number in the show&#x27;s history.

In 2005 the UK &quot;TV Times&quot; poll voted her as the &quot;Greatest Soap Opera Star of All Time&quot;. On 6 December 2010, Alexander spoke by telephone to ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; to discuss her time on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on the day of the drama&#x27;s 50th anniversary episode.

===Other roles===
In 1988, Alexander made a guest appearance in the long-running BBC comedy series &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; as Auntie Wainwright, the money-grabbing local junk shop owner. She returned for a second guest appearance in 1989, and finally became a series regular in 1992, remaining until the end of the series in 2010.

Her film credits include &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989) and &quot;Willie&#x27;s War&quot; (1994). Alexander voiced Mrs Santa in the Robbie the Reindeer film &quot;Hooves of Fire&quot; (1999), and also appeared in &quot;Boon&quot; and as Lily in the children&#x27;s series &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot;. She starred with Patricia Hodge and Lionel Jeffries in the comedy series &quot;Rich Tea and Sympathy&quot;, and appeared in the quiz show &quot;Cluedo&quot;. Later, she appeared in &quot;Barbara&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; and &quot;The Afternoon Play&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Alexander never married, stating that she put her acting career first. She was a close friend of her &quot;Coronation Street&quot; husband, Bernard Youens. Her autobiography, &quot;The Other Side of the Street: The Autobiography of Jean Alexander&quot;, was published in 1989.

She lived for many years in Southport, Merseyside, and in 2009 she joined with others to campaign successfully for a temporary library in the town while the central library was being refurbished. She was a keen gardener and after her death was commemorated in the town with a memorial bench at Southport Flower Show, where she was a regular visitor.

She donated her 1955 Qualcast Panther lawnmower to the British Lawnmower Museum in the town, where it is still on display.

Alexander announced her retirement in 2012, two years after her last television appearance. Her acting career lasted for more than 60 years. She celebrated her 90th birthday on 11 October 2016, but was taken ill and died three days later in Southport Hospital.

<doc id="742174" wikidata="Q220811" url="?curid=742174" title="Santa Maria Zobenigo">
<text>The Chiesa di Santa Maria del Giglio is a church in Venice, Italy.

The church, whose name translates into &quot;St. Mary of the Lily&quot; referring to the flower classically depicted as being presented by the Angel Gabriel during the Annunciation), is more commonly known as Santa Maria Zobenigo after the Jubanico family who founded it in the 9th century. The edifice is situated on the Campo Santa Maria Zobenigo, west of the Piazza San Marco. It was rebuilt by Giuseppe Sardi for Admiral Antonio Barbaro between 1678 and 1681 and has one of the finest Venetian Baroque facades in all of Venice. The church is now part of the parish of San Moisè.

== Exterior ==
The exterior lacks any Christian image statues or reliefs. It shows the marble relief maps of various places in which Antonio Barbaro served, including Candia, Zadar, Padua, Rome, Corfu and Split. His own statue, as the chief benefactor, in the center, sculpted by Josse de Corte, is flanked by representations of Honour, Virtue, Fame and Wisdom. The other statues are his brothers. At the top of the facade is the Barbaro family arms carved in relief.

==Interior==
The nave ceiling is decorated with a large canvas by Antonio Zanchi. Along the nave are painted depictions of the &quot;Via Crucis&quot; (1755–1756) or &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot; by various artists, including Francesco Zugno, Gianbattista Crosato, Gaspare Diziani, and Jacopo Marieschi. To the right of the nave entering, the Molin chapel contains a &quot;Madonna and Child with Young St John&quot;, the only painting by the Flemish painter Rubens in Venice. That chapel also has a painting of &quot;St Vincent Ferrer&quot; (1750) by Giovanni Battista Piazzetta and Giuseppe Angeli.

The altar has flanking statues depicting the &quot;Annuciation&quot; by Heinrich Meyring. Behind the high altar, in the sanctuary are paintings of the &quot;Evangelists&quot; by Jacopo Tintoretto. The organ shutters include works by Alessandro Vittoria. Other paintings in the church are by Sebastiano Ricci and Palma the Younger. Giovanni Maria Morlaiter has an additional sculpture found in the second chapel to the right of &quot;San Gregorio Barbarigo&quot;. Another painting by Tintoretto, &quot;Christ with two Saints&quot; in the north aisle, has been damaged by restoration.
==In fiction==
The church and its parish feature in the novel&quot; Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell&quot; by Susanna Clarke; The titular Mr. Strange stays in a house near Santa Maria Zobenigo when he is cursed causing perpetual night to descend on the parish. The church is mentioned in chapter IX, page 77 of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1950 novel, &quot;Across the River and Into the Trees&quot;. Part of the action in Nicolas Remin&#x27;s novel &quot;Venezianische Verlobung&quot; takes place in Santa Maria Zobenigo. The Church is mentioned in Those Who Walk Away by Patricia Highsmith, which is set in Venice.

<text>Naseby is a small town, formerly a borough, in the Maniototo area of Central Otago, New Zealand. It is named after a village in Northamptonshire, England, which was the site of a major battle during the English Civil War. Previous names of the township were Parker&#x27;s, Hogburn and Mt Ida. The town catch phrase is &quot;2000 feet above worry level&quot; indicating its altitude. Naseby is 395 km (5 hours drive) from Christchurch and 143 km (1 hour 45 minutes drive) from Dunedin.

== History ==
An important township during the gold rush of the 1860s, Gold was discovered in the Hogburn in 1863. Much of the town has been preserved from this time and has something of the air of a working museum. At its peak, the population of the town was around 4,000 miners. Eighteen stores, 14 hotels, two butchers and a hospital had also been built to service the miners. In 1898, a railway line was constructed 12 km away in Ranfurly and as a result services gradually moved away from Naseby to Ranfurly. By the time administrative boundaries were changed in the 1980s, it had become New Zealand&#x27;s smallest borough, with a population of only around 100. The Population swells to around 3000 during the summer holiday season.

The local newspaper, the &quot;Mount Ida Chronicle&quot; was produced from 1869 until 1924 and the &quot;Chronicle Office&quot; is now part of the local Naseby Museum and open to visitors.

Winters in Naseby are very harsh for New Zealand with a mean average high temperature of 6 degrees Celsius and a mean average low temperature of 0 degrees Celsius in July.

Naseby is one of New Zealand&#x27;s principal curling venues. The town also has an ice rink and New Zealand&#x27;s only ice luge track (360m long).

Since 1900 Douglas fir, Larch, and Corsican pine have been planted on the former gold fields and these mature trees form the Naseby forest. Mountain biking is very popular in the forest with 52 km of tracks present. A swimming dam just above the township is a popular spot in summer and often freezes over in winter. Walking is also popular in the Naseby forest

The Mount Ida Water Race was built beginning in 1873. The water originates from the Manuherikia River. It winds its way along the Hawkdun Range, and collects water running off the streams as it flows towards Naseby. It was originally designed to feed the gold sluices. It now provides much needed irrigation to farmers in the upper Maniototo area. A track follows the course of the race through the forest and provides pleasant mountain biking and walking opportunities.

==Demographics==
Ranfurly is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement. It covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the much larger Maniototo statistical area. 


Naseby had a population of 123 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 3 people (2.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 9 people (7.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 63 households, comprising 69 males and 54 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.28 males per female. The median age was 55.6 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 12 people (9.8%) aged under 15 years, 9 (7.3%) aged 15 to 29, 60 (48.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 42 (34.1%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 95.1% European/Pākehā, 7.3% Māori, and 4.9% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 56.1% had no religion, 24.4% were Christian and 4.9% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 12 (10.8%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 21 (18.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $24,800, compared with $31,800 nationally. 12 people (10.8%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 45 (40.5%) people were employed full-time, and 24 (21.6%) were part-time.

== Curling ==

The Naseby Indoor Curling Rink was opened in 2006 providing year round curling to enthusiasts and tourists willing to try the sport. The rink is now part of the Maniototo Adventure park and in addition to Indoor Curling, the centre also offers Outdoor Curling, an Ice Luge, Ice Skating and Ice Hockey.

==Education==
Naseby Public School opened in 1865 and closed in 1994. In the early 20th century it included a district high school. The nearest schools are now at Ranfurly.

== Tourism and Recreation ==
Naseby is a popular tourist destination offering visitors a range of experiences. The Naseby forest and recreation area is popular for mountain biking, orienteering and walking with many tracks available throughout the forest. Visitors can follow the Goldfields Heritage Trail making their way through historic goldmining sites and buildings.

There are a range of accommodation options available for visitors to stay including lodges, holiday homes, historic hotels and a holiday park which includes two original miners cottages built in 1893. 

Naseby Night Sky Tours also offers visitors a chance to view through telescopes the incredible sights of night sky.

== In popular culture ==
The cast and crew of the Jane Campion film &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; stayed in Naseby while filming in Ida Valley in the Maniototo. Naseby was used for scenes in &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot; and a Japanese film called &quot;The Promise&quot;.

<text>George Theophilus Walker (June 27, 1922 – August 23, 2018) was an American composer, pianist, and organist, and the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music, which he received for his work &quot;Lilacs&quot; in 1996. Walker was married to pianist and scholar Helen Walker-Hill between 1960 and 1975. Walker was the father of two sons, violinist and composer Gregory T.S. Walker and playwright Ian Walker.

== Biography ==
Walker was first exposed to music at the age of five when he began to play the piano. A graduate of Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.), he was admitted to the Oberlin Conservatory at fourteen, and later to the Curtis Institute of Music to study piano with Rudolf Serkin, chamber music with William Primrose and Gregor Piatigorsky, and composition with Rosario Scalero, teacher of Samuel Barber. He received his doctorate from the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester. Walker taught at Rutgers University in New Jersey for several years, retiring in 1992.

Walker&#x27;s first major orchestral work was the &quot;Address for Orchestra&quot;. His &quot;Lyric for Strings&quot; is his most performed orchestral work. He composed many works including five sonatas for piano, a mass, cantata, many songs, choral works, organ pieces, sonatas for cello and piano, violin and piano and viola and piano, a brass quintet and a woodwind quintet. He published over 90 works and received commissions from the New York Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, and many other ensembles. He was the recipient of six honorary doctoral degrees.

Walker died on August 23, 2018, in Montclair, New Jersey, at the age of 96.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1996, Walker became the first black composer to receive the Pulitzer Prize in Music for his work, &quot;Lilacs&quot; for voice and orchestra, premiered by the Boston Symphony, Seiji Ozawa conducting. Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry proclaimed June 17, 1997, as &quot;George Walker Day&quot; in the nation&#x27;s capital.

In 1997, Walker was awarded the Order of the Long Leaf Pine by North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt.

In 1998, he received the Composers Award from the Lancaster Symphony and the letter of Distinction from the American Music Center for &quot;his significant contributions to the field of contemporary American Music&quot;. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. The following year, George Walker was inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame. [Walker Autobiography, p. 164]

Over the next several years, he received the Dorothy Maynor Outstanding Arts Citizen Award (2000), Classical Roots Award from the Detroit Symphony (2001), the A.I. Dupont Award from the Delaware Symphony (2002) the Washington Music Hall of Fame (2002), and the Aaron Copland ASCAP Award (2012). He was the recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships, two Rockefeller Fellowships, a Fromm Foundation commission, two Koussevitsky Awards, and an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, as well as honorary doctorate degrees from Lafayette College (1982), Oberlin College (1983), Bloomfield College (1996), Montclair State University (1997), Curtis Institute of Music (1997), Spelman College (2001), and the Eastman School of Music where he gave the Commencement Address (2012).
His autobiography, &quot;Reminiscences of an American Composer and Pianist&quot;, was released in 2009 by Scarecrow Press.

== Music ==
Unwilling to conform to a specific style, Walker drew from his diverse knowledge of previous music to create something which he could call his own. While a work such as &quot;Spatials for Piano&quot; uses twelve-tone serial techniques, Walker could also compose in the style of popular music such as in his song “Leaving.” According to Mickey Terry, traces of old black spirituals can also be found in his Violin Sonata No. 2. D. Maxine Sims has stated that Walker&#x27;s piano technique is also reflected in his works, such as his &quot;Piano Sonata No. 2&quot;. This sonata contains changing meters, syncopation, and bitonal writing which all present great challenges for a performer to overcome. BBC Radio 3 devoted five hours to Walker&#x27;s music as &quot;Composer of the Week&quot; in October, 2021.

<doc id="742179" wikidata="Q895264" url="?curid=742179" title="Bourton-on-the-Water">
<text>Bourton-on-the-Water is a village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, that lies on a wide flat vale within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The village had a population of 3,296 at the 2011 census. Much of the village centre is a designated Conservation Area.

==Description==
Bourton-on-the-Water&#x27;s high street is flanked by long wide greens and the River Windrush that runs through them. The river is crossed by five low, arched stone bridges. They were built between 1654 and 1953, leading to the nickname of &quot;Venice of the Cotswolds&quot;.
The village often has more visitors than residents during the peak tourist season. Some 300,000 visitors arrive each year as compared to under 3,500 permanent residents.

There are three churches, Our Lady and St Kenelm Roman Catholic Church, Bourton-on-the-Water Baptist Church and St Lawrence, Church of England. The latter is usually open to visitors during the week. It is a Grade II listed building. A part of it was built in the 14th century but major modifications were made in the 1780s and in the late 1800s.

Educational institutions include Bourton-on-the-Water Primary School and the Cotswold School, a co-educational comprehensive school.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists and includes Cold Aston in addition to Bourton. The total population of the ward at the 2011 census was 3,676. The village itself had 3,296 people; the estimated population in mid-2016 was 3,482.

Bourton-on-the-Water parish is bounded by the Fosse Way along the northwest, while the eastern boundary is defined by a series of brooks, namely Slaughter Brook, the River Dikler and the River Windrush. The southern boundary is associated with a watercourse that runs between Bourton Hill and Broadwater Bottom.

==History==
The earliest evidence of human activity within the Bourton-on-the-Water area was found in the Slaughter Bridge gravel-spread, where Neolithic pottery (dated c. 4000 B.C.) was discovered. Moreover, excavations of the Salmonsbury Camp give evidence of almost continuous habitation through the Neolithic period, the Bronze Age and throughout England&#x27;s Roman period (c. 43 to 410 A.D.). A Roman road, Icknield Street (also known as Ryknild Street), ran from the Fosse Way at Bourton-on-the-Water to Templeborough in South Yorkshire. Ancient Roman pottery and coins discovered in the village itself give clear evidence of extended Roman occupation. By the 11th century a Christian church, Norman, was established and the village had developed along the River Windrush much as it is today. Centuries earlier, a Saxon timber church was located on that site in about AD 708, built on the site of an old Roman temple. Some of the St Lawrence church on that site today was built in the 14th century but most of it is from the 17th and 18th centuries.

The village was served by a passenger railway between 1862 and 1962. Tourism did not become a significant factor in the village until the 1920s and 1930s. The Model Village opened in 1937. There was a significant increase in the population between 1931 and 1951.

Following the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the town, for recruiting, was granted to the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. Following this formation the regiment maintained a troop from B Squadron. Today the regiment, now a squadron of The Royal Wessex Yeomanry, continues to recruit from this area.

The Cotswold School opened in the village in 1988 following the amalgamation of Bourton Vale Secondary Modern (Bourton on the Water) and Westwood&#x27;s Grammar School (Northleach). It achieved academy status in September 2010, and was named &#x27;Comprehensive School of the Year 2015/16&#x27; by The Sunday Times. During construction of the school&#x27;s maths block, it was discovered to be situated upon a Roman cemetery which also contained Iron Age roundhouses, burials, and pottery.

The houses and shops in the village are constructed of the ashlar yellow limestone characteristic of the Cotswolds and they have the embellishments that make Cotswold architecture so picturesque: projecting gables, string-courses, windows with stone mullions, dripmoulds and stone hoodmoulds over the doors.

Parts of the James Bond movie &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002) were filmed in the car park at Bourton-on-the-Water and on the nearby ex-RAF aircraft runway at RAF Little Rissington.

==Special designations==

The small historic core of Bourton-on-the-Water along with associated areas along the River Windrush have been designated a UK Conservation Area.

Salmonsbury Camp, a nearby Iron Age habitation, is designated a UK National scheduled monument (SAM 32392).

English Heritage designates 114 buildings within Bourton-on-the-Water; all have Grade II or Grade II* listed status. (Grade II* indicates particularly important buildings of more than special interest.)

==Tourism==

Bourton has a number of tourist attractions:

* During the summer, a game of medieval football is played with goalposts set up in the River Windrush itself. Two teams play with a standard football and a referee attempts to keep order. Crowds line the banks of the river and the aim is to score as many goals as possible (while getting everyone else as wet as possible).
* The model village is a 1:9 replica of the village and includes a model of the model village itself (a model within a model). It was built by local craftsmen in the 1930s, and opened in 1937. The model village was awarded Grade II listed status in 2013 in recognition of its uniquely precise details and the genuine building materials and methods used, which replicate those used in the construction of the life-size village.
* The model railway
* The Cotswold Motoring Museum (home of &quot;Brum&quot;)
* Birdland Park and Gardens, which has a collection of birds, including penguins, parrots and passerine (perching) birds and a large pond full of salmon which can be fed by the public. There are bird-of-prey displays and a penguin feeding demonstration.
* The Dragonfly Maze, designed by Kit Williams
* On the fourth Sunday of each month, there is a farmers&#x27; market
* Oasis&#x27; music video &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Time&quot; was recorded in the town, and shows Liam Gallagher walking in the countryside of the area, and in the model village and the town.

Long-distance footpaths and local walks start, finish or pass through Bourton-on-the-Water. One such route that begins its 100-mile route north is the Heart of England Way.

==Sport==
The village has its own non-league football club, Bourton Rovers, who play in the Hellenic Football League at the Rissington Road ground.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in Icomb. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, WRFM (Witney Radio) and Cotswolds Radio, community based radio station The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Cotswold Journal&quot;.

==Railway==

Bourton-on-the-Water was first served by rail with the opening of the Bourton-on-the-Water railway in 1862. This was a branch line from on the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OWWR). The station was situated just to the north of the village. The OWWR (and its branch) later amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) and, in 1881, the branch was extended westwards and formed part of the GWR&#x27;s Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway. The station closed to passengers in 1962 and to goods in 1964.

The closest operating railway station now is in Moreton-in-Marsh. The heritage Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway uses part of the route of the former Great Western Railway&#x27;s main line in the Cotswolds; it does not pass through the village.

==Notable people==
* Actor Wilfrid Hyde-White was born in Bourton-on-the-Water in 1903
* Major-general Dudley Johnson, British Army officer and Victoria Cross recipient, was born here in 1884 and fought in the First World War (1914–18).
* Racing cyclist Sharon Laws, who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics, grew up in the village.
* Composer Edwin Ransford.

<text>The Royal Canadian Army Cadets (RCAC; ) is a national Canadian youth program sponsored by the Canadian Armed Forces and the civilian Army Cadet League of Canada. Under the authority of the National Defence Act, the program is administered by the Canadian Armed Forces and funded through the Department of National Defence. Additionally, the civilian partner of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets, the Army Cadet League of Canada, also ensures financial, accommodations and transportation support for RCAC programs and services at a community level.

Many Royal Canadian Army Cadet corps receive logistical assistance and administrative support from their affiliated Regular Force or Reserve Force unit.

While cadets may wear the badges and accoutrements of their affiliated unit, cadets are not members of the Canadian Armed Forces.

With roots in the early drill associations authorized in 1861, Royal Canadian Army Cadets is Canada&#x27;s oldest youth program.

As of 2016, there are approximately 18,920 army cadets in about 429 corps which are spread across the country.

Together with the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and Royal Canadian Air Cadets, it forms the largest federally funded youth program which is known as the Canadian Cadet Organization.

Members of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets are encouraged to become active and responsible members of their communities.

The Royal Canadian Army Cadets are the rough equivalent to the Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps in the United States, the Army Cadet Force in the United Kingdom and the Australian Army Cadets in Australia.

==Overview==
Along with the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and Royal Canadian Air Cadets, the Royal Canadian Army Cadets are a part of the Canadian Cadet Organizations.

The Royal Canadian Army Cadets and other cadet branches are generally administered by the Reserve Force of the Canadian Armed Forces and are federally funded through the Department of National Defence. Additionally, the program is run in partnership with the civilian Army Cadet League of Canada, which provides supervision of the local corps and squadron sponsors which support the program at the community level. The Army Cadet League of Canada ensures financial, accommodations and transportation support for programs and services not provided by the Department of National Defence.

Cadets are not members of the Canadian Armed Forces, and there is no expectation to join the military at a later date. However, former Cadets who do decide to go on to join the military may find that there are certain benefits to be found within the military in certain areas such as basic training (BMQ, BMQ-L and occupation specific training). The service records for members of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets, which are usually digitally created but sometimes physically made, are not destroyed until the age of twenty five. These service records may be very helpful as a reference for future military service.

In keeping with Commonwealth custom, the Royal Canadian Army Cadets stand second in the order of precedence, after the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and before the Royal Canadian Air Cadets.

Youths of any country of origin, nationality and citizenship can join the Royal Canadian Army Cadets, provided that they are 12 to 18 years of age. There is no enrolment fee to join a Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps. Some local sponsors request a voluntary registration fee to assist with expenses not covered by the Canadian Forces such as hall rental. Uniforms, training manuals, and instruction are provided. If a cadet remains in a corps until the day prior to their 19th birthday, then they may be &quot;aged out&quot; following a special ceremony which happens during their final parade night. For example a Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major who is departing a corps will relinquish the senior position by passing on the drill cane or the corps flag to his or her successor. Upon departing the Royal Canadian Army Cadets, most of the items (specifically personal kit) issued to them during their time in the program must be returned.

The organization and rank system of the Canadian Army is used. Cadets are appointed to non-commissioned member ranks and take seniority amongst themselves. A few large school-sponsored cadet corps use Canadian Army commissioned officer designations from Lieutenant to Lieutenant Colonel, a practice that is not officially recognized.

Adult leadership is provided by members of the Canadian Forces Reserve sub-component which is known as the Cadet Organization Administration and Training Service, which is composed mostly of officers of the Cadet Instructor Cadre (CIC) branch. The leadership of each individual corps is supplemented, if necessary, by contracted Civilian Instructors (CIs), authorized adult volunteers, and, on occasion, officers and non-commissioned members of other Canadian Armed Forces branches. The CIC branch is specifically trained to administer and support the Royal Canadian Sea, Army, and Air Cadet training program. Like all other Reserve Force members, they come from all walks of life and all parts of local communities. Some commissioned CIC officers are former cadets themselves, while others may have former Regular Force or Reserve Force service.

===Aim===
The aim of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets is &quot;to develop in youth the attributes of good citizenship and leadership; promote physical fitness; and stimulate the interest of youth in the sea, land, and air activities of the Canadian Forces.&quot; The Royal Canadian Army Cadets shares this aim with the Sea and Air Cadets; however, each focuses on its own element.

=== RCAC Badge ===
The badge of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets is the official emblem of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets. It is worn on the upper sleeve of the cadet uniform and on the breast of the issue parkas. It is also worn as a brass or cloth cap badge in place of an affiliated unit badge or for non-affiliated corps. The motto of &quot;Acer Acerpori&quot; is Latin for &quot;as the maple, so the sapling&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The Royal Canadian Army Cadets (RCAC) can trace its history to the creation of drill associations or militia companies in 1861, predating confederation by six years. These early militia companies and drill associations were not cadet corps but were militia sub-units formed in educational and other public institutions. Enrolment was limited to men between the ages of 13 and 60. The drill was not only a parade square and discipline exercise, but a skill that was necessary for the defence of the Colony. The American Civil War and the threat of the Fenian Raids motivated their creation in Canada East and Canada West.

In 1866, when the Fenians threatened Ontario, the Upper Canada College Rifle Company was called to active service, along with its parent regiment. While the regiment marched to Ridgeway to confront the Fenian invaders, the UCC Rifle Company guarded the port, armouries and government buildings of Toronto. For this deed, the student company proudly carried the battle honour “FENIAN RAID 1865-66” on its drums and colours from that day forward. Students in the battalion who stood guard also were entitled to receive the Canadian General Service Medal, with their names inscribed on the medal’s edge and the “Fenian Raid 1866” bar on its red and white striped ribbon.

Trinity College Volunteer Rifle Company was formed on June 1, 1861 in Port Hope, Ontario. Bishop’s College Drill Association was formed in Lennoxville, Quebec, on December 6, 1861. Another 14 of the early &quot;Drill Associations&quot; or &quot;Rifle Companies&quot; stood up in Ontario and Quebec. Canada&#x27;s oldest continuously-active cadet corps is No. 2 Bishop&#x27;s College School Cadet Corps in Lennoxville, Quebec (Nov. 1879), and No. 7 Royal Canadian Army Cadets in St. Thomas, Ontario (Feb. 1880), both having roots firmly in the previous drill associations.

In 1904, the allocation of numbers to cadet corps was instituted and the Quarterly Militia List, correct to April 1, 1904, lists Cadet Organizations from 1 to 104. The earliest date of organization shown is November 28, 1879, four months after Militia General Order 18 of July 25, 1879 allowed the formations of 74 &quot;Associations for Drill in Educational Institutions&quot; for young men. These cadets were taught drill and marksmanship, but were not required to be employed in active service. The 74 associations included 34 in Ontario, 24 in Québec, 13 in the Maritimes, two in Manitoba, and one in British Columbia.

The origin of the term &quot;cadet corps&quot; is debatable, as some believe it was first used in 1898, in Ontario, bundled in a provision that the corps&#x27; instructors would be members of the local school teaching staff, and not from the local militia unit.

=== Public support ===

Increased support, motivated in part by the Northwest Campaign during the Riel Rebellion of 1885, allowed improved issue of uniforms, weapons and other equipment to schools providing military training.

=== Cadet Instructor Cadre ===
The first authority for cadet instructors to hold rank in the Militia was established by Special General Order Oct. 21, 1903. The appointment was 2nd Lieutenant and the officer was permitted to retain the rank only as long as he remained an instructor and the cadet corps remained efficient. This followed the High School Cadet Instructor&#x27;s Certificate, established in 1898 through the Canadian Militia.

On May 1, 1909 a cadre of commissioned officers, as a Corps of School Cadet Instructors was established. It was composed of qualified male school teachers. On May 1, 1921 the Corps was reorganized on Jan 1, 1924 and designated the Cadet Services of Canada. It was a component of the Canadian Army Non-Permanent Active Militia and the forerunner of the current Cadet Instructor Cadre.

With the integration of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968, the officer cadre was designated as the Cadet Instructors List, a sub-component of the Reserve Force of the Canadian Armed Forces.

In July 1994, it was re-named to the Cadet Instructor Cadre.

In 2009, the Reserve Force sub-component was re-named to the Cadet Organization Administration and Training Service and includes the CIC Branch and former members of the Primary Reserve and Regular Force who retain their previous branch affiliation while serving the Cadet Organization.

==== Strathcona Trust ====
In 1910, Sir Donald Alexander Smith, Lord Strathcona, the Canadian High Commissioner to Britain, created a trust with the Dominion Government with a sum of $500,000, with the aim of inspiring citizenship and patriotism. through physical training, rifle shooting, and military drill. He is remembered today with the Lord Strathcona Medal, which is awarded to a cadet in each corps and squadron who best exemplifies the qualities of being a cadet.

=== World Wars ===

Approximately 40,000 former cadets served in His Majesty&#x27;s forces during the First World War. By the end of the war, there were approximately 64,000 boys enrolled in army cadet corps across Canada.

During the twenty years following the First World War, cadet training came to a standstill. Many corps survived these hard times, but the Great Depression and the lack of public interest caused the cancellation of the uniform grant for army cadets in 1931. The instructional grant for 12 and 13 year olds was additionally cancelled in 1934. In Alberta, only a couple of corps functioned beyond 1934.

The beginning of the Second World War brought a renewed public interest in cadet training. Many cadet corps were raised in high schools across the country.

=== Post-war years ===

In 1942, in recognition of the significant contribution of former cadets to the ongoing war effort, His Majesty King George VI granted the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix to the Canadian Army Cadets, giving it the title of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets. The Royal prefix was also afforded Sea at the same time. Air cadets were given the Royal prefix in 1953 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

It is estimated that nearly 230,000 former army cadets served in His Majesty&#x27;s forces during the Second World War.

After 1945, quotas were imposed, which ended up reducing Canada&#x27;s total cadet membership to approximately 75,000 members. Many of the closed corps, those with membership restricted to boys in one particular school, were disbanded; some of them became open corps, training in Militia armouries or in Legion halls; others acquired their own buildings.

The Korean War stimulated growth among open corps in the early 1950s. Many school corps moved to armouries and drill halls. Regular Force members, many who had served in Korea staffed the Area Cadet Offices that managed the corps and the summer camps.

=== Unification of the Canadian Forces ===

Following the unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, a number of changes occurred in the Army Cadet world:

* QR&amp;O (Cadets) brought Sea and Air Cadet commissioned officers under the single service control of the Canadian Forces and standardized the three Cadet Organizations.
* A directorate of cadets was established in Ottawa, at the Department of National Defence headquarters, to set policy and co-ordinate the activities of the Sea, Army and Air Cadet Organizations.
* The Army Cadet League of Canada was formed in 1971 to provide the Royal Canadian Army Cadets with the same civilian and Canadian Armed Forces partnership structure that was enjoyed by Sea Cadets and Air Cadets through the long established Navy League and the Air Cadet League.
* Officers of the Cadet Services of Canada, The Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and former Royal Canadian Air Force Reserve Cadet Instructors were consolidated in the Cadet Instructor List, which was redesignated the Cadet Instructor Cadre in July 1994.
*The Army Cadet League&#x27;s Arms, Supporters, Flag and Badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on March 31. 1995

=== Females in the cadet program ===

Females were unofficial participants in cadet training almost from the very beginning of cadets.
Shortly after the Highland Cadet Corps was formed at the Guelph Grammar School at Guelph in 1882, an all-female cadet company called the Daughters of the Regiment were started. The Canadian Army provided no support for training or uniforms for the all-female cadet company. In addition, females were prohibited from attending summer training at camps.
On July 30, 1975, the Parliament of Canada amended the relevant legislation by changing the word &quot;boys&quot; to &quot;persons&quot;, therefore permitting females to become members of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets. Therefore, females became full participants in the cadet branch. The biggest change was during the summer training program: what had been for many decades an exclusively male environment changed dramatically at local corps and at Army Cadet Summer Training Centres. Today, males and females are given equality of opportunity as it relates to participating in any and all Royal Canadian Army Cadet corps-level functions.

=== 2004 – 125th anniversary ===

2004 marked the 125th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets. The Army Cadet League of Canada issued a 125th Anniversary pin to be worn by all 25,000+ army cadets across the country at the time. Canada Post honoured the cadets with a stamp which was unveiled in Ottawa in March 2004. Many parades honouring the century-and-a-quarter of cadets occurred across Canada: there were Freedom of the City parades in Vernon, Oromocto and Calgary as well as other major cities and towns across the country. The original Royal Banner was laid up in Vernon during the final battalion parade on August 19 at the Army Cadet Summer Training Centre, and the new Royal Banner was paraded in front of 1,500 cadets and 2,000 members of the audience.

=== Optional Training ===
In the cadet program there are several optional training programs which consist of:

*Military Band and Pipes Band
*Marksmanship
*Biathlon
*First Aid Program
*Drill Team
*Orienteering
*Rappelling
*Parachuting

This optional training is an extension of the mandatory training that cadets receive within their individual corps.

=== Star Level Program ===

The Star Level Program is the main training program carried out by all Royal Canadian Army Cadet corps within Canada. This program is mandated by the Department of National Defence and specifically through the Directorate of Cadets &amp; Junior Rangers.

The Star Level Program is composed of five levels:

*Green Star (Level 1)
*Red Star (Level 2)
*Silver Star (Level 3)
*Gold Star (Level 4)
*Master Cadet (Level 5)

Starting in the 2012-13 training year, the National Star of Excellence or NSE replaced the National Star Certification Examination or NSCE as a ranking tool for Senior Cadets. Year 5 of LHQ training was also introduced as &quot;Master Cadet&quot; consisting of a great deal of On the Job Training (OJT) and self-led professional development opportunities. As of August 4, 2023, the National Star of Excellence program has been phased out.

Cadets are taught a variety of subjects, known as Performance Objectives (PO) that include: citizenship, physical fitness, healthy living, drill, marksmanship, map and compass, outdoor survival, eco-friendly camping and military history and traditions. To better assist in understanding the Star Level training, the Star programs are identified as follows:

=== Summer Training ===
Selected Army Cadets can attend summer training at locations across Canada. The training supports and expands the local headquarters program. Green Star and Red Star cadets attend the Cadet Activity Program (CAP), but Silver Stars, Gold Stars, and Master Cadets attend training courses at Cadet Training Centres (CTC) across the country. CTC courses can last from two to seven weeks. Experienced cadets may apply to be employed as staff cadets to assist the adult instructors at CTCs or CAP.

==== Summer Training Courses ====
Summer Training Courses are as follows (excluding:
==== Cadet Training Centres ====

During the cadets&#x27; summer off-season, some members of the RCAC go to various Cadet Summer Training Centres in which they are picked for around 6-8 months earlier. These are the current CTCs by September 2024:

*Argonaut Cadet Training Centre, which is located at CFB Gagetown.
*Bagotville Cadet Training Centre, which is located at CFB Bagotville.
*Blackdown Cadet Training Centre, which is located at CFB Borden.
*Rocky Mountain Cadet Training Centre, which is located near Cochrane, Alberta.
*Cold Lake Cadet Training Centre, which is located at CFB Cold Lake.
*Connaught Cadet Training Centre, which is located in Ottawa, Ontario.
*St-Jean Cadet Training Centre, which is located in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec.
*Trenton Cadet Training Centre, which is located at CFB Trenton.
*Valcartier Cadet Training Centre, which is located at CFB Valcartier.
*Vernon Cadet Training Centre, which located in Vernon, British Columbia.
*HMCS Quadra, which is located in Comox, British Columbia.
*HMCS Ontario, which is located in Kingston, Ontario.

== Uniform ==
All cadets are issued uniform items for ceremonial and routine training occurrences. Uniforms are provided at no cost to the cadet. Cadets are responsible for care, cleaning and custody of the issued kit and must return it once they are no longer a cadet.

=== Distinctive Elemental Uniform (DEU) ===
Used on ceremonial and formal occasions. All army cadets are issued a Beret of the color of their branch (Majority being dark green), dark green jacket (tunic) with a belt, short-sleeved light green collared shirt, black necktie, green trousers, black web belt with a silver-brass buckle, grey wool socks, and polishable black leather boots. Cadets are also issued a plastic name tag with their last name on it, slip-on ranks, and stand-alone rank insignia which are sewn onto the tunic.

There are a number of authorized accoutrements with the DEU, including white cotton gloves, a white lanyard, and a white nylon belt. These are issued to those cadets in notable positions during parade nights (called &quot;parade positions&quot;). The white lanyard is worn around the left shoulder, and the white nylon belt is worn in place of the standard-issue fabric tunic belt. The white nylon belt comes with a gold-brass buckle stamped with the insignia of the Canadian Armed Forces. Cadets who have been given medals or other awards through the cadet program wear these decorations with the DEU.

Cadets with religious beliefs that require modifications to the uniform, such as those of the Sikh faith, may wear a turban in place of the standard-issue wedge cap.

==== Highland Dress ====
Highland dress is a special order of dress reserved exclusively for those cadets who are pipe band musicians at their corps. Pipe band musicians are issued a Glengarry headdress, a kilt woven with the army cadet tartan, two sporrans (one hair, one leather), hosetops, and white spats. Various accoutrements to the highland dress include a drum major&#x27;s sash, a leopard skin worn on the front of the uniform like an apron, and a sgian-dubh. Only bass and tenor drummers are authorized to wear the leopard skin, and only Pipe Majors are authorized to carry the sgian-dubh.

=== Field Training Uniform (FTU) ===
For their day-to-day training dress (Field Training Uniform (FTU)), cadets are issued a rifle green/dark green/maroon (depending on the branch) beret and a cap badge of the branch fitted in, green elemental t-shirt, olive green tunic, olive green pants, and black multi-purpose boots. The black web belt from the DEU is worn with the FTU pants. Cadets may also be issued an olive green name tape with their last name in dark green lettering, similar in style to those of the Canadian Armed Forces, which is sewn on the FTU tunic.

=== Cold weather uniform items ===
Cadets will be issued a number of uniform items to be worn in instances of cold weather, including an all-season coat, black winter gloves, and a blue toque. Cadets may wear these items &quot;when weather conditions dictate&quot;. The all-season coat comes with a liner and an exterior coat.

=== Numbered orders of dress ===
All cadet uniform items are worn in accordance with the numbered orders of dress. All orders of dress may be worn with cold weather uniform items.
== Ranks ==

Note: Cadet insignia are distinguished from their Canadian Armed Forces counterparts through the inclusion of &quot;CADET&quot; written at the bottom of the slip-on (not shown below).
&quot;*Individual corps may have their own local requirements for promotions, in addition to the national standards (shown above).&quot;

If an Army Cadet Corps has an affiliation with a unit of the Canadian Army that traditionally has different titles for the Ranks of &quot;Lance-Corporal&quot;, &quot;Corporal&quot;, and &quot;Master Corporal&quot;, then they are then entitled to make use of those alternative titles for the ranks of &quot;Lance-Corporal&quot;, &quot;Corporal, and &quot;Master Corporal&quot; in their units as well.

In the guard regiments, Cadet Warrant Officers are known as &quot;Colour Sergeants&quot;

== Music appointments ==

When a corps wishes to create a cadet band, the decision to do so must be made in consultation with the sponsoring committee responsible for provision and maintenance of musical instruments. The cadet music program recognizes two types of bands: military bands and pipe bands. Military bands&#x27; instrumentation includes woodwinds, brass, and/or percussion, while pipe bands&#x27; instrumentation includes pipes and drums. The Regional Support Cadet Unit should provide instruments on loan to their corps to maximize the use of the instruments held by the region and CSTCs and to better support corps training. The music proficiency levels are recognized on the cadet uniform using a system of badges based on the music training programs; the military band badge represents a lyre, while the pipe band badge represents either a pipe or a drum, depending on the instrument played.

The appointment of a Drum Major or Pipe Major is at the discretion of the corps&#x27; CO. Requirements considered include: demonstration of skills and knowledge in band drill, commands and formations, qualification of Music Proficiency Level 2, and holds the minimum rank of Master Corporal. Only one cadet may be appointed as the corps&#x27; Drum Major or Pipe Major at any time.

== Honours and awards ==

The Canadian Cadet Movement maintains its own Honours and Awards system. Cadets may be awarded these based on criteria including bravery, citizenship, service, outstanding performance on a summer training course, and more. In addition, cadets may also wear, on their uniform, any orders, decorations, and medals of Canada they have been awarded.

Within the system, there are several honours and awards common to all three cadet elements and some that are unique to each. A cadet who transfers from one element to another may continue to wear any medals awarded from their previous service, but in general, army cadets may be eligible for the following eight honours and awards, and are in the order of precedence:

<text>Richard B. Holden (7 July 1931 – September 18, 2005) was a lawyer and member of the provincial legislature of Quebec, Canada. An obituary describes him as cynical and self-deprecating, a &quot;boulevardier&quot; and a .

==Personal life==

Richard Holden is the son of John Hastie Holden and Marguerite Holden Hutcheson. His father was an engineer; his grandfather found fortune with a company that procured boots for soldiers during World War I. Holden studied law at McGill University and the Université de Montréal and political science at the Universite de Grenoble.

A litigator, he practiced primarily in the field of personal injury and professional malpractice cases at various law firms from his call to the bar in 1956 until elected to political office in 1989.

He divorced Helene Papachristidis in 1981. He was survived by children Christopher, Arthur, and Caroline.

==Political career==

Holden first entered politics running as an independent candidate in the district of Westmount-Saint-Georges in 1962. He stood opposed to Hydro-Québec&#x27;s nationalization. He finished second, ahead of the Union Nationale candidate.

Holden also ran unsuccessfully for the Progressive Conservatives in the 1979 federal election in the riding of Dollard placing a distant second place.

He was elected to the legislature in the 1989 election in Westmount as a candidate of the federalist, English-rights Equality Party, but was expelled from the party caucus for balking at party discipline.

After briefly sitting as an independent, he shocked his predominantly English-speaking constituents when he crossed the floor to join the sovereigntist Parti Québécois (PQ) in 1992. Holden&#x27;s brother, John Rodney Clement Holden, stopped speaking to him and threatened to change his name as a result of the defection.

Holden ran in the neighbouring Verdun riding in the 1994 election as a PQ candidate. However, he was defeated. After the election, the PQ government appointed Holden to the province&#x27;s rental housing board, on which he served until 1999.

==Death==
Suffering from chronic, debilitating back pain, Holden committed suicide at the age of 74 by jumping from the eighth-floor balcony of his Atwater Market apartment in Montreal.

<text>CTrain (previously branded C-Train) is a light rail system in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Much of the system functions as a high-capacity light metro, while in the downtown free-fare zone, trains run like a modern tram with a dedicated right-of-way. This subway-surface alignment is known as semi-metro.

The CTrain began operation on May 25, 1981, and has expanded as the city has increased in population. The system is operated by Calgary Transit, as part of the Calgary municipal government&#x27;s transportation department. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of , making it one of the busiest light rail transit systems in North America. Approximately 45% of workers in Downtown Calgary take the CTrain to work.

== History ==
The idea for rail transit in Calgary originated in a 1967 Calgary transportation study, which recommended a two-line metro system to enter service in 1978. The original plans had called for two lines:
*a northwest-to-south line (on a similar routing to the present-day Northwest and South lines) between the original Banff Trail station (at Crowchild Trail and Northland Drive, between the present-day Brentwood and Dalhousie stations) and Southwood station (at Southland Drive, roughly at the location of the present-day Southland station, with five stations in downtown underneath 7 Avenue; and
*the west line, which ran from downtown to the community of Glendale, primarily along the 26 Avenue SW corridor.
A third line, a north central line running from downtown to Thorncliffe mostly along Centre Street was also envisioned but was thought to be beyond the scope of the study.

However, a building boom in the 1970s had caused the heavy rail concept to fall out of favour due to the increased costs of construction, with light rail as its replacement. Light rail rapid transit (LRRT) was chosen over dedicated busways and the expansion of the Blue Arrow bus service (a service similar to bus rapid transit today) because light rail has lower long-term operating costs and addressed traffic congestion problems. The Blue Arrow service ended in 2000.

The present-day CTrain originated in a 1975 plan, calling for the construction of a single line, from the downtown core (8 Street station) to Anderson Road (the present-day Anderson station). The plan was approved by City Council in May 1977, with the construction of what would become the C-Train&#x27;s &quot;South Line&quot; beginning one month later. The South Line opened on May 25, 1981. Oliver Bowen, a descendant of original black settlers to Amber Valley, Alberta Obadiah Bowen and Willis Reese Bowen, was the manager of the department that designed and built the original CTrain system. In 2009, the City of Calgary named its largest maintenance facility after Bowen to honour his work. The Oliver Bowen LRT Maintenance Facility (OBMF) in northeast Calgary is a $6.5 million rail facility.

Though the South Line was planned to extend to the northwest, political pressures led to the commission of the &quot;Northeast Line&quot;, running from Whitehorn station (at 36 Street NE and 39 Avenue NE) to the downtown core, with a new downtown terminal station for both lines at 10 Street SW, which opened on April 27, 1985.

The Northwest Line, the extension of the South Line to the city&#x27;s northwest, was opened on September 17, 1987, in time for the 1988 Winter Olympics. This line ran from the downtown core to University station, next to the University of Calgary campus. Since then, all three lines have been extended incrementally, with most of the stations commissioned and built in the 2000s (with the exception of Brentwood which opened in 1990, three years after the original Northwest line opened).

In April 1996, Calgary Transit began piloting a commuter rail service between Anderson station and a temporary station located at 162 Avenue SW, operating a rented Siemens RegioSprinter DMU which ran on CP Rail MacLeod Subdivision tracks. This pilot was intended as a short-term solution to road congestion for the rapidly growing commuter population in South Calgary and as an experiment to test the viability of a South Red Line extension. A new temporary passenger platform was added on the CP Rail line adjacent to Anderson station. The RegioSprinter was travelled between this platform and a platform at 162 Avenue SW located just north of the present-day Somerset–Bridlewood station. This service was only in operation during peak hours and was free-of-charge. Service was discontinued after five months.

The West Line, the extension of the Northeast Line, opened for revenue service on December 10, 2012, as the first new line to open in 25 years. The line runs for 8.2 km from Downtown West–Kerby station on 7 Avenue at 11 Street SW at the west end of Downtown, westward to 69 Street station located at the intersection of 17 Avenue and 69 Street SW.
== Operations ==
=== Lines ===
The CTrain system has two routes, designated as the and the . They have a combined route length of . Much of the South leg of the system shares the right of way of the Canadian Pacific Railway and there is a connection from the light rail track to the CPR line via a track switch near Heritage station.

The longer route (Red Line; serves the southern and northwestern areas of the city. The shorter route (Blue Line; long) serves the northeastern and western sections of the city. Most track is at grade, with its own right-of-way. The downtown portion is a shared right-of-way, serving both routes along the 7th Avenue South transit mall at street level. This portion is a zero-fare zone and serves as a downtown people mover. The tracks split at the east and west ends of downtown into lines leading to the south, northeast, west and northwest residential neighbourhoods of Calgary. Six percent of the system is underground, and seven percent is elevated. Trains are powered by overhead electric wires, using pantographs to draw power.In the first quarter of 2015, the CTrain system had an average of 333,800 unlinked passenger trips per weekday, making it the busiest light rail system in North America. Ridership has declined slightly since reaching this peak, coinciding with a recession in the local economy. In 2007, 45% of the people working in downtown Calgary took transit to work; the city&#x27;s objective is to increase that to 60%.

=== Rolling stock ===
The system initially used Siemens-Duewag U2 DC LRVs (originally designed for German metros), and used by the Frankfurt U-Bahn. The slightly earlier Edmonton LRT, and the slightly later San Diego Trolley were built at approximately the same time and used the same commercial off-the-shelf German LRVs rather than custom-designed vehicles such as were used on the Toronto streetcar system and the Vancouver SkyTrain. U2 vehicles constituted the entire fleet in Calgary until July 2001, when the first Siemens SD-160 cars were delivered. Eighty-three U2 DCs were delivered to Calgary over three separate orders; 27 in 1981, three in 1983, and 53 in 1984 and are numbered 2001–2083. As of March 2020, 39 out of the original 83 U2 DCs remain in service, plus car 2090. The success of the first North American LRT systems inspired Siemens to build an LRV plant in Florin, California. Siemens now supplies one-third of North American LRVs and has supplied over 1000 vehicles to 17 North American systems. This will include 258 vehicles for Calgary when the current order of Siemens S200 vehicles is completed.

The following LRVs have been retired:

Note: units in parentheses in the first row in the above table were retired at end of life, but are also listed in rows below.

In 1988, the Alberta Government purchased from Siemens two U2 AC units, the first of their kind in North America, for trials on both the Edmonton and Calgary LRT systems. The cars were originally numbered 3001 and 3002 and served in Edmonton from 1988 to spring 1990. These LRVs came to Calgary in the summer of 1990 and in September, Calgary Transit decided to purchase the cars from the province and then applied the CT livery to the cars (they were previously plain white in both Edmonton and Calgary). They retained their original fleet numbers of 3001 and 3002 until 1999, when CT renumbered the cars 2101 and 2102. Initially, these two cars were only run together as a two-car consist as they were incompatible with the U2 DCs. In 2003, Calgary Transit made the two U2 ACs compatible as slave cars between two SD-160s and have been running them like this ever since.

In July 2001, Calgary Transit brought the first of 15 new SD-160 LRVs into service to accommodate the South LRT Extension Phase I and increased capacity. Throughout 2003, another 17 SD-160 LRVs were introduced into the fleet to accommodate the northwest extension to Dalhousie as well as the South LRT Extension Phase II. However, demand for light rail has exploded in recent years. In the decade prior to 2006, the city&#x27;s population grew by 25% to over 1 million people, while ridership on the CTrain grew at twice that rate, by 50% in only 10 years. This resulted in severe overcrowding on the trains and demands for better service. In December, 2004, city council approved an order for 33 additional SD-160 vehicles from Siemens to not only address overcrowding, but to accommodate the northeast extension to McKnight–Westwinds and the northwest extension to Crowfoot. These new SD–160s started to enter service in November, 2006. In December 2006, CT extended the order by seven cars to a total of 40 cars, which had all been delivered by the spring of 2008. This brought the total of first-generation SD–160s to 72 cars numbered 2201 – 2272. These cars were all delivered without air conditioning, and retrofitted with air conditioning between 2009 and 2011.

In November 2007 city council approved purchasing another 38 SD-160 Series 8 LRVs to be used in conjunction with the West LRT extension (2012) and further expansions to the northeast (Saddletowne 2012) and northwest legs (Tuscany 2014). These are new-generation train cars with many upgraded features over the original SD-160s including factory equipped air conditioning and various cosmetic and technical changes. These units started to enter service in December 2010 and are numbered 2301–2338. As of May 2012, all had entered revenue service.

In September 2013, Calgary Transit ordered 63 S200 LRVs to provide enough cars to run four-car trains, and to retire some of its Siemens-Duewag U2s, which are nearing the end of their useful lifespans. Some of the 80 U2 cars were 34 years old, and all of them had traveled at least . The first of the new cars arrived in January, 2016 and delivery was expected take two years. The front of the new cars is customized to resemble a hockey goalie&#x27;s mask, and they include such new features as heated floors for winter and air conditioning for summer. They also now have high-resolution video cameras covering the entire interior and exterior of the vehicles for security purposes.

On November 18, 2016, Calgary Transit announced the retirement of the first CTrain LRV purchased, car 2001. Some of the Siemens Duewag U2 cars will be phased out as the new Siemens S200 cars come online.

==== Four car trains ====
In late 2015 Calgary Transit began operating four-car LRT trains on the CTrain system. The lengthening of trains was done to alleviate overcrowding as the system was already carrying more than 300,000 passengers per day, and many trains were overcrowded. The lengthening of trains increased the maximum capacity of each train from 600 to 800 passengers, so when enough new LRT cars arrived to lengthen all trains to four cars, the upgrade increased the LRT system capacity by 33%. Since the platforms on the original stations were designed to only accommodate three-car trains, this required lengthening most of the platforms on the 45 stations on the system and building new electrical substations to power the longer trains. To operate the new four-car trains, the city ordered 63 new cars, although 28 of them were intended to replace the original U2 LRT cars, which have as many as 2.8 million miles on them and are approaching the end of their service lives. Many of the older stations were also worn out by high passenger traffic, and the platforms needed to be rebuilt anyway. Throughout the pandemic, service was reduced to three-car trains. However, as of December 19, 2022, four-car trains are back in service.

== Fares ==

Rides taken solely within the downtown are free; the rest of the network operates under a proof of payment system, with random fare inspections. As of 2022, the downtown area is known as the TD Free Fare Zone and encompasses all CTrain stations along 7th Avenue. Fares and passes could be purchased from ticket vending machines at any station. Coins, debit, and credit cards can be used at the machines, however bills cannot. Fares can also be purchased online through the MyFare app or at a Calgary Transit Customer Service Centre. Day passes and monthly passes can also be purchased. Day passes are valid until the end of service on the day of purchase and monthly passes are valid until the end of the month. Prices are reduced for seniors and students. Children under 12 years old can ride for free, as well as pets. Special low-income passes and senior annual passes are also available, and eligible post-secondary students enjoy unlimited access to the network through the U-Pass (universal transit pass) program.

== Route details ==
There are two light rail lines in operation: the Red Line running from the far southern to the far northwestern suburbs of Calgary (Somerset/Bridlewood–Tuscany), and the Blue Line running from the northeastern to the western suburbs (Saddletowne–69 Street). The routes merge and share common tracks on the downtown transit mall on 7th Avenue South, which also allows buses and emergency vehicles.

=== Downtown Transit Mall ===
As part of the construction of the original South leg, nine single-platform stations were built along the 7th Avenue South transit mall, which formed the 7th Avenue free fare zone. All nine stations opened May 25, 1981. The tracks run at grade in a semi-exclusive right of way, shared with buses, city and emergency vehicles. This is a free-fare zone intended to act as a downtown people mover. Fares are only required after trains exit the downtown core.

Westbound stations used to consist of Olympic Plaza (formerly 1 Street E, renamed in 1987), 1 Street W, 4 Street W, and 7 Street W. Eastbound stations consisted of 8 Street W, 6 Street W, 3 Street W, Centre Street and City Hall (formerly 2 Street E, renamed in 1987).

When the Northeast leg opened on April 27, 1985, two stations were added: 3 Street E serving Westbound Blue Line trains only and 10 Street W, a centre-loading platform, which served as the terminus of both Red and Blue lines, until the Northwest leg opened in 1987, after which it was the terminus for the Blue line only.

As part of Calgary&#x27;s refurbishment project, 3 Street E and Olympic Plaza stations have been decommissioned and replaced by the new gateway City Hall station in 2011. 10 Street W was decommissioned and replaced with the Downtown West–Kerby (formerly called 11 Street W) station in 2012.

==== Downtown station refurbishment ====
In June 2007, the City of Calgary released information on the schedule for the refurbishment of the remaining original downtown stations. The plan involved replacing and relocating most stations, and expanding Centre Street station which was relocated one block east (adjacent to the Telus Convention Centre) in 2000, to board four-car trains. The new stations have retained their existing names (with the exception of 10 Street W becoming Downtown West–Kerby in 2012); however, they may be shifted one block east or west, or to the opposite side of 7th Avenue. The refurbishment project was completed on December 8, 2012, when the Downtown West–Kerby station was opened to the public in conjunction with the West LRT opening event.

*1 Street SW – new platform relocated one block east opened October 28, 2005.
*7 Street SW – new platform relocated one block east opened February 27, 2009.
*6 Street SW – reconstructed in original location. Original platform closed April 7, 2008 and new platform opened March 27, 2009.
*8 Street SW – new platform relocated one block east opened December 18, 2009.
*3 Street SW – reconstructed in original location. Original platform closed April 20, 2009 and new platform opened March 12, 2010.
*3 Street SE – permanently closed May 3, 2010. Replaced by new dual-platform City Hall Station opening July 6, 2011.
*4 Street SW – reconstructed in original location. Original platform closed January 7, 2010 and new platform opened January 21, 2011.
*City Hall – original Eastbound platform rebuilt with new Westbound platform to replace 3 Street E and Olympic Plaza. Original platform closed May 3, 2010 and new dual-platform station opened July 6, 2011. Olympic Plaza was closed permanently at this time. Eastbound platform re-closed following the 2011 Stampede to finish construction and officially opened September 19, 2011.
*Olympic Plaza – permanently closed July 6, 2011. Replaced by new dual-platform City Hall Station.
* – permanently closed and removed on September 15, 2012. The new station replacing it, which opened on December 8, 2012, has dual side-loading platforms and is located one block west. This project was initially proposed to be undertaken in 2006, following the opening of the new 1 Street W station. However, the City of Calgary decided to defer the project to coincide with the opening of the West Line and continue on with refurbishment of the other stations. This new station was initially called &quot;11 Street W&quot; up until the Summer of 2012 when it was renamed to Downtown West–Kerby.

This required that the stations be closed during demolition and reconstruction. The new stations feature longer platforms for longer trains, better integration of the platforms into the sidewalk system, better lighting, and more attractive landscaping and street furniture. This project was shortlisted for the New/Old category in the 2012 World Architecture Festival in Singapore.

=== Red Line ===

Also known as Route 201, this route comprises two legs connected by the downtown transit mall: the South leg () and the Northwest leg (). There are eleven stations on the South leg and nine on the Northwest leg. Total length of the line: .

==== South leg ====
This was the first leg of the system to be built. Seven stations on this leg opened on May 25, 1981, as the first light railway line to serve the city. From north to south, they are (renamed from Stampede in 1995), (renamed from Erlton in 1995), (renamed from 42 Avenue in 1986), , (also the site of the Haysboro LRT Storage Facility), , and (also the site of the Anderson LRT Yards). The original South line was 10.9 km long. On October 9, 2001, the line was extended south 3.4 km and two new stations were added: and , as part of the South LRT Extension Phase I. On June 28, 2004, Phase II opened adding 3 km of track and two more stations: and . A further three stations – Silverado (most likely in the area of 194th Avenue SW), 212th Avenue South, and Pine Creek (in the area around 228th Avenue SW) – are planned once the communities adjacent to their location are developed.
==== Northwest leg ====
This was the third leg of the system to be built. Five stations on this leg opened on September 7, 1987. From the most central to the most northwesterly, they are , (the station name in full is &quot;Southern Alberta Institute of Technology/Alberta University of the Arts/Jubilee Auditorium&quot;), , , and . The original Northwest leg was 5.6 km long. On August 31, 1990, the line was extended 1 km and station was opened as the new terminus. On December 15, 2003, the line was extended 3 km again and station was opened. On June 15, 2009, the line was extended 3.6 km and (formerly Crowfoot-Centennial) was opened. It was extended further by 2.5 km to Station on August 25, 2014.
=== Blue Line ===

Also known as Route 202, this route is composed of two legs connected by the downtown transit mall: the Northeast leg () and the newer West leg (). The Northeast leg has ten stations and the West leg has six stations. Total length of this route: .

==== Northeast leg ====
This was the second leg of the system to be built. Seven stations opened on April 27, 1985, from downtown to the northeast. They are: , , , , , , and . The original Northeast line was 9.8 km long. On December 17, 2007, the line was extended 2.8 km further north to an eighth station – . On August 27, 2012, another 2.9 km extension of track opened and added two more stations – and . Additional stations are proposed for development, likely beyond 2023, at 96th Avenue, Country Hills Boulevard, 128th Avenue (north of Skyview Ranch) and Stoney Trail (in the Stonegate Landing development), as those areas are developed for future LRT infrastructure.
==== West leg ====
This was the fourth leg of the system to be built, although it was included in the original plans for the system. It was built last because it was anticipated to have lower ridership and higher construction costs than the previous legs. Construction of the 8.2 kilometre (5 mile) leg began in 2009. It opened on December 10, 2012.

The City of Calgary began a review process in late 2006 to update the plans to current standards, and Calgary City Council gave final approval to the project and allocated the required $566-million project funding on November 20, 2007. Funding for the project was sourced from the infrastructure fund that was created when the province of Alberta returned the education tax portion of property taxes to the city. Construction of this leg began in 2009. It was constructed at the same time as further extensions of the NE and NW lines of the LRT system that were approved in November 2007.
The West LRT leg has six stations (from east to west): (near 16th Street SW), , , (Westgate), , and (west of 69th Street near Westside Recreation Centre).

The updated alignment from the 2007 West LRT Report includes the line running on an elevated guideway beginning west of the Downtown West–Kerby Station, running along the CPR right of way to Bow Trail SW, and then to 24th Street SW. The line then runs at grade past Shaganappi Point Station and drops into a tunnel to 33rd Street SW. The tunnel then runs under the Westbrook Mall parking lot, and the former site of the now-demolished Ernest Manning Senior High School. The line then follows the north side of 17th Avenue SW past 37th Street SW below grade to 45 Street station. Past 45th Street the line runs at grade, and approaching Sarcee Trail SW moves onto an elevated guideway that passes over the freeway. The line then runs at grade to Sirocco Station, then proceeds to drop below grade and pass under eastbound 17th Avenue SW at 69th Street SW and return to grade on the south side of the avenue. The line then terminates at 69 Street Station located to the west of 69th Street SW.

Three of the new West leg stations are located at grade. , , and stations are located below grade, while is an elevated station. On October 5, 2009, the city council announced approval of a plan to put a portion of the West leg into a trench at 45th Street and 17th Avenue SW, a move welcomed by advocates who fought to have it run underground. The change cost an estimated $61 million; however, lower-than-expected construction costs were expected to absorb much of the change.

The cost for the project is, however, over budget by at least C$35 million and the overall cost could be more than C$1.46 billion because of soaring costs of land used and the integration of public art into the project. The public art aspect of the project was neglected in its initial form. Because City Hall regulations for big construction projects require incorporation of public art, City Hall had to find the money. Therefore, the West LRT project cost C$8.6 million more than expected.

On October 29, 2009, city council announced that the contract to construct the West LRT had been awarded to a consortium led by SNC Lavalin.

Future extension of the West leg to Aspen Woods Station (around 17th Avenue and 85th Street SW) has been planned, and future extensions further west to 101st Street SW may be added as new communities adjacent to 17th Avenue SW are built.

On May 15, 2012, testing of the leg began with two LRT cars. As the construction of the leg moved towards completion, four LRT cars were used, until revenue service began on December 10, 2012.

In its first year of service, 69 Street served an average of 32,400 boardings per day.

In 2011, Calgary City Council directed that a long term Calgary Transit Plan be created, taking into account the overall Calgary Transportation Plan. A steering committee and project team, comprising some Council members, City planning staff, independent business people and Calgary Transit staff, after detailed scenario planning and extensive public consultation, produced the December 2012 &quot;RouteAhead: A Strategic Plan for Transit in Calgary&quot;. A 30-year roadmap for public transit in Calgary, RouteAhead includes a long-term vision for the CTrain system. The RouteAhead plan was submitted to Council and approved in early 2013.

=== Existing Lines ===
For the Red Line, in its 30-year RouteAhead plan, the South line may be extended another 3.5 km to a possible 210 Avenue SW station.

For the Blue Line, from the same plan, there are more possible extensions to the northeast to either Calgary International Airport (via a spur line), or to 128 Avenue NE, or to have both. There is also a long-term plan in RouteAhead that says the Blue Line will be extended past Stony Trail.

There are plans to build an additional line to the southeast from the city centre. Calgary Transit has drafted a plan for a transit-only right-of-way, known as the SETWAY (South East Transit Way) for the interim. A second, northern line is to be planned beyond 2023 but the alignment is still pending.

As for a possible underground leg in downtown (under 8 Avenue South), the cost of the project will be at least C$800 million (in 2012 dollars), but its priority has been lowered because there is no funding available for it. However, the overall cost of this and other projects could be at least C$8 billion.

=== Green Line ===
This potential route may cross the downtown core at right angles to the downtown transit mall and connect two new legs: the Southeast leg and the North-Central leg. To avoid capacity constraints on the existing downtown transit mall, it was designed as a separate line, running underground for 4 stations through downtown and the Beltline neighbourhood. It will feature a connection to the Red and Blue lines at 7 Avenue SW station.

The Green Line may stretch from 16th Avenue North through the downtown core into the Southeast to the future Shepard Station at 126th Avenue SE. The $4.6 billion cost of the project will be shared in roughly equal portions between the federal government, the city of Calgary and the provincial government.

==== North leg ====
This leg of the Green Line would serve the residential communities of Country Hills, Coventry Hills, Harvest Hills, Panorama Hills, and other communities, possibly in the future extending as far as the nearby City of Airdrie. The Green Line North, as it has been re-designated, will be a mix of grade level and underground infrastructure extending north from the downtown core along Centre Street North.

In July 2015, the Canadian federal government committed to put $1.5 billion into funding the Green Line LRT or one-third of the project&#x27;s $4.6 billion cost. Discussions between the city of Calgary and the province continue with the goal of building the new light rail line instead of developing a BRT system as an interim measure.

In January, 2015, Calgary City Council approved the Green Line North (formerly known as North Central LRT), setting Centre Street N as the route. In December 2015, Council approved the planning report on Green Line funding, staging, and delivery. Actual completion dates will depend on delivery of promised federal and provincial government funding.

Currently in the RouteAhead plan, there is also a long-term plan to extend the north leg to Airdrie. It&#x27;s not exactly certain what route it would take from the current planned terminus.

==== Southeast leg ====
This leg is planned to run from downtown (although on a different routing, not following the 7th Avenue corridor) to the communities of Douglasdale and McKenzie Lake and McKenzie Towne in the southeast, and onwards past Highway 22X into the so-called &quot;Homesteads&quot; region east of Deerfoot Trail.

Eighteen stations have been planned for this route and the project is expected to be completely built by 2039.

Three of the proposed downtown stations are expected to be built underground, and the rest of the line will follow the 52 Street SE corridor from Douglasdale and McKenzie Towne to Auburn Bay (south of Highway 22X) and then wind its way through Health Campus (adjacent to the southeast hospital) and Seton. Unlike Routes 201 and 202, which use high-floor U2 and SD-160 LRVs, the eastern route is expected to employ low-floor LRVs, such as the Bombardier Flexity Outlook or the Siemens S70.

From north to south, the proposed stations are: Eau Claire, Central (at 6 Avenue), Macleod Trail, 4 Street SE, Ramsay/Inglewood, Crossroads, Highfield, Lynnwood, Ogden, South Hill, Quarry Park, Douglasglen, Shepard, Prestwick, McKenzie Towne, Auburn Bay/Mahogany (at 52nd Street), Health Campus/Seton (the station likely will share the name of the hospital and expected to be completed by 2039), with further stations to the south expected in the future.

Construction of the South East LRT would cost over C$2.7 billion over 27 years. Because there was no funding available, the city laid out plans to build a transit way for the South East BRT known as SETWAY. Open houses to explore the idea of a transit way for the South East occurred in the South East communities of Ramsay, Riverbend and McKenzie Towne in January 2012. Between 1999 and 2006 Calgary Transit conducted studies for the South East LRT to find ways to make improvements of overall transit use in the South East for short term while having LRT being the long-term goal.

On December 3, 2016, it was announced that an additional C$250 million in additional funding was allocated in a joint venture by the Federal and Provincial Governments. This comes in line with a possible final cost estimate of the South East LRT to be announced in March 2017.
=== Spur line to Calgary International Airport ===
Calgary Transit&#x27;s C$8 billion, 30-year RouteAhead plan, approved in 2013, includes a connection from downtown Calgary to Calgary International Airport, which may take initial form as a Route 202 spur line. The Airport Trail road tunnel, which opened on May 25, 2014, was built with room to accommodate a future two-track CTrain right-of-way.

=== Future MAX (BRT) light rail conversion ===
RouteAhead currently suggests a long-term light rail (LRT) conversion of the MAX Purple BRT route.

=== Other future improvements ===
In late 2015, Calgary Transit completed upgrading its entire system to operate four-car trains instead of the original three-car trains. When enough new LRVs are delivered to lengthen all trains to four cars, this will increase the rush-hour capacity of the system by 33%. By 2023, Calgary Transit also plans to begin decommissioning some of the original Siemens-Duewag U2s (as of 2010 80 of the original 83 were in use, and nearing 29 years of service, by 2023 they will be 42 years old). Calgary Transit has ordered some 60 new Siemens S200 LRV cars to replace 28 of the existing U2s in addition to lengthening many of the trains to four cars. Calgary transit has also integrated a new mobile ticketing system which allows riders to buy CTrain and other Calgary Transit tickets and passes anytime from anywhere with the use of a smartphone. This system, dubbed &quot;My Fare&quot; was rolled out at the end of July 2020, but faced issues at launch such as the incompatibility with Apple&#x27;s iOS devices.

=== Further underground infrastructure ===
In addition to numerous tunnels to allow trains to pass under roadways, geographic features, and mainline railways, there are other notable underground portions of Calgary&#x27;s CTrain system.

Part of the system through downtown is planned to be transferred underground when needed to maintain reliable service. Given this, portions of the needed infrastructure have been built as adjacent and associated land was developed. As a result of this original plan, when the City of Calgary built a new Municipal Building, it built a short section of tunnel to connect the existing CPR tunnel to the future tunnel under 8th Avenue S. The turnoff to this station is visible in the tunnel on the Red Line entering downtown from the south, shortly before City Hall. However, after urban explorers discovered the tunnel and visited it during a transit strike, the city walled off the spur tunnel with concrete blocks.

As the population of metropolitan Calgary increases and growing suburbs require new lines and extensions, the higher train volumes will exceed the ability of the downtown section along 7th Avenue S to accommodate them. To provide for long-term expansion, the city is reviewing its plans to put parts of the downtown section underground. The current plans allow the expanded Blue Line (Northeast/West) to use the existing 7th Avenue S surface infrastructure. The expanded Red Line (Northwest/South), now sharing 7th Avenue S with the Blue Line, will be relocated to a new tunnel dug beneath 8th Avenue S. The future Southeast/Downtown route will probably enter downtown through a shorter tunnel under one or more streets (candidates include 2nd Street W, 5th Street W, 6th Street W, 8th Avenue S, 10th Avenue S, 11th Avenue S, and 12th Avenue S). Although Calgary City Council commissioned a functional study for the downtown metro component of the CTrain system in November 2007, the city is unlikely to complete this expansion before 2017 unless additional funding is received from provincial or federal governments. The cost of bringing the potential underground leg under 8 Avenue South could be at least C$800 million, according to Calgary Transit&#x27;s 30-year RouteAhead plan.

== Stations ==
There are 45 stations in the CTrain system on 2 distinct lines. The typical station outside the downtown core allows for several passenger arrival and departure methods. Many CTrain passengers travel to and from suburban stations on feeder bus routes that wind their way through surrounding neighbourhoods. Another popular option is a park and ride lot, in which commuters drive or bike to a station by car or bicycle and then transfer to a CTrain to complete their journey. Alternatively, some CTrain passengers disembark at drop-off zones from vehicles travelling elsewhere; because commuters at the time of the system&#x27;s opening were sometimes conveyed by their spouses, these zones were once branded as Kiss and Ride areas.

== Ridership ==
The CTrain&#x27;s high ridership rate and cost effectiveness can be attributed to a number of factors. The nature of Calgary itself has encouraged CTrain use. Calgary has grown into the second largest head office city in Canada, with a very dense downtown business district. Most of the head offices are crowded into about of land in the downtown core. In the last half century the population of Calgary has grown dramatically, outpacing the ability of roads to transport people into the city centre, while the central business district has grown up vertically rather than spread out into the suburbs.

Historically, Calgary residents, particularly its influential inner city community associations, voted against proposals to build major freeways into its city centre, forcing new commuters to use transit as their numbers increased while downtown street and freeway capacity remained the same. City planners limited the number of parking spaces in the downtown core since the narrow downtown streets could not allow more traffic to park. At the same time, Calgary&#x27;s maturation as a globally influential head office city caused many surface parking lots to be replaced by new skyscrapers, which increased office workers while reducing parking spaces. This eventually made it prohibitively expensive for most people to park downtown. The shortage of downtown parking caused fees to become among the most expensive in North America. As a result, in 2012 50% of Calgary&#x27;s 120,000 downtown workers used Calgary Transit to get to work, with a long-term goal of growing that proportion to 60% of downtown workers.

Forward planning for the CTrain played an important role. Although the light rail system was not chosen until 1976, the city planners had proactively reserved transit corridors for some form of high capacity transport during the 1960s, and the right-of-ways for the system were reserved when Calgary&#x27;s population was less than 500,000, whereas today it is well over twice that number. Bus rapid transit lines were put in place along future routes to increase commuter numbers prior to constructing proposed future LRT lines. Rather than demolishing buildings, the city reached an agreement with CP Rail to build most of the south line in available space inside an existing CPR right-of-way. Large parts of the other lines were built in the medians and along the edges of freeways and other major roads. Automobile driver objections were muted by adding extra lanes to roads for cars at the same time as putting in the LRT tracks, which reduced costs for both, and by adding grade-separating intersections which reduced both driver and train delays. The lines and stations were placed to serve large outlying suburbs and the central and other business districts, and to serve existing and predicted travel patterns.

Costs were controlled during construction and operation of the system by going with the lowest bidder and using relatively cheap, commercially available technology without regard for &quot;buy Canadian&quot; policies. This has worked out well for a pioneer system because the German technology chosen has since become a more or less standard design for most North American LRT systems, and compatible new-generation equipment with new features is available off-the-shelf. A grade-separated system was passed over in preference for a system with few elevated or buried segments, and the trains and stations selected were of the tried and tested, utilitarian variety (for example, vehicles were not air conditioned, storage yards were not automated, and stations were usually modest concrete platforms with a shelter overhead). This allowed greater amounts of track to be laid within available budgets. The CTrain reduced fare collection costs by using an honour system of payment. Transit police check passenger tickets at random, and fines are set at a level high enough that those who are caught pay the costs for those who evade detection. Staffing costs were kept low by employing a minimum number of workers, and because the system is all-electric (wind powered) it can run all night with only 1 driver per train and 2 people in the control room. It now runs 22 hours per day without significantly increased overhead. (The other 2 hours are reserved for track maintenance).

Although not universally grade separated, the CTrain is able to operate at high speeds on much of its track because it is separated from traffic and pedestrians by fences and concrete bollards. The downtown 7th Avenue transit way is limited to trains, buses, and emergency vehicles, with private cars prohibited. Trains are given priority right of way at most road crossings outside of downtown. As a result, trains are able to operate at outside of downtown, and along the 7th Avenue corridor. 7th Avenue is a free fare zone, intended as a downtown people-mover to encourage use for short hops through the downtown core. The city manages to achieve very high transit capacity on the 7th Avenue transit corridor by staging the traffic lights, so that all the trains move forward in unison to the next station on the synchronized green lights, and load and unload passengers on the intervening red lights. The trains are now 1 block long, but buses occupy the empty gaps every second block between trains and the buses unload and load passengers while the trains pass them.

In 2001, the U.S. General Accounting Office released a study of the cost-effectiveness of American light rail systems. Although not included in the report, Calgary had a capital cost of US$24.5 million per mile (year 2000 dollars), which would be the sixth lowest (Edmonton was given as US$41.7 million per mile). Because of its high ridership (then 188,000 boardings per weekday, now over 300,000) the capital cost per passenger was $2,400 per daily passenger, by far the lowest of the 14 systems compared, while the closest American system was Sacramento at $9,100 per weekday passenger). Operating costs are also low, in 2005, the CTrain cost $163 per operating hour to operate. With an average of 600 boardings per hour, in 2001 cost per LRT passenger was $0.27, compared to $1.50 for bus passengers in Calgary.

<text>Holdemar Menezes (December 13, 1921 – August 19, 1996) was a Brazilian writer.

He was born in Aracati, in the state of Ceará, as the third child of Ezequiel Silva de Menezes and Otília Oliveira de Menezes. He moved to Rio de Janeiro where in 1949 he earned his degree from the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro (&quot;Escola de Medicina e Cirurgia do Rio de Janeiro&quot;) – his practice was gynaecology and obstetrics. After finishing his residency in Rio, he moved to the state of Santa Catarina: first to São Francisco do Sul, and soon after to Florianópolis.

Despite his work as a medical doctor, Holdemar dedicated a great part of his life to writing. Even though he was never a full-time writer he managed to produce quality work and had great impact in the Brazilian literature. In 1972, his work was recognised in Brazil with the Jabuti prize (one of the most respected literature prizes in Brazil) for his book &quot;A Coleira de Peggy&quot;. For all his body of work, Holdemar is considered an immortal by the Academy of Literature of Santa Catarina (&quot;Academia Catarinense de Letras&quot;).

<text>The Chiesa di San Moisè (or San Moisè Profeta) is a Baroque style, Roman Catholic church in Venice, northern Italy.

==History==
The church was built initially in the 7th century. It is dedicated to Moses since like the Byzantines, the Venetians often considered Old Testament prophets as canonized saints. It also honours &quot;Moisè Venier&quot;, the aristocrat who funded the reconstruction during the 9th century.

San Moisè is the parish church of one of the parishes in the Vicariate of San Marco-Castello. The other churches within the parish are Santa Maria Zobenigo, San Fantin, Santa Croce degli Armeni and the Basilica of San Marco itself.

==Exterior==
The elaborate Baroque façade, dating from 1668, is profusely decorated with sculpture. Some of its sculptures are generally attributed to the German artist Heinrich Meyring. The architectural design is attributed to Alessandro Tremignon, with patronage by Vincenzo Fini, whose bust is found over the entry door. Statues in public spaces were forbidden in Venice, thus by putting his bust on the façade of a church, he could circumvent this ordinance and display his wealth and his recent addition to the Libro d&#x27;Oro of Venetian aristocracy.

==Interior==
The interior is dominated by Meyring&#x27;s huge and mannerist sculptural set piece and altarpiece, depicting &quot;Moses at Mount Sinai receiving the Tablets&quot;, created by Tremignon and Meyring. Behind it is a canvas painted by Michelangelo Morlaiter. It also has a &quot;Washing of the Feet&quot; by Tintoretto, and a &quot;Last Supper&quot; by Palma il Giovane. The altarpiece of the &quot;Deposition&quot; (1636) was painted by Niccolò Roccatagliata in collaboration with Sebastiano.

John Law, originator of the bankrupt Mississippi Scheme, is buried in the church.

<text>Beit Jala () is a Palestinian Christian town in the Bethlehem Governorate of Palestine, in the West Bank. Beit Jala is located 10 km south of Jerusalem, on the western side of the Hebron road, opposite Bethlehem, at altitude. In 2017, Beit Jala had 13,484 inhabitants according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. About 80% of the population were Christians (mostly Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic) and about 20% Muslims.

Saint Nicholas – the inspiration for Santa Claus – is the patron saint of Beit Jala, where the Church of Saint Nicholas was built over a crypt where it is believed he lived for a couple years during his time in Palestine.

== Etymology ==
Conder and Kitchener identified Beit Jala with &quot;Galem&quot; or &quot;Gallim&quot; (Γαλλιμ) of the Septuagint, a place in the 9th district of the inheritance of Judah; homonymous with a settlement in Benjamin NE of Jerusalem.

==History==

===Byzantine period===
A crypt, dating to the 5th or 6th century C.E., was located under the Church of Saint Nicholas in Beit Jala.

===Crusader period===
In the Crusader era, the village was called Apezala, and the Church of Saint Nicholas was possibly rebuilt during that time.

===Ottoman period===
In 1516, the village was included in the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine. In this century, Beit Jala was a large village of Christian and peasants and it had over ten elders (&quot;akabir&quot;) who functioned as leaders, with each religious group having separate sets of leaders. Rare for a single village, it and nearby Bethlehem, served as its own separate jurisdiction instead of being grouped with other villages into a &quot;nahiya&quot;. In April 1531, when an Ottoman official went to Beit Jala to register the village&#x27;s grapevines for tax purposes, the residents refused to seriously answer his questions and mocked the authority of the Ottoman sultan, marking a notable episode of initial local resistance to the Ottoman taxation methods and procedures. By the end of the 16th century, Beit Jala was almost entirely inhabited by Christians. Beit Jala&#x27;s size rendered it similar to that of a town, with the village being subdivided into four quarters. The village produced more wheat and barley than surrounding localities and like other villages south of Jerusalem, grape cultivation was greater than olive cultivation. Beit Jala was taxed on these agricultural products as well as figs, honeybees, and goats. It contained one of the six olive presses in the subdistrict of Jerusalem in the 16th century. Despite its large size, Beit Jala was relatively poorer than other villages in the subdistrict.

In the 1596 tax-records, it appeared as &quot;Bayt Jala&quot;, located in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Jabal Quds of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Al-Quds. The population was 245 households; 6 Muslims and 239 Christians. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3% on agricultural products, which included wheat, barley, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, occasional revenues, goats and beehives; a total of 30,000 akçe.

In 1697 Henry Maundrell passed Beit Jala, and noted that: &quot;no Turk can live in it above two years. By virtue of this report, whether true or false, the Christians keep the Village to themselves without molestation; no Turk being willing to stake his life experimenting the truth of it.&quot;

In the 17th century, the Christians of Beit Jala offered to become Catholic if the Franciscans paid their jizya tax.

Beit Jala&#x27;s inhabitants participated in the 1834 peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine against Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian governor of Syria. Beit Jala&#x27;s residents were believed to have taken part in the looting of Egyptian property and on 31 May, Egyptian troops assaulted the village. Ibrahim Pasha put a stop to the attack, but at least 33 men and women were killed in the attack. In addition, the village&#x27;s livestock was seized. The attack on Beit Jala prompted rebels from the Ta&#x27;amira tribe, a local Bedouin tribe, to enter into Bethlehem to help bolster its defense.

In 1838, it was noted as a Greek Christian village, located in the &quot;Beni Hasan&quot; area, west of Jerusalem. The population was estimated to be around 2000 people.

By the mid-19th century, there were 10 Catholics living in Beit Jala. The Latin Patriarchate founded its first parish in Palestine in Beit Jala in 1853. The establishment of the parish faced fierce resistance by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the inhabitants of Beit Jala, leading to several skirmishes and official complaints to the Ottoman authorities by both sides. A Latin church was built in Beit Jala and inaugurated on 18 April 1858. The Jerusalem Society, a Protestant movement struggled to maintain a presence in Beit Jala in the late 19th century. When a clash between Orthodox and Protestant residents ended with the death of an Orthodox girl, the village&#x27;s Protestant community was evacuated to al-Karak in Transjordan for six months until compensation was paid to the family of the slain girl. In 1866, the Russian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire purchased land in Beit Jala and built a girls&#x27; school, the first Russian school to be built in Palestine. It had 60 pupils by 1880 and was assigned a Russian principal. In 1886, it became a teachers&#x27; training school and was under the administration of the Palestinian Orthodox Imperial Society.

Albert Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Beit Jala had 234 houses and a population of 874 &quot;Latins&quot;, though the population count included men, only. Martin Hartmann found that Beit Jala had 232 houses.

In 1883, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described &quot;Beit Jala&quot; as: &quot;A large and flourishing village of white well-built stone houses, on the slope of a steep hill. The water supply is artificial, with a well in the valley below. The population is said by Pere Lievin to amount to 3,000, of whom 420 are Catholics, and the rest Orthodox Greeks. There is a Greek and a Latin church in the village. There are remarkably fine groves of olives round and beneath the village, and the hill is covered with vineyards which belong to the place.&quot;

In 1896 the population of Beit Jala was estimated to be about 2,880 persons.

===British Mandate period===

In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Beit Jala had a population of 3,101; 3,060 Christians and 41 Muslims; where the Christians consisted of 2,628 Orthodox, 358 Roman Catholics, 4 Greek Catholic (Melkites), and 1 each of the Armenian Catholic, Maronite and the Coptic Church. In the 1931 census the population had decreased to 2,731; 2,529 Christians, 198 Muslims, 3 with &quot;no religion&quot; and 1 Jew; in a total of 631 inhabited houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Beit Jala was 3,710; 200 Muslims and 3,510 Christians, with 13,307 (rural) and 737 (urban) dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 9,860 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 1,064 for cereals, while 737 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

By the end of the Mandate, the population of Beit Jala was apprixmately 4,000. 

===Jordanian period===
In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Beit Jala came under Jordanian rule.

The Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) began relief operations for refugees in the West Bank in 1950. They also worked with Palestinians who had retained their houses and so were not technically refugees, but who had lost their land or means of making a living because of the war. As part of this relief, the MCC founded a school in Beit Jala which was still in operation as of 1979.

In 1952, an Israel Defense Forces reprisal raid in Beit Jala killed seven civilians; one man, two women and three children. A complaint was lodged that Israel had violated the General Armistice agreement. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation issued a condemnation of Israel for breaching the agreement.

In 1961, the population of Beit Jala was 7,966.

=== Post 1967 ===
Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Jala has been under Israeli occupation. Control of the town was assumed by the Palestinian Authority following the 1993 Oslo Accords. According to the Beit Jala Municipality, the city&#x27;s land holdings have been relegated under different areas of administration. Area A comprises approximately 3,500 dunums, or about 25% of the town&#x27;s land, which is under Palestinian control. The remaining 75% (Area C) is under Israeli jurisdiction, and 7% of the total Area C is located inside the Municipality border.

According to ARIJ, after the war Israel confiscated 3,147 dunums of Beit Jala land in order to expand the Jerusalem municipal boundaries, later taking further land for the two Israeli settlements of Gilo and Har Gilo, the West Bank barrier and bypass roads.

During the Second Intifada, militants from the Fatah-affiliated Tanzim group used Beit Jala as a base for launching sniper and mortar attacks on the Israeli settlement of Gilo. Gilo is located on a hilltop across from Beit Jala, partially built on the lands of Beit Jala, Beit Safafa and Sharafat. The Israeli government built a concrete barrier and installed bulletproof windows in homes and schools facing Beit Jala.

Militants were reported to have used the houses of Palestinian Christian residents to fire on Israeli targets in Gilo. Fighters were initially welcomed by residents, but after their homes were attacked by Israeli retaliatory fire and several fighters and residents were killed, they no longer tolerated the militants&#x27; presence. According to John Bunzl, the Israeli press used the incident to suggest there was a Christian-Muslim conflict in the incidents, with the former trying to prevent an attack until the Muslims forced them to surrender. Numerous statements taken from Christian residents appear to refute this. In August 2001, the Israeli Army occupied the northeastern corner of Beit Jala, declaring that it would only leave when the gunfire on Gilo stopped. Two days later, the troops withdrew. Palestinian militants subsequently increased their attacks, adding mortars and heavy machine guns. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the Palestinian militants were not locals, but took up positions in Beit Jala due to its proximity to Gilo. In August 2010, after a long period of calm, the concrete barrier built to protect Gilo was removed.

The Israel barrier in the West Bank will separate over 50 Beit Jala families from their land; although Israel says it is a vital security measure. Palestinians believe the ultimate aim of the barrier is a land grab as it is built inside the occupied West Bank on land Palestinians want for a future independent state. Local church leaders - Latin Catholic and Greek Orthodox - have been involved in the campaign to prevent the construction of the barrier.

==Geography==
The Israel bypass road known as the Tunnels Highway passes directly underneath Beit Jala.

==Demographics==
This town&#x27;s Christian inhabitants are made up of five Christian tribes that trace their origins as Aramaic-and Arabic speaking people who lived in that area near Bethlehem prior to the Muslim conquest in 634. At the 1931 census of Palestine the population of Beit Jala was 2,732. This included 196 Muslims, 2,532 Christians, and one Jew. In 1947, Beit Jala had a population of approximately 3,700. In 1967, according to a census conducted by the Israeli Army Command, the population was 6,041. The population in 2007 was 11,758 according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.

==Economy==
Cremisan Cellars, located in the Cremisan monastery, is an important local winemaker. The winery has operated since the establishment of the monastery in the 19th century. Modern equipment was introduced in 1997. Beit Jala was once famous for its pork, olive oil, apricots and stone masonry. Other economic branches are tobacco, textiles, agriculture and pharmaceuticals. The Beit Jala Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company (formerly Jordan Chemical Laboratory) was established in 1958 to manufacture generic drug pharmaceutical products for the local market.

The West Bank Barrier is being extended to encircle the area, splitting the monastery, which would end up on the Israeli side, from the sister Salesian convent, and making access to this recreational area for Beit Jala residents very difficult. 57 Christian families are slated to lose their agricultural property.

==Health care==

Beit Jala has a government-run 113-bed hospital, and a 77-bed privately run specialized surgery hospital operated by the Arab Society for Rehabilitation. Primary health care is provided by the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health. In addition, there are many charities, medical institutions and private health clinics. Societies for the disabled in Beit Jala include the Bethlehem Arab Society, Lifegate Rehabilitation and House Jemima, a Dutch-founded home and daycare-center for children with mental disabilities. Al-Hussein Governmental Hospital, Beit Jala is a government hospital here.

==Schools and religious institutions==

Beit Jala is home to educational institutions run by a variety of Christian denominations, including the Arab Orthodox Benevolent Society. A Russian Orthodox school was established in 1866. The Latin Patriarchate Seminary, which supervises religious liturgical education in the Jerusalem Patriarchate, moved to Beit Jala in 1936.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land (ELCJHL) has a congregation in Beit Jala. The denomination also runs the Talitha Kumi School in Beit Jala, which was founded by Lutheran deaconesses in the 19th century and relocated in Beit Jala in 1961. The school has developed an environmental education program and operates the only bird-ringing station in the Palestinian sector. The school also runs a guesthouse.

The Beit Jala skyline is dominated by several churches, among them the Church of the Virgin Mary, the Church of St. Michael, and the Church of Saint Nicholas. According to tradition, St. Nicholas spent four years in a cave beneath the Church. These three churches belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. The Latin Church of Annunciation is the Catholic church built in 1850.

The Syriac Orthodox Church runs the Mar Afram school in Beit Jala. In 2007, Mar Afram started offering classes in Aramaic (more specifically, Syriac Aramaic) to its students, which were taught by elderly residents of the town who still spoke the waning language fluently.

==Local government==
In the 2005 municipal election, six seats went to the United Beit Jala list (Fatah and Palestinian People&#x27;s Party), five seats went to Sons of the Land (PFLP and independents), one seat went to Independent Beit Jala Group and one candidate was elected as an independent. The most popular candidate was Raji George Jadallah Zeidan of United Jala with 2,892 votes, followed by Nadir Antoun Issa Abu Amsha of Sons of the Land with 1764 votes.

== Sports ==
The Beit Jala Lions is a rugby club active in Beit Jala since 2007. Hailed as the first all-Palestinian rugby team in history, the team is made up almost exclusively of residents of Beit Jala.

<text>Easter Compton is a village in the civil parish of Almondsbury, South Gloucestershire, England. It is situated at the bottom of a hill (known as &quot;Blackhorse Hill&quot;) near Junction 17 of the M5 Motorway on the B4055 road.

The village is only 1.5 miles away from &#x27;The Mall&#x27; shopping centre and leisure complex at Cribbs Causeway. There is a pub (The Fox), a post office (open Monday/Wednesday/Friday in the mornings and based in the village hall), Methodist chapel, bowling alley, and a playing field (including skate park). It is served by the church of Compton Greenfield, as well as the chapel in the village. The B4055 road leads to Pilning, Redwick and Severn Beach.

The National Cycle Network runs through the village on its way to the Severn Bridge by which it is possible to enter Wales on foot or bicycle. There are some walks locally which give great views of the surrounding countryside, especially from the top of Spaniorum Hill. Each year in June, the village holds a carnival. The main road through the village is closed and the carnival procession finishes on the playing field where the floats are judged and various entertainments and stalls are available. In 2006, due to insurance restrictions, the carnival, previously drawn by lorries and vans provided by a local haulage firm, was restricted to non-motorised transport and the traditional throwing of water and flour was forbidden. In recent times the carnival has been cancelled due to the pandemic.

The village also puts on a large fireworks display on 5 November to mark Guy Fawkes Night.

Bristol Zoo is planning to open a large zoological and adventure park in woodland which it owns adjacent to Blackhorse Hill.

The Wave Bristol, a park with a 200 metre long artificial wave pool for surfing opened near the village in 2019.

<doc id="742238" wikidata="Q1051665" url="?curid=742238" title="Metre per second squared">
<text>The metre per second squared is the unit of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI). As a derived unit, it is composed from the SI base units of length, the metre, and time, the second. Its symbol is written in several forms as m/s2, m·s−2 or ms−2, formula_1, or less commonly, as (m/s)/s.

As acceleration, the unit is interpreted physically as change in velocity or speed per time interval, i.e. metre per second per second and is treated as a vector quantity.

==Example==
When an object experiences a constant acceleration of one metre per second squared (1 m/s2) from a state of rest, it achieves the speed of 5 m/s after 5 seconds and 10 m/s after 10 seconds. The average acceleration &quot;a&quot; can be calculated by dividing the speed &quot;v&quot; (m/s) by the time &quot;t&quot; (s), so the average acceleration in the first example would be calculated: formula_2.

==Related units==
Newton&#x27;s second law states that force equals mass multiplied by acceleration.
The unit of force is the newton (N), and mass has the SI unit kilogram (kg). One newton equals one kilogram metre per second squared. Therefore, the unit metre per second squared is equivalent to newton per kilogram, N·kg−1, or N/kg.

Thus, the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field (near ground level) can be quoted as 9.8 metres per second squared, or the equivalent 9.8 N/kg.

Acceleration can be measured in ratios to gravity, such as g-force, and peak ground acceleration in earthquakes.

== Unicode character ==
The &quot;metre per second squared&quot; symbol is encoded by Unicode at code point . This is for compatibility with East Asian encodings and not intended to be used in new documents.

<text>Rockhampton is a village and civil parish in the English county of Gloucestershire, situated in the unitary district of South Gloucestershire. It is located northeast of Thornbury, north of Bristol and is approximately east of the River Severn. It had a population of 166 people according to the 2011 census.

The south end of the village is more properly called Newton, and is in the Thornbury postal area.

==Population==

The population of Rockhampton has only increased by six since the census started in 1801. However, there have been wide variations in population since 1801 until now. The first big variation was an increase of 61 people from 1821 to 1831 where the population reached 220. The population reached its highest point in 1951 when it reached 235. The next big variation was a decrease of 71 people from 1881 to 1891 where the population fell to 149.

This fall in population was due to Rockhampton civil parish losing the village of Shepperdine to the Thornbury 
civil parish. Since then until 1961 there was not a lot of variation in population. However, from 1961 there was a big increase of 52 people up to 2001 when the population reached 176.

In 2011, 63% of the population in Rockhampton was between 16 and 64 which means most of the population is working age, 85% of this age group was aged between 30 and 64. On the other hand, 23% of the population was 65 and over which means there is a small retired community in Rockhampton.

==History==
The Church of St Oswald was mostly built during the 14th century, but some parts were built as early as the 13th century. There are still traces of medieval paintings inside the church. In 1860–61 parts of the church were rebuilt by Kempson of Hereford and in 1960 it was listed as a grade II* English heritage building.
In the 1870s, Rockhampton was described as:
: &quot;A parish, with a village, in Thornbury district, Gloucester; 2 miles N N E of Thornbury, and 4¾ W by N of Charfield r. station.&quot;

During 1881 there was a clear occupational structure for the male population of Rockhampton, with more than 80% of males working in agriculture. However, it was very different for females as 60% were unemployed, but the area where the most females were employed in was domestic services or offices.

Rockhampton village hall, located next to the Church of St Oswald, was originally a village church school with 26 children attending in 1940. However, in the late 1940s the school was shut down, but after some fundraising it was purchased for the residents of Rockhampton in 1983.

==Economy==
Rockhampton has three small engineering repair works, five working farms, two tree nurseries and an equestrian centre. There are no general shops or pubs. This is similar to the businesses that would have been around in 1881.

Rockhampton is a wealthy rural commuter village and the parish has entrepreneurial people living there with 19% of the population being self-employed. Additionally, 17% of Rockhampton&#x27;s population is retired and only one person was unemployed according to the 2011 census data. Of the people who were employed in Rockhampton; 18 work in the health industry, 11 work in the retail industry and 10 work in the Professional, Scientific and Technical industry. These industries employed the most people from Rockhampton.

==Education==
There is no school in Rockhampton civil parish despite the village hall being a former church school. The closest primary school is Manorbrook Primary School (1.2 Miles) and the closest secondary school is The Castle School (1.4 Miles), both are in Thornbury. However, even though Rockhampton doesn&#x27;t have a school, the parish is well educated with 65 people having a degree or equivalent. Additionally only 10 people in Rockhampton have no qualifications.

==Sports and Leisure==
Rockhampton Cricket Club play in the West of England Premier League – Gloucestershire &amp; Wiltshire Division. This is the highest level they have played at, since being founded in 1872. They also reached the Davidstow Village Cup final at Lord&#x27;s in 2013. The cricket club is one of the village&#x27;s oldest institutions and was founded by Thomas Jenkins Ford. The village has two cricket grounds with the most recent being opened in 1999.

In 2015, Rockhampton&#x27;s 1 XI won the Glos/Wilts Division of the West of England Premier League. The same year, Rockhampton&#x27;s 3 XI won the first division of the Martin Berrill Stroud &amp; District Cricket League.

Thornbury RFC&#x27;s ground is located in Rockhampton and play in the South West 1 League.

==Housing==
There is a total of 64 households in Rockhampton according to the 2011 census; 82.8% are detached houses, 10.9% are semi-detached, 3.1% are part of a converted or shared house, 1.6% are purposed-built flats or tenement and 1.6% are terraced housing. Of the 64 households in Rockhampton, 29 were owned outright, 28 were owned with a mortgage, 5 were privately rented from a private landlord or Letting Agency, One had shared ownership and one was socially rented, according to data from the 2011 census. The most people living in one household in Rockhampton is six and the fewest people living in one household is one.

<text>Beyond Fear is an American heavy metal band started in March, 2005 by Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens after he left Judas Priest as a side-project, apart from his former work with Iced Earth.

==History==
The band was started largely to satisfy Owens&#x27; desire to be involved in the song writing on a heavy metal album, something denied to him on most of his previous musical ventures. Writing duties are split between Owens and guitarist John Comprix. A demo was recorded after a month, and the debut album was released about a year later. Later on the same year as their debut album was released guitarist Dwayne Bihary quit the band, with the reasons being kept private.

Owens commented on Beyond Fear&#x27;s next studio album in an interview with Metal Asylum: &quot;It will always be classic metal but I think a lot of the later songs that we recorded for the debut, like “Scream Machine”, became favorites for fans. And lyrics to a song like that were not so serious and more cliché metal lyrics, you know about a metal machine (laughs), so I think some of the new songs may go in that direction. We are still gonna have songs like “Save Me” but I think it will probably have some more aggression. We have been writing now, John Comprix and I, for a while, I have a lot of ideas and melodies in my head that I really can’t use anywhere else (laughs). Its nice I get to use em for Beyond Fear. I mean I have been a writer for many years but I don’t get to do it as much as I would like and Iced Earth just keeps me so busy but its nice that every once and [sic] a while I get to do my thing with Beyond Fear. And we get to take our time with this band and practice together. I mean that’s what I want to hear with all my influences on one album that’s what I like to do with Fear.&quot;

<text>CDex is a free software package for Digital Audio Extraction from Audio CD (a so-called CD ripper) and audio format conversion for Microsoft Windows. It converts CDDA tracks from a CD to standard computer sound files, such as WAV, MP3, or Ogg Vorbis. CDex was previously released as free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL); however, although the website claims that this is still the case, no source code has been released since 2005. It was originally written by Albert L. Faber, and is developed and maintained by Georgy Berdyshev. Recent versions of the software may be compromised and a security threat.

==Features==
CDex is able to convert CD audio into several formats including WAV, Vorbis, MP3 (using the LAME encoder), VQF, Musepack, APE, and many others. As of version 1.70b2 FLAC encoding is native, but for version 1.51 FLAC and other codecs can be used by using an external encoder. It supports CD-Text to allow ripped tracks, with reduced user effort, to have the names of songs, artists and albums. It can also automatically identify (most) inserted audio CDs and look up the metadata by means of an online database (freedb) for automatic tagging, naming and sorting of ripped files. It also includes cdparanoia for robust CD reading. CDex is considered to be very configurable and relatively easy to use.

==History==
In 2000, at the start of the beta phase for version 1.30, CDex was turned into a free software project (&quot;cdexos&quot;: &quot;CDex Open Source&quot;) and hosted on SourceForge.net.
In January 2006, the CDex homepage requested a new project manager and developer, implying that Albert L. Faber had abandoned development of CDex. On 5 June 2006, CDex 1.70 Beta 1 was released via the SourceForge.net website (ascribed to Georgy Berdyshev). It was the first official update to the program in almost three years, with CDex 1.70 Beta 2 following soon after on 23 June 2006. In 2008 Berdyshev was joined by Ariane Gomes as project developers. On 18 November 2009 CDex 1.70 Beta 4 was released. CDex 1.70 Final was released on 29 June 2014 featuring a Unicode and Multibyte version.

On 30 June 2007, just one day after the release of the GPLv3, the license of CDex was updated. However, the last version for which source code was made available is 1.70 Beta 2, and the SourceForge project appears to have been shut down in July 2015, shortly after the release of version 1.79.

From version 1.76 the installer includes the adware OpenCandy.

In November 2017 version 1.96 was released. It is not clear who is the current code maintainer, and no contact details are provided. Four further versions were released by March 2018.

The default Remote Server database in CDEx, Freedb, became inaccessible by June 2020. The gnudb.org site at location gnudb.gnudb.org (on HTTP port 80) using proxy.gnudb.org works as a replacement for the inactive default Remote Server database.

==Potential risks and adware controversy==
Online discussions over concerns relating to the safety and security of CDex have been ongoing since at least 2013 with many asserting that the software has become malware. Post-2013 reincarnations of CDex have seen a number of sponsored programs being automatically selected (or selected without any knowledge at all) during installation with little information about their nature. Scan results suggest there may be risks attached to installing them. 

Open source commentators have suggested that the current maintainer and software should not be trusted and even that CDex should be avoided outright. Support links are now broken and the ticketing system no longer exists. There are no contact details provided or any way to interact with the developer. The installer bundles adware without any notifications. Despite updates nominally being made to the application, some of these have involved bundling the installer with hidden adware. MalwareBytes has adopted the stance, as of 2019, that CDex contains potentially unwanted programs and thus flags the CDex package as malware. The rolling back of source code availability has prevented a proper audit and stymied any potential defence of CDex&#x27;s case. Further, anecdotal discussion has resulted in claims that versions of CDex from the latter half of the 2010s are adding artifacts to the ends of certain tracks ripped by the program.

<doc id="742263" wikidata="Q1028202" url="?curid=742263" title="San Salvador, Venice">
<text>The Chiesa di San Salvatore (of the Holy Savior) is a church in Venice, northern Italy. Known in Venetian as San Salvador, is located on the Campo San Salvador, along the Merceria, the main shopping street of Venice. The church was first consecrated in 1177 by Pope Alexander III shortly after his reconciliation with Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at nearby San Marco. The present church, however, was begun in around 1508 by Giorgio Spavento and continued after his death the following year by Tullio Lombardo, Vincenzo Scamozzi and possibly Jacopo Sansovino. They built a large hall church, formed from three Greek crosses placed end to end. Each has a dome with a lantern to let light into the cavernous interior. The facade was added in 1663 by Giuseppe Sardi.

Adjoining the church is the former monastery, now the offices of the telephone company, which still contain Sansovino&#x27;s magnificent cloisters.

San Salvador is the parish church of a parish in the Vicariate of San Marco-Castello. Other churches in the parish are San Bartolomeo and San Zulian.

San Salvador is a small, but still-active religious, cultural and social centre.

Below the left column on the facade there is a cannonball embedded in the base of the column. It derived from a bombardment in 1849 by Austrian forces in the port of Marghera, of the independent republic which had been proclaimed by Daniele Manin.

==Works of art==
* Jacopo Sansovino (tomb of Francesco Venier on the south wall).
* Titian (&quot;Annunciation&quot; on the south wall and &quot;Transfiguration&quot;, the altarpiece of the high altar).
* Francesco Vecellio (paintings on organ doors; frescoes in tomb in floor in front of high altar).
* Alessandro Vittoria (altar on north wall, with statues of St. Roch and St. Sebastian).
* Giulio Angolo del Moro Savior in Monument of Andrea Dolfin.

==Funerary monuments==
* Caterina Cornaro (d.1510) (Queen of Cyprus).
* Andrea Dolfin
* Doge Gerolamo Priuli
* Doge Lorenzo Priuli
* Doge Francesco Venier (d.1556).

<text>Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman&#x27;s Crusade for Free Software () is a free book licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License about the life of Richard Stallman, written by Sam Williams and published by O&#x27;Reilly Media on March 1, 2002.

Williams conducted several interviews with Stallman during the writing of the book, as well as with classmates, colleagues of Stallman, and his mother. The book has received positive reviews.

==Structure==
The book is divided into a preface, thirteen chapters, an epilogue, three appendices and an index. A copy of the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) is included as Appendix C.

==License==
&quot;Free as in Freedom&quot; was published under the GNU Free Documentation License version 1.1, which allows modification and redistribution of the text, photographs contained therein, as well as the cover: its texts, photograph and elements of design.

==Writing==
Williams has written an article about the process of writing &quot;FaiF&quot;, recording the license negotiations that led to this book being published under a free license. OnLamp also interviewed Williams in 2002 about the writing process.

==Reception==
Andrew Leonard in &quot;Salon&quot; complimented the amount of new information Williams reveals about Stallman, given the amount of material already published. He describes the book as a &quot;nuanced, detailed picture of Stallman&quot;. In &quot;Computer User&quot;, Jende Huang referred to the book as &quot;straightforward&quot; and wrote, &quot;the juxtaposition of Stallman&#x27;s public and private personae is the key to the book&#x27;s appeal.&quot; He summarized that the book is &quot;a worthwhile read for its chronicle of an important part of the free software movement, as well as its insight into Stallman as a person.&quot; In Italian &quot;VITA&quot;, Bernardo Parrella described its &quot;greatest merit&quot; to be its &quot;new perspective&quot; on the issues at stake for Free Software and the computer industry as a whole, and its interweaving of Stallman&#x27;s personal life and complex technical developments to be &quot;gripping&quot;. He noted that the book is an important &quot;real time&quot; biography, full of references to other books, publications and web links, about a man who is misunderstood, and underestimated. In a review for Sys-Con, Mike McCallister describes the book as an &quot;easy introduction to Stallman&#x27;s career and ideas, but at this length cannot go into great depth.&quot; He mentions one section as &quot;very funny&quot;, but &quot;all too-brief&quot; coverage of another topic, or none at all (GNOME).

==Free as in Freedom 2.0==
After reading &quot;Free as in Freedom&quot; in 2009, Richard Stallman made extensive revisions and annotations to the original text. As the book was published under the GFDL, it enabled Stallman to address factual errors and clarify some of the author&#x27;s mistaken or incoherent statements, bringing in his first-hand experiences and technical expertise where appropriate. This new revised edition &quot; Free as in Freedom 2.0&quot; was published by GNU Press in October 2010 and is available at FSF online shop and as a free PDF download. Sam Williams wrote a new foreword for the revised edition.

<doc id="742288" wikidata="Q181465" url="?curid=742288" title="Faraday's law of induction">
<text>Faraday&#x27;s law of induction (or simply Faraday&#x27;s law) is a law of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (emf). This phenomenon, known as electromagnetic induction, is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electric motors, generators and solenoids.

The Maxwell–Faraday equation (listed as one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations) describes the fact that a spatially varying (and also possibly time-varying, depending on how a magnetic field varies in time) electric field always accompanies a time-varying magnetic field, while Faraday&#x27;s law states that emf (electromagnetic work done on a unit charge when it has traveled one round of a conductive loop) appears on a conductive loop when the magnetic flux through the surface enclosed by the loop varies in time.

Once Faraday&#x27;s law had been discovered, one aspect of it (transformer emf) was formulated as the Maxwell–Faraday equation. The equation of Faraday&#x27;s law can be derived by the Maxwell–Faraday equation (describing transformer emf) and the Lorentz force (describing motional emf). The integral form of the Maxwell–Faraday equation describes only the transformer emf, while the equation of Faraday&#x27;s law describes both the transformer emf and the motional emf.

==History==
Electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by Michael Faraday in 1831 and Joseph Henry in 1832. Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments.
Faraday&#x27;s notebook on August 29, 1831 describes an experimental demonstration of electromagnetic induction (see figure) that wraps two wires around opposite sides of an iron ring (like a modern toroidal transformer). His assessment of newly-discovered properties of electromagnets suggested that when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. Indeed, a galvanometer&#x27;s needle measured a transient current (which he called a &quot;wave of electricity&quot;) on the right side&#x27;s wire when he connected &quot;or&quot; disconnected the left side&#x27;s wire to a battery. This induction was due to the change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. His notebook entry also noted that fewer wraps for the battery side resulted in a greater disturbance of the galvanometer&#x27;s needle.

Within two months, Faraday had found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead (&quot;Faraday&#x27;s disk&quot;).
Michael Faraday explained electromagnetic induction using a concept he called lines of force. However, scientists at the time widely rejected his theoretical ideas, mainly because they were not formulated mathematically. An exception was James Clerk Maxwell, who in 1861–62 used Faraday&#x27;s ideas as the basis of his quantitative electromagnetic theory. In Maxwell&#x27;s papers, the time-varying aspect of electromagnetic induction is expressed as a differential equation which Oliver Heaviside referred to as Faraday&#x27;s law even though it is different from the original version of Faraday&#x27;s law, and does not describe motional emf. Heaviside&#x27;s version (see Maxwell–Faraday equation below) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

Lenz&#x27;s law, formulated by Emil Lenz in 1834, describes &quot;flux through the circuit&quot;, and gives the direction of the induced emf and current resulting from electromagnetic induction (elaborated upon in the examples below).

According to Albert Einstein, much of the groundwork and discovery of his special relativity theory was presented by this law of induction by Faraday in 1834.
==Faraday&#x27;s law==

The most widespread version of Faraday&#x27;s law states:
===Mathematical statement===

For a loop of wire in a magnetic field, the magnetic flux is defined for any surface whose boundary is the given loop. Since the wire loop may be moving, we write for the surface. The magnetic flux is the surface integral:
formula_1
where is an element of area vector of the moving surface , is the magnetic field, and is a vector dot product representing the element of flux through . In more visual terms, the magnetic flux through the wire loop is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass through the loop.

When the flux changes—because changes, or because the wire loop is moved or deformed, or both—Faraday&#x27;s law of induction says that the wire loop acquires an emf, defined as the energy available from a unit charge that has traveled once around the wire loop. (Although some sources state the definition differently, this expression was chosen for compatibility with the equations of special relativity.) Equivalently, it is the voltage that would be measured by cutting the wire to create an open circuit, and attaching a voltmeter to the leads.

Faraday&#x27;s law states that the emf is also given by the rate of change of the magnetic flux:
formula_2
where formula_3 is the electromotive force (emf) and is the magnetic flux.

The direction of the electromotive force is given by Lenz&#x27;s law.

The laws of induction of electric currents in mathematical form were established by Franz Ernst Neumann in 1845.

Faraday&#x27;s law contains the information about the relationships between both the magnitudes and the directions of its variables. However, the relationships between the directions are not explicit; they are hidden in the mathematical formula.

It is possible to find out the direction of the electromotive force (emf) directly from Faraday’s law, without invoking Lenz&#x27;s law. A left hand rule helps doing that, as follows:
* Align the curved fingers of the left hand with the loop (yellow line).
* Stretch your thumb. The stretched thumb indicates the direction of (brown), the normal to the area enclosed by the loop.
* Find the sign of , the change in flux. Determine the initial and final fluxes (whose difference is ) with respect to the normal , as indicated by the stretched thumb.
* If the change in flux, , is positive, the curved fingers show the direction of the electromotive force (yellow arrowheads).
* If is negative, the direction of the electromotive force is opposite to the direction of the curved fingers (opposite to the yellow arrowheads).

For a tightly wound coil of wire, composed of identical turns, each with the same , Faraday&#x27;s law of induction states that
formula_4
where is the number of turns of wire and is the magnetic flux through a single loop.

===Maxwell–Faraday equation===

The Maxwell–Faraday equation states that a time-varying magnetic field always accompanies a spatially varying (also possibly time-varying), non-conservative electric field, and vice versa. The Maxwell–Faraday equation is

 {\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

(in SI units) where is the curl operator and again is the electric field and is the magnetic field. These fields can generally be functions of position and time .

The Maxwell–Faraday equation is one of the four Maxwell&#x27;s equations, and therefore plays a fundamental role in the theory of classical electromagnetism. It can also be written in an integral form by the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, thereby reproducing Faraday&#x27;s law:

{\partial t} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where, as indicated in the figure, is a surface bounded by the closed contour , is an infinitesimal vector element of the contour , and is an infinitesimal vector element of surface . Its direction is orthogonal to that surface patch, the magnitude is the area of an infinitesimal patch of surface.

Both and have a sign ambiguity; to get the correct sign, the right-hand rule is used, as explained in the article Kelvin–Stokes theorem. For a planar surface , a positive path element of curve is defined by the right-hand rule as one that points with the fingers of the right hand when the thumb points in the direction of the normal to the surface .

The line integral around is called circulation. A nonzero circulation of is different from the behavior of the electric field generated by static charges. A charge-generated -field can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field that is a solution to Poisson&#x27;s equation, and has a zero path integral. See gradient theorem.

The integral equation is true for &quot;any&quot; path through space, and any surface for which that path is a boundary.

If the surface is not changing in time, the equation can be rewritten:
formula_5
The surface integral at the right-hand side is the explicit expression for the magnetic flux through .

The electric vector field induced by a changing magnetic flux, the solenoidal component of the overall electric field, can be approximated in the non-relativistic limit by the volume integral equation
formula_6
where is the boundary (loop) of the surface , and is the velocity of a part of the boundary.

In the case of a conductive loop, emf (Electromotive Force) is the electromagnetic work done on a unit charge when it has traveled around the loop once, and this work is done by the Lorentz force. Therefore, emf is expressed as
formula_7
where formula_3 is emf and is the unit charge velocity.

In a macroscopic view, for charges on a segment of the loop, consists of two components in average; one is the velocity of the charge along the segment , and the other is the velocity of the segment (the loop is deformed or moved). does not contribute to the work done on the charge since the direction of is same to the direction of formula_9. Mathematically,
formula_10
since formula_11 is perpendicular to formula_9 as formula_13 and formula_9 are along the same direction. Now we can see that, for the conductive loop, emf is same to the time-derivative of the magnetic flux through the loop except for the sign on it. Therefore, we now reach the equation of Faraday&#x27;s law (for the conductive loop) as
formula_15
where formula_16. With breaking this integral, formula_17 is for the transformer emf (due to a time-varying magnetic field) and formula_18 is for the motional emf (due to the magnetic Lorentz force on charges by the motion or deformation of the loop in the magnetic field).

==Exceptions==
It is tempting to generalize Faraday&#x27;s law to state: &quot;If &#x27; is any arbitrary closed loop in space whatsoever, then the total time derivative of magnetic flux through &#x27; equals the emf around &quot;&quot;.&quot; This statement, however, is not always true and the reason is not just from the obvious reason that emf is undefined in empty space when no conductor is present. As noted in the previous section, Faraday&#x27;s law is not guaranteed to work unless the velocity of the abstract curve matches the actual velocity of the material conducting the electricity. The two examples illustrated below show that one often obtains incorrect results when the motion of is divorced from the motion of the material.

One can analyze examples like these by taking care that the path moves with the same velocity as the material. Alternatively, one can always correctly calculate the emf by combining Lorentz force law with the Maxwell–Faraday equation:
:formula_19
where &quot;it is very important to notice that (1) is the velocity of the conductor ... not the velocity of the path element and (2) in general, the partial derivative with respect to time cannot be moved outside the integral since the area is a function of time.&quot;

==Faraday&#x27;s law and relativity==
===Two phenomena===
Faraday&#x27;s law is a single equation describing two different phenomena: the &quot;motional emf&quot; generated by a magnetic force on a moving wire (see the Lorentz force), and the &quot;transformer emf&quot; generated by an electric force due to a changing magnetic field (described by the Maxwell–Faraday equation).

James Clerk Maxwell drew attention to this fact in his 1861 paper &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot;. In the latter half of Part II of that paper, Maxwell gives a separate physical explanation for each of the two phenomena.

A reference to these two aspects of electromagnetic induction is made in some modern textbooks. As Richard Feynman states:

=== Explanation based on four-dimensional formalism ===
In the general case, explanation of the &quot;motional emf&quot; appearance by action of the magnetic force on the charges in the moving wire or in the circuit changing its area is unsatisfactory. As a matter of fact, the charges in the wire or in the circuit could be completely absent, will then the electromagnetic induction effect disappear in this case? This situation is analyzed in the article, in which, when writing the integral equations of the electromagnetic field in a four-dimensional covariant form, in the Faraday’s law the total time derivative of the magnetic flux through the circuit appears instead of the partial time derivative. Thus, electromagnetic induction appears either when the magnetic field changes over time or when the area of the circuit changes. From the physical point of view, it is better to speak not about the induction emf, but about the induced electric field strength formula_20, that occurs in the circuit when the magnetic flux changes. In this case, the contribution to formula_21 from the change in the magnetic field is made through the term formula_22 , where formula_23 is the vector potential. If the circuit area is changing in case of the constant magnetic field, then some part of the circuit is inevitably moving, and the electric field formula_21 emerges in this part of the circuit in the comoving reference frame K’ as a result of the Lorentz transformation of the magnetic field formula_25, present in the stationary reference frame K, which passes through the circuit. The presence of the field formula_21 in K’ is considered as a result of the induction effect in the moving circuit, regardless of whether the charges are present in the circuit or not. In the conducting circuit, the field formula_21 causes motion of the charges. In the reference frame K, it looks like appearance of emf of the induction formula_28, the gradient of which in the form of formula_29, taken along the circuit, seems to generate the field formula_21.

===Einstein&#x27;s view===
Reflection on this apparent dichotomy was one of the principal paths that led Albert Einstein to develop special relativity:

<text>Otis Kaye (1885–1974) was an American artist during the early 20th century. He is noted especially for &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; paintings of U.S. currency.

==Life and work==
Otis Kaye carried on the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; tradition of William Harnett, John Frederick Peto, and John Haberle, and is esteemed particularly for his works which include U.S. currency. Kaye, however, in addition to oils, created etchings, watercolors, and pastels, some including currency but others on varied themes.

Born in Dresden, Germany in 1885, Kaye came to Neemah, Michigan with his parents when he was only three years old. In 1904 he moved to New York for a short time and there discovered his passion for art. Kaye and his mother moved to Germany where he studied engineering. He returned to the United States around 1914 and worked successfully as an engineer in the Midwest until the stock market crash of 1929. He began painting &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; oils in the tradition of the great 19th-century artists, William Harnett, Peto and Haberle. Many of these works include coins and bills. Because the United States enacted a ban on painting currency in 1909, Kaye did not sell his paintings but gave them as gifts to family members and close friends. He also created ink drawings of currency, and made etchings after Rembrandt, Whistler and Picasso, as well as other artists. He expanded on these prints with compositions of his own in ink and gouache.

Kaye created larger paintings which focused on diverse themes: the economy, in &quot;De Jia Vu&quot;; war, in &quot;Land of the Free&quot;; religion, in &quot;Joshua&#x27;s Horn&quot;; art, in &quot;Rembrandt, What&#x27;s Behind the Painting&quot;; and even baseball in &quot;What a Hit!&quot; In addition to money, Kaye&#x27;s works sometimes include pistols and musical instruments and almost always show puns and humor. Art historian Bruce Chambers wrote, &quot;we are now accustomed to identifying Otis Kaye by the ambitious scale, layered meanings, and impeccable craftmanship of his trompe l&#x27;oeil money paintings...&quot;

Kaye lived in Illinois until just before his death in 1974 when he returned to Germany. Kaye never exhibited or sold his paintings during his lifetime. Beginning in the 1980s his works were sold at galleries and auctions in New York and quickly moved into public and private collections. In 2002 Kaye&#x27;s prints were exhibited at the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington, DC. and published in &quot;Otis Kaye Trompe L&#x27;Oeil Master of Appropriation&quot; by Mary Anne Goley (2002).

Kaye&#x27;s paintings and prints have been included in museum shows of American art in the United States and recently in Florence, Italy. The definitive catalog of Kaye&#x27;s works, &quot;Otis Kaye: Money, Mystery and Mastery&quot; was published by New Britain Museum of American Art for an exhibition in 2015.

<doc id="742291" wikidata="Q268130" url="?curid=742291" title="Mòcheno language">
<text>Mòcheno (; ; ) is an Upper German variety spoken in three towns of the Bersntol (, ), in Trentino, northeastern Italy.

Mòcheno is closely related to Bavarian and is variously classified either as a Southern Bavarian variety or a separate language of its own. It has also been posited that it may be descended from Lombardic (with influence from nearby dialects). Mòcheno speakers reportedly partially understand Bavarian, Cimbrian, or Standard German. However, many essential differences in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation render it difficult for speakers of Standard German to understand. 

== Name ==
The name &quot;Mòcheni&quot; used by bilingual Italian- and Ladin-speaking neighbours to refer to the speakers of the language has been coined from the verb &quot;&quot; &quot;to make&quot;, often used to build compound predicates in the language.

== Geographic distribution ==
According to the census of 2001, the first in which data on native languages were recorded, Mòcheno was spoken by a majority in the following municipalities (numbers of members of the Mòcheno linguistic group): Fierozzo/Florutz/Vlarotz (423 people, 95.92%), Palù/Palai/Palae (184 people, 95.34%), Frassilongo/Gereut/Garait (340 people, 95.24%, including the village of Roveda/Eichleit/Oachlait). In other municipalities of Trentino 1,329 persons declared themselves members of the Mòcheno linguistic group, a total of 2,276 in Trentino. In the 2011 census, the total number of speakers in the Province decreased to 1,660.

== Status ==
Mòcheno is officially recognised in Trentino by provincial and national law. Starting in the 1990s, various laws and regulations have been passed by the Italian parliament and provincial assembly that put the Mòcheno language and culture under protection. A cultural institute was founded by decree, whose purpose is to safeguard and raise awareness of the language. School curricula were adapted in order to teach in Mòcheno, and Italian street signs are being changed to bilingual Mòcheno/Italian.

<doc id="742302" wikidata="Q286666" url="?curid=742302" title="Southgate tube station">
<text>Southgate is a London Underground station in Southgate. It is on the Piccadilly line between Arnos Grove and Oakwood stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 4.

==History==
Southgate station opened on 13 March 1933 with Oakwood on the second phase of the northern extension of the Piccadilly line from Finsbury Park to Cockfosters. Prior to the station&#x27;s opening, alternative names were suggested including &quot;Chase Side&quot; and &quot;Southgate Central&quot;. On opening, local residents were given a free return ticket to Piccadilly Circus.

On 19 June 2018, at around 19:00 BST there was an explosion at the entrance of the station, injuring five people.

On 16 July 2018, the tube station Southgate was renamed &quot;Gareth Southgate&quot; for two days in recognition of the efforts of the England football manager Gareth Southgate in leading the England team to fourth place in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, controversy soon followed after a video was posted to social media of a woman illegally tearing the sign down while laughing, prompting TfL to make a statement saying that she was not a member of the Tube Staff, nor had the authority to remove the sign.

==Architecture==
The station is built in the Art Deco/Streamline Moderne design style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass and is one of the best known of the many stations Charles Holden designed for London Underground. The station building is circular with a flat projecting concrete roof. Externally, the flat roof of the raised central section appears, impossibly, to be supported by nothing more than a horizontal band of windows that provide daylight to the ticket hall. The roof is actually supported, umbrella-like, from a central column within the ticket hall. The whole building is topped by an illuminated feature resembling a Tesla coil, designed to look as if it is taken from Frankenstein&#x27;s laboratory.

Like Arnos Grove, Oakwood and Cockfosters, Southgate is a listed building in this case at Grade II* (regraded from Grade II in 2009) and retains much of its original decoration. The two escalators have the original column lighting, while bronze panelling is in evidence throughout the station. However; the station is not without change: in the late 1990s, one of the three entrances was filled in to be used as a new ticket office, and due to the design of the automatic barriers, one of the two remaining entrances is exit only.

In 2008, the station was extensively renovated, with new tiling at platform level, a partial new floor in the main ticket hall, and improved signage throughout. The station won the London Regional category award at the 2008 National Railway Heritage Awards for the modernisation of a heritage station.

The original escalators were replaced in the late 1980s with the then standard London Transport design. The balustrade of the escalators was manufactured from bronze, rather than aluminium to maintain the 1930s period appearance of the station and to satisfy the requirements of English Heritage.

The preserved condition of the station&#x27;s original features, particularly the escalators, makes Southgate popular for filming scenes for period dramas.

==Location==
The station was developed as a bus/underground interchange and the main building sits on an island between Southgate Circus and Station Parade where a series of bus stops are located. A secondary building containing shops wraps around the other side of the parade.

The station is located on a hill and whereas the platforms at the stations on each side are on the surface those at Southgate are in a short section of tunnel. The tunnel portals are visible from the platforms when looking north, a unique occurrence for a deep-level London Underground station. As usual on the Piccadilly line, the platforms are labelled Westbound and Eastbound. However, the tunnels run more or less north-east to south-west at Southgate, so eastbound is north-eastbound and westbound is south-westbound.

In the early 1980s, moving picture advertising was tested in the tunnels south of the station. The pictures were of a child on a beach turning to face the camera.

Southgate is the northernmost station in tunnels on the London Underground network.

==Services==
==Connections==
London Buses routes 121, 125, 298, 299, 382, W6, W9, 616, 628, 688 and 699 and night route N91 serve the station.

<doc id="742312" wikidata="Q1269842" url="?curid=742312" title="Sweet Gwendoline">
<text>Sweet Gwendoline is the main female character in the works of bondage artist John Willie, first published as a serial, usually two pages at a time, in Robert Harrison&#x27;s mainstream girlie magazine &quot;Wink&quot; from June 1947 to February 1950 and later in several other magazines over the years.

In Willie&#x27;s drawings and comic books, Gwendoline appears as a rather naïve blonde damsel in distress with ample curves, who is unfortunate enough to find herself tied up in scene after scene. She is rescued and also repeatedly tied up (though for benevolent reasons) by Secret Agent U-89. The moustachioed villain &quot;Sir Dystic D&#x27;Arcy&quot; was based on Willie himself. Though it has been compared to &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;, Willie stated that he had not seen the film or even heard of it until much later in his career.

In Germany, the punk band Die Ärzte recorded the song &quot;Sweet, Sweet Gwendoline&quot; that introduced her to a large part of the population that otherwise had no contact to the BDSM subculture. German gothic rock band Umbra et Imago, famous amongst the fetish goth scene, also recorded a song entitled &quot;Sweet Gwendoline&quot;.

In 1984, the stories were loosely adapted in &quot;The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak&quot;, a film by Just Jaeckin starring Tawny Kitaen in the role of Gwendoline.

<text>Peyton Place is an American prime-time soap opera that aired on ABC in half-hour episodes from September 15, 1964, to June 2, 1969.

Loosely based upon the 1956 novel of the same name by Grace Metalious, the series was preceded by a 1957 film adaptation. A total of 514 episodes were broadcast, in black-and-white from 1964 to 1966 and in color from 1966 to 1969. The first color episode is episode #268. At the show&#x27;s peak, ABC ran three new episodes a week. The program was produced by 20th Century Fox Television. A number of guest stars appeared in the series for extended periods, among them Dan Duryea, Susan Oliver, Leslie Nielsen, Gena Rowlands, and Lee Grant (who won an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Drama for her role of tough-as-nails Stella Chernak). The series served as the springboard for such performers as Mia Farrow, Ryan O&#x27;Neal, Barbara Parkins, Christopher Connelly, David Canary, Mariette Hartley, and Lana Wood.

==History==
With &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, ABC hoped to bring the success of the British serial &quot;Coronation Street&quot; to America. Inspired by that serial, it was decided that it should be aired in prime time. Producer Paul Monash wanted to launch a revival of Grace Metalious&#x27; novel of the same name. He refused to acknowledge it as a soap opera, calling it a &#x27;high-class anthology drama&#x27;. An hour-long pilot was shot in 1962. Originally, the Cross family from the novel was included, but when Irna Phillips was contracted to change the pilot, she decided to scrap it. Various disagreements between the makers ensued, and the official pilot was not aired until September 15, 1964.

When the series premiered in late 1964, it marked the birth of the prime time American soap opera. The early stories were adapted from the 1956 book and 1957 film of the same name, although some principal character names, backstories and occupations were changed or simply eliminated. The time setting was changed from the early 1940s (of the novel and film) to the present day, and the town&#x27;s location, which had previously been unidentified, was established as being in the commonwealth of Massachusetts in the fourth episode. Some sensational plot lines from the novel (like incest) were replaced with less controversial themes (like teen pregnancy). The series, nevertheless, immediately was criticized for the sexual themes with which it dealt.

&quot;Peyton Place&quot; was an instant hit; especially in the early years, when it had a loyal following from fans around the world. Originally, it was aired twice a week, but because of its success, it was increased to three airings a week in June 1965. When Dorothy Malone was rushed into emergency surgery, the producers were faced with the dilemma of what to do with her character, Constance MacKenzie, who at that point was too deeply embroiled in the plot line to disappear without reason. Lola Albright was hired to take over the role and continued in the series until Malone returned.

The show&#x27;s downfall began in September 1966. Ratings dropped after Mia Farrow&#x27;s departure. Farrow never expected the show to become a success and immediately tried to get out of her contract when the show started its airing. On the urging of her then-husband Frank Sinatra, the producers decided to write her off the show in the summer of 1966. The character Rachel Welles, portrayed by Leigh Taylor-Young, was written into the show as her replacement. The addition of Taylor-Young&#x27;s character, however, was not successful in increasing the ratings. The show was cut back to two airings a week. By 1968, most of the original characters had been written out of the show, in many cases at their own request. Critics agreed the show had become &#x27;dated&#x27; and, because of the constant change in characters, confusing as well. The writers, already beginning work on what would be the final season, announced several new characters would be written into the show. They would deal with &#x27;electrifying subjects, the war, the draft, riots, music, God, and godlessness&#x27;. Although several well-known actors were added to the cast, including Ruby Dee, it was cancelled on June 2, 1969.

===Major changes between the 1956 novel and the series===
* The book is set in the years surrounding World War II. The series was set in the decade it was produced.
* The entire Cross family, an important family in the novel, does not appear in the television series.
* In the novel, Michael Kyros was a high school teacher and the school principal. In the television series, he becomes Michael Rossi (as indeed he does in the novel &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;) and serves as the town&#x27;s doctor.
* In the novel, Matthew Swain was the town&#x27;s doctor. In the television series, he serves as the editor of the local newspaper.
* In the novel Rodney Harrington and Norman Page are unrelated. In the television series, they are brothers, sons of Leslie Harrington.
* In the novel, Betty Anderson is more bad-natured than in the television series.
* In the novel, Constance runs a clothing store; in the television series, she operates a bookstore.

==Plots==
The series opens with a shot of a church&#x27;s steeple, and the words &quot;Peyton Place&quot; superimposed, with a tolling of church bells. Announcer Dick Tufeld announces &quot;This is the continuing story of &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.&quot; The scene changes to scenes of the town square, a rolling brook, and a panoramic view of Peyton Place. It dissolves to cast members, and then narration of previous episode events by Warner Anderson, who also played Matthew Swain. In 1966 the message was changed to &quot;In color, the continuing story of &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.&quot; Warner Anderson left the series after the first season, but continued as narrator to the series until the final episode.

===Season 1 (1964–1965)===
In the first episode, Dr. Michael Rossi (Ed Nelson) arrives from New York City to set up practice in town. Newspaper editor Matthew Swain (Warner Anderson) tells him people usually try to get away from towns like Peyton Place, not move to them. Matthew&#x27;s third cousin Allison MacKenzie (Mia Farrow), a close friend of classmate Norman Harrington (Christopher Connelly), has begun to fall in love with his older brother, Rodney (Ryan O&#x27;Neal); she is smitten as soon as they share their first kiss. At the end of the episode, Allison&#x27;s mother, Constance (Dorothy Malone), makes it clear she disapproves of her daughter&#x27;s newfound relationship with Rodney.

Rodney is startled to find his father, Leslie (Paul Langton), in a passionate embrace with his secretary, Julie Anderson (Kasey Rogers), the mother of Rodney&#x27;s girlfriend, Betty (Barbara Parkins). Both Leslie and Julie are in unhappy marriages, but Leslie can&#x27;t explain this to his son in the moment. Confused, Rodney tells Betty he cannot date her anymore and begins to see Allison instead. Betty, confused and hurt because he offered no reason for breaking up with her, discovers she is pregnant and tells Rodney. He agrees to marry her, and then, following a car accident, Betty miscarries their child, but she does not tell Rodney until after they are wed—though Dr. Rossi, his nurse Laura, and Betty&#x27;s parents knew the truth before the marriage. Dr. Rossi and Constance become closer, though she&#x27;s unnerved by his possible purchase of the Carson beachfront home because of Elizabeth Carson&#x27;s murder there.

Dr. Rossi also tangles with Dr. Morton (Kent Smith) over emergency surgery for Catherine Peyton Harrington (Mary Anderson), Rodney and Norman&#x27;s spoiled, sickly, manipulative mother, who suffers a potentially fatal perforated ulcer. Rossi can&#x27;t save Catherine&#x27;s life especially when Morton arrives and tries to obstruct him from performing emergency surgery. Betty decides to leave Peyton Place but runs into Allison at the bus depot and changes her mind about leaving. Morton threatens to destroy Rossi over Catherine&#x27;s death and uses the autopsy process to frame him out of his admitting and operating privileges—until Rossi discovers the pathologist, Dr. Bradford, made a critical error. Allison confesses to her mother that she still loves Rodney, and Betty confesses to Rodney that she miscarried in the auto accident, but after rejecting the idea at first both she and Rodney agree to annul the marriage. Catherine&#x27;s will includes a surprise codicil returning Leslie&#x27;s stock in the mill to her father. Pressured by Rossi&#x27;s relentless effort to clear himself, Bradford confesses he faked Catherine&#x27;s autopsy report to Morton, who informs Leslie of the truth. Learning of this, Rossi urges Morton not to leave Peyton Place or Doctor&#x27;s Hospital. Betty shows an interest in nursing and Rossi helps her find a job as a nurse&#x27;s aide at the hospital to begin. Betty&#x27;s disturbed father, George Anderson (Henry Beckman), whose frustrations and drinking have driven him to spousal abuse and finally a nervous breakdown, is hospitalized in a sanitarium.

Midway through the first season, another principal character arrives in Peyton Place. Elliot Carson (Tim O&#x27;Connor), Allison&#x27;s birth father, who had been imprisoned for 18 years after being convicted of murdering his wife, Elizabeth, though the actual culprit was Catherine Harrington. The truth about the crime begins to emerge after Elliot&#x27;s former brother-in-law Paul Hanley, now a college teacher whose students include Allison—and who originally testified against Elliot at the murder trial—discovers Elizabeth&#x27;s diary and gives it to Elliot. Elliot is also torn between wanting Allison to know he&#x27;s her real father and, at Constance&#x27;s urging, not wanting to hurt her with the knowledge. George Anderson is allowed his first home visit during his treatment period. Elliot tries to stop George shooting Leslie and is shot himself; Leslie vows to clear Elliot&#x27;s name after Elliot undergoes surgery—out of guilt, having hidden the truth about Elizabeth&#x27;s murder. After Leslie tells the Peyton family attorney (Patrick Whyte) that Catherine committed the murder, the reaction makes him realize that most people will believe that Leslie is the real murderer who is dragging his dead wife&#x27;s name through the mud, a suspicion that rears its head throughout the run of the show, especially when Catherine&#x27;s father, the show title town&#x27;s patriarch, becomes a dominant regular character long after initial references to him as a dying invalid. Elizabeth Carson&#x27;s affair and murder have been noted by scholars for setting up the town&#x27;s legacy of transgressive women. Meanwhile, no longer in charge of the Peyton Mill and disillusioned over his alienation from his sons now that they know who killed Elizabeth, Leslie leaves Peyton Place to travel abroad and sort out his life, while Norman struggles to accept the truth about his mother who doted on him.

With his name clear, Elliot eventually marries Constance, but their decision to reveal to Allison that he is her real father, and that her mother hid that fact from her to protect her from association with a convicted murderer, does not go over too well with a daughter who had a firmly established view of the fictionalized father she had been brought up to believe in. Meanwhile, Norman falls in love with working-class girl Rita Jacks (Patricia Morrow), whose mother, Ada (Evelyn Scott), owns the local tavern. They start a relationship, but both are constantly bothered by Rita&#x27;s aggressive ex-boyfriend Joe Chernak (Don Quine). Steven Cord (James Douglas) arrives in Peyton Place to work with the Peyton/Harrington attorney but slowly reveals an agenda of his own. Claire Morton (Mariette Hartley), the daughter of Dr. Morton and a successful physician in her own right, returns to Peyton Place to end her marriage to a successful but indifferent doctor (Leslie Nielsen) and shows more than a professional interest in Dr. Rossi. Norman and Rita&#x27;s graduation night is spoiled when Joe tries to assault Rita, who tries to keep it secret. Otherwise, while serving as a co-chaperone, Constance tells Rodney she&#x27;s changed her mind about him. Elliot is offered the editorship of the &quot;Peyton Place Clarion&quot; after Matt decides to retire and leave Peyton Place.

Rodney tries to defend Norman, promising to help Rita and get Joe to back off, and winds up in a fight with him on the wharf, during which Joe accidentally falls off the wharf, strikes his head and, after getting up and trying to come at Rodney again, drops forward and dies. All of this is witnessed by Kim Schuster (Kimberly Beck), the six-year-old deaf-mute daughter of David (William Smithers) and Doris (Gail Kobe). She did not want to move from New York City to Peyton Place and, as a result, starts to rebel against her mother. She only bonds with Allison, who serves as her babysitter. The Schusters&#x27; marriage is troubled as a result of Kim&#x27;s rebellion and David&#x27;s ambivalence about operating the Peyton Mill. Doris eventually discharges Allison and tries to bond with Kim belatedly, but the troubles between the Schusters only deepen—especially when they learn Kim ran off while Allison and Norman were with her at the library and saw the fight between Rodney and Joe.

===Season 2 (1965–1966)===
The first half of the second season focused on the Rodney Harrington murder trial and the concurrent struggle of Allison Mackenzie after she was injured in a hit-and-run accident and left in a coma.

Rodney is accused in the death of Joe Chernak, who refused to accept Rita&#x27;s dumping him and falling for Norman. District Attorney John Fowler (John Kerr), son of the former DA who retired heartsick over learning he got a wrongful conviction against Elliot, is also unaware his wife Marian (Joan Blackman), is the driver who struck Allison. Elliot and Steven suspect the younger Fowler wants to avenge his father via another Harrington, since Leslie&#x27;s original failure convicted Elliot. Against his family attorney&#x27;s advice, Rodney gives a statement to the police and the DA. Leslie returns to Peyton Place, and ultimately succeeds in getting Rodney bail. Only Allison truly believes in Rodney&#x27;s innocence before her accident, which happened after she visited Rodney in jail. Norman is haunted by his wish that Joe were dead because he abused Rita. The return of autocratic patriarch Martin Peyton (George Macready) fascinates and unnerves Peyton Place.

A changing Betty also believes in Rodney&#x27;s innocence: she answered Rodney&#x27;s original call for an ambulance after Joe fell. Leslie can&#x27;t convince Rodney to file for a change-of-venue, fearing his own past will prejudice a local jury. Joe&#x27;s sister Stella Chernak (Lee Grant), a biochemist, arrives home from California and wants Rodney behind bars though she knows he didn&#x27;t intend to kill Joe. Her father, Gus Chernak (Bruce Gordon), struggling to overcome alcohol, blames Leslie for his own failures -— Leslie demoted then tried to fire him for drunkenness —- and for his son&#x27;s death, hoping Rodney pays for Leslie&#x27;s sins. The Fowlers separate after Marian admits being tempted to an affair with physical therapist Russ Gehring (David Canary). Stella lies at the preliminary hearing, after Michael hires her to help launch his medical research lab. Suspiciously, she is reluctant to submit a complete personnel file. Rodney finally hires Steven as his sole defense attorney.

Stella alienates most of Peyton Place except Michael, with whom she becomes somewhat romantically involved. Rita and Kim have emotional problems over the case, Rita blaming herself but refusing her mother Ada&#x27;s urge to have them leave town before the trial begins. Betty steals Stella&#x27;s personnel file knowing Steven needs background help on Stella. To Betty&#x27;s surprise, stoic, hard-nosed Nurse Choate (Erin O&#x27;Brien-Moore) defends her though Michael demands her resignation.

Allison&#x27;s coma worries her parents and friends. Fowler subpoenas Rita, whom Steven wanted as a defense witness, but her emotional testimony exposes Joe&#x27;s seedy character. Norman stays by her side and they elope after she testifies. Doris Schuster takes Kim back to New York. Martin moves back into the mansion and David moves to the local inn where Leslie is already staying. Allison emerges from her coma slowly but with no memory of the entire past year. Rodney fears his grandfather is even more manipulative than his father. Betty rejects Leslie&#x27;s offer to help her find a new job. Stella is at increasing odds with her father over Joe&#x27;s memory and character. David Schuster subdues Gus after Gus destroys mill equipment, but Gus collapses. Michael determines he&#x27;s dying of cirrhosis of the liver. Gus dies after walking out of the hospital to confront Martin at the mansion. Stella perjures herself during the trial.

Michael advises Constance not to tell Allison about Elliot again just yet, which angers him. Russ keeps the secret of Marian Fowler hitting Allison after leaving his home. Steven&#x27;s West Coast detective unearths embarrassing information on Stella, including her theft of lab samples and pinning the rap on a former boyfriend, Richard Jensen (Don Gordon). Steven convinces David to bring Kim back to testify at the trial. The jury convicts Rodney. Steven brings Jensen to Peyton Place, where he sets Stella up in a drug theft from the hospital. This prompts Stella to confess to Michael and then, formally, to Fowler, that she lied about Rodney. Marian also confesses to her husband that she was the driver who hit Allison. Rodney&#x27;s conviction is overturned with Stella&#x27;s confession and he&#x27;s exonerated. Stella leaves Peyton Place quietly, pleasing almost everyone including Michael by this point.

Allison has now re-learned the truth of the previous year. At first she can&#x27;t deal with it and rebels against her past, even cutting her trademark long hair and denouncing her parents. Michael convinces her to stop acting selfishly and return home, where she gradually accepts her parents again. She also wants to marry Rodney no matter his financial standing, but Rodney wants to build his own equity first. Martin offers Leslie the mill if Rodney agrees to live in the mansion under Martin&#x27;s guidance. Rodney is outraged by the agreement but stays in the mansion until he buys the Shoreline Garage with his inheritance, needing to work and accomplish on his own without the Peyton/Harrington influence. Betty and Steven marry at the mansion and honeymoon before moving into the home Hannah bought for them.

The second half focuses mostly on a childhood accident involving Chris Webber (Gary Haynes) seventeen years earlier. He fell from a Sailors&#x27; Bluff cliff and was blinded in the accident; young Ann Colby was accused of pushing him. Returning to Peyton Place as an adult under her former married name, Ann Howard (Susan Oliver) wants to prove her innocence. Chris&#x27; tough brother, Lee (Stephen Oliver), accused Ann, who left town with her father following the accident. Lee now tries to bully her out of town. His wife, Sandy (Lana Wood), suffering under his abusive personality, is pushed toward Rodney, for whom Lee works at the garage and about whom Lee was suspicious before meeting Sandy. Ann also befriends Allison and becomes romantically involved with Michael. Chris arrives to visit, surprising his brother and sister-in-law who expected to drive to Boston to bring him back. Allison continues struggling with her identity after her breakup with Rodney. Leslie&#x27;s bargain with Martin has severe consequences for Rodney&#x27;s relationship with Norman.

Hannah Cord (Ruth Warrick), Martin&#x27;s housekeper/assistant, wants to make Ann leave town as well. Only Betty is unafraid to challenge Martin. He admires that quality in her and hires her as his second assistant. Hannah, meanwhile, carries a dark secret about son Steven&#x27;s past. Steven remains suspicious of Betty&#x27;s feelings for Rodney despite the fact Rodney and Betty were annulled long before he met Betty. After it is established that Steven has spent much of his life living in the Peyton Manor with his &quot;mother&quot;, Hannah, and the Peyton-Harringtons, Betty and the Harringtons expect that Martin will reveal he&#x27;s Steven&#x27;s father. Steven tells Betty he himself doen’t know; he&#x27;s always been waiting for someone to tell him. Even though Hannah and Martin obviously know of Steven&#x27;s expectation to be told of his apparent Peyton and Cord lineage, they allowed him to believe the falsehood.

In time, it is revealed Steven and Ann are twins, the illegitimate children of Brian Cord and Catherine Peyton, who bore them out of wedlock. Rodney discovers the truth by accident when he overhears Martin and Hannah. Ann was sent away with her father, Brian, while Hannah adopted Steven as a punishment to her ex-husband Brian. Only Martin and Hannah know the truth before Betty learns it from Rodney. Martin and Hannah tell Betty the truth will destroy Steven. Her effort to keep silent at first causes Steven to think she&#x27;s seeing Rodney secretly. The Cords separate until Steven learns Ann really is his twin. Betty&#x27;s mother Julie reveals she rejected Leslie&#x27;s marriage proposal and plans to reconcile with her recovering husband, George, away from Peyton Place. Steven and Ann face it together and begin reconciling when Ann dies in an accident off the same bluff where Chris fell and was blinded.

Allison discovers Ann first and calls Elliot, who calls police. In a concurrent confrontation, Lee admits pushing Ann off the bluff to his brother Chris and becomes the main suspect in Ann&#x27;s death, though Martin and Leslie each suspect Hannah is involved somehow. With Rodney having proposed to Allison only a few hours before, a proposal she rejected, an angry Chris tells her that she is incapable of loving anyone—even Rodney—which strikes a nerve making her realize his statement is true. Allison suffers a breakdown and is hospitalized, but walks out of the hospital, alarming her parents, Michael, and Rodney, among others. The townspeople start to look for Allison but without any luck. Lee is arrested for Ann&#x27;s murder. He asks a judge to appoint Steven as his attorney. Steven first rejects then reluctantly agrees to the idea, after he begins questioning whether Ann&#x27;s past drove her to suicide. Chris turns his back on Lee and becomes outraged when he finds out about Steven defending him. Chris tries to convince Steven to withdraw from the case and also tries to push Sandy—abused by her husband yet still trying to love him—to stop protecting Lee. Michael finds Allison near Sailor&#x27;s Bluff and returns her to the hospital.

Michael is astonished that Steven will defend Lee, while Steven tries to keep Lee on what he calls a &quot;nice and short&quot; leash after getting him bail. Betty thinks Steven&#x27;s defending Lee out of a desire for vengeance against Martin and Hannah. Steven admits to her he thinks they killed Ann somehow. Allison leaves the hospital again. After taunting Rodney at the garage, Lee taunts Allison into leaving Peyton Place, unaware she&#x27;s already given up on her hometown where all her previous beliefs were shattered. After looking at Rodney through the garage window one last time, Allison walks slowly down the road out of town to a variation on the show&#x27;s main title music. (This reflected Mia Farrow leaving the show to accommodate the desire of her then-husband, Frank Sinatra). The townspeople are stunned by Allison&#x27;s disappearance, but Constance and Elliot are especially stunned. Friends try to keep Constance occupied while Elliot suspects Lee is responsible for Allison&#x27;s disappearance. So does DA Fowler, who revokes Lee&#x27;s bail when he learns Lee confronted Allison directly before she left, violating his bail conditions.

(Note: Lola Albright fills in for Dorothy Malone as Constance for several episodes.)

===Season 3 (1966–1967)===
The first season in color, Season Three focuses on three things: Constance and Elliot and their newborn son; the preliminary hearing for Lee Webber; and the arrival and troubles of young Rachel Welles (Leigh Taylor-Young).

The season begins with Connie going into premature labor and giving birth to the son she names Matthew [gift from God]. Rita is happy for the Carsons but desires her own baby, but Norman says if she does he&#x27;ll have to drop out of college to work full-time. Rita abandons the idea and works as Matthew&#x27;s babysitter as a second job. Baby Matthew is a hit with the townspeople, especially over-doting grandfather Eli. Connie and Elliot balance being doting parents to their new son with continuing concern over Allison&#x27;s disappearance.

Steven takes heat for serving as Lee&#x27;s reluctant defense attorney. The hearing&#x27;s early highlights include troubling testimony and new doubts from Michael over his fiancée Ann&#x27;s death. Ground down by Lee&#x27;s abuse, his estranged wife Sandy shows interest in Rodney. Blind brother Chris testifies against Lee, convinced Lee is guilty. Both John and Steven try to outsmart each other—directly as well as in court. Norman and Rita are shocked to find Rachel hiding in an old abandoned cabin—in possession of a bracelet Elliot once gave Allison as a gift. Hannah first tries to slip out of Peyton Place but returns and tries to distance herself from Martin. Betty is aghast when she determines Steven intends to grill his mother on the witness stand if need be. The hearing draws a lot of townspeople&#x27;s attention, largely because of Hannah&#x27;s and Martin Peyton&#x27;s scheduled testimonies.

Steven rebukes Hannah&#x27;s reconciliation attempt. His hard interrogation provokes Hannah&#x27;s confession that Catherine Peyton&#x27;s affair with her husband Brian Cord produced both Steven and Ann, and that Martin tried to hide the scandal by hiring Hannah and letting her claim Steven as her son, while Ann was sent to live with Brian, whom Martin paid off to keep quiet. Staggered over the news of his real lineage, Steven denounces Hannah. Hannah also testifies she saw Lee push Ann off the cliff, provoking Lee to explode that he didn&#x27;t push her. Hannah&#x27;s revelation staggers the Harrington men, too, with Norman leaving the courtroom mixed in rage and sorrow. Leslie refuses Martin&#x27;s apology and confession of his failure at Catherine&#x27;s graveside. Rodney tells Leslie he won&#x27;t be a pawn in any more of his father&#x27;s or his grandfather&#x27;s &quot;bargains.&quot; A lack of concrete evidence and Steven&#x27;s apparent use of the case to settle family scores gets Lee released on a technicality.

Lee returns home happy but he&#x27;s not welcomed home, and his claim of vindication is denounced because he wasn&#x27;t technically proven innocent. Chris steals Ada Jacks&#x27;s gun, planning to shoot Lee whom he believes a murderer. Lee tricks Steven into going to the Webber house where Chris tries to shoot him thinking he&#x27;s Lee. The bullet grazes Steven&#x27;s topcoat. Steven helps Sandy cover for Chris and send him away from Peyton Place to start his life over. In a heated argument with Lee, Steven promises to make him pay for killing Ann. Sandy files for divorce and pursues Rodney, who still needs to learn the truth about Allison until Connie convinces him lovingly to go on with his life.

Rachel turns out a runaway who reacts violently to anyone trying to get to know her at first. Having Allison&#x27;s bracelet makes Elliott think she knows more about Allison&#x27;s fate. Rodney gets Rachel to say she found the bracelet on a road. But only Michael is able to get truly close to her, discovering her uncle Jack Chandler (John Kellogg) abused her, and trying to protect her from him. Jack tries to make her return with him, which frightens her. She threatens to tell everyone that she found Allison&#x27;s bracelet in the floor of his truck if he keeps on harassing her, after which he gives up his legal claim to her custody—but he threatens to harm the Carsons and their newborn son if Rachel ever reveals the truth.

Michael takes a break from Peyton Place. Elliot suspects he&#x27;s seen Chandler in the past but can&#x27;t remember where. After initial reluctance, Rachel moves into the Carson home after Rodney urges her to accept people&#x27;s generosity. She&#x27;s overjoyed when Michael returns and gives her a puppy as a gift but discouraged when Michael offers only friendship. She soon notices Elliot and Constance quarrel a lot about her. Fearing she might break up their marriage, she leaves the house and tries to end all confusion by trying to prove Chandler was responsible for Allison&#x27;s disappearance. This leads her to his old farmhouse, where she is attacked by him. She is able to run away and returns to Peyton Place in tears. Elliot comforts her and finally admits that he wants to take care of her, even if she does not reveal any information on Allison.

An unexpected period of peace ends when Rachel is again harassed by Chandler, who sells his farm and moves to Peyton Place, where he strong-arms Leslie into hiring him at the mill and continues harassing Rachel. Elliot seems to get closer to the truth about Chandler. After the preliminary hearing, Martin accuses Steven of leaving the grown-ups to clean up &quot;his&quot; mess yet again. Steven and Betty find the Peyton mansion ablaze, compelling Steven to rescue Martin. Departing Hannah started the fire by torching the oil portrait of Catherine. After hospitalized Martin asks Steven his &quot;price&quot; for saving him, Steven names it—and moves into the mansion with Betty, ostensibly to keep his enemy close. Martin does the same with Lee, whom he hires as his chauffeur, hoping to make him pay eventually for killing Ann. Leslie, meanwhile, is unamused with Steven seeming to have become Peyton&#x27;s favorite son; Steven, concurrently, is uneasy about Martin trying to maneuver him into a political future. Rodney and Sandy enjoy dates but when Lee tries to strong-arm Sandy physically into returning to her marriage, Rodney surprisingly knocks Lee down with a punch.

Fearing that Martin has now disinherited Rodney and Norman, Leslie blackmails Betty into stealing Martin&#x27;s will, threatening to reveal a report which falsely claims Betty was dating several men while in New York. Betty is shocked when she reads the changed will—naming her the Peyton heir on condition she marries Rodney within a year of Martin&#x27;s death. Martin hopes to maneuver Betty and Steven&#x27;s breakup and Betty&#x27;s remarriage to Rodney, but Rodney is aghast at the maneuvers and rejects Betty&#x27;s apparent buying in to the Peyton image. Elliot discovers the odd belt buckle once belonging to Chandler that Rachel has carried was made in a Texas prison, and eventually that Chandler—real name Jack Forrest—served time for deadly assault. Elliot and Chandler get into a fiery argument that ends in violence and Elliot&#x27;s jailing and Chandler&#x27;s hospitalization. Elliot is free on bail and Steven as his attorney ramps up investigations into Chandler&#x27;s past. In the hospital, Chandler vows harm to the Carsons for challenging him and sheltering Rachel. But Chandler subsequently leaves Peyton Place, enraging Steven and Elliot because Chandler never received justice for his crimes against Rachel and others.

Meanwhile, Steven receives the detective report about Betty for his birthday party, investigates it himself, and tells a stunned party he received it from an anonymous coward—though he later confronts Martin and accuses the old man of sending it. Genuinely shocked over learning the conditions in Martin&#x27;s changed will, Rodney urges suspicious Steven not to believe the detective report&#x27;s lies. The truth about Leslie blackmailing Betty eventually comes out, and Leslie is denounced, while Betty is forgiven. Chandler returns and Lee reluctantly invites him to stay at his house. Rodney and Sandy break up and Martin offers Sandy money to leave town. Sandy spurns the money but leaves for California, and Lee accuses Martin of driving her out of town. Despite continuing to struggle with his feelings about his family heritage and his father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s manipulations, Rodney tries to convince Norman to accept financial help from his grandfather.

Posing as Elliot, now-returned Chandler picks Rachel up at night school, kidnaps her, and forces her away, where we learn Rachel accidentally killed her aunt Lucy, which Allison witnessed, and refused to speak of Allison because it meant admitting involuntary manslaughter. Chandler also tries to pin the death of Rachel&#x27;s parents in a fire on her. Rachel kidnaps baby Matthew after she&#x27;s released from the hospital following her own fresh escape from Chandler. Meanwhile, Chandler is arrested by the police and Rachel leaves Matthew at the hospital. Rachel escapes but loses her mind, thinking she&#x27;s Allison. Michael finally decides to send her to a clinic in Boston. Connie now wants every trace of Allison and Rachel both out of her house. Leslie continues his criminal actions by slipping a gun to Chandler to help Chandler escape jail. Norman sees it and blackmails his father into giving him a job, so he can support Rita, who now is pregnant.

At the end of the season, the town is stirred by the arrival of Adrienne Van Leyden (Gena Rowlands) and Eddie Jacks (Dan Duryea). Adrienne is a widow hired by Martin to break up Steven&#x27;s and Betty&#x27;s already unstable marriage. Adrienne seduces Steven into an affair. Michael suspects Adrienne caused her husband&#x27;s death. Meanwhile, Ada is unamused by the arrival of her estranged husband Eddie, who left her 19 years ago and who once considered Chandler a friend. He insists on getting back in touch with his daughter, and Rita is shocked when she meets him.

===Season 4 (1967–1968)===
The primary focus of season four remains Adrienne Van Leyden and Eddie Jacks and the havoc they provoke, until the arrival of young mother Jill Smith and a crisis she provokes for Constance and Elliot Carson, Michael Rossi, and Rev. Tom Winter and his wife, but the season ends with the immediate aftermath of Rodney Harrington&#x27;s injury in a motorcycle accident.

Adrienne has mixed feelings at first about Martin&#x27;s manipulations between her and Steven, even as Martin buys her an engagement ring and proclaims their engagement. Steven strains to relieve Betty&#x27;s suspicions about Adrienne&#x27;s interest in him, but Adrienne seems to fall in love with Steven. Steven has mixed feelings about Adrienne but gives in to her temptations. Meanwhile, shocking facts about her past come to light, particularly her having driven her husband—a highly respected medical researcher under whom Michael once studied—to suicide, when he found himself too ground down to resist the pressure of her demands after he sacrificed his career for her.

Betty follows Steven and Adrienne to Martin&#x27;s Boston home and confirms her suspicions. Returning home, she leaves Steven and stays at the Colonial Inn. Rodney, to whom Betty now turns for comfort, can&#x27;t convince Norman his interest in her is friendship alone. Adrienne visits Betty at the inn but Betty rebuffs her and tells Rod she plans to hire an out-of-town attorney to handle her divorce. Steven confronts Martin and Adrienne about their maneuvers, then storms to the Shoreline Garage and awakens Rod, accusing him of being in on the plot. When Steven accuses Rod of being in on the plot, he angrily turns Rod&#x27;s bed over with Rod still in it, and Rod knocks him down with a punch.

Adrienne tells Martin she plans to leave Peyton Place. Eddie tries to tell Steven about Adrienne&#x27;s scandalous past and Martin about Steven&#x27;s plan to have the old man declared incompetent. Ada wants Eddie to stay away from Rita, who wants to learn more about her father after initial reluctance. Norman and Martin each suspect Eddie intends to profit off Rita&#x27;s marriage into a wealthy family. As the Cords head toward divorce, Betty and Rod become reluctantly closer. Leslie won&#x27;t hire Eddie but their secret meetings have Elliot thinking Eddie is connected somehow to Jack Chandler, whom we learned was killed in a confrontation with out-of-town police. Ada reluctantly hires Eddie at the tavern, on Elliot&#x27;s persuasion. Norman suffers rib injuries when Eddie punches and shoves him during an argument. Betty confronts Adrienne again, this time at the Peyton mansion, the night before Adrienne&#x27;s wedding to Martin, but Adrienne falls down the long stairs after turning away from Betty and dies when she hits the bottom.

Sneaking into the mansion under a contract from Leslie to kill Martin, Eddie instead finds Adrienne&#x27;s dead body. Lee calls police accusing Eddie of killing her, and Eddie is jailed. Rita sees him being taken to the jail and staggers running after him, forcing her hospitalization. Steven agrees to defend Eddie reluctantly, hoping to learn the truth—but he learns Betty was the dark-haired girl Eddie saw run from the mansion. Rita forces her husband and mother to tell the truth about Eddie&#x27;s arrest. For reasons she can barely explain, Connie takes Adrienne&#x27;s death particularly hard, puzzling Elliot.

Martin visits Eddie in jail and learns Leslie contracted Eddie to kill him. He agrees to pay $50,000 for the signed document, and Eddie insists the money go to Norman and Rita. Martin convinces Lee to kill Leslie in revenge, hoping Leslie and Lee kill each other. Leslie shoots Lee as an intruder at his office. Severely wounded, Lee returns to the mansion crying out against Martin&#x27;s betrayal, revealing the abusive childhood that turned Lee into an abusive, at-war-with-the-world young man. Steven stops Lee from shooting Martin but the gun discharges during their struggle and kills Lee. Steven knows it discharged accidentally, though Martin suggests he avenged his sister&#x27;s death. Steven also tries to force Betty into acting like his loving wife by threatening to investigate her in Adrienne&#x27;s death, but he admits Adrienne&#x27;s death was an accident.

Martin decides to leave Peyton Place for his health&#x27;s sake. Eddie decides to leave, too, but Rita collapses when she learns of this. Two surgeries reveal she miscarried. Steven and Betty have a violent argument during which Steven strikes her several times; her bruises enrage Rod, who confronts Steven about it. Jill Smith (Joyce Jillson) comes to town with an infant she claims is Allison Mackenzie&#x27;s child, provoking battles between the Carsons—to whom Jill gives the baby for care—and Rod, who thinks he may be the baby&#x27;s father, but who was unaware Allison might have been pregnant when she left Peyton Place after rejecting his marriage proposal. Joe Rossi (Michael Christian), Michael&#x27;s shady brother, arrives in town hoping Michael will help him get one more chance to fix his life—but Joe turns out to have his own agenda, which Michael sees when Joe sees Jill in the square and freezes a moment at the sight of her. Jill has the same reaction.

Depressed Rita thinks Joe resembles her late, abusive ex-boyfriend Joe Chernak. Rita contacts Reverend Tom Winter (Robert Hogan), unhappily married to alcoholic wife Susan (Diana Hyland), who also serves as emotional support for rebellious teenager Carolyn Russell (Elizabeth Walker). Steven, who&#x27;s become Jill&#x27;s attorney, has ulterior motives for wanting to resolve the issue of the baby&#x27;s paternity—a way to strike back at still confused Rod. Betty tells Rod she&#x27;ll help care for the baby if she&#x27;s his but can&#x27;t love her because she&#x27;s Allison&#x27;s. Jill is really scheming with Joe, who hit town following criminal activities gone wrong, trying to avoid his old New York gang. Joe finds Rita, who&#x27;s been missing an entire day, and tries to convince her he&#x27;s not Chernak. This sets off a chain reaction of events from Eddie attacking Joe thinking he&#x27;s Chernak attacking Rita to the revelation that the baby is really Jill&#x27;s—in New York, she learned enough about Allison to pose as Allison and thus show Allison as the baby&#x27;s mother. Joe knows and reveals that means he&#x27;s the baby&#x27;s father.

The revelation stuns Michael and outrages the Carsons, and Elliot accuses Michael of deceiving the Carsons. Eddie finally leaves Peyton Place, convinced at last that his presence hurts more than helps Rita. Connie—who never stopped hoping, albeit quietly, that daughter Allison might yet return somehow—suffers a breakdown. Rita tells Ada she no longer fears her past. Elliot persuades Connie they should leave Peyton Place with baby son Matthew and start over fresh. Michael and Elliot reconcile before the Carsons leave. Neither Rod, Betty, Michael, nor Eli can persuade them to change their minds. Steven discovers uncomfortably that Susan has more than a casual legal interest in him. Tom&#x27;s marital problems cause him to doubt his worth as a minister, even as he hires Jill as a temporary secretary at Susan&#x27;s persuasion. 
Leslie is staggered when the son of Martin&#x27;s Boston attorney arrives with the news that Peyton Mills has been sold and Leslie is out, news that surprises his sons when he tells them over dinner. Susan encourages Tom to take Jill under his wing—hoping her youth and beauty will entice him out of the ministry to spend more time with his wife. Betty&#x27;s mother Julie returns for the wedding, but Betty refuses to let her mother drag the past back into her present and future. Uninvited Steven attends Rod and Betty&#x27;s wedding ceremony anyway and hands them an unexpected gift, which he got from his grandfather by way of a surprise and uncomfortable one-time meeting with Hannah—then vows to Susan that he&#x27;ll stop at nothing to break them up. Carolyn can&#x27;t deal with divorcing parents Marsha (Barbara Rush) and Fred (Joe Maross), acting out by flirting with Joe and dating a band musician, behavior that escalates as Marsha begins dating Michael.

The newly remarried Harringtons enjoy a brief honeymoon and begin putting their new house into shape. Ada gives Rita and Norman Eddie&#x27;s parting gift—the $50,000 Eddie got from Martin, which Eddie insisted be made out to Rita and Norman. Norman persuades reluctant Rod to take him as a garage partner converting it to motorcycle repair and sale. Steven discovers the promissory note Eddie sold to Martin and steals it from Martin&#x27;s lawyers. Fred tells Marsha and Carolyn he&#x27;s being transferred out of town, allowing them to make new lives, but Carolyn can&#x27;t accept it at first. Jill fears her presence in the Winter home may compromise the Winters&#x27; marriage, but Tom reminds her she may lose custody of baby Kelly if she leaves. Carolyn finally accepts her parents&#x27; divorce and uses it to date whom she pleases. Tom thinks Susan is plotting to break up their marriage by setting him up to be seduced by Jill. Steven confronts Ada with the stolen promissory note but Ada won&#x27;t help him find its truth.

Norman has persuaded Rod to hire Steven to handle the new motorcycle shop&#x27;s legal affairs, but Steven still hopes to break up Rod and Betty. After selling a bike to a student, Rod and Norman ride another bike back to the shop but they&#x27;re inadvertently run off the road by Steven—with Betty in his car—and Rod is seriously injured when he&#x27;s thrown into a tree. When Rod tells Michael at the hospital he can&#x27;t feel anything, Michael brings him to critical neck surgery and Rod begins a long, painful recovery from his paralysis. Steven&#x27;s attempt to comfort Betty is rebuffed angrily when she demands he stay out of their lives once and for all. Uninjured Norman is pounded with guilt over his brother&#x27;s condition. Tom defends Jill against Susan&#x27;s accusations. Neurosurgeon Harry Miles fears Michael is delaying further surgery on Rod. Leslie returns to town and accuses Steven of causing Rod&#x27;s accident deliberately.

Tom admits to Michael that Susan is an alcoholic and Michael recommends a sanitarium. Jill finally leaves the Winters home, and Tom blames Susan. Betty, Norman, and Rita struggle to hide emotions when visiting Rod. Tom searches for Jill unaware she&#x27;s staying secretly at Ada&#x27;s, but he eventually finds her and tells her she and he were meant to be together. Leslie leaves town again, but not before telling Betty he doesn&#x27;t approve of her remarrying Rod. Rod begins regaining some feeling but is aware his full recovery isn&#x27;t guaranteed. Jill rejects Tom and he tries to leave the ministry, but Jill flees when a social worker tries to take Kelly. Susan is hospitalized after a drunken rage. Rod orders Steven to leave after Steven offers help and asks forgiveness. Tom leaves the ministry and moves out, getting a lobster trapping job and moving into a fishing boat on the wharf. Jill reluctantly surrenders Kelly to child welfare authorities who give her to Norman and Rita temporarily, after Steven tries but fails to convince Judge Chester Jill was a victim of Susan&#x27;s plot. Rita offers to help Jill regain custody of Kelly. Tom&#x27;s church overseer refuses to let him leave the ministry.

(During this season, Wilfrid Hyde-White plays Martin Peyton during a brief absence by George Macready.)

===Season 5 (1968–1969)===
Ed Nelson remains the show&#x27;s lead actor following Dorothy Malone&#x27;s departure near the end of Season Four; Elizabeth Walker (Carolyn) and Barbara Rush (Marsha) are added to the opening credits. The final season revolves largely around Michael Rossi and Marsha Russell, but also around Rodney Harrington&#x27;s painful try at recovering from paralysis, Jill and Joe, and African-American neurosurgeon Harry Miles (Percy Rodriguez) who is hit with an unexpected family crisis involving his young son.

Michael offers Jill a nursing job while Carolyn becomes more serious with young bandleader Jeff. Joe objects to Norman and Rita having custody of baby Kelly. Rod isn&#x27;t comfortable with his therapist. Tom plans to divorce Susan. Norman is concerned about Betty turning to Steven for comfort as Rod&#x27;s recovery continues painfully. Carolyn learns a truth about her parents&#x27; marriage the hard way, when she discovers father Fred is dating a much younger woman, Donna. Betty criticizes Norman for not trusting her. Tom walks out of the ministry and goes to work on a fishing boat. Marsha admits to Carolyn she knew about Fred and Donna before she divorced Fred, but Carolyn blames her mother for the affair. Susan threatens to claim Tom and Jill had an affair if Tom tries divorcing her. Judge Chester reveals Jill leaving the Winter home wasn&#x27;t the reason he awarded custody of Kelly to Norman and Rita.

Rod fears Betty no longer wants to be with him. Michael persuades reluctant Jill to take a job as a nurse&#x27;s aide in training to become a full nurse. Fred admits to Carolyn his affair began after the day he feared he no longer loved Marsha. Susan threatens to ruin Tom unless he takes her back. Joe can&#x27;t admit he still has feelings for Jill—even as he accuses Tom falsely of hiding her and beats him viciously. Marsha tries to convince Carolyn her father is the reason for the divorce. Betty goes to work at the Harrington brothers&#x27; motorcycle shop. Harry tries to convince Rod to find his will to use his slowly recovering body again. Joe frets over his relationship with baby Kelly. Marsha tries to break things off with Michael because of Carolyn&#x27;s disapproval. Michael concurrently fears Rod is now pushing himself too hard to recover. Harry and his wife Alma (Ruby Dee) fear their son, Lew (Glynn Turman) doesn&#x27;t want to come home, but they soon prepare for his arrival.

Marsha catches Carolyn and Jeff near intimacy, leading to a lecture about sex. Michael convinces Marsha she can&#x27;t let Carolyn&#x27;s feelings dictate her life, and they become engaged. Young Lew Miles returns home to his parents. Despite her new job at the hospital, Jill fears she has nothing to offer baby Kelly. Susan drops adultery charges in favor of mental cruelty, then kisses Steven. Carolyn interrogates Michael about his intentions toward her mother, then feels jealous over Jeff&#x27;s suspected interest in singer Nancy. Rod goes outside on hospital grounds for the first time since his accident, alarming Betty whom he didn&#x27;t allow to accompany him, with Betty now fearing he wants to punish her. Harry and Alma wonder if Lew has changed radically. Joe tells Jill he wants to marry her, while Carolyn mourns the possible loss of her romance with Jeff.
Joe seems intent on leaving Peyton Place, causing guilt feelings for brother Michael, until Jill comes to reconcile with him. Harry and Alma discover Lew has been skipping classes. Rod is edgy when he sees Betty and Steven talking. Joe and Jill get married and regain custody of Kelly and leave Peyton Place soon after. Jill says goodbye to Tom, which sinks him even deeper into his emotional struggle, while Susan tries to reach out to him with Jill now gone. Rod ends his therapy, upsetting Michael. Lew admits to his parents he was edgy about how black people are treated in New York. Steven tries a tough approach with Rod—threatening to try pursuing Betty again unless Rod continues his therapy—but all that does is make Rod reluctant to see Betty. As Betty goes to Tom for advice on her marriage, Steven admits to Susan he still loves Betty, but kisses Susan. A phone call from Hannah Cord interrupts them, with Hannah revealing Martin Peyton&#x27;s death.

Carolyn and Jeff begin seeing each other again. Steven immediately focuses on Martin&#x27;s will. Harry fears his son will compromise a future medical career. Michael sees Carolyn sneak into Jeff&#x27;s home, then advises Marsha not to interfere until Carolyn reveals she isn&#x27;t sexually active with Jeff. Betty inherits Martin&#x27;s money as his will mandated through her marriage to Rod. Lew Miles talks to Michael about his racial identity and struggle with it. Betty urges Rod not to let Steven interfere in their marriage any longer, then shows a little of her new financial power by arranging Martin&#x27;s funeral over Hannah&#x27;s and Steven&#x27;s objections. Lew&#x27;s constant racial references unsettle Harry, who reminds his son of his own greater struggle in a far less accepting time while going through medical school. Susan wants to conspire with Steven to ruin Betty. Rod begins pushing himself harder to recover, while Steven drops none-too-subtle sly innuendos.

Fred orders Jeff to stay away from Carolyn, then threatens to sue Marsha for custody of their daughter. After Marsha turns to Michael for counsel, Michael formally proposes to Marsha. Norman admits to Rita he thinks Betty isn&#x27;t the right wife for Rod, but Rita disagrees and after they argue she goes to her mother Ada&#x27;s to stay awhile. Carolyn tells Fred she wants to live with him until she finds him with another young woman. Norman and Betty argue over the portrait Martin had done of her, while Betty ponders buying the Peyton mansion. Marsha accepts Michael&#x27;s marriage proposal. Susan tells Betty she intends to live in the Peyton mansion with Steven, while the future Rossis visit the Mileses for dinner. Phone calls between Lew and a woman in New York alarm his parents and cause his girlfriend Joanne Walker—the daughter of a Peyton Place police sergeant—to fear he cheated on her there. Fred suggests to Carolyn he wants to reconcile with her mother, but Marsha refuses to consider it.

Betty offers Steven a fat price for the mansion, while Steven orders Susan to tell Rod Betty has been seeing him. Norman and Rita have settled their argument and now try playing matchmaker for widow Maggie Riggs (Florida Friebus), with Eli Carson as the intended match. Marsha persuades Michael to elope. Lew&#x27;s New York friend, Vickie (Judy Pace), arrives in Peyton Place, declares her pregnancy, and attempts to blackmail Lew, threatening to lie about him to police, though she acknowledges to Lew that another young man is the actual father. We learn Lew was involved in a hit-and-run accident in New York that left someone in a coma. Lew surprises his parents by agreeing to marry Vickie. After Steven accepts Betty&#x27;s offer, Betty follows him to Boston where they both learn Martin changed his will yet again—sending all his money to a foundation, thus also cutting out all his grandsons as well as Betty—and she inherits nothing, for which she blames Steven.

Rod relapses after an argument with Betty and Norman blames her for his condition. Eli and Maggie have a blind date on which everything misfires. Harry tries and fails to buy Vickie out of town. Michael informs Betty that Rod now has serious doubts about their marriage, while Carolyn tries to persuade Marsha her father really does want to reconcile.

Harry begins learning more about his son from the police. Eli begins breaking through Maggie&#x27;s initial hostility. Betty begins packing the house but Rod&#x27;s ability to move begins to return. Alma wants Vickie to surrender her baby for adoption. Lew tries to learn what his father and Sgt. Walker talked about and promises Vickie to come clean with his father after Harry returns from New York. Concurrently, Lew&#x27;s fear of exposing himself alienates Joanne.

Angered over Carolyn&#x27;s refusal to date him steadily again and over Fred attacking him after seeing an argument between him and Carolyn, Jeff lies to Fred that Carolyn is dating Lew. Betty pleads to Rod that she can&#x27;t live without him while fearing he may think he can. After Fred confronts Marsha saying he believes Carolyn and Lew are dating, Marsha refuses to believe him but she worries how the town would react to an inter-racial romance between two teens. Carolyn forces Jeff to admit to Fred he lied about her and Lew, though Fred doesn&#x27;t believe it. Now recovering once again, Rod decides to leave Peyton Place and return to college. Maggie fears she hurt Eli by going on an ice fishing trip. Lew is uncomfortable with Carolyn and wants to stop hanging out with her, fearing their racial differences. Maggie tells Eli sad details about her marriage, including the lack of true togetherness she experienced with her late husband. Rod finally admits he believes he and Betty have a future together. Realising she loves Rod more than anything, including money, Betty goes to Boston with him to help him prepare for and work through college, surprising Steven.

Fred&#x27;s continued insistence that Lew and Carolyn really are dating has ramifications for Harry, who fears Fred had something to do with a patient refusing Harry&#x27;s treatment. Carolyn can&#x27;t convince her father she and Lew are only friends, and Carolyn and Lew&#x27;s alleged romance is the talk of the high school. When Betty returns to wind up her and Rod&#x27;s Peyton Place affairs, including selling their home, Martin&#x27;s longtime nurse Jennifer Ivers reveals Martin had several wills. Jeff now can&#x27;t convince Fred he lied about their relationship. Fred tries to stop Carolyn and Lew from entering the school, leading to a heated confrontation with Michael. Michael asks Marsha to marry him that night and she agrees. Carolyn apologises to her mother for not trusting her in the past. Eli proposes to Maggie. Jennifer wants Betty&#x27;s help to keep Hannah from inheriting any Peyton money, but doesn&#x27;t reveal she&#x27;s actually conspiring with Hannah. As Marsha prepares to marry Michael Fred attacks and tries to rape her, but she escapes as police she previously called for protection arrive.

Vickie apologizes to Lew for her blackmail attempt. Steven is shocked to discover Hannah still trying to destroy Betty. Marsha and Sgt. Walker find Michael next to an unconscious Fred. Harry determines Fred suffered a severe skull injury. Remembering what happened to Rod when he gave police a statement over Joe Chernak&#x27;s accidental death on the wharf—and knowing Michael, too, sought only to try once more to talk Fred away from his former wife—Steven warns Michael not to give police any statement. Lew admits his hit-and-run involvement to Alma. While Steven meets with an assistant district attorney who&#x27;s building a case against Michael, weakened but still-delusional Fred tells Marsha Michael was responsible for his condition. Harry destroys a police report on Lew. Marsha tells Carolyn what happened to her father. Michael tells Marsha and Sgt. Walker of Fred&#x27;s death, and Michael is booked for his murder.

Michael is denied bail. Maggie agrees to marry Eli. Susan admits to Tom she has misgivings about Steven defending Michael while still obsessed with the Peyton fortune. Carolyn visits Michael in his cell and tells him she believes he&#x27;s innocent. Betty and Norman argue over the possibility of Steven finally inheriting Martin&#x27;s estate. Alma invites Vickie to stay in the Miles home more permanently until they can resolve her pregnancy, now that the Miles know Lew isn&#x27;t the real father. Harry doesn&#x27;t want to hear his son&#x27;s confession, while Marsha asks Tom to arrange Fred&#x27;s funeral. Michael prepares for his preliminary hearing. Harry learns from Sgt. Walker about a man implicating Lew in the New York hit-and-run. Susan breaks down in front of Tom. Steven thinks Fred may really have died at the hands of the husband or boyfriend of one of his before-and-after-divorce dalliances. Visiting Michael in his jail cell, Rita tells him she thinks she may be pregnant. Walker, Marsha, Norman, Rita, Ada, Harry, and a motel proprietor testify at the preliminary hearing.

Michael is bound over for trial. Lew fears his chances at fairness as a black youth if he surrenders in the hit-and-run, after seeing a popular white doctor accused of murder, but he agrees to surrender rather than run. Susan plans to visit Michael in jail. The series ends with Michael—who once thought he loved Constance MacKenzie, who did love Ann Howard until her murder, and who prepared to marry Marsha Russell when her ex-husband died, leaving him charged with his murder—alone in his cell, pondering his future, leaving viewers to ponder likewise.

===Minor characters played by recognizable actors===
Thomas was Martin Peyton&#x27;s chauffeur, originally portrayed by James Doohan from &quot;Star Trek&quot; in about a dozen episodes. Just one episode after Thomas leaves town on an errand, another &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor, Nichelle Nichols turns up for two episodes as Martin Peyton&#x27;s nurse. Later, Doohan returned for an episode before the character Thomas was taken over by another actor.

Other notable guest stars; a recurring policeman character portrayed by Greg Morris, Dabbs Greer plays a member of the parole board who contemplates the release of Eliott Carson, and in the second and third seasons, Fred Crane plays Ralph Courtney, replacing the first season&#x27;s pharmacist.

A future Academy Award-winning actor who had two brief appearances on the series was Richard Dreyfuss. In one early episode, he is seen dropping stacks of the newspaper &quot;The Clarion&quot; from the back of a delivery truck. In the episode in which Rodney and Allison are preparing to graduate from high school, he has dialogue as an annoyed student who has been waiting for them as they are the last ones to pick up their caps and gowns.

==Schedules==

When &quot;Peyton Place&quot; premiered in 1964, the show aired twice a week. Both installments were Top 20 hits in the Nielsen ratings, and this inspired ABC to air the show three times a week, starting in the summer of 1965. This move caused trouble for viewers who followed the show religiously, and many tuned out. The seasonal ratings for &quot;Peyton Place&quot; never rose into the Top 30 again and the serial&#x27;s production reverted to two episodes a week. In 1969, with it losing viewers with each episode, &quot;Peyton Place&quot; aired as one installment a week until the final episode on June 2. On February 5, 1969, its Wednesday installment was replaced with a new sketch comedy series, &quot;Turn-On&quot;; that series would be cancelled after its first and only episode following negative reaction.

The series was one of the first seen on American network television to talk about sex and infidelity in a frank manner. As such, ABC executives would only allow the show to be aired at 9:30 p.m. Eastern/Pacific time, a time at which many children and teenagers were expected to be in bed. With the show in a ratings slump in 1968, it was moved to 8:30 p.m. in order to draw the viewers it once had shunned.

==Sequels==
The series was revived as a daytime serial from April 3, 1972, to January 4, 1974 as &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;. Three of the actors from the primetime series reprised their roles on the daytime series – Frank Ferguson as Eli Carson, Patricia Morrow as Rita Harrington, and Evelyn Scott as Ada Jacks, while the rest of the characters were recast with new actors. However, the daytime series did not prove to be as successful as the primetime series had been. It was never rerun on television, and appears to be lost.

Two television movies followed, both only vaguely followed the original show&#x27;s continuity. The first, &quot;Murder in Peyton Place&quot; was broadcast on NBC in the fall of 1977. Billed as a reunion movie it focused on the mysterious deaths of Rodney Harrington and Allison MacKenzie, as well as a diabolical plot of a powerful person to ruin the community. It reunited original cast members Dorothy Malone, Ed Nelson, Tim O&#x27;Connor, Joyce Jillson, and Christopher Connelly, while the rest of the returning characters were recast.

The second, &quot;Peyton Place: The Next Generation&quot; which aired in the spring of 1985 on NBC, was conceived as a one-shot sequel, that would hopefully revive the popular series and was therefore also promoted as a television pilot. It ignored the events of &quot;Murder in Peyton Place&quot;. Although a new series of the show never came to fruition, the film did reunite original cast members Dorothy Malone, Ed Nelson, Tim O&#x27;Connor, James Douglas, Christopher Connelly, Ruth Warrick and Barbara Parkins, who had declined to appear in &quot;Murder in Peyton Place.&quot;

<doc id="742316" wikidata="Q1519217" url="?curid=742316" title="Critical pedagogy">
<text>Critical pedagogy is a philosophy of education and social movement that developed and applied concepts from critical theory and related traditions to the field of education and the study of culture.

It insists that issues of social justice and democracy are not distinct from acts of teaching and learning. The goal of critical pedagogy is emancipation from oppression through an awakening of the critical consciousness, based on the Portuguese term &quot;conscientização&quot;. When achieved, critical consciousness encourages individuals to effect change in their world through social critique and political action in order to self-actualize.

Critical pedagogy was founded by the Brazilian philosopher and educator Paulo Freire, who promoted it through his 1968 book, &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;. It subsequently spread internationally, developing a particularly strong base in the United States, where proponents sought to develop means of using teaching to combat racism, sexism, and oppression. As it grew, it incorporated elements from fields like the Human rights movement, Civil rights movement, Disability rights movement, Indigenous rights movement, postmodern theory, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, and queer theory.

== Background ==
Critical Pedagogy is believed to have its roots in the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, which was established in 1923. As an outgrowth of critical theory, critical pedagogy is intended to educate and work towards a realization of the emancipatory goals of critical pedagogy. The theory is influenced by Karl Marx who believed that inequality is a result of socioeconomic differences and that all people need to work toward a socialized economy. More recently, critical pedagogy can also be traced back to Paulo Freire&#x27;s best-known 1968 work, &quot;The Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;. Freire, a professor of history and the philosophy of education at the Federal University of Pernambuco in Brazil, sought in this and other works to develop a philosophy of adult education that demonstrated a solidarity with the poor in their common struggle to survive by engaging them in a dialog of greater awareness and analysis. Although his family had suffered loss and hunger during the Great Depression, the poor viewed him and his formerly middle-class family &quot;as people from another world who happened to fall accidentally into their world&quot;. His intimate discovery of class and their borders &quot;led, invariably, to Freire&#x27;s radical rejection of a class-based society&quot;.

While prominent figures within Critical Pedagogy include Paulo Freire, Henry Giroux, Peter McLaren, bell hooks, and others, it is important to note that their work on critical pedagogy varies in focus. For example, some approach critical pedagogy from a Marxist perspective with a focus on socioeconomic class. Paulo Freire, on the other hand, writes about how critical pedagogy can lead to liberty and freedom of the oppressed and marginalized. bell hooks applies a feminist perspective to critical pedagogy and Ira Shor, for example, advocates for the need of moving the theoretical framework of critical pedagogy to a more practical one.

The influential works of Freire made him arguably the most celebrated critical educator. He seldom used the term &quot;critical pedagogy&quot; himself when describing this philosophy. His initial focus targeted adult literacy projects in Brazil and later was adapted to deal with a wide range of social and educational issues. Freire&#x27;s pedagogy revolved around an anti-authoritarian and interactive approach aimed to examine issues of relational power for students and workers. The center of the curriculum used the fundamental goal based on social and political critiques of everyday life. Freire&#x27;s praxis required implementation of a range of educational practices and processes with the goal of creating not only a better learning environment but also a better world. Freire himself maintained that this was not merely an educational technique but a way of living in our educative practice.

Freire endorses students&#x27; ability to think critically about their education situation; this method of thinking is thought by practitioners of critical pedagogy to allow them to &quot;recognize connections between their individual problems and experiences and the social contexts in which they are embedded&quot;. Realizing one&#x27;s consciousness (&quot;conscientization&quot;, &quot;conscientização&quot;) is then a needed first step of &quot;praxis&quot;, which is defined as the power and know-how to take action against oppression while stressing the importance of liberating education. &quot;Praxis involves engaging in a cycle of theory, application, evaluation, reflection, and then back to theory. Social transformation is the product of praxis at the collective level.&quot;

Critical pedagogue Ira Shor, who was mentored by and worked closely with Freire from 1980 until Freire&#x27;s death in 1997, defines critical pedagogy as:

Critical pedagogy explores the dialogic relationships between teaching and learning. Its proponents claim that it is a continuous process of what they call &quot;unlearning&quot;, &quot;learning&quot;, and &quot;relearning&quot;, &quot;reflection&quot;, &quot;evaluation&quot;, and the effect that these actions have on the students, in particular students whom they believe have been historically and continue to be disenfranchised by what they call &quot;traditional schooling&quot;.

The educational philosophy has since been developed by Henry Giroux and others since the 1980s as a praxis-oriented &quot;educational movement, guided by passion and principle, to help students develop a consciousness of freedom, recognize authoritarian tendencies, and connect knowledge to power and the ability to take constructive action&quot;. Freire wrote the introduction to his 1988 work, &quot;Teachers as Intellectuals: Toward a Critical Pedagogy of Learning.&quot; Another leading critical pedagogy theorist who Freire called his &quot;intellectual cousin&quot;, Peter McLaren, wrote the foreword. McLaren and Giroux co-edited one book on critical pedagogy and co-authored another in the 1990s. Among its other leading figures in no particular order are bell hooks (Gloria Jean Watkins), Joe L. Kincheloe, Patti Lather, Myles Horton, Antonia Darder, Gloria Ladson-Billings, Peter McLaren, Khen Lampert, Howard Zinn, Donaldo Macedo, Dermeval Saviani, Sandy Grande, Michael Apple, and Stephanie Ledesma. Educationalists including Jonathan Kozol and Parker Palmer are sometimes included in this category. Other critical pedagogues known more for their Anti-schooling, unschooling, or deschooling perspectives include Ivan Illich, John Holt, Ira Shor, John Taylor Gatto, and Matt Hern.

Critical pedagogy has several other strands and foundations. Postmodern, anti-racist, feminist, postcolonial, queer, and environmental theories all play a role in further expanding and enriching Freire&#x27;s original ideas about a critical pedagogy, shifting its main focus on social class to include issues pertaining to religion, military identification, race, gender, sexuality, nationality, ethnicity, and age. Much of the work also draws on anarchism, György Lukács, Wilhelm Reich, postcolonialism, and the discourse theories of Edward Said, Antonio Gramsci, Gilles Deleuze (rhizomatic learning) and Michel Foucault. &quot;Radical Teacher&quot; is a magazine dedicated to critical pedagogy and issues of interest to critical educators. Many contemporary critical pedagogues have embraced Postmodern, anti-essentialist perspectives of the individual, of language, and of power, &quot;while at the same time retaining the Freirean emphasis on critique, disrupting oppressive regimes of power/knowledge, and social change&quot;.

==Developments and critiques==
Like critical theory itself, the field of critical pedagogy continues to evolve. Contemporary critical educators, such as bell hooks and Peter McLaren, discuss in their criticisms the influences of many varied concerns, institutions, and social structures, &quot;including globalization, the mass media, and race/spiritual relations&quot;, while citing reasons for resisting the possibilities to change. McLaren has developed a social movement based version of critical pedagogy that he calls revolutionary critical pedagogy, emphasizing critical pedagogy as a social movement for the creation of a democratic socialist alternative to capitalism.

Curry Malott and Derek R. Ford&#x27;s first collaborative book, &quot;Marx, Capital, and Education&quot; built on McLaren&#x27;s revolutionary pedagogy by connecting it to the global class struggle and the history of the actually-existing workers&#x27; movements. As Curry Malott noted, &quot;Critical pedagogy was created as a break from the Marxism of Freire&#x27;s Pedagogy of the Oppressed and Bowles and Gintis&#x27; Schooling in Capitalist America. Even though it is true that critical pedagogy has become increasingly domesticated and watered down, it&#x27;s birth was an act of counterrevolution itself.&quot; In particular, they argued for a critical pedagogy that simultaneously pursued communism and national liberation. Malott and Ford were the first authors to bring Harry Haywood&#x27;s work into critical pedagogy. They believed that critical pedagogy had been divorced from its radical roots. Yet when Malott went to re-investigate those roots, he decided that they were not revolutionary at all. In fact, he argued that they were permeated by anti-communism and hostility to any actually-existing struggles of oppressed peoples. As a result, both Malott and Ford moved away from critical pedagogy. Ford developed a &quot;political&quot; pedagogy that built on McLaren&#x27;s revolutionary critical pedagogy but took &quot;a distanced and expository position&quot; to link the project more explicitly to communism. Yet he later abandoned that as a starting point and instead turned his attention to educational &quot;forms&quot;.

Joe L. Kincheloe and Shirley R. Steinberg have created the Paulo and Nita Freire Project for International Critical Pedagogy at McGill University. In line with Kincheloe and Steinberg&#x27;s contributions to critical pedagogy, the project attempts to move the field to the next phase of its evolution. In this second phase, critical pedagogy seeks to become a worldwide, decolonizing movement dedicated to listening to and learning from diverse discourses of people from around the planet. Kincheloe and Steinberg also embrace Indigenous knowledges in education as a way to expand critical pedagogy and to question educational hegemony. Joe L. Kincheloe, in expanding on the Freire&#x27;s notion that a pursuit of social change alone could promote anti-intellectualism, promotes a more balanced approach to education than postmodernists.

One of the major texts taking on the intersection between critical pedagogy and Indigenous knowledge(s) is Sandy Grande&#x27;s, &quot;Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought&quot; (Rowman and Littlefield, 2004). In agreement with this perspective, Four Arrows, aka Don Trent Jacobs, challenges the anthropocentrism of critical pedagogy and writes that to achieve its transformative goals there are other differences between Western and Indigenous worldview that must be considered. Approaching the intersection of Indigenous perspectives and pedagogy from another perspective, critical pedagogy of place examines the impacts of place.

=== In the classroom ===
Ira Shor, a professor at the City University of New York, provides for an example of how critical pedagogy is used in the classroom. He develops these themes in looking at the use of Freirean teaching methods in the context of the everyday life of classrooms, in particular, institutional settings. He suggests that the whole curriculum of the classroom must be re-examined and reconstructed. He favors a change of role of the student from object to active, critical subject. In doing so, he suggests that students undergo a struggle for ownership of themselves. He states that students have previously been lulled into a sense of complacency by the circumstances of everyday life and that through the processes of the classroom, they can begin to envision and strive for something different for themselves.

Of course, achieving such a goal is not automatic nor easy, as he suggests that the role of the teacher is critical to this process. Students need to be helped by teachers to separate themselves from unconditional acceptance of the conditions of their own existence. Once this separation is achieved, then students may be prepared for critical re-entry into an examination of everyday life. In a classroom environment that achieves such liberating intent, one of the potential outcomes is that the students themselves assume more responsibility for the class. Power is thus distributed amongst the group and the role of the teacher becomes much more mobile, not to mention more challenging. This encourages the growth of each student&#x27;s intellectual character rather than a mere &quot;mimicry of the professorial style.&quot;

Teachers, however, do not simply abdicate their authority in a student-centered classroom. In the later years of his life, Freire grew increasingly concerned with what he felt was a major misinterpretation of his work and insisted that teachers cannot deny their position of authority.

And due to the student-centeredness that critical pedagogy insists upon, there are inherent conflicts associated with the &quot;large collections of top-down content standards in their disciplines&quot;. Critical pedagogy advocates insist that teachers themselves are vital to the discussion about Standards-based education reform in the United States because a pedagogy that requires a student to learn or a teacher to teach externally imposed information exemplifies the banking model of education outlined by Freire where the structures of knowledge are left unexamined. To the critical pedagogue, the teaching act must incorporate social critique alongside the cultivation of intellect.

Joe L. Kincheloe argues that this is in direct opposition to the epistemological concept of positivism, where &quot;social actions should proceed with law-like predictability&quot;. In this philosophy, a teacher and their students would be served by Standards-based education where there is &quot;only be one correct way to teach&quot; as &quot;[e]veryone is assumed to be the same regardless of race, class, or gender&quot;. Donald Schön&#x27;s concept of &quot;indeterminate zones of practice&quot; illustrates how any practice, especially ones with human subjects at their center, are infinitely complex and highly contested, which amplify the critical pedagogue&#x27;s unwillingness to apply universal practices.

Furthermore, bell hooks, who is greatly influenced by Freire, points out the importance of engaged pedagogy and the responsibility that teachers, as well as students, must have in the classroom:

== Resistance from students ==
Students sometimes resist critical pedagogy. Student resistance to critical pedagogy can be attributed to a variety of reasons. Student objections may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: &quot;Resistance in this context thus occurs when students are asked to shift not only their perspectives, but also their subjectivities as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed.&quot; Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or ideologies, introduced in the classroom, is a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.

Kristen Seas further explains: &quot;Students [often] reject the teacher&#x27;s message because they see it as coercive, they do not agree with it, or they feel excluded by it.&quot; Karen Kopelson concludes &quot;that many if not most students come to the university in order to gain access to and eventual enfranchisement in &#x27;the establishment,&#x27; not to critique and reject its privileges.&quot;

== Critical pedagogy of teaching ==
The rapidly changing demographics of the classroom in the United States has resulted in an unprecedented amount of linguistic and cultural diversity. In order to respond to these changes, advocates of critical pedagogy call into question the focus on practical skills of teacher credential programs. &quot;[T]his practical focus far too often occurs without examining teachers&#x27; own assumptions, values, and beliefs and how this ideological posture informs, often unconsciously, their perceptions and actions when working with linguistic-minority and other politically, socially, and economically subordinated students.&quot; As teaching is considered an inherently political act to the critical pedagogue, a more critical element of teacher education becomes addressing implicit biases (also known as implicit cognition or implicit stereotypes) that can subconsciously affect a teacher&#x27;s perception of a student&#x27;s ability to learn.

Advocates of critical pedagogy insist that teachers, then, must become learners alongside their students, as well as students &quot;of&quot; their students. They must become experts beyond their field of knowledge, and immerse themselves in the culture, customs, and lived experiences of the students they aim to teach.

== Criticism ==
Critical pedagogy has been the subject of varied debates inside and outside the field of education. Philosopher John Searle characterized the goal of Giroux&#x27;s form of critical pedagogy &quot;to create political radicals&quot;, thus highlighting the antagonistic moral and political grounds of the ideals of citizenship and &quot;public wisdom.&quot; These varying moral perspectives of what is right are to be found in what John Dewey has referred to as the tensions between traditional and progressive education. Searle argued that critical pedagogy&#x27;s objections to the Western canon are misplaced and/or disingenuous:

In 1992, Maxine Hairston took a hard line against critical pedagogy in the first year college composition classroom and argued, &quot;everywhere I turn I find composition faculty, both leaders in the profession and new voices, asserting that they have not only the right, but the duty, to put ideology and radical politics at the center of their teaching.&quot; Hairston further confers,

Sharon O&#x27;Dair (2003) said that compositionists &quot;focus [...] almost exclusively on ideological matters&quot;, and further argues that this focus is at the expense of proficiency of student writing skills in the composition classroom. To this end, O&#x27;Dair explained that &quot;recently advocated working-class pedagogies privilege activism over &quot;language instruction.&quot; Jeff Smith argued that students want to gain, rather than to critique, positions of privilege, as encouraged by critical pedagogues.

Scholars who have worked in the field of critical pedagogy have also critiqued the movement from various angles. In 2016, Curry Stephenson Malott, who had written several books about critical pedagogy and identified as a critical pedagogue, renounced and critiqued his previous work. In &quot;History and Education: Engaging the Global Class War&quot;, he writes about his &quot;long journey of self-reflection and de-indoctrination&quot; that culminated in the break. Malott writes that &quot;the term critical pedagogy was created by Henry Giroux (1981) as an attempt to dismiss socialism and the legacy of Karl Marx.&quot; During the same period, Derek R. Ford also broke with critical pedagogy, claiming that it was &quot;at a dead end.&quot; While Ford is not concerned with &quot;proficiency&quot; like O&#x27;Dair, he agrees that the focus on critique at the expense of imagination and actual political engagement serves to produce the critical pedagogue as &quot;the enlightened and isolated researcher that reveals the truth behind the curtain.&quot; Both Malott and Ford, however, note exceptions to their critiques within the field, such as the work of Peter McLaren.

<text>Faraday&#x27;s laws of electrolysis are quantitative relationships based on the electrochemical research published by Michael Faraday in 1833.

== First law ==

Michael Faraday reported that the mass () of a substance deposited or liberated at an electrode is directly proportional to the charge (, for which the SI unit is the ampere-second or coulomb).
formula_1

Here, the constant of proportionality, , is called the electro-chemical equivalent (ECE) of the substance. Thus, the ECE can be defined as the mass of the substance deposited or liberated per unit charge.

== Second law ==

Faraday discovered that when the same amount of electric current is passed through different electrolytes connected in series, the masses of the substances deposited or liberated at the electrodes are directly proportional to their respective chemical equivalent/equivalent weight (). This turns out to be the molar mass () divided by the valence ()
: formula_2

== Derivation ==

A monovalent ion requires one electron for discharge, a divalent ion requires two electrons for discharge and so on. Thus, if electrons flow, formula_3 atoms are discharged.

Thus, the mass discharged is
formula_4
where 
* is the Avogadro constant;
* is the total charge, equal to the number of electrons () times the elementary charge ;
* is the Faraday constant.

== Mathematical form ==

Faraday&#x27;s laws can be summarized by
: formula_5
where is the molar mass of the substance (usually given in SI units of grams per mole) and is the valency of the ions .

For Faraday&#x27;s first law, are constants; thus, the larger the value of , the larger will be.

For Faraday&#x27;s second law, are constants; thus, the larger the value of formula_6 (equivalent weight), the larger will be.

In the simple case of constant-current electrolysis, , leading to
: formula_7
and then to
: formula_8
where:
* is the amount of substance (&quot;number of moles&quot;) liberated: formula_9
* is the total time the constant current was applied.

For the case of an alloy whose constituents have different valencies, we have
formula_10
where represents the mass fraction of the th element.

In the more complicated case of a variable electric current, the total charge is the electric current integrated over time :
: formula_11

Here is the &quot;total&quot; electrolysis time.

== Applications ==
* Electroplating – a process where a thin layer of metal is deposited onto the surface of an object using an electric current
* Electrochemical cells – generates electrical energy from chemical reactions
* Electrotyping – a process used to create metal copies of designs by depositing metal onto a mold using electroplating
* Electrowinning – a process that extract metals from their solutions using an electric current
* Electroforming – a process that deposits metal onto a mold or substrate to create metal parts
* Anodization – a process that converts the surface of a metal into a durable corrosion-resistant oxide layer
* Conductive polymers – organic polymers that conduct electricity 
* Water electrolysis – a process that uses an electric current to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gases
* Electrolytic capacitors – a type of capacitor that uses an electrolytic solution as one of its plates

<doc id="742320" wikidata="Q353524" url="?curid=742320" title="Yōsuke Matsuoka">
<text>was a Japanese diplomat and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Empire of Japan during the early stages of World War II. He is best known for his defiant speech at the League of Nations in February 1933, ending Japan&#x27;s participation in the organization. He was also one of the architects of the Tripartite Pact and the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in the years immediately prior to the outbreak of war.

==Early years in Japan and the United States==
Matsuoka was born as the fourth son to a shipping magnate in Kumage District, Yamaguchi Prefecture (now part of the city of Hikari). At the age of 11, his father&#x27;s business went bankrupt, and Matsuoka was sent to the United States with a cousin in 1893 under the sponsorship of Methodist missionaries to study English. He settled in Portland, Oregon, living initially at the Methodist Mission, and was subsequently taken into the household of the widower William Dunbar, which included Dunbar&#x27;s son Lambert, and Dunbar&#x27;s sister, Mrs. Isabelle Dunbar Beveridge. Mrs. Beveridge served as a foster mother to Matsuoka and helped him adjust to American society. Matsuoka&#x27;s affection for her lasted well after he returned to Japan. She died in 1906.

Matsuoka enrolled at Portland&#x27;s Atkinson Grammar School (which still exists as Atkinson Elementary School), and due to the influence of the Mrs. Beveridge and the Dunbar family, became a Presbyterian Christian, being baptized by a Rev. Kawabe, taking the name of &quot;Frank Matsuoka&quot;. He later moved to Oakland, California, with his older brother Kensuke and attended Oakland High School for 18 months. He then returned to Portland and studied law, paying his way by various odd jobs, including busboy, door-to-door salesman (of coffee) and interpreter for a Japanese contractor.

Matsuoka graduated from the University of Oregon law school in 1900. Although the University of Oregon had strong connections with Waseda University in Japan, Matsuoka considered going on to an Ivy League school for post-graduate studies. However, the deteriorating health of his mother influenced his return to Japan in 1902.

== Foreign service ==
On Matsuoka&#x27;s return to Japan in 1902, he attempted to gain admission to Tokyo Imperial University, but was unsuccessful due to his lack of connections and the lack of acceptance of his studies overseas by the Tokyo University Law School. In 1904, Matsuoka decided to pursue a career as a bureaucrat instead, and passed the Foreign Service examinations and was accepted into the Foreign Ministry. Within two years, he was appointed vice-consul at the Japanese consulate in Shanghai. He was subsequently attached to the Governor-General of the Kwantung Leased Territory, where he became acquainted with Gotō Shinpei, then president of the South Manchuria Railway and Yamamoto Jōtarō, then working for Mitsui in developing the natural resources of Manchuria. Over the next 18 years Matsuoka advanced quickly through the ranks of diplomats. He was briefly assigned as First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Washington D.C. in 1914, and was a member of the Japanese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Matsuoka served as secretary to Prime Minister Terauchi and to Terauchi&#x27;s Foreign Minister Gotō Shinpei, where his knowledge of the English language was an asset. Matsuoka was also an outspoken defender of Japanese participation in the Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik forces in the Russian Civil War.

==South Manchurian Railway and political career==

Matsuoka was assigned as Japanese Consul to China in 1921, but turned down the assignment to return to Manchuria as a director of the South Manchurian Railway Company in 1922. In 1927, Matsuoka was promoted to the position of Vice-President of the South Manchurian Railway Company. He was also responsible for the expansion of the coal mines in Fushun and the construction of a coal liquefaction plant. However, in 1930, he resigned from the South Manchurian Railway and returned to Japan.
In the 1930 General Election, Matsuoka ran for a seat in the Lower House of the Diet of Japan from Yamaguchi Prefecture with the support of the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; (Constitutional Association of Political Friendship) political party.

However, following the Manchurian Incident of 1931, the establishment of Manchukuo and the Lytton Report to the League of Nations condemning Japan&#x27;s actions, Matsuoka was drawn back into the arena of foreign affairs to head Japan&#x27;s delegation to the League of Nations in 1933. Matsuoka gained international notoriety for a speech condemning the League of Nations and announcing Japan&#x27;s withdrawal, leading the Japanese delegation out of the League&#x27;s assembly hall.

Following his return to Japan, Matsuoka announced his resignation from the &quot;Rikken Seiyūkai&quot; and his intent to form his own political party modeled after the National Fascist Party in Italy. However, the party never gained the mass support Matsuoka had anticipated, and in 1935 he returned to Manchuria as president of the South Manchuria Railway. He held that post until 1939. Despite his admiration of the Italian fascist movement, Matsuoka was also a supporter of the plan to settle Jewish refugees in Manchukuo.

== Foreign Minister of Japan, 1940-41 ==

In 1940, Matsuoka was asked to assume the cabinet position of Minister of Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Matsuoka was a major advocate of a Japanese alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, whose assistance he saw as a perfect balancing force against the United States, and as such was one of the primary orchestrators of the Tripartite Pact in 1940.

On December 31, 1940, Matsuoka told a group of Jewish businessmen that he was &quot;the man responsible for the alliance with Adolf Hitler, but nowhere have I promised that we would carry out his antisemitic policies in Japan. This is not simply my personal opinion, it is the opinion of Japan, and I have no compunction about announcing it to the world.&quot;

During March–April 1941 Matsuoka visited Moscow and Berlin. On March 29, 1941, at a conversation with German Minister of Foreign Affairs Joachim von Ribbentrop, Ribbentrop was instructed to not tell the Japanese anything about the upcoming Operation Barbarossa, and that the Japanese be kept in the dark about Germany&#x27;s plans. Ribbentrop tried to convince Matsuoka to urge the government in Tokyo to attack Singapore, claiming the British navy was too weak to retaliate due to its involvement in the Battle of the Atlantic. Matsuoka responded to this by stating preparations to occupy Singapore were under way.

Matsuoka also signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact during his visit to Moscow in April 1941. However, after Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Hitler proposed to Matsuoka that Japan take part in the attack as well. Matsuoka became a fervent supporter of the idea of a Japanese attack on Siberia, and constantly pressured Konoe and the leaders of the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy to mobilize the military for that purpose. In the end, both the army and the navy as well as Konoe decided to concentrate military efforts on targets south of Japan.

Despite the military&#x27;s opposition to his ideas, Matsuoka continued to loudly advocate an invasion of Russia and became increasingly reckless in his diplomatic dealings with the United States, which he believed was conspiring to provoke Japan into a war. Matsuoka&#x27;s hostility towards the United States (a vocal opponent of Japan&#x27;s military campaigns) alarmed Konoe, who wanted to avoid war with the United States. Konoe and the military hierarchy colluded to get rid of Matsuoka. To this end, Konoe resigned in July 1941 and his cabinet ministers resigned with him, including Matsuoka. Konoe immediately was made prime minister again, and replaced Matsuoka as Foreign Minister with Admiral Teijirō Toyoda.

When the Pacific war broke out, Matsuoka professed, &quot;Entering into the Tripartite Pact was the mistake of my life. Even now I still keenly feel it. Even my death won&#x27;t take away this feeling.&quot; Matsuoka subsequently drifted into obscurity and lived in retirement through the war years.

==Post-war==
Following the surrender of Japan, Matsuoka was arrested by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in 1945 and held at Sugamo Prison. However, he died in prison of natural causes on June 26, 1946, before his trial on war crimes charges came up before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

In 1979, he was enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine, together with 12 convicted war criminals of the Pacific War.

<text>The Stardust Resort and Casino was a casino resort located on along the Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, Nevada. The Stardust was conceived by Tony Cornero, and construction began in 1954. Cornero died in 1955, and the project was taken over by his brother. The Stardust had numerous creditors, and construction was stopped in 1956, when the project ran out of money.

Rella Factor, the wife of John Factor, bought the Stardust in January 1958, and finished construction. The Stardust opened on July 2, 1958, as the world&#x27;s largest hotel. It had 1,065 rooms located across six motel structures, and included a casino. An adjacent hotel-casino, the Royal Nevada, became part of the Stardust in 1959, with its casino converted into Stardust convention space. A nine-story hotel addition was completed in 1964. The resort operated the off-site Stardust Country Club and the Stardust International Raceway during the 1960s, and in 1972, it became the first resort on the Las Vegas Strip to open an RV park for guests, a concept that proved to be popular.

After several ownership changes, Argent Corporation purchased the Stardust in 1974. Company executive Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal added a sportsbook in 1975 that would later become a popular attraction for the Stardust, and a model for future sportsbooks. In 1976, a state investigation found that a skimming operation was occurring at the Stardust and at Argent&#x27;s other properties. The Stardust was sold again in 1979, to Al Sachs and Herb Tobman, both of whom had previously served as general managers for the resort. Another investigation determined in 1983 that skimming was occurring at the Stardust again. The Nevada Gaming Commission concluded that Sachs and Tobman had failed to prevent the skimming, and the men agreed to sell the Stardust.

The Boyd family purchased it in 1985, and would retain ownership for the remainder of the resort&#x27;s history. The Stardust had been one of the few Las Vegas Strip resorts without a high-rise hotel tower, until the Boyds added a 32-story tower in 1990. The original Stardust motel structures were demolished around 2000, to make way for an expansion of the resort, although the nine-story tower was kept. In its final years, the Stardust included an casino and 1,552 hotel rooms. It was small compared to newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, and revenue fell during its last years.

Boyd Gaming announced in January 2006 that it would close and demolish the aging Stardust to build a new project, Echelon Place, on the site. The Stardust closed on November 1, 2006, and the two hotel towers were imploded on March 13, 2007. The resort had a popular roadside sign, which was given to the city&#x27;s Neon Museum. Construction on the Echelon project was halted in 2008, because of financial problems caused by the Great Recession. Genting Group bought the Echelon project in 2013, and announced plans to finish it as Resorts World Las Vegas. It opened in 2021, after several delays.

The Stardust hosted numerous entertainers and shows throughout its history. At its opening, it debuted &quot;Lido de Paris&quot;, which featured topless showgirls. The show continued playing until 1991, when it was replaced by a modernized show known as &quot;Enter the Night&quot;. Wayne Newton was the resort&#x27;s resident headliner from 2000 to 2005. Other entertainers who performed at the Stardust include Don Rickles, Tim Conway, Harvey Korman, Siegfried &amp; Roy, and Steve and Eydie.

Due to the brand&#x27;s lasting popularity, Boyd launched its &quot;Stardust Social Casino&quot; online game in 2020. The following year, Boyd partnered with FanDuel to launch Stardust-branded online casinos in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

== History ==
===Construction and financial problems===
The Stardust was conceived by Tony Cornero, also known as Tony Stralla. He and two partners applied for a gaming license in April 1954. However, the Nevada Tax Commission said that it would never grant a license to Cornero, who had previously engaged in illegal gaming operations. Despite the commission&#x27;s unwillingness, Cornero would make repeated attempts to gain approval. Work on the hotel was underway in August 1954, using tilt up construction. Approximately 60 percent of bricklayers in the Las Vegas Valley were hired to construct the Stardust, leaving few workers available to build new school facilities in the area.

The Stardust was scheduled to open in April 1955. However, a request for a gaming license was denied two months prior by the tax commission, which cited a policy that applications not be considered until a casino is one-third completed. Early on, the Stardust had more than 1,000 stockholders. Sale of the stock was banned in California in May 1955, as Cornero and his associates had been selling shares without a state permit. The Securities and Exchange Commission also alleged that Cornero had failed to file statements regarding Stardust stock sales.

Cornero eventually gave up on trying to receive a gaming license. Instead, he planned to lease the casino to a small group for $500,000 a month. The tax commission was concerned about the high rental cost, viewing it as an attempt by Cornero to get around his lack of a gaming license. Nevertheless, the group was licensed in June 1955, at which point the Stardust had 2,700 stockholders. A list of these individuals was to be provided to the Nevada Gaming Control Board for final approval, but this did not occur as scheduled, thus delaying the Stardust&#x27;s planned opening on August 1, 1955. The opening was pushed back a month.

Cornero died suddenly on July 31, 1955, while gambling at the nearby Desert Inn resort. His death was considered suspicious, and an investigation was soon opened. Tony&#x27;s brother, Louis Cornero, was named as the president and general manager of the Stardust. Louis Cornero was the mayor of St. Helena, California, and he only planned to remain with the Stardust until legal issues could be resolved. Construction shut down on August 1, 1955, amid a dispute with several labor unions. Work resumed the following month, and there were plans to have the resort opened by Christmas.

Frank Hofues, a Nevada hotel owner, agreed to lease the hotel rooms in November 1955. He also agreed to loan the project $2.5 million, with completion now expected by May 1, 1956. However, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of shareholders, challenging the loan by Hofues. Shareholders had been told by Tony Cornero that the resort could be completed for $4.5 million. The suit sought to have the Stardust placed into receivership, stating that borrowing an additional $2.5 million would not be in shareholders&#x27; best interest. Hofues died shortly thereafter, and it was later alleged that he had failed to refinance the Stardust as agreed. However, attorneys representing the Hofues estate said that his agreement had been terminated by the Stardust board of directors in June 1956.

The Stardust did not open as scheduled. In July 1956, creditors filed a petition to reorganize the resort, alleging that it owed $2 million in debt. The Stardust was 80-percent complete at the time, and it was alleged that there was no money left to finish construction, which would take another $1.2 million. A former member of the tax commission was appointed as receiver. Louis Cornero sought to regain control of the project, arguing that reorganization was not necessary to acquire construction financing. He also said that most of the creditors who sought reorganization were not eligible to do so. Stockholders alleged that Louis Cornero was incompetent in his position as president. The creditors&#x27; petition was ultimately approved.

In January 1957, several offers were put in by groups wanting to purchase and complete the Stardust. The Sheraton hotel chain was among prospective buyers for the resort, but eventually passed. United Hotels Corporation, which consisted of Desert Inn shareholders, also expressed an interest in buying the Stardust. By mid-1957, the Stardust had five prospective buyers, including Rella Factor, who was the wife of John Factor. Each buyer submitted a plan to pay off creditors, and Factor&#x27;s was viewed most favorably. In November 1957, Factor and her group received court approval to take over the Stardust, with an opening expected around April 1, 1958. Factor paid $4.3 million for the resort, and took over ownership in January 1958. Construction of the Stardust resumed that month, after 18 months of inactivity.

===Opening and early years===

The Stardust opened at 12:01 p.m. on July 2, 1958. Attendees of the opening included Nevada governor Charles H. Russell, U.S. senator George Malone, and various celebrities such as Bob Hope, Milton Berle, and Ethel Merman. The Stardust continued to face financial problems after its opening. John and Rella Factor had agreed to pay off the Stardust&#x27;s debt through monthly payments. However, a month after the opening, they requested a reduction in the amount of money to be paid out each month. Up to that point, the Stardust had more than $1 million in liens filed against it, and a local glass company filed a foreclosure suit against the resort later in the month. Also among the creditors were two attorneys, seeking payment after representing the first group of proposed casino managers in 1955.

The Stardust&#x27;s casino portion was managed by United Hotels Corporation, which also operated the Desert Inn. United Hotels took over complete management of the entire resort on September 1, 1958. United Hotels was renamed as United Resort Hotels in 1959, and the company continued to manage the Stardust hotel. The casino portion was now managed by Karat Inc., also consisting mostly of Desert Inn officials. The Desert Inn group took over ownership from the Factors in August 1962, after the Stardust exited reorganization. Investors from years earlier were soon reimbursed. Subsequently, the Teamsters Union Pension Fund made several loans to the Stardust. A nine-story hotel addition was completed in 1964. A year later, the Stardust was purchased by Lodestar, Inc., which consisted of major Desert Inn stockholders such as Moe Dalitz, who had affiliations with organized crime.

By the end of 1967, there were reports that Howard Hughes made a deal to purchase the Stardust for $40 million, although the agreement later fell apart. Negotiations were underway again in March 1968, despite monopoly concerns; Hughes already owned several other Las Vegas casinos. Hughes received preliminary approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which stated that his purchase would not give him a monopoly on Las Vegas gaming. However, a federal antitrust investigation was launched days before the purchase would have been finalized. Hughes eventually dropped his purchase plans in August 1968. Nevada governor Paul Laxalt criticized the investigation and denied that Hughes&#x27; purchase would have constituted a monopoly.

In 1969, Parvin-Dohrmann Corporation purchased the Stardust from Lodestar for nearly $40 million. Parvin-Dohrmann, based in Los Angeles, also operated the Fremont and Aladdin resorts in Las Vegas. Parvin-Dohrmann was renamed as Recrion Corporation in 1970, and Al Sachs was chosen as the new general manager for the Stardust, after serving as the casino manager there. During 1970, NASA loaned a Moon rock to the Stardust for display in the resort. A fire broke out at the Stardust two weeks later. The Moon rock was secured, and 500 people were evacuated. A fireman was killed, and several guests had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Arson was ruled out as the cause of the fire, which began in a first-floor supply room full of flammable cleaning fluids.
In 1972, hotel company Hyatt began negotiations to purchase Recrion and its properties. However, Recrion soon canceled plans to sell the Stardust. Allen Glick, a San Diego developer, purchased the Stardust in 1974, using money borrowed from the Teamsters Union Pension Fund. Glick made the purchase through his company, Argent Corporation.

In 1975, concerns were raised that Argent executive Rosenthal was involved in the company&#x27;s casino operations, despite not being licensed. In May 1976, the Nevada Gaming Control Board launched an investigation into a slot cheating operation at the Stardust, possibly dating back to 1968. Dozens of former and current employees were questioned as the board sought to determine their involvement in the operation. The investigation soon widened to look at Argent&#x27;s other casino properties, leading to the discovery of a skimming operation at the resorts. It was among the city&#x27;s biggest skimming scandals. Jay Vandermark, the Stardust&#x27;s slot machine boss, oversaw the skimming. He disappeared once the operation was uncovered, and he was later presumed dead. Rosenthal was never charged in connection with the skimming.

By 1978, a special grand jury was formed to investigate organized crime connections with the Stardust. Glick grew tired of state and federal investigations regarding his casinos, and he announced in June 1978 that he would lease out and eventually sell the Stardust.

===Sachs and Tobman===
Sachs, along with Herb Tobman, took over operations in 1979, through a management contract with Glick. Tobman, like Sachs, had previously operated the Stardust years earlier. While Sachs and Tobman were handling operations again, Glick was negotiating to sell the resort to brothers Fred and Ed Doumani, although this did not proceed. An attorney for the Doumanis said that Argent had failed to provide necessary information to complete the sale. Glick eventually sold the Stardust to Sachs at the end of 1979.

Sachs was licensed by the state despite alleged affiliations with the Chicago mob. It was later discovered that Richard Bunker, the former chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, had withheld an investigative report from the board during Sachs&#x27; licensing. The report documented the 1970s skimming operation and concluded that Sachs had hired Rosenthal and Vandermark. However. Bunker said he withheld the report because the evidence of Sachs&#x27; involvement was actually inconclusive. Tobman would later become a co-owner of the Stardust, although he said that he was never required to be licensed.

In 1982, federal authorities accused Sachs and Tobman of providing skimmed money to the Chicago mob. On December 4, 1983, after a two-year investigation, the gaming commission ordered the suspension of the Stardust&#x27;s gaming license, using new emergency powers for the first time to remove casino management. An 18-count complaint was filed against Sachs and Tobman, stating that they failed to take appropriate action to stop this latest skimming operation, which totaled more than $1.5 million. The men themselves were not accused of skimming. Gaming officials sought a record $3.5 million fine for 222 alleged gaming violations. This latest investigation was part of an effort to remove Mafia figures from Nevada gaming operations. The Stardust had become infamous for its mob affiliations. A federal agent described it as &quot;the flagship of organized crime on the Strip&quot;.

Constellation Inc, led by a trio that included Bill Boyd, was chosen by the gaming control board to temporarily manage the casino. Sachs fought to regain control of the Stardust, but was rejected. In January 1984, he and Tobman agreed to sell the Stardust and pay the fines. A 130-day period was granted to keep the gaming license intact while the men tried to sell the resort. Meanwhile, a federal grand jury indicted five former Stardust employees for their role in the latest skimming operation. Trans-Sterling Inc, the resort&#x27;s operating company owned by Sachs and Tobman, was also indicted for its role. Charges against one of the five employees were later dismissed, due to a lack of conclusive evidence.

Several prospective buyers emerged for the Stardust, including William Morris, who owned the nearby Landmark hotel-casino. Wayne Newton was another candidate, and Sachs and Tobman ultimately chose him, although he encountered problems in acquiring the necessary funds. The gaming control board became concerned that Newton was chosen merely to delay the sale of the Stardust. The 130-day deadline passed without a sale. Sachs and Tobman filed a suit against the state, seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to maintain the gaming license. However, a judge ruled against them.

In September 1984, Sachs and Tobman alleged that Constellation had diverted revenue from the Stardust to benefit its other casinos. Meanwhile, four groups were in discussions to purchase the Stardust. Morris began negotiations with Imperial Palace owner Ralph Engelstad to become equal partners in a purchase of the Stardust. Stuart and Clifford S. Perlman were also in discussions to buy the resort.

California Hotel and Casinos, led by the Boyd family, agreed in November 1984 to purchase the Stardust. The sale was finalized on March 1, 1985. Meanwhile, Sachs and Tobman would make several attempts to reclaim the money that they paid in fines, stating that they were forced to sign a settlement with the state to sell the Stardust. Their efforts were unsuccessful, although the state did agree to pay Sachs $450,000, resolving a dispute over casino entertainment taxes.

===Later years===
The Boyd purchase helped to end the era of mob control in Las Vegas casinos. Prior to that point, Bill Boyd had never considered owning a Las Vegas Strip property. The Boyd family were surprised to see how profitable the Stardust actually was, now that skimming was no longer being practiced there. The Boyds introduced a personal style of customer service. According to Bill Boyd, &quot;When we took over the dealers weren&#x27;t even allowed to talk to customers. We&#x27;re more of a family-type company.&quot;
Steve Wynn&#x27;s new Mirage resort was opened in 1989. It marked the start of a building boom on the Las Vegas Strip, creating new competition for the Stardust. A 32-story hotel tower was added to the Stardust in 1990, and the resort saw its highest revenue in the mid-1990s, after the completion of the tower.

A robbery occurred at the Stardust in 1992, when two men used smoke bombs to steal $1.1 million from a guard, who was bringing the money to an armored truck. A former Stardust security guard was later arrested in connection with the robbery. Later in 1992, a Stardust sportsbook cashier covertly managed to steal $225,000 in cash and casino chips; he disappeared and was never apprehended by authorities.

A lengthy dispute, between the Stardust and a carpenters trade union, was settled in 1998. The Stardust carpenters had gone 11 years without a raise, and the National Labor Relations Board eventually filed a complaint against Boyd Gaming, which ultimately agreed to provide raises for the employees.

A murder occurred in the sportsbook in 2000, when one man shot another. The suspect, who was ultimately convicted of the murder, claimed that the victim was a mob enforcer sent to kill him.

In the late 1990s, Boyd Gaming delayed plans to redevelop the Stardust property, choosing instead to focus on its Borgata hotel-casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Stardust experienced weak revenue during 2001, and approximately 200 employees were laid off. The resort suffered further due to the economic impact of the September 11 attacks. In 2002, new projects were underway in the area around the Stardust, including a new resort by Wynn. As a result, Boyd Gaming announced that it was considering the construction of a new resort to replace the Stardust, although such plans were still years away from happening.

The Stardust celebrated its 45th anniversary in July 2003. Past entertainers at the resort were invited as VIPs for a celebration held there, and a time capsule was created for Stardust memorabilia. A new cocktail was also created and served at the Stardust to commemorate the anniversary. Bill Boyd said that the Stardust provided a retro experience for those seeking it, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s Old Las Vegas, and we have a lot of customers who enjoy the classic Las Vegas experience.&quot; However, the resort was no longer a top-earner for Boyd Gaming, and increased marketing of the resort failed to produce additional revenue. The Stardust site, consisting of , was considered a prime piece of land for redevelopment.

Future redevelopment possibilities would include the demolition of the Stardust for a new resort, or the construction of an adjacent resort on property located behind the Stardust. In 2004, Boyd Gaming purchased 13 acres of property located next to the Stardust, as part of its eventual redevelopment plans for the site. The property was occupied by a 639-room Budget Suites hotel. Revenue at the Stardust was helped by the opening of the nearby Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, but fell throughout 2006. In its final years, the Stardust struggled to attract younger customers and convention-goers.

===Closure and demolition===
On January 3, 2006, Boyd Gaming announced plans to close the Stardust within a year and replace it with a mixed-use project called Echelon Place, scheduled to open in 2010. Boyd Gaming planned to relocate some of the Stardust employees to other Boyd properties in Las Vegas. Some employees expressed sadness about the impending closure. Boyd announced on September 5, 2006, that the Stardust would close in two months. The closure was earlier than Boyd had expected, as some employees had left the resort early for new jobs, making it difficult to continue operations at the Stardust.

The Stardust closed on November 1, 2006. Gaming operations began to shut down that morning, followed by the full closure at 12:00 p.m. It was the largest resort to close on the Las Vegas Strip since the Sands Hotel and Casino in 1996. Long-time customers found the Stardust more personable compared to newer resorts, and they turned out in thousands for the resort&#x27;s final days. Bill Boyd said about employees, &quot;They&#x27;re leaving as if they&#x27;re losing their closest friends. That&#x27;s why we had such a great place: The employees were loyal and made our customers feel at home. The way Boyd Gaming operates, it&#x27;s much more of a family atmosphere than many other places.&quot;

The hotel was sold out for the final night before the closure. The Stardust had nearly 1,600 employees at the time, down about 200 from usual. Prior to the closure, a year had been spent cataloging more than 70,000 Stardust items to be auctioned off, including furniture, carpets, artwork, and palm trees. The five-day auction took place in the Stardust convention space a few weeks after the resort closed, and it attracted thousands of people.

Boyd Gaming had considered preserving the 32-story tower and incorporating it into the Echelon project, but the company decided that a completely vacant parcel of land would be better. The 32-story and 9-story hotel towers would be demolished through implosion; they were stripped of their interior to minimize debris, leaving behind only the concrete and steel that made up the buildings. This process took several months to complete. Demolition crews worked on a total of 27 Stardust structures in the months after the closure. Pipes, wires, and glass were removed from the property, along with of asbestos.

Smaller buildings were demolished in early 2007, and the two towers were imploded at 2:34 a.m. on March 13, 2007, after a four-minute fireworks show. Thousands of spectators watched the implosion from nearby areas. The towers contained more than 500,000 tons of concrete and steel, and it took more than 20 minutes for the resulting dust to disappear. The debris clean-up was expected to take two months. The implosion was overseen by Controlled Demolition, Inc., which had handled every prior resort implosion on the Las Vegas Strip. The 32-story tower is the tallest building to ever be imploded on the Strip.

===Redevelopment and legacy===

Boyd postponed the Echelon project in 2008, amid poor economic conditions caused by the Great Recession. In March 2013, Boyd sold the unfinished Echelon project to Genting Group, which planned to complete the project as a new property called Resorts World Las Vegas. It was initially expected to open in 2016, but was delayed several times because of design changes. It opened in June 2021, and includes an indoor sculpture depicting the Stardust&#x27;s roadside sign.

The Stardust name would continue to be used for other Boyd properties, including the Stardust Suite at the Orleans resort in Las Vegas, and the Stardust Event Center at the Blue Chip resort in Indiana. As of 2020, the Stardust name retains its wide name recognition, spanning across multiple generations and throughout the United States. Boyd Gaming, surprised by the brand&#x27;s lasting popularity, launched an online casino game in 2020 called &quot;Stardust Social Casino&quot;. In March 2021, Boyd partnered with FanDuel to create online casinos in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, under the Stardust name. They launched in April 2021, for Android and iOS computers.

==Architecture and design==
Construction on the Stardust began in the summer of 1954. There is no evidence an architect was hired to design the structure. Instead, it is likely that the general contractor, Donald R. Patterson, did the design. The five hotel wings were designed by engineer Tung-Yen Lin.

The Stardust was the largest hotel in the world when it opened, with 1,065 rooms. The rooms were located across six motel-like buildings, each named after a planet: Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Neptune, Saturn, and Venus. Parking was provided outside each building. The casino measured , and the resort interior featured rich red and deep brown coloring. The hotel included the Big Dipper swimming pool, measuring long and containing . It also featured the Stardust Drive-In movie theater, located behind the resort. It was originally called the Motor-Vu. It predated the Stardust&#x27;s opening, and was later replaced by the Budget Suites motel. The Stardust also had its own barbershop, which operated for more than 40 years, until the resort&#x27;s closure.

The Stardust took over the adjacent Royal Nevada hotel-casino in 1958, and joined it with the Stardust a year later. The casino, showroom, and restaurant at the Royal Nevada were converted into convention space and operated as the Stardust Auditorium. The Stardust heavily marketed its convention facilities. The Royal Nevada&#x27;s hotel also became part of the Stardust, providing additional rooms. In November 1959, construction began on an additional hotel building. The $1 million structure would be three stories high and contain 160 rooms, with completion expected within five months. The nine-story hotel tower was added in 1964.

The Stardust Country Club, located a few miles east of the resort, was added in 1961. The resort also owned and operated the off-site Stardust International Raceway, which held races from 1965 to 1968. The racetrack was created to attract high rollers to the resort. The track was located west of the resort, in an area that would later become Spring Valley, Nevada. When Parvin-Dohrmann purchased the Stardust in 1969, the company had little interest in the Stardust racetrack and soon sold it. The company also ended its lease of the golf course.

In 1967, the Stardust opened Horseman&#x27;s Park, which was located behind the resort and hosted horse events. It was the only horse show arena on the Las Vegas Strip. A 142-space RV park, called Camperland, was opened behind the hotel in 1972, on less than 10 acres. Stardust manager Al Sachs conceived the idea after realizing the high number of RV tourists in Las Vegas. The Stardust was the first resort on the Las Vegas Strip to offer an RV park, although other resort owners were skeptical that such a concept could work. Camperland included its own swimming pool, playground, and recreational hall. It was an immediate success, and plans were quickly announced to expand the site to 400 spaces. The Camperland expansion was completed in 1973, and plans were announced for a 17-story hotel tower, although it ultimately would not be until 1990 that the resort added a high-rise tower.

Under Argent&#x27;s ownership, the casino was enlarged and a sportsbook was added during 1975. Argent also sought approval to build a 19-story hotel tower. The first phase of a $70 million expansion was finished in July 1976. The casino, at , was the largest in the world according to Glick. Among the new features was an expanded sportsbook. Glick also still planned to add additional hotel rooms, which would be built behind the Stardust. Portions of the existing resort would have to be demolished to accommodate the proposed hotel expansion.

In 1981, the resort launched &quot;Stardust Line&quot;, a radio sports show that broadcast across the United States. It continued airing for the next 25 years. The Stardust sportsbook became popular across the United States in the late 1980s, after being featured in various media such as television news and magazines. The sportsbook offered Las Vegas&#x27; first line in betting, and was popular among professional bettors. The sportsbook offered unique betting rules during its peak, before adopting a more conventional approach in 1991. During its final decade, the Stardust offered a popular head-to-head football handicapping contest, held each Friday night. The sportsbook also allowed betting on any kind of sport.

After taking ownership, the Boyds spent $6 million on room renovations, and plans were announced in 1986 for another $26 million in renovations. A $50 million renovation project was finished in 1987, adding a shopping mall and other features, including a new resort entrance. The renovation also added the Olde-Tyme Gambling Museum, featuring antique slot machines.
The Stardust was one of the few Strip properties without a high-rise hotel tower, and there were plans to eventually add one. In early 1990, construction was underway on the 32-story tower and a conference center. The RV park closed that year to make room for the expansion. The first 700 rooms of the tower were opened on December 21, 1990, along with the conference center. The tower faced southwest to northeast, and the exterior featured horizontal, red-colored neon lights, located in between each floor. During the 1990s, the Stardust had its own in-house direct marketing department, an uncommon feature for a hotel-casino.

By 1997, there were plans to remodel and expand the Stardust. A $9 million renovation of the Stardust suites took place in 1998, and plans were announced for a separate $24 million renovation project. The latter would include new signs, and minor remodeling of hotel rooms and the casino. The project was underway in 1999, with improvements being made to the façade.

By the end of 1999, demolition was set to begin soon on the remaining 537 hotel rooms left from the resort&#x27;s opening in 1958. The rooms were contained across four motel buildings, each of them two stories in height. Boyd Gaming considered using the property for an expansion of the Stardust convention facilities. In 2001, despite fears of an economic slowdown, Boyd Gaming announced plans to expand its convention space. The new Stardust Pavilion and Exhibit Center would add , and would be built next to the existing conference center, which had .

At the time of its closure, the Stardust was among the smallest resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, with 1,552 rooms, and an casino. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the resort went from being &quot;the world&#x27;s largest hotel to one of the smallest on the Strip, from glamour to infamy to middle-class normalcy.&quot; The Stardust primarily catered to a middle class clientele for much of its history, and at the time of its closing, it was one of the few remaining Strip resorts to still offer affordable amenities; newer resorts were becoming increasingly upscale.

===Signs===

The 1958 Stardust façade sign was long and high, wrapping around two sides of the building, and was lit with of neon tubing and 11,000 incandescent bulbs. It weighed , contained of wiring, and drew 3,000 amps. At the bend in the sign was a diameter plastic model of the Earth. Cosmic rays of neon and electric light bulbs beamed from behind the model Earth in all directions. Three-dimensional acrylic glass planets spun alongside 20 sparkling neon starbursts. Across the universe was a jagged galaxy of electric lettering spelling out &quot;Stardust&quot;. The &quot;S&quot; alone contained 975 lamps. At night, the neon constellation was reportedly visible from over away. The façade signage was designed by Kermit Wayne.

In 1968 the hotel&#x27;s appearance underwent a major change. A roadside sign, designed by Paul Miller of the Ad Art Company, was installed in February 1968. It was 188 feet tall and 93 feet wide, and was among the most popular neon signs in Las Vegas. That April, the hotel&#x27;s façade was rebuilt according to a design by Raymond Larson of YESCO.

In 1977, the façade was revamped to remove the space theme and signage, instead adding a series of blue and magenta mirror panels along the front of the resort. The Stardust&#x27;s roadside sign was retained, although its lettering was eventually replaced with the Helvetica font in 1991. The original lettering was given to the city&#x27;s Neon Museum, and was eventually refurbished in 2020. The Stardust roadside sign was dismantled in February 2007, and was also given to the Neon Museum. A 56-foot-wide sign, for the property&#x27;s &quot;Lido de Paris&quot; show, was also acquired by the museum and added to its tour in 2023.

===Restaurants===
Aku Aku, a Polynesian restaurant, opened on the Stardust property in January 1960. However, a fire occurred in the restaurant&#x27;s attic just days after the opening, and the nearby casino was briefly closed because of smoke. Natural gas was the cause of the fire. Aku Aku reopened several weeks later. The restaurant included a tiki bar and a large stone tiki head (moai) marking the entrance from the outside. Another new restaurant, the Plantation Kitchen, was opened in 1966. The Palm Room restaurant was renovated in 1969, and a new restaurant was added in 1975.

Aku Aku closed in 1980, and one of the moai heads was relocated to an island pond at Sunset Park, located in the Las Vegas Valley. Various restaurants were added during the renovations in the late 1980s, including a Tony Roma&#x27;s, and William B&#x27;s Steakhouse, named after Bill Boyd. A 340-seat buffet and a Japanese restaurant were added in the late 1990s, as part of the resort&#x27;s latest renovations. As of 2002, the Stardust had five restaurants, including Tony Roma&#x27;s.
==Shows and entertainers==
When the Stardust opened in 1958, it included the Cafe Continental dinner showroom, which had seating for 700 people. It included a rising stage capable of sinking below and rising above the floor. The stage was billed as larger than a basketball court, held a swimming tank and ice skating rink, and was capable of generating rain and snow on demand. Topless showgirls performed on opening night in &quot;Lido de Paris&quot;, a show imported from France. The Las Vegas version ran at the Stardust for several decades. When it premiered, the production cost $250,000.

Valerie Perrine was a showgirl in &quot;Lido de Paris&quot; in the late 1960s. In addition to showgirls, &quot;Lido de Paris&quot; also featured comedy and live animals. Siegfried &amp; Roy, along with their animals, were among performers in the show during the 1970s. Other notable performers at the Stardust included Tim Conway, Harvey Korman, Phyllis Diller, Robert Goulet, Don Rickles, Billy Daniels, Chicago, Steve and Eydie, The Temptations, the Four Tops, George Carlin, Bobby Berosini, Andrew Dice Clay, and Bob Newhart.

Aside from the main showroom, the Stardust also had entertainers perform in its lounge, which was expanded in 1969. The lounge, present since the resort&#x27;s opening, was replaced with new casino space during renovations in 1975. The $1 million, 650-seat Starlight theater lounge was opened on October 1, 1976, replacing the one that had closed a year earlier. According to the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; in 1977, Argent Corporation &quot;took out the best lounge in town at the Stardust, replaced it with a mini-main showroom, treated it as a lounge, over priced it, then closed it.&quot; The Starlight Lounge reopened at the end of 1977.
&quot;Lido de Paris&quot; continued to run until 1991, when it was replaced by a modernized show that also featured topless showgirls. The new show was part of an effort by Boyd Group to modernize the Stardust. Another reason for the original show&#x27;s closure was the high cost of production. &quot;Lido de Paris&quot; ran for more than 32 years, putting on 22,000 performances. The new show, &quot;Enter the Night&quot;, opened in July 1991. The show was updated with new costumes and cast members in 1997, and figure skater Dorothy Hamill briefly performed in the show during 1998. Thunder from Down Under, a male revue, did several shows at the Stardust in the 1990s.

In October 1999, the Stardust hired Wayne Newton as its resident headliner for a reported $25 million per year. Newton would perform in the 920-seat Stardust Theater, which would be renamed the Wayne Newton Theater. &quot;Enter the Night&quot; ended in December 1999, and Newton began performing in the same theater space a month later. Newton helped to keep the Stardust competitive during its final years. Bob Anderson performed at the Stardust in 2000, and began a three-month residency two years later, in the Starlight Lounge. Gene Pitney made his Las Vegas Strip debut at the Stardust in 2003, and hypnotist Anthony Cools began a six-month run at the resort that year.

&quot;Havana Night Club&quot; premiered at the Stardust in 2004, featuring more than 50 Cuban dancers, musicians, and singers, It was directed by Kenny Ortega, and co-produced by Siegfried &amp; Roy. The show previously premiered in 1999 and toured around the world, but the Las Vegas version was modified extensively by Ortega, who spent a year working on it. The show&#x27;s Las Vegas debut was postponed because of issues concerning travel visas, and the Stardust briefly considered hiring a replacement act. &quot;Havana Night Club&quot; eventually opened in August 2004, after a three-week delay.

Magician Rick Thomas began performing at the Stardust in March 2005, and Newton ended his show a month later, saying that he wanted to move on. Newton&#x27;s commitment to USO tours was a factor in his Stardust departure. Steve and Eydie were the final entertainers to perform at the Stardust, on October 28, 2006.

*&quot;&quot;, written by Nicholas Pileggi, chronicles the period when the Stardust and other casinos were run by Frank Rosenthal and Anthony Spilotro on behalf of the Chicago and Kansas City Mafia during the 1970s and early 1980s.
*&quot;The Odds: One Season, Three Gamblers and the Death of Their Las Vegas&quot;, by Chad Millman, chronicles a year in the lives of Stardust race and sportsbook manager Joe Lupo and assistant manager Bob Scucci, as well as professional sports bettor Alan Boston and wannabe sports bettor Rodney Bosnich. The Stardust was chosen due to its status at the time as the &quot;home of the opening line&quot;.
*&quot;The Stardust of Yesterday: Reflections on a Las Vegas Legend&quot;, written by Heidi Knapp Rinella and edited by Mike Weatherford, is a complete history of the hotel and casino. Rinella and Weatherford were staff writers for the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;. Siegfried &amp; Roy provided the book&#x27;s foreword, sharing their many memories of the resort.

=== Onscreen ===
In 1977, Rosenthal debuted a live talk show that was taped inside the Stardust. The resort was also a regular filming location for the 1980s television series &quot;Crime Story&quot;. The Stardust sign makes brief appearances in the music video for &quot;House of Mystic Lights&quot;, a 1988 song by C. C. Catch. Several films were shot at the Stardust in the 1990s, including &quot;Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Showgirls&quot;, and &quot;Swingers&quot;.

&quot;Casino&quot;, the 1995 film adaptation of Pileggi&#x27;s book, features two characters who are largely based on Rosenthal and Spilotro. The casino&#x27;s name was changed for legal purposes, from the Stardust to the &quot;Tangiers Hotel and Casino&quot;. However, snippets of the Hoagy Carmichael song &quot;Stardust&quot; can be heard on the soundtrack, giving a subtle hint as to the casino&#x27;s true identity.

In the film &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; (1996), the Stardust’s neon sign can be seen in the background.

The Stardust was a filming location for the 1998 film &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, in which it is portrayed as the fictional Bazooko Circus casino. Subsequent films shot at the Stardust include &quot;The Debtors&quot; and &quot;Pasty Faces&quot;. The resort was also featured in commercials for Miller Lite and Aflac, during the early 2000s. A television pilot for a failed reality show, titled &quot;So You Wanna Be an Actor&quot;, was shot at the Stardust in September 2006, becoming the last production project to shoot there.

<doc id="742341" wikidata="Q4866457" url="?curid=742341" title="1945 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting">
<text>Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1945 included the first regular election conducted in three years and a strong response to criticism of the slow pace of honors. The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent players, and elected no one. The Old Timers Committee responded by electing the biggest class yet, ten people. The selections by the Committee, announced in April 1945, were: Roger Bresnahan, Dan Brouthers, Fred Clarke, Jimmy Collins, Ed Delahanty, Hugh Duffy, Hughie Jennings, King Kelly, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, and Wilbert Robinson.

After the baseball centennial and grand opening of the Hall of Fame in 1939, the BBWAA had determined to vote only every third year. After electing three players that year, it elected one in 1942 and none in 1945. New rules now provided that the writers would return to voting on recent players annually.

==1944 background==
In response to increasing complaints that the stars of the 19th century were being ignored, commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis had in August 1944 enlarged the Hall of Fame Committee from four members to seven. He had instructed them to elect a minimum of 10 players from the 1876–1900 period when they met as the Old-Timers Committee in early 1945—a goal the committee members believed would be relatively easy to meet, as some among them stated that the number of qualified candidates was likely over two dozen. After Landis&#x27; death in November 1944, the committee met briefly and elected Landis to the Hall of Fame. They also suggested that if the January 1945 election by the BBWAA failed to select any players whose careers extended into the initial years of the 20th century, some would be selected by the committee when they met in February.

==BBWAA election==
Members of the BBWAA again had the authority to select any players active in the 20th century (after 1900), provided they had not appeared in a major league game in 1944. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall.

A total of 247 ballots were cast, with 2,362 individual votes for 95 specific candidates, an average of 9.56 per ballot; 186 votes were required for election. The results were announced on January 28, 1945. The emphasis on the players of the 1900s and 1910s, who many voters felt should be given priority, again continued to increase beyond the levels seen in 1939 and 1942. Only five of the top 22 candidates in the voting, and none of the top six, had seen any substantial play since 1917; only three of the top 36, and none of the top 22, had played their final season anytime between 1918 and 1933. Eight of the top 13 candidates were deceased. Players who had been retired over 27 years – 48 of the 94 named – received 72% of the votes.

For the first time in the three BBWAA elections, no candidate received at least 75% of the vote. Particularly since the next election was not scheduled to be held until 1948, that a new generation of players was quickly becoming eligible, and that increasingly fractured voting patterns would make selections more improbable, criticism became widespread that the election system needed to be reviewed and quickly revised; it was suggested that the Old-Timers Committee might select some of the earliest popular candidates to help clear the top of the ballot. At its September 1945 meeting, the Hall of Fame Committee ordered that the three-year wait between elections be abolished, and that annual elections resume under a revised format.

Candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;; players chosen by the Old-Timers Committee in 1945 are marked with an asterisk (*).


==Old-Timers Committee==
In response to the failure of the BBWAA to select any inductees, the Old-Timers Committee was encouraged to assist the BBWAA in clearing the congestion at the top of its ballot by including, among their 10 requested selections from the period 1876–1900, some players whose careers extended into the early 20th century – in particular, the three players gaining over 100 votes in the BBWAA election whose careers had peaked before 1905.

The committee members were: Hall of Fame president Stephen C. Clark, who chaired the committee; Hall of Fame treasurer Paul S. Kerr, the committee secretary; Yankees president Ed Barrow; Athletics owner/manager Connie Mack; New York sportswriter Sid Mercer; Braves president Bob Quinn; and Boston sportswriter Mel Webb. The committee had initially planned to meet in February; but the long search for a successor to Landis, along with the retirements of Barrow and Quinn as club presidents, delayed the meeting until April 25, one day after Albert &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler was elected as the new commissioner. On that day, in the offices of the New York Yankees, six members of the committee met to make their selections; Sid Mercer could not attend due to a long illness which took his life 8 weeks later.

===Selections===
The committee, as requested, selected 10 inductees, the first three by unanimous vote:

*Fred Clarke, a left fielder, primarily with the Pittsburgh Pirates, from 1894 to 1911; he compiled a .312 career batting average, and also led the team to four pennants in 16 seasons as manager, as well as the 1909 World Series title. He retired in 1915 with a major league record 1602 career wins as a manager.
*Jimmy Collins, widely regarded as the greatest third baseman in the major leagues&#x27; first 70 years; he batted over .300 five times, finishing with a .294 average, and also managed the Boston Americans to a victory in the first World Series in 1903.
*Wilbert Robinson, a catcher for 17 seasons; he caught a record 1108 games before 1900. He later served as the New York Giants&#x27; pitching coach for 11 years, then managed Brooklyn for 18 seasons, winning two pennants; upon his retirement, his win total as a manager trailed those of only John McGraw and Clarke in National League history.
*Roger Bresnahan, often regarded as the game&#x27;s best catcher of the 1900s, and described by both McGraw and Branch Rickey as the greatest catcher they had ever seen; in 1907 he became the first major league catcher to wear shinguards, and was a capable player at every position. He was fast enough to bat leadoff, and remains the only catcher to steal over 200 bases in his career. He managed the Cardinals and Cubs for a total of five seasons, and was later a coach with the Giants and Tigers.
*Dan Brouthers, a star first baseman from 1879 to 1896 who won five batting titles (a 19th-century record) and retired with a .342 career average; the game&#x27;s greatest power hitter of the 1880s, he was the only 19th century player to have a career slugging percentage over .500. He later became a scout for the Giants.
*Ed Delahanty, a left fielder from 1888 to 1903, and the sport&#x27;s greatest slugger of the 1890s, batting over .400 three times; he won batting titles in both leagues and had a .346 career average. He hit four home runs in one game in 1896, and had a 31-game hitting streak in 1899. He died at age 35 in 1903 when he fell from a bridge into the Niagara River after being put off a train.
*Hugh Duffy, a center fielder from 1888 to 1905 who starred primarily with the Boston Beaneaters; his .438 batting average in 1894 remains the major league record for a single season, and he retired with a career average of .324. Perhaps the best defensive outfielder of the era, as well as the first recognized triple crown winner, he later became a hitting coach for the Red Sox for a number of years, tutoring the young Ted Williams.
*Hughie Jennings, the fiery shortstop and team captain of the Baltimore Orioles in the 1890s; he batted .401 in 1896 and retired with a .311 average. He later managed the Tigers from 1907 to 1920, winning pennants in his first three years; he left the Tigers trailing only Connie Mack and Clark Griffith in career wins among AL managers. Afterward, he was a coach for the Giants on four consecutive pennant winners.
*Mike &quot;King&quot; Kelly, who starred as an outfielder and catcher with several teams from 1878 to 1893, and was an extraordinary baserunner; he led the Chicago White Stockings to 5 pennants in the 1880s, and retired with a .308 batting average. He was always aware of the loopholes in the official rules, and some prominent figures in the game estimated that half of all the rules in baseball had been created in response to his exploiting their oversights. Along with manager-teammate Cap Anson, he is often credited with devising the hit-and-run and the double steal.
*Jim O&#x27;Rourke, an outfielder from 1872 to 1893, and one of the game&#x27;s earliest stars, played for six pennant winners in the 1870s. Along with Cap Anson, he was one of two players to collect over 2000 hits in the major leagues before 1893; he later played in the minor leagues until he was past 50.

Of the 10 selections, only Clarke and Duffy were still living. The committee intended to consider the pitchers of the era at their next meeting in September, and to elect additional members at that time. When they met in Cooperstown on September 6, however, they focused instead on revising the widely criticized election process, and ordered that the BBWAA resume annual elections under a revised format which was hoped to facilitate more selections (the BBWAA having selected only one player in six years). Former National League president John Heydler participated in the meeting to replace those members who were deceased or otherwise unable to attend. Once the decision was made to hold the next election in 1946 rather than in 1948, the committee agreed to postpone the selection of pitchers and other candidates until they met in spring 1946.

===Other candidates===
Among those candidates who were not elected by the Old-Timers Committee at their April 1945 meeting, there were five who received particularly strong support or attention:
*The committee chose not to consider Clark Griffith and Charles &quot;Kid&quot; Nichols until pitchers were more completely reviewed at their next meeting.
*Popular support to elect recently deceased President Franklin Roosevelt, in recognition of his support for baseball&#x27;s continuation for morale purposes during World War II, was met with uncertainty on the committee&#x27;s part as to whether they had the authority to elect someone who was never a major league player, manager or executive. They opted to seek advice on this point before taking action in his case.
*The candidacy of Abner Doubleday, based on his supposed invention of baseball at Cooperstown in 1839, had become more controversial due to increasing skepticism regarding the historical basis for that belief. It was widely believed that the committee intended to seek further information either supporting or refuting the story before taking action.
*There was support for electing Jim &quot;Deacon&quot; White, a star catcher and third baseman of the 1870s and 1880s; but after choosing several candidates from the turn of the century and adding three stars of the 1880s, the committee had fulfilled its initial obligation of 10 selections and chose to postpone further choices until meeting again.

===Criticism and rationale===
Although the committee&#x27;s selections were roundly applauded at the time, in later years many baseball historians and writers came to believe strongly that the committee erred in some of its 1945 selections, and that too many individuals had been elected; however, this view does not consider the fact that the committee had been &quot;required&quot; to select 10 inductees that year. There are also several factors which make the reasons for their choices clearly discernible:
#After the failed BBWAA election, the committee was primarily focused on assisting the BBWAA in relieving the congestion at the top of its ballot, and was encouraged to select some players who had played into the early 20th century and were receiving support in the BBWAA vote. Therefore, their selections that year tended to strongly favor the period between 1893 (when baseball moved the pitcher back 10 feet from the plate) and 1910; all ten of their selections were active players in 1893 or later, and seven were active after 1900.
#Of all the non-pitchers who had retired before 1910, only 5 had received more than 2 votes (1% of the vote) in the 1945 BBWAA election: Jimmy Collins (121), Ed Delahanty (111), Hughie Jennings (92), Wilbert Robinson (81) and Hugh Duffy (64). All five were stars prior to 1900, with only Collins playing regularly after 1903, and each had received over 25% of the BBWAA vote; every other non-pitcher retired before 1910 who had &quot;ever&quot; received over 2% of the BBWAA vote had already been elected. The committee elected all five, and criticism of any of these choices is more appropriately directed at the BBWAA voters who supported their selection, as the Old-Timers Committee was acting simply out of agreement with their vote.
#The committee apparently made an attempt to elect players at positions which were not yet represented in the Hall; by 1945, the BBWAA had elected 20th century players at every position except catcher, third base and left field. The committee&#x27;s election of Jimmy Collins corrected the absence of a third baseman, as he was generally regarded as the game&#x27;s greatest player at the position to that time and had consistently finished first among third basemen in the BBWAA voting, usually outpolling the combined totals of all others at the position. His career spanned the years 1894 to 1908, easily allowing him to be considered a star in both centuries. The committee&#x27;s choices at the other two positions also followed the BBWAA vote closely. Catcher Roger Bresnahan had finished first among catchers in most of the BBWAA elections, with only the recently retired Mickey Cochrane competing for the top spot. In the voting since 1937, Fred Clarke had trailed only Ed Delahanty – who died in 1903 – among left fielders. Both Bresnahan and Clarke were stars of the 1900s who had made their major league debuts in the 1890s, making them eligible for selection by the Old-Timers.
#Among most of those following the elections, there was very strong sentiment to choose players who had remained in the sport as managers, coaches or executives after retiring. Eight of the selections were major league managers at some point, with five (Clarke, Collins, Jennings, King Kelly and Robinson) leading their teams to pennants. Bresnahan, Jennings and Robinson each served at least five seasons as coaches in the major leagues, and Duffy worked as a scout for many years. With the elections of Clarke, Robinson and Jennings, 5 of the 9 retired managers with over 1000 wins were now in the Hall (as well as the still-active Connie Mack), with Clark Griffith&#x27;s candidacy deferred. There were 14 managers with at least 1000 wins before 1945; all have since been elected, the last being Frank Selee in 1999.
#There was a strong emphasis on those who had played central roles on championship teams, particularly the three-time champion Baltimore Orioles of 1894-95-96 which were regarded by many as the greatest baseball dynasty of the 19th century; Dan Brouthers, Jennings and Robinson were all regulars on that team, with Jennings also playing for a later Brooklyn champion and Brouthers starring for 3 earlier champions. Bresnahan had starred on the 1905 New York Giants; Collins was the playing manager of the 1903 Boston Americans, and a star player for two NL champions of the late 1890s; Duffy starred on 5 pennant winners in Boston in the 1890s; and Clarke was the playing manager of 4 pennant winners in Pittsburgh. Kelly and Jim O&#x27;Rourke each starred on several pennant winners in the era before 1893. Of the 10 selections, 8 had been a starting player and/or manager on at least four pennant winners.

<doc id="742343" wikidata="Q6302616" url="?curid=742343" title="Judge Parker">
<text>Judge Parker is an American soap opera-style comic strip created by Nicholas P. Dallis that first appeared on November 24, 1952. The strip&#x27;s look and content were influenced by the work of Allen Saunders and Ken Ernst on &quot;Mary Worth&quot;.

==Characters and story==
Alan Parker was a widower and a judge with two children, Randy and Ann. Later, Judge Parker married a younger woman, Katherine. Initially a dashing figure who solved crimes and chased criminals, Parker became an upstanding and serious judge who rarely strayed from his courtroom during the 1960s. Instead, the spotlight began to focus on handsome, successful young attorney Sam Driver, and Parker was almost entirely phased out of his own strip.

The strip is set in the community of Cavelton. Most stories revolve around Driver, his wealthy client and now-wife Abbey Spencer, and their two adopted children: volatile Neddy and her traumatized younger sister, Sophie. The family lives with their maid Marie at Spencer Farms, where Abbey raises Arabian horses. Some of the cast may not be seen for some time because &quot;Judge Parker&quot; stories tend to be long; an apparent week in the plot may last for months in publication time. Alan&#x27;s son Randy, now grown, is Driver&#x27;s law partner, and a 2006 storyline focused on Randy&#x27;s campaign for the judicial seat from which his father is retiring, ensuring that the &quot;Judge Parker&quot; name will continue. The February 15, 2009, strip stated that Randy would be &quot;the new Judge Parker.&quot; On April 4, 2023, Neddy&#x27;s friend Veronica Peña married Katherine Bryson.

==Artists==

Dallis, a psychiatrist who also created the comic strips &quot;Apartment 3-G&quot; and &quot;Rex Morgan, M.D.&quot;, used the pen name &quot;Paul Nichols&quot; when writing the strip. Shortly before his death, he retired in 1990, turning over the scripting chores to his assistant Woody Wilson.

The strip&#x27;s first artist was Dan Heilman, who left in 1965 and was replaced by Harold LeDoux. Under LeDoux, the characters gradually (and gracefully) aged. LeDoux&#x27;s last strip ran on May 28, 2006.

Comic book artist Eduardo Barreto replaced him; his first strip appeared the following day. Barreto suffered a near-fatal injury in a car accident in Uruguay shortly afterwards and was unable to illustrate the strips for December 2006; as a result, &quot;Rex Morgan&quot; artist Graham Nolan did the strip for a week, and John Heebink took over the following week. Barreto resumed drawing the strip in January 2007. Barreto fell &quot;gravely ill&quot; from meningitis in early February 2010 and had to withdraw from drawing the strip for &quot;the foreseeable future&quot;. Barreto&#x27;s son Diego drew the strip for the week beginning February 8, 2010, with John Heebink stepping in again on February 15, 2010, for four weeks while Barreto recovered.

Artist Mike Manley assumed the art duties permanently, beginning with the strip for March 15, 2010. Initially announced as another fill-in artist, Manley revealed on February 23, 2010, that he&#x27;d been given the ongoing assignment. The syndicate held a &quot;two-man tryout&quot;, with Manley being offered the full-time job over Heebink after Manley turned in his second week of art for the strip. Following Woody Wilson&#x27;s retirement, Francesco Marciuliano became writer as of August 22, 2016. Marciuliano has given the strip a darker tone.

<text>The Hacienda was a hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, that operated from 1956 to 1996. It was opened by Warren Bayley, who owned other Hacienda properties in California as well. Bayley opened the hotel portion in June 1956, although the opening of the casino was delayed as the Nevada Gaming Control Board objected to his choice of casino manager, Jake Kozloff. The casino portion eventually opened on October 17, 1956. The $6 million property had 266 rooms and the largest pool on the Las Vegas Strip. Like its sister properties in California, the resort included a neon sign that depicted a cowboy riding a palomino horse.

The Hacienda was built at the south end of the Strip, making it the first resort to be seen by tourists driving up from California. The Hacienda was located by itself at the time, a distance away from other resorts. Because of its location, most guests did not bother to visit the other resorts. The Hacienda was the first Las Vegas resort to target a family clientele, and until 1962, it operated a plane service to fly in guests from out of state.

When Bayley died in 1964, his wife Judy Bayley took over the Hacienda. At the time, she was the only female casino owner in Las Vegas. She died in 1971, and the resort was sold to a group of investors, who added an RV park for guests. The Hacienda was sold entirely to Paul Lowden, a part owner, in 1977. The Hacienda hosted several ice-skating shows starting in the 1970s, and would later host Lance Burton in a magic show that ran for five years. The Little Church of the West was relocated onto the Hacienda property in 1979, and 11-story hotel towers were added in 1980 and 1991, for a total of 1,137 rooms.

Circus Circus Enterprises purchased the Hacienda in 1995, with plans to build a new resort in its place. The Hacienda closed on December 1, 1996, and the hotel was imploded at the end of the month as part of a televised New Year&#x27;s Eve special. The last portions of the hotel were demolished in January 1997. Circus Circus Enterprises opened the Mandalay Bay resort on the site in 1999, and the Hacienda name was licensed to another property, the Hacienda Hotel and Casino, near Boulder City, Nevada. The neon horse sign was preserved and put on display in downtown Las Vegas.

== History ==
===Construction and opening===
The Hacienda initially began as a hotel-casino project called Lady Luck, which was being planned by Carlton Adair in 1954. Adair had several partners in the project, including Stanley Burke, a Sacramento man who owned the land. Adair also brought in Warren &quot;Doc&quot; Bayley, a travel columnist and owner of several Hacienda motels in Fresno, Bakersfield, and Indio, California. Under the deal, Adair and his group would have interest in the casino, while Burke would own the land and buildings. Bayley would be in charge of the hotel portion. The owners hoped to have the project finished before the opening of the Tropicana resort down the street.

The Lady Luck project received approval from the Clark County Planning Commission in January 1955, and construction was underway later that year. The project struggled to get investors, and its financing fell apart before construction reached the halfway mark. Bayley took over the project, renamed it the Hacienda, and removed Adair, leaving only Bayley and Burke. Bayley agreed to lease the property for $55,000 per month for 15 years.

The Hacienda was designed by Homer A. Rissman, and was built like other Las Vegas properties at the time, with a central building for the casino and restaurants, and motel structures to provide lodging. Rissman designed the project so that each motel building would connect to the casino via glass-walled corridors. Before it opened, the Hacienda included a 300-seat dining theater. Because of the high cost for performers, the Hacienda owners decided to refocus the space on hosting conventions rather than live entertainment, which instead would be offered in a lounge.

The hotel portion opened in June 1956. Because Bayley and Burke lacked casino experience, they chose Jake Kozloff, a Las Vegas casino investor, to manage the gaming operations. However, the Hacienda was denied a gaming license, as the Nevada Gaming Control Board was opposed to Kozloff&#x27;s involvement because of past activities. A gaming license was issued after Kozloff was removed from the project, and the casino eventually opened on October 17, 1956. The $6 million Hacienda had 266 rooms and the largest swimming pool on the Las Vegas Strip. Like the other Hacienda hotels, the Las Vegas property featured a roadsign neon sign that depicted a cowboy riding a palomino horse. It was designed by YESCO and was among the company&#x27;s most popular signs.

The Hacienda was built on the south end of the Las Vegas Strip, making it the first resort to be seen by motor tourists arriving from California. It sat alone at the time, surrounded by desert and away from the other resorts on the Strip. Gaming executives initially predicted that the Hacienda would struggle due to its location, although the resort prospered for many years. Its remote location ensured that most guests stayed on the property rather than visiting other resorts. The Hacienda was also popular because of its location near the McCarran International Airport, although the resort never had the same success as other Strip properties such as the Dunes and the Sands. Because it lacked the same elegance as other resorts on the Strip, the Hacienda received the negative nickname &quot;Hayseed Heaven&quot;. The Hacienda was built as a budget resort and was the first Las Vegas resort aimed at attracting families. It included a go-cart track and a miniature golf course for children, and Las Vegas&#x27; first par 3 golf course. It also offered the Palomino room, which was used for shows and small parties.

In 1957, a few months after the opening, Kozloff filed a writ of attachment against the Hacienda, alleging that he was owed $71,000 from a loan he made to the property. The hotel posted a bond which nullified the writ. Three months later, Burke made various allegations against Bayley and requested that the Hacienda be placed into receivership. Bayley denied the allegations, which included a claim that he had mishandled finances. Later that year, plans were being made to add additional hotel rooms.

===Promotion===
Bayley devised numerous ideas to promote the resort. Shortly after its opening, he formed Hacienda Airlines, offering packages that included transportation from Los Angeles to the Hacienda as well as a room and some casino chips. The airline service proved to be successful, prompting Bayley to increase the number of planes. Its success was attributed to low fares, frequent advertising in California, and its catering to working-class tourists. The service would later extend to other U.S. cities. The airline included DC-3s, DC-4s and Lockheed Constellations, eventually numbering as many as 30 aircraft. One plane included a piano bar with actor Dick Winslow, who provided musical entertainment during the ride. The flights also offered champagne, and featured young women modeling lingerie for the passengers, who were mostly men. By the end of 1960, the Hacienda had flown in 150,000 people, making it the largest consumer of California champagne.

The flights eventually stopped in 1962, following an order from the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The agency alleged that the Hacienda was operating as an airline, and the resort was not licensed to provide such service. The Hacienda denied this and stated that its guests were flown in for free, saying that they paid only for food and a hotel room. However, because guests paid before boarding the plane, CAB determined that they were essentially paying for a plane fare.
The resort also offered the Hacienda Holiday, a promotional program for tourists in which $10 casino chips were given away as part of a $16 package deal. In 1958, the Clark County licensing board ordered the Hacienda to halt this program, objecting to the fact that the chips were redeemable in the casino. The board said that these chips could be used for other services, but it was opposed to their use in the casino, stating that this would promote gambling. The promotion would be offered for at least the next 20 years, eventually becoming the Hacienda Champagne Holiday.

From December 1958 to February 1959, the Hacienda sponsored a flight endurance record when two men took turns flying a Cessna 172 across the southwestern United States for a period of 64 days. However, the promotion did not turn out as planned. Newspapers did not report on the story until 30 days after the plane took off, and they declined to mention the Hacienda. Dick Taylor, the Hacienda&#x27;s general manager, said, &quot;The papers, detecting a publicity stunt, did what they felt they had to do. They deleted the Hacienda name from all reports, and even went so far as to blank out the Hacienda name that was painted so large along the side of the plane.&quot;

===Ownership changes===
Bayley died of a heart attack in 1964, and his widow, Judith Bayley, took over the Hacienda. At the time, Bayley was the only female casino owner in Las Vegas, earning her a nickname as the &quot;First Lady of Gambling&quot;. She lacked business training, and found the casino operation to be more complicated than initially expected. She lost hundreds of dollars in her first few months. Under her management, the Hacienda offered shuffleboard and babysitting services for guests, maintaining its appeal as a family resort. A lounge, known as the Jewel Box, was remodeled and reopened in 1965, followed by the opening of a keno room. Las Vegas mayor Oran Gragson attended both openings. One county commissioner had opposed the keno addition, stating that it would add a &quot;honky tonk&quot; atmosphere that was common in the city&#x27;s Fremont Street area. In 1966, the Clark County Commission threatened to shut down the Hacienda unless Bayley made improvements to a resort that her company was building at Mount Charleston.

To focus on the Las Vegas Hacienda, Bayley sold off the California hotels in 1970, with the exception of one located in El Segundo. In December 1971, Judy Bayley died of cancer at the age of 56. Bayley&#x27;s estate left the Hacienda to her assistant Joan Rashbrook and lawyer Calvin Magleby. Several weeks after Bayley&#x27;s death, Magleby announced that American Mining and Smelting Inc. would purchase the Hacienda, with plans for expansion and remodeling of the resort. However, the sale was never completed. Later in 1972, the Hacienda was sold for $5 million to a group of buyers, which included Allen R. Glick, Paul Lowden, and Eugene Fresch. Lowden had raised $250,000 to purchase a 15-percent interest in the property, and he also became the resort&#x27;s entertainment director.

In 1973, the Hacienda began construction on Travel World, an adjacent RV park for its guests. In 1974, the Hacienda became part of Glick&#x27;s company, Argent Corporation, which held a controlling interest. Fresch and Lowden also retained interests. The 452-space RV park, later called Ramada Camp Inn, was opened in 1975. It was part of a $7 million renovation of the resort. In 1976, Argent announced that it would sell the Hacienda for $21 million to Hawaiian businessman Joseph Gennitti, who would also take over $11 million in debt. The deal ended after Gennitti failed to provide Glick with details about financing the purchase. Subsequently, two opposing investment groups began negotiations to purchase the Hacienda. Later that year, state investigators found that money had been skimmed from slot machines at Glick&#x27;s casinos, including the Hacienda.

In January 1977, it was announced that Lowden, the hotel&#x27;s president, would purchase the remaining interest from Argent and Fresch for $21 million. Lowden worked with several individuals to raise money for his purchase. The Nevada Gaming Control Board accused Lowden of being deceitful, alleging that people with questionable records would have hidden interests in the Hacienda and control over it. Lowden denied this, stating that he would be the sole buyer. The board recommended against his purchase, but was overridden by the Nevada Gaming Commission. According to commission chairman Harry Reid, there was no evidence of hidden interests. He said that audit agents in the case &quot;didn&#x27;t do a very good job in their investigation.&quot; The sale was completed in July 1977.

In 1978, the Hacienda began offering deluxe rooms and suites as timeshares. Within two years, the hotel had 3,000 timeshare members. The Hacienda was associated with Resort Condominiums International, an exchange network that allowed timeshare owners to trade their units. The Little Church of the West, located further north on the Strip, was relocated to the Hacienda property in 1979, making room for the new Fashion Show Mall. By 1980, the Hacienda included a popular steakhouse known as the Charcoal Room. A $30 million expansion of the Hacienda was underway in 1980, scheduled for completion later that year. It included an 11-story tower with 300 rooms, adding on to the hotel&#x27;s 538-room count. Also added was a convention center, known as the Matador Arena. In addition to small conventions, it also hosted monthly, televised matches between professional boxers.

At the end of 1982, Wayne Newton was in discussions to become a co-owner in the Hacienda, as well as Lowden&#x27;s other Strip resort, the Sahara. After two months of negotiations, Newton decided against the idea, as he was considering other resorts for purchase. In the mid-1980s, the RV park operated as the Hacienda Adventure Camperland. It occupied 16 acres, and included 451 hook-ups, a pool, and a playground. In 1989, Lowden announced a $30 million plan to add a 400-room tower and to expand the casino. The tower was completed in 1991, bringing the room count to 1,137. The expansion also doubled the casino.

===Final years===
In its final years, the Hacienda was owned by Lowden through his company, Sahara Gaming Corporation. The resort struggled as new megaresorts were opened nearby, including the Excalibur (1990) and the Luxor (1993), both owned by Circus Circus Enterprises. In September 1994, Sahara Gaming stated that it was receiving offers to purchase the Hacienda, and that such offers would be considered for the right price. In January 1995, Bill Bennett announced that he would buy the Hacienda and adjacent acreage. Bennett was a director for Circus Circus Enterprises and had previously served as the company chairman. Bennett planned to rename the Hacienda and give it a South American theme. His plans would include extensive renovations and the addition of approximately 2,000 hotel rooms. However, his impending purchase was complicated by a corporate clause which would give Circus Circus Enterprises the right to purchase the resort instead of him.

Shortly after Bennett&#x27;s plans were announced, Circus Circus filed a lawsuit to prevent his purchase, stating that he was aware of the company&#x27;s plans to buy the property and that he proceeded anyway. The Hacienda occupied 47 acres, and Circus Circus wanted to buy an adjacent 74 acres to build a new resort on both parcels, connecting with the Luxor and Excalibur. Bennett and Circus Circus agreed to a settlement in March 1995, allowing the company to buy the Hacienda for $80 million and the 74 acres for another $73 million. Lowden said that an inability to reach an agreement with the Culinary Workers Union was a major factor in choosing to sell the Hacienda.
The Hacienda&#x27;s impending closure was announced in September 1996, as Circus Circus proceeded with plans to replace it. The closure would affect 900 employees. After 40 years, the Hacienda closed at 4:00 p.m. on December 1, 1996. The resort&#x27;s fixtures and hotel furnishings were donated to local charities. A few days later, the Little Church of the West was relocated down the street. The resort&#x27;s horse and rider neon sign was also saved, being put on display in downtown Las Vegas. The Neon Museum had the sign refurbished at a cost of $60,000, and it was then installed in its new location a couple weeks prior to the Hacienda&#x27;s closure. Before the Hacienda was demolished, the stairwells and stripped interiors of the hotel were used in a firefighter training mission to aid them in the event of a real high-rise fire. More than 30 local firefighters rushed through the hotel in reaction to an imaginary fire, situated on the fifth floor.

Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) was hired to demolish the 11-story hotel through implosion. CDI was usually given six months&#x27; notice, although Circus Circus Enterprises wanted the Hacienda demolished in 30 days for New Year&#x27;s Eve, as part of a televised event that would compete with the annual Times Square Ball celebration in New York City. After the Hacienda&#x27;s closure, salvage crews removed equipment such as air conditioners, and they had to knock out walls in the hotel&#x27;s southern end stairwell. This presented a potential problem for CDI, as wall strength is an important factor in properly controlling an implosion. CDI expected that the south end would not fall with the rest of the hotel. All of the walls in the hotel were built to be reinforced.

The implosion took place on the night of December 31, 1996, and was televised as the culmination of Fox&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s special &quot;Sinbad&#x27;s Dynamite New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;, where it aired approaching midnight ET. The coverage featured a cameo by ring announcer Michael Buffer. A six-minute fireworks show led up to the implosion at 9:00 p.m. More than 1,000 pounds of explosives were used for the implosion, which was watched by a crowd of more than 300,000 people. As expected, the southern end of the hotel did not fall. The next day, a crew was brought in to bring down the remaining structure with a wrecking ball. Thousands of spectators gathered to watch the final demolition.

Circus Circus Enterprises opened the Mandalay Bay resort on March 2, 1999, replacing the Hacienda. The company also licensed the Hacienda name to the Hacienda Hotel and Casino near Boulder City, Nevada. The name also continues to live on through Hacienda Avenue, a road that runs along the Mandalay Bay property, although a small portion was renamed Mandalay Bay Road.

==Entertainers and shows==
When the Hacienda opened, several other Las Vegas resorts had suffered financially after competing for high-priced entertainers. Initially, the Hacienda owners did not intend to battle for top performers, and the only live entertainment would be lounge acts. In the late 1950s, the Hacienda debuted a show by Cole Porter called &quot;Can-Can&quot;. In 1964, the resort hosted the puppet show &quot;Les Poupées de Paris&quot;. Comedian Hank Henry also performed at the Hacienda during the mid-1960s. The resort also offered shows such as &quot;Strictly Burlesque&quot; and &quot;Topless Models&quot;. After taking ownership of the Hacienda, Glick said in 1973 that the resort would return to the &quot;friendly image of the past&quot; by eliminating nude stage shows.

In 1967, the Hacienda hosted a two-hour late-night TV program called &quot;The Las Vegas Show&quot; on the fledgling United Network. Hosted by Bill Dana and featuring regulars Ann Elder, Pete Barbutti, Danny Meahan, Joanne Worley, Cully Richards and Jack Sheldon, the show (and the network) were shut down after only a month on the air.

In the mid-1970s, the resort offered a nude ice-skating show called &quot;Spice on Ice&quot;, although it eventually lost interest among audiences as other resorts opened their own topless ice shows. &quot;Spice on Ice&quot; ran for four years, and was replaced by an ice-skating variety show, &quot;Ice Fantasy&quot;, in 1977. Another ice show, titled &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, debuted in 1982, in the resort&#x27;s Fiesta showroom. The show included Albert Lucas, who would juggle while ice-skating. The show eventually ended, but returned in 1989, when the Hacienda began reviving its old ice shows. At the time, the show consisted of comedy acts and ice skating.

Comedian Redd Foxx was a frequent performer at the Hacienda during the late 1980s, and he later got married at the Little Church of the West. Magician Lance Burton performed at the Hacienda from 1991 to 1996.

<doc id="742347" wikidata="Q5323400" url="?curid=742347" title="EMC E5">
<text>The EMC E5 is a , A1A-A1A passenger train-hauling diesel locomotive manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation, and its corporate successor, General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Division (EMD) of La Grange, Illinois. It was produced exclusively for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (“The Burlington Route”), and its subsidiaries between 1940 and 1941.

The E5 was distinguished from the otherwise very similar E3, E4 and E6 by being clad in polished stainless steel to match the Burlington&#x27;s &quot;Zephyr&quot; trains. It also featured unique small grill-like ornamentation on both sides of the upper headlight. Like the other pre-war models in the E-series, the E5 had a sloping “slant nose” design and was equipped with two headlights—a regular stationary headlight above a gyrating Mars signal light. The E5 was the sixth model in the EMD E-unit series.

==Engine and powertrain==
The E5 was powered by twin 12-cylinder prime movers, developing a total of at 800 rpm. Designed specifically for railroad locomotives, the mechanically aspirated, two-stroke, 45-degree V-type engine, with an bore by stroke, giving displacement per cylinder. This engine design remained in production until 1966. 

The E5 was originally intended to look very different with the cab section looking very similar to the streamlined diesel passenger trains that the CB&amp;Q was famous for.

Power for the locomotive&#x27;s traction was provided by two direct-current generators, one for each prime mover. This generators powered four traction motors, two on each truck, in an A1A-A1A arrangement. This truck design was used across all E units, as well as on the MP 7100 AA6, CB&amp;Q 9908, and CRI&amp;P AB6 power cars. Since 1939, EMC/EMD has manufactured all of its major components.

== Original owners ==
== Locomotive details ==
== Surviving example ==
Only one E5 unit of the original 16 built survives today. The last surviving EMD E5 diesel, CB&amp;Q No. 9911A &quot;Silver Pilot&quot;, is owned and operated by the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois. The locomotive was last used on the Fort Worth and Denver Railway (a CB&amp;Q subsidiary) for the &quot;Texas Zephyr.&quot; It is now paired with one of the Burlington&#x27;s &quot;Nebraska Zephyrs&quot;, a 5 car, articulated, stainless steel passenger train from 1936. 

This equipment has been featured in several film productions, including the 1992 movie &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; and the 2006 movie &quot;Flags of Our Fathers.&quot; E5 9911A &quot;Silver Pilot&quot; was used with 4 stainless steel passenger cars relettered to resemble the Zephyr trainset. 9911 is equipped with dual horns, which is a WABCO E2 and a Leslie Controls RS2M.

<doc id="742349" wikidata="Q3556708" url="?curid=742349" title="Square wheel">
<text>A square wheel is a wheel that, instead of being circular, has the shape of a square. While literal square wheels exist, a more common use is as an idiom meaning stereotypically bad or naive engineering (see reinventing the wheel).

A square wheel can roll smoothly if the ground consists of evenly shaped inverted catenaries of the right size and curvature.

A different type of square-wheeled vehicle was invented in 2006 by Jason Winckler of Global Composites, Inc. in the United States. This has square wheels, linked together and offset by 22.5°, rolling on a flat surface. The prototype appears ungainly, but the inventor proposes that the system may be useful in microscopic-sized machines (MEMS). In 1997 Macalester College mathematics professor Stan Wagon constructed the first prototype of a catenary tricycle. An improved model made out of modern materials was built when the original vehicle wore out in April, 2004.

In 2012, &quot;MythBusters&quot; experimented with modifying vehicles with square tires, determining that, with speed, a truck fitted with square wheels can deliver a relatively smooth ride.

<text>In calculus, a derivative test uses the derivatives of a function to locate the critical points of a function and determine whether each point is a local maximum, a local minimum, or a saddle point. Derivative tests can also give information about the concavity of a function.

The usefulness of derivatives to find extrema is proved mathematically by Fermat&#x27;s theorem of stationary points.

==First-derivative test==
The first-derivative test examines a function&#x27;s monotonic properties (where the function is increasing or decreasing), focusing on a particular point in its domain. If the function &quot;switches&quot; from increasing to decreasing at the point, then the function will achieve a highest value at that point. Similarly, if the function &quot;switches&quot; from decreasing to increasing at the point, then it will achieve a least value at that point. If the function fails to &quot;switch&quot; and remains increasing or remains decreasing, then no highest or least value is achieved.

One can examine a function&#x27;s monotonicity without calculus. However, calculus is usually helpful because there are sufficient conditions that guarantee the monotonicity properties above, and these conditions apply to the vast majority of functions one would encounter.

===Precise statement of monotonicity properties===
Stated precisely, suppose that &quot;f&quot; is a real-valued function defined on some open interval containing the point &quot;x&quot; and suppose further that &quot;f&quot; is continuous at &quot;x&quot;.

* If there exists a positive number &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 such that &quot;f&quot; is weakly increasing on and weakly decreasing on , then &quot;f&quot; has a local maximum at &quot;x&quot;.
* If there exists a positive number &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 such that &quot;f&quot; is strictly increasing on and strictly increasing on , then &quot;f&quot; is strictly increasing on and does not have a local maximum or minimum at &quot;x&quot;.
Note that in the first case, &quot;f&quot; is not required to be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing to the left or right of &quot;x&quot;, while in the last case, &quot;f&quot; is required to be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. The reason is that in the definition of local maximum and minimum, the inequality is not required to be strict: e.g. every value of a constant function is considered both a local maximum and a local minimum.

===Precise statement of first-derivative test===
The first-derivative test depends on the &quot;increasing–decreasing test&quot;, which is itself ultimately a consequence of the mean value theorem. It is a direct consequence of the way the derivative is defined and its connection to decrease and increase of a function locally, combined with the previous section.

Suppose &quot;f&quot; is a real-valued function of a real variable defined on some interval containing the critical point &quot;a&quot;. Further suppose that &quot;f&quot; is continuous at &quot;a&quot; and differentiable on some open interval containing &quot;a&quot;, except possibly at &quot;a&quot; itself.

* If there exists a positive number &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 such that for every &quot;x&quot; in (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;r&quot;, &quot;a&quot;) we have and for every &quot;x&quot; in (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; + &quot;r&quot;) we have then &quot;f&quot; has a local maximum at &quot;a&quot;.
* If there exists a positive number &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 such that for every &quot;x&quot; in (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;r&quot;, &quot;a&quot;) we have and for every &quot;x&quot; in (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; + &quot;r&quot;) we have then &quot;f&quot; has a local minimum at &quot;a&quot;.
* If there exists a positive number &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 such that for every &quot;x&quot; in (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;r&quot;, &quot;a&quot;) ∪ (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; + &quot;r&quot;) we have then &quot;f&quot; is strictly increasing at &quot;a&quot; and has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum there.
* If none of the above conditions hold, then the test fails. (Such a condition is not vacuous; there are functions that satisfy none of the first three conditions, e.g. &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;2 sin(1/&quot;x&quot;)).

Again, corresponding to the comments in the section on monotonicity properties, note that in the first two cases, the inequality is not required to be strict, while in the third, strict inequality is required.

===Applications===

The first-derivative test is helpful in solving optimization problems in physics, economics, and engineering. In conjunction with the extreme value theorem, it can be used to find the absolute maximum and minimum of a real-valued function defined on a closed and bounded interval. In conjunction with other information such as concavity, inflection points, and asymptotes, it can be used to sketch the graph of a function.

==Second-derivative test (single variable)==
After establishing the critical points of a function, the &quot;second-derivative test&quot; uses the value of the second derivative at those points to determine whether such points are a local maximum or a local minimum. If the function &quot;f&quot; is twice-differentiable at a critical point &quot;x&quot; (i.e. a point where &quot;&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0), then:
* If formula_1, then formula_2 has a local maximum at formula_3.
* If formula_4, then formula_2 has a local minimum at formula_3.
* If formula_7, the test is inconclusive.

In the last case, Taylor&#x27;s theorem may sometimes be used to determine the behavior of &quot;f&quot; near &quot;x&quot; using higher derivatives.

===Proof of the second-derivative test===
Suppose we have formula_4 (the proof for formula_1 is analogous). By assumption, formula_10. Then 

: formula_11

Thus, for &quot;h&quot; sufficiently small we get

: formula_12

which means that formula_13 if formula_14 (intuitively, &quot;f&quot; is decreasing as it approaches formula_3 from the left), and that formula_16 if formula_17 (intuitively, &quot;f&quot; is increasing as we go right from &quot;x&quot;). Now, by the first-derivative test, formula_2 has a local minimum at formula_3.

===Concavity test===
A related but distinct use of second derivatives is to determine whether a function is concave up or concave down at a point. It does not, however, provide information about inflection points. Specifically, a twice-differentiable function &quot;f&quot; is concave up if formula_4 and concave down if formula_1. Note that if formula_22, then formula_23 has zero second derivative, yet is not an inflection point, so the second derivative alone does not give enough information to determine whether a given point is an inflection point.

===Higher-order derivative test===
The &quot;higher-order derivative test&quot; or &quot;general derivative test&quot; is able to determine whether a function&#x27;s critical points are maxima, minima, or points of inflection for a wider variety of functions than the second-order derivative test. As shown below, the second-derivative test is mathematically identical to the special case of &quot;n&quot; = 1 in the higher-order derivative test.

Let &quot;f&quot; be a real-valued, sufficiently differentiable function on an interval formula_24, let formula_25, and let formula_26 be a natural number. Also let all the derivatives of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;c&quot; be zero up to and including the &quot;n&quot;-th derivative, but with the (&quot;n&quot; + 1)th derivative being non-zero:

: formula_27

There are four possibilities, the first two cases where &quot;c&quot; is an extremum, the second two where &quot;c&quot; is a (local) saddle point:
* If &quot;n&quot; is odd and formula_28, then &quot;c&quot; is a local maximum.
* If &quot;n&quot; is odd and formula_29, then &quot;c&quot; is a local minimum.
* If &quot;n&quot; is even and formula_28, then &quot;c&quot; is a strictly decreasing point of inflection.
* If &quot;n&quot; is even and formula_29, then &quot;c&quot; is a strictly increasing point of inflection.

Since &quot;n&quot; must be either odd or even, this analytical test classifies any stationary point of &quot;f&quot;, so long as a nonzero derivative shows up eventually.

===Example===
Say we want to perform the general derivative test on the function formula_32 at the point formula_23. To do this, we calculate the derivatives of the function and then evaluate them at the point of interest until the result is nonzero.

: formula_34, formula_35

: formula_36, formula_37

: formula_38, formula_39

: formula_40, formula_41

: formula_42, formula_43

: formula_44, formula_45

As shown above, at the point formula_23, the function formula_47 has all of its derivatives at 0 equal to 0, except for the 6th derivative, which is positive. Thus &quot;n&quot; = 5, and by the test, there is a local minimum at 0.

==Multivariable case==

For a function of more than one variable, the second-derivative test generalizes to a test based on the eigenvalues of the function&#x27;s Hessian matrix at the critical point. In particular, assuming that all second-order partial derivatives of &quot;f&quot; are continuous on a neighbourhood of a critical point &quot;x&quot;, then if the eigenvalues of the Hessian at &quot;x&quot; are all positive, then &quot;x&quot; is a local minimum. If the eigenvalues are all negative, then &quot;x&quot; is a local maximum, and if some are positive and some negative, then the point is a saddle point. If the Hessian matrix is singular, then the second-derivative test is inconclusive.

<text>An elephant gun is a large caliber gun, rifled or smoothbore, originally developed for use by big-game hunters for elephant and other large game. Elephant guns were black powder muzzle-loaders at first, then black powder express rifles, then later used smokeless powder cartridges.

==Early use==
As Europeans made inroads into Africa in the early 19th century, guns were developed to handle the very large game encountered. This was for self-protection, food gathering, and sport. The first guns were the simple muzzle-loading shotgun designs already used for birds and loaded with solid balls of lead for use on large game. Due to their ineffectiveness on the largest game (up to 35 shots being recorded by some writers for a single elephant), they soon developed into larger caliber black powder smoothbores. The caliber was still measured in bore or gauge—10, 8, 6, 4 bore, and 2 bore—or the guns were named by number of projectiles per pound. The projectiles were lead round balls or short conical slugs, sometimes hardened with antimony.

These very large and very heavy firearms were the first to be known as the elephant guns of the black powder era (1850—1900), though their use also included all thick-skinned dangerous game such as rhinoceros, hippopotamus and cape buffalo. Due to the velocity limitations of black powder and lead—usually around —the only way to increase penetration was to make a larger gun. The largest-bore guns in common use (and bore rifles with the advent of breech loading and rifling in the late 19th century) included the-4 bore, using a slug at up to . Despite their enormous power, the short low-velocity slugs still suffered the penetration issues which plagued guns of this era, particularly for the toughest shot of all: defeating the bone mass for a frontal brain shot on an elephant. Thus, dangerous game hunting in the 19th century was as much a test of the gun-bearer&#x27;s ability to relay guns to the hunter, and of horsemanship to evade charges long enough to reload.

Following the bore guns were the brass case &quot;express&quot; rounds, which incorporated black powder with modern ballistics by making relatively smaller projectiles go faster. The dangerous game projectiles were often hardened lead alloy. The .577 Black Powder Express was the go-to dangerous game caliber from the 1870s through 1900. It spawned the .577 Express around 1890, which used smokeless cordite instead of black powder, and then the .577 Nitro Express in 1900, which used modern metal jacketed and solid bullets pushed by more modern smokeless powders.

It was not until the parallel developments of jacketed projectiles, closely followed by smokeless powders in the late 19th century, that dangerous game could be taken with near 100% certainty.

== Nitro Express rifles ==
The Nitro Express line (c.1895), so named because the composition of the early smokeless powders such as Poudre B, ballistite and cordite, were the first of the new order of elephant guns. With smaller metal-jacketed projectiles ranging from caliber and velocities around they possessed vastly improved trajectory and penetration over their black powder forebears. Within a few years the mighty bore guns of the previous era largely disappeared from the gamefields. The safari heyday of the early 20th century &quot;nitro era&quot; records much literature on such calibers as the .577 Nitro Express, .375 H&amp;H Magnum, .416 Rigby, .404 Jeffery, .505 Gibbs, .450 Nitro Express, and .470 Nitro Express. These rifles came out in single shot, bolt action, and double rifle configurations and continued to be used until ivory hunting died off in the mid-20th century. Thereafter, they largely switched roles to tools for game wardens and as back-up firearms for professional hunters guiding international hunters.

The American gun market produced several famous dangerous game cartridges around this time, such as the .458 Winchester Magnum, .378 Weatherby Magnum and .460 Weatherby Magnum and many of these were &quot;wildcatted&quot; (to modify an existing case and rifle to fire a different caliber bullet). The rest of the old Nitro express calibers had faded into obscurity until a resurgence in safari hunting came about in the 1970s and 1980s. This prompted a new boom in elephant gun development and calibers such as the .416 Weatherby Magnum and .416 Remington Magnum arrived in factory offerings. The late 1980s and 1990s produced the .700 Nitro Express and the new brass manufacturers allowed even more powerful elephant guns such as the .585 Nyati by Ross Seyfried, .577 Tyrannosaur by Colonel Art Alphin and .585 Gehringer by Karl Gehringer to be made by wildcatters. The .600 Overkill made by Rob Garnick represents the greatest power available from a standard hunting action. Other wildcats based on the heavy machine gun .50 BMG and similar anti-materiel rounds have been devised which are much more powerful, though they are not generally considered useful hunting arms as their weight usually exceeds .

==Use in wartime==

During World War I, both the British and German armies used elephant guns obtained from their African colonies on the Western Front. The British used elephant guns as a means of countering the German tactic of having their snipers advance towards enemy lines under the cover of a large, 6–10 millimeter (0.24–0.4 inch) thick steel plate. Though normal small arms were ineffective against the plate, elephant guns of the era had enough force to punch through. Additionally, to penetrate steel plate loopholes, large caliber firearms, such as elephant guns, were deployed to eliminate snipers.

In World War II, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta gave his personal collection of elephant rifles to Royal Italian Army troops under his command during the East African campaign. They were used to target British armored cars, as Italian forces suffered from a lack of anti-tank guns during the campaign. The Lahti L-39, a Finnish-made 20 mm caliber anti-tank gun, was nicknamed the &quot;elephant gun&quot; by Finnish Army troops during the Continuation War because of its stopping power, as was the British-made Boys anti-tank rifle.

<text>The opaque projector, or episcope is a device which displays opaque materials by shining a bright lamp onto the object from above. The episcope must be distinguished from the diascope, which is a projector used for projecting images of transparent objects (such as films), and from the epidiascope, which is capable of projecting images of both opaque and transparent objects. 

A system of mirrors, prisms and/or imaging lenses is used to focus an image of the material onto a viewing screen. Because they must project the reflected light, opaque projectors require brighter bulbs and larger lenses than overhead projectors. Care must be taken that the materials are not damaged by the heat generated by the light source. Opaque projectors are not as common as the overhead projector.

Opaque projectors are typically used to project images of book pages, drawings, mineral specimens, leaves, etc. They have been produced and marketed as artists&#x27; enlargement tools to allow images to be transferred to surfaces such as prepared canvas, or for lectures and discourses.

==History==

Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician and engineer Leonhard Euler demonstrated an opaque projector around 1756. It could project a clear image of opaque images and (small) objects.
French scientist Jacques Charles is thought to have invented the similar &quot;megascope&quot; in 1780. He used it for his lectures. Around 1872 Henry Morton used an opaque projector in demonstrations for huge audiences, for example in the Philadelphia Opera House which could seat 3500 people. His machine did not use a condenser or reflector, but used an oxyhydrogen lamp close to the object in order to project huge clear images.

The light source in early opaque projectors was often limelight. Incandescent light bulbs and halogen lamps are most commonly used today.

In the early and middle parts of the 20th century, low-cost opaque projectors were produced and marketed as toys for children.

In educational settings, the specific role of the opaque projector has been superseded first by the overhead projector and later the document camera, a lighted table with a fixed video camera above it. The image from the camera is displayed using a separate projector. The document camera is also called a desktop presenter unit or opaque projector.

Opaque projectors are still in use for tracing, called tracing projectors. A flat or solid original is projected on a larger sheet of paper onto a wall or easel, where the artist or craftsperson can trace the outline reliably.

==Types==
At the beginning of the 20th century, projection was split into two classes: &quot;If the light traverses the object, the projection is said to be diascopic, if by reflected light, episcopic.&quot;

Two main classes of opaque projectors thus existed:

* the episcope, which solely projected images of opaque objects
* the epidiascope, which was capable of projecting images of both opaque and transparent images

<doc id="742356" wikidata="Q38121" url="?curid=742356" title="Greater Swiss Mountain Dog">
<text>The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog ( or ) is a dog breed which was developed in the Swiss Alps. The name &quot;Sennenhund&quot; refers to people called &quot;Senn&quot; or &quot;Senner&quot;, dairymen and herders in the Swiss Alps. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are almost certainly the result of indigenous dogs mating with large mastiff-type dogs brought to Switzerland by foreign settlers. It was assumed to have almost died out by the late 19th century, since its work was being done by other breeds or machines, but was rediscovered in the early 1900s.

Its breed standard calls for a black, white, and rust colored coat.

Among the four Sennenhunde, or Swiss mountain dogs, this breed is considered the oldest, and is also the largest.

==History==
===Breed history===
The origin of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is not known. Beginning in 1515, the remote valleys of Switzerland were more or less isolated from world history for three centuries. Specific dog breeds were created by inbreeding, and puppies were given to neighbors and family members.
===Selective breeding===
The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a draft and drover breed that performs well very mountainous regions. Its popularity as a draft dog led to the nickname &quot;the poor man&#x27;s horse&quot;.

===Renewal of breed===

====Prevailing theory====
It was assumed that the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog had almost died out by the late 19th century, because their work was being done by other breeds or machines, but they were rediscovered in the early 1900s.

 to an advocate of the Swiss mountain dogs, geology professor Albert Heim (April 12, 1849 – August 31, 1937).

Heim was a Sennenhund expert, and started to encourage breeders to take an interest in them. These efforts resulted in the re-establishment of the breed. The first breed club was formed in 1912 to promote the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. The Bernese Mountain Dog and the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog are two of four distinctive farm-type dogs of Swiss origin who were saved from extinction and revitalized by Schertenlieb in the late 1800s.

====Secondary theory====
Dr. Hans Raber commented on this discrepancy in his book, &quot;Die Schweizer Hunderassen&quot;:

Although Heim has said that the big butcher dogs, Metzgerhund, became extinct after foreign imports became more popular, there is speculation over whether farmers would get an expensive foreign dog. In 1889 an International Dog Show was held in Winterthur, northern Switzerland; various Sennenhunde were exhibited.

===20th-century development===
In 1945 over 100 puppies were registered, indicating the existence of about 350–400 dogs of the breed at that time.

The breed was first recognised internationally in 1939, when the Swiss Standard was first published by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. In 1968 the breed was imported into the U.S.

There are a number of Greater Swiss that have been noted in the media. Network, owned by Sun Microsystems CEO, Scott McNealy, served as their mascot. Mouse, a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog living in Austin, TX served as the mascot of Keep Austin Dog Friendly. Oscar the Grouch, a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, was featured in the front page of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as he prepared to compete at the Westminster Dog Show. According to the AKC, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are 88th in popularity as a breed.

==Appearance==
it is a large, heavy-boned dog with incredible physical strength.

===Coat===

There is black on top of the dog&#x27;s back, ears, tail and the majority of the legs. There should be rust on the cheeks, a thumb print above the eyes, and also rust should appear on the legs between the white and black. There should be white on the muzzle, the feet, the tip of the tail, on the chest, and up from the muzzle to pass between the eyes. Symmetry in markings and coloring are not a priority in the American Kennel Club standard for the breed. Function and temperament are prioritized as the dog must work. It is common to hear the phrase &quot;the head doesn&#x27;t pull the cart&quot; or &quot;markings don&#x27;t pull the cart&quot; to mean that cosmetic features are not highly valued.

The double coat has a dense outer coat of about long. Textures of the topcoat can range from short, straight and fine to longer, wavier and coarser. The under coat is thick and ranges from the preferred dark gray to light gray to tawny, and must be on the neck, but can be all over the body – with such a thick coat, Sennenhunde shed throughout the year and they have a major shedding once or twice a year.

While the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Standard calls for a black, white and rust dog; they do come in other colors which include blue, white and tan tri-color; and rust and white bi-color. On the blue tri-color dogs, blue replaces where black would be and tan replaces where the rust would normally be. On the rust bi-color dogs, the dog is solid rust and white markings with a total absence of black coloring.

===Size===
Males range between at the shoulder and females range between at the shoulder. There is no standard for weight in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog; males tend to range between and females range between . Body length to height is approximately a 10 to 9 proportion; they are slightly longer than tall.

===Conformation===
====Head====
Their eyes are almond-shaped, vary in color from hazel to chestnut – dark brown is preferred – medium-sized, and neither deep-set nor protruding.

====Neck, topline and body====
the croup is the fused sacral vertebrae that form the roof of the pelvis and the first few vertebrae of the tail.

The depth of the chest is approximately one-half the height of the dog at the withers, and the deepest point of the chest should lie between the elbows, not above them.

====Forequarters====
The shoulders of a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog are long, sloping, strong, moderately laid back, flat and well-muscled.

====Hindquarters====
 broad, strong and muscular hindquarters, and proper angles between the stifles and hocks are essential for a draft dog to provide powerful rear-drive during movement. The breed standard &#x27;bend of stifle&#x27; refers to where the upper and the lower thighs meet. The hock joint corresponds to the human ankle and first short bones in the foot; the dog does not walk on the heel as people do.

====Gait====
==Temperament==
The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is happy with an enthusiastic nature and strong affinity to people and children. This breed is sociable, active, calm and dignified. While the breed does need exercise, they do not need a vast space. The breed often stands close to their owners, rarely straying far away without checking in.

==Health==
For the most part, this breed is relatively healthy for their size; Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs have far fewer problems than more populous breeds in the similar size range.

===Abdominal health issues===

The spleen is located in the left cranial abdomen and is held loosely in place by ligaments. Primary diseases of the spleen are splenic torsion and splenic tumors. Splenic torsion occurs when the spleen twists along the axis of the blood supply. Symptoms of splenic torsion include lethargy, abdominal distension and pale mucous membranes. One theory for the development of splenic torsion is that for dogs with chronic intermittent gastric dilatation, the dilation causes the spleen&#x27;s ligaments to stretch and increases the spleen&#x27;s mobility within the abdomen. The spleen becomes torsed because it is no longer anchored in its correct location.

==Lifespan==
Heavier dogs such as the Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs tend to have shorter lifespans than medium- and small-sized dogs; longevity is inversely related to breed size. Two websites list the life expectancy for Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs at 10 to 11 years; another lists it as 8–10 years. A survey by the US breed club shows a median lifespan of 6.75 years. Dog lifespans may vary in different countries, even in the same breed.

==Kennel club and pet registry recognition==
*The Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, or Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, is recognised internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI). They are in Group 2, Section 3 Swiss Mountain and Cattle Dogs; standards are dated March 25, 2003. The first standard was published not before February 5, 1939.
*The American Kennel Club (AKC) fully recognized the breed in 1995, and classifies them in the Working Group.
*The Canadian Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2006, and also places the breed in the Working Group.
*The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1992; they place the breed in the Guardian Dog Group.
*The Kennel Club, based in the United Kingdom, classifies the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog in the Working Group.
*The Continental Kennel Club (CKC) lists the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog and provides minimal information about the breed.
*The America&#x27;s Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) does have a classified ad section for Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs.
*The American Canine Registry (ACR) lists the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog as an acceptable breed under their American Canine Registry section.
*As of May 2010 the breed is not recognised by the New Zealand Kennel Club or the Australian National Kennel Council.

==Four breeds of Sennenhund==

The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is considered the oldest of the Swiss breeds. It is the largest of the four Sennenhund breeds; all four have the same colors and markings, but are different sizes.

Evolutionary hierarchy suggests breeds should genetically cluster into groups sharing recent common ancestry. A genetic clustering algorithm could not easily distinguish between the obviously related pairs of Greater Swiss Mountain Dog and the Bernese Mountain Dog.

The four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name followed by the most popular English version of the breed name:

* Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog
* Berner Sennenhund, Bernese Mountain Dog
* Appenzeller Sennenhund, Appenzeller Mountain Dog
* Entlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher Mountain Dog

==Similar breeds==
In addition to the three breeds mentioned in the previous section, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are related to other mountain dogs: Boxers, Bullmastiffs, Doberman Pinschers, Great Danes, Great Pyrenees, Komondors, Kuvaszes and mastiffs. The breed probably contributed to the development of the St. Bernard and the Rottweiler.

<text>Hjalmar Emil Fredrik Söderberg (2 July 1869 – 14 October 1941) was a Swedish novelist, short story writer, playwright and journalist. His works often deal with melancholy and lovelorn characters, and offer a rich portrayal of contemporary Stockholm through the eyes of the flaneur. Söderberg is regarded as one of the greatest writers in Swedish literature. His works are translated to more than twenty languages.

==Biography==
Born in Stockholm, Söderberg began his literary course at the Swedish news daily &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, age 20. Six years later his first novel was released, &quot;Förvillelser&quot; (Delusions, 1895), written from the viewpoint of a young dandy aimlessly idling in the capital, recklessly squandering money and love. The somber yet reflective and insightful story would prove typical of much of Söderberg&#x27;s output. Subsequent to the release of &quot;Historietter&quot; (1898), a collection of twenty short stories, his next major work – &quot;Martin Bircks Ungdom&quot; (&quot;Martin Birck&#x27;s Youth&quot;, 1901) – was released. Much like &quot;Förvillelser&quot; in terms of its vivid environmental depiction and acute perception, it follows the development of a young amateur poet. Söderberg&#x27;s next novel, by some considered his masterpiece, was &quot;Doktor Glas&quot; (Doctor Glas, 1905). In a frightful tale of vengeance and passion, Söderberg stays true to his detached yet emotionally poignant writing style. The love story &quot;Den allvarsamma leken&quot; (&quot;The Serious Game&quot;, 1912) was Söderberg&#x27;s last conventional novel.

A prolific short story writer, Söderberg published numerous stories in magazines and newspapers that was later collected in short story collections. Following his most famous book of short stories &quot;Historietter&quot;, these include &quot;Främlingarna&quot; (&quot;The Strangers&quot;, 1903), &quot;Det mörknar öfver vägen&quot; (&quot;It Is Darkening Over the Road&quot;, 1907) and &quot;Den talangfulla draken&quot; (&quot;The Talented Dragon&quot;, 1913).

Söderberg was also a playwright, best known for &quot;Gertrud&quot; (1906) about the woman Gertrud who abstain the mediocre love from her husband and two lovers and choose to live in loneliness in waiting for the perfect love that may not be. He also wrote the plays &quot;Aftonstjärnan&quot; (&quot;The Evening Star&quot;, 1912) and &quot;Ödestimmen&quot; (&quot;The Hour of Destiny&quot;, 1922).
In his later years, Söderberg turned to journalism and theological studies. His books about Jesus, the novel &quot;Jesus Barabbas&quot; (1928) and the scientific study &quot;Den förvandlade Messias&quot; (1932, &quot;The Transformed Messiah&quot;), were highly controversial at the time. In the books Söderberg claimed that Jesus and Barabbas were in fact the same person, and that Jesus was never crucified. His later books also included a collection of poems (&quot;Vers och varia&quot;, 1921) and a collection of various prose (&quot;Resan till Rom&quot;, 1929). Söderberg was also an acclaimed translator, translating works by Anatole France, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Baudelaire and Heinrich Heine to Swedish.

He was a fierce critic of Nazism, and wrote often on the subject in the revered Resistance paper &quot;Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning&quot;. He died in Denmark and is buried on Vestre Kirkegård in Copenhagen.

Söderberg was married to Märta Abenius (1871–1932) from 1899 to 1917. They had three children: actress Dora Söderberg-Carlsten (1899–1990), Tom Söderberg (1900–1991), and Mikael Söderberg (1903–1931). From 1917 he was married in Denmark to Emelie Voss (1876–1957), with whom he had one child: actress Betty Søderberg (1910–1993).

Söderberg had a stormy on/off relationship with Maria von Platen (1871–1959) for a number of years; this relationship which is said to have influenced him in his writing, especially his 1906 play &quot;Gertrud&quot;, and the character of Lydia in &quot;The Serious Game&quot;.

==Themes==
The characters in Söderberg&#x27;s stories always appear to suffer from an incurable loneliness, standing on the side of the events observing themselves and their environment. Feelings of melancholy and nostalgia are prominent. Determinism is a recurring theme in Söderberg&#x27;s writing. It is a prominent theme in all of his novels, particularly in &quot;Doktor Glas&quot; and &quot;The Serious Game&quot;. The latter book has the motto &quot;You do not choose your destiny&quot;, which could be the motto of Söderberg&#x27;s entire authorship.

==Legacy==
Hjalmar Söderberg is regarded as one of the greatest writers in Swedish literature. His works are still widely read and are frequently published in new editions. His works are translated to more than twenty languages.

A recent reissue of Paul Britten Austin&#x27;s translation of &quot;Doktor Glas&quot; into English, as &quot;Doctor Glas&quot;, and with a perceptive introduction by Margaret Atwood, has meant a rise in his popularity in the Anglo-Saxon literary world.

== Quotations ==
*&quot;I believe in the lust of the flesh and the incurable isolation of the soul.&quot; (From &quot;Doctor Glas&quot;, later used in &quot;Gertrud&quot;)
*&quot;One wants to be loved, in lack thereof admired, in lack thereof feared, in lack thereof loathed and despised. One wants to instill some sort of emotion in people. The soul trembles before emptiness and desires contact at any price.&quot; (From &quot;Doctor Glas&quot;)

<text>Central Otago is an area located in the inland part of the Otago region in the South Island of New Zealand. The motto for the area is &quot;A World of Difference&quot;.

The area is dominated by mountain ranges and the upper reaches of the Clutha River and tributaries. The wide flat plateau of the Maniototo which lies between the upper reaches of the Taieri River and the Clutha&#x27;s northern tributary the Manuherikia is also part of Central Otago.

Characterised by cold winters and hot, dry summers, the area is only lightly populated. First significant European occupation came with the discovery of gold at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully near Lawrence in 1861, which led to the Otago gold rush. Other towns and villages include Alexandra, Bannockburn, Clyde, Cromwell, Millers Flat, Naseby, Omakau, Ranfurly, Roxburgh, St. Bathans, and Wedderburn.

Since the 19th century, most of the area&#x27;s economic activity has centred on sheep, stone fruit, and tourism. In recent years, deer farms and vineyards have increased the region&#x27;s economic diversification. Central Otago is the world&#x27;s southernmost commercial wine production region. Recently the cool climate varieties Riesling and Pinot noir have been recognised as being especially suitable, and as the vines age Central Otago wines can be expected to improve even further, as the plantings are new and increasing rapidly.

== Administration ==

The Central Otago District Council, based in Alexandra, administers territorial authority matters, while the Otago Regional Council has overview of environmental matters such as clean air and water resources.

== Climate ==
Central Otago is the coldest, driest part of New Zealand. The seasons are sharply defined: summers are hot and low in humidity; winter mornings are often misty, the days cloudless and windless and the nights freezing. Alexandra, for example, has the lowest average annual rainfall () recorded anywhere in New Zealand, is the least windy and has 148 frosts annually (only Lake Tekapo, with 149, has more). Ophir, away, holds the record for the lowest air temperature recorded – in mid-1995 – but it also held the highest reading ( in 1959) until was recorded at Rangiora, in Canterbury in 1973.

Spring warms the soil and fruit tree blossom dominates the district&#x27;s orchard areas. Temperatures range from with 10 frosts a month. Average rainfall is a month and sunshine 206 hours per month.

In summer, daylight lasts as long as 10 P.M.. Temperatures range from on several days. Rainfall averages a month and sunshine 227 hours per month.

Autumn is brilliant as the extensive orchards and poplar shelterbelts turn red, yellow and gold. Temperatures range from . Rainfall averages a month with 11 frosts monthly and 150 hours of sunshine.

Winter brings a temperature range of , and average monthly rainfall of , 25 days with frosts and 107 hours of sunshine per month during the short days.

== &quot;Central&quot; ==
The colloquial name for Central Otago is simply &quot;Central&quot;. Residents from the surrounding regions may not talk about being &quot;in&quot; Central Otago or going &quot;to&quot; Central Otago – instead referring to being or going &quot;up Central&quot; (this usage is mainly limited to residents of Canterbury, Otago and Southland). The former Otago Central Railway, which ran through most of the major towns of Central Otago, was also referred to as &#x27;the Central&#x27;.

Areas around the area governed by the Central Otago District Council area are also often simply known as Central, such as Arrowtown, Queenstown and Wānaka.

<text>Orbital Sciences Corporation (commonly referred to as Orbital) was an American company specializing in the design, manufacture, and launch of small- and medium- class space and launch vehicle systems for commercial, military and other government customers. In 2014, Orbital merged with Alliant Techsystems (ATK) to create a new company called Orbital ATK, which in turn was purchased by Northrop Grumman in 2018.

Orbital was headquartered in Dulles, Virginia and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol ORB. Orbital&#x27;s primary products were satellites and launch vehicles, including low Earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous Earth orbit and planetary spacecraft for communications, remote sensing, scientific and defense missions; ground- and air-launched launch vehicles that delivered satellites into orbit; missile defense systems that were used as interceptor and target vehicles; and human-rated space systems for Earth orbit, lunar and other missions. Orbital also provided satellite subsystems and space-related technical services to government agencies and laboratories.

On 29 April 2014, Orbital Sciences announced that it would merge with Alliant Techsystems to create a new company called Orbital ATK. The merger was completed on 9 February 2015 and Orbital Sciences ceased to exist as an independent entity.

On 18 September 2017, Northrop Grumman announced plans to purchase Orbital ATK for US$7.8 billion in cash plus assumption of US$1.4 billion in debt, and on 6 June 2018, the acquisition was completed, and Orbital ATK became Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. As of 1 January 2020, the name was changed to Space Systems under a large restructuring and rebranding initiative.

== History ==
Orbital was founded and incorporated in 1982 by three friends who had met earlier while at Harvard Business School—David W. Thompson, Bruce Walker Ferguson, and Scott L. Webster. Initial capitalization for Orbital was provided by Fred C. Alcorn, a Texas oilman and Sam Dunnam, a Texas businessman in September 1982. In 1985, Orbital procured its first contract for providing up to four transfer orbital stage (TOS) vehicles to NASA. In 1987, the seeds for the Orbcomm constellation were planted when Orbital began investigating a system using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to collect data from remote locations. In 1988, Orbital acquired Space Data Corporation in Arizona—one of the world&#x27;s leading suppliers of suborbital rockets—thereby broadening its rocket business and manufacturing capabilities. This was followed by the opening of a new facility in Chandler, Arizona in 1989 to house the company&#x27;s expanding rocket business.

In 1990, the company successfully carried out eight space missions, highlighted by the initial launch of the Pegasus launch vehicle, the world&#x27;s first privately developed space launch vehicle (the claim of being the first privately developed space launch vehicle can be contested as Pegasus received significant funding from NASA and DARPA, and a predecessor private rocket exists, the Conestoga rocket). Shortly following the successful Pegasus launch, Orbital conducted an initial public offering (IPO) in 1990 and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 1993, Orbital established its headquarters in Dulles, Virginia. In 1994, Orbital successfully conducted the inaugural launch of the Taurus (now renamed as Minotaur-C) launch vehicle.

In the early 2000s, Orbital continued expanding its missile defense systems business with a US$900 million award to develop, build, test and support interceptor booster vehicles. In 2006, Orbital conducted its 500th mission since the company&#x27;s founding with products that included satellites, launch vehicles, and missile defense systems. In 2007, the first interplanetary spacecraft built by Orbital, Dawn was launched on an eight-year, three-billion-mile journey to the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. A major milestone in the company&#x27;s history was in 2008 when it received a long-term NASA contract to provide cargo transportation services to and from the International Space Station (ISS) with a value of approximately US$1.9 billion for missions from 2011 to 2015. Orbital used its Cygnus spacecraft and Antares launch vehicle to transport cargo to ISS following the success of Cygnus Orb-D1 and Cygnus CRS Orb-1.

=== Acquisitions ===
Orbital Science made a number of strategic acquisitions in the 1990s and 2000s to strengthen its position in the satellite market.

In 1994, Orbital completed acquisition of Fairchild Industries&#x27; subsidiary Space and Defense Corporation, and merged the Fairchild Space business with its own satellite design and manufacturing division. The electronics business of this subsidiary was later sold off in 2000.

In 1997, Orbital acquired CTA, Inc, a company that, under the spacecraft design engineering and business leadership of Tom van der Heyden – designer of the GEOStar spacecraft – had designed and built the first geostationary &quot;lightsat&quot; under contract to Indonesia for Asia&#x27;s first Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) television broadcast program, and the world&#x27;s first S-Band television broadcast satellite – providing an entry into the fast-growing Geosynchronous (GEO) communications satellite market.

In 2010, Orbital acquired the Gilbert, Arizona-based satellite development and manufacturing unit from General Dynamics (General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, formerly Spectrum Astro) to complement its main satellite manufacturing facility in Dulles, Virginia.

On 29 April 2014, Orbital Sciences announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Alliant Techsystems to combine Orbital and ATK&#x27;s Aerospace and Defense (A&amp;D) Groups to create a US$4.5 billion (combined calendar year 2013 annual revenue), 13000-person company. The new company was called Orbital ATK, Inc.

On 18 September 2017, Northrop Grumman announced plans to purchase Orbital ATK for US$7.8 billion in cash plus assumption of US$1.4 billion in debt. Orbital ATK shareholders approved the buyout on 29 November 2017. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved the acquisition with conditions on 5 June 2018, and one day later, Orbital ATK were absorbed and became Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems.

== Business groups ==
=== Space Systems Group (SSG) ===
Orbital was a provider of small- to medium-class satellites. Since the company&#x27;s founding in 1982, Orbital has delivered 150 spacecraft to commercial, military and civil customers worldwide. To date, these spacecraft have amassed well over 1000 years of on-orbit operations.

The communications and imaging satellites developed by Orbital are smaller and more affordable. The geosynchronous orbit (GEO) communications satellites provide commercial satellite services such as 
direct-to-home digital television, business data transmission, cable program distribution and wireless communications. In addition, Orbital also provides constellations of low Earth orbit communications satellites such as the 35-satellite ORBCOMM data communications network, and the 81 spacecraft (integration and test) for the IridiumNEXT constellation. Earth imagery and high resolution digital imaging satellites such as the OrbView series are also developed and manufactured by Orbital.

The science and environmental satellites developed by Orbital perform scientific research, carry out deep space exploration (e.g. Dawn spacecraft), conduct remote sensing missions (e.g. Landsat 4, 5 and 8), and demonstrate new space technologies. In the last 10 years, Orbital has built more scientific and environmental monitoring satellites for NASA than any other company.

=== Launch Systems Group (LSG) ===
Orbital&#x27;s space launch vehicles are considered the industry standard for boosting small payloads to orbit. The Pegasus launch vehicle is launched from the company&#x27;s L-1011 carrier aircraft, &quot;Stargazer&quot; and has proven to be the industry&#x27;s small space launch workhorse, having conducted 40 missions from six different launch sites worldwide since 1990.

The Minotaur ground-launched launch vehicles combine Pegasus upper-stages with either government-supplied or commercially available first-stage rocket motors to boost larger payloads to orbit. Minotaur IV combines decommissioned Peacekeeper rocket motors with proven Orbital avionics and fairings to provide increased lifting capacity for government-sponsored payloads.

With the development of the Antares space launch vehicle, Orbital is extending its capabilities to provide medium-class launch services for U.S. government, commercial and international customers. The inaugural launch of Antares occurred on 21 April 2013 from Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) at Wallops Island, Virginia.

Orbital is also a major provider of suborbital target and interceptor launch vehicles for the U.S. missile defense systems. In the last 10 years, Orbital conducted nearly 50 major launches for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy to develop, test and enhance U.S. missile defense systems.

=== Advanced Programs Group (APG) ===
Orbital&#x27;s Advanced Programs Group focused on developing and producing human-rated space systems, satellites and related systems for national security space programs, and advanced flight systems for atmospheric and space missions.

In support of human space systems, Orbital is one of two companies providing commercial cargo resupply services to the ISS for NASA. Orbital&#x27;s medium-class rocket—Antares is used to launch the Cygnus advanced maneuvering spacecraft to deliver cargo to the ISS. Under the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract with NASA, Orbital will perform eight cargo missions to the ISS. Operational flights began in 2013 from the new Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) at Wallops Island in Virginia. In addition, the company is exploring opportunities to adapt the Cygnus design for other possible space exploration applications.

For National Security Space systems, Orbital provides products ranging from smaller, more affordable spacecraft busses to hosted payload applications. For Advanced Flight systems, Orbital is applying its to design and build an intermediate-class air-launched rocket system for Stratolaunch Systems. Orbital has developed the operational concept and completed the preliminary design for the air-launched rocket. It will be responsible for the development, production, test and operations of the full system and related ground operations.

=== Technical Services Division (TSD) ===
The Technical Services Division (TSD) provided engineering, production and technical management expertise primarily for space-related science and defense programs. Typically, it supplies specialized personnel—engineers, scientists, technicians and other professionals—with specific knowledge in the areas that its customers are pursuing. The Orbital employees often work side-by-side with the customers&#x27; technical staff at their facilities. They perform a wide range of functions, from system-level efforts such as special payload equipment and training support for NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope servicing missions to component-level tasks including development of high-energy microwave transmitters for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).

=== Transportation Management Systems (TMS) ===
The TMS unit combined satellite navigation and wireless communications to enable transit control centers to manage the dispatch of public transit, highway service vehicles and commuter light rail systems. As of 2008, the technology was used by more than 60 clients, exceeding 27500 vehicles, or more than 30% of the United States and Canada fleet. TMS clients included some of the nation&#x27;s largest fleet management systems, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. In 2008, the technology services provider Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) Inc. agreed to buy the Transportation Management Systems unit for US$42.5 million. The sale transferred an estimated 130 to 140 Orbital employees based in Columbia, Maryland, to ACS.

==Orbital products==

===Space launch vehicles===
* Minotaur – Employing a combination of U.S. government-supplied rocket motors and Orbital&#x27;s commercial launch technologies, the Minotaur family of launchers provides low-cost access to space for government sponsored payloads. 
**Minotaur I – Minotaur I made its inaugural flight in January 2000, successfully delivering several small military and university satellites into orbit and marking the first-ever use of residual U.S. Government Minuteman boosters in a space launch vehicle. To date, Minotaur I has conducted 11 missions with a 100% success record, having launched a total of 62 satellites.
**Minotaur IV – The Minotaur IV space launch vehicle consists of three Peacekeeper solid rocket stages, a commercial Orion 38 fourth-stage motor and subsystems derived from OSC&#x27;s established space launch boosters, including a flight-proven standard 92-inch fairing. Capable of boosting payloads more than 1,750 kg into orbit, Minotaur IV supports dedicated or shared launch missions and is compatible with multiple U.S. government and commercial launch sites. The inaugural Minotaur IV flight occurred in 2010 and five missions have been conducted through 2016 with a 100% success record boosting nine satellite into orbit and two hypersonic flight vehicles on suborbital trajectories.
**Minotaur V – Minotaur V is a five-stage evolutionary version of Minotaur IV to provide a cost-effective capability to launch U.S. Government-sponsored small spacecraft into high energy trajectories, including Geosynchronous Transfer Orbits (GTO) as well as translunar and beyond. Like Minotaur IV, the first three stages of the Minotaur V are former Peacekeeper solid rocket motors. The fourth and fifth stages are commercial STAR™ motors. The inaugural Minotaur V mission successfully boosted NASA&#x27;s LADEE spacecraft on a lunar trajectory in September 2013.
**Minotaur VI – The Minotaur VI vehicle adds a lower stage to the existing and flight demonstrated Minotaur IV vehicle configuration providing a significant increase in performance with only a modest increase in cost. Capable of boosting up to 2,600 kg to Low-Earth Orbit, Minotaur VI is also available with an optional upper-stage motor for high energy trajectory missions.
**Minotaur-C – The Minotaur-C (formerly known as Taurus) space launch vehicle is a commercial variant of the Minotaur product line designed to serve the U.S. government market. Of 9 launches, 6 have been successful.
* Pegasus – The three-stage Pegasus is used to deploy small satellites weighing up to 1,000 pounds into low-Earth orbit. Pegasus is carried aloft by the &quot;Stargazer&quot; L-1011 aircraft to approximately 40,000 feet over open ocean, where it is released and free-falls five seconds before igniting its first-stage rocket motor. With its unique delta-shaped wing, Pegasus typically delivers satellites into orbit in a little over 10 minutes. Pegasus has conducted 42 missions since its inaugural launch in 1990, 37 of which were successful.

* Pegasus II – Pegasus II was to be an air-launched orbital rocket, which was under development in 2012–2015. The design was &quot;shelved&quot; by Stratolaunch in May 2015.
* Antares – Antares is a two-stage launch vehicle designed to deliver medium-class payloads weighing up to 6120 kg into space. Antares utilizes refurbished Russian-built engines which were originally manufactured in the 1960s and 1970s for the Soviet Moon rocket. Initially developed to demonstrate commercial re-supply of the International Space Station under a NASA contract, the first launch took place on April 21, 2013, from Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia. The fifth launch ended in failure on October 28, 2014, completely destroying the vehicle and damaging the launch pad.
* Antares follow on – Following the loss of the Antares rocket on the Orb-3 mission in October 2014, Orbital announced that it would not use &quot;the 40-year-old AJ-26 engines on the rocket’s next flight.&quot; The new first stage engine is reportedly the Russian RD-193 rather than the AJ-26 engines used in the initial version of the Antares launch vehicle, which were remanufactured Russian NK-33s. Orbital Sciences Corp. has reportedly signed a contract with Russia&#x27;s NPO Energomash to supply 60 new built RD-181 engines for the Antares rocket. While Antares/AJ-26 is not flying and the follow-on launch vehicle is in development and test, Orbital is shopping to purchase launch services for its Cygnus capsule to ISS cargo runs temporarily from another launch service provider.

===Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) to ISS===
With the successful demonstration in September 2013 of the Cygnus spacecraft and the Antares launch vehicle under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, Orbital commenced regular ISS cargo missions under the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract. The total NASA contract to Orbital is worth $1.9 Billion for providing eight pressurized cargo missions to the ISS. 
Cygnus is capable of delivering 2,000 kg of pressurized cargo to the ISS. An enhanced version to be flown in later CRS missions is able to deliver 2,700 kg of pressurized cargo. The first of the eight contracted Cygnus missions to the ISS was completed on 18 February 2014. The October 28, 2014, launch failure was the third contracted Cygnus mission to the ISS.

===Missile Defense Systems – interceptors and targets===
Orbital&#x27;s Missile Defense Systems product line consists of interceptors and target vehicles.
* The Ground-Based Interceptor – Orbital is the sole supplier of interceptor boosters for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency&#x27;s Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, to defend against long-range ballistic missile attacks. The GMD system is designed to intercept and destroy hostile ballistic missiles in their midcourse phase of flight before they reenter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Orbital is responsible for the design, development and testing of the Orbital Boost Vehicle (OBV), a silo-launched, three-stage rocket derived from its Pegasus, Taurus and Minotaur space launch boosters. The OBV has successfully conducted multiple test flights and has been deployed in silos in Alaska and California.
* Ballistic Missile Targets – Orbital&#x27;s family of target vehicles extends from long-range ballistic target launch vehicles, which include targets for testing MDA&#x27;s GMD system, to medium- and short-range target vehicles. Current programs include Air-launched Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) targets and Ground-launched Intercontinental Ballistic Missile(ICBM) targets.
* GQM-163A “Coyote” Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Target – The GQM-163A “Coyote” is used for Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) targets. It can achieve cruise speeds of over Mach 2.5 while flying approximately 15 feet above the ocean&#x27;s surface (&quot;sea-skimming&quot; trajectory). In addition to this sea-skimming trajectory, Orbital has also successfully demonstrated a &quot;high diver&quot; trajectory mission.

===National security systems===
Orbital&#x27;s national security systems range from smaller, more affordable spacecraft buses (e.g. disaggregated systems) to hosted payload applications.

Orbital advocates disaggregated systems because conceptually disaggregated systems can lower the cost and accelerate the development and deployment of national security space systems. For example, Orbital&#x27;s GEOStar-1 spacecraft provides a compact platform optimized for GEO missions (adaptable for MEO for launch aboard Minotaur, Falcon, and EELV launch vehicles to deliver resilient capabilities in a relatively short period of time (years instead of decades). 
Orbital&#x27;s hosted payload capabilities in national security systems include the &quot;Hosted Infrared Payload&quot; &quot;(CHIRP)&quot; program for the U.S. Air Force. The wide-field of view sensor was hosted on an Orbital-built commercial GEO communications satellite. Orbital&#x27;s hosted payload program takes advantage of the high frequency of commercial satellite launches and the excess resources that typically exist on a commercial communications satellite to provide frequent and low-cost access to space for National Security Systems.

===Advanced flight systems===
Orbital&#x27;s current advanced flight systems programs include the contract with Stratolaunch Systems to design a new intermediate-class rocket to be carried aloft and launched from the largest aircraft ever built-Stratolaunch carrier aircraft. Orbital is responsible for the program&#x27;s overall systems engineering, and the development, production, test, and operations of the air-launch rocket and related ground operations, including payload and launch vehicle integration. A demo launch is currently scheduled for 2017.
Orbital&#x27;s heritage programs in advanced flight systems include the NASA X-34 and X-43 programs, and the Orion Launch Abort System, among others.

<text>The golden-mantled ground squirrel (Callospermophilus lateralis) is a ground squirrel native to western North America. It is distributed in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta, and through much of the western United States.

==Description==
This ground squirrel is generally about in length. The weight range for adults is between 120 and 394 grams (0.26 to 0.86 lbs.) It has whitish or yellow-gray underparts. The tail is brown to black with buff edges and a yellowish to reddish underside. It has pale rings around the eyes. The &quot;mantle&quot; across the shoulders is tawny to reddish, with males having a deeper reddish tinge. This species is distinguished from similar ground squirrels by a black-bordered white stripe down each side of the back and is distinguished from similar looking chipmunks by its lack of facial stripes.

Some authors describe many subspecies of this taxon.

==Biology and ecology==

This species occurs in forests, chaparral, meadow margins, and sagebrush, especially in areas with many rocks or forest litter that provides shelter. It is associated with many kinds of coniferous trees, aspen, and manzanita.

It is omnivorous, feeding on pine nuts, acorns, herbs and shrubs, fungi, many kinds of insects, eggs, young birds, lizards, carrion, and human foods when available. This species caches food near its burrow, especially during the late summer and fall. The squirrel has also been known to &quot;beg&quot; for human food at the wildlife urban interface.

This species hibernates over the winter. During the summers they gain extra weight in order to prepare for hibernation. The squirrels hibernate in dens that can reach up to 100 feet in length although they are typically shallow in depth. The breeding season commences when males and females emerge from hibernation in the spring. Most broods are born in July. A female has two to eight young per litter, with an average of five. There is no paternal care of the offspring. Juveniles resemble adults by 40 days of age. The life span of this ground squirrel is up to about seven years.
Most adults are independent, rarely cooperating, and usually competing for resources. They may assemble at sites with abundant food but develop a group hierarchy. Adults reside alone in burrows, creating nests for hibernation or rearing of young. This species has been known to nest in structures, such as roofs. This species becomes vocal when it feels threatened, making squeaking noises or growling. However, it is generally not a very vocal species.

Predators of this squirrel include snakes, foxes, weasels, and bears. It may carry the Rocky Mountain wood tick, a vector of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other diseases.

==Conservation==
This is a common and widespread species that is not considered to be threatened.

<text>Niko Kovač (; born 15 October 1971) is a professional football manager and former player. He is currently the manager of Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund.

Born and raised in West Germany, Kovač was the long-standing captain of the Croatia national team until his retirement from international football in January 2009. A defensive midfielder who was known for his passing and tackling skills, Kovač was, at the time of his retirement, the oldest player in the Croatian squad and had captained them at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008. He has also enjoyed a high level of top club action, having spent most of his club career in the German Bundesliga, including spells with Hertha BSC, Bayer Leverkusen, Hamburger SV and Bayern Munich.

He ended his playing career with Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg, where he then took the non-playing role of the reserve team coach and eventually became assistant manager under team manager Ricardo Moniz. In January 2013, Kovač took over the Croatia national under-21 team and in October 2013 he took over the Croatia senior team following the dismissal of Igor Štimac. Kovač managed Croatia at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, then became head coach of Eintracht Frankfurt in 2016, winning the 2018 DFB-Pokal Final with the club. At Bayern, Kovač won the domestic double in 2019 after a strong ending to the season, but lost his job later in autumn. In the summer of 2020, Kovač was appointed manager of Monaco, but was sacked on 1 January 2022. He then returned to German football as manager of Wolfsburg from 2022 to 2024 before taking over at Borussia Dortmund in January 2025.

==Club career==
===Early career (1987–1996)===
Kovač started training football as an eight-year old with Rapide Wedding in Berlin. After that, he joined Hertha Zehlendorf and soon became a member of the first team. He moved to Hertha BSC in 1991 and started his professional career with the club that competed in the 2. Bundesliga at the time.

During his youth, Kovač in parallel with football practised judo, earning the blue belt. After finishing high school (gymnasium), he continued his education at Free University of Berlin. He pursued a degree in business studies while playing for Hertha BSC. After eight semesters, he left university when he secured a contract with Bayer Leverkusen.

===Bayer Leverkusen (1996–1999)===
In the summer of 1996, Kovač left Hertha, still a 2. Bundesliga side at the time, for Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen. He made his Bundesliga debut on 17 August 1996, appearing as a half-time substitute in the club&#x27;s opening match of the 1996–97 season, a 4–2 home victory over Borussia Dortmund. He appeared in 32 Bundesliga matches in his first season with Leverkusen, also scoring three goals. However, he mostly played as a substitute in the following two seasons and missed several matches in the 1997–98 season after sustaining an injury in the club&#x27;s home match against VfB Stuttgart in December 1997. In three seasons with Bayer Leverkusen, Kovač made 77 Bundesliga appearances and scored eight goals in league competition. At the club, he was teammates with his younger brother Robert for the first time in his professional career.

===Hamburger SV (1999–2001)===
Kovač joined Hamburger SV in the summer of 1999 and spent two seasons with the club, making 55 Bundesliga appearances and scoring 12 goals in the Bundesliga.

===Bayern Munich (2001–2003)===
In July 2001, Kovač signed for then Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League winners, Bayern Munich. Kovač joined the club along with his brother, Robert. However, Kovač did not manage to establish himself as a regular at the club and left Bayern for a second stint with Hertha BSC after two seasons in the summer of 2003. He appeared in 34 Bundesliga matches and scored three goals for Bayern in the league.

===Hertha BSC (2003–2006)===
Kovač then signed for Hertha again. He made 75 Bundesliga appearances for the club and scored eight goals in the league.

===Red Bull Salzburg (2006–2009)===

After the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Kovač left Hertha after three seasons for Austrian Bundesliga side Red Bull Salzburg. He was a regular in the Salzburg team and also appeared in all of their four UEFA Champions League qualifiers in the summer of 2006. On 26 August 2006, he scored his first goal for Red Bull Salzburg in the Bundesliga, netting the second goal in their 4–0 home victory over Wacker Tirol. He signed one more year until summer 2009 in May 2008. On 29 May 2009, Kovač left after three years with Red Bull and retired from professional football. He played his last match for Red Bull in a friendly against former club Bayern Munich; he was substituted off after the first 15 minutes.

==International career==
Kovač made his senior international debut in Croatia&#x27;s friendly match against Morocco on 11 December 1996 in Casablanca. He subsequently also appeared in three qualifying matches for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, but missed the finals in France because he did not fully recover from injury until the beginning of the preparations for the tournament. He was subsequently not part of the national team for two years before making his comeback in a friendly match against France in November 1999.

At international level, Kovač played for Croatia in five qualifying matches for the 2002 World Cup and scored one goal in Croatia&#x27;s 4–0 victory away against San Marino. At the final tournament, he appeared as a starting player in all three group matches before Croatia was eliminated from the tournament with a third-place finish in their group. He was also a regular in UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying, making seven appearances and scoring two goals in away matches, the 1–0 winner against Estonia and the opening goal in the team&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Andorra. He also played the entire three group matches played by the Croatian team at the final Euro 2004 tournament in Portugal and scored the opening goal in the final group match against England. However, Croatia lost the match 4–2 and was once again eliminated from the tournament as the third-placed nation in its group.

After Euro 2004, Kovač became the Croatia national team&#x27;s captain and led the team through the qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals in Germany. He appeared in nine of ten qualifying matches and scored two goals, both in Croatia&#x27;s 4–0 victory over Iceland at home in Zagreb. At the final tournament, he appeared in all three of Croatia&#x27;s group matches, despite sustaining an injury which forced him to leave the pitch after 40 minutes of the team&#x27;s opening match against Brazil. Kovač scored the goal that put Croatia 2–1 up in the final group match against Australia. However, the match ended in a 2–2 draw and Croatia was eliminated by virtue of finishing third in the group. This was the third consecutive time this had happened in a major tournament.

Euro 2008 was a bittersweet campaign for captain Kovač. His sterling performances against Germany and Turkey ultimately unrewarded in what proved to be his last major tournament. Against Germany, he was peerless, producing a man of the match display alongside Luka Modrić whilst against Turkey, he reduced his opponents to pot shots from distance as they rarely broke through his protection of the back four. Before and after that game, Kovač reiterated his intention to retire from international football at the end of Euro 2008, however, after conversation with Slaven Bilić, it would seem he feels there is &quot;unfinished business&quot; to take care of.

Kovač finally announced his international retirement on 7 January 2009, stating a desire that younger players should be given experience in the Croatia side.

==Coaching career==
===Red Bull Salzburg (2009–2011)===

After his retirement from professional football, Kovač became coach of the second squad of Red Bull Salzburg, Red Bull Juniors, from 16 June 2009 to 7 April 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;RB Salzburg (A)/FC Anif » Manager history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009–10 season, he finished in sixth place and were knocked out in the Austrian Cup in the second round in a shootout. He was with the second team until 7 April 2011. His final match was a 1–1 draw against SV Seekirchen. In 2011, he was promoted to being assistant coach of the first squad together with Ricardo Moniz as head coach. After Moniz resigned as a first-team coach in June 2012, Kovač was one of the favourites for taking his position. However, the position went to Roger Schmidt and Kovač subsequently left Salzburg.

===Croatia (2013–2015)===
====Under-21====
On 21 January 2013, Igor Štimac, head coach of the Croatia national team, announced that Kovač, alongside his brother Robert as assistant coach, would take over as the under-21 team head coach. His task was to qualify for the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Croatia were drawn in Group 5 of the qualifying competition, together with Switzerland, Ukraine, Latvia and Liechtenstein. In the first four games, Croatia got the maximum of 12 points with a goal difference of 13–0. He debuted with a 5–0 away win against Liechtenstein, before he brought two away wins against the group favourites Ukraine and Switzerland.

====Senior====

On 16 October 2013, Davor Šuker, president of the Croatian Football Federation (HNS), announced that Niko Kovač would take over as caretaker manager of the Croatia senior team. He replaced Štimac, who was sacked after Croatia scraped into the World Cup play-offs having taken only one point from their last four qualifiers. However, one day later, in an inaugural press conference, Šuker stated HNS signed a two-year contract with Kovač and his staff including his brother Robert Kovač, Vatroslav Mihačić and Goran Lacković, until the end of Croatia&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2016 campaign. His first two matches for Croatia were in the World Cup play-offs against Iceland. Croatia managed to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil after winning the play-off tie against Iceland 2–0 on aggregate. At the World Cup, Croatia won 4–0 against Cameroon and lost 3–1 against Brazil and Mexico. Croatia did not qualify from their group. On 9 September 2015, HNS terminated Kovač&#x27;s contract after Croatia lost 2–0 to Norway in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying.

===Eintracht Frankfurt (2016–2018)===
Kovač was appointed as head coach of Eintracht Frankfurt on 8 March 2016. He made his managerial debut for Frankfurt in a 3–0 loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach. The club was only able to finish the season in 16th place, requiring them to play in the relegation play-offs against 1. FC Nürnberg. After drawing the first leg 1–1 at home, Kovač ensured Eintracht&#x27;s survival in the Bundesliga after Haris Seferovic&#x27;s goal won the second leg 1–0. Kovač received a Fair Play Prize from the DOSB for his gesture of comforting Nürnberg&#x27;s players after their defeat.

In the 2016–17 season, Frankfurt managed to finish mid-table in eleventh position, as well as notably reaching the 2017 DFB-Pokal Final, club&#x27;s first final since 2006, where Frankfurt lost 1–2 against Borussia Dortmund. In the 2017–18 season, Frankfurt competed for a place in European competition for the following season. Kovač has typically used a 3–4–2–1 formation with emphasis on defensive stability and wing play. He took Frankfurt to the 2018 DFB-Pokal Final, the second in succession for the club, where he beat his future employer, Bayern Munich. With that win, Kovač led Frankfurt to its first trophy since 1988. He finished with a record of 38 wins, 20 draws and 33 losses in 91 matches. Adi Hütter became his successor.

===Bayern Munich (2018–2019)===

On 13 April 2018, Bayern Munich announced that Kovač would succeed Jupp Heynckes as head coach of the club for the 2018–19 season, with a three-year contract lasting until 30 June 2021. Kovač&#x27;s brother, Robert, would follow him to Munich to be his assistant coach. Kovač had a contract with Frankfurt until 30 June 2018 and Bayern had to pay a release clause in his contract reported to be around €2.2 million. Kovač is just the fourth former player to manage Bayern Munich after Søren Lerby, Franz Beckenbauer and Jürgen Klinsmann. Kovač was the third Croatian to manage Bayern after Zlatko Čajkovski and Branko Zebec.

On 12 August, Kovač won his first match as coach of Bayern 5–0 in the German Super Cup against his former club, Eintracht Frankfurt. He won his first Bundesliga game in charge as Bayern defeated 1899 Hoffenheim 3–1 at home on 25 August. On 19 May 2019, he led Bayern to their seventh consecutive Bundesliga title after a 5–1 home win against his former club, Eintracht Frankfurt, beating nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund by two points. This was Kovač&#x27;s first Bundesliga title as a coach.

On 25 May 2019, Kovač led Bayern to a league and cup double when Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final. It was Kovač&#x27;s second consecutive cup win as he became the first coach since Felix Magath in 2005 and 2006 to win back-to-back cup titles. Kovač also became the first person to win a league and cup double both as a player and coach in German football. On 1 October, Bayern defeated Tottenham Hotspur 7–2 in the Champions League, with Serge Gnabry scoring four goals. It was Bayern&#x27;s second highest victory in European competitions, only behind their 7–1 victory over Roma in October 2014. On 3 November, Kovač left by mutual agreement after a 5–1 loss to his former club, Eintracht Frankfurt.

===Monaco (2020–2022)===
On 19 July 2020, Kovač was appointed as head coach at Ligue 1 club Monaco. In his first game as Monaco coach on 23 August, Kovač secured a 2–2 draw after being two goals down against Reims. On 20 November, Monaco beat French champions and Champions League finalists Paris Saint-Germain 3–2 after falling behind 0–2. On 21 February 2021, he defeated Paris Saint-Germain once again, this time 2–0. It was the first time since March 2016 that Monaco won at Parc des Princes. Kovač was subsequently widely praised by French sports media. On 19 May, Monaco lost 2–0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the Coupe de France Final. On 1 January 2022, Monaco announced the departure of Kovač.

===VfL Wolfsburg (2022–2024)===
VfL Wolfsburg announced the appointment of Kovač on 24 May 2022 marking his return to the Bundesliga after three years. He was sacked in March 2024.

===Borussia Dortmund===
Kovač signed an 18-month deal with Borussia Dortmund on 29 January 2025.

==Managerial style==
Throughout his career at various clubs, Kovac has implemented a mix of 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 formations with a clear focus on how the team plays without possession. He works on increasing his team&#x27;s intensity behind the ball so they are able to defend in a compact, mid-high press to force their opponents wide. As soon as they would win the ball, they make use of their quick players in fast transitions.

==Personal life==
Kovač was born on 15 October 1971 in Wedding, West Berlin, to a Herzegovinian Croat family hailing from Livno, Bosnia and Herzegovina. His parents Mato and Ivka emigrated from SFR Yugoslavia to West Germany in 1970 as part of the gastarbeiter program. He has two younger siblings, brother Robert and sister Nikolina. Kovač is also a German national and therefore he was eligible to represent Germany, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina at international level. He opted for Croatia.

Kovač married his primary school sweetheart in 1999. They have a daughter named Laura. Kovač is a Roman Catholic. He generally lives a quiet family life, and considers a family of great value and tries to convey that to his players.

In 2007, Kovač appeared in Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ)&#x27;s campaign video for that year&#x27;s parliamentary election. The video focuses on Croatian diaspora&#x27;s right to vote, and depicts Kovač talking about his connection with his homeland. One of the lines from the video, &quot;&quot; (&quot;My brother Robert, as well&quot;), entered Croatian popular culture and is frequently quoted by the people and the media in the country when referring to the brothers.

<doc id="742406" wikidata="Q179002" url="?curid=742406" title="G1 Beijing–Harbin Expressway">
<text>The Beijing–Harbin Expressway (), designated as G1 and commonly abbreviated as Jingha Expressway () is an expressway linking the cities of Beijing and Harbin, Heilongjiang.

The Beijing–Harbin Expressway is commonly referred to as the Jingha Expressway. This name is derived from the two one-character Chinese abbreviations of the two cities at which the expressway terminates, &quot;Jing&quot; for Beijing and &quot;Ha&quot; for Harbin.

==Route==
The Beijing–Harbin Expressway runs from Beijing, the national capital, to Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province. It passes through the following major cities:
* Beijing
* Langfang, Hebei
* Tianjin
* Tangshan, Hebei
* Qinhuangdao, Hebei
* Huludao, Liaoning
* Jinzhou, Liaoning
* Shenyang, Liaoning
* Siping, Jilin
* Changchun, Jilin
* Harbin, Heilongjiang

==History==
The first section of the Beijing–Harbin Expressway, opened in the 1990s was the short-lived Jingqin Expressway, running between the outskirts of Beijing and Qinhuangdao.

In the 1990s the expressway was extended northeast from Qinhuangdao to Shenyang and westward to the 4th Ring Road in Beijing to become the Jingshen Expressway. The 658 km expressway from central Beijing to Shenyang was completed in time for the 50th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It opened to the general motoring public on September 15, 1999, after four years of work on different sections.

The expressway was extended to Harbin during the rapid expansion of the Chinese expressway system in the 2000s. The completed expressway was opened on September 28, 2001. It is now one of the seven radial expressways emanating from Beijing.

Improvements were made to the expressway in 2003 and 2004 by removing several toll stations in 2003 and repairing the previously uneven road surface between the 6th Ring Road and Xijizhen in Beijing in 2004.

On October 8, 2004, 36 vehicles were involved a horrendous series of car crashes on the expressway. The crashes occurred in the westbound lanes near the interchange with the Jinji Expressway, in the Tianjin municipality. Traffic was delayed up for over one and a half hours.

==Toll network==
When the expressway opened in September 1999, there was a large amount of complaints about the number of toll booths. In some cases, a toll booth appeared every 15 kilometres.

The Jingshen expressway was constructed by several different organisations, and as a result, each organization set up their own toll gate. This made the route slow to travel on, as traffic piled up in front of toll gates.

The PRC Ministry of Communications declared that, effective September 1, 2003, the Baodi toll gate in Tianjin and the Yutian toll gate in Hebei would be demolished, in order to create a networked toll system. Additionally, two expressway toll gates near Shanhaiguan would be merged as one. These plans also suggested that the toll gate at Bailu, Beijing, just east of the Eastern 5th Ring Road, would be demolished as well, as soon as Beijing finished joining the networked toll system. The toll gate at Xianghe in Hebei, however, would be kept.

Thus, for the section from Xianghe in western Hebei through to Shanhaiguan in eastern Hebei (and even through the Tianjin portion), this networked toll system applies—one of the first of its kind. This does away with the previous system, where toll booths appeared every time the jurisdiction changed. For some odd reason, Beijing and Liaoning are still not part of the networked toll system.

China plans to expand the networked toll system nationwide, starting with the Jingshen expressway as a testing ground. The changes have been accepted positively. Average speed on the expressway has gone up, and the Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China raised maximum speed limits on expressways nationwide from 110 km/h to 120 km/h. These improvements have made traffic jams far less frequent.

<text>Unigenitus (named for its Latin opening words &quot;Unigenitus Dei Filius&quot;, or &quot;Only-begotten Son of God&quot;) is an apostolic constitution in the form of a papal bull promulgated by Pope Clement XI in 1713. It opened the final phase of the Jansenist controversy in France. &quot;Unigenitus&quot; censured 101 propositions of Pasquier Quesnel as:

==Background==
In 1671 Pasquier Quesnel had published a book entitled &quot;Abrégé de la morale de l&#x27;Evangile&quot; (&quot;Morality of the Gospel, Abridged&quot;). It contained the four Gospels in French, with short explanatory notes, serving as aids for meditation. The work was approved by the bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne. Enlarged editions followed, containing an annotated French text of the complete New Testament, in 1678 and 1693–1694. This last edition was highly recommended by the new bishop of Châlons, Louis Antoine de Noailles. While the first edition of the work contained only a few Jansenist points, its tendency became more apparent in the second edition, and in its complete form, as it appeared in 1693, it was – in the words of the 1912 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; – &quot;pervaded with practically all the errors of Jansenism&quot;.

Several bishops forbade it to be read, and Clement XI condemned it in a brief, July 13, 1708, which was, however, not accepted in France, because its wording and its manner of publication were not in harmony with the accepted prerogatives of the Gallican church. Noailles, who had become Archbishop of Paris and cardinal meanwhile, and who in 1702 discarded a relic that had long been venerated at Châlons as the umbilical cord of Jesus, was not prepared to withdraw the approbation which he had given to the book, and Jansenism again raised its head.

==Production==
To put an end to this situation several bishops, supported by Louis XIV himself, asked the Pope to issue a bull in place of the unacceptable brief. The Bull would have to avoid every expression contrary to the &quot;Gallican Liberties&quot; and to be submitted to the French government before publication. To avoid further scandal, Clement yielded to these humiliating conditions, and in February 1712, appointed a special congregation of cardinals and theologians to cull from the work of Quesnel such propositions as were deserving of ecclesiastical censure. The most influential member of this congregation was Cardinal Agostino Fabroni.

The bull, which was produced with the contribution of a committee including Cardinal Fabroni and Gregorio Selleri, lector at the College of Saint Thomas, rejected 101 propositions from the &quot;Réflexions morales&quot; of Quesnel as heretical, and as reviving propositions already condemned in the writings of Jansen.

It took the congregation eighteen months to complete its task, the result of which was published as the Bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot; at Rome on 8 September 1713.

== Content ==
The Bull begins with Christ&#x27;s warning against false prophets, especially such as &quot;secretly spread evil doctrines under the guise of piety and introduce ruinous sects under the image of sanctity&quot;.

It then lists 101 condemned propositions which are taken verbatim from the last edition of Quesnel&#x27;s work, with the Bible verses the Quesnel used to justify the proposition. For example: grace works with omnipotence and is irresistible; without grace man can only commit sin; Christ died for the elect only; every love that is not supernatural is evil; without supernatural love there can be no hope in God, no obedience to His law, no good work, no prayer, no merit, no religion; the prayer of the sinner and his other good acts performed out of fear of punishment are only new sins; the Church comprises only the just and the elect; the reading of the Bible is for all; sacramental absolution should be postponed till after satisfaction; the chief pastors can exercise the Church&#x27;s power of excommunication only with the consent, at least presumed, of the whole body of the Church; unjust excommunication does not exclude the excommunicated from union with the Church.

The Bull also condemns such things as that the reading of Sacred Scripture is for all, that it is useful and necessary at all times, in all places, and for every kind of person, to study and to know the spirit, the piety, and the mysteries of Sacred Scripture, and that its sacred obscurity is no reason for the laity to dispense themselves from reading it, and that doing so is harmful. (79–81, 83–86)

The Bull finds fault with many other statements in the book of Quesnel, without, however, specifying them, and, in particular, with the translation of the New Testament, which, as the Bull reads, has been censurably altered (&quot;damnabiliter vitiatum&quot;) and is in many ways similar to a previously condemned French translation.

==Reception==
According to John McManners, &quot;The complicated diplomatic manoeuvring leading to its promulgation was prompted by the Jesuits and their sympathizers, enemies of Noailles, and by the aged Louis XIV, which wished to destroy the Jansenists as ‘a republican party in Church and State’, while upholding the independence of the Gallican Church&quot;.
Louis XIV received the Bull at Fontainebleau on 24 September 1713, and sent a copy to Cardinal Noailles, who, probably before receiving it, had revoked, on September 28, his approbation of the &quot;Moral Reflections&quot; given in 1695. The king also convoked the French clergy to convene at Paris to accept the bull.

At the first session, Noailles appointed a committee presided over by Cardinal Rohan of Strasburg to decide upon the most suitable manner of accepting the Bull. Noailles&#x27;s attempts to prevent an unconditional acceptance proved fruitless and the bull was accepted and officially registered. But a pastoral instruction of Noailles forbade his priests under pain of suspension to accept the Bull without his authorization; that was condemned by Rome. The bishops of France were divided. The Pope felt that his authority was threatened and intended to summon Noailles before the Curia and, if needs be, dismiss him from the cardinalate. But the king and his councillors, seeing in this mode of procedure a trespass upon the &quot;Gallican Liberties&quot;, proposed instead the convocation of a national council which would judge and pass sentence upon Noailles and his faction.

==Aftermath==
The Pope did not relish the idea of convoking a national council, which might unnecessarily protract the quarrel and endanger the papal authority. He, however, drew up two briefs, the one demanding the unconditional acceptance of the bull by Louis Antoine de Noailles within fifteen days, on pain of turning in the red hat (sign of his rank as cardinal) and incurring canonical punishment, the other more paternally pointing out the gravity of the cardinal&#x27;s offence. Both briefs were put in the hand of the king, with the request to deliver the less severe text should there be a well-founded hope of the cardinal&#x27;s speedy submission. In fact, Noailles gave no hope of submission, while, on the other, the more severe of the Briefs was rejected by the king as subversive of the &quot;Gallican Liberties&quot;. Louis XIV, therefore, again pressed for the convocation of a national council, but died September 1, 1715, before it could be convened.

Philippe II of Orléans, now Regent of France, favoured the opponents of the Bull. The Sorbonne passed a resolution on January 4, 1716, annulling its previous registration of the Bull, and twenty-two Sorbonnists who protested were removed from the faculty. The Universities of Nantes and Rheims now also rejected the Bull. In consequence on November 1 Clement XI withdrew from the Sorbonne all the papal privileges which it possessed and attempted to deprive it of the power of conferring academic degrees.

Clement XI had sent two Briefs to France on May 1, 1716. One, addressed to the regent, severely reproved him for favouring the opponents of the Bull; the other, addressed to the opposition, threatened to deprive Noailles of the purple, and to proceed canonically against all who would not accept the Bull within two months. These Briefs were not accepted by the regent because their text had not been previously submitted to his ministers. But he sent to Rome, Chevalier, the Jansenist Vicar-General of Meaux whom the Pope did not, however, admit to his presence, when it became known that his sole purpose was to wrest the admission from Clement XI that the Bull was obscure and required an explanation. In a consistory held on June 27, 1716, the Pope delivered a passionate allocution, lasting three hours, in which he informed the cardinals of the treatment which the Bull had received in France, and expressed his purpose of divesting Noailles of the cardinalate. The following November he sent two new Briefs to France, one to the regent, whose co-operation he asked in suppressing the opposition to the Bull; the other to the acceptants, whom he warned against the intrigues of the recalcitrants, and requested to exhort their erring brethren to give up their resistance.

On March 1, 1717, four bishops (Soanen of Senez, de La Broue of Mirepoix, Colbert of Montpellier and Delangle of Boulogne) drew up an appeal from the Bull to a general council, thus founding the party hereafter known as the &quot;appellants&quot;. Between March 5 and May 13, they were joined by the faculties of the Sorbonne, of Rheims, and Nantes; likewise by the Bishops of Verdun, Pamiers, Châlons, Condom, Agen and St. Malo, and Auxerre; and more than a year later by the Bishops of Laon, Bayonne and Angoulême.

Though a personal letter of the Pope, dated March 25, and a joint letter of the cardinals at Rome urgently implored Noailles to submit, he also drew up an appeal on April 3, &quot;from the pope manifestly mistaken, and from the Constitution &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, in virtue of the decrees of the Councils of Constance and Basle, to the Pope better informed and to a general council to be held without constraint and in a safe place&quot;. He did not, however, publish his appeal for the present, but deposited it in the archives of the &quot;officialité&quot; of Paris. On May 6, he wrote a long letter to the Pope, in which he endeavours to justify his position and that of his adherents. A few months later his appeal from the Bull was published. The appellants were soon joined by many priests and religious, especially from the Dioceses of Paris and Rheims. To swell the list of appellants the names of laymen and even laywomen were accepted. The number of appellants is said to have reached 1,800 to 2,000, pitifully small for the approximately 1,500,000 livres ($300,000) distributed as bribes.

On March 8, 1718, appeared a Decree of the Inquisition, approved by Clement XI, which condemned the appeal of the four bishops as schismatic and heretical, and that of Noailles as schismatic and approaching to heresy. Since they did not withdraw their appeal within a reasonable time, the Pope issued the Bull &quot;Pastoralis officii&quot; on August 28, 1718, excommunicating all that refused to accept the Bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;. But they appealed also from this second Bull. Noailles finally made an ambiguous submission on 13 March 1720, by signing an explanation of the Bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, drawn up by order of the French secretary of State, Guillaume Cardinal Dubois, and, later, approved by ninety-five bishops.

After much pressure from the king of France and the bishops, Noailles made public this ambiguous acceptance of the Bull in his pastoral instruction of November 18, 1720. But this did not satisfy Clement XI, who required an unconditional acceptance. After the death of Clement XI, March 19, 1721, the appellants continued in their obstinacy during the pontificates of Innocent XIII (1721–1724) and Benedict XIII (1724–1730). Noailles, the soul of the opposition, finally made a sincere and unconditional submission on October 11, 1728, and died soon after (May 2, 1729). The Apostolic See, in concerted action with the new Archbishop of Paris, Vintimille, and the French Government, gradually brought about the submission of most of the appellants.

<doc id="742427" wikidata="Q863681" url="?curid=742427" title="Kawarau River">
<text>The Kawarau River is a river in the South Island of New Zealand. It drains Lake Wakatipu in northwestern Otago via the lake&#x27;s Frankton Arm. The river flows generally eastwards for about and passes through the steep Kawarau Gorge until it joins Lake Dunstan near Cromwell. Before the construction of the Clyde High Dam, the Kawarau joined the Clutha River / Mata-Au in a spectacular confluence at Cromwell. The Shotover River enters the Kawarau from the north; the Nevis River enters it from the south. With many rapids and strong currents, the river can be dangerous and has claimed many lives. It is popular for bungy jumping and kayaking.

A natural bridge, , where the river narrows to , was important first to early Māori and then to goldminers as the only place the Mata-Au and the Kawarau could be crossed without boats. Māori were heading for the Cardrona Valley to reach Wānaka, and on to the Haast Pass to seek pounamu. The miners were seeking gold in the Arrow Goldfields.

Now the main road to Queenstown, State Highway 6, runs through the Kawarau Gorge.

==Name==
Kawarau is a Māori name meaning &quot;channel between rocks or shoals&quot;. It shares its name with the mountain range at its source.

It is pronounced &#x27;ka wa ro&#x27;, and has its etymological roots in the Waitaha or southern dialect of Māori. It should not be confused with the Bay of Plenty town of Kawerau.

The falls where the river leaves Whakatipu Waimāori are called Ōterotu.

==History==
For Ngāi Tahu, the river was the main travel route from the Mata-Au to Lake Wakatipu. A key feature was the narrow gorge at or , the only place where the Kawarau and Mata-Au rivers could be leapt over. It connected to a route over the Crown Range and on to the Cardrona Valley that led to the West Coast.

In the 19th century, alluvial gold was extracted from the river. The Goldfields Mining Centre, downstream of the gorge, features a working exhibition of 19th century gold mining techniques. Some of the miners&#x27; huts remain today, many of them close to thriving vineyards.

In 1924 a company was formed to drain the river by blocking off Lake Wakatipu, with the intent of then collecting gold from the river bed. Ten massive gates were completed in 1927 and although the river level dropped it was not laid bare as planned. The gates formed part of State Highway 6 until December 2017, when a larger $22 million replacement bridge was completed.

== Water Conservation Order ==
A water conservation order was set up in March 1997, seven years after the minister of conservation first applied for an agreement to prevent hydroelectric dams from being built in the Kawarau river or its tributaries.

The Order covers the stretch of river from the Lake Wakatipu control gates to Scrubby Stream. Fish and Game has sought an amendment to the Water Conservation Order to prevent any damming of the Nevis River and to seek conditions on changes to the minimum flows.

==Adventure tourism==

The first European to visit the area was Nathanael Chalmers, who was guided inland by Chiefs Reko and Kaikōura in 1853. Reko and Kaikōura showed Chalmers the rock bridge at Roaring Meg, which was the only place that the Kawarau River could be crossed, and returned him down the river on a , a flax reed open kayak. In 1910, 57 years after the event, Nathanael Chalmers remembered his boat trip through the Cromwell Gorge: ‘I shall never forget the “race” through the gorge ... my heart was literally in my mouth, but those two old men seemed to care nothing for the current.’ 

More recent tourist adventure activities on the river include riverboarding, jet boating, white water rafting, river surfing, and bungy jumping. The Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge, above the river, and a Category I historic place, is the site of the world&#x27;s first commercial bungy jumping operation. Eastburn Station gave up the plus that forms the natural backdrop as a reserve.

The Kawarau is the largest volume river commercially rafted in New Zealand, with an average flow of at Chards Road measuring station. The four significant commercially used rapids on the river are Smiths Falls, Twin Bridges, Do Little Do Nothing and the Chinese Dog Leg. Below these are the dangerous Nevis Bluff, Citroen, Retrospect, and Roaring Meg sections. Because of the danger Waitiri Station usually declines access.

==In popular culture==
The Kawarau featured as a setting for the Argonath in the 2001 motion picture, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

The Kawarau appeared on the finale of the Israeli reality show &quot;HaMerotz LaMillion 1&quot;.

Frederick John Cato of the firm Moran &amp; Cato, was a teacher from Invercargill, New Zealand, where he met and married Frances Bethune. &quot;Kawarau&quot; was the name they gave their expansive home in Hawthorn East, Victoria.

==Bridges==
Bridges that pass over the Kawarau River are:
* Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge
* Kawarau River Bridge
* Kawarau River (Victoria) Bridge
* Kawarau Falls Bridge
* Bridge at the Goldfields Mining Centre

Until it was destroyed in the 19th century, the natural rock bridge &quot;Whatatorere&quot; at Roaring Meg was the only place that the Kawarau River or Clutha River could be crossed without boats.

<doc id="742431" wikidata="Q372487" url="?curid=742431" title="Contact print">
<text>A contact print is a photographic image produced from film; sometimes from a film negative, and sometimes from a film positive or paper negative. In a darkroom an exposed and developed piece of film or photographic paper is placed emulsion side down, in contact with a piece of photographic paper, light is briefly shone through the negative or paper and then the paper is developed to reveal the final print.

The defining characteristic of a contact print is that the resulting print is the same size as the original, rather than having been projected through an enlarger.

== Basic tools ==
Contact printing is a simple and inexpensive process. Its simplicity avails itself to those who may want to try darkroom processing without buying an enlarger. One or more negatives are placed on a sheet of photographic paper which is briefly exposed to a light source. The light may come from a low wattage frosted bulb hanging above an easel which holds them together, or contained in an exposure box with a plate of frosted glass on top. Accurate timing of the light comes with experience, but only a little experimenting leads to positive results. The negative and the photographic paper are placed on the glass plate of the exposure box. A hinged top-cover presses the negatives in close contact with the paper and keeps them in place. The paper is then developed and the result is called a contact print.
After exposure, the paper is processed using chemicals in the darkroom to produce the final print. The paper must be placed in a film developer bath, a stop bath, fixer, and finally the hypo-eliminator bath, in that order. Failure to adhere precisely to this process will result in a poor-quality final image with a variety of issues.

Ansel Adams describes procedures for making contact prints using ordinary lighting in his book, &quot;The Print&quot;.

== Proof sheets ==

Since this process produces neither enlargements nor reductions, the image on the print is exactly the same size as the image on the negative. Contact prints are used to produce proof sheets from entire rolls of 35 mm negative (from 135 film cassettes) and 120 (2 film rolls) in order to aid in the selection of images for further enlargement, and for cataloging and identification purposes. For 120 roll film (once a common negative size for popular cameras) and larger film, contact prints are often used to determine the final print size. In medium and large format photography, contact prints are prized for their extreme fidelity to the negative, with exquisite detail that can be seen with the use of a magnifying glass. A disadvantage to using contact prints in the fine-arts is the laboriousness of modifying exposure selectively, when the use of an enlarger can achieve the same purpose.

Because light does not pass any significant distance through the air or through lenses in going from the negative to the print, the contact process ideally preserves all the detail that is present in the negative. However, the exposure value (EV) range, the variation from darkest to lightest regions, is inherently greater in negatives than in prints.

== Finished prints ==
When large format film is contact printed to create finished work, it is possible, but not easy, to use local controls to interpret the image on the negative. &quot;Burning&quot; and &quot;dodging&quot; (either increasing the amount of light that one area of the print receives, or decreasing the amount of light in order to achieve the ideal tonal range in a particular area) require painstaking work with photographic masks, or the use of a production contact printing machine (Arkay, Morse, Burke and James are manufacturers who make contact printing machines).

Some alternative processes or non-silver processes, such as van Dyke and cyanotype printing, must be contact printed. Medium or large format negatives are almost always used for these types of printing. Images from smaller formats may be transferred to a larger format negative for this purpose.

== Production tools ==
Contact printing machines are more elaborate devices than the more familiar and widely available contact printing frames. They typically combine in a box the light source, intermediate glass stages, and a final glass stage for the negative and paper to be placed upon, as well as an elastic pressure plate to keep the negative and the paper in tight contact. Dodging can be accomplished by placing fine tissue paper on the intermediate glass stages between the light source and the negative/paper sandwich to modify the exposure locally. The benefit to such time intensive techniques is the ability to then make multiple prints with negligible variation, at full production speed.

== Other uses for the technique ==
Contact printing was also once used in photolithography, and in printed circuit manufacturing.

Motion picture prints are often contact printed either from an original, or a duplicate negative.

The contact exposure process usually refers to a film negative used in conjunction with printing paper, but the process may be used with any transparent or translucent original image printed by contact onto a light sensitive material. Negatives or positives on film or even paper may for various purposes be used to make contact exposures onto different films and papers. Intermediary products such as internegatives, interpositives, enlarged negatives, and contrast controlling masks are often made using contact exposures.
Computer screens and other electronic display devices provide an alternative approach to contact printing. A permanent image (negative, positive film or transparency, or translucent original) is not used, instead the light sensitive material is exposed directly to the display device in a dark room for a controllable duration. The resulting image generated by this mixed digital/analogue technique has been coined &quot;laptopogram&quot;. While limited by the image display device resolution, which can be much inferior to film negatives, the widespread use of electronic displays provides great potential to this unorthodox contact printing method.

In contact sheet photography, the traditional contact sheet is used as a way to make pictures consisting of partial photos. The resulting image spans the whole sheet, divided into squares by the black borders of the film.

== Artistic and practical considerations ==
Photographers praise the beautiful intermediate gray or color gradation that results from making prints this way. Each print is necessarily the same size as the corresponding image on the negative. This makes contact prints from large-format negatives, especially 5×7 inch and larger, most usable for fine-art work. Smaller contact prints, from films and formats such as 135 film cassettes, 35 mm (24×36 mm images), and 120/220 roll film (6 cm), are useful for evaluation of exposure, composition, and subject.

It is cheaper and easier to avoid making conventional prints of all the exposures with an enlarger; the photographer prints only the best negatives. Selection is usually made using a loupe — a special magnifying glass with a transparent base — to examine the tiny prints, still aligned as they are on the negative strips. Negatives themselves can be examined with a loupe, but blacks and whites are the reverse of what is seen through the view finder (hence: a negative), which makes it more difficult to interpret the images. Contact sheets can easily be stored in files in the dark, along with the negatives.

== Notable photographers ==
Edward Weston made most of his pictures using contact print technique.

<text>Michael John Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn, (3 July 1945 – 29 April 2018) was a Scottish politician who served as Speaker of the House of Commons between 2000 and 2009. A member of the Labour Party prior to becoming speaker, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Springburn from 1979 to 2005 and for Glasgow North East until 2009. He was elected as Speaker of the House of Commons in 2000, remaining in the office for nine years until his involuntary resignation in 2009.

On his election to the post of Speaker in 2000, he was the first Catholic to serve in the role since the Reformation. He resigned from the position on 21 June 2009, as a result of diminishing parliamentary and public confidence owing to his role in the expenses scandal. He stood down from the House of Commons on the following day.

==Early life==
Martin was born on 3 July 1945 in William Street in Glasgow, the son of a merchant seaman and a school cleaner. He was one of five children, and was brought up in a tenement community in Anderston. The family later moved to Springburn when Michael was fourteen years old. He attended St Patrick&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School, leaving a few days before his fifteenth birthday to become an apprentice sheet metal worker at a factory called Heatovent. He worked at a railway yard in Springburn for the train engine makers North British Caledonian Railways and became involved in the National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Coppersmiths. He joined the Labour Party when aged 21. He worked as a sheet-metal worker with Rolls-Royce from 1960 to 1976, and worked at the plant at Hillington. By his mid-twenties, he was a full-time shop steward with the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers.

At the age of 27, in 1973, Martin was elected as a Labour councillor of the Glasgow Corporation, representing the Fairfield ward in the Govan area. In 1974, he was elected to the City of Glasgow District Council, representing the Balornock ward. He was a trade union organiser with the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) between 1976 and 1979.

==Early parliamentary career==
In 1978, Martin was selected by the Labour Party out of five prospective candidates to replace Richard Buchanan. He was elected as the Member of Parliament for Glasgow Springburn at the 1979 general election. He was a supporter of Roy Hattersley and Denis Healey, who were ideologically on the right-wing of the party and with whom he served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary from 1980 to 1983. He was re-elected in 1983, 1987, 1992 and 1997. Associated with the right wing of the Labour Party, he was socially conservative on issues such as abortion and homosexuality. In 1994, he was one of thirteen Labour MPs who voted against the reduction of the age of consent for homosexuals from 21 to 18.

He served as Chairman of the Scottish Grand Committee from 1987 to 1997. He sat on the Speaker&#x27;s Panel of Chairmen 1987–2000. He was appointed as First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means (one of three Deputy Speakers) in May 1997. Unusually, despite a long Commons career of 30 years, Martin never sat on the government benches, as his party was out of office during his time as a backbencher, and then returned to power as he was elevated to the Deputy Speakership.

==Speakership==
In 2000, Betty Boothroyd retired as Speaker. An election was held in October of that year and twelve MPs put their names forward as potential successors. Many observers had considered the Conservative MP George Young to be the favourite as he had support from both the Conservative and Labour leadership, who viewed it as the Conservatives&#x27; &#x27;turn&#x27; to have a Speaker elected from their benches. However, many backbench MPs, particularly those from the Labour Party (who held a large majority in the House at the time), viewed Young as being not sufficiently in touch with ordinary MPs because he had very recently been a member of his party&#x27;s front bench team. (Young had stepped down from the Shadow Cabinet just before the election for a new Speaker and had been a member of the Cabinet in the Conservative government during the previous parliament.) In the end, the contest was determined by a series of votes that were held during a process that lasted more than six hours on 23 October 2000. Martin&#x27;s rivals were eliminated one by one and Young&#x27;s candidacy was rejected by the House.

Martin was elected as the 156th Speaker on 23 October 2000, becoming the first Catholic to serve in the role since the Reformation. In accordance with a long-standing convention, Martin resigned from the Labour Party. He eschewed some of the traditional clothing associated with the Speaker&#x27;s role, appearing without wig, silk stockings and knee breeches. His Glaswegian accent led to his being nicknamed &quot;Gorbals Mick&quot; by Quentin Letts, after the working-class district of Glasgow, although he was actually born on the other side of the river from the Gorbals and represented a constituency a few miles away.

Martin&#x27;s initial appointment as Speaker occurred against a recent pattern in the House where the post of Speaker had alternated between the two main political parties (the Conservative Party and the Labour Party). As his predecessor, Betty Boothroyd, had been a Labour MP, the new Speaker had been expected to emerge from the Conservative benches.

Martin was re-elected as an MP in the 2001 general election, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats not challenging him but the Scottish National Party (SNP) achieving a small swing towards its candidate. After being returned in the general election, he did not face a contest for the chair—no previous speakers that were returned to the Commons after a general election have. He was re-elected as Speaker, with Young nominating him.

Although the House of Commons has long held a yearly hannukiah lighting ceremony at the official residence of the Speaker, it never had its own hannukiah and had to borrow one from the local Jewish community every year; despite being a Catholic, Martin arranged in 2003 for the House to have its own hannukiah, which is still used every year. Coincidentally, his successor John Bercow would become the first Jewish Speaker of the House six years later.

In the 2005 general election, he stood in the new constituency of Glasgow North East, with the SNP again fielding a candidate against him. He was returned to Parliament. He was unopposed in the election to be Speaker. Shortly after the 2005 election, when the Liberal Democrat MP Patsy Calton entered the Commons for the last time to affirm her allegiance from a wheelchair and sign the register, Martin broke with tradition and left the Speaker&#x27;s Chair to shake her hand and kiss her on the cheek, saying &quot;Welcome home Patsy.&quot; Calton, who had just been re-elected, had terminal breast cancer and died three days later.

On 17 February 2006, Martin had angioplasty at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary for blocked coronary arteries. His office confirmed this on 26 February and indicated that he would be absent from his duties for several weeks. He returned to the chair on 18 April.

===Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions===
On 1 November 2006, during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, Martin caused uproar in the House of Commons by ruling out of order a question from Opposition Leader David Cameron in which he challenged Prime Minister Tony Blair over the future leadership of the Labour Party. Martin stated that the purpose of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions was for the House to question the Prime Minister on the actions of the government. This caused such dissent amongst MPs that Martin threatened to suspend the session. Cameron re-worded the question to ask about Blair&#x27;s future as prime minister rather than leader of the Labour Party, which Martin allowed. Conservative MPs threatened to walk out if a similar event occurred in the future.

===Personal expenses===
In 2007, Martin used public money to employ lawyers in challenging negative press stories; media law firm Carter-Ruck was engaged for three months at a cost of more than £20,000. The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker criticised the use of taxpayers&#x27; money as a &quot;very expensive&quot; way to issue press releases; the TaxPayers&#x27; Alliance also expressed disapproval. Martin was also criticised at the same time for trying to block the publication of details of MPs&#x27; £5 million-a-year travel expenses under the Freedom of Information Act.

On 24 February 2008, John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, was asked by the Taxpayers&#x27; Alliance to investigate whether Martin had abused parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lyon was obliged to examine all such complaints although the Commissioner could have ruled that the complaint was unfounded. This followed a week in which Martin&#x27;s spokesman, the veteran Whitehall communications chief Mike Granatt of PR agency Luther Pendragon, resigned after admitting that he had unwittingly misled &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; over more than £4,000 in taxi expenses incurred by the Speaker&#x27;s wife, Mary Martin. Granatt blamed unnamed officials, but not the Speaker, for falsely informing him that the expenses were legitimate because Martin&#x27;s wife had been accompanied by an official on shopping trips to buy food for receptions. In fact, her housekeeper had accompanied her; catering for such receptions is the responsibility of the parliamentary caterers.

On 29 March 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed that refurbishment of Michael Martin&#x27;s official residence, Speaker&#x27;s House, had amounted to £1.7 million over seven years. The house is inside the Palace of Westminster. On 14 May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Martin had claimed £1,400 for using chauffeur-driven cars that included visits to Celtic Park, home of Celtic Football Club, and his local Job Centre.

===Damian Green affair===
In November 2008, Conservative immigration spokesman Damian Green was arrested, in connection with a police investigation into alleged leaks from the Home Office. The MP was detained for nine hours, and his homes and office in the House of Commons office were searched. Green was never charged with any crime. The raid on Commons premises angered many MPs, who viewed it as infringement on the democratic prerogatives of parliament.

Martin&#x27;s spokesperson was asked if he had approved the Metropolitan Police searching Green&#x27;s Commons office without a search warrant, and replied: &quot;There is a process to be followed and that was followed.&quot; When Parliament reconvened a few days later, Martin read a statement to MPs, stating that &quot;I have been told that the police did not explain, as they are required to do, that (House serjeant at arms Jill Pay) was not obliged to consent or that a warrant could have been insisted on.&quot; Martin also said that Pay had given consent for the search without consulting the clerk of the house. The Metropolitan Police questioned Martin&#x27;s account of events, writing in a letter to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that police &quot;explained the nature of the investigation and the purpose of the search&quot; to Pay &quot;and were satisfied that the serjeant at arms understood that police had no power to search in the absence of a warrant and therefore could only do so with her written consent or that of the Speaker.&quot;

Martin later testified that Pay had informed him of the police plans to raid a Commons office and arrest an MP, but was told that the arrest was related to terrorism. In a subsequent statement to a Commons committee investigating the incident, Martin said Pay failed to tell him that the search was being conducted on the basis of a consent form she had signed, rather than on the basis of a search warrant. Martin criticised Pay&#x27;s actions and those of the Commons clerk, Malcolm Jack, related to the affair. A report on the investigation, published in 2010, criticized Martin, writing that as speaker he &quot;failed to exercise the ultimate responsibility, which was his alone, to take control and not merely expect to be informed&quot; and that he &quot;should have been asking the right questions and ... should have taken more responsibility for exercising the authority of his high office.&quot; The report also criticized &quot;failings&quot; by multiple parties, including other Commons officials, civil servants, and the police, determining that they had made a &quot;quite unnecessary&quot; and &quot;poorly executed&quot; arrest of Green.

===Declaration of British Council expenses===
In 2009, Martin was involved in a row over expenses incurred by MPs on taxpayer-funded British Council trips. In 2008 Conservative MP Mark Lancaster flew business class to Bangkok with the British Council for a two-day conference, at a cost of £5,018. Labour MP Sally Keeble flew out economy class and returned business class at a cost of £2,452. MPs must normally declare any hospitality they receive from outside organisations, and the British Council does not appear on a list of bodies whose gifts are exempt from the requirement. Martin signed a special certificate preventing the release of information about these trips, citing &quot;Parliamentary privilege&quot;. This occurred during extensive revelations about MPs expenses.

===Resignation===
On 12 May 2009, the BBC reported that Michael Martin was under pressure to resign. On 17 May, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said that Michael Martin should stand down, saying he had become an obstacle to much-needed reform of Parliament. On 19 May, Douglas Carswell tabled a motion of no confidence, which 22 MPs signed. Later that day, Martin announced his intention to resign effective as of 21 June 2009. If the motion had been successful in a vote, Martin would have been the first Speaker to be forced out of office by a motion of no confidence since John Trevor in 1695. Martin said of his decision to resign:

He was made the Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead to be able to stand down as an MP on the same date, forcing a by-election in his constituency of Glasgow North East. An election for Speaker was held on 22 June, which was won by John Bercow.

Speakers are normally elevated to the House of Lords when they retire, and the government said it considered this a &quot;formality&quot;. A vetting panel for the House of Lords pointed out to Prime Minister Gordon Brown that nominees had to &quot;enhance rather than diminish&quot; the standing of the house, which some Labour MPs interpreted as a slur against Martin. Sixteen MPs signed a Commons motion requesting that the peer responsible, Lord Jay, withdraw his comment. In accordance with tradition, as soon as Martin&#x27;s successor as Speaker was installed, the first motion passed by the House of Commons was a resolution directing that a humble address be presented to The Queen, asking her &quot;to confer some signal mark of Her Royal favour&quot; (i.e., a peerage) upon Martin &quot;for his eminent services during the important period in which he presided with such distinguished ability and dignity in the Chair of this House&quot;.

==Life peerage and death==
Martin was made a life peer on 25 August 2009 as Baron Martin of Springburn, &quot;of Port Dundas in the City of Glasgow&quot;. He was introduced in the House of Lords on 13 October 2009. Like previous Speakers elevated to the Lords, he sat as a Crossbench peer.

Martin took a leave of absence from the House of Lords on 13 September 2017. Following a short illness, he died on 29 April 2018. Tributes were paid by current and former politicians, including then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Martin&#x27;s successor John Bercow, and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

==Arms==
==Family and personal life==
Martin met Mary McLay at the Heatovent factory, where she worked as an assembly worker, and they got married in 1966. The couple had a son and a daughter. His son Paul Martin was the Labour Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow Springburn from 1999 to 2011, then for the Glasgow Provan constituency from 2011 until his defeat at the 2016 Scottish election.

Martin was a keen player of the bagpipes, having regularly played for guests during his annually hosted Burns night supper. In the run-up to a St Andrew&#x27;s Day reception on the parliamentary estate, Martin is reported to have once made a special intervention on behalf of the SNP group in the run-up to a Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day reception, overruling the decision of the Serjeant at Arms to allow bagpipes to be played on the parliamentary estate.

<text>In the ancient Roman legend of the regal period, the Horatii were three sibling warriors, sons of Publius Horatius, who lived during the reign of Tullus Hostilius. The accounts of their epic clash with the Curiatii appear in the writings of Livy. The story includes Publius Horatius, the sole survivor of the battle, murdering his sister for mourning the death of a beloved Curiatius.

==War with Alba Longa==

Livy recounts this tale in the first book of his &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot;. During the Roman king Tullus Hostilius&#x27; war with the neighboring city of Alba Longa, it was agreed that fighting a costly war between their armies would leave the door open for an Etruscan invasion. Sabine dictator Mettius Fufetius appealed to Tullus Hostilius that the conflict should be settled by a fight to the death between the Roman Horatii triplets and their Alban counterparts, known as the Curiatii. They met on the battlefield between the lines as the two armies and their countrymen looked on.

With so much at stake, both sides fought bravely. The Horatii had wounded all three Curiatii, but two of the Romans were killed in the process. That left their brother Publius alone and surrounded by the three Albans. Though he was uninjured, Publius realized he stood no chance against all three of his enemies together. So he began to run across the battlefield instead. The Albans pursued him, each as fast as their individual injuries permitted. This was exactly what he had hoped they would do, and after they had gone far enough, he saw that the Curiatii had become staggered and were separated from each another. His plan had worked perfectly. He turned and launched a furious attack on the first, least-injured Curiatius and slew him.

The Roman spectators, who, moments before, had been sure of defeat, began cheering wildly as the Albans began shouting at the Curiatii to regroup in the face of Publius&#x27; onslaught. But before they could, the Horatius caught up to the second Curiatius and killed him as his brother, helpless, looked on. The final Curiatius was physically spent from his wounds and the chase. His hope had been crushed by watching both of his brothers die. He managed to unsteadily stand his ground and faced the Horatius, who was heartened by his wildly successful strategy and confident of his imminent victory. Publius declared that he had killed the first two Curiatii for his fallen brothers. He would kill this last one for the Roman cause and their rule over the Albans. He thrust his sword down the Alban&#x27;s throat and took the armor of his slain enemies as the spoils of his victory.

Afterwards, the Alban dictator Mettius honored the treaty and Alba Longa briefly accepted Roman rule, before provoking a war with the Fidenates and betraying Rome.

==Homecoming of Publius==

The victorious Horatius returned to a hero&#x27;s welcome. Before the war had broken out, Publius&#x27; sister, Camilla, had been engaged to one of the Alban triplets. When she saw the cloak that she herself had woven and given to the Curiatius on her brother&#x27;s shoulder, now stained with his blood, she realized that her betrothed had been slain. Camilla was overcome with grief and began wailing and crying out his name. Proclaiming that no Roman woman should mourn Rome&#x27;s fallen enemies, Publius killed his sister on the spot.

For his crime, he was condemned to death. On the advice of a jurist named Tullus Hostilius (also the king at the time), Publius appealed to one of the popular assemblies. In defense of his son, the Horatius&#x27; father, also Publius, spoke of the recent victory and entreated them to spare his last surviving son (his fourth son, a brother of the Horatii, had also died). The assembly was persuaded and Publius&#x27; sentence was commuted. This may be the source of the Roman tradition of allowing the condemned to appeal their sentences to the populace. 

Publius the elder was required to offer a sacrifice to atone for his son&#x27;s crime and from that time forward, the Horatia family made it a tradition to offer the same. The spoils of the victory were hung in a place that became known as Pila Horatia. A wooden beam was erected on the slope of the Oppian Hill, which was called the Sororium Tigillum (Sister&#x27;s Beam). It symbolized a yoke, under which Publius the younger was made to pass. It remained standing long after his death.
