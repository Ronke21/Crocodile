<text>A number of legal systems make provision for companies trading while insolvent to be unlawful in certain circumstances, and provide for directors to become personally liable for a company&#x27;s debts if they have acted improperly. In most legal systems, the liability in respect of unlawful transactions only extends for a certain period of time prior to the company going into liquidation.

==UK law==
Under UK insolvency law, trading once a company is legally insolvent can trigger several provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986, including:

*Wrongful trading – Section 214
*Transaction at an undervalue – Section 238
*Preferences – Section 239
*Extortionate credit transactions – Section 244

A limited company becomes insolvent when it can no longer pay its bills when due, or its liabilities—including contingent liabilities such as redundancy payments—outweigh the company’s assets. This is a critical point in the lifespan of a company as it denotes when the directors&#x27; responsibilities move from the interests of shareholders to the interests of creditors. It also means that the directors need to be extremely careful when considering whether to continue to trade, or not. Any director who knows that the company is insolvent and makes the decision to continue to trade, and in doing so increases the debts of the company can be made liable for the company debts.

In the UK, directors are exposed in respect of transaction at an undervalue, preferences, and extortionate credit transactions if the transaction occurred: a) while the company was insolvent; and b) within 2 years before the onset of liquidation if the transaction was with a connected person, and 6 months if the transaction was with an unconnected person.

Directors who continue to trade while insolvent may face disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Under the provision of this act, when a company goes into liquidation, the liquidator must make a report to the Disqualification Unit of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on the conduct of all directors. If the liquidator has come across any conduct which makes the director unfit to be involved in the management of a company in the future (which things would include trading while insolvent) the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will apply to the Court for an order disqualifying the director or directors from acting as a company director for a certain period of time.

==Other countries==
Many other countries have similar laws, often referred to as &#x27;insolvent trading&#x27; or wrongful trading.

<doc id="750414" wikidata="Q5646388" url="?curid=750414" title="Hams Hall">
<text>Hams Hall is a place near Lea Marston in North Warwickshire, England, named after the former Hams Hall manor house. A power station at Hams Hall was constructed and operated in the late 1920s; a further two power stations began generating electricity in the 1940s and 1950s. By 1993 all three power stations had been closed and demolished and an industrial park Hams Hall Distribution Park was built. An intermodal rail terminal Hams Hall Rail Freight Terminal also operates at the site.

==Hams Hall Estate==
The Hams Hall Estate and what is modern day Saltley was owned by the Adderley family for over 262 years. The name of the estate was derived from the fact that the land lay in a great hook (ham) of the River Tame.

As Birmingham and the Black Country developed, the estate faced two problems: loss of land to the west, and lack of water from the river due to industrial pollution. Thus, after Robert Rawlinson&#x27;s report on the condition of Birmingham in 1848 suggesting the need for a public park, Charles Adderley, 1st Baron Norton donated of land to create Adderley Park, which he managed privately from 1855 to 1864. He also donated land for the construction of St Saviour&#x27;s Church, St Peter&#x27;s College, Saltley and the reformatory on the Fordrough, later called Norton Boys&#x27; Home. In 1879 Lord Norton sold Whitacre Lodge to the city for the construction of the Shustoke Reservoir, the largest single source of water for Birmingham until the Elan/Claerwen scheme was completed.

Following the death of Charles Adderley in 1905, the residual estate was put up for sale in 1911 to pay death duties. Initially purchased by an American shipping magnate, he dismantled the house in 1921. It was reassembled as Bledisloe Lodge, a hall of residence for students at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester at Coates, Gloucestershire. 

==Hams Hall Power Station==

The City of Birmingham bought land at Hams Hall, and built an electricity generating station (Hams Hall A), from 1928. Located north of Coleshill Parkway railway station, the location allowed easy access for coal supply trains from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway mainline. Built under the direction of Richard Alexander Chattock (1865–1936), Birmingham City Electrical Engineer.

Two more stations (Hams Hall B and C) were later built on the site, reputedly the largest in Europe at the time of their construction. The city&#x27;s electricity generating and supply functions were nationalised in the late 1940s.

The Central Electricity Generating Board took over responsibility for the site from Birmingham and founded an environmental studies centre, re-erecting Lea Ford Cottage (a local medieval timber-framed building) there to preserve it. Still owned by site owner E.ON, it is now known as &quot;Hams Hall Environmental Studies Centre&quot;. The area alongside the confluence of the River Blythe and River Tame became the West Midland Bird Club&#x27;s Ladywalk Reserve.

All three stations were closed and demolished in the 1990s. The land was cleared, on which was built &quot;Hams Hall Distribution Park&quot;, with only electrical sub-stations remaining.

==Hams Hall Distribution Park==
After the Hams Hall Power station site was cleared, Powergen accepted various European and Central Government grants to allow a consortium of construction companies including Alfred McAlpine to construct a new industrial estate called Hams Hall Distribution Park,

The site includes road (M42) and rail access (through the &quot;Hams Hall Rail Freight Terminal&quot;).

In 2011 the site housed clients including E.ON, Sainsbury&#x27;s, BMW (engine manufacturing plant), DHL, ABB Group, Chubb, BEKO, EXEL and Wincanton.

===Hams Hall Rail Freight Terminal===

The &quot;Hams Hall Channel Tunnel Freight Terminal&quot; was opened 11 July 1997 by the then deputy prime minister John Prescott. As of 2010 the site was one of the main international intermodal terminals in the UK.

The site was originally operated by Parsec Europe Ltd.; in 2002 Associated British Ports acquired the site lease.

The terminal is sited on the southern edge of Hams Hall business park; since 2004 it has had customs clearance to handle international traffic via the Channel Tunnel; the site has storage for 6,000 TEU, and rail access is cleared to W10 vehicle gauge. There are also regular daily flows from Felixstowe. The area around Nuneaton and the Midlands has been referred to as the &quot;Golden Triangle of Logistics&quot;. Hams Hall Rail Freight Terminal is in this Golden Triangle and one of the busiest intermodal terminals.

<text>Arthur Wynne (; June 22, 1871January 14, 1945) was the British-born inventor of the modern crossword puzzle.

==Early life==
Arthur Wynne was born on June 22, 1871, in Liverpool, England, and lived on Edge Lane for a time. His father was the editor of the local newspaper, the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot;. He emigrated to the United States on June 6, 1891, at the age of 19, settling for a time in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

==Career==
While in Pittsburgh, Wynne worked on the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; newspaper and played the violin in the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. He later moved to New York City and worked on the &quot;New York World&quot; newspaper. He is best known for the invention of the crossword puzzle in 1913, when he was a resident of Cedar Grove, New Jersey.

Wynne created the page of puzzles for the &quot;Fun&quot; section of the Sunday edition of the &quot;New York World&quot;. For the December 21, 1913, edition, he introduced a puzzle with a diamond shape and a hollow center, with the letters F-U-N already being filled in. He called it a &quot;Word-Cross Puzzle.&quot;

Although Wynne&#x27;s invention was based on earlier puzzle forms, such as the word diamond, he introduced a number of innovations (e.g. the use of horizontal and vertical lines to create boxes for solvers to enter letters). He subsequently pioneered the use of black squares in a symmetrical arrangement to separate words in rows and columns. With the exception of the numbering scheme, the form of Wynne&#x27;s &quot;Word-Cross&quot; puzzles is that used for modern crosswords.

A few weeks after the first &quot;Word-Cross&quot; appeared, the name of the puzzle was changed to &quot;Cross-Word&quot; as a result of a typesetting error. Wynne&#x27;s puzzles have been known as &quot;crosswords&quot; ever since.

==Later life and death==

Arthur Wynne became a naturalized US citizen in the 1920s. He died in Clearwater, Florida, on January 14, 1945.

<text>The Uranians were a late-19th-century and early-20th-century clandestine group of up to several dozen male homosexual poets and prose writers who principally wrote on the subject of the love of (or by) adolescent boys. In a strict definition they were an English literary and cultural movement; in a broader definition there were also American Uranians. The movement reached its peak between the late 1880s and mid 1890s, but has been regarded as stretching between 1858, when William Johnson Cory&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Ionica&quot; appeared, and 1930, the year of publication of Samuel Elsworth Cottam&#x27;s &quot;Cameos of Boyhood and Other Poems&quot; and of E. E. Bradford&#x27;s last collection, &quot;Boyhood&quot;.

==Etymology==

English advocates of homosexual emancipation such as Edward Carpenter and John Addington Symonds took to using the term &quot;Uranian&quot; to describe a comradely love that would bring about true democracy. The word was coined on the basis of classical sources, being inspired principally by the epithet Aphrodite Urania as discussed in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;. Plato distinguishes two forms of the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite, &quot;the elder, having no mother, who is called the heavenly Aphrodite [Urania] — she is the daughter of Uranus; the younger, who is the daughter of Zeus and Dione — her we call &#x27;common&#x27; .&quot; Aphrodite Urania represents a more &quot;celestial&quot; love of body and soul, whereas Aphrodite Pandemos represents a more physical lust.

The term Uranian came to be much used in the circle of Uranian writers for its novelty and euphoniousness, its literal meaning &quot;heavenly&quot; giving it a cachet of the noble and sublime. While the same classical sources supplied the German coinage &quot;Urning&quot; for male homosexuals, as used by the German theorist and campaigner Karl Heinrich Ulrichs in the 1860s, this German derivation ran parallel to the English derivation &quot;Uranian&quot; rather than being its source.

==Movement==
The Uranian writers formed a rather cohesive group with a well-expressed philosophy. Their work is characterized by an idealised appeal to the history of Ancient Greece, as well as by a use of conservative verse forms. Many Uranian writers borrowed classical Greek themes such as paganism, democracy and male camaraderie or intimacy, applying these concepts to their own time. Besides Greek themes, they made use of Oriental, Christian and other motifs.

The chief poets of the circle were William Johnson Cory, Lord Alfred Douglas, Montague Summers, John Francis Bloxam, Charles Kains Jackson, John Gambril Nicholson, E. E. Bradford, John Addington Symonds, Edmund John, John Moray Stuart-Young, Charles Edward Sayle, Fabian S. Woodley, and several pseudonymous authors such as Philebus (John Leslie Barford), A. Newman (Francis Edwin Murray) and Arthur Lyon Raile (Edward Perry Warren, who wrote &quot;A Defence of Uranian Love&quot;). The flamboyantly eccentric novelist Frederick Rolfe (also known as &quot;Baron Corvo&quot;) was a unifying presence in their social network, both within and without Venice.

Historian Neil McKenna has argued that Uranian poetry had a central role in the upper-class homosexual subcultures of the Victorian period. He insisted that poetry was the main medium through which writers such as Oscar Wilde, Rennell Rodd, 1st Baron Rennell and George Cecil Ives sought to challenge anti-homosexual ideas. The Uranians met each other and stayed in touch through such organisations as the Order of Chaeronea, which was founded by Ives and began holding occasional meetings in London about 1897.

Marginally associated with their world were more famous writers such as Edward Carpenter, as well as the obscure but prophetic poet-printer Ralph Chubb. His majestic volumes of lithographs celebrated the adolescent boy as an Ideal. A case has been made to range the Americans George Edward Woodberry and Cuthbert Wright among the Uranian poets. Although not expatriates, they were well-versed in the Uranian material being written in England, sought to influence an English Uranian audience and struck a rather English pose in their poetry.

The Uranians&#x27; activity was the first stage in the effort to rehabilitate the ancient Greek notion of &quot;paiderasteia&quot;, a quest that was not successful. The age of consent today in Great Britain is legally set at 16, regardless of gender, in most circumstances.

==Publications on Uranian poets and poetry==
There are two book-length studies of the Uranians: &quot;Love In Earnest&quot; by Timothy d&#x27;Arch Smith (1970) and &quot;Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde&quot; by Michael Matthew Kaylor (2006; available as an open-access E-text). Kaylor expands the Uranian canon by situating several major Victorians within the group. Other critics, such as Richard Dellamora (&quot;Masculine Desire: The Sexual Politics of Victorian Aestheticism&quot;, 1990) and Linda Dowling (&quot;Hellenism and Homosexuality in Victorian Oxford&quot;, 1994) have also contributed to the limited knowledge about this group. Paul Fussell discusses Uranian poetry in his book &quot;The Great War and Modern Memory&quot; (1975), suggesting that it provided a model for homoerotic representations in the war poets of World War I (e.g. Wilfred Owen).

Poems by the Uranians – as well as by their American counterparts, sometimes called the &quot;Calamites&quot; after the &quot;Calamus&quot; section in Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; – were included in &quot;Men and Boys: An Anthology&quot; (1924), edited by Edward Mark Slocum, which was republished with a new introduction in 1978. More recent anthologies and republications of Uranian poetry are Kaylor&#x27;s exhaustive two-volume &quot;Lad&#x27;s Love: An anthology of Uranian poetry and prose&quot; (2010a and 2010b) and a three-volume series by the Gay Men&#x27;s Press, each volume introduced by Paul I. Webb: &quot;To Boys Unknown: Poems by Rev. E. E. Bradford&quot; (1988), &quot;In the Dreamy Afternoon: Poems by John Gambril Nicholson&quot; (1989) and &quot;Blue Boys: Poems by Philebus, Edmund John, Cuthbert Wright&quot; (1990).

<text>Robert John Wynne (November 18, 1851 – March 11, 1922) was an American who served as United States Postmaster General from 1904 to 1905, and as Consul General at the American embassy in the United Kingdom from 1905 to 1910. He was also a distinguished and popular journalist for a number of newspapers and magazines in the late 1800s.

==Early life==
Wynne was born in New York City in 1851. His father was a veteran of the Mexican–American War. He was educated in the city&#x27;s public schools, but also had a number of private tutors. He was just 10 years old when the American Civil War broke out. He wanted to enlist, but was too young. His father served in the Civil War, however, and young Robert accompanied him to the front and saw several battles.

In 1870, Wynne became a telegraph operator for the &quot;Cincinnati Gazette&quot;, living part-time in Washington, D.C. He was hired at the request of General Henry V. Boynton, who led the paper&#x27;s staff in D.C. and who wanted the very best telegraph operator he could find. That was Wynne. Wynne also lived part-time in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he worked for the American Press Association. He also worked for the Pacific and Atlantic Telegraph Company, and became its chief telegrapher.

Boynton was so impressed with Wynne&#x27;s work as a reporter that he encouraged him to abandon telegraphy and become a journalist full-time. In 1880, Wynne joined the &quot;Gazette&quot; as a full-time journalist. Boynton syndicated Wynne&#x27;s work to a wide range of newspapers, including the &quot;St. Louis Democrat&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Pittsburgh Commercial&quot;, and &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;.

==Public service==
In February 1893, Wynne became the private secretary to Secretary of the Treasury Charles Foster. After a change in presidential administrations in March 1893, he continued in the role for Secretary of the Treasury John G. Carlisle, but left public service in August 1893. He returned to journalism, this time working for the &quot;New York Press&quot; and the &quot;Cincinnati Tribune&quot;.

In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Wynne to be First Assistant Postmaster General. He was not Roosevelt&#x27;s first choice: That had been Indianapolis, Indiana, journalist Harry C. New, but New turned down the post. Wynne, too, was reluctant to take it, but Roosevelt pressured him and he accepted. In this role, Wynne uncovered extensive fraud in the department. He first became suspicious of illegal activity as a reporter, and his investigation as First Assistant Postmaster General led to many departmental resignations and prison time for a few people. The incumbent Postmaster General, Henry Clay Payne, died on October 4, 1904. Wynne was appointed Acting Postmaster General the next day, and named Postmaster General on October 10. He served until March 5, 1905.

Wynne was appointed Consul General at the Embassy of the United States in London on January 11, 1905, while still serving as Postmaster General. Incoming President William Howard Taft reaffirmed his posting, and he went to London on April 1, 1905. He resigned in May 1909. He remained in London for the next 19 months, representing various American businesses. In January 1910, Wynne was caught in the Stoats Nest railway disaster, in which eight people died.

==Business career==

Returning to private life, Wynne was appointed president of the First National Fire Insurance Company when it formed in February 1912 through the merger of the Continental and Munsey insurance companies. In October 1912, First National Fire purchased a half-interest in the Southern Building at 15th and H Streets NW. Trust deeds of $800,000, $450,000, and $325,000 attached to the building. First National Fire was sued by its stockholders for incurring this debt. In January 1912, the company was the focus of a congressional investigation into fraud committed by insurance companies.

Wynne was ousted as president in April 1914 over the Southern Building acquisition. Suspicious that proxy votes had been withheld from the count, Wynne successfully sued to have personal mail which had been delivered to the company (and which the company had seized) returned to him. As he expected, many proxy votes had not been counted. When they were counted, Wynne was reelected president of the company on June 17, 1914.

The Commercial Fire Insurance Company of Baltimore, Maryland, the co-owner of the Southern Building, tried to force a merger with First National in August 1914. Wynne resisted the merger, and demanded that the Southern Building be partitioned so that First National could extricate itself from its business arrangements with Commercial Fire. The partition effort was unsuccessful, and in December 1914 Commercial Fire sold its interest in the structure. Commercial Fire went bankrupt days later.

On February 10, 1915, businessman William Tryson and others formed the Allan E. Walker Company to buy the Southern Building. Nine days later, First National Fire sold the building to the Walker Company for an undisclosed amount. This allowed the $450,000 and $325,000 trusts to be paid and released. On March 18, the Walker Company sold the building back to First National, incurring a trust deed of $600,000. This triggered more stockholder lawsuits, which argued that Wynne was attempting to hide the company&#x27;s financial distress.

Although the stockholder suits were not successful, the reputation of First National Fire Insurance was severely damaged. On February 7, 1917, First National&#x27;s stockholders approved the refinancing of the Southern Building. The structure was sold again to the Walker Company on February 14, and the Walker Company sold it back to First National on February 28 (now subject to a single trust deed of $900,000). On March 7, First National&#x27;s board of directors agreed to form a new company—the Southern Realty Corporation, with Wynne as its president—to buy the Southern Building. On March 10, First National&#x27;s shareholders were advised to trade their stock on a one-to-one basis for stock in the Southern Building, with any excess proceeds from the sale returning to First National stockholders as a dividend. On May 18, the Walker Company offered to buy the building for $1.8 million (to be paid with a first mortgage of $900,000, a second mortgage of $677,000, and the remainder by First National stockholders who wanted shares in the Walker Company). First National agreed to the Walker Co. sale, leading to a struggle for control of the Southern Building among the three entities.

First National filed for voluntary bankruptcy on August 13, 1917. Wynne continued as president of the Southern Realty Corporation, which remained solvent. The bankruptcy led to extensive litigation, as shareholders who did not invest in the Walker Company sued to recover their investment in First National and the Walker Company fought to gain ownership of the Southern Building from the Southern Realty Corporation. During this litigation, First National&#x27;s title to the building was reaffirmed, First National&#x27;s deal to sell the building to the Walker Company was annulled, the sale of the building by First National to Southern Realty affirmed, and tenants sued over skyrocketing rents at the building. Southern Realty&#x27;s investors unsuccessfully sued in July 1920 to have Southern Realty declared bankrupt. Additional court hearings in late July 1920 led to the sale of the Southern Building to the Walker Company in late August 1920. With the Walker Company assuming full control by October, Southern Realty was liquidated in July 1921.

Wynne had long defended First National&#x27;s financial health. The company&#x27;s liquidation largely proved him correct: Few of the stockholders in First National lost money.

Wynne was also an incorporator, vice president, and director of the Washington and Southern Bank. He helped form the bank in April 1912, and remained with it until August 1913.

==Personal life==
Wynne married Mary Ellen McCabe, daughter of a wealthy construction contractor. She died in October 1915 of a heart attack.

Wynne began suffering frail health from cardiac disease in 1919. Wynne died at his home at 1511 Park Road NW in Washington, D.C., from cardiac disease on March 11, 1922. A Catholic, he was interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

Wynne had several children: Charles J. Wynne (later a captain in the United States Army), Alice Wynne Semler, John S. Wynne, Ruth Austin Wynne Smith, Ida Marcella Wynne French, Robert Frank Wynne (a captain in the United States Marine Corps), and Henry B. Wynne. His sons Robert and Henry preceded him in death. Robert saw action in Cuba, the Philippines, and China (during the Boxer Rebellion), and died in March 1912 of tuberculosis contracted while in China.

==Memberships==
Wynne was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (the &quot;Loyal Legion&quot;). He was also a member of the Gridiron Club, which he helped organize (and of which he was later president); the Army and Navy Club; the National Press Club, and the Columbia Country Club.

In February 1919, Wynne was named to the committee seeking to build a national memorial to Theodore Roosevelt.

<text>Fire performance is a group of performance arts or skills that involve the manipulation of fire. Fire performance typically involves equipment or other objects made with one or more wicks which are designed to sustain a large enough flame to create a visual effect.

Fire performance includes skills based on juggling, baton twirling, poi spinning, and other forms of object manipulation. It also includes skills such as fire breathing, fire eating, and body burning; sometimes called fakir skills. Fire performance has various styles of performance including fire dancing; the use of fire as a finale in an otherwise non-fire performance; and the use of fire skills as &#x27;dangerous&#x27; stunts. Performances can be done as choreographed routines to music (this type being related to dance or rhythmic gymnastics); as freestyle (performed to music or not) performances; or performed with vocal interaction with the audience. Some aspect of fire performance can be found in a wide variety of cultural traditions and rituals from around the world.

Any performance involving fire carries inherent danger and risks, and fire safety precautions should always be taken.
==History==
One of the earliest mentions of fire performance was at the ceremony of Simchat Beit HaShoeivah during the holidays of sukkot of the Second Temple by the Jews in Jerusalem Circa 10AD - 70AD. 
It has been said about Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel 
that when he was rejoicing with the joy of the Water-Drawing he would take eight burning torches in one hand and toss them upwards; he tossed one and caught one, and never did one touch the other.
Ancient Aztecs performed a fire dance dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli, the god of fire. The Aztec fire dance is performed today for tourists in Mexico. In Bali, the Angel Dance and the Fire Dance, regularly performed for tourists, have origins in ancient rituals. Both the Angel Dance and the Fire Dance originated in a trance ritual called the &quot;sanghyang&quot;, a ritual dance &quot;performed to ward off witches at the time of an epidemic.&quot; Also known as the &quot;horse dance&quot; men perform the dance by holding rods representing horses, while leaping around burning coconut husks, and walking through the flames. Jamaica, French Polynesia, Antigua, Cuba and Saint Lucia are other locations where fire dances are recreated for (and by) tourists. The Siddha Jats of the Thar Desert in India perform traditional fire dances as part of the Spring festival. Fire dancing is performed to music played on drums and the behr. There are variations of the fire dancing; men often perform a dance that involves walking on hot coals and things. A large fire is created and allowed to burn down until it is a pit of glowing embers and things. The performers then jump in and out of the pit kicking up the embers and things to create showers of sparks while women perform a dance while balancing flaming tin pots on their heads. Today this ritual is often performed for (and by) tourists.

Another form of fire dancing comes from the people of Polynesia. It is believed that the Māori people of New Zealand would soak a ball attached to string in fuel, light it and perform dancing rituals. &quot;Poi&quot; is a Māori word meaning &quot;ball on a string&quot; making the Maori people the originators of the flow equipment still popular today. See Poi (performance art).
==Modern developments==
Since the mid-1990s, fire performance has grown in popularity. This growth has occurred both for hobby and professional practitioners. Fire skills are performed at raves, nightclubs, beach parties, and music festivals. One such festival that is especially popular with fire performers is Burning Man. Fire performance has become increasingly popular as entertainment at corporate events, street festivals, celebration events and as a precursor to firework displays.

==Types==

Fire performance has become more popular through the availability of a wider variety of fire equipment and teaching methods.

* Traditional fire shows: Traditional shows often incorporate Polynesian costuming and other cultural elements. Many conform to the guidelines or are inspired by the annual World Fireknife Competition and Samoa Festival. 
* Modern fire shows: These shows vary greatly from performances choreographed to music to street style shows with varying levels of audience interaction and participation. Modern fire shows can use a very wide range of fire skills and props.
* Fire theatre: Such shows are theatrical shows which include fire and fire performance as elements of staged dramatic presentations. Often the fire performance is a small element of the larger show. These shows tend to use more elaborate props and costuming and can focus less on technical skill.
* Fire fetish show: Such shows are recognizable by more overt sexuality in the performance and often extremely risqué costuming, nudity, and implied or actual sexual contact between performers, and are often seen as a fusion between exotic dancing or burlesque with fire dancing. Thus, fire fetish refers to a particular style of performance, and not a sexual fetish on the part of the performer, as would pyrophilia.
* Erotic fire show: Such shows may be seen as simply a normal improvised fire dance but with emphasis on sexually arousing body gyrations, seductive facial expressions, an eroticised musical selection (such as R&amp;B or downtempo music), and the performer wearing minimal or no clothing, thus promoting sexual arousal or desire in addition to the expected visual entertainment for an audience. Unlike a fire fetish show, this performance is generally more low-key, slower in tempo, and may be performed by a solo dancer in front of a small and select audience, often a spouse or romantic partner. This performance can be an active and visually exciting form of ritual foreplay, enticing to some audiences. In some cases this is a routine part of a strip club&#x27;s offerings.
* Ritual fire show: Such shows are usually a fusion of pagan or occult ceremony with fire and fire performance. They focus less on technical skill, and more on the use of the fire dancer to highlight the ritual or represent the specific element of fire.
* Fire and belly dance: Such shows are a fusion of Middle Eastern belly dancing (&quot;raqs sharqi&quot;) and combine elements of fire dancing and belly dancing. Often the dancers use palm torches and fire swords made to resemble scimitars.
* Fire jugglers may combine juggling, fire and comedy into a live performance. This may include lighting parts of their body on fire.
*Flow artists (see Object manipulation) who specialise in fire props may utilise equipment such as Fire staff, Hula hoop and Devil sticks.

==Fire apparatus==
Fire performance is usually performed with props that have specifically been made for the purpose. Fire torches, fire staffs, fire poi, fire hula hoops, fire whips, and other fire props are all readily available.
*Poi – A pair of roughly arm-length chains with handles attached to one end, and bundle of wicking material on the other.
*Staff – A metal or wooden tube ranging from 1–2 m long with wicking material applied to one or both ends. Staffs are typically used individually or in pairs. juggling three or more is also possible.
*Dragonstaff – A metal or wooden tube around 2 m long where each end consists of three or more wicks arranged in a wheel. Dragon staves are more often rolled on the body rather than spun.
*Fire hoop – hoop with spokes and wicking material attached.
*Fan – A large metal fan with one or more wicks attached to the edges.
*Fire umbrella – an umbrella-like performance prop that can be constructed in a variety of ways.
*Fire meteor – A long length of chain or rope with wicks, or small bowls of liquid fuel, attached to both ends.
*Nunchaku – Nunchaku with wicking material, usually at either end.
*Fire stick – Like a traditional devil stick, with wicks on both ends of the central stick.
*Torch – A club or baton, with a wick on one end, and swung like Indian clubs or tossed end-over-end like juggling clubs.
*Fire knife – Short stave with blade attached to the end and wicking material applied to the blade. Fire knives are the traditional Polynesian fire implement and have been in use since the 1940s.
*Fire rope dart – A wick, sometimes wrapped around a steel spike, at the end of a rope or chain ranging from 6–15 feet long, with a ring or other handle on the opposite end.
*Fire wand – a short metal rod, usually 28 inches long with two wicks on each end and a length of fire-resistant string threaded through the middle. The wand is balanced to stay upright and gives the appearance that it is levitating around the user. It is also known as a levitation wand, levi-stick or flow wand.
*Fire sword – either a real sword modified for fire, or one specifically built for the purpose of fire shows with a fibreglass centre wrapped in kevlar wick.
*Fire orb – 2 rings or handles with a wick attached between them by a thin wire. Also known as a fire bug or Chi ball.
*Fire fingers – Short and thin torches attached to individual fingers.
*Palm torches – Small torches with a flat base meant to be held upright in the palm of the hand.
*Fire hip belt – A motorcycle chain belt with five spokes extending at equal intervals with wicking on the ends.
*Fire whip – Lengths of braided aramid fiber tapered to make a bullwhip, usually with a metal handle about 12 inches long. The whip can be cracked to create large plumes of fire. 
*Fire flogger – A traditional BDSM flogger with kevlar or Technora tails. Can be used for both performance and temperature play
*Fire rope/snake – Similar to poi, but has a short 3–5 inch chain attaching the handles to a 12-inch or longer kevlar or Technora rope.
*Fire jump rope – A jump rope made of kevlar or Technora. 
*Fire cannon – a propane flame effect device; larger ones can shoot a pillar of fire up to 200+ feet in the air, although they usually are mounted to a base or vehicle.
*Fire poofer – Similar to fire cannons, but much smaller and made to be held, with fuel stored in a &quot;backpack&quot; fashioned of one or more propane tanks.
*Fire ball – Specially constructed juggling balls, either solid balls dipped in fuel and juggled with protective gloves, or ones designed to contain the flame in the centre of the ball.
*Wearable fire – Headdresses, hip belts, arm bands, or other garments made typically of metal with kevlar or Technora torches attached. Can be worn while fire dancing.

===Fuels===
Nearly all modern fire performance apparatus rely on a liquid fuel soaked in the wick. There are many choices for fuels, which differ in their specific properties. Fire performers select a fuel or a blend of fuels based on safety, cost, availability, and the desirability of various characteristics of the fuel including for example, the colour of flame, and flame temperature. There is also some geographic variance in fuels used, due local availability and price. Some American fire performers use white gas although most use other fuels due to its low flash point, while British fire performers use paraffin (called kerosene in the US) or the white gas substitute petroleum naphtha. 

=== Safety ===
Fire performance skills are inherently dangerous and only careful use of the props, storage of the fuel and performance in appropriate spaces will mean that the risks are minimised. Fire insurance policies all require fire performers to carry fire extinguishers, fire blankets or other fire safety equipment.

==Fire arts education==
There are organized events in various parts of the world teaching fire arts and object manipulation. These events which can be fire festivals or workshops at juggling or music festivals are popular in US, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia.

<text>Vijayawada ( ), also known by its colonial name Bezawada, is the second largest city and commercial hub in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The city is part of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region and is located on the banks of the Krishna River surrounded by the hills of the Eastern Ghats, known as the Indrakeeladri Hills. The city is home to the important Hindu shrine of Kanaka Durga Temple. It geographically lies on the center spot of Andhra Pradesh. The city has been described as the commercial, political, cultural and educational capital of Andhra Pradesh. It is the administrative headquarters of NTR district. The Prakasam Barrage across the Krishna River connects the NTR and Guntur districts.

It is one of the fastest growing urban areas in India and among the top 10 fastest growing cities in the world according to Oxford Economics report.

Vijayawada is considered to be a sacred place due to it being home to one of the most visited and famous temples in Andhra Pradesh and India, the Kanaka Durga Temple of the Hindu Goddess Durga residing on the Indrakeeladri hill. It also serves as the ritual host of Pushkaram (a river worshipping ritual in India) of the River Krishna. There is a legend which says that Arjuna, one of the heroes of the Indian epic Mahabharata, prayed on top of the Indrakeeladri Hill in the city and won the blessings of the Lord Shiva to get the Pashupatastra to win the Kurukshetra War. It was called Vijayavatika (meaning Land of Victory in Telugu) when Goddess Durga killed the demon Mahishasura and rested on the Indrakeeladri Hill by the River Krishna establishing the victory over evil hence the place got its name Vijayavatika, &quot;Vijaya&quot; meaning victory, and &quot;Vatika&quot; meaning place or land in Telugu.

The city is the third most densely populated urban built-up area in the world. and is classified as a &quot;Y-grade&quot; city by the Sixth Central Pay Commission. The city is the second most populous in the state with a population of more than one million. It was recognised as a &quot;Global City of the Future&quot; by &quot;McKinsey Quarterly&quot;, which expected an increase to GDP of $17 billion by 2025.

== Toponymy ==
There are many legends behind the origin of the name Vijayawada. It is said that Goddess Durga killed Mahishasura and relaxed at this place. As she was victorious, the place came to be known as Vijayawada (&quot;vijaya&quot; translates to victory and &quot;wada&quot; as place, literally meaning &quot;The Place of Victory&quot;). The hill was called as &quot;Indrekeeladri&quot; since it was frequently visited by Indra and his affiliates. The epic Mahabharata refers to the Indrakiladri hills as the place where Arjuna secured Pashupatastra from Lord Shiva. One of the names of Arjuna is &quot;Vijaya&quot; (invincible). Thus city thereafter came to be known as &quot;Vijayavatika&quot; (&#x27;Vatika&#x27; translates to place in Telugu) and later as Vijayawada.

A tale behind its acquiring the name Bezawada is that Goddess Krishnaveni (River Krishna) requested Arjuna to make a passage for her to merge into the Bay of Bengal.

<text>The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, also known as the DHR or the Toy Train, is a gauge railway that runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling in the Indian state of West Bengal. Built between 1879 and 1881, it is about long. It climbs from about above sea level at New Jalpaiguri to about at Darjeeling, using six zig zags and three loops (originally five) to gain altitude. Ghum station is situated at an altitude of . Six diesel locomotives handle most of the scheduled service, with daily tourist trains from Darjeeling to Ghum – India&#x27;s highest railway station – and the steam-hauled &quot;Red Panda&quot; service from Darjeeling to Kurseong. Steam-enthusiast specials are hauled by vintage British-built B-Class steam locomotives. The railway&#x27;s headquarters are at Kurseong.

On 5 December 1999, UNESCO declared the DHR a World Heritage Site. Two more railway lines were later added, and the site became known as one of the mountain railways of India.

==History==
Siliguri, at the base of the Himalayas, was connected with Calcutta (now Kolkata) by a metre gauge railway in 1878. Between Siliguri and Darjeeling, Tonga services ran on a cart road – the present-day Hill Cart Road. Franklin Prestage, an agent of the Eastern Bengal Railway, approached the government with a proposal to lay a steam tramway from Siliguri to Darjeeling. Ashley Eden, lieutenant governor of Bengal, formed a committee to assess the project&#x27;s feasibility. The proposal was accepted in 1879 after a positive report by the committee, and construction began that year.

Gillanders, Arbuthnot and Company was hired to construct the line and, by March 1880, track was laid as far as Tindharia, and Lord Lytton, the first viceroy to visit Darjeeling, rode to Tindharia on the train. Colonel F.S. Taylor, R.E., Consulting Engineer to the Government of India for Guaranteed Railways, and Franklin Prestage inspected the line and authorised the stretch from Siliguri to Kurseong open for traffic from 16 August 1880. It opened a few days later on 23 August 1880. The stretch from Siliguri to Darjeeling opened on 4 July 1881. The company&#x27;s name was changed to Darjeeling Himalayan Railway Company.

Although the railway originally followed Hill Cart Road, the steepness of the road was more than the locomotives could handle in some areas. In 1882, four loops and four zig-zags were built between Sukna and Gayabari to ease the gradient to a uniform 1 in 28. The line was extended by a quarter-mile to Darjeeling Bazar in 1886. The Darjeeling station was renovated in 1891 and Kurseong got a new station building and storage shed in 1896, but the railway was affected by an 1897 earthquake and a major cyclone in 1899. In 1902, heavy rains caused many landslips along the route and the Teesta bridge was washed away. Services were maintained with transhipments at the breaks.

In 1910, the DHR carried 174,000 passengers and 47,000 tons of goods. The first bogie carriages entered service, replacing basic four-wheel carriages. DHR extension lines were built to Kishanganj in 1914 and Gielkhola in 1915. At Tindharia, the railway works were relocated from behind the locomotive shed to a larger site.

The Batasia Loop was constructed in 1919, creating easier gradients on the ascent from Darjeeling. The DHR began facing competition from buses operating on the Hill Cart Road which took less time than the railway to reach Darjeeling. In 1934, a major earthquake in Bihar shook all of Northeast India. Many buildings in Darjeeling were heavily damaged and the railway was also affected, although it soon recovered and played a vital role in transporting repair materials. During World War II, the DHR transported military personnel and supplies to the camps around Ghum and Darjeeling.

In 1951, the railway was purchased by the Indian government and absorbed into the government railway organisation before it was managed by the Assam Railway. Assam Railway (including the DHR) became part of the North Eastern Railway zone in 1952, and part of Indian Railways&#x27; Northeast Frontier Railway zone six years later. In 1962, the railway was realigned at Siliguri and extended by nearly to New Jalpaiguri (NJP) to meet the new broad-gauge line there. The extension began freight service that year, and passenger service in 1964. The locomotive shed and carriage depot at Siliguri Junction were moved to NJP.

The railway was closed for 18 months during the Gorkhaland hostilities in 1988 and 1989. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, the service was stopped for 18 months from March 2020 to August 2021. On 25 August 2021, the service was restarted from New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling with the new vistadome coaches for the tourists.
==Operators==
The DHR and its assets, including the stations, line and vehicles, is owned by the government of India and entrusted to the Ministry of Railways. The Northeast Frontier Railway documented the railway in a comprehensive register, and handles its day-to-day maintenance and management. Several programs, divisions and departments of Indian Railways are responsible for operating, maintaining and repairing the DHR. It is protected by the 1989 Railway Act and the stipulations governing public property. It is now headed by the director, Darjeeling Himalayan Railway.

===Present===
====Steam====
All the steam locomotives currently in use on the railway are B-Class, built by Sharp, Stewart and Company and later the North British Locomotive Company between 1889 and 1925. A total of 34 were built but, by 2005, only 12 were still in use or being repaired by the railway.

In 2002, No. 787 was rebuilt for oil firing on the same principle as that used on Nilgiri Mountain Railway No. 37395. A diesel-powered generator was fitted to operate the oil burner and an electrically driven feed pump, and a diesel-powered compressor was fitted to power the braking system. The locomotive was also fitted with a feedwater heater. The rebuild dramatically changed its appearance. Trials of the refitted locomotive were disappointing, and it never entered regular service; in early 2011, it was in the Tindharia Works awaiting re-conversion to coal-firing. In early 2019, B787 was restored cosmetically and is now displayed on a plinth outside Siliguri Junction station.

In March 2001, No. 794 was transferred to the Matheran Hill Railway for a &quot;joy train&quot; (a steam-hauled tourist train) on that railway. It entered service there in May 2002.

====Diesel====

Six diesel locomotives are in use: Nos. 600–605 of the NDM-6 class.

===Past===

The DHR purchased the third Garratt locomotive built, a D Class , in 1910. Only one DHR steam locomotive has been taken out of India: DHR 778 (originally No. 19). After many years out of use at the Hesston Steam Museum, it was sold to Adrian Shooter in the UK and restored to working order. It was based for nearly 20 years at the privately owned Beeches Light Railway in Oxfordshire, and visited the Ffestiniog Railway, the Launceston Steam Railway and the Leighton Buzzard Light Railway during this time. In 2023, it was sold at auction to a newly formed trust who will keep it at the Statfold Barn Railway, and after the next overhaul plan to take the locomotive to other 2 ft gauge railways.

==Route==
The line follows Hill Cart Road, which is part of National Highway 110. The track is on the roadside for long stretches, and both track and road might be blocked by a rockslide. Since a length of the road is flanked with buildings, the railway line often resembles urban tramway tracks. To warn pedestrians and drivers of an approaching train, engines are equipped with very loud horns and whistles which train drivers sound almost constantly.

A major difficulty faced by the DHR was the steepness of the terrain. Loops and zig-zags were incorporated along the route to achieve a comfortable gradient. When the train moves forward, reverses and then moves forward again (climbing a slope while doing so), it gains altitude along the side of the hill.

===Stations===
*New Jalpaiguri (NJP): New Jalpaiguri was the terminus of the 1964 southern extension to meet the new broad gauge line to Assam.
*Siliguri Town: The line&#x27;s original southern terminus
*Siliguri Junction: Siliguri Junction became a major station when a new line was built to Assam during the early 1950s. From NJP to Siliguri Junction, the broad gauge line runs parallel to the DHR.
*Sukna: This station begins a change in the landscape, from flat plains to the wooded lower slopes of the mountains. The gradient of the railway changes dramatically. Loop 1, in the woods above Sukna, was removed after flood damage in 1991 and the site is obscured by the forest.
*Rangtong: A short distance above Rangtong is a water tank, better positioned than at the station in terms of water supply and distance from other water tanks. Loop 2 was removed in 1942 after flood damage. A new reverse, No. 1, was added for the longest reverse run. Loop No. 3, at Chunbatti, is now the lowest loop. Reverses No. 2 and 3 are between Chunbatti and Tindharia.
*Tindharia: Workshops are below the station. An office for engineers and a large locomotive shed are on a separate site. Above the station are three sidings, used to inspect the carriage while the locomotive is changed before the train continues towards Darjeeling.
*Loop 4: Known as Agony Point, the loop has the line&#x27;s tightest curve.
*Reverse No. 6: The last reverse on the climb
*Mahanadi
*Kurseong: Although a shed and several sidings are adjacent to the main line, the station proper is a dead end. Darjeeling-bound trains must back out of the station (across a busy road junction) to continue the climb. The station houses a one-room DHR museum with several exhibits, artifacts and vintage photos. At the centre of the room, a wooden showcase contains several old newspaper articles about the railway. After the station, the railway passes a busy shopping area.
*Tung
*Sonada
*Rongbull
*Jorebungalow: A storage point for tea bound for Kolkata, it connects Darjeeling to the rest of India.
*Ghum: Ghum, the line&#x27;s summit, is India&#x27;s highest station. The station building includes a first-floor museum, with larger exhibits in the old goods yard.
*Batasia Loop: The loop is from Darjeeling, below Ghum. There is a memorial to the Gorkha soldiers of the Indian Army who sacrificed their lives after Indian independence in 1947. The loop has a panoramic view of Darjeeling, with Kangchenjunga and other snow-capped mountains in the background.
*Darjeeling: The terminus of the line

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 10 January 2017 a Darjeeling train derailed due to a faulty track, and 10 people were injured.
*On 7 May 2019 a train struck a car and derailed. No one was killed or injured.
* On 9 October 2019 a passenger on the train fell off it while taking a selfie. The person died from serious head injuries from the fall.

==In popular culture==

The Earl of Ronaldshay described a journey on the railway in the early 1920s:

Siliguri is palpably a place of meeting ... The discovery that here the metre gauge system ends and the two-foot gauge of the Darjeeling-Himalayan railway begins, confirms what all these things hint at ... One steps into a railway carriage which might easily be mistaken for a toy, and the whimsical idea seizes hold of one that one has accidentally stumbled into Lilliput. With a noisy fuss out of all proportion to its size the engine gives a jerk – and starts ... No special mechanical device such as a rack is employed – unless, indeed, one can so describe the squat and stolid hill-man who sits perched over the forward buffers of the engine and scatters sand on the rails when the wheels of the engine lose their grip of the metals and race, with the noise of a giant spring running down when the control has been removed. Sometimes we cross our own track after completing the circuit of a cone, at others we zigzag backwards and forwards; but always we climb at a steady gradient – so steady that if one embarks in a trolley at Ghum, the highest point on the line, the initial push supplies all the energy necessary to carry one to the bottom.

The trip to Darjeeling by rail has changed little since that time, and remains popular with travelers and rail enthusiasts. Like tea and the Ghurka culture, the DHR has become an essential feature of the landscape and an enduring part of Darjeeling&#x27;s identity.

===Film===
Several films have depicted the railway. Protagonist Rajesh Khanna sings &quot;Mere Sapno Ki Rani&quot; to heroine Sharmila Tagore, who is on the train, in the 1969 film &quot;Aradhana&quot;. Other films which include the railway are &quot;Barfi!&quot;, &quot;Parineeta&quot; and &quot;Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman&quot;. An anthropomorphized version of one of the B-Class locomotives appears briefly in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Planes&quot; (2013) when an airplane flies through a tunnel and nearly collides with the train.

The BBC series &quot;The World About Us&quot; made a documentary episode about the Indian Railways in 1975, titled &quot;The Romance of Indian Railways&quot;. The documentary included a section on Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, with colour footage of the original steam trains in use.

The BBC made a series of three documentaries on the mountain railways of India, which was first broadcast in February 2010. The first episode covers the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the second the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and the third the Kalka–Shimla Railway. The documentaries, directed by Tarun Bhartiya, Hugo Smith and Nick Mattingly, were produced by Gerry Troyna. The documentary on Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was directed by Tarun Bhartiya. The series won the UK Royal Television Society Award in June 2010.

<text>Charles Hart is an English lyricist, librettist and songwriter arguably best known for his work on &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; as well as a number of other musicals and operas for both stage and television.

== Life and works ==
Hart was born in London in 1961, the son of George Wilson Hart, an antiquarian book dealer, and Juliet Lavinia Hart (née Byam Shaw), actress. His parents had met as actors through theatre but his maternal grand-parents, Glen Byam Shaw and Angela Baddeley, continued actively working in theatre and music throughout his childhood. Hart began writing lyrics as a child, some of which were &quot;dark and contemplative – precociously murderous and quite, quite feisty&quot;. He went to school in Maidenhead over the same period when his grandmother was starring in a London stage production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;. Hart went on to study music at Robinson College, Cambridge, followed by postgraduate studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in music composition in 1984. Soon after leaving Guildhall, Hart came to the attention of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh, while they were judging the Vivian Ellis awards. Webber hired him as a lyricist for &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; a year later, which opened in 1986. In an interview published the day before the opening of &quot;Phantom&quot;, Hart said, &quot;my ambition was to be an English Sondheim. Being a lyricist is the ideal job for a university-educated dilettante, because it uses up all the rubbish in your education.&quot;

In 1990, during Stephen Sondheim’s tenure as “Professor of Musical Theatre” at Oxford, Hart linked up with like-minded writers George Stiles, Anthony Drewe and Howard Goodall, and in 1992, they founded the Mercury Workshop. The collaborative merged with the New Musical Alliance to become Mercury Musical Developments in 1999 and is today a registered charity whose patron was Stephen Sondheim. Hart went on to collaborate with Howard Goodall on a number of successful musicals.

<text>The Treaty of Deabolis () was an agreement made in 1108 between Bohemond I of Antioch and Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, in the wake of the First Crusade. It is named after the Byzantine fortress of Deabolis (modern Devol, Albania). Although the treaty was not immediately enforced, it was intended to make the Principality of Antioch a vassal state of the Byzantine Empire.

At the beginning of the First Crusade, crusader armies assembled at Constantinople and promised to return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might conquer. However, Bohemond, the son of Alexios&#x27; former enemy Robert Guiscard, claimed Antioch for himself. Alexios did not recognize the legitimacy of the principality, and Bohemond went to Europe looking for reinforcements. He launched into open warfare against Alexios, laying siege to Dyrrhachium, but he was soon forced to surrender and negotiate with Alexios at the imperial camp at Deabolis, where the Treaty was signed.

Under the terms of the Treaty, Bohemond agreed to become a vassal of the emperor and to defend the Empire whenever needed. He also accepted the appointment of a Greek patriarch. In return, he was given the titles of &quot;sebastos&quot; and &quot;doux&quot; (duke) of Antioch, and he was guaranteed the right to pass on to his heirs the County of Edessa. Following this, Bohemond retreated to Apulia and died there. His nephew, Tancred, who was regent in Antioch, refused to accept the terms of the treaty. Antioch came temporarily under Byzantine sway in 1137, but it was not until 1158 that it truly became a Byzantine vassal.

The Treaty of Deabolis is viewed as a typical example of the Byzantine tendency to settle disputes through diplomacy rather than warfare, and was both a result of and a cause for the distrust between the Byzantines and their Western European neighbors.

==Background==

In 1097, the crusader armies assembled at Constantinople having traveled in groups eastward through Europe. Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who had requested only some western knights to serve as mercenaries to help fight the Seljuk Turks, blockaded these armies in the city and would not permit them to leave until their leaders swore oaths promising to restore to the Empire any land formerly belonging to it that they might conquer on the way to Jerusalem. The crusaders eventually swore these oaths, individually rather than as a group. In return, Alexios gave them guides and a military escort. The crusaders were however exasperated by Byzantine tactics, such as negotiating the surrender of Nicaea from the Seljuks while it was still under siege by the crusaders, who hoped to plunder it to help finance their journey. The crusaders, feeling betrayed by Alexios, who was able to recover a number of important cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor, continued on their way without Byzantine aid. In 1098, when Antioch had been captured after a long siege and the crusaders were in turn themselves besieged in the city, Alexios marched out to meet them, but, hearing from Stephen of Blois that the situation was hopeless, he returned to Constantinople. The crusaders, who had unexpectedly withstood the siege, believed Alexios had abandoned them and considered the Byzantines completely untrustworthy. Therefore, they regarded their oaths as invalidated.

By 1100, there were several crusader states, including the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch should be returned to the Byzantines, despite Alexios&#x27;s supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an important Eastern Orthodox patriarch of Antioch. It had only been captured from the empire a few decades previously, unlike Jerusalem, which was much farther away and had not been in Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, believing it should be returned to the Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097. He therefore set about trying to evict Bohemond from Antioch.

Bohemond added a further insult to both Alexios and the Eastern Orthodox Church in 1100 when he appointed Bernard of Valence as the Latin patriarch, and the same time expelled the Greek patriarch, John the Oxite, who fled to Constantinople. Soon after, Bohemond was captured by the Danishmends of Syria and was imprisoned for three years, during which the Antiochenes chose his nephew Tancred as regent. After Bohemond was released, he was defeated by the Seljuks at the Battle of Harran in 1104; this defeat led to renewed pressure on Antioch from both the Seljuks and the Byzantines. Bohemond left Tancred in control of Antioch and returned in the West, touring Italy and France for reinforcements. He won the backing of Pope Paschal II and the support of the French King Philip I, whose daughter he married. It is unclear whether his expedition qualified as a crusade.

Bohemond&#x27;s Norman relatives in Sicily had been in conflict with the Byzantine Empire for over 30 years; his father Robert Guiscard was one of the Empire&#x27;s most formidable enemies. While Bohemond was away, Alexios sent an army to reoccupy Antioch and the cities of Cilicia. In 1107, having organized a new army for his planned crusade against the Muslims in Syria, Bohemond instead launched into open warfare against Alexios, crossing the Adriatic to lay siege to Dyrrhachium, the westernmost city of the Empire. Like his father however, Bohemond was unable to make any significant advances into the Empire&#x27;s interior; Alexios avoided a pitched battle and Bohemond&#x27;s siege failed, partly due to a plague among his army. Bohemond soon found himself in an impossible position, isolated in front of Dyrrhachium: his escape by sea was cut off by the Venetians, and Paschal II withdrew his support.

==Settlements==

In September 1108, Alexios requested that Bohemond negotiate with him at the imperial camp at Diabolis (Devol). Bohemond had no choice but to accept, now that his disease-stricken army would no longer be able to defeat Alexios in battle. He admitted that he had violated the oath sworn in 1097, but refused to acknowledge that it had any bearing on the present circumstances, as Alexios, in Bohemond&#x27;s eyes, had also violated the agreement by turning back from the siege of Antioch in 1098. Alexios agreed to consider the oaths of 1097 invalid. The specific terms of the treaty were negotiated by the general Nikephoros Bryennios, and were recorded by Anna Komnene:

*Bohemond agreed to become a vassal of the emperor, and also of Alexios&#x27; son and heir John;
*He agreed to help defend the empire, wherever and whenever he was required to do so, and agreed to an annual payment of 200 talents in return for this service;
*He was given the title of &quot;sebastos&quot;, as well as &quot;doux&quot; (duke) of Antioch;
*He was granted as imperial fiefs Antioch and Aleppo (the latter of which neither the Crusaders nor the Byzantines controlled, but it was understood that Bohemond should try to conquer it);
*He agreed to return Laodicea and other Cilician territories to Alexios;
*He agreed to let Alexios appoint a Greek patriarch &quot;among the disciples of the great church of Constantinople&quot; (The restoration of the Greek patriarch marked the acceptance of submission to the empire, but posed canonical questions, which were difficult to resolve).

The terms were negotiated according to Bohemond&#x27;s western understanding, so that he saw himself as a feudal vassal of Alexios, a &quot;liege man&quot; (&quot;homo ligius&quot; or ) with all the obligations this implied, as customary in the West: he was obliged to bring military assistance to the Emperor, except in wars in which he was involved, and to serve him against all his enemies, in Europe and in Asia.

Anna Komnene described the proceedings with very repetitive details, with Bohemond frequently pointing out his own mistakes and praising the benevolence of Alexios and the Empire; the proceedings must have been rather humiliating for Bohemond. On the other hand, Anna&#x27;s work was meant to praise her father and the terms of the treaty may not be entirely accurate.

The oral agreement was written down in two copies, one given to Alexios, and the other given to Bohemond. According to Anna, the witnesses from Bohemond&#x27;s camp who signed his copy of the treaty were Maurus, bishop of Amalfi and papal legate, Renard, bishop of Tarentum, and the minor clergy accompanying them; the abbot of the monastery of St. Andrew in Brindisi, along with two of his monks; and a number of unnamed &quot;pilgrims&quot; (probably soldiers in Bohemond&#x27;s army). From Alexios&#x27; imperial court, the treaty was witnessed by the &quot;sebastos&quot; Marinos of Naples, Roger son of Dagobert, Peter Aliphas, William of Gand, Richard of the Principate, Geoffrey of Mailli, Hubert son of Raoul, Paul the Roman, envoys from the Queen&#x27;s relation (from the family of the former cral/king of Bulgaria), the ambassadors Peres and Simon from Hungary, and the ambassadors Basil the Eunuch and Constantine. Many of Alexios&#x27; witnesses were themselves Westerners, who held high positions in the Byzantine army and at the imperial court; Basil and Constantine were ambassadors in the service of Bohemond&#x27;s relatives in Sicily.

Neither copy survives. It may have been written in Latin, Greek, or both. Both languages are equally likely given the number of westerners present, many of whom would have known Latin. It is not clear how far Bohemond&#x27;s concessions were known across Latin Europe
as only a few chroniclers mention the treaty at all; Fulcher of Chartres simply says
that Bohemond and Alexios were reconciled.

==Analysis==

The Treaty was weighted in Alexios&#x27; favor and provided for the eventual absorption of Antioch and its territory into the Empire. Alexios, recognizing the impossibility of driving Bohemond out of Antioch, tried to absorb him into the structure of Byzantine rule, and put him to work for the Empire&#x27;s benefit. Bohemond was to retain Antioch until his death with the title of &quot;doux&quot;, unless the emperor (either Alexios or, in the future, John) chose for any reason to renege on the deal. The principality would revert to direct Byzantine rule on Bohemond&#x27;s death. Bohemond therefore could not set up a dynasty in Antioch, although he was guaranteed the right to pass on to his heirs the County of Edessa, and any other territories he managed to acquire in the Syrian interior.

Bohemond&#x27;s lands were to include St Simeon and the coast, the towns of Baghras and Artah, and the Latin possessions in the Jebel as-Summaq. Latakia and Cilicia, however, were to revert to direct Byzantine rule. As Thomas Asbridge points out, much of what the Emperor granted to Bohemond (including Aleppo itself) was still in Muslim hands (e.g. neither Bohemond nor Alexios controlled Edessa, although at the time Tancred was regent there as well as in Antioch), which contradicts Lilie&#x27;s assessment that Bohemond did well out of the Treaty. René Grousset calls the Treaty a &quot;Diktat&quot;, but Jean Richard underscores that the rules of feudal law to which Bohemond had to submit &quot;were in no way humiliating.&quot; According to John W. Birkenmeier, the Treaty marked the point at which Alexios had developed a new army, and new tactical doctrines with which to use it, but it was not a Byzantine political success; &quot;it traded Bohemond&#x27;s freedom for a titular overlordship of Southern Italy that could never be effective, and for an occupation of Antioch that could never be carried out.&quot;

The terms of the Treaty have been interpreted in various ways. According to Paul Magdalino and Ralph-Johannes Lilie, &quot;the Treaty as reproduced by Anna Komnene shows an astonishing familiarity with western feudal custom; whether it was drafted by a Greek or by a Latin in imperial service, it had a sensitive regard for the western view of the &quot;status quo&quot; in the East Mediterranean.&quot; So too did the diplomatic initiatives Alexios undertook, in order to enforce the Treaty on Tancred (such as the treaty he concluded with Pisa in 1110–1111, and the negotiations for Church union with Pascal II in 1112). In contrast, Asbridge has recently argued that the Treaty derived from Greek as well as western precedents, and that Alexios wished to regard Antioch as falling under the umbrella of &quot;pronoia&quot; arrangements.

==Aftermath==
Bohemond never returned to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond&#x27;s nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. 
The question of the status of Antioch and the adjacent Cilician cities troubled the Empire for many years afterwards. Although the Treaty of Deabolis never came into effect, it provided the legal basis for Byzantine negotiations with the crusaders for the next thirty years, and for imperial claims to Antioch during the reigns of John II and Manuel I. Therefore, John II attempted to impose his authority, traveling to Antioch himself in 1137 with his army and besieging the city. The citizens of Antioch tried to negotiate, but John demanded the unconditional surrender of the city. After asking the permission of the King of Jerusalem, Fulk, which he received, Raymond, the Prince of Antioch, agreed to surrender the city to John. The agreement, by which Raymond swore homage to John, was explicitly based on the Treaty of Deabolis, but went beyond it: Raymond, who was recognized as an imperial vassal for Antioch, promised the Emperor free entry to Antioch, and undertook to hand over the city in return for investiture with Aleppo, Shaizar, Homs and Hama as soon as these were conquered from the Muslims. Then, Raymond would rule the new conquests and Antioch would revert to direct imperial rule. The campaign finally failed, however, partly because Raymond and Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, who had been obliged to join John as his vassals, did not pull their weight. When, on their return to Antioch, John insisted on taking possession of the city, the two princes organized a riot. John found himself besieged in the city, and was forced to leave in 1138, recalled to Constantinople. He diplomatically accepted Raymond&#x27;s and Joscelin&#x27;s insistence that they had nothing to do with the rebellion. John repeated his operation in 1142, but he unexpectedly died, and the Byzantine army retired.
It was not until 1158, during the reign of Manuel I, that Antioch truly became a vassal of the empire, after Manuel forced Prince Raynald of Châtillon to swear fealty to him in punishment for Raynald&#x27;s attack on Byzantine Cyprus. The Greek patriarch was restored, and ruled simultaneously with the Latin patriarch. Antioch, weakened by powerless regents after Raynald&#x27;s capture by the Muslims in 1160, remained a Byzantine vassal state until 1182 when internal divisions following Manuel&#x27;s death in 1180 hindered the Empire&#x27;s ability to enforce its claim.

In the Balkan frontier, the Treaty of Deabolis marked the end of the Norman threat to the southern Adriatic littoral during Alexios&#x27; reign and later; the efficacy of the frontier defenses deterred any further invasions through Dyrrachium for most of the 12th century.

<text>The Opel Calibra is a coupé, engineered and produced by the German automaker Opel between 1989 and 1997. In the United Kingdom, where it remained on sale until 1999, it was marketed under the Vauxhall brand as the Vauxhall Calibra. It was also marketed as the Chevrolet Calibra in South America by Chevrolet, and the Holden Calibra in Australia and New Zealand by Holden.

The Calibra was introduced to belatedly replace the Manta and to counter the Japanese sporting coupés of the period. It employs the running gear of the first generation Opel Vectra, which had been launched in October 1988. Calibra production was based in the Opel factory in Rüsselsheim, Germany, and the Valmet Automotive factory in Uusikaupunki, Finland, where production was consolidated in November 1995. The Calibra was initially only available with front-wheel drive, but from November 1990, four wheel drive became available.

== Design ==


The Opel Calibra was styled by GM&#x27;s designer Wayne Cherry, and German designer Erhard Schnell. As a front-wheel drive three door hatchback coupé based on the Vectra A chassis, its ride and handling are not significantly better than that of the large family car from which it grew. Though it had a stiffer chassis as a whole (better torsional rigidity in NM/Deg). The 4WD turbo version of the car, which had independent rear suspension, featured the rear axle of the Omega A with some minor alterations to it. Irmscher suspension on the sporty limited editions (like DTM, Keke Rosberg, Cliff and Last Edition) also had sharper handling than base models.

The Vectra A chassis and hatchback rear meant the Calibra was relatively practical compared to many other coupés of this size. It could seat four average-sized passengers (above 175–180 cm only compromised in the rear) and hold 300 liters of luggage.

An innovative design feature was the slim 7 cm high headlamp, which was possible to create using the then new ellipsoid technology developed in conjunction with Hella. The headlamp design was key to the sport coupé&#x27;s unique design and aerodynamics.

When launched on 10 June 1989, the Calibra was the most aerodynamic production car in the world, with a drag coefficient (Cd) of &quot;0.26&quot;. To reach the record Cd figure, the prototype Calibra had to be taken to the DNW wind tunnel in the Nederlands where models could be tested above a rolling road simulating real life airflow. For the final design smaller alterations were made on the preliminary models: tapering the rear waistline and rear side windows by about 50 mm compared to earlier mockups gave about 0,035 Cd improvement, while another 0,035 improvement was reached by altering panel lines, transition points, integrated front spoiler in front of the tires, engine shield and a panel connecting the fuel tank and the lower edge of the rear bumper. The Calibra remained the most aerodynamic mass production car for the next ten years, until the Honda Insight was launched in November 1999, with a Cd of &quot;0.25&quot;.

All later 16V, V6, 4x4 and turbo models had a worse Cd of &quot;0.29&quot;, due to changes in cooling system, underbody, use of spoked wheels and glass detail.

== Commercial life ==
During its lifetime, the Calibra was much more popular in Europe, and outsold its nearest rival, the Ford Probe, which was considered to be underpowered, and very American for most European drivers. Sales of the Vauxhall-badged versions for the UK market commenced in June 1990, with hopes of selling of up to 15,000 examples per year. However, this sales target was never achieved.

In July 1990, after General Motors bought a stake in Saab, it was reported the Calibra would be badged as a Saab in the United States, but these plans did not materialise. There were also plans for a cabriolet version to be produced, but these too failed to materialise.

In the summer of 1994, the Calibra received a light facelift. Most noticeably, the manufacturer badge migrated from its place atop the leading edge of the bonnet into the front grille. Equipment and safety have been developed. Throughout the production run, several special models were launched.

In the United Kingdom, this began with the &#x27;Tickford&#x27; conversion in October 1991, however, only 26 Calibras were ever converted. This was followed by Vauxhall&#x27;s own Special Edition range the SE1 in 1993, and ran through to the SE9 in 1997. These limited run editions had often unique aspects. For example, solar yellow paint on the SE2, or &quot;Icelandic&quot; blue on the SE6. Neither colours were found on any other Calibra in the UK. 

There was also a Keke Rosberg edition first only available in white, in celebration of the Calibra&#x27;s success in the German Touring Car Championship at the time. In other parts of Europe, special models included the &quot;DTM&quot; edition, the &quot;Cliff&quot; edition, the &quot;Colour&quot; edition, &quot;Last&quot; edition and some special editions only available on certain domestic markets. Some special models sold in continental Europe included lowered Irmscher suspension and a numbered plaque on the ashtray. &quot;DTM&quot; and &quot;Keke Rosberg&quot; featured yellow-gray pattern textile upholstery as standard to remind buyers the colors of Opel DTM racecars. According to different data sources, as well as numbered plaques usually seen on car meets and on the internet the &quot;Keke Rosberg&quot;, &quot;DTM&quot;, &quot;Cliff&quot; and &quot;Last Edition&quot; cars were produced in relatively low numbers (roughly around a thousand cars per edition).

The last Calibra Turbos were produced in the beginning of 1997, before a final run of Calibra Turbo Limited Editions were rolled out to the UK market. These were all finished in jet black paintwork with an Irmscher spoiler, BBS RX 16&quot; alloys and colour coded body fittings. This final version was also lowered by 35mm on Irmscher springs and dampers. The interior was finished in heated cream leather, with a steering wheel trimmed in grey leather and a plaque showing the build number mounted on the centre console.

In continental Europe, the Last Edition was the final limited edition, offering basically all extras, plenty of colors and full Irmscher set including front bumper, sports suspension and BBS RX 16&quot; alloys.

The Vectra A was replaced in September 1995, but Calibra production continued until June 1997. Although a smaller coupé (the Tigra) was available, the marque was left without a mid sized coupé until the Astra Coupé was launched in the spring of 2000, and with the introduction of the Opel Speedster two-seater roadster in July 2000, three years after the Calibra was discontinued, Opel finally offered a sports car again.

There is different data available about production numbers: 238,164 or 238,647 or 239,118 have been built in total. 93,978 have been built in Valmet, Finland. Nearly 130,000 were fitted with 8V, 83,000 with 16V, 14,000 with Turbo and 12,000 with V6 engines. Around 100,000 were sold in Germany, over 40,000 in the UK, more than 27,000 in Italy, over 17,000 in Spain, around 13,000 in France and over 10,000 in Switzerland giving the major markets of the Calibra. Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands contributed 5,000 units apiece. Only a portion of the fleet remain on the roads: in Germany around 5,060 cars, in the UK around 450 cars, and in the Netherlands, around 750.

== Equipment ==
Both standard and optional equipment were considerably developed throughout the production.

At the beginning of the production the standard equipment of the Calibra 8 valve was a 20 W two-speaker stereo with cassette player, sports seats front with adjustable height on the driver&#x27;s side, split folding rear seats, ABS, power steering, electric side mirror adjustment, analog clock on the middle console, makeup mirrors in the sunvisors, lockable glovebox, tinted windows, 14-inch alloy wheels and bumpers in body color. Features like air-conditioning, electric windows, fog light, board computer and sun roof were optional.

By contrast better equipped facelifted models with larger engines offered air-conditioning, traction control, electric windows, a 30W 6 speaker stereo system (or 150 W Bose with 6 speaker plus additional subwoofer), CD-changer, central locking, immobiliser, leather upholstery with heated front seats, board computer, sunroof, two airbags with pre-tensioners, alarm system with motion sensors, 15 or 16 inch alloy wheels, etc.

=== Exterior colors ===
The Opel Calibra was available in 28 colors throughout the production run, out of which only 9 were black, gray or white. Although only about a half dozen colors were offered simultaneously at certain time periods, meaning colors on the palette were changed quickly. Limited editions usually featured even less color options, than the standard. During the total production period the following colors were available indicated with code, original German and English names and type of lack:

In the case of the &quot;Cliff Motorsport Edition&quot; the following color names were applied: Ocean = Magneticblau, Polar = Karibikblau, Barracuda = Keramikblau. Some late &quot;Keke Rosberg&quot; and &quot;DTM&quot; models were painted in colors from the standard palette. Colors and special editions offered may be different on certain domestic markets.

== Engines ==
Power was initially from a 2.0 litre 8 valve C20NE, and a Cosworth designed 16 valve fuel injected C20XE four cylinder redtop petrol engine.

For 1992, a turbocharged 2.0 litre 16 valve engine C20LET (turbocharged version of the C20XE) was added to the range. With four wheel drive, a six speed Getrag manual transmission (F28/6) and a claimed top speed of 245 km/h (152 mph).

The Turbo model was also notable for the five stud wheel hubs and the extreme negative camber (inward lean) of its rear wheels.

In 1993, a 2.5 litre V6 (C25XE or SE4) was introduced, available with both manual and automatic transmissions. The V6 was not as fast as the Turbo, but was rather more civilised, and proved to be more reliable than the complex four wheel drive model. 1995 saw the introduction of the X20XEV &quot;Ecotec&quot; engine, a new version of the classic C20XE 16 valve or &quot;red top&quot; engine.

This marked a reduction in power from to for the 16 valve version, although the Turbo continued with the C20LET.

* 2.0 litre 8 valve SOHC I4 – (all years) (C20NE)
* 2.0 litre 16 valve DOHC I4 – (1990–1995) (C20XE or redtop)
* 2.0 litre 16 valve DOHC &quot;Ecotec&quot; I4 – (1995–1997) (X20XEV)
* 2.0 litre 16 valve DOHC turbocharged I4 – (1992–1997) (C20LET)
* 2.5 litre 24 valve DOHC &quot;Ecotec&quot; V6 – (1993–1997) (C25XE from 1994 to 1996; X25XE in 1997)
The availability of engines is dependent on specific model variants, accessory levels and domestic markets.

=== Technical data ===

== Transmissions ==
In addition to the Aisin four-speed automatic transmissions that were available on all models, except the C20LET (although some countries such as Australia did not sell the C20XE with the four-speed auto), there were five manual gearboxes produced by Getrag (all of which were five speed gearboxes, except the six speed F28/6).
* F16CR-5 – Fitted to early 2.0 litre SOHC NA (i.e. C20NE)
* F18CR-5 – Fitted to late 2.0 litre SOHC NA and late 2.0 litre DOHC NA (i.e. C20NE, X20XEV)
* F20 – Fitted to early 2.0 litre DOHC NA (i.e. C20XE)
* F25 – Fitted to 2.5 litre NA (i.e. C25XE, X25XE)
* F28/6 – Fitted to 2.0 litre Turbo (i.e. C20LET)
* AF20 – Fitted to late 2.0 litre SOHC NA and late 2.0 litre DOHC NA (i.e. C20NE, X20XEV) and 2.5 litre NA (i.e. C25XE, X25XE)

The transfer gearbox in the AWD models — the same as used in the Vauxhall Cavalier AWD—was somewhat on the flimsy side, liable to suffer damage from conditions such as minor differences in tyre wear or tyre pressure between front and rear axles. Since front and rear tyres would naturally wear at different rates in normal driving, it was necessary to swap front with rear tyres every - recent user recommendations propose 3,000 miles (5,000 km).

All four tyres had to be of the same make and model, and all four tyres had to be replaced at the same time — if one tyre was damaged or punctured, the three remaining good tyres also had to be replaced. In addition there were other maintenance requirements which were both exacting and unusual. Neglect of these points through ignorance or a misconceived attempt to save money was common, and was likely to lead to very expensive failures of the transfer gearbox.

== Dimensions ==

* Length: 4492 mm
* Width (without mirrors): 1688 mm
* Height (empty): 1320 mm
* Wheelbase: 2600 mm
* Track front/rear: 1426/1446 mm
* Tyres: &quot;175/70 R 14&quot; or &quot;195/60 R 14 85 V, 195/60 R 15&quot; or &quot;205/55 R 15&quot; and &quot;205/50 R 16 87 W&quot;
* Turning circle: 11,44 m

== Safety and Sustainability ==
The Calibra featured four types of recycled materials, used in parts such as the headlight frames, water deflector, bumper attachments, inlet manifold, and fender liners. Waterbased paint and CFC-free air-conditioning were also steps taken for sustainability.

Since the beginning of 1993 all Calibras were delivered with a driver&#x27;s airbag as standard, and co-driver&#x27;s full size airbag was added in August. Amongst other small changes during the ongoing development program, other important safety features were added in August 1993: double steel tube strengthening bars in the doors as side crash protection, strengthened door sills, strengthened pillars and roof frame, and seat belt pre-tensioners also became standard for front passengers.

== Motorsport ==

=== Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft/FIA International Touring Car Championship ===
The DTM/ITC-specification race cars used an all-wheel-drive layout, with the engine mounted longitudinally instead of transversely. Early DTM cars used a naturally-aspirated Cosworth-developed 54-degree V6 engine based on General Motors&#x27; iron block/aluminium head C25XE. Power output improved from from 1993 to 1995.
Due to changes in the Group A Class 1 FIA regulations for 1996, a switch was made to an all-aluminium, 75-degree V6 based on the Isuzu 6VD1 (as used in the Trooper/Amigo). Using this engine, Opel won the 1996 ITC Championship. The Isuzu-based KF V6 was capable of revving to 15,000 rpm. The last known KF V6-powered Calibra race car in existence is the Zakspeed Calibra Concept 2 prototype. The car was built to be used as a test mule for the cancelled 1997 FIA ITC championship.

=== South African Wesbank Modifieds series ===

Wanting a car that would be competitive in the Wesbank Modifieds Series (at the time, South Africa&#x27;s premier circuit-racing series), South Africa&#x27;s Delta Motor Corporation commissioned a one-off Calibra race car. Owen Ashley Auto Developments, based in Cape Town, was contracted to design and build the car in late 1990, with financial backing from DMC. The car was designed around the then-current Class A rule set (broadly similar to that used in the American IMSA GT series).
The car was based around an aluminium honeycomb floorpan, to which was secured a chrome-moly steel spaceframe. DMC&#x27;s brief to Owen Ashley stated that as much of the standard Calibra silhouette as possible had to be retained. To that end, a standard Calibra roof, side body monocoque pressings, doors and rear window were used. All remaining bodywork was moulded in fibreglass.

The car was powered by a Buick 3800-derived, 3.5-litre all-aluminium odd-fire V6, similar in specification to that used on the IMSA Corvette GTP. Built in the United States by Ryan Falconer, the engine retained its original single-cam, pushrod-and-rocker, two-valves-per-cylinder layout, but employed a Racetronics engine management system and Garrett turbocharger aspirating through a 52mm restrictor plate. The engine produced approximately 600 BHP (447 kW) in race trim. Power was delivered to a rear-mounted five-speed manual Hewland transaxle through a carbon-fibre propeller shaft. Fuel capacity was 40 litres, and double-wishbone suspension was used at both the front and rear ends of the car.

Driven by Michael Briggs, the car was campaigned from 1991 to 1993. A rule change for 1994 that banned turbocharged engines from the series, as well as the rapidly increasing popularity of Group A super touring cars, compelled DMC to retire the Calibra in favour of devoting its motorsport budget and resources to its two-car Astra super touring effort.

===Rallying===
The Calibra Turbo was also rallied, albeit without notable success. A Calibra finished ninth in the 1992 Sanremo Rallye, with Bruno Thiry at the wheel. This did make it the fastest car in the 1600 to 2000 cc class.

== 1992 Calibra Cabrio Prototypes ==
Although the Coupé shape was so successful, that it was no real demand for a Calibra Cabrio, Valmet Automotive was entrusted by Opel to build fully functioning convertible Calibra prototypes, as competitors also started mid-size convertible development. Valmet Automotive built two red coloured prototypes in 1992, with the 2.0 litre, 8 valve engine. A third body was also produced for use in flexibility tests. With the convertible body, the Calibra lost the practicality of the rear seats and the boot, thus the design was not further developed. Now a red painted prototype is exhibited in the underground garage of Opel Classic at the concept car section.

== 1997 Calibra B Design Study ==
In 1996 Opel began the development of the successor of the Calibra on the basis of the Vectra B, but it didn&#x27;t fit the international model strategy of General Motors, so the project was dropped. One non-functioning 1:1 scale model from the beginning of 1997 remain, that has been kept hidden for more than twenty years, and revealed for public on the thirtieth anniversary of the Calibra A world premiere. Now the red painted model is exhibited in the underground garage of Opel Classic. As a non-functioning study, it had only a very schematic interior and two different type of headlights (left and right) to test various design solutions at the front.

== 2007 GTC Concept ==
The Opel GTC Concept of March 2007 was linked to the &quot;Calibra&quot; name, but no production version resulted from the concept car. The GTC concept car was rather a design projection for the first generation of Opel Insignia introduced next year, and especially its most powerful OPC version, which inherited the concept car&#x27;s large emphasized vertical intakes at the front, similar exhaust tips at the rear and rims on the side. The interior of the first generation Insignia is also very similar to the 2007 GTC Concept. The GTC Concept is showcased in the concept car section of Opel Classic.

<doc id="750467" wikidata="Q2704283" url="?curid=750467" title="Uranian (sexuality)">
<text>Uranian (from the Ancient Greek Aphrodite Urania (, )) is a historical term for homosexual men. The word was also used as an adjective in association with male homosexuality or inter-male attraction regardless of sexual orientation.

An early use of the term appears in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &#x27;Sixth Letter&#x27; in the &quot;Aesthetic Education of Man&quot; (1795–96). Schiller claims that state institutions are so jealous they would rather share their servants with a Cytherean Venus than a Uranian Venus. 
The term was used by activist Karl Heinrich Ulrichs in a series of five booklets from 1864 to 1865 collected under the title (&quot;The Riddle of Man–Manly Love&quot;). The term &quot;uranian&quot; was adopted by English-language advocates of homosexual emancipation in the Victorian era, such as Edward Carpenter and John Addington Symonds, who used it to describe a comradely love that would bring about true democracy. Oscar Wilde once wrote to his lover Robert Ross in an undated letter, &quot;To have altered my life would have been to have admitted that uranian love is ignoble. I hold it to be noble—more noble than other forms.&quot;

The term Uranians also designates a group of writers who studied classics and wrote pederastic poetry from roughly the 1870s to the 1930s. The writings of this group came to be known by the phrase Uranian poetry. The art of Henry Scott Tuke and Wilhelm von Gloeden is also sometimes referred to as Uranian.

==Etymology==
Ulrichs derived &quot;uranian&quot; ( in German) from a dialogue on &quot;eros&quot;, in particular male love, metaphorized by the birth of Greek goddess Aphrodite from Plato&#x27;s work &quot;Symposium&quot;.

In this dialogue, Pausanias distinguishes between two types of love, symbolized by two different accounts of the birth of Aphrodite, the goddess of love. was derived from Aphrodite Urania, who was created out of the god Uranus&#x27; semen, a birth in which &quot;female has no part&quot;, therefore representing love between men. Its counterpart, &quot;dionian&quot; ( in German), was derived from Aphrodite Dionea, the daughter of Zeus and Dione, associated with a common love which &quot;is apt to be of women as well as of youths, and is of the body rather than of the soul,&quot; representing for Ulrichs men&#x27;s love for women. Diverging from Plato&#x27;s account of masculine love, Ulrichs understood male to be essentially feminine and male to be masculine in nature.

Ulrichs developed his terminology before the first public use of the term &quot;gay&quot;.

John Addington Symonds was one of the first to take up the term &quot;uranian&quot; in the English language and is also responsible for its connection with Ulrichs&#x27; .

<doc id="750480" wikidata="Q37212" url="?curid=750480" title="Lemuriformes">
<text>Lemuriformes is the sole extant infraorder of primate that falls under the suborder Strepsirrhini. It includes the lemurs of Madagascar, as well as the galagos and lorisids of Africa and Asia, although a popular alternative taxonomy places the lorisoids in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes.

Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, lower part of the mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming.

==Evolutionary history==
Lemuriform origins are unclear and debated. American paleontologist Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved from one of several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not strongly supported due to a lack of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that immigrated to northern Africa.
Until discoveries of three 40-million-year-old fossil lorisoids (&quot;Karanisia&quot;, &quot;Saharagalago&quot;, and &quot;Wadilemur&quot;) in the El Fayum deposits of Egypt between 1997 and 2005, the oldest known lemuriforms had come from the early Miocene (~20 mya) of Kenya and Uganda. These newer finds demonstrate that lemuriform primates were present during the middle Eocene in Afro-Arabia and that the lemuriform lineage and all other strepsirrhine taxa had diverged before then. &quot;Djebelemur&quot; from Tunisia dates to the late early or early middle Eocene (52 to 46 mya) and has been considered a cercamoniine, but also may have been a stem lemuriform. Azibiids from Algeria date to roughly the same time and may be a sister group of the djebelemurids. Together with &quot;Plesiopithecus&quot; from the late Eocene Egypt, the three may qualify as the stem lemuriforms from Africa.

Molecular clock estimates indicate that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, approximately 62 mya. Between 47 and 54 mya, lemurs dispersed to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today. In Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, approximately 40 mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.

==Taxonomic classification==

Most of the academic literature provides a basic framework for primate taxonomy, usually including several potential taxonomic schemes. Although most experts agree upon phylogeny, many disagree about nearly every level of primate classification.

Within Strepsirrhini, two common classifications include either two infraorders (Adapiformes and Lemuriformes) or three infraorders (Adapiformes, Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes). A less common taxonomy places the aye-aye (Daubentoniidae) in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes. In some cases, plesiadapiforms are included within the order Primates, in which case Euprimates is sometimes treated as a suborder, with Strepsirrhini becoming an infraorder, and the Lemuriformes and others become parvorders. Regardless of the infraordinal taxonomy, crown strepsirrhines are composed of 10 families, three of which are extinct. These three extinct families included the giant lemurs of Madagascar, many of which died out within the last 1,000 years following human arrival on the island.

When Strepsirrhini is divided into two infraorders, the clade containing all toothcombed primates can be called &quot;lemuriforms&quot;. When it is divided into three infraorders, the term &quot;lemuriforms&quot; refers only to Madagascar&#x27;s lemurs, and the toothcombed primates are referred to as either &quot;crown strepsirrhines&quot; or &quot;extant strepsirrhines&quot;. Confusion of this specific terminology with the general term &quot;strepsirrhine&quot;, along with oversimplified anatomical comparisons and vague phylogenetic inferences, can lead to misconceptions about primate phylogeny and misunderstandings about primates from the Eocene, as seen with the media coverage of &quot;Darwinius&quot;. Because the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as &quot;primitive&quot; strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines. They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade. Although their status as true primates is not questioned, the questionable relationship between adapiforms and other living and fossil primates leads to multiple classifications within Strepsirrhini. Often, adapiforms are placed in their own infraorder due to anatomical differences with lemuriforms and their unclear relationship. When shared traits with lemuriforms (which may or may not be synapomorphic) are emphasized, they are sometimes reduced to families within the infraorder Lemuriformes (or superfamily Lemuroidea).

<text>The Fiat Punto is a supermini car (B-segment) produced by the Italian manufacturer Fiat from 1993 to 2018, spanning over three generations. The third generation of the car was marketed between 2005 and 2009 as the Grande Punto, and between 2009 and 2012 as the Punto Evo, until the single-word Punto name was reintroduced. , nearly nine million units had been sold globally.
Production of the first generation Punto was 3.429 million units, second generation 2.96 million units, and third generation 2.67 million units.


==First generation (176; 1993)==

Internally codenamed &quot;Project 176&quot;, the Punto was announced in September 1993, as a replacement for the aging Fiat Uno, and launched at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994, depending on the market. The Fiat Punto was voted European Car of the Year for 1995, defeating rival Volkswagen Polo by only 78 points. The Punto received a mild facelift in 1997.

The official launch of the Punto in the United Kingdom was in October 1993, at the London Motorfair.

The Punto was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, and originated as a 1990 design proposal for Renault&#x27;s project X57, which would become the Renault Clio. When Giugiaro&#x27;s proposal was not chosen, he took the design to Fiat, who accepted it. Giugiaro was awarded the Compasso d&#x27;Oro industrial design award in 1994. The Punto was available as a three-door or five-door hatchback, a two-door cabriolet and a three-door panel van. As the majority of the new Fiat group models, the suspension was all independent, composed of MacPherson struts at the front and trailing arms at the rear.

The entry-level engines in the Punto range were the 1.1 and 1.2 L petrol engines and the 1.7 diesel engine. The 1.2 engine&#x27;s actual capacity is 1242 cc, available in three versions. The first, was fitted in the Punto ELX 75 and produced at 6000 rpm while the second, fitted to Punto ELX 85 produced at 6000 rpm.

The third was a engine which eventually replaced the 1.1 engine.

===Sporting versions===
A Sporting model was also available with a 1.6 8v updated 128 SOHC engine, producing , later replaced in 1997 by the 1.2 16v FIRE engine used in the 85 ELX, and a power drop to .

===GT versions===

The top of the range model was the 1.4 GT, using an evolution of the turbocharged 128 SOHC engine originally found in the Fiat Uno Turbo Mk II, capable of running over and reaching in 7.9 seconds, and came fitted with a five speed manual gearbox.

During the years, the GT was made in three different &quot;series&quot;, producing (1993–1995), (1995–1997), and (1997–1999).

===Convertible===
A cabriolet (convertible) version was also available; built by Bertone (rather than at the main Fiat factory), it featured an electric-powered fully retracting roof and was one of the cheapest open-top cars in the world at the time. In Europe, the car was also made with a manual roof.

Available in both ELX and SX trim, initially powered by the 1.6 Mpi unit (replaced in 1995 by the 1.2 litre 16v unit FIRE). Approximately 55,000 cars were built between April 1994 and June 1999, although the last cars were registered in 2000.

===Other versions===
Particular versions of the first generation Punto were the Punto 6Speed, a 1.1 FIRE Punto 55 with a six-speed gearbox, the Punto Selecta with a CVT type automatic gearbox, and the Punto ED (Economical Drive), a 1.1 Punto whose five-speed gearbox was designed for high fuel efficiency.

===Punto Grama 2 Maggiora===
Maggiora created the Punto Grama 2 by using Lancia Dedra integrale underpinnings.

===Engines===
==Second generation (188; 1999)==


The second generation Punto codenamed &quot;Project 188&quot;, was launched in September 1999 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The styling was all-new while retaining the original Punto&#x27;s distinctive shape and design, while the chassis and interior were completely overhauled, with a new torsion beam rear suspension.

The new Punto also became the first Fiat in decades to carry the original round Fiat badge to celebrate Fiat&#x27;s centenary.

At the launch event of the hatchback, the Fiat Wish concept car was also presented, which was hardtop convertible version of the Fiat Punto, very similar in styling with the Peugeot 206 CC. The model was conceived by Pininfarina to celebrate the centenary of Fiat.

===Entry level===
The 1.1 and 1.4 engines were discontinued due to emissions issues and the entry-level models had only a 1.2 petrol unit, with either 8 or 16 valves, giving and respectively, or a 1.9L diesel, with common rail injection and turbocharger or naturally aspired with mechanical injection.

===Sporting versions===

Two sporty versions were offered. The 1.2 16 valve Sporting model with a six-speed manual, and the 1.8 HGT which could reach almost . The 1.2 16V model also has a Speedgear CVT equipped variant (with a sequential manual shift mode consisting of six gears, seven for the Sporting model).

The 1.8 HGT accelerates from 0 to 60 in 8.6 seconds. It was considered a big improvement in handling over the Punto GT. The HGT was also available (in limited numbers) as an &quot;HGT Abarth&quot; which added deeper bumpers, rear spoiler, side skirts, new alloy wheels, and interior trim. The HGT Abarth had no technical improvements over the regular HGT.

===Power steering===
The second generation Punto has also adopted the Dualdrive electric power steering and came with two operation modes, using an electric motor, rather than a hydraulic pump driven by the engine.

This resulted in reduced fuel consumption and less environmental impact. It has a fuel economy of , urban and , extra urban for the 1.9 diesel. The 1.8 petrol does , urban and , extra urban.

===Facelift===
At the beginning of 2003, Fiat celebrated the rollout of the 5,000,000th production Punto. During the same year, the second generation facelift brought further revisions to the platform, including extensive changes to the exterior styling and engines, partly due to changes in pedestrian safety regulations.

The round Fiat badge, found only on the bonnet of second-generation models, was introduced on the tailgate of the second generation facelift. On 1 June 2005, Fiat produced the 6,000,000th Punto at the Melfi plant.

Engine changes included a new 1.4 L 16v engine, alongside the staple 1.2 and 1.2 L 16v variants, and the introduction of two HGT versions, the 1.9 L MultiJet diesel engine and the 1.8 L 16v petrol engine, which could reach almost continued over from the pre-facelift version. There was an introduction also of the 1.3 L common rail diesel MultiJet engine.

====Punto Classic====
Despite the launch of the slightly larger Grande Punto at the end of 2005, the second generation Punto remained in production, marketed as the Punto Classic, and has been sold in many markets in addition to the newer versions. It was launched for the first time in Chile in 2007. It ended production in Italy in November 2010.

====Zastava 10====
In October 2005, Serbian automotive manufacturer Zastava reached an agreement with Fiat to assemble this version under licence in Kragujevac, Serbia, with the model name Zastava 10. After acquiring a majority stake in Zastava in the autumn of 2008, Fiat continued production of this vehicle under the Fiat Punto Classic name from March 2009.

Production was stopped in middle of 2011, and restarted in 2013, albeit very briefly. It has been available with the 1.2 litre petrol engine and later, also with the 1.3 litre diesel engine, the version of 2013 featured a newer, more modern engine.

===Trim levels===
The Punto was initially released in four different trim levels: &quot;S&quot;, &quot;SX&quot;, &quot;ELX&quot; and &quot;HLX&quot;, that were later renamed to &quot;Actual&quot;, &quot;Active&quot;, &quot;Dynamic&quot; and &quot;Emotion&quot;. Three special versions of the three door hatchback were also available: &quot;Sporting&quot;, &quot;HGT&quot; and &quot;Abarth&quot;. The &#x27;Sporting&#x27; had a six speed manual gearbox as standard.

The top-level included such features as ABS, front and side airbags, window bags, remote central locking, front power windows, electrical power steering, air conditioning, a trip computer with four functions, CD player, CD changer, alloy rims and fog lamps. Options such as navigation and burglar alarm were also offered.

After the facelift, it also received EBD, ESP with ASR and hill holder, climate control with double zone heating, heated seats, MP3 player and subwoofer (HGT only), rear parking sensors and cruise control as an option. A revised instrument panel with a larger display could now show the instant consumption too.

===Engines===
Four petrol engines with multi-point injection system were available, as well as one indirect injection diesel and three common rail turbocharged diesel engines with intercooler (JTD and MultiJet). The 1.8 16v and the 1.9 MultiJet engines were available only with the three-door version in the HGT trim level.

==Third generation (199; 2005)==
The Grande Punto, codenamed &quot;Project 199&quot;, was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show and went on sale later on that year. Again styled by Giugiaro, the car is based on the Fiat Small platform developed in joint venture with Opel-General Motors.

Whilst the model shares some of its name with the previous Punto, a large number of its components are new, including a new chassis and body shell.

The engines are the Fiat 1.2 8v Fire (65 PS), a new 1.4 8v Fire (77 PS) and the 1.4 16v StarJet (95 PS). Four MultiJet diesel engines are also available: two 1.3 16v units ( and , the latter with a variable geometry turbocharger) and two 1.9 with and , all of them with diesel particulate filter. The 1.9 diesel was replaced with the new 1.6 MultiJet starting the end of 2008.

All the engines are Euro IV compliant. In 2007, a new 1.4 16v T-Jet turbocharged petrol engine, , became available. At the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show, Fiat introduced an Abarth version by Abarth &amp; C S.p.A. It was branded as an Abarth rather than Fiat.

The car&#x27;s nose, headlights and front grille look reminiscent of the Maserati Coupé (both were designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign).

===Other markets===
In Australia, Fiat introduced the Grande Punto in July 2006, sold only as the Punto; it was the first Fiat to be sold in Australia since 1989. In 2009, the Punto was discontinued in Australia, due to slow sales. The car was reintroduced in 2013 after Fiat began factory distribution in Australia, the car was repriced at a much lower price, that was more in keeping with its rivals. In September 2015, the Punto was once again pulled from the Australian market due to slow sales.

It was launched in Mexico in November 2006. The Grande Punto is placed above the Fiat Palio in the Mexican Fiat car lineup. Initially it was sold with the 1.4 16v StarJet engine with six speed manual gearbox in five door Dynamic and three door Sport trims. In December 2007, the 1.4 16v T-Jet variant was launched.

The Italian made Grande Punto was launched in Chile and the Dominican Republic in petrol and diesel versions. The Grande Punto also went on sale in South Africa in 2006, replacing the previous generation.

In the rest of South America, the Brazilian built Grande Punto (called only Punto) was launched in August 2007. Codenamed &quot;Project 310&quot;, it is produced in the factory of Betim, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The chassis is an adaptation of the Fiat Palio, a lower cost compact. Levels of safety were not maintained (airbags and ABS are optional on lower trim levels, and the highest one has only two airbags as standard), but the ride comfort is said to be the same.

The five door version was the only one available in the Brazilian line, and there were no plans for a two-door version (in Brazil, two door vehicles are only accepted for cheaper cars). The engines available at launch were the 1.4 Fire 8v and the 1.8 Ecotec-Family 1 X18XE engine that comes from GM-Fiat/Powertrain, and later the 1.4 Fire 16v TurboJet, also available for the Linea.

For the model of 2011, there were added the new E.TorQ engines 1.6 16v and 1.8 16v. Produced by Fiat Powertrain Technologies, they were based on the discontinued Tritec engines. All non Turbo petrol models produced in Brazil are flex-fuel.

The Grande Punto was launched in India during the Delhi Auto Expo in January 2008, with sales starting in June 2009. The Punto for the Indian market was manufactured by the Fiat / Tata Motors joint venture Fiat India Automobiles Ltd (FIAL) in a new plant in Ranjangaon, Maharashtra and based on the same 310 project of the Brazilian Punto.

A related sedan car, the Fiat Linea, was launched in the beginning of 2007 to replace the ageing Fiat Marea. It is built on an extended version of the Grande Punto&#x27;s chassis, with a total length of , making it part of the superior small family car segment.

===Safety===
The Grande Punto was awarded with five stars in the Euro NCAP crash test for passenger protection, and three stars certification for pedestrian safety. The most powerful engines have electronic stability program and anti slip regulation fitted as standard, and it is an optional extra on some of the lower powered engines.

However, in a later test in December 2017, the car was retested with a zero star rating by Euro NCAP. It scored 51% for its protection of adult occupants, with chest protection for the rear passenger deemed weak and whiplash protection for the front passengers deemed poor. It scored 43% for its protection of child occupants, doing better at protecting the dummy representing an analogue of a six-year-old child than it did at protecting the dummy representing an analogue of a ten-year-old child and with the organisation noting that it was unclear whether or not the front-passenger airbag was activated. It scored 52% for pedestrian protection, mostly doing badly at protecting a struck pedestrian&#x27;s head but generally doing well at protecting their legs and pelvis. It scored 0% for safety assist features, with the organisation noting that an unplugged-seatbelt warning was only standard equipment for the driver&#x27;s seat. One of the given reasons for this is the fact that the third generation Punto was launched in 2005, making the car a twelve year old model, whose safety standards were never actually updated.

===Abarth Grande Punto (2007–2010)===
The first car from the newly created (2007) Fiat owned Abarth &amp; C. S.p.A., the Abarth Grande Punto differs significantly from its donor car.

Initially the Abarth Grande Punto was released with a 150 PS (155 PS when using 97 RON fuel) 1.4 turbo engine, but from 2008, there was available an Essesse kit, which could be installed at official Abarth service centres rather than in the factory. Amongst various refinements included uprated brakes and suspension, the Essesse kit provided an uprated power output of .

===2009 facelift (Punto Evo)===
The Punto Evo, a facelift version of the Grande Punto, was presented in September 2009 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It received a new front end, in addition to revised rear lights, and a new interior. It has two new engines, a 1.3 L second generation Multijet diesel and a 1.4 L petrol engine with the MultiAir technology. It also features a new navigation system integrated to the Blue&amp;Me system called Blue&amp;Me–TomTom.

====Abarth Punto Evo (2010–2015)====
The Abarth Punto Evo was shown at 2010 Geneva Motor Show. It has a MultiAir Turbo inline-four engine. The top speed is and acceleration from 0 to takes 7.5 seconds.

A new Esseesse version was released in 2011, which was an optional upgrade that improved performance, with a 0– time of 7.3 seconds. The Abarth Punto Evo was discontinued in 2015, after slow sales.

===2012 facelift===
Fiat introduced the 2012 Punto in September 2011 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, as a facelifted version of the Punto Evo that reintroduced the Punto nomenclature (without &quot;Grande&quot; or &quot;Evo&quot;). The facelift was consisted of slighter tweaks than changing from Grande Punto to Punto Evo, keeping the revised rear lights and interior of the 2009 Punto Evo, but not on the base &#x27;Pop&#x27; trim level which reverted to the older Grande Punto interior.

In October 2014, &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; placed the Punto Pop 1.2 liter 8v 69 on its list of &quot;The Worst Cars You Can Buy Right Now&quot;, describing the car as &quot;An outclassed elderly supermini that kicks out 126 g/km yet takes 14.4 secs to wheeze to 62 mph, and it costs more than £10k.&quot;

Production of the three-door version ended in 2015, leaving only the five-door version available in Europe.

In June 2016, Fiat introduced the new &quot;Techno Pack&quot; with the 5-inch touchscreen infotainment system and cruise control. Production of the Punto ended on 7 August 2018, with no direct successor being announced. However, it continued to be produced in India for an additional three months before production ended in November of that year.

=== 2014 Indian facelift (Punto Evo) ===
Fiat India gave the Punto Evo an extensive and exclusive facelift in August 2014. The facelift consisted of large, swept back headlamps, a new grille and chrome inserts, whilst the rear of the car received LED taillamps from its European twin, and the dashboard from the European car. This car also sports an SUV like ground clearance of 185mm for diesel and 195mm for petrol to suit Indian roads. In August 2015, Fiat launched in India the Abarth brand, imported from Poland the Abarth 595 Competizione and the locally produced Abarth Punto, based on the 310-Punto five door.

Indian Abarth Punto come with a 1.4 Turbojet engine with and new sport kit for exterior and interior including revised Abarth badge and retuned chassis. Transmission is a five speed manual.

Fiat India launched a crossover version of the Punto Evo called Avventura in India in October 2014. The Avventura was aimed at the market inhabited by the likes of Toyota Etios Cross, Volkswagen CrossPolo and Ford EcoSport.

Production in India ended in November 2018, together with the Abarth and Adventure versions. As a result, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles decided to withdraw the Fiat brand from the Indian market, leaving space to the brand of Jeep.
===Punto Van===
The Punto Van is a compact van designed for the commercial market. It features a petrol 1.2 8v engine, a petrol/CNG 1.2 8v engine, and a diesel 1.3 MultiJet 16v engine.

==Motorsport==

The Punto has always been popular with amateur racing drivers due to its low cost and the wide availability of spare parts. Numerous competition and homologated versions of the Punto have been produced, such as the Punto Rally, the S1600, and the Punto Abarth.

A new rally car based on the third generation Punto, the Super 2000 Punto Abarth, was unveiled in 2005. It is four-wheel drive and powered by a 2.0 L 16 valve engine capable of producing . Also, a turbodiesel front wheel drive rally car has been produced, the Fiat Grande Punto R3D.

The Punto has won several rally championships, specifically:
* Italian Rally Championship (2003 and 2006)
* European Rally Championship (2006)
* 2006 International Rally Challenge season

<text>George Maxwell Richards (1 December 1931 – 8 January 2018) was a Trinidadian politician who served as the fourth president of Trinidad and Tobago, in office from 2003 to 2013. He was the first president of Trinidad and Tobago and head of state in the Anglophone Caribbean to have Amerindian ancestry.

A chemical engineer by training, Richards was Principal of the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies in Trinidad from 1984 to 1996. He previously worked for Shell Trinidad Ltd before joining the University of the West Indies in 1965. He was sworn into office as president on 17 March 2003 for a five-year term.

==Early life and education==
Richards was born at his family&#x27;s home in San Fernando in South Trinidad in 1931 as one of five children in the family. He was of Amerindian and Chinese descent. His father, George Richards, was a barrister while his mother, Henrietta Martin was a housewife and teacher. He received his primary education there before winning an exhibition (scholarship) to attend Queen&#x27;s Royal College in Port of Spain. From May 1950 to September 1951, he worked for the United British Oilfields of Trinidad (precursor to Shell Trinidad Ltd.) at Point Fortin. He received a scholarship from them to study chemical engineering.

Richards then attended the University of Manchester (UMIST), where he took a BEng degree (1955) and an MEng degree (1957). He subsequently obtained a PhD degree in chemical engineering from the University of Cambridge (Pembroke).

==Early career==
Richards returned to Trinidad and worked for Shell Trinidad Ltd from 1957 to 1965 before joining the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of the West Indies, eventually attaining the post of Professor of Chemical Engineering in October 1970. From August 1980 to May 1985, Richards served as Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Deputy Principal of the University. He served as Acting Principal of the St. Augustine Campus from October 1984 to May 1985, and was confirmed in the position in 1985.

Richards served as Principal through the turbulent period in 1988 when the government slashed the university&#x27;s budget by 30% and instituted a cess on university students (effectively raising tuition from TT$120 to $3000 overnight).

Richards managed to keep the university afloat through this difficult period and retired as Principal in November 1996 although he continued to teach as professor emeritus until he was elected president. Richards also served on the Boards of many Trinidad and Tobago companies including that of the state-owned oil company, Trintoc (now Petrotrin), the National Gas Company and the Trinidad Publishing Company.

==Presidency==
Although the position of president is a primarily ceremonial one, Richards had been outspoken in his criticism of the upsurge of crime in Trinidad and Tobago. He was also well known for his involvement in Carnival. He was the first President of the Republic who was not an attorney.

Richards was re-elected to a second five-year term as president by the Electoral College on 11 February 2008. He was the only candidate, and the Electoral College met for only three minutes.

In May 2009, Richards faced calls to resign for bungling the appointment of the Trinidad and Tobago Integrity Commission, whose members all resigned for various reasons within a week of being sworn in on 1 May 2009, even as Richards embarked on a three-week foreign vacation. In a televised address to the nation on 29 May 2009, he said he had not brought his office into disrepute and so saw no reason to resign. He remained in office until 2013.

==Other activities==
Richards also served on the board of the Trinidad Publishing Company, TRINTOC, and the National Gas Company. He also served on the boards of several service organizations such as Chairman of both the National Training Board and National Advisory Council and the Institute of Marine Affairs.

==Personal life and death==
He was married to Jean Ramjohn, an anesthesiologist and cousin of the former President Noor Hassanali. They had two children: a son, Mark, who is also a medical doctor; and a daughter, Maxine, who is a businesswoman.

Richards died at WestShore Medical Private Hospital in Port of Spain at around 7.43pm, on 8 January 2018 of heart failure at the age of 86.

His ashes were scattered over the seas of the Gulf of Paria on the night of January 19th, 2018 and the Richards family said their final farewell to their husband, father, brother, and uncle as well as the nation&#x27;s fourth president.

==Honors==
In 1977, Richards received the Chaconia Medal of the National Order of the Trinity, Class 1 Gold (the &quot;Chaconia Medal, Gold&quot;) for his contributions to Trinidad and Tobago.

Richards also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2007.

<doc id="750496" wikidata="Q2150690" url="?curid=750496" title="Richard Stilgoe">
<text>Sir Richard Henry Simpson Stilgoe (born 28 March 1943) is a British songwriter, lyricist and musician, and broadcaster who is best known for his humorous songs and frequent television appearances. His output includes collaborations with Andrew Lloyd Webber and Peter Skellern. He is also a keen puzzler who has hosted several quiz shows and written several books on the subject.

Stilgoe is also notable for his charity work and fundraising. In the 1980s, he founded the Alchemy Foundation which is funded from his royalties from the American productions of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. He is patron of the Surrey Care Trust in Woking. In the late 1990s he founded the Orpheus Centre which offers performing arts experiences to young people with disabilities. In 2012, Stilgoe was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for his extensive charity work.

==Early life==
Stilgoe was born in Camberley, Surrey, on 28 March 1943. He was brought up in Liverpool, where, as lead singer of a group called &#x27;Tony Snow and the Blizzards&#x27;, he performed at the Cavern Club. He was educated at Liverpool College, Monkton Combe School in Somerset and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Cambridge University Footlights.

==Career==
In 1966, Stilgoe played Benjamin in the West End musical, &quot;Jorrocks&quot;. He made his name on the BBC television teatime programme, &quot;Nationwide&quot;, followed by Esther Rantzen&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;, a light-hearted consumer affairs programme for which he wrote comic songs satirising minor domestic misfortunes, often to the tune of &quot;Oh! Mr Porter&quot;. One notable song concerned officials who have &quot;Statutory Right of Entry to your Home&quot;, with Stilgoe playing and singing, in barber-shop style, all parts himself using trick photography. 

His ability to write a song from almost any source material and at speed is part of his cabaret act, which includes singing the instructions from a Swedish payphone; a pastiche of the King&#x27;s Singers listing the kings and queens of England in which he sings all four parts; and composing a song in the interval from words and musical notes called out by the audience. He has also written and presented BBC radio programmes, including &quot;Hamburger Weekend&quot;, &quot;Used Notes&quot;, &quot;Stilgoe&#x27;s Around&quot;, &quot;Maestro&quot; and &quot;Richard Stilgoe&#x27;s Traffic Jam Show&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

In 1979, the BBC aired &quot;Decision &#x27;79 Breakfast Special&quot; as part of its coverage of the parliamentary elections that brought Margaret Thatcher to power; the show featured Stilgoe singing the election results. In 1981, Southern Television commissioned him to write a satirical song about the company that outbid them for southern England&#x27;s ITV franchise, Television South; the result was &quot;Portakabin TV&quot;, a reference to the portable buildings TVS was forced to use as studios and offices until its own purpose-built complex in Maidstone, Kent could be completed and until Southern&#x27;s contract expired. The song was aired as part of Southern&#x27;s final broadcast on 31 December 1981, a retrospective programme titled &quot;And It&#x27;s Goodbye From Us&quot;.

In 1980, he wrote two Christmas songs, &quot;Christmas Bells&quot; and &quot;Imitation Myrrh&quot;, which he sang with Broom Leys Junior School choir, from Coalville, Leicestershire. The songs were sold as a record at Christmas throughout Leicestershire to raise money for the Leicestershire Arts and Music Association. These two, with other Christmas pieces of his composition, also appeared in &quot;The Truth about Christmas – or Gold, Frankenstein and Merv&quot; – a one-off television programme in 1984, performed by Stilgoe and children from the Broom Leys Junior School Choir.

Stilgoe is a fan of anagrams and in 1980 he wrote &quot;The Richard Stilgoe Letters; a Jumble of Anagrams&quot;, using characters made of anagrams of his own name. These included Chris Dogtailer and Giscard O&#x27;Hitler. He has appeared over 200 times on the daytime TV quiz show, &quot;Countdown&quot;, and hosted quiz shows such as &quot;The Year in Question&quot; on Radio 4, &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; (1981–1985), and &quot;Scoop&quot; (1981–1982). His 45-minute poem, &quot;Who Pays the Piper?&quot;, outlined the history of music from Pan to the modern day, interspersing classical music with re-written lyrics. He also appeared on a satirical BBC TV show of the 1980s, &quot;A Kick Up the Eighties&quot;.

Stilgoe wrote lyrics for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, and collaborated with Charles Hart on the lyrics to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. He also wrote two musicals for schools, &quot;Bodywork&quot; and &quot;Brilliant the Dinosaur&quot;. He has appeared on the Royal Variety Performance, presented the Schools Proms for over 20 years and toured solo and with Peter Skellern.

Throughout the 1980s, Stilgoe hosted the BBC 2 fitness programme &quot;Looking Good, Feeling Fit&quot;.

==Charitable work==
In 1984, Stilgoe founded the Alchemy Foundation, which distributes money to good causes. The foundation is funded from Stilgoe&#x27;s royalties from American productions of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. Before The Alchemy Foundation, Stilgoe gave all his royalties as lyricist on &quot;Starlight Express&quot; to a village in India. Such was the musical&#x27;s success that for some years these were exceeding £500 a day. 

Stilgoe founded the Orpheus Centre in 1998, in his former family home in Godstone, Surrey, offering performing arts experiences to young people with disabilities; he also started the Stilgoe Family Concerts series at the Royal Festival Hall, which feature young performers and regular commissions of new music.

He is President of the Surrey Care Trust in Woking, Surrey, which provides education, training, skills and volunteering opportunities to those who need motivation or a second chance in life. The charity also runs a fund to help those facing hardship throughout Surrey.

==Personal life==
Stilgoe has five children: a son and daughter with his first wife Lizzie, and two sons and a daughter with his second wife, Annabel, including musician Joe Stilgoe.

He was High Sheriff of Surrey in 1998–99, and is a Deputy Lieutenant. He became president of Surrey County Cricket Club in 2005. He has also been president of the Lord&#x27;s Taverners.

He owns Winifred Atwell&#x27;s &quot;other&quot; piano, the one which she used for her honky-tonk performances and recordings.

==Awards and honours==
Stilgoe has two Tony nominations, three Monte Carlo Prizes, and a Prix Italia. He has honorary doctorates from the Universities of Greenwich, Southampton and Surrey, is an honorary Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University, an honorary Associate of the Royal Academy of Music, and an Honorary Member of the Royal College of Music. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1998 Birthday Honours, &quot;for services to the community,
especially Disabled People.&quot;

Stilgoe was knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for charitable services through the Alchemy Foundation.

<doc id="750499" wikidata="Q1500314" url="?curid=750499" title="Battle of Harran">
<text>The Battle of Harran took place on 7 May 1104 between the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch and the County of Edessa, and the Seljuk Turks. It was the first major battle against the newfound Crusader states in the aftermath of the First Crusade, marking a key turning point against Frankish expansion. The battle had a disastrous effect on the Principality of Antioch as the Turks regained territory earlier lost.

==Background==
In 1104 Baldwin II of Edessa had attacked and besieged the city of Harran. For his further support Baldwin sought help from Bohemond I of Antioch and Tancred, Prince of Galilee. Bohemond and Tancred marched north from Antioch to Edessa to join with Baldwin and Joscelin of Courtenay, accompanied by Bernard of Valence the Patriarch of Antioch, Daimbert of Pisa the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Benedict, the Archbishop of Edessa. 

The Seljuks, under Jikirmish, governor of Mosul, and Sokman, the Artuqid lord of Mardin, gathered in the area of the Khabur, perhaps at Ras al-Ayn (Hellenistic Rhesaina). In May 1104 they attacked Edessa, perhaps to distract the crusaders from Harran, perhaps to take the city while the crusaders were elsewhere engaged.

==Battle==
According to Ibn al-Qalanisi, Tancred and Bohemund arrived at Edessa during the siege, but according to &quot;Chronicle of 1234&quot; they arrived first at the gates of Harran. In any case, the Seljuks rode away from the crusaders, feigning a retreat and the crusaders followed.

The Seljuks feigned retreat in the preliminary skirmishes while the Crusaders continued their pursuit south. The contemporary chronicler Matthew of Edessa reports a pursuit of two days while Ralph of Caen reports three days. According to Ibn al-Athir, the main battle was fought twelve kilometres from Harran.

Most historians accept the accounts of Albert of Aachen and Fulcher of Chartres, who located the battle on the plain (&quot;planitie&quot;) opposite the city of Raqqa, Raqqa being about two days away from Harran. 

Baldwin and Joscelin commanded the Edessan left wing while Bohemond and Tancred commanded the Antiochene right. Ralph of Caen says that the crusaders were caught unawares when the Seljuks turned to fight, so much so that Baldwin and Bohemond fought without armor. 

During the battle itself, Baldwin&#x27;s troops were completely routed, with Baldwin and Joscelin captured by the Turks. The Antiochene troops along with Bohemond were able to escape to Edessa. However, Jikirmish had only taken a small amount of booty, so he purloined Baldwin from Sokman&#x27;s camp. Although a ransom was paid, Joscelin and Baldwin were not released until sometime before 1108, and 1109 respectively.

==Significance==
The battle was one of the first decisive Crusader defeats with severe consequences to the Principality of Antioch. The Byzantine Empire took advantage of the defeat to impose their claims on Antioch, and recaptured Latakia and parts of Cilicia. Many of the towns ruled by Antioch revolted and were re-occupied by Muslim forces from Aleppo. Armenian territories also revolted in favour of the Byzantines or Armenia. Furthermore, these events caused Bohemund to return to Italy to recruit more troops, leaving Tancred as regent of Antioch.

William of Tyre wrote that there was no battle more disastrous than this. Although Antioch recovered by the next year, the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus imposed the Treaty of Devol on Bohemond, which would have made Antioch a vassal of the empire had Tancred agreed to it. Antioch was again crushed at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis in 1119. Edessa never really recovered and survived until 1144 but only because of divisions among the Muslims.

<text>Kin Herbert Shriner (born December 6, 1953) is an American actor, best known for his portrayal of Scott Baldwin on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;Port Charles&quot;.

==Early life==
Shriner and his twin brother, actor Wil Shriner, were born in New York City to Pixie ( Eileen McDermott) and Herb Shriner. His father was a popular television personality. The brothers were orphaned when their parents died in an automobile accident when the twins were teenagers. After, the brothers moved to Texas to live with their grandmother. He also has a sister, Indy Shriner, an actress best known for &#x27;Reefer Madness II&#x27;.

==Career==
Shriner was employed by Fuller Brush as a door-to-door salesman before becoming an actor. He was originally cast as Scott Baldwin on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, the role he is best known for playing, in 1977. In the fall of 1980, he left &quot;General Hospital&quot; and immediately began playing Jeb Hampton on the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Texas&quot;. He left that role in 1981 and soon returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, where he remained until 1983, returning again from 1987-1993. In between those stints, he appeared on the short-lived syndicated daily soap &quot;Rituals&quot; as hero Mike Gallagher. He also played Dr. Brian Carey on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; from 1994 to 1995.

In 1997, he once again returned to playing Scott Baldwin, but this time on &quot;General Hospital&quot;″s spin-off &quot;Port Charles&quot;. &quot;Port Charles&quot; was set in the same fictional city as &quot;General Hospital&quot; – Port Charles, New York – and featured many of the same characters. In 2000, Shriner returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; and quit appearing on &quot;Port Charles&quot; the next year. He left &quot;General Hospital&quot; again in 2004, and in that year portrayed Harrison Bartlett on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

In 2005, he joined the cast of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in the role of Keith Morrissey until leaving the show in 2006. He returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 2007 and left the series again in 2008. In 2013, he returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, where he has remained since. Additionally, in 2011, he served as a temporary fill-in for fellow actor Ted Shackelford on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, portraying Jeffrey Bardwell until September 2011.

Outside of soap operas, Shriner has appeared on several primetime television programs, playing temporary roles beginning in 1976. In later years he guest starred on several programs such as ABC&#x27;s top 10 sitcom &quot;Full House&quot;.

===&quot;General Hospital&quot;===
Shriner is best known for playing Scott Baldwin on &quot;General Hospital&quot; over all other roles he has played. He was first cast as the character in 1977. He has left the program several times to play different roles on other soap operas, for short periods of time, but continues to appear as a regular cast member on &quot;General Hospital

===&quot;Port Charles&quot;===
Plans to spin off &quot;General Hospital&quot; were announced in December 1996. ABC had previously passed on the idea of a &quot;GH&quot; spin-off proposed by former head writer Claire Labine. Tentatively titled &quot;GH2&quot;, the series was set to revolve around interns at the medical school across from General Hospital. Wendy Riche, executive producer of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, was hired to fill the same role for the new series. Riche said of the new show, &quot;This will be a multigenerational show, which is the kind of drama we&#x27;ve always done at &quot;GH&quot;&quot;. It was later announced that the series would be titled &quot;Port Charles&quot;, after the fictional city where the series are set, and it would star Jon Lindstrom and Lynn Herring, playing their roles from &quot;GH&quot;.

The series premiered with a two-hour prime time special that aired on June 1, 1997. It started in its regular timeslot, the following day, replacing the canceled &quot;The City&quot;. The series also featured the return of &quot;General Hospital&quot; characters Scott Baldwin (Kin Shriner), Gail Baldwin (Susan Brown), Lee Baldwin (Peter Hansen) and Karen Wexler (Jennifer Hammon). After the series premiered, it was unclear if Lindstrom, Herring, and Shriner would remain with the series. It was later confirmed the actors would stay on the show.

<doc id="750503" wikidata="Q5336821" url="?curid=750503" title="Eden Capwell and Cruz Castillo">
<text>Eden Capwell and Cruz Castillo are fictional characters and a supercouple from the American daytime drama &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. Eden was portrayed by American actress Marcy Walker from September 28, 1984 to August 9, 1991, and Cruz was portrayed by actor A Martinez from August 13, 1984 to September 11, 1992. While producers were at first unsure about pairing the blonde, white Eden with a character of Mexican descent, the fans eagerly adopted the new couple, and they quickly became &quot;Santa Barbara&#x27;s&quot; most popular couple.

==Storyline==
This couple&#x27;s subsequent relationship was not apparent when their characters first appeared. (Eden, having been away from Santa Barbara for some time, made a dramatic entrance by parachuting onto the grounds of the Capwell estate.) As a matter of fact, Cruz and Eden did not seem to like each other very much in their early scenes from 1984. Not only were their differing ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds a strong factor in their initial dislike, but Eden and Cruz were attracted to other characters on the show. During this period, Cruz was pursuing his childhood friend, Santana Andrade, while Eden was showing interest in Lionel Lockridge.

However, Marcy Walker and A Martinez have been quoted as saying that they pushed the Eden and Cruz angle, as it was not part of the original writer&#x27;s plans to pair the two. Eventually the actors won out and Santa Barbara&#x27;s first supercouple was born. By mid-1985, only a year after the debut of the show, Eden and Cruz were fan favorites and a great deal of the viewers were rooting for this couple. The racial issues were touched upon very intelligently by the writers, acknowledged, yet not ridiculed.

As Cruz and Eden began dating during this period, their differing ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, became major hurdles in their relationship. Both Eden&#x27;s father, C.C. Capwell and Cruz&#x27;s mother, Carmen, did not approve of the relationship for these reasons. Despite this, Cruz and Eden continued with their relationship and were soon engaged. However, as with any supercouple, more problems ensued that jeopardized the relationship. One involved the investigation into Channing&#x27;s murder (Eden&#x27;s older brother).

Cruz, who was a detective on the Santa Barbara Police Force at the time, re-opened the case when new evidence on other possible suspects appeared. This caused a great deal of tension in the relationship since Cruz often found himself struggling between his duty as a police officer and his loyalty to Eden. The loyalty was challenged when the murder investigation leads to Eden&#x27;s mother, Sophia, as the prime suspect. However, Eden and Cruz were able to reconcile their differences and together, they worked to get Sophia (who killed Channing by accident) a lenient jail sentence.

Soon, Eden and Cruz became engaged and a wedding date was set. However, more events would postpone the wedding and damage the relationship. A fire at the Capwell Hotel stopped Cruz and Eden&#x27;s first attempt at marriage in 1985. Later on in the year, Eden&#x27;s father, C.C. suffered a stroke and slipped into a coma. Eden is thrust into the leadership position of the Capwell family (much to her older brother Mason&#x27;s chagrin). The future wedding is postponed even further when an ambitious business man, by the name of Kirk Cranston, comes to town. He helped Eden run the family business, but had a strong romantic interest in Eden as well.

 In late 1985, Cruz and Eden are torn even further apart when an attempt to kill Eden&#x27;s comatose father was made during their engagement party. Gina, the estranged current wife of C.C., devised an elaborate plan to unplug C.C&#x27;s life-support and frame Eden for the crime. The attempt on C.C.&#x27;s life was unsuccessful, but Gina&#x27;s attempt at casting suspicion on Eden paid off. Eden, who had been drugged by Gina on the day of the incident, could not be certain of her innocence and began distancing herself from Cruz, who was called to investigate. Kirk Cranston used this moment to befriend Eden. He offered to become Eden&#x27;s alibi. And shortly thereafter, he proposed marriage to Eden. Eden, feeling the pressure of an impending police investigation with her fiancé at the helm, agreed to marry Kirk. After a couple of months, Eden was cleared of any suspicion of her father&#x27;s attempt murder, but the damage to her relationship with Cruz had been done.

In 1986, after C.C. came out of his coma, Cruz, would also find himself in a loveless marriage to another person. He married Santana Andrade, a childhood family friend of the Castillo clan. He married Santana to help her obtain custody of her son, Brandon, and because Eden was pregnant with Kirk&#x27;s child. This was a ploy perpetuated by C.C. (who was the boy&#x27;s current legal custodian) to keep Cruz away from Eden. He felt that Cruz&#x27;s presence was a threat to Eden&#x27;s marriage to Kirk, which he endorsed. Later on in the year, Eden&#x27;s marriage to Kirk falls apart. Kirk, enraged with suspicious and jealousy of Eden&#x27;s lingering feelings for Cruz, made several attempts on her life. With Cruz&#x27;s help, Eden gets rid of Kirk, but not before he lures her to a shark aquarium for one last attempt on her life. After, the shootout and Eden&#x27;s escape from the aquarium, Kirk Cranston is presumed dead. However, he would reappear in later episodes to cause Cruz and Eden more torment.

Cruz&#x27;s marriage would end when Santana became addicted to cocaine. Gina got Santana hooked by switching her allergy medication for cocaine. Gina, who originally had custody of Brandon before C.C., did this as an attempt to get the child. During this time, Santana begins an illicit affair with the current District Attorney, Keith Timmons. Santana was eventually sent away to an insane asylum and the marriage ends in divorce. After a time Cruz and Eden were briefly reunited, until their love was tested, once again, by another blast from Cruz&#x27;s past, Victoria Lane. Cruz ended up fathering a child by Tori and while the couple were again separated they eventually reconciled again. Soon afterwards though, Eden was presumed dead in Utah, but she is in fact held captive by Cain and the evil, long lost Capwell daughter, Elena. Cruz mourned Eden, but eventually learned that she was still alive. Unfortunately Eden is paralyzed, but after many sorrow-filled scenes, the pair are reunited. Cruz is arrested for the murder of Elena, however, which begins more torment for the star-crossed pair. Eventually, it was discovered that Elena committed suicide, in which she was trained by Kirk. Despite teaching her how to die, Kirk was unable to do the same when faced police, and was taken into custody. Cruz was cleared, and the couple were married at the Pebble Creek Inn (Stonepine Estate in Carmel Valley, California was used to depict the Inn). In turn of the century costumes, the couple finally says &quot;I do&quot; in style and the wedding goes off without a hitch on April 1, 1988.

It is not happily ever after for the Castillos, though. Shortly after the wedding, a rapist is on the loose in Santa Barbara and Eden is one of his victims. The storyline was widely acclaimed, and Marcy Walker won a 1989 Daytime Emmy for her emotional performance. A Martinez was also hailed for his performances as Cruz struggled to forgive himself for not protecting his beloved Eden, while also trying to catch the rapist. It is not long after the rape that the Castillos discover that Eden is pregnant. On January 1, 1989 the couple has their first child, Adriana Castillo. This joyous event is overshadowed when the baby is stolen by the rapist, Eden&#x27;s obstetrician, Zach.

After Walker returns from maternity leave (she gave birth to son Taylor), she returns to Santa Barbara where Cruz and Eden search for their missing daughter. The search leaves them to the oft-visited site of Paris, France (Eden is often said to be there when Marcy Walker is off screen) where the pair are finally reunited with their bundle of joy. This Paris location filming marks another first, as the huge popularity of the show in France has made a French publication offer to help fund the production of the show filming overseas. (These episodes will never air in France on the French channel that carries the show, as it was canceled there prior to these episodes airing, but French fans were able to pick them up on satellite channels from Germany). Eden and Cruz return to Santa Barbara briefly, and then head to Mexico in search of Cruz&#x27;s father.

Finally back at home, another test lies on the horizon for our supercouple, as Robert Barr, played to perfection by Roscoe Born, has come to town and threatens to take over the Capwell family business. It turns out that Robert and Eden were once lovers and this walk down memory lane causes a huge strain on the marriage of Cruz and Eden. However, they do overcome this test as well, after many, many months of fighting and pain, at their wedding site in Pebble Creek. Finally together again, they do have some happiness for a while, if you forget that Cruz is &quot;kidnapped&quot; by a pasha hoping to take the powers of a talisman that Cruz is in possession of and a few other wrenches in the grand design.

It is when Marcy Walker leaves the show for primetime that the great love story of Cruz and Eden comes to an end. While the show could have chosen many ways to convey this, they chose to have Eden suffer from multiple personality disorder, and to leave town, only to return as an alter-ego and leave again. Her character of Eden is last seen falling from a cliff, although her alter-egos are seen after that. Again, A Martinez shines as Cruz grieves for his love once again. Eventually the story is given closure as divorce papers are received by Cruz and Cruz himself leaves town.

==Reception==
Kim Zimmer, who joined &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; as Jodie Walker in 1992, found that fan reaction to the couple was so strong that her pairing with Cruz was dismissed. She lamented, &quot;The thought of super couples never bothered me, but I&#x27;m having a problem with it now because Eden and Cruz were such a super couple that anyone else who comes on the show with designs on Cruz gets hate mail. I can&#x27;t stress how hard it is for me to read mail from people who have such tunnel vision about the Eden/Cruz thing that they won&#x27;t accept another woman in his life. With super couples, they don&#x27;t let that die.&quot;

<doc id="750506" wikidata="Q3751320" url="?curid=750506" title="Lauchlin Currie">
<text>Lauchlin Bernard Currie (8 October 1902 – 23 December 1993) was a Canadian economist best known for being President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s chief economic advisor during World War II. 

After Roosevelt&#x27;s death, he led the first World Bank survey mission to Colombia and eventually settled there for the rest of his life, becoming an economic advisor to the Colombian government. This permanent relocation was not entirely voluntarily, as the U.S. had refused to renew his passport in 1954. This refusal was ostensibly because he was married to a non-US citizen and residing abroad, but was possibly influenced by the fact Currie had been named as a Soviet spy by two Soviet defectors and in nine partially decrypted VENONA cables sent by Soviet agents. He was never charged with a crime related to espionage or security violations, and debate remains around if he knowingly collaborated with agents of the Soviet Union.

==Childhood and education==
Currie was born on 8 October 1902 in West Dublin, Nova Scotia, to Lauchlin Bernard Currie, an operator of a fleet of merchant ships, and Alice Eisenhauer Currie, a schoolteacher. After his father died in 1906, his family moved to nearby Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, where most of his schooling took place.

Currie had begun to demonstrate studious habits (like reading late into the night) by the time his family moved to Massachusetts, but he drove automobiles &quot;with his foot on the floor board&quot; for relaxation. He also attended school in California, where he had relatives.

From 1920-1922, Currie attended St. Francis Xavier University before transferring to the London School of Economics to study under Edwin Cannan, Hugh Dalton, Arthur Lyon Bowley, and Harold Laski. After graduating with a BSc in 1925, he enrolled at Harvard University to study under Allyn Abbott Young, who ironically left in 1927 for the LSE (then died from influenza in 1928). Young remained an influence, however, and Currie&#x27;s final paper—on Youngian endogenous growth theory—was posthumously published in 1997. Currie graduated with a PhD in 1931, and his dissertation on banking theory was supervised by John H. Williams.

==Harvard==
Currie remained at Harvard until 1934 as a teaching assistant to John H. Williams, Ralph George Hawtrey, and Joseph Schumpeter, and one of his students was Paul Sweezy.

In a January 1932 memorandum on anti-Depression policy, Currie and fellow instructors Harry Dexter White and Paul Theodore Ellsworth urged large fiscal deficits coupled with open market operations to expand bank reserves, as well as the lifting of tariffs and the relief of interallied debts.

In 1934, Currie constructed the first money supply and income velocity series for the United States. He blamed the government&#x27;s &quot;commercial loan theory&quot; of banking for monetary tightening in mid-1929, when the economy was already declining, and then for its passivity during the next four years in the face of mass liquidations and bank failures. Instead, he advocated control of the money supply to stabilize income and expenditures. He cited his colleague and covert Soviet agent Abraham George Silverman for his &quot;many helpful suggestions and criticisms&quot; in the formation of this line of thinking.

==Federal Reserve==
In 1934, Currie became a naturalized U.S. citizen and joined Jacob Viner&#x27;s &quot;freshman brain trust&quot; at the Treasury Department, where he outlined an ideal monetary system for the U.S. that included a 100-percent reserve banking plan to strengthen central bank control and prevent bank panics in the future by preventing member banks from lending out their demand deposit liabilities, while removing reserve requirements on savings deposits with low turnover. Later that year, Marriner S. Eccles left the Treasury to become Chair of the Federal Reserve and took Currie with him as his personal assistant. Harry White was another &quot;freshman brain trust&quot; recruit who became a top advisor to Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., and White and Currie worked closely in their respective roles for some years after.

In his role as Deputy Director of the Department of Investigation, Currie drafted what became the Banking Act of 1935, which reorganized the Federal Reserve and strengthened its powers. He also constructed a &quot;net federal income-creating expenditure series&quot; to show the strategic role of fiscal policy in complementing monetary policy to revive an economy in exceptionally acute, persisting depression. Currie&#x27;s preferred 100-percent reserve banking idea, however, was not one of the reforms implemented. Alan Meltzer wrote in his history of the Federal Reserve that &quot;Lauchlin Currie wrote a remarkable memo for a Treasury committee in 1934 emphasizing the role of money in cyclical fluctuations, at a time when virtually no one thought that money mattered.&quot;

In 1937, the economy declined sharply after four years of recovery. In a four-hour interview with President Roosevelt, Currie was able to explain that the declared aim of balancing the budget &quot;to restore business confidence&quot; had damaged the economy. This was part of the &quot;struggle for the soul of FDR&quot; between the cautious Morgenthau and the expansionist Eccles. In April 1938, President Roosevelt asked Congress for major appropriations for spending on relief and public works. In May 1939, the rationale was explained in theoretical and statistical detail by Currie (&quot;Mr. Inside&quot;) and by Harvard&#x27;s Alvin Hansen (&quot;Mr. Outside&quot;) in testimony before the Temporary National Economic Committee to highlight the role of government deficits in the recovery process.

==White House==
Currie was appointed special advisor on economic affairs to the White House in July 1939 and gave counsel on taxation, social security, and the speeding up of peacetime and wartime production plans until the end of the Roosevelt administration. In January 1941, he was sent to China for discussions with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (representing the Kuomintang) and Zhou Enlai (representing the Chinese Communist Party) in the Chinese wartime capital of Chongqing. In an effort to preserve the appearance of American neutrality in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese government paid Currie&#x27;s expenses and government salary. He recommended that China be added to Lend-Lease upon his return in March, and he was put in charge of this program&#x27;s administration under the overall direction of President&#x27;s Roosevelt&#x27;s chief foreign policy advisor Harry Hopkins.

Currie was also assigned to expedite the Flying Tigers, a voluntary unit of American military pilots released for combat duty on behalf of China against Japan and technically part of the Chinese Air Force under the command of Claire Lee Chennault (Currie also organized a large training program in the U.S. for Chinese pilots). In May 1941, he presented a paper on Chinese aircraft requirements to General George C. Marshall and the Joint Board, which they accepted. This paper stressed the role that an air force in China could play in defending Singapore, the Burma Road, and the Philippines against Japanese attack, as well as the potential for strategic bombing of targets in Japan. These activities, together with his efforts to tighten economic sanctions against Japan, are said to have been partially responsible for provoking Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor.

Currie returned to Chongqing in July 1942 to try to ease strained relations between Chiang Kai-shek and General Joseph Stilwell, commander of American military forces in China. Currie was one of several presidential envoys who recommended Stilwell&#x27;s recall, but General Marshall refused to do so until October 1944. He also appears to have been involved in carrying out orders from President Roosevelt to get American intelligence services to return Soviet cryptographic documents and cease decoding operations, so as not to upset a wartime ally.

From 1943–1944, Currie served as Deputy Chief of the Foreign Economic Administration, where he recruited or recommended economists and others throughout the federal sector. Prominent examples include John Kenneth Galbraith, Richard Gilbert, Adlai Stevenson, and William O&#x27;Dwyer. Currie was a founding member of the War Agencies Employees Protective Association (created to help civilian federal employees acquire life insurance while serving in warzones) while at the FEA and served as WAEPA&#x27;s first president from May 1943 until his retirement in June 1945.

From 1944–1945, Currie was involved in loan negotiations between the U.S. and its British and Soviet allies and in preparations for the 1944 Bretton Woods conference (staged mainly by Harry White), which led to the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In early 1945, Currie headed a tripartite (American, British, and French) mission to Bern to persuade the Swiss government to freeze Nazi bank accounts and stop further shipments of German supplies through Switzerland to the Italian front.

==Espionage allegations==
Currie was identified as a Soviet agent by Soviet defector Whittaker Chambers in a 1939 meeting with Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs Adolf A. Berle, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a file on Currie. Currie allegedly informed Soviet contacts in the spring of 1944 that the Venona project was about to break the Soviet signals code, and he was one of those blamed after the war for losing China to the control of Communists.

Elizabeth Bentley, another Soviet defector, testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in August 1948 and named Currie and Harry Dexter White as part of the Silvermaster spy network. Although she had never met them in person, she stated that she had received information through cutouts (couriers), who were other Washington economists later determined to be Soviet agents. White and Currie responded by asking to appear before the Committee to rebut her charges, and did so later that month. White died three days later due to a serious heart condition, and he was later confirmed to be a source of Soviet intelligence in Venona intercepts and the notes of NKVD official Gaik Ovakimian. Currie was never charged or prosecuted with a crime.

In July 1949, Currie was awarded an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development contract to lead their first comprehensive survey mission—to Colombia. After his report was published in September 1950, he was contracted by the Colombian government to return as an adviser to a commission established to implement this report&#x27;s recommendations. This began a long relationship with the Colombian government, which also contracted him to lead a public administration mission and coordinate implementation of President Truman&#x27;s Point Four Program and a United Nations technical assistance program. In December 1952, he returned to the U.S. to testify before a New York grand jury investigating Owen Lattimore&#x27;s role in the publication of secret State Department documents in &quot;Amerasia&quot; magazine.

When Currie tried to renew his U.S. passport in 1954, he was refused on the grounds that he was now residing abroad and married to a Colombian woman (his second wife, Elvira Wiesner). However, he may have been identified by the then-secret Venona project, which had decrypted wartime Soviet cables where he was identified as a source of Soviet intelligence. He appears in these cables under the codename &quot;PAGE&quot; and in Soviet intelligence archives as &quot;VIM&quot;.

Historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Allen Weinstein, and Christopher Andrew have concluded that Currie knew that he was a Soviet asset. Currie&#x27;s biographer Roger J. Sandilands has agreed that Currie knew or was connected to individuals who turned out to be Soviet agents or their unwitting assets, but he has disagreed that the evidence is clear that Currie was himself an agent.

==Colombia==
After a 1953 Colombian coup d&#x27;état, Currie took a sabbatical from economic advisory work and devoted himself to raising Holstein cattle on a farm outside Bogotá, where he cultivated the highest-yielding dairy herd in the country for three consecutive years. With the return of civilian government in 1958, President Alberto Lleras Camargo personally conferred Colombian citizenship upon Currie, and he returned to advisory work for Lleras then President Guillermo León Valencia. Currie&#x27;s last book was on the role of economic advisors like himself in developing countries.

Between 1967 and 1971, Currie traveled abroad as a visiting professor at American, Canadian, and British universities: Michigan State University (1965), Simon Fraser University (1967–1968 and 1969–1971), the University of Glasgow (1968–1969), and the University of Oxford (1969). He returned permanently to Colombia in May 1971 at the behest of President Misael Pastrana Borrero to be the architect of a new &quot;Plan of the Four Strategies&quot; with a focus on urban housing and export diversification. New institutions created in support of this plan helped accelerate urbanization.

From 1971–1981, Currie was chief economist at the National Planning Department, followed by 12 years at the Institute of Savings and Housing until his death in 1993. In 1972, he established a unique index-linked housing finance system based on &quot;units of constant purchasing power&quot; for both savers and borrowers, which significantly boosted Colombia&#x27;s growth. In 1976, he played a &quot;major part&quot; in the first United Nations Human Settlements Programme conference in Vancouver, and he elaborated on his &quot;cities-within-the-city&quot; urban design and financing proposals (including the public recapture of land&#x27;s socially created &quot;valorización&quot; or &quot;unearned land value increments&quot; as cities grow) in &quot;Taming the Megalopolis&quot;. He was also a professor at the National University of Colombia, Javeriana University, and the University of the Andes.

In 1993, President César Gaviria awarded Currie the Order of Boyaca (Colombia&#x27;s highest peacetime decoration) one day before Currie&#x27;s death from a heart attack.

<doc id="750513" wikidata="Q478298" url="?curid=750513" title="USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)">
<text>USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; (FFG-58) is one of the final ships in the United States Navy&#x27;s of guided missile frigates (FFG). Commissioned in 1986, the ship was severely damaged by an Iranian mine in 1988, leading U.S. forces to respond with Operation Praying Mantis. Repaired and returned to duty, the ship served until decommissioned in 2015.

==Commissioning and namesake==
The frigate was named for Samuel B. Roberts, a Navy coxswain who was killed while evacuating the U.S. Marines during the battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. Roberts was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was the third U.S. ship to bear the coxswain&#x27;s name, after , a , commissioned in 1944 and sunk in the Battle off Samar later that year; and , a , commissioned in 1946 and struck in 1970.

&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was launched in December 1984 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine and sponsored by the wife of Jack Yusen, a member of DE-413&#x27;s crew. The frigate was put in commission in April 1986 under the command of Commander Paul X. Rinn.

==1988 deployment and mine strike==
&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; deployed from her homeport in Newport, Rhode Island, in January 1988, heading for the Persian Gulf to participate in Operation Earnest Will, the escort of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers during the Iran–Iraq War. &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; had arrived in the Persian Gulf and was heading for a refueling rendezvous with USS &quot;San Jose&quot; on 14 April when the ship struck an Iranian mine in the central Persian Gulf, an area she had safely transited a few days earlier. The mine blew a hole in the hull, flooded the engine room, and knocked the two gas turbines from their mounts. The blast also broke the keel of the ship; such structural damage is almost always fatal to a vessel. The crew fought fire and flooding for five hours and saved the ship. Among other steps, sailors cinched cables on the cracked superstructure in an effort to stabilize it. She used her auxiliary thrusters to get out of the minefield at . &quot;San Jose&quot;&#x27;s helicopters provided firefighting and engineering supplies to augment the crew&#x27;s efforts. According to &quot;How We Fight&quot;, by the US Naval War College, the ship never lost combat capability with her radars and Mark 13 missile launcher. However, according to &quot;No Higher Honor&quot; by Bradley Peniston, the ship lost power for at least five minutes. After power was lost, the radars were disconnected to allow restoration of the power grid. The ship lost track of an Sa&#x27;am frigate and an Iranian P-3 that it had been monitoring. Ten sailors were medevaced by HC-5 CH-46s embarked on &quot;San Jose&quot; for injuries sustained in the blast; six returned to &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; in a day or so. Four burn victims were sent for treatment to a military hospital in Germany, partly through the assistance of the 2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, USAF. Eventually they were moved to medical facilities in the United States.

When U.S. divers recovered several unexploded mines, they found that their serial numbers fitted into the sequence on mines seized the previous September aboard an Iranian mine-layer named . Four days later, U.S. forces retaliated against Iran in Operation Praying Mantis, a one-day campaign that was the largest American surface engagement since World War II. U.S. ships, aircraft, and troops destroyed two Iranian oil platforms allegedly used to control Iranian naval forces in the Persian Gulf, sank the Iranian frigate IRIS Sahand (1969), damaged another, and sank at least three armed high-speed boats. The U.S. lost one Marine helicopter and its crew of two airmen in what appeared to be a night maneuver accident rather than a result of hostile operations.

==Repairs==
On 27 June 1988, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was loaded onto , a semi-submersible heavy lift ship owned by Dutch shipping firm Wijsmuller Transport and carried back to Newport for $1.3 million. The frigate arrived at BIW&#x27;s Portland, Maine, yard on 6 October 1988 for repairs. The repair job was unique: the entire engine room was cut out of the hull, and a 315-ton replacement module was jacked up and welded into place. She undocked 1 April 1989 for sea trials.

The repairs were completed three weeks ahead of schedule at a cost of $89.5 million, $3.5 million less than expected. By comparison, , which was damaged by a moored mine during the 1991 Gulf War, was repaired for $24 million; however, the cruiser was not directly struck by the mine and her displacement is nearly twice that of &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;. The mine that nearly sank &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; had an estimated cost of $1,500.

After 13 months of repairs, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was returned to service in a 16 October 1989 ceremony.

==After repair==
&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; made her second deployment in 1990 for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. The frigate operated as part of the Red Sea Maritime Interception Force, an international force of ships that enforced U.N. sanctions against Iraq. The frigate&#x27;s sailors boarded more than 100 merchant ships in efforts to prevent cargo shipments to or from Iraq. On 28 March 1991, she returned to Newport.

&quot;Sammy B&quot;, as the ship is sometimes called, was later homeported in Mayport, Florida.

On 30 August 1991, Joseph A. Sestak took command of &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;, which was named the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s best surface combatant in the 1993 Battenberg Cup competition.

&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was decommissioned at Mayport on 22 May 2015, then towed to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia.

In late 2022, the ship was towed from Philadelphia to EMR International Shipbreaking Limited in Brownsville, Texas, for scrapping.

<text>The Nissan Micra, also known as the , is a supermini car (B-segment) that has been produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan from 1982 to 2023.

The Nissan Micra replaced the Japanese-market Nissan Cherry. It was exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealership network &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; until 1999 when the &quot;Cherry&quot; network was combined into Nissan Red Stage until 2003. Until Nissan began selling kei cars in Japan, the March was Nissan&#x27;s smallest vehicle, and was not renamed and sold at other Japanese Nissan dealership networks.


==First generation (K10; 1982)==

The original Micra (chassis name K10) was introduced onto the Japanese market in October 1982 as a challenger to the Honda City, Daihatsu Charade, Suzuki Cultus, and Toyota Starlet. It was intended to replace the Nissan Cherry as the company&#x27;s competitor in the supermini sector, as the Cherry model sold in Europe had progressively become larger with each successive generation. In Japan, it was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Cherry store&quot; locations, as the Japanese market Cherry was renamed March, benefiting from engineering contributions from Nissan&#x27;s 1966 acquisition of the Prince Motor Company, who originally developed the outgoing Cherry. The Micra had particularly low fuel consumption made possible by a specially developed engine only used in the Micra, uncommonly high gearing and a particularly low weight of in early European trim. The low weight target necessitated a minimum of insulation, meaning that early Micras were quite loud. Japanese owners benefitted from an engine below 1000 cc when it came time to pay the annual road tax obligation.
The body style was originally designed for Fiat as a replacement for the Fiat 127, but Fiat then adopted the Giugiaro-styled Uno instead. It was introduced in the European market in June 1983, and in Canada in 1984 for the 1985 model year (replacing the slightly larger Nissan Pulsar hatchbacks). Because the Micra was launched during Nissan&#x27;s rebranding effort to systematically phase out the Datsun name, a small appeared on the tailgate for the first two years, and in some European markets, the car was known as the &quot;Datsun-Nissan Micra&quot;. The Datsun badges had disappeared completely by the end of 1984. The Micra was initially available with an extremely refined all-aluminium MA10S SOHC engine. European market cars developed or in the high compression version coupled with the five-speed option. It was also available with either a four-speed or five-speed automatic transmission (called &quot;Nissanmatic&quot;). Both the automatic and five-speed manual gearboxes were unusual in a supermini at this time. The Nissanmatic model originally had a version of the 1-litre engine.

It was one of several important small cars to be launched onto the European market during 1983. Also launched that year were the Fiat Uno, Peugeot 205, Vauxhall Nova (a Britain-only model which had been launched across Europe the previous year as the Opel Corsa) and the second generation of the Ford Fiesta. It sold well in Britain, being launched there in June 1983 and peaking at more than 50,000 sales for the year in 1989, and was one of the most popular imported cars of its era. It was quietly discontinued in August 2023, and only the fourth-generation model remains in some markets.

===Mid-model refresh===
The model was revised in June 1985, identifiable by a restyled tailgate and larger rear lamp clusters. The Japanese market saw the debut of the first Micra Turbo/MA10ET, where Nissan grafted a turbocharger and added electronic fuel injection to the small 1.0 L engine. This version was never sold in Europe, where the only engines ever available were the 1.0 and 1.2 units. The 1.2, with the larger MA12 1.2 L engine with an electronically controlled carburettor with , arrived in late 1987. A non-catalyzed version produced . Another facelift came in March 1989, which consisted of some minor upgrades such as deeper bumpers, a new front grille, minor interior details, and headlight changes. This was also when the five-door hatchback version was introduced in Europe, shortly before Ford launched the third-generation Fiesta which also offered a 5-door model for the first time.

The Micra&#x27;s chassis spawned a number of variations. The Be-1 (BK10), launched at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1985 (but not sold until 1987), was a limited edition model with a more rounded bodyshape, and only 10,000 were sold. In 1987, the canvas-topped, retro-looking hatchback Pao (パオ) (PK10) was launched (also at the Tokyo Motor Show) and sold to the public in 1989; 51,657 units were sold. The canvas-topped Figaro (フィガロ) (FK10) coupé was unveiled at the same show in 1989, but not released until 1991. Because demand for the Figaro exceeded the 20,000 vehicles built, Nissan sold the car by lottery: winners could place orders for the car. Despite being a JDM-only model, the Figaro is one of the most imported models of the K10 derivatives; its popularity among numerous celebrity owners helped it earn cult status. The K10 ceased production on 21 December 1992, although its replacement had gone into production some months earlier.

During its lifetime, the Micra gained a good reputation for reliability and economy. In 1995, it topped the small car class in a reliability survey of four to six-year-old cars undertaken by the German Automobile Association (ADAC), with 7.5 recorded breakdowns per 1,000 vehicles for four-year-old Micras and 11.5 for six-year-old cars: this compared with 8.0 breakdowns per 1,000 cars for four-year-old Volkswagen Polos and 15.3 for six-year-old Polos. (The class loser was the Fiat Uno with 20.7 breakdowns per 1,000 for four-year-old cars and 37.3 for six-year-old Unos. In the longer term, the Micra would also go on to achieve a much higher survival rate than many of its competitors.)

For the 1991 model year, a rebadged Nissan Sentra B12 entered Canada to replace the Micra as the Nissan Sentra Classic after Nissan announced it would not import the Micra to Canada after 1991. The Sentra Classics were built in Mexico.

===Super S===

The European market Super S trim became available along with the second facelift in 1989. Sporty Super S included a factory body kit, racing seats and a tachometer and was only available in black, gray, white and red. Despite its appearance it had the same MA12 engine as the standard K10 Micra, although catalytic converters were a non-deletable feature on the car making them slightly less powerful than the non-cat cars.

=== Super Turbo===

In 1988, Nissan launched a limited 10,000-unit run of its homologated (certified) Nissan 1989 Micra Super Turbo (EK10GFR/GAR). Both this and the 1988 Micra R (EK10FR) featured the same highly advanced sequential compound charged (supercharger plus turbocharger) engine in an all-aluminium straight-four 930 cc eight-valve MA09ERT unit that produced at 6400 rpm. This car came with either a 3-speed automatic or 5-speed manual gearbox with viscous limited slip differential, as well as options such as air conditioning and electric mirrors. The Micra Super Turbo still holds the crown for the fastest production Micra in Nissan&#x27;s history, with factory performance figures of 7.7 seconds to go from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) and 15.5 seconds to run a quarter-mile. It has a top speed of (the maximum allowed to Japanese production cars at the time) and continued to be built until December 1991.

==Second generation (K11; 1992)==
===Micra K11 (1992)===
The second-generation K11 was built in the UK, Japan and Taiwan. It was launched in Japan in January 1992, and released in Europe in the fourth quarter of the year. It was powered by brand new all-aluminium 1.0 L (CG10DE) and 1.3 L (CG13DE) DOHC 16-valve engines, with and respectively (higher outputs were claimed in Japan, according to the JIS rather than DIN/ECE rating), both with ECCS (Electronic Concentrated Control System) fuel injection. It was the second Nissan model line to be produced in the UK at the Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK (NMUK) plant, Washington Tyne and Wear. A diesel version was offered with the 1.5 L PSA TUD market in Europe as Micra 1.5 D. Continuously variable transmission and power steering was an option on some models The equipment list also included safety features not usually available in this market segment: a toughened safety-cage and side-impact door beams were standard and pre-tensioning seat-belts and a driver&#x27;s air-bag were optional. However, the Mk2 Micra scored only a modest two stars in Euro NCAP testing in 1997. CVT was the only automatic option available in Europe; in Japan, the 1.0-litre models were also available with a traditional, four-speed automatic transmission.

Airbags, antilock brakes, electric windows, central locking and air conditioning were as either standard equipment or options on some models in the Micra range. The European model range consisted of 1.0L and LX, 1.3LX, SLX and Super S. The car soon won the European Car of the Year award for 1993, becoming the first Japanese car to do so. It also won the Good Design Award (a Trade and Industry Design award in Japan) along with the Car of the Year Japan award in 1992. At its introduction in 1993, it won the Automotive Researchers&#x27; and Journalists&#x27; Conference Car of the Year award in Japan. To celebrate these three major awards, Nissan manufactured 2,000 examples of the limited V3 Award edition.

After receiving minor changes in 1996, the Micra received a facelift in 1998, six years after its launch.

There was a Cabriolet (FHK11) unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1995, but it was not sold until August 1997, with an electric top. These were produced in limited numbers for the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) only. However, much like the Nissan Figaro, some have been imported into the UK unofficially. There was also an estate version called the March Box (WK11), which was unveiled in November 1999, with a split folding rear seat and either the 1.0- or 1.3-litre engines. Both engine options could be ordered either with a traditional, four-speed automatic transmission or with the revised Hyper-CVT transmission.

=== K11C (facelift; 1997)===
In May 1997, a facelift version was introduced in Japan. The UK-built Micra, meanwhile, was only updated in March 1998 and was built until early 2003. The cumulative visual changes from the first models included a revised front grille and headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, oval instead of round side repeater indicators, major changes to the interior and dashboard, redesigned rear light lenses, and a radio aerial repositioned from the top of the right-hand A-pillar to the middle of the roof, towards the rear. In Japan, the four-speed automatic became an option on the 1.3 as well, meaning that both engines could be ordered with three different types of transmission (5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, or the CVT).

In November 1999, the original facelift was replaced by a second version known as the K11C. For UK-built Micras, this took place in late 2000. While it still looked quite similar from the outside, the engines had been updated to run on the newer individual coilpack system (whereas the earlier models had been fitted with a distributor). As well as this, the secondary catalytic converter was removed and the primary catalytic converter (on the manifold) was enlarged. Other exterior changes included new lights on the bumper, an altered lower body, orange turn signals and minor changes to the interior. Further changes included a redesigned rear wiper which rested horizontally instead of vertically, and the centre high level brake lamp being reduced in size and mounted at the top of the rear window, instead of on the parcel shelf.

The 1.3 L (1275 cc) CG13DE engine offered in previous K11s were removed in the second facelift, and replaced by a 1,348 cc &quot;1.4&quot; unit (CGA3DE). This was still referred to as a 1.3 in Japan. The 1.0-litre CG10DE remained in the second facelift models but had a slightly higher power output; compared to the earlier . Also new in November 1999 was a four-wheel drive version, only offered on the hatchback with the 1.35-litre engine and CVT transmission.

In 2001, Muji, the well-known Japanese &quot;non-brand&quot; issued a limited release of 1,000 badgeless and decontented Nissan Marches, only available online. It was intended as an exercise to test their online marketing systems and was sold as the &quot;Muji Car 1000&quot; (ムジ・カー 1000). The rear seat is upholstered in vinyl, the hubcaps are minimal, and the car was only offered in &quot;marble white&quot;. The Muji Car 1000 has a four-speed automatic transmission and the 1-litre CG10DE engine.

By late 2002, the new K12 was introduced (although the S and SE models were still being built). They were fully replaced by K12 in early 2003.

===Bolero===
The Bolero was a luxury model available in certain markets from 1999 to 2003. It featured a redesigned exterior, and an interior which had leather seats.

The model with the different front was also available in Taiwan as Nissan Verita. The Verita was also sold in the Philippines.

===Super S===
The Super S trim was available in 1993–1997; the name was changed to SR when the Micra was facelifted. Differences include a slightly faster 3.6 turns lock-to-lock rack, over the standard 3.8 turns, different colour-coded front and rear bumpers, colour-coded wing mirrors and bump strips, rear wrap-around spoiler, front fog lights, remote fuel flap opening, wider 175/60/r13 tyres, rear ashtray, tachometer, more heavily bolstered seats, split folding rear seats and rear speaker shelf as standard. Features such as electric windows and power steering were still optional extras. The only engine available for the Super S was the 1.3-litre CG13DE twin cam, 16-valve engine.
===Micra Challenge===
In Greece, a hot hatch version was developed to compete with the massively successful Peugeot 106 Rallye and Fiat Punto GT. It was based on the CG13DE 16-valve engine but had a more aggressive overhead cam and a completely new exhaust system which together made 20 more horsepower. It was equipped with Eibach coilovers and Kayaba buffer suspension. Just like the Super S, it was fitted with 175/60/R13 tires.

===Latent Popularity===
In the UK and Europe over, the K11 Micra&#x27;s cheap and reliable nature would lend itself to both civilian and motorsport application, but it would find great success many years on in both its home and export markets.

Despite the image it had garnered of a &quot;grandparent&#x27;s car&quot; or as a &quot;first car&quot; in its home markets, the Micra would slowly become a hit among those looking for cheap motoring thrills. Various aftermarket products to modify them would be produced to improve the handling, power and aesthetics of the car.

The car also found a cult following in the city of Ibadan where, despite having to import them, taxi and ex-bus drivers saw potential. Coupled with its cheap secondhand pricing and the cheap aftermarket parts, small size and good fuel economy, the car has become a near permanent feature on the roads of Ibadan (Often appearing in a cream over burgundy colour scheme)

==Third generation (K12; 2002)==
===Micra K12 (2002)===
The next version of the Micra, the K12, was unveiled in production form at the 2002 Paris Motor Show, following the lines of the Nissan mm.e concept car presented the year before at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It was introduced to the Japanese market in February 2002 and to the European market at the end of 2002., The car was restyled, featuring a new, 70 mm longer wheelbase (developed with Renault), increased height and width, and prominent headlamps extending into the wings/fenders. The redesign coincided with the Japanese Nissan dealership network &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; being renamed &quot;Nissan Red Stage&quot; in 1999. Other features included a sliding rear seat and optional keyless ignition. The range of engines included improved 1.2 (CR12DE) and 1.4 (CR14DE) petrol models, and a Renault-sourced 1.5 diesel unit (K9K). The automatic CVT transmission of the previous model was replaced by a conventional automatic transmission.

Though its successor came out in 2010, the K12 was produced up through model year 2011.

Euro NCAP tested a Micra 1.2 S in 2003 achieving safety ratings of:
* Adult Occupant: 
* Pedestrian: 

====Nissan March K12 (2002)====
The vehicle was unveiled in Nissan Headquarters Gallery, and in Nissan&#x27;s Ginza Gallery in a wide array of colour variations.

March Enchante includes a swivel front passenger&#x27;s seat that turns 90° to facilitate easy ingress and egress. The March Driving Helper is fitted with hand-operated driving controls to enable persons with leg disabilities to drive and a control lever for operating the accelerator and the brakes with the left hand. These hand-operated controls are incorporated in the Autech Driving Control package, developed originally by Autech Japan for Nissan vehicles.

The March Enchante was unveiled at the 2004 Tokyo Motor Show.

The vehicles went on sale on 5 March 2002. Early models include 14e (5-door), 12c (3/5-door), 10b (3/5-door). Early March Enchante models include 12c (3/5-door). Early March Driving Helper models include 12c (3/5-door).

====Nissan March Rafeet and 4WD models (2002)====

The March Rafeet and 4WD models went on sale on 5 September 2002. Early March Rafeet models include the 12c and the 14c-four. Other four wheel drive models included March Enchante (14c-four, 14e-four), March Enchante flip seat (14c-four), and the March Driving Helper (14c-four).

====Nissan Micra R (2003)====
In 2003, Nissan UK, inspired by the Andros Trophy K11, unveiled the Micra-R, a one-off mid-engined K12. Shown at the Geneva Motor Show without running gear and engine, being only a display car, it was later given the go-ahead and Nissan commissioned Ray Mallock Ltd to insert a mid-mounted BTCC-derived Primera QG20DE engine for show and press demonstration purposes. In 2005, Nissan UK decided to replace the Primera engine with a VQ35DE from a 350Z with a modified Altima SE-R gearbox for user-friendliness on the road. This model was baptized 350SR, although it was not offered for sale. It was taken on to &quot;EVO&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;fast fleet&quot; for a period of time where it became a favourite of many of the writers. Other modifications to this car include a vented rear arch and a set of Rays wheels. To date, Nissan has no plans to put this model into production.

===2004 update===
====Nissan Micra (2004)====
Changes include addition of clear front indicator lamps, a new seven-spoke design of 15&quot; wheel covers, body-coloured powered door mirrors and door handles, front seats with improved support, addition of remote controls for the CD audio system and drive computer. Even though clear indicator lamps were added in 2004, not all models received them. Some Micras produced kept the original indicator lamps.

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2004 Paris Motor Show.

====Bolero, Rafeet====

Autech, a Nissan-owned company, unveiled alternative models called the Bolero and the Rafeet. The Bolero, like Autech&#x27;s versions of the K11, has the usual retro front end (which with the standard Micra headlights makes the car resemble the Lancia Ypsilon); the Rafeet has a more modern approach, resembling a BMW MINI, with either a black or white leather interior, whereas the Bolero has partial wood panelling and exclusive seating.

====Nissan Micra C+C (2005)====
In 2005, the K12 chassis spawned the coupé convertible model called the Nissan Micra C+C. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show, followed by the 2006 Geneva Motor Show. It was designed at the new London-based Nissan Design Europe studio, developed at the Nissan Technical Centre Europe at Cranfield, 
Bedfordshire and built, as with its predecessor, at the Sunderland plant. It is built as a modern interpretation of the 1991 Micra-based Nissan Figaro with a convertible hardtop instead of the canvas top the Figaro had. The electric folding glass roof is made by Karmann coachworks and has a 2+2 seating layout. The car is powered by a 1.4 or 1.6 L petrol engine, or a 1.5 L diesel available on European versions only. The Japanese model (with HR16DE engine, 5-speed manual or 4-speed electronic automatic transmission) went on sale as 2007 model in limited quantities (1500 units) on 23 July 2007.

There were originally four trim levels: Urbis, Sport, Essenza and Active Luxury.

In October 2013, &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine placed the Micra C+C on its list of &quot;The 13 worst cars of the last 20 years&quot;, on the basis that &quot;If you need us to justify its inclusion here, you are not only reading the wrong mag [...] As much fun as sticking chilli-infused toothpicks in your eyes.&quot;

===2005 update===


Changes to Nissan March include:
* Redesigned front grille, front bumper, 14-inch full wheel cover, rear combination lamps, rear bumper
* New seat cloth, reshaped seat
* Added floor trim cloth
* Redesigned meter
* Headlamp manual levellizer (with xenon headlamp auto levellizer)
* Change to HR15DE engine
Micra 12SR is a version of Nissan March with:
* CR12DE engine with stainless exhaust manifold, cylinder head port polish
* Redesigned suspension, power steering assist
* Enlarged front brake rotor
* Tail crossbar
* SR-exclusive front spoiler, rear under protector, large roof spoiler, under body aerodynamic parts
* Exclusive sport seat, meter, aluminium pedal, grade and black interior colour scheme
Japanese models went on sale on 25 August 2005.

====Nissan Micra 160 SR (2005)====
In 2005, Nissan Europe released a performance model of the K12. Dubbed the 160 SR, it is equipped with a 1.6 L HR16DE engine, giving and uprated sports suspension. In 2006, Nissan renamed the 160 SR to the Sport SR in line with name changes across the board for the K12. However, this rebranding was short-lived: the performance model reverted to the 160 SR name in late 2007.

The launch of the 160 SR coincided with a revision of the K12. The radiator grilles were given a chrome strip through the centre and the original amber indicators were replaced with clear ones. The rear bumper was restyled and made more robust (apparently in response to French parking habits). The interior was also given a makeover, with more supportive seats, thicker glass and better soundproofing.

There were originally six trim levels of the K12, but in 2006 they were simplified to just three: Initia, Spirita and Sport. In addition, the launch line-up of six engines was reduced to the most popular four. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show.

=== Micra K12C (2007)===

In late 2007, the Nissan Micra was facelifted again. It had several cosmetic tweaks: every model featured the standard racing grille taken from the K12 160 SR; the front headlights were tidied up (incorporating light blue-tinted sidelights) and the grilles housing the indicators were edged in chrome. Inside, there were new seat fabric designs, and the dashboard featured parts taken from other Nissans. New equipment included an audible speed warning, bluetooth connectivity with the vehicle and reversing sensors. All models (save for entry-level) were fitted with sport bumpers and spoilers on the sides and rear. Larger wing mirrors were also added on some models.

The 1.2-litre engine for the entry-level Visia was a unit, as opposed to the version on other grades. In addition, the Visia did not have the option of a 1.4 L engine. The 1.6 L engine was reserved for the 160 SR and as an option on the Active Luxury grade.

Starting from 2007, Nissan began selling the K12 in Australia. Imported from Japan, all were five-door hatchbacks, with the 1.4-litre petrol engine and automatic transmission. The only factory option was the City Collection pack, which included an upgraded six-disc sound system, six-spoke alloy wheels, and side and curtain airbags. The Australian specification adopted the Japanese facelift, with indicators integrated into the headlamps.

In 2009, it was reported that a total of 31,600 units were sold in Japan and nearly 122,000 worldwide.

==Fourth generation (K13; 2010)==

The first sketches of the fourth generation Nissan Micra, first internally referred as W02A as the development code and as K13 for the model code, were unveiled on 1 October 2009. The car was first displayed at the 80th Geneva International Motor Show.

It was sold in more than 160 countries, including Thailand from March 2010, India from July 2010, Europe from November 2010, and Indonesia from December 2010. It was the first March/Micra to be built in a North American plant, even though this generation did not have any sales in the United States. The K13 was however available in Canada after the spring of 2014.

It is based on the V platform with a new 1.2-litre HR12DE (XH5) , 3-cylinder engine (the first for a March/Micra). In the end of 2011 Nissan introduced the supercharged version of 1.2 (HR12DDR) called in Europe as Micra 1.2 DIG-S and the other engine 1.5 (HR15DE) and 1.6 (HR16DE) for the South American, Asian and Australian markets. The car is expected to be fuel efficient, delivering 18 km to a litre of petrol. The new idling stop system is reported to improve fuel economy by 2.0 km/L. It features variable control of voltage for power generation with an alternator (including regenerative charging function with braking energy).

The Micra&#x27;s coefficient of drag is just 0.32 achieved in part by the sleek roofline, with a raised rear end, which optimally adjusts airflow to the rear sides and other elements of the body designed to reduce air resistance such as door mirrors, a large front spoiler and the underbody configuration. A lightweight roof panel helps to keep weight to .

The Nissan March was unveiled at the 2010 Bangkok International Motor Show, followed by 2010 Beijing International Automobile Exhibition, and Nissan Global Headquarter gallery.

In 2021, it is only marketed in Mexico. It undergoes a significant redesign in the country along with a technological update.

Aside from supplying for the domestic market, Nissan Motor Indonesia (NMI) also exported the March to Australia badged as the Micra. While the domestic March is using the 1.2 L &quot;HR12DE&quot; engine, the Australia-bound Micra is fitted with the 1.5 L &quot;HR15DE&quot; engine. The production run was stopped in 2013 in favour of imported units from Thailand.

Production of the March began in Aguascalientes, Mexico in February 2011.

Production of the March in China by Dongfeng Nissan started in 2010, and ended in 2015 due to low sales.

In October 2011, the K13 Micra began to be produced in Brazil. In September 2020, production ended there.

In July 2022, Nissan Motor Thailand ended production of the March after 11 years of production.

In August 2022, Nissan discontinued sales of the March in Japan, as Nissan shift its focus on the Nissan Note (that sold 8 times more compared to the March in the first half of 2022) and the promotion of electrification on their model line-up.

It also has better durability and can support more horsepower and torque. The manual transmission ratio and the maximum speed in each manual transmission gear (in Thailand spec).

=== Safety ===
EuroNCAP tested this model of the Nissan Micra as a standard equipment LHD, 5-door hatchback, registered in 2010. They scored it accordingly:
* Overall 
* Adult Occupant , 30 points
* Child Occupant , 39 points
* Pedestrian , 21 points
* Safety Assist , 4 points

The Micra scored well in the test and received 4 stars from a possible 5, although the car was penalised for &quot;loading the dummy in an unrealistic way&quot; and increasing chest damage to the driver and passenger. Despite this, the results were decent for a hatchback and the car offers good protection for side and front end impacts.

==Fifth generation (K14; 2016)==

The fifth-generation Micra, the K14, was unveiled at the 2016 Paris Motor Show. It has all-new exterior and interior design and shares the same platform as its predecessor.

The fifth-generation Micra is only available in Europe and selected markets such as South Africa, Israel, Turkey, Morocco, and New Zealand, while the previous generation remained in production for markets such as Australia, Canada, India, Latin America, Indonesia, and Thailand. Sales in Europe began in March 2017. In South Africa, the fifth-generation Micra is sold alongside the fourth-generation Micra Active and sales began in June 2018. By 2022, the Micra Active was no longer sold in South Africa and only the fifth generation &quot;New&quot; Micra was still available. Plans to sell the Micra in Latin America were scrapped since the model would be too expensive. Similar plans to bring the new fifth-generation Micra into Canada were also scrapped since the model&#x27;s main selling point was its just over $10,000 price, which the new model could not match.

Its range of engines is shared with the Renault Clio IV. An entry level, 1.0-litre petrol engine that produces is the base engine, while it was also offered with a 1.5-litre diesel engine that produces and a 0.9 petrol engine that produces ( with its overboost function). The K14 Micra comes with a system called trace control, which prevents understeer by softly pinching the brakes.

Currently, there are five core trims available from - Visia, Visia+, Acenta, N-Connecta, N-Sport and Tekna.

Each one has more advanced systems such as hill start assist and reversing camera, premium rims, 4 speaker system and a leather steering wheel.

=== Safety ===
The fifth generation Micra brought more safety features such as side airbags (head and chest) and a more rigid unibody. EuroNcap tested an Acenta Nissan Micra (2017).

* Overall 
* Adult Occupant , 34.6 points
* Child Occupant , 39.1 points
* Pedestrian , 28 points
* Safety Assist , 6 points
===Facelift===

The Micra was refreshed on 28 January 2019 and adds a new N-Sport trim.

A further slight restyling of the Micra was presented in November 2020 and added the new N-Design trim.

With it came things like hill start assist, Intelligent Ride Control, and Intelligent Trace Control.

Selected grades also got systems from the Nissan Intelligent Mobility suite, including high beam assist, Intelligent Lane Intervention, traffic sign recognition, and Intelligent Forward Emergency Braking with pedestrian recognition.

Two new engines were added to the lineup, the 999 cc HR10DET/HRA0 turbo i3 and the 1461 cc Renault K9K turbo-diesel straight-four engine. 

=== Special Editions ===

=== Kiiro ===
In 2022, Nissan released a special edition of the Micra called &quot;Kiiro&quot; (&quot;Yellow&quot; in Japanese). This version adds lemon yellow elements to the lower area of both bumpers and the side doors, in conjunction with a Gunmetal Grey paintjob, the only colour available, and with the 17-inch wheels which also have a darker tone The Kiiro is based on the Micra Acenta model, fitted with the 999 cc HR10DET/HRA0 turbo i3.

Primarily sold in Portugal and the United Kingdom, the initial plan was to release 100 units, however was later expanded to 200.

=== Bose ===
Nissan also released a special variant called Bose, which added a Bose stereo setup. The stereo includes twin nearfield speakers built into the headrest on the driver&#x27;s seat and PersonalSpace controls for fine tuning the audio. It uses the same rims as the Kiiro and a special trim. The Micra Bose is available in two colours – &quot;Enigma Black&quot; or &quot;Gunmetal Grey&quot;. There were also touches of &quot;Energy Orange&quot;, orange accents on the bumper, hood, roof, doors, rear view mirrors and 17-inch wheels.

It is equipped with either the 999 cc M281 straight-three engine or a 1461 cc Renault K9K turbodiesel straight-four engine. 3,000 examples were made available across Europe.

==Marketing by country==
===Australia===
The UK-built Micra K11 was briefly exported to the Australian market beginning in 1995 with a three model line up, base 3-door LX, 5-door SLX and 3-door Super S (of which only
303 were ever sold in Australia and demand a hefty price premium over the other models). Class leading performance, a surprisingly dynamic chassis with well sorted suspension, roomy interior and above average build quality were the Micra&#x27;s strengths in comparison to its Korean competitors like the Hyundai Excel, Daewoo Cielo and Ford Festiva. A poor exchange rate between the UK and Australia meant the Micra&#x27;s pricing was rather steep and Australian buyers saw the cheaper Koreans and more established Japanese-sourced superminis, such as the Suzuki Swift and Daihatsu Charade, as offering better value for money. Also, the Micra received the lowest possible rating (one star) in Australian crash tests. The Micra was dropped from Nissan Australia&#x27;s line-up in 1997.

Nissan reintroduced the Micra to Australia in 2007, being sold only as a 5-door hatchback, and coming from Japan and not the UK. The fourth generation Micra was introduced to Australia in October 2010 and imported from Thailand. Nissan dropped the Micra from the Australian market on 29 April 2016.

===Canada===
In Canada, the K10-J was sold and branded as the Nissan Micra. It came standard with the larger MA12S inline 4-cylinder OHC 1.2 L (1235 cc) engine. The Nissan Micra was finally discontinued in Canada in 1991, replaced by the Nissan Sentra Classic.

In 2007, Nissan introduced the substantially larger Versa to the Canadian line up as the new entry-level model.

On 9 January 2014, Nissan Canada Inc. announced the return of the Micra back to the Canadian market after 21 years of absence. Sales started in spring 2014 as a 2015-year model, taking the place of the slow-selling Versa sedan.

The company revealed the car&#x27;s starting price of C$9,998 for the base, 5-speed manual transmission model at the 2014 Canadian International Auto Show in February. The price made it the least expensive new car in the country by a significant margin.

The available three trim levels are: S, SV, and SR.

The base S trim in its most basic configuration comes standard with a 5-speed manual transmission, along with plastic door handles, manual door locks, manual windows, and manual black mirrors, but lacks both air conditioning and cruise control. Furthermore, it includes 15-inch steel wheels with hubcap covers, intermittent rear wipers, large cupholders, 60/40 split folding rear seats, floor mats, and a two-speaker AM/FM/CD player with an aux-in jack as standard equipment. An optional 4-speed automatic transmission for the S trim adds air conditioning, cruise control with steering wheel controls, a USB port, as well as silver accents on the shift knob and steering wheel.

The SV is the mid-trim variant, which adds body-coloured door handles and mirrors, 2 extra rear speakers, a Bluetooth Hands-free phone system, a rearview monitor, power heated mirrors, air conditioning, and cruise control, power door locks with keyless entry, power windows, an armrest, a height-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, a passenger grip handle, chromed interior door handles, and an upgraded sporty trim cloth. The SV style package adds 15-inch aluminum alloy wheels and a body-coloured rear spoiler with LED centre high-mounted stop light.

The SR model, being the higher-end trim, adds a rear spoiler and side skirts, giving it a more sporty appearance, as well as the addition of fog lights, a glossy centre console dash, a colour display audio system with a reverse camera and a USB port, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, a chrome exhaust finisher, and 16-inch aluminum black-painted alloy wheels.

All trim levels of the Canadian-spec Micra come standard with a 5-speed manual transmission as well as front-wheel drive and a DOHC 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine rated at 109 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 107 lb-ft of torque at 4,400 rpm.

During the final model year, all 2019 Nissan Micra trim models were equipped with a backup camera due to the new regulation law in Transport Canada mandating all new vehicles to be equipped with a backup camera, which took effect starting in mid-2018.

The Micra was once again discontinued after the 2019 model year, due to the new generation Micra being &quot;not budget-friendly&quot;. It was instead replaced yet again with the newer third-generation Versa.

===China===
In China, Dongfeng Nissan released the Micra K13 on 30 August 2010. Four trims with 1.5-litre engines (HR15DE) are available, priced between 69,900 and 92,900 yuan. It has since been discontinued.

===India===
One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 is located in India.

Nissan Micra is available in India with four petrol and two diesel variants. The four petrol variants of Nissan Micra are: Nissan Micra XE, Nissan Micra XE Plus, Nissan Micra XL and Nissan Micra XV. All the four variants are powered by the 1.2 L, 1198 cc, petrol engine with five-speed manual transmission that delivers at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4000 rpm. These variants differ from each other by the interior comfort, luxury and safety features. A notable feature includes a standard air bag across the range although ABS is available only on the top variant.

The diesel variants of Nissan Micra are Nissan Micra Diesel XV and Nissan Micra Diesel XV Premium. The Nissan Micra diesel is loaded with a 1.5-litre, 4-cylinder, 8-valve, SOHC, 1461 cc, common rail powertrain that is capable of developing maximum power of at 4000 rpm and of highest torque at 2000 rpm with the same 5-speed.

A rebranded variant of Micra named &quot;Pulse&quot; is sold by Renault in India. It has the same interiors as the Micra though the styling on the exterior is slightly modified. Having the same specifications, features and engines as the Micra, it is similarly priced.

In India, the Micra was offered with a diesel unit: the 1.5 dCI K9K produced by Renault. It was discontinued on 11 May 2020, alongside the Sunny saloon, due to both cars not being compliant with India&#x27;s Bharat Stage VI emissions standards, leaving Nissan with the locally-built Kicks and Magnite crossover SUVs and the GT-R as the only cars offered by Nissan for the Indian market.

===Mexico===
One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 is located in Mexico.

The Nissan Micra K13 is called the Nissan March in Mexico and went on sale in late March 2011, it began production at the Aguascalientes plant in early March.

The Nissan March is sold in 4 trim levels: Drive, Sense, Advance and SR.

The base Drive trim level does not have air conditioning and rear window wipers and has black mirrors; this trim level also lacks a radio and comes with 14-inch steel wheels with wheel covers.

The Sense trim level adds air conditioning, MP3 radio player, colour-coded mirrors and a rear window wiper. This model also comes with 14-inch steel wheels with wheel covers.

The Advance trim level adds 15-inch alloy wheels an optional 4-speed automatic transmission and also adds 2 front airbags for the driver and passenger.

The SR trim adds side skirts and a rear spoiler for a more sporty appearance and has the same alloy wheels only with a darker colour.

All trim levels come standard with a 5-speed manual transmission and with the 1.6-litre engine with .

It replaced the Nissan Platina in its assembly plant and lineup, plus the previous-generation Micra was sold in Mexico using the Micra name.
Even though the March was meant to replace the Platina sedan, the Juke (using the same Micra platform) took the Micra&#x27;s Mexican place after the 2011 model year.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, the K11 March was sold from 1993 to 2007. It was sold in three generations. The last generation was a facelifted and improved version called the Super March. It had a digital instrument cluster, LED rear light clusters, side mirror indicators, and an updated front end with crystal headlights. It also came with a semi leather interior with rear headrests. Another more upscale K11 variant, known as the Nissan Verita, was produced. This featured retro styling inside and out. Notable differences included rounded headlights and taillights, a distinctive front end, along with a chrome and faux wood trimmed interior. All Taiwan K11s came with the CG13DE engine. There was also a three-box sedan called the &quot;March Cubic&quot; designed exclusively for the Taiwanese market by Nissan Yulon; its taillights, trunklid, and rear bumpers were different from those used in Japanese market versions.

At the end of 2011, the Nissan March returned to the Taiwanese market as the K13. The HR15DE is currently the only engine available. A 4-speed automatic is the only transmission option as well. The K13 March was discontinued in 2019.

===Thailand===
One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 was located in Thailand.

In Thailand, the Micra K13 was launched, as Nissan March, at the Bangkok International Motor Show on 26 March 2010, priced from 375,000 baht ($11,600) to 537,000 baht. By early July 2010, the company has received about 8,000 sales order and said new buyers would have to wait for five months. The company expects to produce 90,000 units in 2010.

In April 2013, the facelifted version of March are revealed, with some upgrade on equipment include LED rear lamps, redesigned grille, headlamps, wheels, improved interior and addition of front airbags in all version. The K13 March was discontinued in July 2022.

===UK===
From 1992, Micras were built in the UK at the NMUK plant in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, where a total of 2,368,704 were built at its close in July 2010.

====K10====
The Micra K10 first went on sale the UK over the summer of 1983, and it was an instant sales success. In its best year, 1990, it was the eleventh most popular new car in the UK with just under 50,000 sales. It was a popular choice with driving instructors and undemanding motorists thanks to its ease of driving, solid build and durable mechanical components. 343,411 were sold in nearly a decade. As recently as early 2007, almost 15 years after the last examples were sold, 96,421 examples were still reported to be in circulation, and four years on, as the 20th anniversary of its demise approaches, the number remaining on Britain&#x27;s roads is likely to be still well into five figures. It compares particularly well to many other popular small cars in Britain of its era, particularly the British-built Austin Metro and Italian Fiat Uno.

====K11====
The second incarnation of the Micra, the K11, was launched in the UK at the end of 1992, with production taking place in Britain at the Sunderland plant rather than in Japan. It was available with a limited range of engines: 1.0 and 1.3 petrol units. A facelift over the summer of 2000 saw the 1.3 shelved and replaced with a 1.4 unit. This upgrade, after a previous makeover in 1998, enhanced the Micra&#x27;s appeal and it was still fairly popular on the launch of its successor in December 2002.

The Micra K11 (as it is known in Europe), was the third model after the Nissan Bluebird and Primera built in Nissan&#x27;s NMUK plant in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear.

In 1998, the Sunderland, plant produced its millionth Micra, becoming the first Japanese manufacturer in Europe to achieve the milestone.

On 16 January 2013, popular YouTube stars Vsauce and FastFuriousAndFunny held up a Nissan Micra K11 with 180 rubber bands. They later smashed the car.

====K12====
Like the previous version of the Micra, the third generation model, the K12, was made at the Sunderland plant. It had a wider range of engines, including 1.2 petrol and Renault-sourced 1.5 direct-injection diesel powerplants, and offered an improved driving experience. Its chassis would form the basis of the next Renault Clio, launched in 2005 but still built in France. This stylish, all-new Micra helped Nissan bolster its market share of the supermini sector, which had been declining in the final year or two of its predecessor&#x27;s life. Although it has never featured in the SMMT&#x27;s official top 10 best-selling cars in the UK, it has been among the best-selling 10 cars in Britain among private buyers for virtually all of its production life.

In 2003, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; programme featured a segment on cars that gave value for money, highlighting specification that could be purchased for £9,000. The Micra K12 was selected and tested by presenter Richard Hammond, who gave it a positive review. This was despite comparing its qualities to those of a Boeing 737, concluding that the Micra &quot;had all the toys&quot;. However, when Hammond tested the Micra C+C in 2006, he was less than enthusiastic. This was because his model was coloured pink and as a result, he spent most of the segment driving it with a paper bag over his head, especially during a drive around the town of Ledbury in Herefordshire.

The pink C+C was one of only five, made specifically for Nissan&#x27;s sponsorship of the C+C TLC Tour in 2005–06, in support of the Breakthrough Breast Cancer charity. Such was the public&#x27;s response that Nissan subsequently announced the launch of the Micra C+C Pink, limited to 100 units. These quickly sold out and another production run was announced in August 2006, this time limited to 175 cars.

In July 2004, Nissan announced that a Coral Blue K12 Micra had become NMUK&#x27;s one millionth car for the UK market, and that its Sunderland plant had produced over 250,000 K12s since the model&#x27;s launch, for sale in up to 45 markets.

In August 2006, the K10 was still receiving credit for its impressive durability. An &quot;Auto Express&quot; survey revealed that of the 340,000 K10 Micras registered in the UK between 1983 and 1992, 96,000 were still on the road – nearly 30%, an impressive figure for a car which had been out of production for 14 years. This gave it a far higher rating than the Fiat Uno and the Austin Metro, both of which had dwindled away to less than 3%.

In 2007, with the Micra K12C, the model grades were brought into line with the rest of the Nissan UK range, namely Visia, Acenta, Tekna, 160 SR and Active Luxury.

The Micra C+C convertible was available in Visia, Acenta, Tekna and Active Luxury grades. However, the 1.6-litre engine is available for all models, save the Visia.

==Reputation, popularity and sales==
The K10/K11 generations of Micra were known for reliability, excellent build quality, and user friendliness. The K12 model has received consistently good reviews, with the main criticisms being limited rear seat head room and luggage space.

The insurance company Folksam rated the models produced between 1988 and 1995 as dangerous in the event of a crash. However, safety specifications improved with successive models. The Micra&#x27;s Euro NCAP ratings are two stars for the K11 and four for the K12.

The K12 Micra came top of its class in &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine&#x27;s Security Supertest in 2003, passing both entry and driveaway tests and achieving a maximum score for its locking system and immobiliser.

In 2005, the UK motor insurance research expert Thatcham introduced a standard for keyless go, requiring the device to be inoperable at a distance of more than 10 cm from the vehicle. In an independent test, the Micra was found to be the most secure, while certain BMW and Mercedes models failed, being theoretically capable of allowing cars to be driven away while their owners were refuelling.

In &quot;What Car?&quot;&#x27;s Reliability Supertest in 2007, Nissan was ranked 6th out of 26 manufacturers overall, with the K11 Micra (1998–2002) being its most reliable model.

In Mexico, the Nissan March has been a commercial success because of its affordable price at $150,800, compact dimensions ideal for city driving, and low maintenance and ownership costs. The March has been awarded in the Most Trusted Compact Car category awarded by Reader&#x27;s Digest Mexico for 3 consecutive years.
==Motorsport==
Nissan first entered the Micra in motorsports with the March Superturbo R. Introduced in 1987, this rare pre-facelift K10 weighed in at with half interior, roll cage and tool kit. It was built for the new sub-1600 cc Group A class, and shortly after in 1988 Nissan released the March Superturbo as a road car.

While the March was a favourite with the drivers in the Japanese Rally Championship, veteran Swedish rally driver Per Eklund finished the 1988 RAC Rally in 21st position and the 1989 Acropolis Rally Greece in 10th place.
During the K11&#x27;s production life, there was a series of national rally championship trophies held all over Europe called the Micra Challenge. This was intended as a cheap introduction to rallying, as the cars all had identical 1.3 L race-prepared engines. The UK series ran between 1995 and 1999. This model is still used in club and national rallies. In France, the 1.3 L model was used as the basis for a circuit racing one-make cup for celebrity drivers, the Nissan Stars Cup. In Portugal, the Micra spawned a one-make trophy alongside the National Rally Championship for Beginners.

Both K10 and K11 models are very popular choices for beginner autocross but due to K10s getting rarer, K11s are more commonly used now. The K11 is also very popular as a &#x27;micro&#x27; banger in the UK, competing in 1200 cc engine limit classes with success.

In the late 1990s, a K11 was adapted into a VQ30 mid-engined 4WD configuration to race in the Trophée Andros, the French ice racing series. Drivers who raced this car include Érik Comas, Philippe Gache, Stéphane Peterhansel and Emmanuel Collard.

Nissan sponsors a one-make series in Japan called the March Cup, which has been running since the introduction of the K10. Usually a JGTC support race, it is held in two separate five-round championships called West Japan Series and East Japan Series, and a ladies series running simultaneously. At the end of the season, the best-performing cars from both sides meet up for the Champions Cup final at the end the season.

Beginning of 2015, Nissan Canada sponsored the Nissan Micra Cup. It consisted 10 races across 5 weekends in Quebec. Each racing weekend included a 30-minute trial, a 30-minute qualifying session, and two 30-minute races.

<text>Cecelia Holland (born December 31, 1943) is an American historical novelist.

==Early life and education==
Holland was born December 31, 1943, in Henderson, Nevada. She grew up in Metuchen, New Jersey, where she started writing at age 12, recording the stories she made up for her own entertainment. From the beginning, she focused on history because &quot;being twelve, I had precious few stories of my own. History seemed to me then, as it still does, an endless fund of material.&quot;

Holland attended Pennsylvania State University for a year, and received her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 from Connecticut College, where she took a course in creative writing and was encouraged by poet William Meredith and short story writer David Jackson. Jackson took a novel Holland wrote for his seminar to an editor at Atheneum, and her first novel, &quot;The Firedrake&quot;, was published in 1966. She had just dropped out of graduate school at Columbia University to work as a clerk at Brentano&#x27;s in Manhattan. Holland has been a full-time professional writer ever since. &quot;The Firedrake&quot; was the fourth novel she had written but was the first published; &quot;Jerusalem&quot; is the final, mature version of one of these earlier ones. Pieces of the other two also have made their way into her published work.

==Bibliography==
==Literary style==
In the Autumn 2002 issue of the Historical Novel Society magazine, &quot;Solander&quot;, Sarah Johnson writes, &quot;What sets Cecelia’s work apart in the genre is not just her productivity but also her versatility; she has the unique ability to make most any historical period her own.

She records the often harsh details of life in the distant or recent past and her depiction of it involves considerable research. Her character-driven plots often are developed from the viewpoint of a male protagonist. While including plenty of action (her battle scenes are noteworthy for their bottom-up viewpoint and understated verisimilitude), her work focuses on the life of the mind, whatever that might mean in a particular culture, and especially on politics, in the broadest sense, whatever politics might be in a monarchial, feudal or tribal society.

In her medieval novels in particular, she makes her characters, including Huns and Mongols, speak in colloquial English. This is intended to give the reader the impression of listening in on a conversation in the speakers&#x27; own vernacular.

Most of her novels have grown slowly in the back of her mind, often as the result of articles and essays written by her. &quot;The Belt of Gold&quot; and &quot;The Lords of Vaumartin&quot;, however, were written &quot;cold&quot; as the result of requests by her editor. While she claims not to choose fictional settings based on their infrequent usage by other writers, she has said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t dare do the Civil War, because it&#x27;s so well known, every damn detail, it would be so stifling.&quot;

&quot;Floating Worlds&quot; (1976), is a science fiction novel written in a similar style. It is an epic novel set in approximately the 40th century AD, by which time a colonized Solar System hosts a variety of political systems. Paula Mendoza, an ex-prisoner from anarchist Earth, becomes a diplomat and the lover of one of the Styth, a variant human subspecies who live in floating cities.

== Personal life ==
During the late 1990s, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described Holland as a &quot;bohemian den mother&quot; and historical novelist who had written 24 books. As of 2011, Holland lived in Fortuna, a small town in rural Humboldt County, California. She has three daughters and five grandchildren. For ten years, Holland taught two three-hour creative writing classes a week at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California. She was visiting professor of English at Connecticut College in 1979. Holland was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1981–1982.

<doc id="750525" wikidata="Q8334244" url="?curid=750525" title="Latin Patriarchate of Antioch">
<text>The Latin patriarch of Antioch was a prelate of the Latin Church created in 1098 by Bohemond I of Taranto, founder of the Principality of Antioch, one of the crusader states.

The jurisdiction of the Latin patriarchs in Antioch extended over the three feudal principalities of Antioch, Edessa, and Tripoli. Towards the end of the twelfth century the island of Cyprus was added. In practice they were far more dependent upon the popes than their predecessors, the Greek patriarchs. After the fall of Antioch (1268) the popes still appointed patriarchs, who, however, were unable to take possession of the see. Since the middle of the fourteenth century they were only titular dignitaries. The title was last conferred in 1925. The recipient resided in Rome and was a member of the chapter of the basilica of St. Mary Major. The Basilica of St. Mary Major was the Antioch patriarchium, or papal major basilica assigned to the patriarch of Antioch, where he officiated when in Rome and near which they resided.

==Background==
The seat of the patriarch of Antioch was one of the oldest and most prestigious in Christendom. At one time it was the principal city of Syria; the third largest city of the Roman Empire, after Rome and Alexandria. When the East–West Schism took place in 1054, the Greek patriarchs of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria sided with the patriarch of Constantinople.

After 1054, the See of Antioch came under the influence of the Byzantine Empire. As part of his grand strategy, the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sought to utilize the military elan and prowess of the Frankish and European princes of the First Crusade in recovering for him the Eastern Roman Empire, including Antioch and its See.

However, after the Siege of Antioch in 1098, Bohemond I of Taranto refused to submit Antioch to Byzantine rule and set himself up as prince of Antioch.

==History==
===During the Crusades===
The crusaders reinstated at first the Greek patriarch, then John IV as long as the Orthodox patriarch remained there they tried to make him a Catholic instead of appointing a rival. However, when at last he fled to Constantinople they considered the see vacant. Thereupon the Latin Christians elected (1100) a patriarch of their own, an ecclesiastic by the name of Bernard who had come to the Orient with the crusaders. From that time Antioch had its Latin patriarchs until the last incumbent Christian was put to death by the Sultan Baibars during the conquest of the city in 1268. The Greeks also continued to choose their patriarchs of Antioch, but these lived generally in Constantinople.

The Byzantine Empire was greatly offended by this and tried to re-establish either a Greek patriarchate or a joint patriarchate. Though the Treaty of Devol in 1108 nominally restored a Greek patriarch, the treaty was never enforced. Under Manuel I Komnenos there was briefly a joint patriarchate when Antioch fell under Byzantine control, but for the most part there was only a Latin patriarch. The Byzantine Empire recognized this de facto control of the See of Antioch and the Latin Patriarch soon played a key role in solidifying ties between the Crusader states and the Byzantine Empire. This represented one of the sole instances of coordinated action by Byzantine and the Franks throughout the crusader period, and led to a number of joint political, diplomatic, military, and marriage alliances. The Latin Patriarch of Antioch was established to serve the Catholic members of the diocese and represent all Christians living in its territory and was one of the major ecclesiastical authorities in the Crusader states. Throughout the Crusader period both Greeks and Latins served under its hierarchy which included numerous suffragan bishops, abbots, cathedrals, monasteries, and churches under its ecclesiastical rule. 

In 1206, seeing that the Byzantine Empire was no longer a threat and wanting to gain the goodwill of his Greek subjects as he feared the Armenians of Cilicia, Prince Bohemond IV restored a Greek Patriarch to Antioch for a short period. The Mongols also favored a Greek Patriarch, but Latin Patriarchs held the see until the Crusaders had been ousted. 

===The Patriarchate in Exile===
In 1342, the Greek Patriarchate transferred his seat to Damascus which grew in prominence as the city of Antioch&#x27;s Christian and overall population declined. 

Both Latin and Greek Patriarchs continued to be appointed by the Pope and the Byzantine Emperor respectively during the following centuries. However, the Latin Patriarch was a titular office, with its seat at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. It continued to play a role in helping to protect various isolated Christian communities in the Near East and eventually secured their unity with Rome. The last holder of this office was Roberto Vicentini, who held it until his death 1953. 

===Suppression===
The seat remained vacant until the title was suppressed in January 1964, along with the titles of the Latin Patriarchate of Alexandria and Constantinople, it was no longer mentioned in the Vatican yearbook (rather than being announced as being abolished). This was after Pope Paul VI met with Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople (see Pope Paul VI and ecumenism), showing the Latin Church by this point was more interested in reconciliation with the Eastern Church, abolishing the titular title.

<text>The Alfa Romeo 147 (Type 937) is a small family car produced by the Italian automaker Alfa Romeo from 2000 to 2010. The 147 was voted European Car of the Year in 2001.

The 147 was launched at the Turin Motor Show in June 2000 as a replacement for the Alfa Romeo 145 and 146 hatchbacks and is based on the running gear of the larger 156 saloon. It was sold with 1.6, 2.0, and 3.2-liter petrol engines, and a 1.9-liter diesel engine. A paddle-operated &quot;Selespeed&quot; automatic transmission was available from launch.

Two trim levels, Turismo and Lusso were available, and the 147 was the first Alfa Romeo to have dual-zone climate control and electronic traction control. In production for ten years, the 147 was one of the oldest small family cars on sale in Europe at the time of its replacement, reaching a production figure of 651,823.

==Styling==

The 147 was designed by Walter de Silva and Wolfgang Egger. The 147 received praise for its styling on launch, later it won styling awards. The 147 range was revamped in 2004, with the exterior styling changed to resemble the new 159 and Brera models, and Alfa Romeo Visconti concept car. The 147 had a drag coefficient (&quot;C&quot;d) of 0.32.

==Launch==
In 1999, Alfa Romeo confirmed that it would replace its 145/146 hatchbacks with an all-new model, which was unveiled as the 147 at the Turin Motor Show in June 2000. The first deliveries were in October 2000 in left-hand drive markets, and the right-hand-drive UK versions shortly thereafter. It received the 2001 European Car of the Year award.

==Development==

The 147 was facelifted at the end of 2004: new front grille, new headlights, new rear lights, and the interior was changed on all models besides the GTA version. A more powerful diesel engine arrived and the suspension was also tweaked. 

In 2007, the 147 1.9 JTD Q2 version was launched, with a front Torsen limited slip differential. Alfa Romeo presented a new limited edition 147 called &quot;Ducati Corse&quot; at the 2007 Bologna Motor Show. The car had a JTD diesel engine and Q2, a front Torsen limited slip differential.

The 147 was replaced by the Giulietta in May 2010.

===High performance versions===

The hot hatch 147 GTA model was launched in 2002. The GTA used a 3.2 V6 engine, produced and had a top speed of . It has a widened body (15 mm at each side) to accommodate the 225/45R17 tyres. 

Most models have six-speed manual transmissions; whilst a smaller number of other models use the Selespeed automated manual system. In total, 5,029 147 GTAs were built, 1004 of which were Selespeeds.

London-based after market tuner Autodelta has produced a &quot;bored out&quot; version of the GTA, sporting a 3.7 litre V6, producing , and a split axle differential gear for the front wheels. Autodelta has also made a Rotrex supercharged version, producing .

==Engines==
==Connect==
Connect is an onboard information system: an onboard telematics system located in the central console that via its monitor gave access to satellite navigation and hands free GSM phone as well as allowing the user to adjust radio and CD player settings.

==Reception==

The handling of 147 was praised in some reviews, in spite of criticism regarding the light (sensitive) steering, which makes some drivers feel less involved. However, light steering does help during parking maneuvers. Other criticisms of the 147 included a cumbersome gearshift, unsupportive seats, and the lack of interior space compared to its rivals. 

The car was noted for its pleasant engine note. The 147 suffers from fairly poor resale value in Great Britain. 

The 147 GTA and 147 Autodelta GTA have been road tested by Jeremy Clarkson, and featured on television show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, with a power lap around the track by The Stig. In his review of Autodelta 147 GTA car for &quot;The Sunday Times,&quot; Clarkson described the acceleration as &quot;Ferrari throttle? Forget it. When you stamp on the accelerator it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve hit the Millennium Falcon&#x27;s hyperdrive.

===Awards===

The Alfa Romeo 147 won over twenty awards including:
*The European Car of the Year in 2001;
*Das Goldene Lenkrad (&quot;The golden steering wheel&quot;, BILD am SONNTAG – Germany) in 2000;
*Auto Europa 1 (Panel of engineers, drivers, and journalists headed by Auto Bild – Germany) in 2001;
*Trophées du design (&quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; – France) in 2000; and
*Carro Importado do Ano no Brasil – (Brazil Import Car of the Year) in 2002.

==Motorsport==
In Europe, there was a one-car racing series, European Alfa 147 Challenge for Alfa 147 Cup race cars starting from 2003. In 2005, this series ran alongside the World Touring Car Championship, winner of the season of 2005 was Irish driver Eoin Murray. The car used on the series was the Alfa 147 Cup producing from its straight-4 1970 cc Twin Spark engine.

An 147 2.0 TS (200 bhp) was used by Czech rally driver Martin Rada, finishing second in N3 group (21st overall) on Rally Monte Carlo in 2009, and later finishing first in group 8 on Rally Monte Carlo 2012 (42nd overall) 

The 147 also competed briefly in the British Touring Car Championship in 2001 with the JSM team, with a best finish of 3rd at Oulton Park, thanks to driver/team owner Tim Harvey. The car won the 2001, 2003 and 2004 Italian Superturismo Championship and won the Super Production class of the 2005 European Touring Car Cup with driver Lorenzo Falessi.

<text>Big Gemini (or &quot;Big G&quot;) was proposed to NASA by McDonnell Douglas in August 1969 as an advanced version of the Gemini spacecraft system (albeit actually having little in common). It was intended to provide large-capacity, all-purpose access to space, including missions that ultimately used Apollo or the Space Shuttle.

==Design==
The study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from Gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station. Land-landing at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements. Two baseline spacecraft were defined: a nine-man minimum modification version of the Gemini B called &quot;Min-Mod Big G&quot; and a 12-man advanced concept, having the same exterior geometry but with new, state-of-the-art subsystems, called &quot;Advanced Big G&quot;. Three launch vehicles-Saturn IB, Titan IIIM, and Saturn INT-20 (S-IC/S-IVB) were investigated for use with the spacecraft. The Saturn IB was discarded late in the study.

The spacecraft consisted of a crew module designed by extending the Gemini B exterior cone to a 419-cm-diameter heat shield and a cargo propulsion module. Recovery of the crew module would be effected by means of a gliding parachute (parawing). The parametric analysis and point design of the parawing were accomplished by Northrop-Ventura Company under a subcontract, and the contents of their final report were incorporated into the document. The landing attenuation of the spacecraft would be accomplished by a skid landing gear extended from the bottom of the crew module, allowing the crew to land in an upright position. The propulsion functions of transfer, rendezvous, attitude control, and retrograde would be performed by a single liquid propellant system, and launch escape would be provided by a large Apollo-type launch escape system.

In addition to the design analysis, operational support analysis and a program development plan were prepared.

The concept was given serious consideration. In 1971, faced with budget cuts which rendered the development of a fully-reusable space shuttle infeasible, NASA administrator George Low lamented that shuttle development might have to be delayed until the 1980s, with &quot;something like a &quot;big G&quot; approach and a cheap space station&quot; filling in as an interim. The Office of Management and Budget was much more favorable to the idea than NASA, concluding in a staff paper that Big Gemini launched aboard an uprated Titan III would be a more cost-effective option than any shuttle design. Ultimately OMB Deputy Director Caspar Weinberger helped to broker a compromise where Big G was taken off the table and NASA was given the greenlight for immediate development of a partially-reusable thrust-assisted orbiter shuttle.

<doc id="750550" wikidata="Q1999788" url="?curid=750550" title="Council of Piacenza">
<text>The Council of Piacenza was a mixed synod of ecclesiastics and laymen of the Roman Catholic Church, which took place from March 1 to March 7, 1095, at Piacenza.

The Council was held at the end of Pope Urban II&#x27;s tour of Italy and France, which he made to reassert his authority after the investiture controversy with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Two hundred bishops attended, as well as 4000 other church officials, and 30,000 laymen. The large number of people present required that the council had to be held outside of the city. 

==Attendants==
Among the lay attendees was Eupraxia of Kyiv, a daughter of Vsevolod I, Prince of Kyiv. She met with Urban II, and on his urgings Eupraxia made a public confession before the church council. Henry, she claimed, held her against her will, forced her into orgies, offered her to his son Conrad, and attempted to use her in a black mass. These accusations were confirmed in turn by Conrad, who stated that this was the reason he turned against his father.

Also in attendance were ambassadors from Philip I of France, who came to appeal Philip&#x27;s recent excommunication over his illegal divorce and remarriage to Bertrade de Montfort: Philip was given until Pentecost to rectify his situation. The rest of the business of the council expressed fairly typical church concerns: there were at least 15 canons published during the council, including condemnations of the Berengarian; and Nicolaitan heresies; an affirmation of transubstantiation, that is, the ;physical presence of Christ in the Eucharist; denunciations of the Antipope Clement III and his supporters; and a prohibition of payment to priests for baptisms, burials, or confirmations.

==Condemnation of simony==
One of Urban II&#x27;s greatest achievements at Piacenza was the depth of detail of his Canons, in particular Canons 1 through 7 legislating universal condemnation of &#x27;simony&#x27;: the practice of building to acquire, and acquiring via purchasing, position, or ordination, within the Church. Ecclesiastical appointments stained by simony were decreed to be invalid and powerless. However, a temperate attitude was shown to those ordained by simoniacs who were not simoniacs themselves, and had no prior knowledge that the person ordaining them had no actual ecclesiastical authority to do so. Likewise, churches purchased by parents for their children were allowed to remain within the order; as were children so-ordained, but with &quot;benefices&quot; (official financial support from Rome) removed. 

==Byzantine request==
In hindsight, the most important attendees were the ambassadors sent by Byzantine emperor Alexius I Komnenos. Alexius had been excommunicated by Gregory VII, and been through a series of reinstatements in the Church, but Urban had ultimately lifted the excommunication when he became pope in 1088, and relations between the East and West were at least temporarily friendly. The Byzantine Empire had lost much of its territory in Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks in the aftermath of the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and Alexius hoped Western knights could help him restore it. Upon hearing the Byzantine ambassadors&#x27; plea, Urban asked those present to lend aid to the Byzantine Emperor. However it is likely that Urban may have had some idea of an expedition to the East before Alexius&#x27;s request, as Gregory VII had also called twice for one, but to no avail. 

==Chronicler==
Most of the information about the Council of Piacenza comes from the chronicler Bernold of Constance, who may or may not have been present. No extant contemporary Byzantine sources felt the ambassadors were important enough to mention, although many Byzantine sources from this time no longer exist. For example, the council is mentioned by the 13th century chronicler Theodore Skoutariotes, who quotes now-lost contemporary works.

<doc id="750552" wikidata="Q293159" url="?curid=750552" title="Oscar Bonavena">
<text>Oscar Natalio &quot;Ringo&quot; Bonavena (September 25, 1942 – May 22, 1976) was an Argentine heavyweight professional boxer with a career record of 58 wins, 9 losses and 1 draw. A rugged, wild-swinging puncher, he was nicknamed &quot;Ringo&quot; because of his Beatles haircut, and enjoyed professional success in both Argentina and the United States. He is remembered for giving Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali hard fought bouts.

==Life and pro career==
Oscar Natalio Bonavena was born in Buenos Aires to Italian immigrants. He was a professional boxer, Argentine and South American champion. He also participated in several Argentine TV programs such as the Pepe Biondi Show.

== Early career==
Bonavena began his early career in New York City under the management of World War II hero and dentist Marvin Goldberg.

Following his pro debut on February 1, 1964, he racked up a quick string of early knockouts. Sometimes fighting twice a month, he lost by decision in February 1965, in only his 15th contest, to the highly rated Zora Folley. Bonavena was far too inexperienced to take on a top veteran like Folley. Three years later he won their rematch by decision.

Returning to Argentina, his winning and knockout streak continued. In mid-1966 he was enticed back to New York where the free-swinging Bonavena ran into trouble outside the ring. He called Muhammad Ali a black kangaroo, and a chicken for draft dodging. When, much later, he saw Ali seated ringside at the George Foreman–Ken Norton fight, he went over and started a big slanging match.

In his pre-fight press conference with Frazier, Bonavena needled effectively by implying that Frazier had a personal hygiene problem. He would start sniffing and grimace. Lawsuits were brought about by reporters with broken cameras; and other such &quot;colorful&quot; behavior. He was always volatile, as trainers soon discovered.

===Big name contests, Chuvalo and Frazier===
Bonavena first came to wide public attention after a fine performance: defeating rated contender and Canadian champion George Chuvalo, boxing technically better than expected, and later going the distance against the young hard-hitting great Joe Frazier. In this, their first fight, Bonavena had the future champion down twice in the second round.

===WBA elimination contests===
In 1967, after the World Boxing Association stripped Muhammad Ali of the title for refusing to be inducted into the U.S. military, Bonavena participated in that sanctioning body&#x27;s 1967 tournament to crown a new heavyweight champion. In a strong performance he decked favoured European champion Karl Mildenberger four times, winning by a decision in Frankfurt, West Germany. But he was himself knocked down twice and clearly outboxed by eventual tournament winner Jimmy Ellis in the semi-finals in Louisville, losing by unanimous decision in an upset. Many deemed it the best win of Ellis&#x27;s career.

===World Title shot, the Frazier rematch===

The following year, in 1968, after outpointing Leotis Martin, he got a rematch with Frazier for the heavyweight title in Philadelphia. After a grueling fifteen rounds Bonavena lost the rematch by decision, fighting more defensively than previous. He left with a seriously battered face, as photographed in the Ring magazine. In 1969, he got a draw in a rematch with talented Gregorio Peralta, who he&#x27;d outpointed four years earlier for the Argentine title.

===Versus Ali===
In December 1970, he fought Ali at Madison Square Garden, in the former champ&#x27;s second bout after his three-year layoff. Bonavena absorbed punishment throughout but fought well, getting through with various head and body punches. With just under 1:30 left in the 15th and final round, Ali caught Oscar rushing in and decked him with a perfectly placed left hook. Bonavena got up, but was clearly not fully recovered. Ali decked him twice more, and the fight was automatically stopped under the three knockdown rule, giving Ali a TKO (technical knockout). The ending was somewhat controversial, as Ali stood over Bonavena as Bonavena was getting up, never going to a neutral corner as the rules of boxing require, which allowed Ali to quickly knockdown Bonavena twice more and automatically end the fight. After the second knockdown, the referee appears to be attempting to guide Ali to a neutral corner, but Ali brushes the referee&#x27;s arm away and pursues a wobbly Bonavena.

===Other matches===
After the loss to Ali in 1970, he had a brutally tough match with underrated Alvin Lewis, being decked multiple times but eventually winning by disqualification. Bonavena fought intermittently for the next few years. A gregarious party man, he enjoyed life to its fullest, at the cost of his boxing career.

Eventually losses to Floyd Patterson in 1972 and Ron Lyle in 1974 effectively relegated him to lower contender status, though he did well enough in both matches. In the Patterson fight he broke his left hand early, possibly after decking Patterson in the fourth, and remained an advancing threat to the final bell. It was around 1973 that a match with a then rising Ken Norton was being planned but never materialized.

On February 26, 1976, an overweight and sluggish Bonavena fought what would be his last fight, winning a ten-round decision over the unranked Billy Joiner in Reno.

==Death==
On 22 May 1976 Bonavena was shot dead at the age of 33 by security guard Willard Ross Brymer at the Mustang Ranch brothel near Reno, Nevada, after having become involved in a conflict with its owner, Joe Conforte. His body was returned to Argentina to lie in state at the Luna Park sports arena in Buenos Aires, where 150,000 people filed by.

<text>Peter John Wagner II (born October 3, 1959) is an American actor, singer, and golfer, best known for his roles on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;.

==Early life==
Wagner was born in Washington, Missouri, to Peter John Wagner, a car salesman (died 1990), and Irene M. ( Amberg) &quot;Scotty&quot; Wagner (1920–2022), a homemaker. His only sibling, his elder brother Dennis Wagner (1953–2018), died of leukemia after a nearly two decade battle.

Raised Catholic, Wagner attended St. Gertrude&#x27;s parochial school and St. Francis Borgia Regional High School in his hometown, where he played football and basketball. He attended the University of Missouri for one year, then junior college before eventually enrolling at the University of Arizona, where he tried out for the golf team and drama department. The drama department offered him a full scholarship.

==Acting career==
Wagner first appeared on the scene in 1982 in the role of Clint Masterson, in Douglas Marland&#x27;s short-lived cable soap opera, &quot;A New Day In Eden&quot;, co-produced by Susan Flannery, who would later co-star with Wagner on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

His most famous role has been Frisco Jones on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; (1983–1987, 1989–1991, 1994–95, 2013). He was half of a supercouple (with real-life wife Kristina Wagner&#x27;s character, Felicia) and played the father of Georgie and Maxie Jones. He played Warren Lockridge on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1991 until that series&#x27; conclusion in 1993.

He appeared in several made for television films, including &quot;Lady Killer&quot; and &quot;Frequent Flyer&quot;. He appeared for many years on Aaron Spelling&#x27;s Fox nighttime soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, as the alternately caring/conniving Dr. Peter Burns (1994–99); he directed episodes as well. His character and Heather Locklear&#x27;s &quot;Amanda&quot; were featured together on a beach in the series finale&#x27;s closing scene, having faked their own deaths.
He appeared in another Aaron Spelling project, the short-lived NBC television series &quot;Titans&quot; with Yasmine Bleeth in 2000, and in Spelling&#x27;s daytime soap opera &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; (in 1997).

From 2003 to 2012, he played Nick Marone on the CBS daytime soap &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. On February 28, 2006, he and a contestant Christine Denos won $142,550 (including the standard $100,000 top prize) in the game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;; at the time, it set a single-episode largest winning record (and second largest overall) until Michelle Lowenstein surpassed said record on October 14, 2008, as the inaugural $1,000,000 winner.

In 1985, Wagner was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for &quot;Best Younger Actor&quot; for his work on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He was nominated again in 2005 for &quot;Best Lead Actor&quot; for &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

Wagner guest-starred on primetime television in notable programs such as &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, and &quot;Castle&quot;.

In January 2013, it was announced that Wagner had agreed to reprise the iconic role of Frisco Jones on &quot;General Hospital&quot; for several episodes in early 2013. Since 2014, he has played Bill Avery on &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot;. Wagner also starred on the Hallmark Channel in the &quot;Wedding March&quot; movies, with &quot;The Wedding March 3: Here Comes the Bride&quot; having premiered in February 2018 and Netflix movie &quot;Falling for Christmas&quot; in 2022.

==&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;==
In 2012, Wagner was a contestant on season 14 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Anna Trebunskaya. They were eliminated from the competition on April 3, 2012, placing 11th.

==Singing and stage career==
===Discography===
====Studio albums====
====Singles====
Although Wagner had been playing the guitar since he was 14, his initial audition for the role of Frisco Jones on &quot;General Hospital&quot; with producer Gloria Monty did not include any singing. Wagner had five auditions with ABC before ultimately winning the role of &quot;Frisco Jones&quot;. His final audition in 1983 included performing the Kenny Loggins song &quot;Wait a Little While&quot;.

ABC musical honcho Kelli Ross hooked Wagner up with Quincy Jones who oversaw his initial 5 song EP &quot;All I Need&quot;. Eventually, they would release a full ten song LP of &quot;All I Need&quot; once the song &quot;All I Need&quot; began to rise up the charts. Quincy Jones protégés Glen Ballard and Clif Magness produced Wagner&#x27;s first two albums on Qwest Records/Warner Brothers. Wagner&#x27;s singing talents led him to appearances on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot; and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;.

Eventually, his musical theater talent led to the title role(s) in a Broadway run of &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;, making him the first celebrity casting. Wagner has stated this was &quot;a role of a lifetime&quot; and performing the dual characters on Broadway was his most fulfilling professional experience. Wagner says &quot;the role I had the most fun playing, TV-wise, would be Dr. Peter Burns (Melrose Place). He was sort of an evil character who could redeem himself. Theatrically, it was when I played Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; on Broadway.&quot; He also appeared in a national theatre tour in 1987 in the role of Tony in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and a national tour of &quot;Grease&quot; in 1988.

While he toured as a rock/pop performer in concert consistently from 1985 to 1988, Wagner did not perform in the 1990s except for an occasional benefit appearance. In 2005, Wagner resumed performing in concert sporadically. His more recent concerts have included a diverse blend of songs from his own catalog, cover songs from artists such as Neil Young, Lindsey Buckingham, and Paul McCartney, and originals.

In 2012, Wagner released new music, the single &quot;Will the Rain Fall Down&quot; on iTunes. He also performed the song acoustically on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. In 2014, Wagner released the full-length release &quot;On the Porch&quot;. A notable song from this release was the fan-favorite &quot;The Right Key&quot;, which made its debut on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1989. He made a music video for &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; which premiered on YouTube.

==Personal life==
Wagner was married to actress Kristina Wagner, who played opposite him on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as his love interest Felicia Cummings. They divorced in 2006. They had two sons, born in 1990 and 1994. Their younger son Harrison died in Los Angeles on June 6, 2022, of an accidental drug overdose.

On June 13, 2022, Jack and his former wife announced a scholarship fund in honour of their son who struggled with addiction issues. All funds donated to the Harrison Wagner Scholarship Fund will be used to directly help young men pay their rent or a portion of their rent who could not otherwise afford their care at New Life House (a sober living facility in California).

Wagner began dating his &quot;Melrose Place&quot; love interest Heather Locklear in 2007; they became engaged in August 2011. The couple called off their engagement on November 15, 2011.

In May 2013, Wagner confirmed to &quot;Soaps In Depth&quot; that he and his former &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; co-star Ashley Jones had been dating for about a year. They were no longer together as of 2015.

In November 2011, Jack met his 23-year-old daughter, Kerry, for the first time at a concert in Florida. Kerry had been placed for adoption at birth by her birth mother and had recently hired a private investigator to find her biological parents. This was the subject of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;personal story&quot; in his &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; performance on April 2, 2012.

Wagner is a highly accomplished golfer and at one point considered a career in pro golf. He won the Missouri junior college championship in 1980, and is the only non-professional athlete to have won the American Century Celebrity Golf Classic, an annual competition featuring American sports and entertainment celebrities. Wagner first won the event in 2006 and repeated as champion in 2011, when he bested Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. He has a total of nineteen top ten finishes. The tournament, televised by NBC in July, is played over three rounds at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Lake Tahoe.

Wagner has a Celebrity Golf Classic named after him that raises funds for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. Wagner created the event to support the Society&#x27;s mission to cure such cancers as leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, and myeloma, and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. The Golf Classic raised more than $600,000 in its first two years to fund critical cancer research and patient services.

<doc id="750558" wikidata="Q2156104" url="?curid=750558" title="Rob Roy (novel)">
<text>Rob Roy is an 1817 historical novel by Walter Scott and is one of the Waverley novels. It is probably set in 1715, the year of the first Jacobite rising, and the social and economic background to that event are an important element in the novel, though it is not treated directly. The depiction of Rob Roy bears little relation to the historical figure: &quot;there are two Rob Roys. One lived and breathed. The other is a good story, a lively tale set in the past. Both may be accepted as ‘valid&#x27;, but they serve different needs and interests.&quot;

Frank Osbaldistone narrates the story. He is the son of an English merchant who parted from his family home in the north of England near the border with Scotland when he was a young man, being of different religion and temperament than his father or younger brother. Frank is sent by his father to live at the long unseen family home with his uncle and his male cousins, when he refuses to join his father&#x27;s successful business. In exchange, his father accepts Frank&#x27;s cousin Rashleigh to work in his business. Rashleigh is an intelligent young man, but he is unscrupulous, and he causes problems for the business of Osbaldistone and Tresham. To resolve the problems, Frank travels into Scotland and meets the larger-than-life title character, Rob Roy MacGregor.

==Composition and sources==
John Ballantyne, Scott&#x27;s literary agent, drew up a contract for &quot;Rob Roy&quot; on 5 May 1817 with Archibald Constable and Longman who had published the first three Waverley novels, the author having lost confidence in the publishers of his most recent fictional work &quot;Tales of my Landlord&quot;, John Murray and William Blackwood, who had turned out to be insufficiently committed to that project. Scott seems to have begun writing the novel immediately, but it was not completed until late December, partly because of illness.

The Rob Roy of Scott&#x27;s novel is largely fictitious, with an input from stories he had heard, handed down over the generations. As is his wont, he adjusts historical chronology freely for his narrative purposes. A number of printed sources were valuable for different components of the work. Thus, for business matters he used &quot;The Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce&quot; by Malachy Postlethwayt, of which he owned the third edition published in 1766. The depiction of Justice Inglewood and his clerk draws directly on &quot;The Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer&quot; by Richard Burn, the 13th edition of 1776 being in Scott&#x27;s library. Bailie Jarvie was suggested by another book he owned: &quot;The Highland Rogue: or, the Memorable Actions Of the Celebrated Robert Mac-gregor, Commonly called Rob-Roy&quot; [by Elias Brockett] (1723).

==Editions==
The first edition, in three volumes, dated 1818, was published in Edinburgh on 30 December 1817 by Archibald Constable and Co. and in London on 13 January 1818 by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The print run was 10,000 and the price £1 4&quot;s&quot;. Scott was involved in only two of the subsequent editions of the novel. In 1823, he made significant changes to the text for the 18-month &quot;Novels and Tales&quot;, though that was essentially a textual dead end. At the end of 1828, he revised the text for the &#x27;Magnum&#x27; edition somewhat sporadically and provided notes and a very long introduction; it appeared as Volumes 7 and 8 in December 1829 and January 1830. 

The standard modern edition by David Hewitt was published as Volume 5 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2008. This is based on the first edition with emendations principally from Scott&#x27;s manuscript; the new Magnum material is included in Volume 25a.

==Plot summary==
The story takes place just before the 1715 Jacobite Rising, with much of Scotland in turmoil. 

Frank Osbaldistone, the narrator, quarrels with his father and is sent to stay with an uncle, Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, in Northumberland. Frank falls in love with Diana Vernon, Sir Hildebrand&#x27;s niece, whose father has been forced to go into hiding because of his Jacobite sympathies. Frank&#x27;s cousin, Rashleigh, steals important documents vital to the honour and economic solvency of Frank&#x27;s father, William, and Frank pursues Rashleigh to Scotland. Several times his path crosses the mysterious and powerful figure Robert Roy MacGregor, known as Rob Roy, an associate of Diana&#x27;s uncle Sir Hildebrand. There is much confusion as the action shifts to the beautiful mountains and valleys around Loch Lomond. A British army detachment is ambushed and there is bloodshed. All Sir Hildebrand&#x27;s sons but Rashleigh are killed in the Jacobite Rising, and Rashleigh too meets a bloody end. Following this, Frank inherits Sir Hildebrand&#x27;s property and marries Diana. The plot has been criticised as disjointed. Robert Louis Stevenson, however, who loved it from childhood, regarded &quot;Rob Roy&quot; as the best novel of the greatest of all novelists. 

The novel is a brutally realistic depiction of the social conditions in Highland and Lowland Scotland in the early 18th century. The Highlanders were compared with American Indians, as regards to their primitive, isolated lifestyle. Some of the dialogue is in Scots, and the novel includes a glossary of Scottish words.

==Chapter summary==

;Volume One

Chapter 1: Frank Osbaldistone, the first-person narrator, is summoned home from France by his father to discuss his letter declining to take up his destined place in the family financial business Osbaldistone and Tresham.

Chapter 2: Despite his head clerk Owen&#x27;s best efforts on behalf of his son, Frank&#x27;s father makes plans for one of his Northumberland nephews, the sons of Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, to fill the place in the firm. He sends Frank north to assist in the procedure.

Chapter 3: On the road, Frank encounters a traveller (who is later identified as Morris) with a particularly heavy portmanteau and teases him by encouraging his fears that he might be intending to rob him.

Chapter 4: The travellers are joined in the inn at Darlington by a Scottish gentleman called Campbell (later identified as Rob Roy) with a shrewd manner of speaking as he declines to accompany Morris as a protector.

Chapter 5: Approaching Osbaldistone Hall, Frank encounters his spirited cousin, Die, out hunting; they ride together to the hall.

Chapter 6: At dinner, Die comments caustically on five of her surviving cousins and tells Frank that the sixth, Rashleigh, is to leave home for a career with Osbaldistone and Tresham. Escaping from the circulating bottle, Frank encounters the gardener, Andrew Fairservice, who expresses his disapproval of the family&#x27;s Roman Catholicism and Jacobitism.

Chapter 7: Die tells Frank that Morris, who is a government agent, has alleged before the local justice of the peace, Squire Inglewood, that Frank has robbed him of money and dispatches. Die advises Frank to flee to Scotland, but he insists on appearing before Inglewood.

Chapter 8: Arriving at Inglewood-Place, Frank and Die encounter Rashleigh who claims to have been putting in a word for Frank. The hearing before the incompetent Inglewood and his clerk, Jobson, descends into farce.

Chapter 9: Campbell arrives to testify that he was present at the robbery and that Frank was not involved. Frank and Die plan a meeting with Rashleigh.

Chapter 10: Die introduces Frank to the library, her sanctuary. Rashleigh arrives and gives an explanation of how he had persuaded Campbell to testify in Frank&#x27;s behalf. Over coffee and cards, Frank finds Rashleigh fascinating.

Chapter 11: During a boring Sunday at Osbaldistone Hall, Rashleigh tells Frank that, following a decree by her late father, Die is destined to marry Thorncliffe, the second oldest of the brothers, or to enter a cloister. Frank is unconvinced by Rashleigh&#x27;s assertion that he is only a friend of Die&#x27;s.

Chapter 12: Frank gets drunk at dinner and assaults Rashleigh. The next morning, Sir Hildebrand smooths the matter over.

Chapter 13: Die tells Frank of Rashleigh&#x27;s improper advances towards her as her tutor. Rashleigh leaves for London and Frank writes a warning letter to Owen before taking over the role of tutor.

;Volume Two

Chapter 1 (14): Fairservice tells of news conveyed by a pedlar of concern in Parliament about the theft of Morris&#x27;s portmanteau. Frank sees two figures from a distance in the library window. 

Chapter 2 (15): Frank suspects that his letter to Owen has not arrived. Fairservice suggests that the second person in the library was probably the Roman Catholic priest, Fr Vaughan.

Chapter 3 (16): Die advises Frank to go to London, where Rashleigh has been put in charge and will further his own ambitions. Frank confesses his love for her, but she rejects him, citing her dedication to the cloister.

Chapter 4 (17): Frank surprises Die in the library, having learned that Fr Vaughan is away from the area, but she is alone and proves evasive. She asks that they continue as friends and hands him a letter from his father&#x27;s partner, Tresham, announcing that Rashleigh has left for Scotland with large bills payable to individuals there. Frank resolves to go to Glasgow to investigate.

Chapter 5 (18): Fairservice offers to accompany Frank as his servant, and they leave for Glasgow.

Chapter 6 (19): After disposing of a horse stolen by Fairservice, Frank and his servant arrive in Glasgow and approach the cathedral.

Chapter 7 (20): Frank and Fairservice attend a service in the cathedral&#x27;s Laigh Kirk, during which Frank receives a whispered warning with a summons to meet the speaker on the bridge.

Chapter 8 (21): After overhearing Fairservice talking about him in unflattering terms to an acquaintance, Frank meets his summoner, Campbell (Rob Roy), on the bridge and is conducted to the tolbooth. They are admitted by Dougal Gregor and Rob identifies himself in Gaelic.

Chapter 9 (22): Frank finds Owen in the tolbooth, committed at the behest of a firm which had worked closely with Osbaldistone and Tresham until made aware of its problems. Bailie Nicol Jarvie arrives and agrees to stand surety for Owen&#x27;s appearance.

Chapter 10 (23): Jarvie and Rob, who are cousins, engage in good-natured verbal sparring. After receiving a letter from Die, Rob indicates that if Frank and Jarvie come to see him in the glens he may be able to help with the problem created by Rashleigh, the bills falling due in ten days&#x27; time. Jarvie takes Frank to his house.

Chapter 11 (24): Fairservice persuades Frank to continue to employ him. Jarvie suggests expedients for Owen to adopt in the meantime.

Chapter 12 (25): Frank encounters Rashleigh in the College-yards and Rob interrupts a duel between them. 

Chapter 13 (26): Jarvie fills Frank and Owen in on Rob&#x27;s background and Rashleigh&#x27;s likely aim of fomenting Jacobitism in the Highlands.

;Volume Three

Chapter 1 (27): As they journey towards the Highlands, Jarvie advises Frank and Fairservice how to conduct themselves.

Chapter 2 (28): At the inn known as the Clachan of Aberfoil, the travellers become involved in a skirmish with two Highlanders who are in possession. A third Highlander, Dougal Gregor, fights on Jarvie&#x27;s behalf until the Lowlander, Duncan Galbraith of Garschattachin, intervenes to calm things down.

Chapter 3 (29): Frank receives a letter from Rob postponing their meeting, and Fairservice is worried about becoming involved with him. Jarvie defends Rob against the opposition of the two Highlanders, now identified as Inverashalloch and Allan Stuart of Inverach, and Galbraith. An English officer arrives with a body of infantry to arrest a couple, whom he takes Frank and Jarvie to be, for correspondence with the outlawed Rob.

Chapter 4 (30): Guided reluctantly by Dougal, who has been captured, the infantry party is routed by Highlanders under Rob&#x27;s wife, Helen.

Chapter 5 (31): The survivors of the skirmish are brought before Helen whose sons, James and Robert, arrive and announce that Rob has been taken captive by Galbraith with his Lennox militia. Helen orders that Morris, who had been kept by her sons as a hostage for Rob&#x27;s safety, be drowned.

Chapter 6 (32): Frank carries a defiant message from Helen to the Duke (unidentified in the fiction) who holds Rob, but the Duke declines to release him. After news is received that his Highland allies have deserted him, the Duke interviews Rob.

Chapter 7 (33): Rob escapes on the march. Frank, accused of helping him, flees and receives a packet containing Rashleigh&#x27;s bills from Die, whom he encounters in company with an unknown gentleman.

Chapter 8 (34): After Die and the gentleman have left, Frank is joined by Rob who indicates that she is now united with &#x27;his Excellency&#x27;. They rejoin the clan and Rob, after indignantly rejecting Jarvie&#x27;s offer to oversee his sons as apprentice weavers, repays a substantial loan from his cousin.

Chapter 9 (35): Rob expresses to Frank his conflicted feelings about his sons&#x27; futures. The next morning, on the road, he defends his clan&#x27;s behaviour and indicates that Rashleigh has switched to the government side. Helen hands Frank a ring as a parting gift from Die.

Chapter 10 (36): Frank and Jarvie leave the Highlands for Glasgow, where Frank is reunited with his father and business matters are sorted.

Chapter 11 (37): The 1715 rebellion breaks out and Frank and his father return to London. Five of Sir Hildebrand&#x27;s six surviving sons die in rapid succession, followed by their father. Frank goes north to take possession of Osbaldistone Hall and learns from Inglewood that Die&#x27;s companion was actually her father, Sir Frederick, who had been publicly declared dead.

Chapter 12 (38): Frank is joined in the library by Die and her father, who are fugitives from the government, but their presence is carelessly divulged by Fairservice to Clerk Jobson&#x27;s spy.

Chapter 13 (39): During the night, government officials arrive at the Hall. Die and her father attempt to escape but are captured by Rashleigh. As the prisoners are removed, Rashleigh is run through by Rob and expires laying a curse on his patrimony. The Vernons leave for France where Sir Frederick dies, leaving Die free to return to Britain and marry Frank who lived happily with her until her eventual death.

==Historical setting==
The story takes place just before the Jacobite rising of 1715, with much of Scotland in turmoil. A British army detachment is ambushed and there is bloodshed. The eponymous Rob Roy is badly wounded at the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719, in which a British army of Scots and English defeat a Jacobite and Spanish expedition that aimed to restore the Stuart monarchy.

==Literary and cultural setting at time of publication==
&quot;Rob Roy&quot; was written at a time when many Europeans started regretting colonialism and imperialism, as reports circulated back of horrendous atrocities towards indigenous cultures. It was also a time when debates raged about the slave trade, the working class started to demand representation, and, more relevant to the novel, the disastrous effect of the Highland Clearances. During this era, William Wordsworth wrote &quot;The Conventions of Cintra&quot;, praising Spanish and Portuguese resistance to Napoleonic forces; Lord Byron would go on to praise Amazonian women in &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, inverting the &quot;polite&quot; norms of femininity that the modern &quot;civilized&quot; world placed on them; and, finally, Scott would write about similar events in &quot;The Vision of Don Roderick&quot;. The term &quot;guerrilla&quot; came about during this period due to the influence of the Peninsular War.

==Reception==
&quot;Rob Roy&quot; met with a generally enthusiastic reception from the reviewers. Only three (&quot;The Anti-Unionist&quot;, &quot;The British Critic&quot;, and &quot;The Theatrical Inquisitor&quot;), were predominantly hostile. The characters were generally admired, though a degree of caricature was sometimes detected; several reviewers pointed out that some of them bore a distinct resemblance to characters in the preceding novels (Die to Flora in &quot;Waverley&quot;, Helen to Meg Merilees in &quot;Guy Mannering&quot;, and Fairservice to Dandie Dinmont in &quot;Guy Mannering&quot; and Cuddie Headrigg in &quot;Old Mortality&quot;) but they mostly noted significant variations which meant they were not mere repetitions. Although one or two reviewers were surprised by the failure of Rob to live up to his prominence in the title, he was generally judged a success. The Highland landscape descriptions and striking individual scenes also attracted much praise. Most reviewers found the story rather weak, as usual with this author, with improbable coincidences and a hurried conclusion.

==Adaptations==
Although there have been several heavily fictionalised feature films featuring a heroic Robert Roy MacGregor over the years, none of them to date has been directly adapted from Walter Scott&#x27;s novel, in which MacGregor plays a lesser role than Osbaldistone. For example, although a 1995 film is based on the same eponymous hero, &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, starring Liam Neeson, Tim Roth, and Jessica Lange, it has no other connection with the novel. The same is true of the 1953 film &quot;Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue&quot;. 

In 1960, the Gateway Theatre in Edinburgh presented a musical adaptation of Scott&#x27;s novel by Robert Kemp, with songs by Ian Robertson.

==Beverages==
*A brand of blended whisky, Bailie Nicol Jarvie, is named after a character from the book.
*The Rob Roy cocktail is similar to a Manhattan cocktail. It first appeared in New York City around 1890.

<doc id="750560" wikidata="Q403416" url="?curid=750560" title="Battle of Pliska">
<text>The Battle of Pliska or Battle of Vărbitsa Pass was a series of battles between troops, gathered from all parts of the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Nicephorus I, and the First Bulgarian Empire, governed by Khan Krum. The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital Pliska which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the Balkan Mountains that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkans, most probably the Vărbitsa Pass. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of ambush and surprise night attacks to effectively trap and immobilize the Byzantine army, thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased the skull of Nicephorus in silver, and used it as a cup for drinking. This is one of the most documented instances of the custom of the skull cup.

The Battle of Pliska was one of the worst defeats in Byzantine history. It deterred Byzantine rulers from sending their troops north of the Balkans for more than 150 years afterwards, which increased the influence and spread of the Bulgarians to the west and south of the Balkan Peninsula, resulting in a great territorial enlargement of the First Bulgarian Empire.

== Initial campaigns ==

When Nicephorus became emperor in 802, he planned to reincorporate Bulgar-held territory back into the empire. In 807 he launched a campaign but only reached Adrianople and achieved nothing because of a conspiracy in his capital. That attempted attack, however, gave reason for the Bulgar Khan, Krum, to undertake military operations against the Byzantine Empire. The main objective was an extension to the south and south-west. The next year, a Bulgar army penetrated the Struma Valley and defeated the Byzantines. The Bulgar troops captured 1,100 &quot;litres&quot; (roughly 332 to 348 kilograms) of gold and killed many enemy soldiers including all &quot;strategoi&quot; and most of the commanders. In 809, Krum personally besieged the fortress of Serdica and seized the city, killing the entire garrison of 6,000.

== Preparation for an invasion ==
In 811, Nicephorus organized a large force in an attempt to conquer Bulgaria once and for all. The army included forces from the Anatolian and European &quot;themata&quot;, and the Imperial Bodyguard (the &quot;tagmata&quot;). In addition, the army was joined by a number of irregular troops who expected a swift victory and the chance to plunder. The conquest was supposed to be easy, and many high-ranking officials and aristocrats accompanied Nicephorus, including his son Stauracius and his brother-in-law Michael I Rangabe. The entire army consisted of approximately 22,000 soldiers.

== Sack of Pliska ==
The army first assembled in May and by 10 July had established a camp at the fortress of Marcelae (present-day Karnobat) near the Bulgarian frontier. Nicephorus intended to confuse the Bulgarians, and over the next ten days, made several feigned attacks. Krum assessed the situation, estimated that he could not repulse an army of such size and offered peace, which Nicephorus haughtily rejected. Theophanes wrote that the Emperor &quot;was deterred from his own ill thoughts and the suggestions of his advisors who were thinking like him.&quot; Some of his military chiefs considered the invasion of Bulgaria to be imprudent, but Nicephorus was confident of his ultimate success.

Nicephorus moved ahead, invaded the Bulgarian lands, and marched through the Balkan passes towards the capital of Pliska. On 20 July Nicephorus divided the army into three columns, each marching by a different route towards Pliska. They met little resistance. After three days the Byzantines reached Pliska, defended by 12,000 elite Bulgarian soldiers. The Byzantines defeated the Bulgarian defenders and an additional Bulgarian army of 15,000 which was hastily assembled. On 23 July, the Byzantines quickly entered the defenseless capital sacking the city and the surrounding countryside. Krum attempted once again to negotiate a peace. According to the historian Theophanes, Krum&#x27;s proclamation stated, &quot;Here you are, you have won. So take what you please and go with peace.&quot; Nicephorus, overconfident from his success, ignored him believing that all of Bulgaria could be conquered.

Michael the Syrian, patriarch of the Syrian Jacobites in the twelfth century, described in his Chronicle the brutalities and atrocities of Nicephorus&#x27;s troops: &quot;Nicephorus, emperor of the Romans, walked in the Bulgarians&#x27; land: he was victorious and killed a great number of them. He reached their capital, took it over, and devastated it. His savagery went to such a point that he had their small children brought out, tied to the ground, and crushed with millstones. The Byzantine soldiers looted and plundered; burnt down the unharvested fields, cut the tendons of the oxen, slaughtered sheep and pigs.&quot; The Emperor took over Krum&#x27;s treasury, locked it and did not allow his troops to reach it.

== Battle ==

While Nicephorus and his army were busy plundering the Bulgarian capital, Krum mobilized his people (including women and Avar mercenaries) to set traps and ambushes in the mountain passes. The Hungarians also supported the Bulgarians in the effort against the Byzantines. Initially Nicephorus intended to march through Moesia and reach Serdica before returning to Constantinople but the news of these preparations for a battle changed his decision and he chose the shortest way to his capital. The overconfident Emperor neglected to scout ahead and on 25 July the Byzantine army entered the Vărbitsa Pass. The Byzantine cavalry, however, told Nicephorus that the road was barred with wooden walls and that Krum&#x27;s forces watched from the surrounding heights. The Emperor became panicked by the situation and repeatedly stated to his companions &quot;Even if we have had wings we could not have escaped from peril.&quot; Before they could retreat, the Bulgars blocked the valley entrance.

Nicephorus, unwilling to consider an assault on the palisades, simply set up camp, despite his generals&#x27; misgivings. From the heights, the Bulgarian troops began an effort to taunt and unsettle the Byzantine forces by means of banging their shields. After three days, the morale of the Byzantine troops was shattered. That evening, the Bulgarians assembled their troops and tightened the belt around their trapped enemy. At dawn, the Bulgarians rushed down the hills killing the panicked and confused Byzantines. The Byzantine Imperial Bodyguard was the first to be attacked. The Byzantines fruitlessly resisted for a short time and perished. Upon seeing their comrades&#x27; fate, the other units broke and ran.

As the Byzantines fled to the south, they came upon a muddy river that was difficult to cross. Unable to quickly ford the river, many of the Byzantines including mounted forces fell into the water and became stuck in the mud. As additional waves of panicked and fleeing soldiers arrived at the river, they trampled and killed many of their compatriots. The river became filled with so many dead that the pursuing Bulgarians easily passed over the dead and continued to hunt down and attack the Byzantines.

Those Byzantines who made it across the river were later confronted by high moated wooden walls constructed by the Bulgarians to impede the pathways to the south. The Byzantines attempted to climb over the wall and many were partially successful only to suffer injuries and death in the process. The Byzantines attempted to burn the walls but this tactic also proved ineffective and resulted in additional casualties. Almost all the fleeing Byzantines perished, some were killed by the sword; others drowned in the river; and many were mortally injured at the walls.

== Aftermath ==
Reportedly, few Byzantines survived the defeat. Among the nobles killed were the patricians Theodosios Salibaras and Sisinnios Triphyllios; the &quot;strategos&quot; of the Anatolics Romanos and the &quot;strategos&quot; of Thrace; as well as the commanders of the Excubitors and Vigla &quot;tagmata&quot;. The most notable person to be killed, however, was Emperor Nicephorus, who according to historians died on a dunghill on the day of the battle. Nicephorus&#x27;s son, Stauracius, was carried to safety by the Imperial bodyguard after receiving a paralyzing wound to his neck. Six months later, his wounds eventually killed him. According to tradition, Krum had the Emperor&#x27;s head put on a spike, lined the skull with silver, and used it as a drinking cup.

<doc id="750570" wikidata="Q1243780" url="?curid=750570" title="Dorchester on Thames">
<text>Dorchester on Thames (or Dorchester-on-Thames) is a village and civil parish in Oxfordshire, about northwest of Wallingford and southeast of Oxford. The town is a few hundred yards from the confluence of the River Thames and River Thame. A common practice of the scholars at Oxford was to refer to the river Thames by two separate names, with Dorchester on Thames the point of change. Downstream of the village, the river continued to be named &quot;The Thames&quot;, while upstream it was named The Isis. Ordnance Survey maps continued the practice by labelling the river as &quot;River Thames or Isis&quot; above Dorchester, however, this distinction is rarely made outside the city of Oxford.

==Etymology==
The town shares its name with Dorchester in Dorset, but there has been no proven link between the two names. The name is likely a combination of a Celtic or Pre-Celtic element &quot;-Dor&quot; with the common suffixation &quot;Chester&quot; (Old English: &quot;A Roman town or Fort&quot;). As Dorchester on Thames is surrounded on three sides by water (and may have been founded at the point where the river became navigable), it is likely the name is linked to the Celtic word for water &quot;&quot;dwfr&quot; (or &quot;dŵr&quot; as in modern Modern Welsh), giving a meaning of &quot;Fort on the Water&quot; or &quot;Water-town&quot;&quot;. This etymology was known as early as 1545 when it was used by John Leland in his epic poem &quot;Cygnea Cantio&quot; (&quot;Song of the Swan&quot;). In the poem Leland refers to the town with a Greek translation, &quot;Hydropolis&quot; ( &quot;Water-city&quot;). There is no surviving record of the settlement&#x27;s Latin name, and Bede&#x27;s reference to the town as &quot;Dorcic&quot; is otherwise unsupported.

==History==
The area has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic. In the north of the parish there was a Neolithic sacred site, now largely destroyed by gravel pits. On one of the Sinodun Hills on the opposite side of the Thames, a ramparted settlement was inhabited during the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Two of the Sinodun Hills bear distinctive landmarks of mature trees called Wittenham Clumps. Adjacent to the village is Dyke Hills which is the remains of an Iron Age hill fort. The Romans built a &quot;vicus&quot; here, with a road linking the settlement to a military camp at Alchester, 16 miles (25 km) to the north.

In 634 Pope Honorius I sent a bishop called Birinus to convert the Saxons of the Thames Valley to Christianity. King Cynegils of Wessex gave Dorchester to Birinus as the seat of a new Diocese of Dorchester under a Bishop of Dorchester; the diocese was extremely large, and covered most of Wessex and Mercia. The settled nature of the bishopric made Dorchester in a sense the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Wessex, which was later to become the dominant kingdom in England. Eventually Winchester displaced it, with the bishopric being transferred there in 660. 

Briefly in the late 670s Dorchester was once more a bishop&#x27;s seat under Mercian control. Dorchester again became the seat of a bishop in around 875, when the Mercian Bishop of Leicester transferred his seat there. The diocese merged with that of Lindsey in 971; the bishop&#x27;s seat was moved to Lincoln in 1085. In the 12th century the church, then Dorchester Abbey, was enlarged to serve a community of Augustinian canons. King Henry VIII dissolved the Abbey in 1536, leaving the small village with a huge parish church.

Since 1939 the title of Bishop of Dorchester was revived as a Suffragan Bishop in the Diocese of Oxford.

==Amenities==

Dorchester Abbey is both the village&#x27;s Church of England parish church and its main tourist attraction. The Abbey has a museum. Of the ten original coaching inns, two remain: The George and The White Hart. The George has a galleried yard dating back to 1495 and it used to serve coaches on the Gloucester-Oxford-London route. The George was used as a filming location for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; in the episode &quot;Taken at the Flood&quot; in 2006.
Bishop&#x27;s Court Farm offers alpaca walking, a cafe, a livery, mooring on the Thames, as well as lambing events in the spring.
==Festivals and events==
Dorchester on Thames is the home of a number of annual events:
* The biennial Dorchester on Thames Festival, a 10-day fundraising event held every other May
* The English Music Festival holds its primary concerts at Dorchester Abbey

Nearby is Day&#x27;s Lock on the Thames, where an annual &quot;World Poohsticks Championship&quot; is held.

==Notable people==
* Robert Brydges Addison (1854–1920) – composer, choirmaster and teacher
* Jonty Hearnden – auctioneer, antiques expert and television presenter
* Mark Wright – footballer and former England captain

<doc id="750573" wikidata="Q975213" url="?curid=750573" title="Mercedes-Benz SL-Class">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class (marketed as [[Mercedes-AMG SL-Class (R232)|Mercedes-AMG SL]] since 2022) is a grand touring sports car manufactured by Mercedes-Benz since 1954. The designation &quot;SL&quot; derives from the German term &quot;&quot;Sport-Leicht&quot;,&quot; which translates to &quot;Sport Light&quot; in English.

Initially, the first 300 SL was a racing sports car built in 1952 
with no intention of developing a street version. In 1954, an American importer Max Hoffman suggested the street version of 300 SL for the wealthy performance car enthusiasts in the United States where the market for the personal luxury car was booming after the Second World War.

==Abbreviation of SL==
Whether the abbreviation &quot;SL&quot; was derived from a 1931 Mercedes-Benz SSKL (Super Sport Kurz Leicht—Super Sport Short Light) isn&#x27;t known. At the public introduction of 300 SL in 1952, Mercedes-Benz did not define the abbreviation &quot;SL&quot;.

The German magazine, , declared in its 2012 special edition issue of Mercedes-Benz SL that Rudolf Uhlenhaut—in his notarised letter—indicated the abbreviation meant &quot;Super Leicht&quot;. This contradicted with the abbreviation proposed by Engelen, Riedner, and Seufert who worked with Rudolf Uhlenhaut: they indicated the abbreviation means &quot;Sport Leicht&quot;. On 15 March 2021, published a photocopy of an undated &quot;Informations-Unterlage&quot; (press release) from 1952 in its issue, showing the definition of &quot;SL&quot; as &quot;super-leicht&quot;.

Mercedes-Benz used &quot;Sport Leicht&quot; and &quot;Super Leicht&quot; interchangeably until 2017 when a chance discovery in its corporate archive clarified the abbreviation stood for &quot;Super Leicht&quot;.

According to the German definition, &quot;Leicht&quot; means &quot;light&quot; (as in weight, amount, and feeling, for instance) or &quot;easy&quot; (as in little effort). For this abbreviation in English language, the definition &quot;light&quot; is used.

==W198 and W121 (1954–1963)==
The 300 SL was a road-going version of the W198 racing car with extensive modifications to the body. The 300 SL in coupé form was introduced in 1954, featuring its trademark gullwing doors. In 1957, the roadster succeeded the coupé and had the larger conventional passenger doors and larger form-fitting headlamps and was in production until 1963.

In 1955, the smaller 190 SL presented an attractive, more affordable alternative to the exclusive Mercedes-Benz 300 SL, sharing its basic styling, engineering, detailing, and fully independent suspension. Both cars had double wishbones in front and swing axles at the rear. Instead of the 300 SL&#x27;s expensive purpose-built W198 tubular spaceframe, the 190 SL used a shortened unitary floorpan modified from the W121 base saloon. A 1.9-litre four-cylinder in-line engine was used instead of the 300 SL&#x27;s engine.

Both the 300 SL roadster and 190 SL have a soft fabric folding top and an optional removable hardtop. The production for 300 SL and 190 SL ended in 1963 with the introduction of the W113 SL-Class.

===Model range===
*300 SL (Gullwing): 1954–1957, 3.0 L I6
*300 SL (Roadster): 1957–1963, 3.0 L I6
*190 SL: 1955–1963, 1.9 L I4


==W113 (1963–1971)==


Replacing both the 300 SL and 190 SL, the 230 SL was introduced in 1963 with a distinctive concave roofline that earned the nickname &quot;pagoda top&quot;. The W113 featured a low waistline, large curved greenhouse windows, detachtable hardtop, and a new 2.3-litre straight-six engine.

For 1967, the engine was enlarged to 2.5 litres, and 230 SL was renamed as 250 SL. The changes were made to the interior with new dashboard padding, switches and knobs, steering wheel, and door pockets (US model only). The wheel covers fitted to 250 SL and 280 SL replaced the smaller hubcaps. A year later in 1968, the engine was enlarged again to 2.8 litres, and the 250 SL was changed to 280 SL.

===Model range===
*230 SL: 1963–1967, 2.3 L I6

==R107 (1971–1989)==

In 1971, R107 was introduced with new design language and safety features that spread to the subsequent Mercedes-Benz models. For the first time, the V8 engines were fitted to the SL-Class. With the production from 1971 to 1989, R107 was one of few longest-produced vehicles from Mercedes-Benz. R107 received a very minor update in 1972 with new rubber-edged wing mirrors from W116 and a major update in 1985 for 1986 model year. The engine options were updated in 1980 for the 1981 model year with new aluminium V8 engines from W126 S-Class introduced in 1979 while the 2.8-litre six-cylinder in-line engine carried over. It was updated again in 1985 for the 1986 model year with new 3.0-litre six-cylinder in-line engine from W124 and enlarged 4.2- and 5.5-litre V8 engines while the 5.0-litre V8 engine carried over.

The SLC Coupe is much rarer, produced from 1971 – 1981, as 280, 350, 380 and 450 SLC. With the 450 SLC, 450 SLC 5.0 and 500 SLC models, Daimler-Benz took part in major rallies at the end of the 1970s such as the 30,000 km long Vuelta à la America del Sud (1977), the Safari Rally (1979) and the Bandama Rally.

The R107 received its first update in 1985 with deeper front air dam, revised brake system with larger discs and four piston calipers, driver&#x27;s side airbag (standard for US market and extra-cost option for the European market), and, for the European market, catalysator option. The 5-mph bumpers and four round sealed-beam headlamps fitted to the US models remained unchanged despite the revised US FMVSS regulations that allowed the 2.5-mph bumpers and form-fitting headlamps, starting with 1982 and 1983 model years respectively. The US model received the third brake lamp mounted on the trunk in 1986.

The 560 SL was sold in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia only.

==R129 (1988–2001)==

The R129 was introduced in 1989 as a two-passenger convertible with a removable hardtop — the first Mercedes to feature a fully automatic, hydraulically-operated fabric convertible top; V8 and (later) V12 engines with four valves per cylinder; projector lens HID headlamps (introduced in 1995); and an automatic rollbar, which self-deployed in a rollover event. The retractable rollbar could also be raised or lowered manually using a switch on the console, and facilitated occupant safety without compromising aesthetics. In 1992, R129 was the first SL-Class to offer an optional a V12 engine (600 SL/SL 600) and to have official AMG variants (500 SL 6.0 AMG, SL 60 AMG (V8), SL 70 AMG (V12), SL 73 AMG (V12), and then SL 55 AMG (V8)). The R129 was the last SL-Class offered with a manual gearbox.

For the US market, R129 was the first SL-Class offered with six-cylinder in-line engine from 300 SL-24 (named as 300SL) since the 1971. For 1995, a larger 3.2-litre engine was introduced in the SL 320, subsequently dropped from the US market in 1998. 

The 1994 R129 introduced a minor cosmetic and technical updates; revised engine optionals; as well as a new nomenclature. The 3.0-litre in-line six engines, initially fitted with 12-valve (300 SL) and 24-valve (300 SL-24) heads, was revised to one engine in two displacements (2.8 and 3.2 litres) with both utilizing a 24-valve head. The V8 and V12 were carried over with no changes. 300 SL and 300 SL-24 became SL 280 and SL 320 while 500 SL and 600 SL were renamed as SL 500 and SL 600.

In 1998, R129 received the major cosmetic and technical updates with revised engines to include the V6, V8, and V12 engines from the new W220 S-Class. All of those updated engines had three valves and two spark plugs per cylinder.

==R230 (2000–2011)==

The R230, introduced in 2001, continues the evolution of R129 with smoother body design and new peanut-shaped headlamp design. The fifth-generation SL-Class featured a &#x27;Vario Roof&#x27; retractable hardtop, as introduced on the 1996 SLK Class: Active Body Control (ABC) active suspension system, Keyless Go keyless entry and smart key, and Sensotronic Brake Control (SBC) electro-hydraulic power brake system. The SBC proved troublesome, and was later disabled by Mercedes-Benz in a large recall campaign due to the difficulties in modulating the brake effort.

In 2006, R230 received a minor cosmetic update and revised engine options. 

The R230 SL underwent a significant facelift in 2008 featuring new and revised engines and a new front end that evokes the classic 300 SL with a large grille featuring a prominent 3-pointed star and twin &quot;power domes&quot; on the bonnet, the car also features new headlights with an optional &quot;Intelligent Light System&quot; and a new speed sensitive steering system. The SL 63 AMG replaced the SL 55 AMG. A high-performance version of R230, SL 65 AMG Black Series, was offered as a coupe only body type. A total of 169,433 SL R230s were ever produced. The most common model is SL500 (~100,000 units). The rarest is SL65 AMG with only 3,055 units (350 of which SL65 AMG Black Series).

== R231 (2011–2020) ==

Mercedes-Benz launched the sixth generation SL, internally designated R231, at the North American International Auto Show in January 2012. The R231 introduced aluminum bodywork, its weight advantage offset by higher safety and convenience equipment.

New features included a system marketed as &#x27;FrontBass&#x27;, which used space in the aluminium structure ahead of the front footwells as resonance spaces for the bass loudspeakers. Additionally, standard equipment included an adaptive windscreen wipe/wash system which supplied fluid from the wiper blade itself, as needed and depending on the direction of wipe. The R231 was available with two suspension systems: semi-active adjustable damping as standard and active suspension system ABC (Active Body Control) as an extra-cost option. Both types featured electro-mechanical, speed-sensitive power steering, which allowed the variable steering ratio across the steering wheel angle.

The R231 was longer and wider than its predecessor. Shoulder room is increased by and elbow room .

A mid-cycle update was introduced in 2016 for the 2017 model year along with revised engine and transmission options. A 9G-TRONIC Plus 9-speed automatic transmission was fitted to the SL-Class for the first time (SL 400/SL 450 and SL 500) while AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT and AMG SPEEDSHIFT Plus 7G-TRONIC 7-speed automatic transmissions for SL 63 AMG and SL 65 AMG respectively remained unchanged. SL 350 was renamed as SL 400 (SL 450 for the North American market).

R231 had a revised front end, front grille treatment, and larger non-functional side &#x27;vents&#x27; behind the front wheels. It also received adaptive LED front headlights with integrated daytime running lights and turn signals, leaving the below-bumper intake area free from lighting. The LED tail lights received single-colour red lenses (for North American market) or red-and-amber lenses (for the European and international markets) instead of the red and white lenses of the pre-facelift models.

A slight revision to the folding &#x27;Vario-roof&#x27; hardtop meant it could deploy at up to without the luggage compartment partition having to be deployed in a separate manual operation.

== R232 (2022–present) ==


The seventh generation of the SL-Class was presented in October 2021. The R232 is confirmed to be an AMG model only, designating it as Mercedes-AMG SL-Class. There are three powertrains, the entry-level powertrain being a 2.0L I4 mild hybrid engine found in the SL 43, producing 280 kW (375 hp). Two of the powertrains are 4.0L V8 Biturbo gasoline engines, with the SL 55 developing a maximum of &amp; , and the SL 63 developing a maximum of &amp; . Both versions are available only with all-wheel-drive, a first for the SL-Class. The R232 is reverting to the soft fabric roof rather than the heavier retractable hardtop that was fitted to the R230 and R231.

This generation is the first SL-Class to have the 2+2 seating configuration as standard rather than optional fitment since 1989 with the introduction of R129. While R107 was built to be two-seater convertible, the owners could opt for the 2+2 seating configuration when ordering their R107 or for the retrofit kit to be installed in their R107 at later date. The rear seats are optimal for the passengers whose height is up to 1.5 metres.

The dashboard is symmetrical along with the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and an 11.9-inch touchscreen panel in the centre. The instrument cluster is placed within a binnacle as to reduce the reflections from the sunlight and improve the legibility when the roof is folded down. The touchscreen panel in the centre is electrically tiltable to the vertical position for the same reason.

<doc id="750577" wikidata="Q1849828" url="?curid=750577" title="Muramasa">
<text>, commonly known as , was a famous swordsmith who founded the Muramasa school and lived during the Muromachi period (14th to 16th centuries) in Kuwana, Ise Province, Japan (current Kuwana, Mie).

In spite of their original reputation as fine blades favored by the shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu and his vassals, the katana swords made by Muramasa gradually became a symbol of the anti-Tokugawa movement. Furthermore, in lore and popular culture from the 18th century, the swords have been regarded as .

== Work ==
=== Style ===
Much like his unique reputation, Muramasa is known for some fairly unusual features in his work. These attributes are often called by terms prefixed with &quot;Muramasa&quot;.
* —The first particular characteristic of his is the frequent use of a wave-shaped hamon. The of Muramasa is categorized as , that is, it forms randomized wave-like shapes. In particular, Muramasa&#x27;s has very long, shallow valleys between a cluster of shapes. Furthermore, the front pattern and the back one often coincide well. In regards to &quot;hataraki&quot;, or metallurgical patterns created through the differential heating and quenching process, his hamon are extremely clear cut with defined nioi. Muramasa&#x27;s hamon are also known to be near exact symmetrical duplicates of one another, said to be extremely intricate and difficult in the process of the hamon creation process.
* —The other easily identifiable feature one will see on Muramasa blades is the fish-belly (tanagobara) shape of the nakago. in the 19th century often simulated this style.

=== Notable works ===
Although the school of Muramasa is extremely famous in popular culture, none of their swords are designated as a National Treasure or an Important Cultural Property.

 is the only sword officially designated as an &quot;&quot;.
Katana, length 66.4 cm, curvature 1.5 cm, bottom width 2.8 cm, , , and (see also Glossary of Japanese swords).
The front side contains a sign of Muramasa and a mantra sign (a mantra from Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō or the Lotus Sutra of Nichiren Buddhism).
The back side contains a year sign 永正十年葵酉十月十三日 (13th day of the 10th month of Eishō 10, that is, 10th of November, 1513). It is highly probable that the date was chosen because the high priest Nichiren died on the 13th day of the 10th month of Kōan 5 (1282).
Both sides contain beautiful engravings of Kurikara (Fudō Myō-ō&#x27;s mythological sword empowered by a burning dragon).
The style of the engravings is similar to those of the swordsmith Heianjō Nagayoshi, so some scholars suggest Muramasa studied under Nagayoshi.
It is also silver-damascened with characters , which suggests that the sword was once in possession of Nabeshima Katsushige (1580–1657), the first daimyō lord of Saga Domain.
Later, this sword was given to Katsushige&#x27;s son Nabeshima Motoshige, the first lord of Ogi Domain, and has been inherited by his successors.

Muramasa&#x27;s students made excellent weapons too. Fujiwara Masazane, a disciple of Muramasa, forged Tonbokiri, one of the Three Great Spears of Japan.
Masazane also forged a sword called whose name came from a legend that Sakai Tadatsugu killed a wild boar with this sword when accompanying Ieyasu in hunting.

== In history ==
=== Origin ===
The exact origin of the Muramasa school is unknown.
The oldest extant sword equipped with both a name sign Muramasa and a date sign shows the year Bunki 1 (1501).
Scholars, however, assert several swords signed with Muramasa (but without year signs) are slightly older than 1501 in light of their styles.
It is generally thought that the school of Muramasa spanned at least three generations.
It is hardly clear when the school disappeared, but some Muramasa swords contain the year sign Kanbun (1661–1673).

Lores in the late Muromachi period (early 16th century–1573) stated that Muramasa I was a student of Masamune (c. 1300), the greatest swordsmith in Japan&#x27;s history, and the Hon&#x27;ami family (family dynasty of swordpolishers and sword connoisseurs) commented that his floruit was the Jōji era (1362–1368). 
Scholars from the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1600) to modern days, however, have dismissed the relationship of Masamune and Muramasa as fantasy because all of extant Muramasa swords are too new to support this theory.
Another theory states that Muramasa I was a student of Heianjō Nagayoshi, a prominent Kyoto swordsmith known for spears and engravings.
The school of , a notable branch of the Muramasa school, records Masashige I died in 1456, so Muramasa I was active before 1456 if we believe the record.

, the epithet of Muramasa, is also covered with myths.
A common belief states Muramasa I was born in a place called Sengo, but there is no such a place near Kuwana in reality.
Another popular legend says the mother of Muramasa I worshipped the bodhisattva Senju Kannon and thus he was called Sengo, a shortened form of .

Kanzan Sato claims that the starting year of Muramasa I was Entoku and Meiō (1489–1501), that of Muramasa II was Tenbun (1532–1539), and that of Muramasa III was Tenshō (1573–1591).
On the other hand, Suiken Fukunaga considers the floruit of Muramasa I was around Shōchō (1428–1429) and the 1501 sword was forged by Muramasa III.

=== Relationship to the Tokugawa dynasty ===
Because of their exquisite sharpness, Muramasa swords were favored especially by the samurai of Mikawa (led by Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate, and his ancestors).
Naturally, when a misfortune happens in the Tokugawa clan, it is often related to Muramasa, definitely not because they are &quot;cursed,&quot; but simply because most Mikawa samurai used these swords.
Matsudaira Kiyoyasu, a grandfather of Ieyasu, was mistakenly killed by his own vassal Abe Masatoyo with a Muramasa.
Ieyasu&#x27;s father Matsudaira Hirotada was also stabbed with a Muramasa by Iwamatsu Hachiya, who lost his mind by excessive drinking.
When Ieyasu&#x27;s first son Matsudaira Nobuyasu was forced to commit suicide (&quot;seppuku&quot;), his beheader (&quot;kaishakunin&quot;) Amagata Michitsuna used a Muramasa.

In spite of these unfortunate incidents, Tokugawa Ieyasu and his generation seemed to greatly appreciate Muramasa weapons.
Ieyasu himself owned two swords forged by Muramasa and left them to his family; as of 2013, the Owari-Tokugawa family still holds one of the two as an heirloom.
Honda Tadakatsu, one of the Four Greatest Generals under Ieyasu, wielded Tonbogiri, a legendary spear forged by Fujiwara Masazane, who studied under the Muramasa school.
Sakai Tadatsugu, another of the Four, wielded Inoshishi-giri, a sword forged by Masazane.

Later generations in the shogunate, however, gradually came to think of Muramasa as sinister items.
Arai Hakuseki, the official scholar-bureaucrat of the shogunate, commented &quot;Muramasa is associated with not a few sinister events.&quot;
Even &quot;&quot; (1849), the official history book published from the shogunate, cites , which tells a legend that Ieyasu regarded Muramasa as cursed items and banned them from his family, although it is clearly a fabricated story considering the heirloom of the Owari-Tokugawa family.

In the Bakumatsu period (1853–1868), Muramasa was somehow considered to be a curse bringer against the shogunate, and thus shishi (anti-Tokugawa activists) wished to acquire Muramasa blades.
Even though the school of Muramasa does not have an exalted or prestigious status to be used by the imperial family in ordinary times, a Muramasa was wielded by Prince Arisugawa Taruhito, the commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army against the Tokugawa shogunate during the Boshin War (1868–1869).
To satisfy growing demand, forgeries of Muramasa blades were also often made in this period.

== Cultural significance ==
In popular culture, Muramasa swords have been often depicted as cursed swords with demonic powers. Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook said that Muramasa &quot;was a most skillful smith but a violent and ill-balanced mind verging on madness, that was supposed to have passed into his blades. They were popularly believed to hunger for blood and to impel their warrior to commit murder or suicide.&quot;
It has also been told that once drawn, a Muramasa blade has to draw blood before it can be returned to its scabbard, even to the point of forcing its wielder to wound himself or commit suicide. 
Thus, it is thought of as a demonic cursed blade that creates bloodlust in those who wield it.
These images date back to
kabuki dramas in the 18–19th century such as
 (1781),
&quot; (1860),
 (1880),
and &quot; (1888).

When was driven mad because of power harassment from his superiors and killed them in Edo Castle in the 6th year of Bunsei (1823), townspeople rumored that Geki used a Muramasa, although actually the sword had no sign and there was no evidence to support the rumor.
This incident shows how great the influence of kabuki dramas upon common people was.

<doc id="750580" wikidata="Q1084304" url="?curid=750580" title="Violet (Peanuts)">
<text>Violet Gray is a fictional character featured in the long-running syndicated daily and Sunday comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;, created by Charles M. Schulz. Violet first appeared in the February 7, 1951 strip. She was originally a major character, until she was eventually relegated to background and cameo appearances as other female characters became more prominent, with Lucy ultimately taking over most of Violet&#x27;s character traits.

Violet is best known as a bit of a snob who likes bragging and, along with her best friends Lucy and Patty, often teases and torments Charlie Brown. She bullies other characters in the strip, particularly &quot;Pig-Pen&quot;.

In addition to the comic strip, Violet has appeared alongside other &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters in numerous &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials, cinematic movies, theatrical plays, and video games.

== History ==
Violet first appeared in the February 7, 1951 &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip. She became the strip&#x27;s fifth character: up to that point, Charlie Brown, Shermy, Patty and Snoopy had been the only four characters seen in the then four-month-old strip. From there on, Violet&#x27;s character changed and developed until the 1960s, when she began to be seen less often than the other major characters, with her appearances eventually reduced to the background and cameos. Her last appearance was in the November 27, 1997 &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip.

== Appearance ==
As Violet&#x27;s character developed over the years, her appearance changed as well. In the early strips, Violet has her shoulder-length black hair kept in either pigtails, a bun, or, sometimes, a ponytail. Later on, Schulz dropped the braids and kept Violet&#x27;s hair only in ponytails. Violet also wears front bangs and often wears dresses which are originally depicted as purple; later they were depicted as lime green, as well as black Mary Janes shoes. Violet wears her purple dress in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, which is consistent with her name.

== Personality ==
Violet is smart, popular, tomboyish, and somewhat of a snob. She makes her opinions known to everyone, and her haughtiness causes her to often torment other people, whom she views as beneath her.

Compared to the apparent middle-class upbringing of the other characters, Violet is supposedly of upper-class mentality, and she likes to brag about how her father possesses something her friends&#x27; fathers don&#x27;t; it is also implied, however, that Violet&#x27;s father is often absent from her life, which her peers use against her when she gets too obnoxious. For example, in a Father&#x27;s Day strip, her boasts are quelled by Charlie Brown when he takes her to his dad&#x27;s barbershop. After telling her about how his dad would always smile at him no matter how bad a workday he was having, a moved and humbled Violet walked away, but not before quietly wishing Charlie Brown a Happy Father&#x27;s Day. In another example, a character named &quot;5&quot; fired back at her with &quot;&quot;My&quot; dad goes to PTA meetings!&quot; Charlie Brown once deflated her with the comeback: &quot;&quot;My&quot; dad has a &quot;son&quot;.&quot;

In the early strips, Violet often acted like a preschool-age Suzy Homemaker: frequently making mud pies, playing &quot;house,&quot; and being linked to romantic scenarios involving Shermy or Charlie Brown. In a strip from 1954, she is shown to collect stamps as a hobby. On some occasions, Violet was shown walking and keeping company with Lucy.

Her surname (Gray) was mentioned only once, on April 4, 1953.

Violet&#x27;s personality was much more forceful and recognizable compared to the more generic early &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters like Patty and Shermy, which allowed her to survive slightly longer than those founding characters when a new wave of characters, Linus, Lucy, and Schroeder, were introduced (as an example, Violet has key roles in the TV specials &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot;). By the 1960s, however, Violet, too, was largely phased out with the introduction of the next wave of characters (Peppermint Patty, Marcie, Franklin and such). Schulz admitted in a 1988 interview that Violet&#x27;s pure vindictiveness had made it difficult to give her punch lines. Speaking of her, Patty and Shermy: &quot;Some characters just don&#x27;t seem to have enough personality to carry out ideas. They&#x27;re just almost born straight men.&quot; Schulz also contrasted Violet to Lucy in that where Violet was purely mean, Lucy had redeeming characteristics of being bluntly honest and to-the-point, and thus Lucy &quot;worked&quot; as a more rounded character where Violet did not. Violet&#x27;s use in the strip was eventually reduced to appearances in the background.

<doc id="750582" wikidata="Q57641" url="?curid=750582" title="Viktor Orbán">
<text>Viktor Mihály Orbán (; born 31 May 1963) is a Hungarian lawyer and politician who has been Prime Minister of Hungary since 2010, previously holding the office from 1998 to 2002. He has also led the Fidesz political party since 2003, and previously from 1993 to 2000. He was re-elected as prime minister in 2014, 2018, and 2022. On 29 November 2020, he became the country&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister.

Orbán was first elected to the National Assembly in 1990 and led Fidesz&#x27;s parliamentary group until 1993. During his first term as prime minister and head of the conservative coalition government, from 1998 to 2002, inflation and the fiscal deficit shrank, and Hungary joined NATO. After losing reelection, however, Orbán led the opposition party from 2002 to 2010.

Since 2010, when he resumed office, his policies have undermined democracy, weakened judicial independence, increased corruption, and curtailed press freedom in Hungary. During his second premiership, several controversial constitutional and legislative reforms were made, including the 2013 amendments to the Constitution of Hungary. He frequently styles himself as a defender of Christian values in the face of the European Union, which he claims is anti-nationalist and anti-Christian. His portrayal of the EU as a political foe—as he accepts its money and funnels it to his allies and relatives—has led to accusations that his government is a kleptocracy. It has also been characterized as a hybrid regime, dominant-party system, and mafia state.

Orbán defends his policies as &quot;illiberal Christian democracy.&quot; As a result, Fidesz was suspended from the European People&#x27;s Party from March 2019. In March 2021, Fidesz left the EPP over a dispute over new rule-of-law language in the latter&#x27;s bylaws. While shifting Hungary&#x27;s towards what he has called &quot;illiberal democracy,&quot; he has also promoted Euroscepticism, opposition to liberal democracy and establishment of closer ties with China and Russia.

==Early life and background (1963–1988)==
Orbán, who was born in 1963, has two younger brothers, both businessmen, Győző Jr. (born in 1965) and Áron (born in 1977). Their paternal grandfather, Mihály Orbán, a former dockworker and a war veteran, farmed and worked as a veterinary assistant in Alcsútdoboz in Fejér County, where Orbán first lived while growing up. Then, the family moved in 1973 to neighboring Felcsút, where Orbán&#x27;s father headed the machinery department at the local farm collective. Orbán attended school there and in Vértesacsa. In 1977, the family moved to Székesfehérvár, where Orbán had secured a place at the prestigious Blanka Teleki school. In his first two years there, he served as local secretary of the Hungarian Young Communist League (KISZ), in which membership was mandatory for matriculation to a university, Also, his father happened to be a patron of the KISZ.

After graduating from high school in 1981, Orbán completed his military service alongside Lajos Simicska, whom he had befriended in high school. Orbán was jailed several times for indiscipline, which included a failure to appear for duty during the 1982 FIFA World Cup and striking a non-commissioned officer during a personal altercation. His time in the army also coincided with the declaration of martial law in Poland in December 1981, which his friend Simicska criticized. During that period, Orbán recalled, he expected to be mobilized to invade Poland. He would later remark that military service had shifted his political views radically from the previous position of a &quot;naive and devoted supporter&quot; of the Communist regime. Nonetheless, a state security report from May 1982 still described him as &quot;loyal to our social system&quot;.

In 1983, Orbán went to study law at the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. There, he joined &quot;Jogász Társadalomtudományi Szakkollégium&quot; (Lawyers&#x27; Special College of Social Sciences), a residential college—established in 1983 by István Stumpf and modeled on English universities—for law students from outside the capital. Its members were permitted to explore social sciences beyond the socialist canon and the &quot;new&quot; field of &quot;bourgeois&quot; political science, in particular. There, Orbán met Gábor Fodor and László Kövér. 

Orbán became chairman of the executive committee of the college&#x27;s 60 students in 1984. He also went on a series of trips to Poland with his classmates and lecturer Tamás Fellegi in during the 1984–1985 school year and again in 1987, during the third pastoral visit of John Paul II. Their lead Polish contacts were Małgorzata Tarasiewicz and Adam Jagusiak, who would become members of the anti-Communist student movement , beginning 1985.

In 1986, Orbán submitted his master&#x27;s thesis on the Polish Solidarity movement, based on interviews with its leaders. That August, shortly before his marriage to Dr Anikó Lévai in Szolnok, in September 1986, a police source reported him as affiliated with an organization whose members were lecturing in the United States and West Germany, presenting themselves as &quot;the country&#x27;s expected future leaders.&quot; They received Western support while also enjoying full protection by the Budapest police () and insider access to top-level government decisions through minister Horváth. The minister was expected to intervene personally to clear Orbán, in particular, of any sedition charges. 

After obtaining the higher degree of Juris Doctor in 1987, Orbán lived in Szolnok for two years, commuting to his job in Budapest as a sociologist at the Management Training Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. In November 1987, at the Lawyers&#x27; Special College of Social Sciences, Orbán welcomed a group of 150 delegates from 17 countries to a two-day seminar—backed by the European Network for East–West Dialogue—on the Perestroika, conscientious objection, and the prospects for a pan-European democratic movement.

In September 1989, Orbán took up a research fellowship at Pembroke College, Oxford, funded by the Soros Foundation which had employed him part-time since April 1988. He began work on the concept of civil society in European political thought, under the guidance of Zbigniew Pełczyński. During this time, he unsuccessfully contested the Fidesz leadership elections in Budapest, which he had lost to Fodor. In January 1990, he abandoned his project at Oxford and returned to Hungary with his family to run for a seat in Hungary&#x27;s first post-communist parliament.

==Political ascent (1988–1998)==

On 30 March 1988, at the Lawyers&#x27; Special College of Social Sciences, Orbán–alongside Stumpf, Fodor, Kövér and 32 other students and activists–founded the Alliance of Young Democrats (&quot;Fiatal Demokraták Szövetsége&quot;, FIDESZ), a liberal-nationalist youth movement conceived as an overt political challenge to the Hungarian Young Communist League, whose members were banned from participation. The college journal &quot;Századvég&quot; (&quot;End of the Century&quot;), established with Orbán&#x27;s help and funded by George Soros since 1985, now became the press organ of Fidesz.

On 16 June 1989, Orbán gave a speech in Heroes&#x27; Square, Budapest, on the occasion of the reburial of Imre Nagy and other national martyrs of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. In his speech, he demanded free elections and the withdrawal of Soviet troops which brought him to national prominence and announced the existence of Fidesz. In the summer of 1989, he took part in the opposition round table talks, representing Fidesz alongside László Kövér. Fidesz became a political party in October 1989.

On returning home from Oxford, he secured the first spot on the Fidesz candidate list ahead of Fodor and was elected Member of Parliament from Pest County at the April 1990 election. He was appointed leader of the Fidesz&#x27;s parliamentary group, in this capacity until May 1993.
On 18 April 1993, Orbán became the first president of Fidesz, replacing the national board that had served as a collective leadership since its founding. Under his leadership, Fidesz gradually transformed from a radical liberal student organization to a center-right people&#x27;s party.

The conservative turn caused a severe split in the membership. Several members left the party, including Péter Molnár, Gábor Fodor and Zsuzsanna Szelényi. Fodor and others later joined the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), initially a strong ally of Fidesz, but later a political opponent.

During the 1994 parliamentary election, Fidesz barely reached the 5% threshold. Orbán became MP from his party&#x27;s Fejér County Regional List. He was chairman of the Committee on European Integration Affairs between 1994 and 1998. He was also a member of the Immunity, Incompatibility and Credentials Committee for a short time in 1995. Under his presidency, Fidesz adopted &quot;Hungarian Civic Party&quot; (&quot;Magyar Polgári Párt&quot;) to its shortened name in 1995. His party gradually became dominant in the right-wing of the political spectrum, while the former ruling conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) had lost much of its support. From April 1996, Orbán was chairman of the Hungarian National Committee of the New Atlantic Initiative (NAI).

In September 1992, Orbán was elected vice chairman of the Liberal International. In November 2000, however, Fidesz left the Liberal International and joined the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). During the time, Orbán worked hard to unite the center-right liberal conservative parties in Hungary. At the EPP&#x27;s Congress in Estoril in October 2002, he was elected vice-president, an office he held until 2012.

==First premiership (1998–2002)==
In 1998, Orbán formed a coalition with the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) and the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party (FKGP). The coalition won the 1998 parliamentary elections with 42% of the national vote. Orbán became the second youngest prime minister of Hungary at the age of 35 (after András Hegedüs) and the first post-Cold War head of government in both eastern and central Europe who had not previously been a member of a communist party during the Soviet-era.

In February, the government decided that plenary sessions of the Hungarian Parliament would be held only every third week. Opposition parties strongly opposed the change, arguing that it would reduce parliament&#x27;s legislative efficiency and ability to supervise the government. In March, the government also tried to replace the National Assembly rule that requires a two-thirds majority vote with one of a simple majority, but the Constitutional Court ruled this unconstitutional.

Two of Orbán&#x27;s state secretaries in the prime minister&#x27;s office had to resign in May, due to their implication in a bribery scandal involving the American military manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corporation. Before bids on a major jet-fighter contract, the two secretaries, along with 32 other deputies of Orbán&#x27;s party, had sent a letter to two US senators to lobby for the appointment of a Budapest-based Lockheed manager to be the US ambassador to Hungary. The government was also involved in a lengthy dispute with Budapest City Council the national government&#x27;s decision in late 1998 to cancel two major urban projects: the construction of a new national theatre.

Relations between the Fidesz-led coalition government and the opposition worsened in the National Assembly, where the two seemed to have abandoned all attempts at consensus-seeking politics. The government pushed to swiftly replace the heads of key institutions (such as the Hungarian National Bank chairman, the Budapest City Chief Prosecutor and the Hungarian Radio) with partisan figures. Although the opposition resisted, for example by delaying their appointing of members of the supervising boards, the government ran the institutions without the stipulated number of directors. In a similar vein, Orbán failed to show up for question time in parliament for periods of up to 10 months. His statements, such as &quot;The parliament works without opposition too...&quot;, also contributed to the image of arrogant and aggressive governance.

A later report in March by the Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists criticized the Hungarian government for improper political influence in the media, as the country&#x27;s public service broadcaster teetered close to bankruptcy. Numerous political scandals during 2001 led to &quot;a de facto&quot;, if not actual, breakup of the coalition that held power in Budapest. A bribery scandal in February triggered a wave of allegations and several prosecutions against the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party. The affair resulted in the ousting of József Torgyán from both the FKGP presidency and the top post in the Ministry of Agriculture. The FKGP disintegrated and more than a dozen of its MPs joined the government faction.

===Economy===

Orbán&#x27;s economic policy was aimed at cutting taxes and social insurance contributions, while reducing inflation and unemployment. Among the new government&#x27;s first measures was to abolish university tuition fees and reintroduce universal maternity benefits. The government announced its intention to continue the Socialist–Liberal stabilization program and pledged to narrow the budget deficit, which had grown to 4.5% of GDP. 

Economic successes included a drop in inflation from 15% in 1998 to 7.8% in 2001. Annual GDP growth rates were fairly steady under Orbán&#x27;s tenure, ranging from 3.8% to 5.2%. The fiscal deficit fell from 3.9% in 1999 to 3.4% in 2001 and the ratio of the national debt decreased to 54% of GDP. 

===Foreign policy===

In March 1999, after Russian objections were overruled, Hungary joined NATO along with the Czech Republic and Poland. The Hungarian membership to NATO demanded its involvement in Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&#x27;s Kosovo crisis and modernization of its army. NATO membership also dealt a blow to the economy because of a trade embargo imposed on Yugoslavia.

Hungary attracted international media attention in 1999 for passing the &quot;status law&quot; concerning estimated three-million ethnic Hungarian minorities in neighbouring Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The law aimed to provide education, health benefits and employment rights to members of those minorities, and was said to heal the negative effects of the disastrous 1920 Trianon Treaty.

Governments in neighbouring states, particularly Romania, claimed to be insulted by the law, which they saw as interference in their domestic affairs. Proponents of the status law countered that several of the countries criticizing the law themselves had similar constructs to provide benefits for their own minorities. Romania acquiesced after amendments following a December 2001 agreement between Orbán and Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Năstase; Slovakia accepted the law after further concessions made by the new government after the 2002 elections.

==Leader of the Opposition (2002–2010)==
The level of public support for political parties generally stagnated, even with general elections coming in 2002. Fidesz and the main opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) ran neck to neck according to opinion polls for most of the year, both attracting about 26% of the electorate. According to a September 2001 poll by the Gallup organization, however, support for a joint Fidesz – Hungarian Democratic Forum party list would have support from up to 33% of the voters, with the Socialists drawing 28% and other opposition parties 3% each. 

In the event, Orbán&#x27;s group lost the April parliamentary elections to the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party, which set up a coalition with its longtime ally, the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats. Turnout was a record-high 70.5%. Beyond these parties, only deputies of the Hungarian Democratic Forum made it into the National Assembly. The populist Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party and the right Hungarian Justice and Life Party lost all their seats. Thus, the number of political parties in the new assembly was reduced from six to four.

MIÉP challenged the government&#x27;s legitimacy, demanded a recount, complained of election fraud, and generally kept the country in election mode until the October municipal elections. The socialist-controlled Central Elections Committee ruled that a recount was unnecessary, a position supported by observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, whose only substantive criticism of the election conduct was that the state television carried a consistent bias in favour of Fidesz.

In the 2004 European Parliament election, the ruling Hungarian Socialist Party was heavily defeated by the opposition conservative Fidesz. Fidesz gained 47.4% of the vote and 12 of Hungary&#x27;s 24 seats.

Orbán was the Fidesz candidate for the parliamentary election in 2006. Fidesz and its new-old candidate failed again to gain a majority in this election, which initially put Orbán&#x27;s future political career as the leader of Fidesz in question. However, after fighting with the Socialist-Liberal coalition, Orbán&#x27;s position resolidified, and he was elected president of Fidesz for yet another term in May 2007.

On 1 November, Orbán and his party announced their plans to stage several large-scale demonstrations across Hungary on the anniversary of the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Revolution. The events were intended to serve as a memorial to the victims of the Soviet invasion and a protest against police brutality during the 23 October unrest in Budapest. Planned events included a candlelight vigil march across Budapest. However, the demonstrations were small and petered out by the end of the year.

On 1 October 2006, Fidesz won the municipal elections, which counterbalanced the MSZP-led government&#x27;s power to some extent. Fidesz won 15 of 23 mayoralties in Hungary&#x27;s largest cities—although it narrowly lost Budapest to the Liberal Party—and majorities in 18 of 20 regional assemblies.

On 9 March 2008, a national referendum took place on revoking government reforms which introduced doctor fees per visit and medical fees paid per number of days spent in hospital as well as tuition fees in higher education. Fidesz initiated the referendum against the ruling MSZP. The procedure for the referendum started on 23 October 2006, when Orbán announced they would hand in seven questions to the National Electorate Office, three of which (on abolishing copayments, daily fees and college tuition fees) were officially approved on 17 December 2007 and called on 24 January 2008. The referendum passed, a significant victory for Fidesz.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, Fidesz won by a large margin, garnering 56.36% of votes and 14 of Hungary&#x27;s 22 seats.

==Second premiership (2010–present)==

===Second Orbán government (2010–2014)===
In the 2010 parliamentary elections, Orbán&#x27;s party won 52.7% of the popular vote but received a 68% majority of parliamentary seats due to the design of the post-communist electoral system. A two-third parliamentary majority is enough to change the constitution, and in 2011 Orbán&#x27;s government drafted a new constitution behind closed doors, debated it for only nine days in the parliament and passed it on a party line. Orbán rejected suggestions within his party to pursue a more cautious agenda. He would go on to amend the constitution twelve times in his first year in office. Among other changes, it includes support for traditional values, nationalism, references to Christianity, and a controversial electoral reform, which decreased the number of seats in the Parliament of Hungary from 386 to 199. The new constitution entered into force on 1 January 2012, replacing the Hungarian Constitution of 1949.

In 2012 Orbán&#x27;s government implemented a flat tax on personal income set at 16%. Orbán has called his government &quot;pragmatic&quot;, citing restrictions on early retirement in the police force and military, making welfare more transparent, and a central banking law that &quot;gives Hungary more independence from the European Central Bank&quot;.

On 14 January 2014 Orbán went to Moscow in order to sign with Vladimir Putin an agreement on the Paks II nuclear power plant (NPP). The Russian state-owned enterprise Rosatom would develop the NPP, and Hungary was to finance the plant by borrowing from Russia. At the same time Orbán reassured everyone that the South Stream pipeline would be completed soon. The &quot;BBC&quot; complained that &quot;there was no formal bidding process for the plant&#x27;s expansion, and the terms of the loan agreement have not yet been made public,&quot; even after the Hungarian parliament approved the deal on 6 February. It later came to light that the loan amounted to €8bn and was financed over a 30 year term. Hungarian MFA Peter Szijjarto told reporters that the deal was &quot;the business (transaction) of the century.&quot; Westinghouse and Areva, two Western prime contractors, had been lured since 2012 by the Hungarian civil service but eventually had been frozen out of competition by the Orbán government, who chose to sole-source the deal.

===Third Orbán government (2014–2018)===

After the April 2014 parliamentary election, Fidesz won a majority, garnering 133 of the 199 seats in the National Assembly. While Orbán&#x27;s party won a large majority, it received 44.5% of the national vote, 8.7% less than in 2010.

In a speech in July 2014 in Băile Tușnad, a remote village in Romania, at the Bálványos Free Summer University and Student Camp Orbán first publicly articulated an ideology of illiberalism. He described the Western 2007–2008 financial crisis as a paradigm shift of the international order, comparable with the two world wars and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Orbán described his current mission: &quot;while breaking with the [liberal] dogmas and ideologies that have been adopted by the West and keeping ourselves independent from them, we are trying to find the form of community organisation, the new Hungarian state, which is capable of making our community competitive in the great global race for decades to come.&quot;

In November 2014 Orbán proposed a controversial &quot;internet tax&quot; amid accusations of corruption. That same year there were numerous protests against his government, including one in Budapest in November 2014 against the proposed &quot;internet tax&quot;.

During the 2015 European migrant crisis, Orbán ordered the erection of the Hungary–Serbia barrier to block entry of illegal immigrants so that Hungary could register all the migrants arriving from Serbia, which is the country&#x27;s responsibility under the Dublin Regulation, a European Union law. Under Orbán, Hungary took numerous actions to combat illegal immigration and reduce refugee levels. In May 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled against Hungary&#x27;s policy of migrant transit zones, which Orbán subsequently abolished while also tightening the country&#x27;s asylum rules.

As other Visegrád Group leaders, Orbán opposes any compulsory EU long-term quota on redistribution of migrants. According to him, Turkey should be considered a safe third country for unwanted immigrants or refugees.

In 2015 Orbán wrote in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;: &quot;Europe&#x27;s response is madness. We must acknowledge that the European Union&#x27;s misguided immigration policy is responsible for this situation.&quot; He also demanded an official EU list of &quot;safe countries&quot; to which migrants can be returned.

He proposed 6 points to the European Union to tackle the crisis:

# Joint surveillance of Greek borders to prevent migration from continuing illegally
# The separation of refugees and economic immigrants prior to their entrance to the Schengen area
# All EU Member States and countries it judges to be as such should be considered Safe States (a state which complies with the 1951 Refugee Convention) to be able to accept refugees on paper.
# Every member should increase their contributions by at least 1% and reduce their expenditure by 1%. This would raise €3 billion for crisis management and refugee aid.
# Work with Ankara and Moscow to manage the wave [coming from Syria] (This was also approved by D.C.)
# The creation of a world quota (not obliging but) calling on all developed countries to accept refugees on a proportional basis.

All but one of these points were voted through by the Parliament in the September of 2015 (the surveillance of the archipelago was left to the Greek military).

===Fourth Orbán government (2018–2022)===

In the April 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election, the Fidesz–KDNP alliance was victorious and preserved its two-thirds majority, with Orbán remaining prime minister. Orbán and Fidesz campaigned primarily on the issues of immigration and foreign meddling, and the election outcome was seen as a victory for right-wing populism in Europe.

In a 2018 speech at the meeting of a municipal association, Orbán said &quot;We must state that we do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed: we do not want our own colour, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others. We do not want this. We do not want that at all. We do not want to be a diverse country.&quot;

On 30 March 2020, the Hungarian parliament voted 137 to 53 in favor of passing legislation that would create a state of emergency without a time limit, grant the prime minister the ability to rule by decree, suspend by-elections, and introduce the possibility of prison sentences for spreading fake news and sanctions for leaving quarantine. Two and a half months later, on 16 June 2020, the Hungarian parliament passed a bill that ended the state of emergency effective 19 June. However, on the same day the parliament passed a new law removing the requirement of parliamentary approval for future &quot;medical&quot; states of emergencies, allowing the government to declare them by decree.

In 2021, the parliament transferred control of 11 state universities to foundations led by allies of Orbán. The Mathias Corvinus Collegium, a residential college, received an influx of government funds and assets equal to about 1% of Hungary&#x27;s gross domestic product, reportedly as part of a mission to train future conservative intellectuals.

Due to a combination of unfavourable conditions, which involved soaring demand of natural gas, its diminished supply from Russia and Norway to the European markets, and less power generation by renewable energy sources such as wind, water and solar energy, Europe faced steep increases in energy prices in 2021. In October 2021, Orbán blamed a record-breaking surge in energy prices on the European Commission&#x27;s Green Deal plans.
Despite the anti-immigration rhetoric from Orbán, Hungary increased the immigration of foreign workers into the country as of 2019 to address a labor shortage.

In February 2020, Orbán was interviewed by Christopher DeMuth at the National Conservatism Conference in Rome.

In July 2020, Orbán expressed that he still expects arguments over linking of disbursement of funds of the European Union to rule-of-law criteria but remarked in a state radio interview that they &quot;didn&#x27;t win the war, we (they) won an important battle&quot;. In August 2020, Orbán whilst speaking at an event to inaugurate a monument commemorating the Treaty of Trianon, said Central European nations should come together to preserve their Christian roots as western Europe experiments with same-sex families, immigration and atheism.

In a 2021 speech, Orbán said &quot;The challenge with Bosnia is how to integrate a country with 2 million Muslims.&quot; Bosnian leaders responded by calling for Orbán&#x27;s visit to Sarajevo to be cancelled. The head of the country&#x27;s Islamic Community, Husein Kavazović, characterized his statement as &quot;xenophobic and racist&quot;.

===Fifth Orbán government (2022–present)===

In the April 2022 parliamentary election, Fidesz won a majority, garnering 135 of the 199 seats in the National Assembly. While Orbán&#x27;s close ties with Moscow raised concerns, core Fidesz voters were persuaded that mending ties with the EU might also lead Hungary into war. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe dispatched a full-scale monitoring mission for the election. Orbán declared victory on Sunday night, with partial results showing his Fidesz party leading the vote by a wide margin. Addressing his supporters after the partial results, Orbán said: &quot;We won a victory so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels.&quot; Opposition leader Péter Márki-Zay admitted defeat shortly after Orbán&#x27;s speech.

In May 2022, Orbán promoted the Great Replacement conspiracy theory in a speech.

In July 2022, Orbán – repeating the thesis of Jean Raspail – spoke in Romania against the &quot;mixing&quot; of European and non-European races, adding &quot;We [Hungarians] are not a mixed race and we do not want to become a mixed race.&quot; In Vienna two days later, he clarified that he was talking about cultures and not about race.

In July 2024 Zelensky decided to shut down the overland pipeline transfer of petroleum products from Russia to Hungary. Orbán and his government protested this event strenuously. When Croatia suggested that Hungary could use the Adria pipeline, Orbán refused, and his foreign minister said that it was unreliable.

In October 2024, as the Premier of Hungary was invited to address the European Parliament as part of Hungary&#x27;s six-month presidency of the European Council. Peter Magyar, Manfred Weber, Valerie Hayer, and Moritz Koerner amongst others lined up to berate him. During the European Parliament session, Ursula von der Leyen criticized Orbán, accusing him of failing to support Ukraine and mismanaging Hungary&#x27;s economy. She highlighted the contrast between Orbán&#x27;s current stance and the bravery of Hungarian freedom fighters in 1956, questioning the rationale of blaming Ukraine for the war. Additionally, MEP Péter Magyar criticized Orbán&#x27;s government for corruption and declining living standards.

=== Foreign policy ===

Orbán attended the inauguration ceremonies of re-elected Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Ankara in 2018 and 2023. In October 2018, Orbán said after talks with President Erdoğan in Budapest that &quot;A stable Turkish government and a stable Turkey are a precondition for Hungary not to be endangered in any way due to overland migration.&quot;

In June 2019, Orbán met Myanmar&#x27;s State Counsellor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. They discussed bilateral ties and illegal migration.

==== China ====

Orbán has maintained close ties with China throughout his tenure, and his administration is generally seen as China&#x27;s closest ally in the EU. Hungary joined China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2015, while in April 2019, Orbán attended a BRI forum in Beijing, where he met the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He spearheaded plans to open a Fudan University campus in Budapest, which led to pushback in Hungary. He met with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo member and top diplomat Wang Yi in Budapest on 20 February 2023; he afterwards backed the peace plan released by Wang Yi concerning Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==== Russia and Ukraine ====

Orbán questioned Nord Stream II, a new Russia–Germany natural gas pipeline. He said he wants to hear a &quot;reasonable argument why South Stream was bad and Nord Stream is not&quot;. &quot;South Stream&quot; refers to the Balkan pipeline cancelled by Russia in December 2014 after obstacles from the EU.

Since 2017, Hungary&#x27;s relations with Ukraine rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine. Orbán and his cabinet ministers repeatedly criticized Ukraine&#x27;s 2017 education law, which makes Ukrainian the only language of education in state schools, and threatened to block further Ukraine&#x27;s EU integration until it is modified or repealed. (The language law was amended in December 2023 in favor of official languages of the European Union, including Hungarian.)

Orbán has displayed an ambivalent attitude towards Russia and Vladimir Putin, especially following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. He has described the war as &quot;clear aggression&quot; by Russia, saying a sovereign Ukraine is needed &quot;to stop Russia posing a threat to the security of Europe&quot;. However, conversely, he has also criticised the European Union for &quot;prolonging the war&quot; in Ukraine by sanctioning Russia and sending weapons and money to Ukraine instead of encouraging a negotiated peace, and has been accused of blocking aid to Ukraine. Consequently Austro-Hungarian journalist Paul Lendvai called Orbán &quot;Divider of Europe&quot;.

Amidst the 2021-2022 Ukraine crisis, Orbán was the first EU leader to meet with Vladimir Putin in Moscow in a visit he called &quot;a peacekeeping mission&quot;. They also discussed Russian gas exports to Hungary. On 2 March, as Russia had already launched an invasion of Ukraine, Orbán decided to welcome Ukrainian refugees to Hungary, and will support the Ukrainian membership to the European Union. Initially, Orbán condemned Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine and said Hungary would not veto EU sanctions against Russia. However, Orbán rejected sanctions on Russian energy, due to Hungary&#x27;s excessive dependency (85%) on Russian fossil fuels. In late March 2022, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky singled out Orbán for his lack of support for Ukraine. In June, Zelensky thanked Orbán for supporting Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and for giving asylum to Ukrainians.

On 27 February 2023, Viktor Orbán said that Hungary supports the Chinese peace plan in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, despite opposition by Western leaders. Beijing&#x27;s 12-point statement that criticised unilateral sanctions, would reduce strategic risks associated with nuclear weapons in Central and Eastern Europe, according to the statement.

==== Accession to the Organization of Turkic States ====
Since 2014, Hungary has had observer status at the General Assembly of Turkic-speaking States, and in 2017 it submitted an application for accession to the International Turkic Academy. During the 6th Summit of Turkic Council, Orbán said that Hungary is seeking even closer cooperation with the Turkic Council. In 2018, Hungary obtained observer status in the council. In 2021, Orbán mentioned that the Hungarian and Turkic peoples share a historical and cultural heritage &quot;reaching back many long centuries&quot;. He also pointed out that the Hungarian people are &quot;proud of this heritage&quot;, and &quot;were also proud when their opponents in Europe mocked them as barbarian Huns and Attila&#x27;s people&quot;. In 2023, during his visit to Kazakhstan, Orbán said that Hungarians come to Kazakhstan &quot;with great pleasure&quot; because the two nations are connected by &quot;millennial common roots&quot;.

==== Israel and Hamas ====
The Hungarian government expressed support for Israel in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. On 13 October, Orbán stated &quot;Israel has the right to defend itself&quot; and &quot;we will not allow sympathy rallies supporting terrorist organisations&quot;. On 22 October, Fidesz parliamentary leader Máté Kocsis announced that the party will introduce a manifesto before the parliament condemning Hamas terrorism.

==Policy and views==

Orbán&#x27;s blend of soft Euroscepticism, populism, and national conservatism has seen him compared to politicians and political parties as diverse as Jarosław Kaczyński&#x27;s Law and Justice, Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia, Matteo Salvini&#x27;s Lega (previously Lega Nord), Marine Le Pen&#x27;s National Rally, Donald Trump, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Vladimir Putin. Orbán has sought to make Hungary an &quot;ideological center for ... an international conservative movement&quot;.

According to &quot;Politico&quot;, Orbán&#x27;s political philosophy &quot;echoes the resentments of what were once the peasant and working classes&quot; by promoting an &quot;uncompromising defense of national sovereignty and a transparent distrust of Europe&#x27;s ruling establishments&quot;. Orbán frequently emphasizes the importance of Christianity, although he and the overwhelming majority of Hungarians do not attend church regularly. His authoritarian appeal to &quot;global conservatives&quot; has been summarized by Lauren Stokes as: &quot;I alone can save you from the ravages of Islamization and totalitarian progressivism – and in the face of all that, who has time for checks and balances and rules?&quot;. Orbán has criticized the EU, comparing it to forces that have occupied Hungary throughout history.

Orbán had a close relationship with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, having known him for decades. He is described as &quot;one of Mr Netanyahu&#x27;s closest allies in Europe&quot;. Orbán received personal advice on economic reforms from Netanyahu, while the latter was Finance Minister of Israel (2003–2005). In February 2019, Netanyahu thanked Orbán for &quot;deciding to extend the embassy of Hungary in Israel to Jerusalem&quot;.

Orbán is seen as having laid out his political views most concretely in a widely cited 2014 public address at Băile Tușnad (known in Hungary as the &quot;Tusnádfürdői beszéd,&quot; or &quot;Tusnádfürdő speech&quot;). In the address, Orbán repudiated the classical liberal theory of the state as a free association of atomistic individuals, arguing for the use of the state as the means of organizing, invigorating, or even constructing the national community. Although this kind of state respects traditionally liberal concepts like civic rights, it is properly called &quot;illiberal&quot; because it views the community, and not the individual, as the basic political unit. In practice, Orbán claimed, such a state should promote national self-sufficiency, national sovereignty, familialism, full employment and the preservation of cultural heritage.
Orbán&#x27;s second and third premierships have been the subject of significant international controversy, and reception of his political views is mixed. The 2011 constitutional changes enacted under his leadership were, in particular, accused of centralizing legislative and executive power, curbing civil liberties, restricting freedom of speech, and weakening the Constitutional Court and judiciary. For these reasons, critics have described him as an &quot;irredentist&quot;, a &quot;right-wing populist&quot;, an &quot;authoritarian&quot;, &quot;far-right&quot;, a &quot;fascist&quot;, &quot;autocratic&quot;, a &quot;Putinist&quot;, a &quot;strongman&quot;, and a &quot;dictator&quot;.
The European migrant crisis, coupled with continued Islamist terrorism in the European Union, have popularized Orbán&#x27;s nationalist, protectionist policies among European conservative leaders. &quot;Once ostracized&quot; by Europe&#x27;s political elite, writes &quot;Politico&quot;, Orbán &quot;is now the talisman of Europe&#x27;s mainstream right&quot;.

As mentioned above, Orbán has promoted the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. In a 2018 speech, he stated: &quot;I think there are many people who would like to see the end of Christian Europe, and they believe that if they replace its cultural subsoil, if they bring in millions of people from new ethnic groups which are not rooted in Christian culture, then they will transform Europe according to their conception.&quot;
During a press conference in January 2019, Orbán praised Brazil&#x27;s then president Jair Bolsonaro, saying that currently &quot;the most apt definition of modern Christian democracy can be found in Brazil, not in Europe&quot;.

In support of Orbán and his ideas, a think tank called the Danube Institute was established in 2013, funded by the Batthyány Foundation, which in turn is &quot;funded entirely by the Hungarian government&quot;. Batthyány &quot;sponsors international conferences and three periodicals, all in English: &quot;European Conservative&quot;, &quot;Hungarian Review&quot;, and &quot;Hungarian Conservative&quot;&quot;. In 2020, the institute began hosting fellows.

;In the United States
Orbán often attacked the administrations of presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, particularly for their supposed pro-immigration policies. Some analysts argue that Orban&#x27;s attacks on the US are largely political theater for his domestic voters.

In January 2022, Donald Trump endorsed Orbán in the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election, saying in a statement that he &quot;truly loves his Country and wants safety for his people&quot;, and praising his hard-line immigration policies. Donald Trump&#x27;s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, once called Orbán &quot;Trump before Trump&quot;.

In August 2021, Tucker Carlson hosted some episodes of his show, &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot;, from Budapest, praising Orbán as the one elected leader &quot;on the face of the earth, ... who publicly identifies as a Western-style conservative&quot;. He also conducted a fifteen-minute interview with Orbán, which was widely criticized for its fawning nature and lack of challenging questions.

In May 2022 the Conservative Political Action Conference, the &quot;flagship conference&quot; of American conservatism, held a satellite event in Budapest. In Florida, a law regulating sex education in schools, sometimes called the &quot;Don’t Say Gay&quot; law, resembles a similar Hungarian law passed in 2021 and was, according to governor Ron DeSantis&#x27;s press secretary, inspired by it.

In August 2022, Orbán was the opening speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Dallas, Texas.

=== Domestic policy ===
Viktor Orbán&#x27;s domestic policy agenda has placed emphasis on cultural conservatism, especially through pro-natalist policies designed to encourage family formation and reduce immigration. Female university graduates who have (or adopt) children within two years of graduation receive partial or full forgiveness on their student loans, including a full write-off of their student debt if they have three or more children. Hungarian women who have four or more children are eligible for full income tax exemption for life. Married couples are eligible for low fixed-rate mortgages on a house with additional financial support through family housing benefits, as well as subsidies for the purchase of seven-seat cars for families with three or more children and financial support for child care. In support of these policies, Orbán stated in 2019 that &quot;For the west, the answer is immigration. For every missing child there should be one coming in and then the numbers will be fine. But we do not need numbers. We need Hungarian children.&quot; The government has also tightened legal regulations on access to abortion, including requiring pregnant women to listen to the heartbeat of the fetus prior to an abortion being approved by a doctor. The number of abortions procured in Hungary between 2010 and 2023 fell almost 45%, from 44.8 per hundred live births in 2010 to 24.8 per hundred in 2023.

As stated by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;Hungarian government doubled family spending between 2010 and 2019&quot;, intending to achieve &quot;a lasting turn in demographic processes by 2030&quot;. Orbán has espoused an anti-immigration platform, and has also advocated for increased investment into &quot;Family First&quot;. Orbán has disregarded the European Union&#x27;s attempts to promote integration as a key solution to population distribution problems in Europe. He has also supported investments into countering the country&#x27;s low birth rates. Orbán has tapped into the &quot;great replacement theory&quot; which emulates a nativist approach to rejecting foreign immigration out of fear of replacement by immigrants. He has stated that &quot;If Europe is not going to be populated by Europeans in the future and we take this as given, then we are speaking about an exchange of populations, to replace the population of Europeans with others.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;This year the Hungarian government introduced a 10 million forint (£27,000) interest-free loan for families, which does not have to be paid back if the couple has three children.&quot;

His government&#x27;s economic approach has been referred to as &quot;Orbánomics&quot;. Despite early concerns that these reforms would undermine investor confidence, economic growth has been strong with unemployment &quot;plummeting&quot; between 2010 and 2021 and year-on-year GDP growth at 4 percent in 2021. Progressive taxation on income was abolished in 2015 and replaced with a flat rate of 16% on gross income, and income taxes on those aged 25 years or younger was abolished entirely in 2021. Hungary paid the last of its IMF loan ahead of schedule in 2013, with the fund closing its Budapest office later that year. Due to the economic impact of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the shocks of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, Orbán&#x27;s government has imposed windfall taxes on banks, pharmaceutical companies, and energy companies in order to maintain a government-subsidized cap on utility bills (including gas, electricity, water, district heating, sewage, and garbage collection) which continues into 2023.

Orbán&#x27;s government has encouraged and provided financial support for the establishment of conservative think-tanks and cultural institutions. The Mathias Corvinus Collegium has purchased stakes in several European universities and has purchased the Modul University in Vienna. The think tank&#x27;s Brussels branch opened in November 2022. In 2021, Orbán&#x27;s government passed a bill which privatized 11 Hungarian universities and subsequently were endowed billions of euros in assets from the state budget, as well as real estate and shares in large companies. The government has appointed conservatives to the supervisory boards of these universities.

As part of a drive to &quot;re-Christianize&quot; the country, his government has privatised many previously state-run schools and enlisted Christian churches to provide education, introduced religion classes into the national education curriculum, and provided financial support to more Christian schools. The country&#x27;s kindergarten curriculum was amended to promote &quot;national identity, Christian cultural values, patriotism, attachment to homeland and family&quot;. Between 2010 and 2018, the number of Catholic schools increased from 9.4 percent to 18 percent. The government also created the Center for Fundamental Rights (Hungarian: ) in 2013 who describe their mission as &quot;preserving national identity, sovereignty and Christian social traditions&quot;. In 2019 the government passed a law taking control of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

===Democratic backsliding, corruption and authoritarianism===
According to Transparency International, Hungary was the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2023. Between 2010 and 2020, Hungary dropped 69 places in the Press Freedom Index, lost 11 places in the Democracy Index, and deteriorated 16 places in the Corruption Perceptions Index. In 2019 Freedom House downgraded the country from &quot;free&quot; to &quot;partly free&quot;. The V-Dem Democracy indices rank Hungary in 2021 as 96th in its &quot;electoral democracy index&quot; that measures &quot;whether elections were free and fair, as well as the prevalence of a free and independent media&quot;, sitting between Benin and Malaysia. Additionally, Freedom House&#x27;s &quot;Nations in Transit 2020&quot; report reclassified Hungary from a democracy to a transitional or hybrid regime. Furthermore, in 2022, the European Parliament stated that &quot;Hungary can no longer be considered a full democracy&quot; and that the country has become an &quot;electoral autocracy&quot;.

The late professor of economics at Harvard University, János Kornai, described the evolution of the Hungarian state during Orbán&#x27;s second premiership as having taken a &quot;u-turn&quot; away from the aim of becoming a market economy based on the rule of law and private ownership and instead beginning the &quot;systematic destruction of the fundamental institutions of democracy&quot;. In her 2015 article on Orbán&#x27;s illiberal democracy, Abby Innes, associate professor of political economy at the London School of Economics simply states that &quot;Hungary can no longer be ranked a democratic country&quot;. Former minister of education, Bálint Magyar, has stated that elections in Hungary under Orbán are undemocratic and &quot;free but not fair&quot;, due to gerrymandering, large-scale control over the media, and suspect funding for political campaigns.

In the April 2022 election, Orbán&#x27;s Fidesz party won 54% of the vote but 83% of the districts, due to gerrymandering, and &quot;other tweaks&quot; to Hungarian electoral rules. According to American journalist and author Andrew Marantz, Orbán passed laws, amended the constitution and &quot;patiently debilitated, delegitimatized, hollowed out&quot; civic institutions such as courts, universities, and the apparatus necessary for free elections that are now controlled by Orbán loyalists. Domination of the public media by Orbán prevents the public from hearing critics&#x27; point of view. In 2022, Orbán&#x27;s opponent was given just five minutes on the national television &quot;to make his case to the voters&quot;. Private media outlets like the ATV and RTL, among others, offered playtime for opposition members. An example of the discreet, below-the-radar process of accumulating power by Orbán and his party was the creation of a special police force that started as a small anti-terror unit. The unit grew and became more powerful &quot;bit by bit in disparate clauses buried in unrelated laws&quot;. Marantz cites Princeton professor of sociology Kim Lane Scheppele, who contends the unit now has enough power to function &quot;essentially&quot; as Orbán&#x27;s &quot;secret police&quot;.

Hungarian political scientist , using Max Weber&#x27;s classification, argues that Orbán&#x27;s rule cannot be described simply by the notions of authoritarianisation or illiberalism. He stresses out that the Orbán regime can be characterised as plebiscitary leadership democracy instead. In addition, extensive research has been conducted to describe the idea of a &quot;national, sovereign, bourgeois Hungary&quot; stated as the goal of Orbán&#x27;s rule, is in fact a &quot;political product&quot; of a post-communist mafia state serving to obscure massive corruption and transfers of wealth to those with the right connections.

=== Anti-LGBT policies ===
Since his election as prime minister in 2010, Orbán has led initiatives and laws to hinder human rights of LGBT+ people, regarding such rights as &quot;not compatible with Christian values&quot;.
In 2020, Orbán&#x27;s government ended legal recognition of transgender people, receiving criticism both in Hungary and abroad.

In 2021, his party proposed new legislation to censor any &quot;LGBT+ positive content&quot; in movies, books or public advertisements and to severely restrict sex education in school forbidding any information thought to &quot;encourage gender change or homosexuality&quot;. The law has been likened to Russia&#x27;s restriction on &quot;homosexual propaganda&quot;. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen harshly criticized the law, while a letter from sixteen EU leaders including Pedro Sánchez and Mario Draghi warned against &quot;threats against fundamental rights and in particular the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation&quot;.

His anti-LGBT+ positions came under more scrutiny after the revelation that one of the European deputies of his party, József Szájer, had participated in a gay sex party in Brussels, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic quarantine restrictions. Szájer was one of the major architects behind the 2011 Constitution of Hungary. This new constitution has been criticized by Human Rights Watch for being discriminatory towards the LGBT+ community.

To coincide with the parliamentary election in the spring of 2022, Orbán announced a four-question referendum regarding LGBTQ issues in education. It did not pass. It came after complaints from the European Union (EU) about anti-LGBTQ discriminatory laws. Human rights groups condemned the referendum as anti-LGBT rhetoric that supported discrimination.

On July 22, 2023, in a speech he gave in Romania, Orbán complained that the EU was conducting an &quot;LGBTQ offensive&quot;.

===Criticism and political techniques===
Orbán&#x27;s critics have included domestic and foreign leaders (including former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the Presidents of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso, and Jean-Claude Juncker), intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations. He has been accused of pursuing anti-democratic reforms; attacking the human rights of the LGBT community; reducing the independence of Hungary&#x27;s press, judiciary and central bank; amending Hungary&#x27;s constitution to prevent amendments to Fidesz-backed legislation; and of cronyism and nepotism.

Orbán was accused of pork barrel politics for building Pancho Aréna, a 4,000-seat stadium in the village in which he grew up, Felcsút, at a distance of some from his country house.

==== Economic cronyism ====
In the book &quot;The Ark of Orbán,&quot; Attila Antal wrote that the Orbán system of governance is characterized by the transformation of public money into private money, a system that has built a neo-feudal world of national capitalists, centered on the prime minister and his own family business interests. The largest share of national capitalists is the oligarchy &quot;produced&quot; by the system, such as István Tiborcz, who is closest to Viktor Orbán, and Lőrinc Mészáros and his family.

A 2016 opinion piece for &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Kenneth Krushel called Orbán&#x27;s political system a kleptocracy that wipes some of the country&#x27;s wealth partly into its own pockets and partly into the pockets of people close to it.

A 2017 &quot;Financial Times&quot; article compared the Hungarian elite under Orbán&#x27;s government to Russian oligarchs. The article noted that they differ in that Hungary&#x27;s &quot;Oligarchs&quot; under Orbán largely benefit from EU subsidies, unlike the Russian oligarchs. The article also mentioned the sudden increase in the personal wealth of Orbán&#x27;s childhood friend, Lőrinc Mészáros, thanks to winning state contracts.

A 2019 &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation revealed how Orbán leased plots of farm land to politically connected individuals and supporters of his and his party, thereby channeling disproportionate amounts of the EU&#x27;s agricultural subsidies Hungary receives every year into the pockets of cronies.

==== Opposition to European integration ====
Some opposition parties and critics also consider Orbán an opponent of European integration. In 2000, opposition parties MSZP and SZDSZ and the left-wing press presented Orbán&#x27;s comment that &quot;there&#x27;s life outside the EU&quot; as proof of his anti-Europeanism and sympathies with the radical right. In the same press conference, Orbán clarified that &quot;It will not be a tragedy if we cannot join the EU in 2003. (...) But this is not what we are preparing for. We are trying to urge our integration [into the EU], because it may give a new push to the economy.&quot;

==== Migrant crisis ====
Hungarian-American business magnate and political activist George Soros criticized Orbán&#x27;s handling of the European migrant crisis in 2015, saying: &quot;His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.&quot;

Orbán has been criticized for engineering the 2015 European migrant crisis for his own political gain. Specifically, he has been accused of mistreating migrants within Hungary and later sending many to Western Europe in an effort to stoke far-right sympathies in Western European countries. During the crisis, Orbán ordered fences be put up across the Hungarian borders with Serbia and Croatia and refused to comply with the European Union&#x27;s mandatory asylum quota.

In 2015, &quot;The New York Times&quot; acknowledged that Orbán&#x27;s stance on migration is slowly becoming mainstream in European politics. Andrew Higgins interviewed Orbán&#x27;s ardent critic, György Konrád, who said that Orbán was right and Merkel was wrong concerning the handling of the migrant crisis.

;Anti-Soros theme
The Orbán government began to attack George Soros and his NGOs in early 2017, particularly for his support for more open immigration. In July 2017, the Israeli ambassador in Hungary joined Jewish groups and others in denouncing a billboard campaign backed by the government. Orbán&#x27;s critics claimed it &quot;evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the Second World War&quot;. The ambassador stated that the campaign &quot;evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear&quot;, an apparent reference to the Holocaust. Hours later, Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a &quot;clarification&quot;, denouncing Soros, stating that he &quot;continuously undermines Israel&#x27;s democratically elected governments&quot; and funded organizations &quot;that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself&quot;. The clarification came a few days before an official visit to Hungary by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The anti-Soros messages became key elements of the government&#x27;s communication and campaign since then, which, among others, also targeted the Central European University (CEU).

Journalist Andrew Marantz argues that whether or not Soros was doing any actual harm to Hungary or conservative values, it was important to have a face to attack in a political campaign rather than abstract ideas like &quot;globalism, multiculturalism, bureaucracy in Brussels&quot;; and that this was a strategy explained to Orbán by political consultant Arthur J. Finkelstein.

==== Accusations of antisemitism ====
Orbán has been frequently accused of antisemitism, particularly for promoting conspiracy theories about the Jewish philanthropist George Soros. In 2022 he was condemned by the International Auschwitz Committee for comments in which he criticised mixing &quot;with non-Europeans&quot;. The Committee called on the EU to continue to distance itself from &quot;Orbán&#x27;s racist undertones and to make it clear to the world that a Mr. Orbán has no future in Europe&quot;. Others have rejected the claim that he is antisemitic, arguing that his founding of the Holocaust Memorial Center and Memorial Day for the Hungarian Victims of the Holocaust are evidence of this. He has also been accused of rehabilitating antisemitic Hungarian historical figures and of exploiting antisemitism.

==== Irredentism and nativism ====
Orbán&#x27;s policy positions have been reported to lean towards irredentism and nativism. He has overseen the transfer of hundreds of millions of Hungarian taxpayer money for the preservation of Hungarian language and monuments and institutions of the Hungarian diaspora, particularly in Romania, irking the Romanian government.

==== Mixed-race statement ====
In a speech delivered to the 31st Bálványos Free Summer University and Student Camp in July 2022, Orbán expressed views that were later described as &quot;a pure Nazi text&quot; that was &quot;worthy of Goebbels&quot; by one of his senior advisers, Zsuzsa Hegedűs, in her letter of resignation. In the speech, Orbán stated that &quot;Migration has split Europe in two – or I could say that it has split the West in two. One half is a world where European and non-European peoples live together. These countries are no longer nations: they are nothing more than a conglomeration of peoples&quot; and &quot;we are willing to mix with one another, but we do not want to become peoples of mixed-race&quot;. The speech drew condemnation from both the Romanian foreign ministry and other European leaders. Two days later, in Vienna, Orbán made it clear, he was talking about cultures and not about race. Zsuzsa Hegedüs later, in a letter to Orbán expressed that she is proud of him, and he can count on her like he could in the past 20 years.

Later that month, he touched on this criticism in a speech at the CPAC opening in Dallas, saying that &quot;a Christian politician cannot be racist&quot; and calling his critics &quot;simply idiots&quot;. He also attacked billionaire George Soros, former United States President Barack Obama, &quot;globalists&quot;, and the United States&#x27; Democratic Party.

==Personal life==

Orbán married jurist Anikó Lévai in 1986, they have five children. Their eldest daughter, Ráhel, is married to entrepreneur , whose company, Elios, was accused of receiving unfair advantages when winning public tenders. (see ) Orbán&#x27;s son, Gáspár, is a retired footballer, who played for Ferenc Puskás Football Academy in 2014. Gáspár is also one of the founders of a religious community called Felház. 

Orbán is a member of the Calvinist-oriented Hungarian Reformed Church, while his wife and their five children were raised Catholic. His son Gáspár Orbán converted in 2014 to the Faith Church, a Pentecostal denomination, and is currently a minister. He has claimed to have heard from God and to have witnessed miraculous healings.

Hatvanpuszta, a historic estate once part of Archduke Joseph’s Alcsút estate, was purchased in 2011 by a company owned by Viktor Orbán’s father, Orbán Győző. The estate has since undergone extensive redevelopment, sparking controversy and allegations of secrecy, with critics suggesting it serves as a private retreat for the Hungarian Prime Minister.

===Football interests===
Orbán has played football from his early childhood. He was a professional player with FC Felcsút. After ending his football career, he became one of the main financiers of the Hungarian football and his hometown&#x27;s club, Felcsút FC, later renamed the Ferenc Puskás Football Academy. He had a prominent role in the foundation of Puskás Akadémia in Felcsút.

He played an important role in establishing the annually organised international youth cup, the Puskás Cup, at Pancho Aréna, which he also helped build, in his hometown of Felcsút. His only son, Gáspár, learned and trained there.

Orbán is said to watch as many as six games a day. His first trip abroad as prime minister in 1998 was to the World Cup final in Paris; according to inside sources, he has not missed a World Cup or Champions League final since.

Then FIFA President Sepp Blatter visited the facilities at the Puskás Academy in 2009. Blatter, together with the widow of Ferenc Puskás, as well as Orbán, founder of the academy, announced the creation of the new FIFA Puskás Award during that visit. He played the minor role of a footballer in the Hungarian family film &quot;Szegény Dzsoni és Árnika&quot; (1983).

<doc id="750583" wikidata="Q1987213" url="?curid=750583" title="Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)">
<text>The Battle of Dyrrhachium took place on October 18, 1081 between the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118), and the Normans of southern Italy under Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria. The battle was fought outside the city of Dyrrhachium (present-day Durrës in Albania), the major Byzantine stronghold in the western Balkans, and ended in a Norman victory.

Following the Norman conquest of Byzantine Italy and Saracen Sicily, the Byzantine emperor, Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–1078), betrothed his son to Robert Guiscard&#x27;s daughter. When Michael was deposed, Robert took this as an excuse to invade the Byzantine Empire in 1081. His army laid siege to Dyrrhachium, but his fleet was defeated by the Venetians. On October 18, the Normans engaged a Byzantine army under Alexios I Komnenos outside Dyrrhachium. The battle began with the Byzantine right wing routing the Norman left wing, which broke and fled. Varangian troops joined in the pursuit of the fleeing Normans, but became separated from the main force and were massacred. Norman knights attacked the Byzantine centre and routed it, causing the bulk of the Byzantine army to rout.

After this victory, the Normans took Dyrrhachium in February 1082 and advanced inland, capturing most of Macedonia and Thessaly. Robert was then forced to leave Greece to deal with an attack on his ally, the Pope, by the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV (r. 1084–1105). Robert left his son Bohemond in charge of the army in Greece. Bohemond was initially successful, defeating Alexios in several battles, but was defeated by Alexios outside Larissa in 1083. Forced to retreat to Italy, Bohemond lost all the territory gained by the Normans in the campaign. The Byzantine recovery began the Komnenian restoration.

==Background==

The Normans first arrived in Southern Italy in 1015 from northern France and served local Lombard lords as mercenaries against the Byzantine Empire. As they were paid with lands, soon they were powerful enough to challenge Papal authority; in 1054, they defeated the Papal States at the Battle of Civitate, forcing the Holy See to acknowledge their authority. In 1059, Pope Nicholas II made Robert Guiscard, of the Hauteville family, Duke of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. However, most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands, and Sicily was in Saracen hands.

By 1071, Robert, together with his brother Roger, had taken over the last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1074, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert&#x27;s daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a pretext to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.

Robert conscripted all men of a fighting age into the army, which he refitted. Meanwhile, he sent an ambassador to the Byzantine court with orders to demand proper treatment for Helena and to win over the Domestic of the Schools, Alexios. The results of these attempts remain unknown, but the ambassador was favorably impressed by Alexios and as he was returning to Italy, he heard of the latters&#x27;s successful coup against Botaneiates, by which he became Alexios I Komnenos.

When the ambassador returned, he urged Robert to make peace, claiming that Alexios wanted nothing but friendship with the Normans. However, Robert had already committed himself to war; he sent his son Bohemond with an advance force towards Greece and Bohemond landed at Aulon, with Robert following shortly after.

==Prelude==
The Norman fleet of 150 ships including 60 horse transports set off towards the Byzantine Empire at the end of May 1081. The army numbered 15,000 men, including about 1,300 Norman knights. The fleet sailed to Avalona in Byzantine territory; they were joined by several ships from Ragusa, a republic in the Balkans who were enemies of the Byzantines.

Robert soon left Avalona and sailed to the island of Corfu, which surrendered because of a small garrison. Having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements from Italy, he advanced on the city of Dyrrhachium, the capital and chief port of Illyria. The city was well defended on a long, narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast, but separated by marshlands. Guiscard brought his army onto the peninsula and pitched camp outside the city walls. However, as Robert&#x27;s fleet sailed to Dyrrhachium, it was hit by a storm and lost several ships.

Meanwhile, when Alexios heard that the Normans were preparing to invade Byzantine territory, he sent an ambassador to the Doge of Venice, Domenico Selvo, requesting aid and offering trading rights in return. The Doge, alarmed by Norman control of the Strait of Otranto, took command of the Venetian fleet and sailed at once, surprising the Norman fleet under the command of Bohemond as night was falling. The Normans counter-attacked tenaciously, but their inexperience in naval combat betrayed them. The experienced Venetian navy attacked in a close formation known as &quot;sea harbour&quot; and together with their use of Greek fire &quot;bombs&quot;, the Norman line scattered, and the Venetian fleet sailed into Dyrrhachium&#x27;s harbour.

==Siege of Dyrrhachium==
Robert was not discouraged by this naval defeat, and began his siege of Dyrrhachium. In command of the garrison at Dyrrhachium was the experienced general George Palaiologos, sent by Alexios with orders to hold out at all costs while Alexios himself mustered an army to relieve the city.

Meanwhile, a Byzantine fleet arrived and – after joining with the Venetian fleet – attacked the Norman fleet, which was again defeated. The Byzantine garrison at Dyrrhachium managed to hold out all summer, despite Robert&#x27;s catapults, ballistae and siege tower. The garrison made continuous sallies from the city; on one occasion, Palaiologos fought all day with an arrowhead in his skull. Another sally succeeded in destroying Robert&#x27;s siege tower.

Robert&#x27;s camp was struck by disease; according to contemporary historian Anna Comnena up to 10,000 men died, including 500 knights. Even so, the situation of the Dyrrhachium garrison grew desperate because of the effects of Norman siege weapons. Alexios learned of this while he was in Salonica with his army so he advanced in full force against the Normans. According to Comnena, Alexios had about 20,000 men; historian John Haldon puts the army&#x27;s size between 18,000 and 20,000 men, while John Birkenmeier estimates it between 20–25,000 men. It consisted of Thracian and Macedonian tagmata, which numbered about 5,000 men; the elite excubitors and vestiaritai units, which numbered around 1,000 men; a force of Manichaeans which comprised 2,800 men, Thessalian cavalry, Balkan conscripts, Armenian infantry and other light troops. Aside from the Byzantine regulars, Alexios was bolstered by 2,000 Turkish and 1,000 Frankish mercenaries, about 1,000 Varangians and 7,000 Turkish auxiliaries sent by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm. Alexios also withdrew the tagmas from Heraclea Pontica and the remaining Byzantine holdings in Asia Minor and by doing so, he effectively left them undefended.

==Battle==
===Initial moves===
Alexios advanced from Salonica and pitched camp on the river Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15. He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; among them was George Palaiologos, who had managed to sneak out of the city. A majority of the senior officers, including Palaiologos, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard&#x27;s army from the rear, while they were still besieging the city. Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.

Guiscard, however, had been informed of Alexios&#x27; arrival by his scouts and on the night of October 17, he moved his army from the peninsula to the mainland. Upon learning of Guiscard&#x27;s move, Alexios revised his battle plan. He split his army into three divisions, with the left wing under the command of Gregory Pakourianos, the right wing under the command of Nikephoros Melissenos, and himself in command of the centre. Guiscard formed his battle line opposite Alexios&#x27;s, with the right wing under the command of the Count of Giovinazzo, the left under Bohemond and Guiscard facing Alexios in the centre.

The Varangians had been ordered to march just in front of the main line with a strong division of archers a little behind them. The archers had been commanded to move in front of the Varangians and loose a volley before retreating behind them. The archers continued this tactic until the army neared contact.

As the opposing armies closed in, Guiscard sent a detachment of cavalry positioned in the centre to feint an attack on the Byzantine positions. Guiscard hoped the feint would draw up the Varangians; however, this plan failed when the cavalry was forced back by the archers. The Norman right wing suddenly charged forward to the point where the Byzantine left and centre met, directing its attack against the Varangian left flank. The Varangians stood their ground while the Byzantine left, including some of Alexios&#x27; elite troops, attacked the Normans. The Norman formation disintegrated and the routed Normans fled towards the beach. There, according to Comnena, they were rallied by Guiscard&#x27;s wife, Sikelgaita, described as &quot;like another Pallas, if not a second Athena&quot;.

===Byzantine collapse===
In the meantime, the Byzantine right and centre had been engaging in skirmishes with the Normans opposite them. However, with the collapse of the Norman right, the knights were in danger of being outflanked. At this point, the Varangians (mainly Anglo-Saxons who had left England after the Norman Conquest) joined in the pursuit of the Norman right. With their massive battle axes, the Varangians attacked the Norman knights, who were driven away after their horses panicked. The Varangians soon became separated from the main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault. Guiscard sent a strong force of spearmen and crossbowmen against the Varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them. A few Varangians, including the Varangian commander Nabites, escaped. The few remaining Varangians fled into the church of the Archangel Michael. The Normans immediately set the church on fire, and all Varangians perished in the blaze.

Meanwhile, George Palaiologos sortied out of Dyrrhachium, but failed to save the situation. Alexios&#x27;s ally, Serbian King Constantine Bodin stayed aside with his army, intending to await the outcome of the battle. When the Byzantines were defeated and started to flee, Bodin retreated with his army. The Turks who had been lent to him by the Seljuk Sultan Suleyman I followed Constantine&#x27;s example.

Deprived of his left wing (still in pursuit of the Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before breaking into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.

Alexios and his guards resisted as long as they could before retreating. As they retreated, Alexios was separated from his guard and was attacked by Norman soldiers. While escaping, he was wounded in his forehead and lost a lot of blood, but eventually made it back to Ohrid, where he regrouped his army.

==Aftermath==
The battle was a heavy defeat for Alexios. Historian Jonathan Harris states that the defeat was &quot;every bit as severe as that at Manzikert.&quot; He lost about 5,000 of his men, including most of the Varangians. Norman losses are unknown, but John Haldon claims they are substantial as both wings broke and fled. Historian Robert Holmes states: &quot;The new knightly tactic of charging with the lance &quot;couched&quot; – tucked firmly under the arm to unite the impact of man and horse – proved a battle-winner.&quot;

George Palaiologos had not been able to re-enter the city after the battle and left with the main force. The defense of the citadel was left to the Venetians, while the city itself was left to the Count of the Tent mobilizing from Arbanon (ἐξ Ἀρβάνων ὁρμωμένω Κομισκόρτη).

In February 1082, Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or Amalfian citizen opened the gates to the Normans. The Norman army proceeded to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance. While Guiscard was in Kastoria, messengers arrived from Italy, bearing news that Apulia, Calabria, and Campania were in revolt. He also learned that the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, was at the gates of Rome and besieging Pope Gregory VII, a Norman ally. Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360,000 gold pieces in return for an alliance. Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope. Guiscard rushed to Italy, leaving Bohemond in command of the army in Greece.

Alexios, desperate for money, ordered the confiscation of all the church&#x27;s treasure. With this money, Alexios mustered an army near Thessalonica and went to fight Bohemond. However, Bohemond defeated Alexios in two battles: one near Arta and the other near Ioannina. This left Bohemond in control of Macedonia and nearly all of Thessaly. Bohemond advanced with his army against the city of Larissa. Meanwhile, Alexios had mustered a new army and with 7,000 Seljuk Turks sent by the Sultan, he advanced on the Normans at Larissa and defeated them. The demoralised and unpaid Norman army returned to the coast and sailed back to Italy. Meanwhile, Alexios granted the Venetians a commercial colony in Constantinople, as well as exemption from trading duties in return for their renewed aid. They responded by recapturing Dyrrhachium and Corfu and returning them to the Byzantine Empire. These victories returned the Empire to its previous status quo and marked the beginning of the Komnenian restoration.

<text>The Championship (formerly known as Championship Goals between January 2008 and May 2008) is a British football television programme featuring highlights from the Coca-Cola Football League. It was almost always shown on Sunday mornings on ITV, presented by Matt Smith. Despite its name, it also covered Football League One and Football League Two matches, albeit to a lesser extent than Championship matches.

The show included various additional features since it began in August 2004 and had its format changed due to widespread criticism of the number of commercial breaks. Link scenes usually involved Smith speaking to camera from various parts of the stadium of the featured match, such as the dressing rooms, the referee&#x27;s office, the boot room, the pie stand and so on.

==The team==
===Presenter===
Matt Smith was the presenter from the start and very rarely absent. On the rare occasions he was absent, Andy Townsend, Robbie Earle, Craig Doyle and Dave Beckett deputised. Angus Scott previously had filled in before he left to work for Setanta Sports.

===Pundits===
The pundits (who often reported too) were Robbie Earle and Andy Townsend. They gave their analysis on some games but usually reported in depth on one particular game in the Football League. As of the 2007–08 season, pundits were very rarely used on the programme.

===Reporters===
The main reporters were Ned Boulting, Gabriel Clarke and Dave Beckett. There were also many occasional reporters such as Richard Henwood, Tom Skippings, Mike Hall, Andy Kerr, Mick Conway and Gary Bloom.

===Commentators===
Commentators on The Championship were Peter Drury, Jon Champion, Clive Tyldesley and John Rawling. Others included Phil Duffell, Tony Jones, Bob Symonds, Martyn Dean, Trevor Harris, Donovan Blake. Angus Scott was also a regular commentator before his move to Setanta.

== Format ==

Much of the show&#x27;s format was similar to ITV&#x27;s coverage of The Premiership, broadcast from 2001 to 2004. It primarily featured coverage of the weekend&#x27;s biggest Championship games, with a larger focus on the automatic promotion, playoff and relegation spots as the season progressed. Early into its run, analysis of bigger games was provided by Robbie Earle and Andy Townsend, however, as the show progressed, their appearances became more sporadic and punditry was all but scrapped from the show by 2007. Much like The Premiership, one or two &quot;featured&quot; matches would usually be the primary focus of an episode, shown in an 8-10 minute highlight format at the start of the programme (which reflected the format of its parent programme &quot;The Premiership&quot; and MOTD before the BBC lost their Premiership rights to ITV). Coverage of League One, League Two and smaller Championship games was less extensive, and usually limited only to goals, red cards, injuries, and other notable incidents. Post-game interviews with managers, chairmen, players and fans were also a regular fixture. Occasionally, the show would include reports and features on notable incidents throughout the Football League, such as Leicester City manager Gary Megson&#x27;s departure after just 41 days in 2007.

==End of the show==
The show came to an end in May 2009 when ITV&#x27;s Football League and League Cup highlights package expired. For the 2009–10 season, the BBC took over the domestic rights package, which also included live games, and broadcast a similarly formatted programme called &quot;The Football League Show&quot; on Saturday nights after the existing &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. Highlights of the games were also available online at the BBC Sport website.

<text>Anna Maria (Annie) Keary (3 March 18253 March 1879) was an English novelist, poet and an innovative children&#x27;s writer.

==Life==
Annie Keary was born at the rectory in Bilton, now Bilton-in-Ainsty, Yorkshire, the daughter of a former army chaplain, William Keary from County Galway in Ireland, and his wife, Lucy Plumer, of Bilton Hall. She was educated at home, as she suffered from poor health and slight deafness. In 1843, her father became incumbent of Sculcoates, near Hull, and simultaneously of Nunnington in North Yorkshire, where the family moved. Two years later, her father&#x27;s declining health called for another move to Clifton near Bristol. Their relationship was close and her father gave her much information about Ireland that she later incorporated into her novels.

Keary went in 1848 to keep house for a widowed brother with three children, in the semi-rural Trent Vale of north Staffordshire. Six happy years ended when her brother remarried. Soon after, she lost two other brothers and her own long engagement was broken off. Annie&#x27;s sister Eliza (see below) wrote a memoir after Annie&#x27;s death in Eastbourne in 1879. This was followed in 1883 by a volume of Annie&#x27;s letters. The memoir tells how Eliza accompanied the frail Annie to Egypt after her bereavements and disappointment in love, then to Cannes for research for her books, where the healthy climate agreed with her and she spent much time in later years.

The sisters helped to run a home for unemployed servant girls in Pimlico, London. They were befriended by the novelist Charles Kingsley and his family. More strongly religious after her trip to Egypt, the dominant side of Annie&#x27;s life became her family ties. She nursed her mother in her last illness in 1869 and later looked after four young cousins, whose parents were in India.

==Works==
Annie Keary&#x27;s first children&#x27;s book appeared in 1856, a year after her father died. Success as a novelist came with &quot;Sidney Grey: A Tale of School Life&quot; (1857), which drew local colour from the grimy brick kilns on the edge of Trent Vale. &quot;The Rival Kings&quot; (1858) broke new ground for a children&#x27;s book in featuring rival children&#x27;s gangs and their hatred for each other. Her third book, &quot;The Heroes of Asgard: Tales from Scandinavian Mythology&quot; (1857), was the first of four in collaboration with her sister Eliza. It retells the Norse myths for children. Keary continued to write children&#x27;s and educational books, for instance a well-regarded survey of &quot;Early Egyptian History&quot; (1861) and an accessible account of various Biblical nations, &quot;The Nations Around&quot; (1870).

Annie Keary branched out in 1859 into adult fiction with &quot;Through the Shadows&quot; (1859), but literary acclaim had to wait until her novel &quot;Castle Daly: The Story of an Irish Home Thirty Years Ago&quot; (1875), which was reprinted several times up to the end of the 1880s. It covers the Great Famine and the Young Irelanders&#x27; Uprising, and was serialized initially in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. A facsimile of the 1886 edition of it appeared in Volume 5 of &quot;Irish Women&#x27;s Writing, 1838–1888&quot;. It was said to delineate perceptively &quot;the strong and weak points of Saxon and Celtic character&quot;.

&quot;Oldbury&quot; (1869) is a novel set in the little town where she was raised. Keary&#x27;s final novel, &quot;A Doubting Heart&quot; (1879), was completed by a friend, Mrs K. Macquoid. Like her earlier work for adults, it shows signs of being stretched to fill the three volumes required by publishers in those days, although the characterizations and sense of place are strong.

Her original fairy-tales appeared in &quot;Little Wanderlin, and other fairy tales&quot; (1865), written with her sister Eliza. Another long fairy-tale entitled &quot;Through the Wood&quot; is told in the middle of a late sequel to her best-selling &quot;Sidney Grey&quot; novel: &quot;Sidney Grey: A Year from Home&quot; (1876). This differs strongly from the short &quot;Through the Wood&quot; story in &quot;Little Wanderlin&quot;. Her collaborator Eliza later wrote the fantasy novel &quot;The Magic Valley&quot; (1877), which also has fairy-tale elements It was issued in abridged form as part of a schools series, in about 1912, along with poetic adaptations of Annie Keary&#x27;s fairy tales.

She also wrote poetry and collaborated with her sister Eliza and their niece Maud on &quot;Enchanted Tulips and Other Verses for Children&quot;, but this seems not to have been published until 1914. A decade later came a small collection from Macmillan: &quot;Little Wanderlin, Little Silver Ear, The Magic Valley: And Poems of Childhood&quot; (1924).

==Eliza Harriett Keary (1827–1918)==
Apart from her collaborations with Annie Keary and her memoir of her, Eliza wrote poetry. Her &quot;Little Seal-Skin and Other Poems&quot; (1874) was poorly reviewed at the time, but has received attention since: Ellis calls her &quot;a strikingly promising and important female poetic voice that was tragically muted.&quot; She also wrote children&#x27;s fiction, including &quot;The Magic Valley, or, Patient Antoine&quot; (1877), &quot;At Home Again&quot; (1886), and &quot;Pets and Playmates&quot; (1887). She died in Torquay in 1918. Her nephew Charles Francis Keary (1848–1917), was also an acclaimed author of both realist and weird fiction, and a cataloguer for numismatic studies.

<text>The Fiat Cinquecento (Type 170) (, ) is a front engine front-wheel-drive, four passenger, three door hatchback city car manufactured and marketed by Fiat from 1991 to 1998 over a single generation.
It was manufactured at Fiat Auto Poland, which had manufactured its predecessor the Fiat 126.

Production of the Cinquecento ended in 1998 with the introduction of the Fiat Seicento.

==Design==
The origins of the Cinquecento trace to the early 1980s, with focused research projects of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Rome, studying a super-economical vehicle – from which a series of prototypes evolved, with abbreviations X1/72 to X1/79. In parallel, FSM, not yet under FIAT&#x27;s ownership, was studying the BOSMAL, a small car project that would culminate in the concept Beskid 106. Acquisition of FSM by the Italian automotive group led to the abandonment of this prototype in favor of a car that incorporated some of the concepts of the X1/7 series of previous years (until 1993 the cars produced in Poland were marketed as FSM rather than FIAT models). Notably, Patrick Le Quément, Renault&#x27;s chief designer, sought similar inspiration from the BOSMAL study, resulting in the first generation Renault Twingo.

Launched in December 1991 to replace the Fiat 126, the Cinquecento was designed by Ermanno Cressoni in collaboration with Antonio Piovano; the interior was designed by Claudio Mottino and Giuseppe Bertolusso.

The Cinquecento featured independent suspension front and in the rear, front disc brakes, side impact beams, crumple zone and galvanized body panels.

Steering was unassisted rack and pinion.

Options included central locking, power windows, sunroof, full-length retractable canvas roof, split rear seat, headlight range adjustment, and air conditioning.

The right hand drive version for the British market was launched in June 1993, as one of the few city cars marketed in the UK.

==Engines==
The Cinquecento was initially available with two engine choices, with the 1.1 L &quot;FIRE&quot; or &quot;sporting&quot; joining the lineup later. Although the 704 cc engine was mounted longitudinally, the bigger units were fitted transversely, making the little Fiat one of the few cars in the world available with both configurations at the same time.

===704 cc===
The smallest engine, intended for sale in Poland only, was a 704 cc OHV two cylinder unit, delivering or with catalyst. Cinquecento inherited this unit from the 126p BIS, an evolution of the 126p which was cancelled when the Cinquecento production started.

In order to be fitted in the front-wheel drive Cinquecento, it underwent a major refurbishment (although the engine still employed a carburettor), which resulted, among other changes, in the crankshaft revolving in the opposite direction than in the 126p BIS.

===903/899 cc===
The bigger engine was the 903 cc version of the veteran Fiat 100 OHV four cylinder engine, which saw service in many small Fiat models, starting with Fiat 850. (This engine dates back to the initial 633 cc unit as introduced in the 1955 FIAT 600.)

It was fitted with single point fuel injection and was the base engine in most markets. Due to fiscal limitations, the displacement of this unit was limited to 899 cc in 1993, with a slight reduction of output, now producing . This engine is derived from that used in the Fiat 127.

While it still retains OHV chain drive pushrod layout it now has hydraulic tappets. Also now uses twin coil distributorless ignition.

===1.1 &quot;FIRE&quot; (Sporting)===
In 1994, Fiat introduced the Cinquecento Sporting, featuring the 1108 cc SOHC &quot;FIRE&quot; engine from the entry level Punto of the same era, mated to a close ratio gearbox. Other additions were a drop in standard ride height, front anti roll bar, 13&quot; alloy wheels, plus colour coded bumpers and mirrors. The interior saw a tachometer added, along with sports seats, red seatbelts and a leather steering wheel and gear knob.

It is the Sporting model which gave birth to a rallying trophy and a Group A Kit-Car version.

===Elettra===
From 1992 to 1996, Fiat also produced and sold an electric variant of the Cinquecento called the Elettra. The car was offered with either a lead acid or NiCd battery pack, providing a ranges of and respectively. Unlike purpose built electric cars, the Cinquecento Elettra used two battery packs, one in the engine bay and one under the rear seats, replacing the fuel tank.

Although selling for 140,000 francs (~US$23,000), the Cinquecento Elettra enjoyed relative popularity in Italy, France and Switzerland.

==Abarth==
Fiat offered optional extras from the factory labelled with the Abarth name. The Abarth extras for the Cinquecento consisted of cosmetic changes only. A front apron with fitted fog lights, a rear apron, side skirts and a rear spoiler with a fitted 3rd brake light. There were also a set of 13&quot; Speedline five spoke alloys wheels available, instead of the standard Sporting alloys.

Unlike true Abarth models, there were no engine upgrades available from the factory and the car could not be purchased as a whole separate model. The Abarth parts were to be added by the purchaser at the time of ordering, hence it is common to see cars with only some of the Abarth extras.

==Concepts==
During the 1990s, a number of concept cars based on the Fiat Cinquecento were developed, by a number of design houses, including one that featured half of the car&#x27;s interior and a &quot;running board&quot; to place bikes.

Another of these designs was the 1992 &quot;Italdesign Cinquecento&quot; and subsequent 1993 &quot;Lucciola&quot;, a proposal for a new Cinquecento by Fabrizio Giugiaro of Italdesign. However, instead of the car becoming the next small Fiat city car, a version of the design ended up being put into production by the South Korean Daewoo Motor, as their Matiz in 1998. Instead, Fiat decided to update the Cinquecento&#x27;s styling in early 1998 and relaunch it as the Seicento, which continued until 2010 and enabled the Cinquecento&#x27;s basic design and most of its mechanicals to survive for nearly 20 years.

<doc id="750601" wikidata="Q2331865" url="?curid=750601" title="Coachella Valley">
<text>The Coachella Valley ( ) is an arid rift valley in the Colorado Desert of Southern California in Riverside County. The valley has been referred to as Greater Palm Springs and occasionally the Palm Springs Area due to the historic prominence of the city of Palm Springs. The valley extends approximately southeast from the San Gorgonio Pass to the northern shore of the Salton Sea and the neighboring Imperial Valley, and is approximately wide along most of its length. It is bounded on the northeast by the San Bernardino and Little San Bernardino Mountains, and on the southwest by the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains.

The Coachella Valley is notable as the location of several wintertime resort cities that have become popular destinations for full time retirees and seasonal residents known as snowbirds. The valley is also known for a number of annual events, including the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, and the Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival, all held in Indio. Other events include the Palm Springs Modernism Week, Palm Springs International Film Festival, the ANA Inspiration and Desert Classic golf tournaments, and the Indian Wells Open tennis tournament.

The Coachella Valley is home to the cities of Cathedral City, Coachella, Desert Hot Springs, Indian Wells, Indio, La Quinta, Palm Desert, Palm Springs, and Rancho Mirage.

Summers in the valley are extremely hot and valley winters are mild. As such, the valley&#x27;s population tends to fluctuate; from nearly 500,000 in April, to around 300,000 in July and August, to around 600,000 by January. It was stated by the Riverside County HR Department that &quot;Palm Springs and the Desert Communities&quot; were being visited by 3.5 million conventioneers and tourists annually.

The Coachella Valley connects with the Greater Los Angeles area to the west via the San Gorgonio Pass, a major transportation corridor, traversed by Interstate 10 and by the Union Pacific Railroad. The valley is considered part of the Low Desert and is included within the Desert Empire to differentiate it from the broader Inland Empire of Southern California.

==History==
The area had been surveyed by Edward Fitzgerald Beale in 1857, whose survey party used camels to cross the desert, primarily along the path of the historic Bradshaw Trail. It was not until the coming of the Southern Pacific Railroad and the discovery of abundant artesian wells later in the 19th century that the area began to expand.

The coming in 1926 of U.S. Route 99 northward through Coachella and Indio and westward toward Los Angeles, more or less along the present route of Interstate 10, helped further open agriculture, commerce and tourism to the rest of the country. So too did the coming of State Highway 111 in the early 1930s, which cut a diagonal swath through the valley and connected all of its major settlements. Dr. June McCarroll, then a nurse with the Southern Pacific whose office fronted U.S. 99 in Indio, is credited with being the first person to delineate a divided highway by painting a stripe down the middle of the roadbed in response to frequent head-on collisions. The standard was refined and adopted worldwide. Doctor McCarroll is memorialized by a stretch of I-10 through Indio named in her honor.

The Coachella Valley became popular among celebrities from Frank Sinatra to Dakota Fanning who came to enjoy vacations and winter homes in the desert resort community. It became a real estate destination in the 1980s and 1990s and has also become a tourist destination.

==Geography==
The Coachella Valley is the northernmost extent of the vast Salton Trough, also called the Cahuilla Basin, which includes the Salton Sea, and the Imperial Valley in the United States, as well as the Mexicali Valley and Colorado River Delta in Mexico. The trough is a result of combined tectonic activity of the San Andreas Fault, which follows the northeastern side of the valley, and the East Pacific Rise that runs up through the Gulf of California to the Salton Sea.
The area is surrounded on the southwest by the Santa Rosa Mountains, by the San Jacinto Mountains to the west, the Little San Bernardino Mountains to the east and San Gorgonio Mountain to the north. These mountains peak at around and tend to average between . Elevations on the valley floor range from above sea level at the north end of the Valley to below sea level around Mecca.

The San Andreas Fault traverses the valley&#x27;s east side. Because of this fault, the valley has many hot springs. The Santa Rosa Mountains to the west are part of the Elsinore Fault Zone. The results of a prehistoric sturzstrom can be seen in Martinez Canyon. The Painted Canyons of Mecca feature smaller faults as well as Precambrian, Tertiary and Quaternary rock formations, unconformities, badlands and desert landforms. Fault lines cause hot water springs or geysers to rise from the ground. These natural water sources made habitation and development possible in the otherwise inhospitable desert environment of the Coachella Valley. Major earthquakes have affected the Coachella Valley. For instance, the 1992 Landers earthquake caused some damage in the valley. An earthquake of local origin which caused considerable damage was the 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake, which registered at a magnitude of 6.0, injuring 29 people and destroying 51 homes.

===Climate===
In the summer months daytime temperatures range from to and nighttime lows from to . During winter, the daytime temperatures range from to and corresponding nights range from to making it a popular winter resort destination. The surrounding mountains create Thermal Belts in the immediate foothills of the Coachella Valley, leading to higher night-time temperatures in the winter months, and lower daytime temps during the summer months. Due to its warm year-round climate the region&#x27;s agricultural sector produces fruits such as mangoes, figs and dates.

The valley is the northwestern extension of the Sonoran Desert to the southeast, and as such, is extremely arid. Most precipitation falls during the winter months from passing mid-latitude frontal systems from the north and west, nearly all of it as rain, but with snow atop the surrounding mountains. Rain also falls during the summer months as surges of moisture from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California are drawn into the area by the desert monsoon. Occasionally, the remnants of a Pacific tropical cyclone can also affect the valley. In 1976, Tropical Storm Kathleen brought torrential rain and catastrophic flooding to the Coachella Valley as it swept in from the Pacific, traversing the region from south to north. A haboob powerful enough to have a significant impact on the Coachella Valley can happen every two years.


===Ecology===
This desert environment hosts a variety of flora and fauna, including the endangered California Fan Palm, &quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;, Bighorn sheep inhabit the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto mountain ranges as well as the fringe-toed lizard, an indigenous desert reptile whose numbers are increasing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Desert wildlife in the Coachella Valley includes localized subspecies of ants, bats, beetles, blackbirds, bobcats, coyotes, fleas, foxes, gnats, gophers, hawks, horseflies, jackrabbits, kangaroo rats, mosquitoes, mountain lions, pigeons, quails, rattlesnakes, ravens, roaches, roadrunners, scorpions, spiders, termites, ticks, wasps, whip scorpions or &quot;vinegaroons&quot;, and wildcats.

==Demographics==
As a retirement haven throughout the area&#x27;s history, a large percentage of residents are age 65 or older. The valley has some of the densest concentrations of senior citizens in California with three of California’s cities with the highest percentages of residents age 65 and older: Indian Wells, Rancho Mirage, and Palm Desert. Though the area is somewhat politically conservative, it is also home to a sizeable LGBT population; current estimates are that up to 33% of Palm Springs&#x27; residents identify as gay and lesbian, and Cathedral City is also home to a number of gay resorts, bars, restaurants and clubs. Many establishments along a stretch of Arenas Road in downtown Palm Springs are gay-oriented and serve as the center of the annual White Party. According to an interview with former Palm Springs mayor Ron Oden, perhaps at the time the United States&#x27; only openly gay African-American mayor, a large number of people living with HIV (PWH) have moved to the Palm Springs area to take advantage of the extensive health-support systems that have been developed in recent years (such as DAP Health). For this reason, the area has one of the highest per capita rates of HIV in the nation.

The area has a large percentage of Mexican American political figures, plus the state assembly representative Bonnie Garcia of La Quinta is of Puerto Rican parentage.

The Coachella Valley was settled by a diverse array of races and ethnicities. Once viewed as predominantly Caucasian, the Coachella Valley has features of a diverse history. As of 2004, the Claritas study found that 373,100 people resided in the region. The racial makeup was 44.7% Non-Hispanic White, 49.9% Hispanic, 1.8% Black/African American, 2.1% Asian/Pacific Islander, 0.4% American Indian and Inuit, 0.1% from other races, and 1.1% from two or more races.

===Early history===
In the early 20th century, less than 1,000 full-time residents lived in the &quot;village&quot; of Palm Springs, surrounding farms and ranches, and on the Indian reservation. The 1930 U.S. census found less than half the Coachella Valley&#x27;s population was &quot;white&quot;, the rest were Mexicans especially in the eastern ends when traqueros arrived to maintain the area&#x27;s railroads, and Native Americans of local tribes in what were then impoverished reservations.

Starting in the 1890s, there was a large Irish and Scottish presence in the region, after Palm Springs was an established agricultural colony called &quot;Palm Valley&quot; cofounded by Welwood Murray, a Scottish immigrant and John Guthrie McCallum, an American from the U.S. East Coast. The two men widely advertised the colony to settlers with an interest in a warm climate and the ideal winter residence.

===Hispanic community===
Hispanic Americans are long established in Palm Springs&#x27; central and eastern sections, and have constituted the majority of the populations of Indio and Coachella for many decades. In the 2000 U.S. census, about 35 percent of Coachella Valley residents were Latino. But according to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, an estimated half (50–60 percent) of the residents are Latino. A large portion of Latinos moving into the area are from the Los Angeles-Orange County and San Diego metro areas. 

Most of the valley&#x27;s Hispanics are Mexican from a multi-generational community (see Chicano), but Central American immigrants (especially in Indio and Cathedral City), Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, and South Americans are also numerous (esp. in Rancho Mirage and Palm Desert). Since the late 1980s, the large wave of immigration from neighboring Mexico has culturally impacted the Coachella Valley in many more ways than the rest of California or the country, but the national trend slowed down due to the late 2000s recession.

Most Hispanic immigrants came to obtain work in the area&#x27;s year-round agriculture, but today many find employment in construction and home remodeling, the resort hospitality industry, landscaping firms, and retail.

===Other racial/ethnic groups===
The prominence of Native Americans of the Cahuilla tribe is represented in local life; because of casino gambling and land ownership, the majority of local tribal members (Cahuilla pertaining to the Agua Caliente band and the Cabazon/Twentynine Palms bands) are in upper-income brackets. According to the Southern California National Congress of American Indians, less than 5 percent of the area&#x27;s residents are Native Americans.

African Americans are concentrated in Palm Springs&#x27; northern and eastern ends, as well as in small sections of Indio and Desert Hot Springs, but local African Americans live everywhere in middle-class and wealthy areas and comprise less than 5 percent of the local population. The area is home to 10,000 Indian Americans (mostly from Sri Lanka), descendants of agricultural workers in the 1930s and 1940s. Additionally, Palm Desert is the home of 1,000 Tahitians, a Pacific Islander people from French Polynesia.

Other ethnic groups in the area like Asian Americans (i.e. Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos), followed by a small wave of Armenians and Arabs (esp. Lebanese and Syrians) from the Middle East were involved in the area&#x27;s agriculture in the early 1900s. In recent years, the area (especially Palm Desert and Palm Springs) became popular for Iranian, Israeli, East Indian, Yugoslav (Former) and Korean home buyers, with most purchasing increasingly high-valued properties for investment purposes. 

===Local emphasis of tolerance===
In mid-2000, Palm Springs city officials and business leaders discussed making an unofficial declaration of Palm Springs as a &quot;hate-free zone&quot; as a sign of local pride to celebrate the city&#x27;s tolerance (Palm Springs, especially in &quot;The Advocate&quot; magazine that caters to gay and lesbian readership, has voted it as one of the top five most popular world places for the gay/lesbian community) and multicultural diversity of the city&#x27;s relaxed attitude regarding many races living close together. According to the Palm Springs Pride LGBT association poll and census data in 2010, an estimated 40–45 percent of Palm Springs&#x27; residents are thought to be LGBT and nearby Cathedral City is about one-quarter, each having above averages of LGBT people for a U.S. city.

===Religious life===

Many faiths and denominations are represented in the area. Protestants and Catholics are the most numerous. According to the Jewish Federation of the Desert based in Palm Springs, the Coachella Valley has one of California&#x27;s largest Jewish communities, estimated at 35,000, a result of being a major retirement destination and connections to the Hollywood film industry. There has also been a sizable Latter-Day Saints community since the early 1900s, with three stakes, formerly branches, which experienced rapid growth. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints form a large population in the Inland Empire and High Desert regions. The Islamic Society of the Coachella Valley has a mosque in the city of Coachella.

===Communities and population===
The Coachella Valley contains nine cities and several unincorporated communities.

The incorporated cities of the Coachella Valley had a population of approximately 370,000 at the 2020 Census. State projections estimate that the valley&#x27;s population will pass 1 million by 2066. Demographers believe the total population already surpassed the 500,000 mark, plus 100,000 temporary seasonal residents known as &quot;snowbirds&quot; arriving to stay during the winter months (from the end of October to the end of April).

The city of Palm Springs sits at the northwest end of the valley. Unincorporated areas and towns include Cabazon in the San Gorgonio Pass, and Bermuda Dunes and Thousand Palms in the east end of the valley. Others include Carver Tract, a county island between the cities of Indio and Coachella, Indio Hills, Sky Valley, North Palm Springs and Garnet along the northern rim along with Thermal, Vista Santa Rosa, Oasis and Mecca to the southeast. The native Cahuilla tribe represented in the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians, Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and the Torres-Martinez Band of Cahuilla Indians, the Mission Creek Band in unincorporated Painted Hills, and the Santa Rosa Indian Reservation south of Palm Desert, each have reservations in the area.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===

The irrigation of over of the Valley since the early 20th century has allowed widespread agriculture. In its 2006 annual report, the Coachella Valley Water District listed the year&#x27;s total crop value at over $576 million or almost $12,000 per acre. As of 2010 the valley produced agricultural products worth about $600 million.

The valley is the primary date-growing region in the United States, responsible for nearly 95 percent of the nation&#x27;s crop and is celebrated each year in Indio during the Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival. The earliest attempt at growing dates came about in 1890 when the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) imported date palm shoots from Iraq and Egypt. Sixty-eight shoots were distributed across the Southwest U.S. in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Yuma, Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, and several California cites: Indio, Pomona near Los Angeles, Tulare and National City near San Diego. The imports were almost all male seedlings and produced poor fruit. The Coachella Valley showed promise, so USDA horticulturist Bernard Johnson planted a number of shoots that he brought back from Algeria in September 1903. On his own initiative, Johnson imported more shoots from Algeria in 1908 and again in 1912. The area&#x27;s entire date industry can be traced back to those original USDA experiments near present-day Mecca. Date palms were grown from present-day Cathedral City to the Salton Sea, but most date groves were overtaken by development by the 1990s. Today nearly all of the date groves are in the &quot;East Valley&quot; area south of Indio, near Coachella and east of La Quinta.

Other agricultural products cultivated in the Coachella Valley include fruits and vegetables, especially table grapes, citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit; onions and leeks; and peppers. The valley floor served to grow bounties of alfalfa, artichokes, avocados, beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, corn, cotton, cucumbers, dandelions (salad greens), eggplant, figs, grains (i.e. barley, oats, rye and wheat; plus rice fields kept wet or moist in the Salton Sea area), hops, kohlrabi, lettuce, mangoes, nectarines and peaches, persimmons, plums and prunes, pomegranate, potatoes, radishes, spinach, strawberries, sugar cane, tomatoes, a variety of herbs and spices, and other vegetable crops. The Coachella grapefruit originated in the region. The city of Coachella is the primary shipping point for agricultural goods. Domesticated grasses, flowers and trees are widely grown for warm-weather or desert climates, and sold for use in golf courses and landscape.

Only 10 percent of the Coachella Valley residents were born/raised in the area, according to the 2000 census, a much lower percentage than found in most parts of the U.S. Agriculture is a founding block of the majority of the residents whose parents and grandparents came to the area as farmers and laborers transformed the eastern parts of the valley from a hot sandy desert into a fertile place with a year-round growing season. The Coachella Valley&#x27;s agricultural development is due to irrigation: water was drawn from an underground aquifer created when the valley was under a fresh water lake in the last ice age (over 10,000 years ago); and from the Coachella Canal, a concrete-lined aqueduct built between 1938 and 1948 as a branch of the All-American Canal, which brings water from the Colorado River to the Valley. The Colorado River Aqueduct, which provides drinking water to Los Angeles and San Diego, crosses the northeast end of the Valley along the base of the Little San Bernardino Mountains (the Joshua Tree National Park). Recent growth of fish farming or aquaculture in Mecca near the Salton Sea brings new promise to the local economy, especially to efforts to restore the ailing ecology of the large saltwater lake.

===Wind power===

The valley&#x27;s northwest entrance from the San Bernardino-Riverside along Interstate 10 is known as the San Gorgonio Pass and is the second windiest place in the country. Cool coastal air is forced through the pass and mixes with the hot desert air, making the San Gorgonio Pass one of only three ideal places in California for steady, wind-generated electricity. At the San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm, thousands of huge wind turbines spread across the desert and hills on either side of the highway greet visitors as they approach the crest of the pass and have become somewhat of a symbol of the area. The state&#x27;s other wind farms are in the Tehachapi Pass between Mojave and Bakersfield and in the Altamont Pass near Livermore.

==Recreation and annual activities==

With warm winters and more than 350 days of sunshine per year, recreational hiking and horseback riding are popular in the many canyons in the mountains that surround the valley. Thousand Palms Canyon is a popular destination, amongst many.

The Coachella Valley was once a safe haven for hay fever allergy sufferers before the surge of golf courses and year-round lawns, and people with bronchitis, emphysema and asthma chose to relocate for health reasons in the early half of the 20th century.

In the early 20th century, the town of Palm Springs was ideal for an agricultural economy. Today, many of the fields and groves of the desert cities were replaced by homes and golf courses. Agriculture thrived in the eastern or lower part of the Coachella Valley in Indio, Coachella, Thermal, Mecca, and Oasis thanks in part to a large underground aquifer to sustain a year-round green environment.

Roughly 125 golf courses blanket the area, making it one of the world&#x27;s premier golf destinations and the most popular golf vacation destination in California. The Merrill Lynch Skins Game was held in La Quinta each Thanksgiving and drew some of the biggest names in golf. The PGA has a major presence in La Quinta as well with the PGA WEST golf and residential complex. One of the host courses of the aforementioned Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, a PGA WEST fairway represents the area in Soarin&#x27; Over California, an IMAX-based attraction at Disney California Adventure Park theme park.

The area is also dotted with casinos owned by the local Indian tribes. As of 2024, there are six standalone casinos in the Coachella Valley. The valley is home to resort hotels built around spas with natural mineral water wells, specifically in Desert Hot Springs. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway takes visitors from the valley floor to the San Jacinto Peak mountain station above sea level.

Palm Springs is home to one of the country&#x27;s largest collections of mid-century architecture. Thousands of homes, apartments, hotels, businesses and other buildings were designed in this fashion across the city. International mid-century enthusiasts come to Palm Springs to admire the design.

==Media==
The Coachella Valley, under the title &quot;Palm Springs&quot;, is a distinct Nielsen and Arbitron ratings market, with eight local television stations and twenty radio stations. The first television station in the Coachella Valley is KMIR channel 6 by John Conte and Bob Hope, the NBC affiliate premiered in 1968 remains on the air as the desert&#x27;s longest running TV station. KPLM (which later became KESQ, the Coachella Valley&#x27;s current ABC affiliate) went on the air later with a party that made national headlines; it was founded by Robert E. Leonard. The station later made national news and garnered late night jokes from Johnny Carson and Bob Newhart when the station manager accidentally ran on air a pornographic movie. Gun TV, the gun shopping channel, was headquartered in the Valley.

Cable subscribers under Charter Spectrum cable can receive some Los Angeles area television channels as part of basic cable service. Satellite television and satellite radio are available as well. The eastern Coachella Valley can receive Mexican television from Mexicali, away.

The Gannett Company-owned &quot;The Desert Sun&quot; is the local daily newspaper; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and the &quot;Riverside Press-Enterprise&quot; is also sold there (Gannett also operates the Desert Post Weekly). The Desert Valley Star Weekly is an independent community weekly that covers the Coachella Valley, and the Desert Entertainer is a calendar-type entertainment weekly produced by Hi-Desert Publishing. The area&#x27;s city magazine, &quot;Palm Springs Life&quot; caters to the valley&#x27;s rich and famous elites, while The Sun Runner Magazine covers the California desert region, including the Coachella Valley. Palm Springs Art Patron Magazine covers the Art community of the Desert. A number of periodicals cover the area&#x27;s LGBT community, including &quot;In Magazine.&quot;

An alternative news and entertainment publication, the &quot;Coachella Valley Independent&quot;, was founded online in late 2012. It is currently in print as a monthly publication. Another independent publication is &quot;Coachella Valley Weekly&quot;, which is printed weekly and was also founded in 2012.

===Transportation===
Aviation in the area is served by the Palm Springs International Airport in Palm Springs, Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal and Bermuda Dunes Municipal Airport in Bermuda Dunes. Interstate 10 runs along the northeastern rim of the valley while State Route 111 runs for about 30 miles along the southwestern rim of the valley and serves as the main arterial highway between almost all Coachella Valley cities. A four-lane expressway now known as State Highway 86 opened in the early 1990s as a &quot;special&quot; bypass (hence, it was known as State Highway 86S until the &quot;S&quot; suffix was dropped) of the former two-lane portion of Highway 86. Historic signs designating the original route of U.S. Route 99 through the area may be found along present-day Indio Boulevard through Indio and Harrison Street through Coachella.

Public transportation in the valley is provided by the SunLine Transit Agency based in Thousand Palms, which was among the country&#x27;s first transit agencies to totally convert to alternate fuel vehicles, including full-sized buses powered by fuel cells.

The Palm Springs Airport provides service to many North American destinations. Amtrak trains serve North Palm Springs and its coaches provide a connection to Metrolink Los Angeles regional commuter rail at Moreno Valley station. Greyhound buses link the Valley with the Los Angeles metropolitan area, Calexico on the Mexican border, and points east.

==Notable people==

The area has been a magnet for Hollywood stars since the 1930s when Charles Farrell and Ralph Bellamy founded the Racquet Club of Palm Springs. Bing Crosby would later found the Blue Skies Trailer Park in Rancho Mirage, unique for its expensive trailer homes each with its own individual theme. In the mid-century celebrities known to stop by Palm Springs included Humphrey Bogart, John Barrymore, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Mary Pickford, Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, and Jack Benny, who did numerous broadcasts of his radio show from Palm Springs.

Farrell, after whom a street in Palm Springs is named, would later be elected mayor. Farrell Drive is built on the path of the Palmdale Railroad, a narrow-gauge horse-drawn railroad right-of-way originally built to serve the proposed town of Palmdale. The town was never built and the railroad was abandoned after a few years of operation. The ties were used to build one of the area&#x27;s earliest residences and the Cornelia White House still stands today in downtown Palm Springs.

Medal of Honor recipient Captain William McGonagle was a graduate of Coachella High School and made the valley his home after his retirement. Mitchell Paige was another Medal of Honor veteran who lived in Palm Desert and has a middle school in La Quinta named after him. Jacqueline Cochran, founder and director of the Women Airforce Service Pilots lived her last years in Indio. In 2005, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates reportedly bought and owns a home in The Vintage Club Country Club in Indian Wells.

Elvis Presley honeymooned in Palm Springs in 1967 and was a frequent visitor as well since he owned a home here from 1970 until his death in 1977. Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Dinah Shore were residents of the valley and were instrumental in the creation of three major golf tournaments, the Frank Sinatra Celebrity Golf Tournament, Bob Hope Chrysler Classic (now hosted by comedian and golf aficionado George Lopez) and the LPGA Tour&#x27;s Nabisco Championship. All three have streets named in their honor as does President Gerald Ford, a longtime Rancho Mirage resident and benefactor of the substance abuse center that bears his wife&#x27;s name, the Betty Ford Center on the campus of the Eisenhower Medical Center, named for general, U.S. president and part-time resident Dwight Eisenhower. The medical center expanded in size by the new Walter Annenberg building named for the valley resident, billionaire, friend of celebrities and philanthropist. Sinatra and his friends, including Dean Martin, Perry Como, Tony Bennett, Sammy Davis Jr., Rosemary Clooney and Connie Francis were frequent visitors in the close-knit celebrity community of the Coachella Valley in the 1950s and 1960s.

The main road into Palm Springs International Airport, named simply &quot;Airport Road&quot;, was renamed Kirk Douglas Way on October 17, 2004. Douglas, a major area benefactor, lived in the valley for more than fifty years and is credited with spearheading the drive to modernize the area over those five decades. His son, actor Michael Douglas, is said to own a residence in Palm Springs with his wife, actress Catherine Zeta-Jones.

Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were instrumental in forming the exclusive Thunderbird Heights tract in Rancho Mirage, once the home of President Gerald Ford and his wife Betty. According to &quot;Palm Springs Life&quot; magazine, that same tract inspired the name in late 1954 for the Ford Thunderbird. The magazine incorrectly cites that a favorite vacation spot for General Motors executives, Palm Desert&#x27;s Eldorado Country Club, inspired the name for Cadillac&#x27;s top model the year before — though Cadillac had chosen the name five years before the club&#x27;s founding in an internal competition. Local automotive history indicates that designer Raymond Loewy penned the Studebaker Avanti in his Palm Springs home. Especially since the 1950s, Palm Springs and nearby golf clubs are hailed as the &quot;playground of celebrities&quot;. However it is said that celebrities travel or reside in the Palm Springs area in lesser numbers as compared to yesteryear, but the area&#x27;s &quot;star power&quot; made a comeback in the 2000s.

Ball and Arnaz helped finance construction of the Indian Wells Country Club. Founded in 1956 with their winter residence on &quot;DesiLu Court&quot;, Indian Wells became a major factor in &quot;down valley&quot; growth in the 1970s and 1980s. A mostly gated community, Indian Wells has one of the highest &quot;per capita&quot; income of any small town in the United States, while nearby Coachella, a short distance southeast on State Route 111 is the third poorest city of the 10,000–50,000 population range in the nation, though that is rapidly changing as the area develops. A memorial to Eisenhower can be found on the front lawn of Indian Wells City Hall, also features the local veterans memorial plaque to represent the community&#x27;s 800 veterans, a high number of war veterans per ratio of its predominantly senior citizen population. Coachella has the Vietnam War veterans&#x27; memorial to represent their community&#x27;s high representation of armed forces volunteers, a large percentage had Spanish surnames since the city&#x27;s population are over 90 percent Latino.

Many other celebrities, past and present, have called the area home such as actor Paul Burke. Among those who grew up in the area:
* Vanessa Marcil is a La Quinta native and attended Indio High School.
* Suzanne Somers spent a part of her childhood in Cathedral City and attended Palm Springs High School.
* Billy Steinberg grew up in Palm Springs and worked at the Dave Freedman Grape Farm in Thermal.
* Alison Lohman is a native of Palm Springs and grew up in Palm Desert.
* Tyler Hilton is also a native of Palm Springs and graduated from La Quinta High School. Hilton performed a concert in the school theatre in 2006.
* Cameron Crowe grew up in a rural home near Indio.
* Rich Newey grew up in Bermuda Dunes.
* Alan O&#x27;Day grew up in Coachella.
* Aubrey O&#x27;Day was a 2001 graduate of La Quinta High School.
* Josh Homme attended Palm Desert High School.
* Tony Reagins, General Manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, is an Indio native and attended Indio High school.
* Edward White, football player of the San Diego Chargers and Minnesota Vikings is an Indio native and attended Indio High school.
* Jenna Ortega is a native of Indio.

U.S. President John F. Kennedy was a frequent guest of Frank Sinatra, and a plaque in one of the pews of Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Palm Desert marks the spot where Kennedy would usually sit during Mass.

That same area in Palm Desert once served as a training ground for General George Patton&#x27;s Third Army troops and tank battalions; today, the site is home to the El Paseo shopping district. Patton also trained in a huge plot of desert stretching from Chiriaco Summit just off the eastern end of the valley northward almost to Amboy along U.S. Route 66 in the Mojave Desert. Tank tracks from those maneuvers are still visible today in the open desert and a museum dedicated to Patton is located in Chiriaco Summit. Patton was also a frequent guest at the Whittier Ranch House in Indio, a grand adobe structure which had faced the possibility of demolition as the ranch lands surrounding it were being developed. A grass roots organization had petitioned the city to preserve the structure for use as a VFW post; it has instead been restored and retained as the clubhouse for the new Whittier Ranch housing development. It is also now a California state historic site.

Sonny Bono ran a restaurant in downtown Palm Springs. Frustrated by the lack of cooperation he faced from the city council over a new sign for the restaurant, the entertainer took matters into his own hands and ran for mayor. He retained local conservative talk radio host Marshall Gilbert (heard regularly on KNWQ) as his campaign manager in a successful bid that not only put Bono back in the public eye, but fueled his later campaign for a seat on the United States Congress, a position he held until his death in a skiing accident in 1998. His widow, Mary (now Mary Bono Mack), filled the vacancy left by her husband and later campaigned successfully on her own. She was defeated by Democrat Raul Ruiz in the 2012 election, and moved to Florida. Both Sonny Bono and Frank Sinatra are buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City.

The La Quinta Resort and Club, a series of bungalows built in 1926 in what was then known as Marshall&#x27;s Cove is the oldest resort in the valley. Frank Capra wrote the script for 1937 &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; poolside there, in the La Quinta Cove where the resort is located. Capra died in La Quinta and is buried in the nearby Coachella Valley Public Cemetery.

So fond was Walt Disney of his property at the Smoke Tree Ranch in Palm Springs that he often wore a tie tac which was in the shape of the Smoke Tree Ranch logo. Disney reluctantly sold the property to help finance the construction of Disneyland. &quot;Partners&quot;, bronze sculptures of Disney standing next to Mickey Mouse in each of the Disney theme parks clearly show the brand on Disney&#x27;s tie tac.

Clint Eastwood formerly owned a restaurant called the Hog&#x27;s Breath Inn in Old Town La Quinta. The restaurant is currently owned by the Kaiser Restaurant Group, but maintains the Clint Eastwood inspired motif.

TV producer and media mogul Merv Griffin owned a home and ranch which is now part of the PGA West community. It was known as the &quot;Griffin Ranch&quot;, but the land was sold and became an equestrian ranch housing tract and was annexed by the city of La Quinta.

==In popular culture==

Noteworthy and memorable references in popular culture include the animated Looney Tunes short &quot;Bully for Bugs&quot; in which Bugs Bunny requests directions to the Coachella Valley &quot;and the big carrot festival therein.&quot; An annual carrot festival is in fact held just outside the area in the Imperial County town of Holtville, approximately 70 miles to the southeast.

The generation-defining novel &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture&quot;, by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland, describes the angst of those born between roughly 1960 and 1965 (Generation X-ers refers to those born from 1960 to 1982) and is set in the Palm Springs of the late 1980s.

A second classic 1980s novel, &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, a tale of disaffected, rich teenagers of Los Angeles, has its climactic scenes of excess and despair set in Palm Springs. The film &quot;Less than Zero&quot; was made in 1987, directed by Marek Kanievska and starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr. and Jami Gertz.

Parts of &#x27;Highway Dragnet, 1954, were filmed in the Valley.

Another famous movie filmed in the Coachella Valley (as well as Yucca Valley and Twentynine Palms, to the north) is &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;. It even includes the former Desert Air airport, now the site of the Rancho Las Palmas Resort and Spa in Rancho Mirage. The airfield escape scene in &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; was filmed at present-day Palm Springs International Airport; Mount San Jacinto is clearly seen in the background.

Most of Robert Altman&#x27;s 1977 avant-garde drama &quot;3 Women&quot; was shot in the geographical region surrounding Coachella Valley.

Tex Avery made a brief reference to Palm Springs via a sight gag in his 1948 animated short for MGM, &quot;The Cat That Hated People&quot;. In the showroom of the &quot;Moonbeam Rocket Company&quot;, a tiny rocket ship with a sign showing its intended destination of Palm Springs is shown among a series of large rockets also displaying signs indicating not terrestrial but rather their galactic destinations.

The early 1960s would see the movie &quot;Palm Springs Weekend&quot; filmed on location. A humorous situation involving four drunk LAPD policemen in a rented aircraft attempting to reclaim a Palm Springs golf course in the name of the local Indian tribes can be found in the 1975 novel, &quot;The Choirboys&quot;.

An episode of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; titled &quot;The Ruby Yacht of Omar Khayyam&quot; announces the upcoming second installment of the episode as &quot;Rimsky &amp; Korsakov Go to Palm Springs, or Song of Indio&quot;.

In the 1984 music video by Tears for Fears&#x27; &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; was shot on location in the Coachella Valley. The rock video features scenes of a few local landmarks: the dinosaur structures near Cabazon, the windmill farms, scenery along Interstate 10 and state route 111, a scene of two dancers appear in a gas station on state route 86, and the shores of the Salton Sea.

In 1988, &quot;The Race&quot; by Swiss dance band Yello featured a fictitious sportscaster talking about the &quot;thirty-first annual formula race&quot; in Palm Springs. While Palm Springs did briefly host an annual Grand Prix, it ran for considerably fewer than thirty-one years.

In the 1990s two television series shows &quot;P.S. I Luv U&quot; and &quot;Phenom&quot;, the characters and plots were set in Palm Springs.

In 2006, The CW television network had a teen drama series &quot;Hidden Palms&quot; is set in a gated desert community near Palm Springs, although there is a real &quot;Hidden Palms&quot; in Palm Desert. By irony, the real gated community is adjacent to Palm Desert High school.

In local Tyler Hilton&#x27;s song &quot;When It Comes&quot;, he references Palm Desert&#x27;s strip of high-class fashion and dining singing, &quot;When I&#x27;m cruising El Paseo / In my off-white coup back &#x27;65.&quot;

A majority of the 2007 film &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; was shot in Palm Springs.

The helicopter scene in &quot;&quot; was filmed in the windfarm outside of Palm Springs.

The city was mentioned on an episode of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Reno 911!&quot; by sergeant/lieutenant Jim (Doug) Dangle, an openly gay character of the show. He would hang out in Palm Springs, as well in San Francisco and West Hollywood, but he eventually chose Reno as his hometown.

In an episode of the animated comedy &quot;Family Guy&quot; &quot;On the Road to Rhode Island&quot;, baby Stewie and his friend, Brian (a talking dog) figured a way to return home from vacation in Lois&#x27; parents home in Palm Springs.

On &quot;American Dad!&quot; Season 2, Episode 4 – &quot;Lincoln Lover&quot;, Stan Smith said to a speech in the Republican National Convention when representatives of the Gay Log Cabin Republicans were present: &quot;Invite half of Palm Springs...oh, invite everyone in Palm Springs...&quot; based on a belief based on a survey by a demographic think tank on about Half of the city&#x27;s population are Gay or GLBT people.

In the game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, the Coachella Valley area is represented as Sandy Shores in the Grand Theft Auto franchise, and therefore some characteristics of Coachella Valley is mirrored in the Sandy Shores area in the game.

<text>Judith Susan Sheindlin ( Blum; born October 21, 1942), also known as Judge Judy, is an American attorney, court-show arbitrator, media personality, television producer, and former prosecutor and Manhattan family court judge.

For 25 seasons, from September 16, 1996, to July 23, 2021, Sheindlin starred in her eponymous top Nielsen-rated court show, &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. Sheindlin became the longest-serving television arbitrator in courtroom-themed programming history, a distinction that earned her a place in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2015. She received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy in 2019 for her work.

On November 1, 2021, Sheindlin launched the spinoff streaming series &quot;Judy Justice&quot; on IMDb TV (now Amazon Freevee), another arbitration-based reality court show in which she handles legal disputes. After winning the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program in 2022 for the first season of &quot;Judy Justice&quot;, she became the only television arbitrator to have won the award for more than one court show: three for &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and one for &quot;Judy Justice.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Sheindlin was born Judith Susan Blum in Brooklyn, to parents of German Jewish and Russian Jewish descent. She describes her dentist father, Murray (1917-1989), as &quot;the greatest thing since sliced bread&quot;. Sheindlin describes her mother Ethel (1921-1980), an office manager, as &quot;a meat and potatoes kind of gal&quot;.

Sheindlin graduated from James Madison High School in Brooklyn in 1961 and American University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in government. She next attended New York Law School, earning her Juris Doctor degree in 1965.

==Legal career==
Sheindlin passed the New York state bar examination in 1965 and was hired as a corporate lawyer for a cosmetics firm. Within two years, she became dissatisfied with her job and left to raise her children Jamie and Adam. In 1972, she became a prosecutor in the New York family-court system after hearing about the job from a friend. In her role as a lawyer, Sheindlin prosecuted cases involving child abuse, domestic violence and juvenile offenders.

By 1982, Sheindlin&#x27;s attitude inspired New York mayor Ed Koch to appoint her as a criminal-court judge. Four years later, she was promoted to supervising judge in the family court&#x27;s Manhattan division. She earned a reputation as a tough New York City judge (although she has disagreed with the labels &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;harsh&quot;).

==Entertainment career==
In February 1993, Sheindlin&#x27;s reputation made her the subject of a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article written by Josh Getlin (inspired by his wife Heidi, both of whom Sheindlin credits with her rise to fame) that profiled her as a woman determined to make the court system work for the common good. She was then featured in a segment on CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that brought her national recognition. This led to her first book, &quot;Don&#x27;t Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It&#x27;s Raining&quot;, published in 1996. She retired as a family-court judge that same year after having heard more than 20,000 cases.

===&quot;Judge Judy&quot;===


A little over a year after the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; special, Sheindlin accepted an offer in 1995 to preside in a new reality courtroom series, featuring &quot;real cases with real rulings.&quot; Her syndicated court show &quot;Judge Judy&quot; debuted on September 16, 1996 and ran for 25 seasons until July 23, 2021. She was accompanied by her bailiff, Petri Byrd, simply called &quot;Byrd&quot; or &quot;Officer Byrd&quot;, who became the longest-serving bailiff in courtroom programming history. Their work relationship predated the program, as Byrd had served as Sheindlin&#x27;s bailiff in the Manhattan family-court system.

Through its 25-season run, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; remained the top Nielsen-rated court show and regularly drew nine to ten million viewers daily, occasionally besting the ratings of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. From 2009 to its series finale in 2021, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; was the highest-rated show in all of daytime television programming and first-run syndication. During the show&#x27;s active run, author Brendan I. Koerner commented on its popularity:

Court-show viewers don&#x27;t seem to want moral conundrums or technical wrinkles. They love Sheindlin&#x27;s show because she offers them a fantasy of how they&#x27;d like the justice system to operate—swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.

A 2013 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; poll revealed that Americans trusted Judge Judy more than they did all nine justices of the United States Supreme Court.

In 2003, VH1 named Sheindlin in its 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons list. References to Sheindlin have appeared in many television programs, including &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!,&quot; &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, the Academy Awards telecasts, &quot;Betty White&#x27;s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday&quot;, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;.

The &quot;Judge Judy&quot; courtroom series earned Sheindlin numerous awards and honors, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 2006, induction into &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot;s Hall of Fame in October 2012, an award from the vice presidency of the UCD Law Society in April 2013, the Gracie Allen Tribute Award from the Alliance for Women in Media and the Mary Pickford Award from the Hollywood Chamber Community Foundation at the 2014 Heroes of Hollywood.

On June 14, 2013, &quot;Judge Judy&quot; won its first Daytime Emmy Award after having received its 15th nomination. The program won again in 2016 and 2017. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; (ET) on May 3, 2013, Sheindlin was asked about her failure to win after 14 nominations and said:

On September 14, 2015, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognized Sheindlin as the longest-serving judge or arbiter in courtroom-themed programming history and as having the longest-running courtroom show.

Sheindlin has drawn considerable attention and made headlines over her substantial salary from the program. In early 2005, Sheindlin&#x27;s salary was reportedly US$25 million per year. Her net worth at the beginning of 2007 was $95 million, and she ranked No. 13 on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of the 20 richest women in entertainment. In January 2008 when Sheindlin&#x27;s contract was renewed, her salary increased to $45 million per year.

Sheindlin briefly considered retirement in early 2010. Her contract was set to end after the 2013-14 television season. She was quoted at the time as stating, &quot;I think 2013 would be a nice time. It&#x27;s nice to leave on top. I would consider this a great adventure.&quot;

On March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was admitted to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she had suffered a mini-stroke.

In May 2011, Sheindlin&#x27;s contract was extended through the 19th season with an annual salary increase by CBS to $47 million. Her annual salary translated into just over $900,000 per workday (she worked 52 days per year taping cases for &quot;Judge Judy&quot;). According to Forbes, Sheindlin earned $147 million (pretax) in 2017. It was reported by &quot;TV Guide Magazine&quot; in October 2013 that Sheindlin was the highest-paid TV star. She later stated that her retirement was up to her viewers and said that fans still seemed to be interested. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m not tired. I still feel engaged by what I do, and I still have people who like to watch it.&quot;

In August 2017, CBS Television Distribution and Sheindlin signed a contract extension through the 2020-21 television season. She later revealed in a March 2020 appearance on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that the series would conclude by its 25th-season anniversary. The final taped case aired on June 8, 2021, and the series finale aired on July 23, 2021. Sheindlin ended the series while discontented with ViacomCBS and facing lawsuits from Rebel Entertainment, also stating that &quot;25 is a good round number&quot; with which to finish.

To honor the 25th and final season of the series, Josh Getlin (writer of the 1993 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article that brought Sheindlin into the spotlight) wrote another article on Sheindlin. The article was posted on June 8, 2021 (the same day on which the final taped case aired) and explained the background of the 1993 article and Getlin&#x27;s relationship with Sheindlin.

===&quot;Judy Justice&quot;===

Premiering on November 1, 2021, with production that commenced in July 2021 (shortly after production of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; ended in April 2021), Sheindlin currently presides over another arbitration-based courtroom series, &quot;Judy Justice&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. The program is aired through streaming service Amazon Freevee (originally under the name IMDb TV during the show&#x27;s first season). It is the first standard court show to air first-run episodes exclusively through streaming.

The court show has been characterized as a &quot;hip&quot; rendition of &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, featuring Gen Z input from Sheindlin&#x27;s young-adult granddaughter, frequent use of a stenographer to quote testimony to settle discrepancies, Sheindlin&#x27;s conspicuous robe color, a modernized courtroom set and cases that have been described as more sensational because of fewer time constraints and higher monetary award limits than on &quot;Judge Judy&quot;.

While Sheindlin has promised to use the same adjudicating techniques that she had employed on &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, she has lessened her no-nonsense approach, delving deeper into case details, with most episodes focusing on a single long case. Her previous program typically hosted two cases per episode and was known for its aggressive pacing.

After a pre-series debut trailer was released on September 30, 2021, &quot;Judy Justice&quot; drew early criticism from much of Sheindlin&#x27;s &quot;Judge Judy&quot; fanbase over the absence of Bailiff Byrd; Kevin Rasco serves as Sheindlin&#x27;s &quot;Judy Justice&quot; bailiff. In October 2021, Byrd stated that he was &quot;confused&quot; and &quot;dismayed&quot; by Sheindlin&#x27;s lack of communication with him regarding the spinoff. Byrd claimed that Sheindlin omitted him from the series for monetary reasons. In a public statement, Sheindlin praised Byrd as &quot;terrific&quot;, but added that the show needed a new and exciting direction. Byrd ultimately expressed that he held no grudges, was grateful to Sheindlin and wished her luck with &quot;Judy Justice&quot;.

On April 28, 2022, it was announced that Byrd would appear in &quot;Tribunal Justice&quot;, a courtroom series created and produced by Sheindlin and her production team. &quot;Tribunal Justice&quot; will feature former &quot;Hot Bench&quot; judges Tanya Acker and Patricia DiMango along with Sheindlin&#x27;s son, former district attorney Adam Levy.

In April 2022, viewership of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; reruns was found to have vastly outperformed that of &quot;Judy Justice&quot;&#x27;s first season. However, the first season of &quot;Judy Justice&quot; set a record for the number of streaming hours viewed on IMDb TV for its first season, and was thus granted a second season, which premiered on November 7, 2022. Sheindlin won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program for the first season of the series, making her the only television arbitrator to have won the award for more than one court show (both &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Judy Justice&quot;).

==External media appearances and participation==
Sheindlin has been interviewed on many talk and news broadcasts over the course of her career, on programs such as &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;, &quot;Katie&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;The Roseanne Show&quot;, &quot;The View&quot;, &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, &quot;The Talk&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. On October 17, 1998, Sheindlin made a surprise guest appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, comedically interrupting Cheri Oteri&#x27;s parody of her on &quot;Judge Judy.&quot; That same year, Sheindlin appeared as herself in a cameo scene from the &quot;Judge Judy&quot; show in the 1998 American made-for-television crime drama film &quot;CHiPs &#x27;99&quot;. She also served as a judge for the 1999 Miss America pageant.

On February 21, 2000, a 60-minute documentary film about Sheindlin&#x27;s life and career titled &quot;Judge Judy: Sitting in Judgment&quot; aired as part of the &quot;Biography&quot; series. On December 23, 2008, Sheindlin was a guest on &quot;Shatner&#x27;s Raw Nerve&quot;. In December 2009, Sheindlin again told her story in a two-hour interview for the &quot;Archive of American Television&quot;. She launched a short-lived advice-sharing website, whatwouldjudysay.com, in May 2012. In a September 17, 2013 interview with Katie Couric for the 92nd Street Y, Sheindlin elaborated on previously undisclosed facts of her life story and career in the family court.

In 2014, Sheindlin founded her own production company, Queen Bee Productions, which produced the arbitration-based reality courtroom series &quot;Hot Bench&quot;. Sheindlin had originally desired the title of &quot;Hot Bench&quot; for her &quot;Judge Judy&quot; show. &quot;Hot Bench&quot;, which debuted on September 15, 2014, featured a panel of three judges debating and deciding on courtroom cases. Sheindlin stated, &quot;When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three-judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds to serve as the judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench.&quot; The original panel of judges consisted of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman, but Bakman was replaced by Michael Corriero. As with &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, &quot;Hot Bench&quot; was produced by Randy Douthit and CBS Television Distribution.

On August 31, 2016, it was reported that CBS had planned a scripted, semi-autobiographical drama series based on the life of Sheindlin titled &quot;Her Honor&quot;. The show was described as following the youngest judge in New York who, while proficient at handling family court cases, has a personal life that needs work. Executive producers of the program were to include Sheindlin, Chernuchin, Arnold Kopelson and Anne Kopelson. Chernuchin was a writer for the legal drama series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

In 2017, Sheindlin created a game show titled &quot;IWitness&quot; that debuted on July 10 and ran for six weeks. The show tested contestants&#x27; observational skills, requiring them to view video clips and recall what they have witnessed faster than do their competitors. On September 17, 2017, Sheindlin appeared on the series premiere of Fox News&#x27; &quot;Objectified&quot;, hosted by Harvey Levin. The program&#x27;s first episode took an inside look at Sheindlin&#x27;s life.

In September 2017, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; issued a formal apology for having published false statements defaming Sheindlin as having cheated on her husband and having suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and brain damage. The magazine also apologized to Sheindlin&#x27;s daughter Nicole for having stated that she had a prison record.

Sheindlin and her program appeared on a November 26, 2017, episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, presiding over a sketch-comedy court case with Larry David as the plaintiff. The case took the appearance of an actual case from Sheindlin&#x27;s program, with its courtroom set, voiceover briefs, theme music and audience response.

In 2018, Sheindlin appeared as a guest on &quot;Norm Macdonald Has a Show&quot; on Netflix.

==Non-media projects and community work==
Sheindlin, along with her stepdaughter Nicole Sheindlin, is the creator, director and spokeswoman for an alliance designed to empower young women entitled &quot;Her Honor Mentoring.&quot;

In September 2017, Sheindlin funded a space for public debate at the University of Southern California. The purpose of the forum was for &quot;free exchange of ideas by well-meaning people.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1964, Judy married Ronald Levy, who later became a prosecutor in juvenile court. They moved to New York and had two children, Jamie Hartwright and Adam Levy. Her son Adam is a former district attorney for Putnam County, New York, and is now a co-star in &quot;Tribunal Justice&quot;. Judy and Levy divorced in 1976 after 12 years of marriage.

In 1978, she married Judge Jerry Sheindlin, who later became an arbitrator on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; from 1999 to 2001. They divorced in 1990, partially as a result of the stress and struggles that Judy endured after her father&#x27;s death that same year. They remarried in 1991. She has three stepchildren with Sheindlin: Gregory Sheindlin, Jonathan Sheindlin, and Nicole Sheindlin, 13 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Jonathan is a retinal surgeon, and Greg and Nicole are lawyers. Nicole is the co-creator (along with her stepmother) of the Her Honor Mentoring program.

Sheindlin owns homes in several states, including New York, Florida, California, and Wyoming. She commuted to Los Angeles every other week for two to four days to tape episodes of &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. In May 2013, she bought a $10.7 million condominium in the Los Angeles suburb of Beverly Hills. In 2018, Sheindlin and her husband announced spending $9 million on the Bird House, a property on in Newport, Rhode Island, once owned by Dorrance Hill Hamilton.

Sheindlin holds honorary Doctor of Law degrees from Elizabethtown College and the University at Albany, SUNY. In 2013, she was made vice-president of the law society at University College Dublin, Ireland, in recognition of her work in family law.

Sheindlin is a registered Independent. She is a supporter of same-sex marriage, and although she has said that she is not a supporter of &quot;big government&quot;, she believes that the issue of same-sex marriage should be handled at the federal level rather than on a state-by-state basis. Sheindlin has stated that she is in favor of increasing requirements for gun ownership. She prefers not to be labelled by political terms, and states that she is not registered with any political party. When asked about the 2012 presidential elections, Sheindlin stated that while she voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 (as well as voting for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, respectively in 1980 and 1984, and 1992 and 1996), she did not care for either of the leading candidates in the 2012 United States presidential election. In October 2019, Sheindlin penned an op-ed endorsing Michael Bloomberg for President, despite the fact that he had not announced a campaign. In January 2020, she released an advertisement supporting him. In the 2024 election, she endorsed candidate Nikki Haley for President and joined her at a rally in New Hampshire.

===Lawsuits===
In March 2013, a lawsuit was filed against Sheindlin by Patrice Jones, the estranged wife of Randy Douthit (executive producer of Sheindlin&#x27;s &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and later &quot;Judy Justice&quot; court shows). Jones alleged Douthit and Sheindlin had conspired to permit Sheindlin to buy Christofle fine china and Marley cutlery owned by Jones. She said Sheindlin had paid Douthit $50,815 for the items without her knowledge to deprive her of her valuables, and she sought $514,421 from Sheindlin. The suit was settled out of court after Sheindlin returned the tableware to Douthit, and Jones agreed to pay him $12,500 and have the tableware returned to her.

On March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed a lawsuit against Hartford, Connecticut, personal injury lawyer John Haymond and his law firm. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in advertisements that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. Sheindlin&#x27;s producer allegedly told the firm that use of her image is not permitted in March 2013, but ads continued to be produced. The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring program. Sheindlin further stated, &quot;Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better. The unauthorized use of my name is outrageous and requires legal action.&quot; Haymond later filed a countersuit for punitive damages and attorney&#x27;s fees, alleging defamation of him and his firm by Sheindlin. Haymond insisted that local affiliates asked him to appear in &quot;Judge Judy&quot; promos to promote Sheindlin for which he obliged. On August 8, 2014, it was reported that the case between Sheindlin and Haymond settled out of court in a resolution that favored Sheindlin. Haymond donated money to Sheindlin&#x27;s charity, Her Honor Mentoring.

<doc id="750609" wikidata="Q674233" url="?curid=750609" title="North Shore (2004 TV series)">
<text>North Shore is an American prime-time soap opera that aired on Fox on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST (7 p.m. CST) for seven months in 2004 and 2005. It centered on the staff and guests of the fictional Grand Waimea Hotel and Resort (actually the real-life Turtle Bay Resort located near Kahuku, O&#x27;ahu) on Oahu&#x27;s North Shore in Hawaii.

From Fox&#x27;s website:
: Intrigue abounds at the Grand Waimea Hotel, an exclusive Hawaiian escape for the wealthy, powerful and beautiful. Hawaiian native Jason Matthews runs the hotel and makes sure every guest gets everything they need. But when former flame Nicole Booth arrives as the hotel&#x27;s new Director of Guest Relations, Jason&#x27;s world is turned upside down. But Grand Waimea owner, Vincent Colville, is staying on top of him to make sure his past with Nicole won&#x27;t affect their work life.

&quot;North Shore&quot; premiered on June 14, 2004, with a 13-episode commitment from Fox. The show was canceled in January 2005 after a 21-episode, single-season run. The show ended on a cliffhanger, and the final episode of the series has only had a single airing, not being shown in most territories (including America).

==Plot==
The central character is Jason Matthews, General Manager of the Grand Waimea. In the first episode, Nicole Booth is hired as the new Director of Guest Relations. She is the daughter of a ruthless billionaire, and an old flame of Jason&#x27;s who broke his heart years before. At the end of the first episode, Nicole reveals to Jason that she broke up with him because her father wanted her to date someone more successful, and he threatened to have Jason fired from the hotel he was working at the time. The chances for rekindled romance are then dashed when Nicole reveals she has become engaged since they broke up.

Later in the series, Nicole told Jason that she returned to Hawaii to seek him out before getting married, because she wanted to know if there was still a chance for their relationship.

==Cast and characters==

===Main===
* Kristoffer Polaha as Jason Matthews, the General Manager of the Grand Waimea, who shares a past with Nicole.
* Brooke Burns as Nicole Booth, the new Director of Guest Relations, and Jason&#x27;s former flame who broke his heart years before.
* Corey Sevier as Gabriel McKay, a lifeguard (he seems to alternate between guarding the pool and the beach); in episode three it was mentioned that he is planning to &quot;turn pro&quot; as a surfer. He does end up turning pro, with varying degrees of success.
* Nikki DeLoach as MJ Bevans, a waitress at the hotel bar; she is trying to start her own island clothing line. She starts the show in a relationship with Chris, but they end up breaking up. However, they get back together by the end of the show/season.
* Jason Momoa as Frankie Seau, the hotel bartender. He ends the season involved with Tessa.
* Jay Kenneth Johnson as Chris Remsen, MJ&#x27;s nascent boyfriend and proprietor of an extreme sports business. Despite breaking up, they end up back together by the final episode.

* Amanda Righetti as Tessa Lewis, a former con artist who manipulates her way into the Assistant Concierge position. By the end of the show, she is involved with Frankie.
* James Remar as Vincent Colville, the hotel owner; he was in love with Nicole&#x27;s mother before her family forced her to marry Walter Booth.

===Recurring===
* Michael Ontkean as Gordy Matthews, Jason&#x27;s father and a local surfing legend who owns a local bar and surfboard shop; his home was burned down in the first season and Jason suspects Walter Booth was involved.
* Josh Hopkins as Morgan Holt, Nicole&#x27;s fiancé who works for her father in New York as Head of Hotel Acquisitions. Morgan visited the hotel for an extended period, and his relationship with Jason vacillated from friendly to hostile and vice versa several times. Nicole left Morgan at the altar during the first season. He hasn&#x27;t been seen since.
* Robert Kekaula as Sam, the head of hotel security.
* Christopher McDonald as Walter Booth, Nicole&#x27;s billionaire father who wants to buy the Grand Waimea by whatever means necessary; he and Vincent have a long-standing rivalry dating back to Vincent&#x27;s affair with Walter&#x27;s wife; Vincent is convinced Walter killed his wife as revenge. He ends up in jail.
* Shannen Doherty as Alexandra Hudson, Walter Booth&#x27;s supposed illegitimate child by a secretary – thus making her Nicole&#x27;s half-sister. She conspires with her father to take over the Grand Waimea. She ends up in a position of power in the hotel. Though none of the other characters, with the exception of Chris whom she briefly dates, really like her, a few do respect her.
* Dominic Purcell as Tommy Ravetto

===Guest stars===
* Dylan Bruno as Trey, MJ&#x27;s former boyfriend and pro surfer. He tries to win MJ back, even kidnapping her at one point, before she is rescued by Chris and Gabriel.

==Episodes==
==Critical reception==
Critics described the series as &quot;soapy&quot;. &quot;Mediaweek&quot; called it &quot;a cardboard drama about a bunch of pretty, shallow twenty-somethings populating a hotel in Hawaii&quot;, noting that it lacked &quot;characters with problems the audience can relate to&quot; and arguing that &quot;&quot;North Shore&quot; needs to find a better balance of escape and realism to succeed&quot;.

<text>Joseph Donald Mascis Jr. (born December 10, 1965), better known as J Mascis, is an American musician who is the singer, guitarist and main songwriter for the alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr. He has also released several albums as a solo artist and played drums and guitar on other projects. He was ranked number 74 in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists&quot;, and number 5 in a similar list for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine in 2012.

== Biography ==
Mascis was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, the son of a dentist, and grew up in the same area together with his sister Patty and older brother Mike. His mother, Theresa (an avid golfer), died in 1985 while his father, Joseph Sr., died in 1993.

Mascis became a music fan and drumming enthusiast at the age of 9. He later joined the jazz ensemble in school as a drummer. At 17, Mascis joined the short-lived hardcore group Deep Wound with Lou Barlow, Scott Helland, and Charlie Nakajima in the early 1980s. He went on to found Dinosaur Jr. with bassist Barlow and drummer Emmett Jefferson &quot;Patrick&quot; Murphy (aka &quot;Murph&quot;) in 1984, switching to guitar in the process, and they achieved national success. His vocals have been described as &quot;Neil Young-like&quot; and his guitar riffs as &quot;monolithic&quot;. Mascis dismissed Barlow from Dinosaur Jr. in 1989 and over the next eight years recorded several more Dinosaur Jr. albums, as well as the 1996 acoustic solo album &quot;Martin + Me&quot;. In 1989 Kurt Cobain suggested that Mascis join Nirvana as a guitarist.

The manager for Deep Wound was Gerard Cosloy, who then went on to found Homestead Records. Homestead released Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s first record. Mascis says that the reason why Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s sound is not fully formed on that record is that they were more or less automatically signed to Homestead. Megan Jasper, vice president at Sub Pop Records, characterises this period as &quot;J had some anger, like any punk rock kid. Usually, though, when a young person is angry, they tend to be really loud. And J wasn&#x27;t. He was only loud when he played music&quot;.

As a side project, he was the drummer in Boston doom metal group Upsidedown Cross, who released a self-titled album on Taang! Records in 1991. He wrote songs for the film &quot;Gas Food Lodging&quot;, in which he made a cameo appearance. In 1996, he had a small part in the movie &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot; and provided a ballad and a Beach Boys-like song for the soundtrack. In 1998, he retired the Dinosaur Jr. name.

In April 2005 Mascis, Barlow, and Murph reformed the band for a tour celebrating the re-release of the group&#x27;s first three albums. The reunited line-up has since released five new albums: &quot;Beyond&quot; in 2007, &quot;Farm&quot; in 2009, &quot;I Bet on Sky&quot; in 2012, &quot;Give a Glimpse of What Yer Not&quot; in 2016, and &quot;Sweep It Into Space&quot; in 2021.

=== Solo material ===

In 2000 he began producing albums with his new band, J Mascis + The Fog. In 2003, the house and studio he owned burned down.

In August 2005 Mascis released &quot;J and Friends Sing and Chant for Amma&quot;, a solo album under the J Mascis and Friends banner. The album consists of devotional songs dedicated to Hindu religious leader Mata Amritanandamayi, or Ammachi, about whom he had written &quot;Ammaring&quot; on the first J Mascis + The Fog album &quot;More Light&quot;. The proceeds from the album are being donated to tsunami relief efforts Ammachi&#x27;s organization is spearheading. In 2008 the six-track album was made available digitally on his own Baked Goods label.

In 2006 Mascis returned to drumming with his newly formed heavy metal band Witch for their self-titled debut album.

Also that year, he collaborated with Evan Dando on a new Lemonheads album. &quot;The Lemonheads&quot; was released that September, featuring Mascis playing lead guitar.

In 2010 Mascis joined with John Petkovic and Tim Parnin of Cobra Verde and Dave Sweetapple of Witch to form Sweet Apple. The self-titled debut album was released on Tee Pee Records. Mascis plays drums, guitar, and sings on the album.

Mascis released a mostly acoustic album in March 2011 titled &quot;Several Shades of Why&quot; on Sub Pop Records. He was joined in the studio by several guest musicians, including Kurt Vile, Ben Bridwell and Sophie Trudeau. Mascis toured North America with Vile as support act to promote the album. In 2013 Richard Ayoade cast J Mascis in a small role, a caretaker, in his film &quot;The Double&quot;. Mascis&#x27;s electric guitar work is featured on the 2014 Strand of Oaks album &quot;Heal&quot;.

In April 2014 he played with reunited Nirvana on a secret gig after the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions. He sang the songs &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; and &quot;Drain You&quot;. In August 2014 he released the solo album &quot;Tied to a Star&quot; on Sub Pop and toured in support of it.

Mascis joined Unknown Instructors on their fourth album, replacing Joe Baiza as guitarist. The album, &quot;Unwilling to Explain&quot;, was released in 2019.

== Personal life ==
Mascis&#x27;s wife, Luisa Mascis, née Reichenheim, whom he met in New York in the mid-1990s and married in 2004, is from Berlin, Germany. They reside in Amherst, Massachusetts, in a house formerly owned by Robert Thurman, a professor of religion noted for his work on Buddhism, and father of actress Uma Thurman. In September 2007 they had a baby boy named Rory. His brother-in-law is German filmmaker Philipp Reichenheim, professionally known as Philipp Virus, the director of the 2006 Dinosaur Jr. DVD &quot;Live in the Middle East&quot;. He is a devotee of Mata Amritanandamayi, a Hindu guru and author. Mascis explained that he discovered her in the mid-1990s when &quot;I was at my lowest, as the band got bigger, I got more depressed. I was looking for anyone to help, to feel better&quot;.

In 1982 Mascis became straight edge, part of a hardcore punk associated subculture whose adherents avoid drug and alcohol consumption. Since then, he has mostly been a teetotaler and never used other recreational drugs.

== Signature guitars ==
July 2007 saw the release of a signature guitar by Fender, the J Mascis Signature Jazzmaster. The instrument comes in a Purple Sparkle finish and, while otherwise visually similar to a standard Jazzmaster, features a few modifications J requested.

December 2011 saw the release of the Squier by Fender J Mascis Jazzmaster. This features a basswood body, C-shaped maple neck, rosewood fingerboard with 9.5&quot; radius and 21 jumbo frets, two high output single-coil Squier Jazzmaster pickups, three-position switching and dual tone circuits, gold anodized aluminum pickguard, aged white plastic parts (knobs, switch tip, pickup covers), Adjusto-Matic™ bridge with vintage-style floating tremolo tailpiece, vintage-style tuners, chrome hardware, Vintage White finish, and J Mascis signature on the back of the large &#x27;60s-style headstock. This model was discontinued in 2021. Due to demand and chatter on popular social media platforms, Fender re-released the model in early 2023. As of April 2024, the model continues to be produced.

In August 2021 Fender released a new signature Telecaster. This features an Alder body painted with a blue sparkle finish with a high-gloss polyester finish. It has custom pickups based on a 1958 Telecaster, a mirrored pickguard and a pre-worn Maple neck with a custom thinner profile, 21 frets and a 9.5&quot; radius Maple fingerboard. The neck has a thin, part-worn Nitrocellulose lacquer satin finish. It also features a top-loader bridge.

<text>Ur-Nammu (or Ur-Namma, Ur-Engur, Ur-Gur, Sumerian: ; died 2094 BC) founded the Sumerian Third Dynasty of Ur, in southern Mesopotamia, following several centuries of Akkadian and Gutian rule. Though he built many temples and canals his main achievement was building the core of the Ur III Empire via military conquest, and Ur-Nammu is chiefly remembered today for his legal code, the Code of Ur-Nammu, the oldest known surviving example in the world. He held the titles of &quot;King of Ur, and King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;. His personal goddess was Ninsuna.

== Reign ==

According to the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, Ur-Nammu reigned for 18 years. Year-names are known for 17 of these years, but their order is uncertain. One year-name of his reign records the devastation of Gutium, while two years seem to commemorate his legal reforms (&quot;Year in which Ur-Nammu the king put in order the ways [of the people in the country] from below to above&quot;, &quot;Year Ur-Nammu made justice in the land&quot;).

Among his military exploits were the conquest of Lagash and the defeat of his former masters at Uruk. He was eventually recognized as a significant regional ruler (of Ur, Eridu, and Uruk) at a coronation in Nippur, and is believed to have constructed buildings at Nippur, Larsa, Kish, Adab, and Umma. He was known for restoring the roads and general order after the Gutian period. In the internegum after the fall of the Akkadian Empire a number of cities became independent and an area in the northeast came under the control of Elam. Ur-Nammu in his Sumerian language inscriptions reports defeating a coalition of Kutik-Insusinak, Elamite ruler, and some other cities including Tutub and Eshnunna. It has been suggested that this was another name for the Elamite ruler Puzur-Inshushinak, about whom little is known. There is equal support for the idea that Puzur-Inshushinak with contemporary with Akkad ruler Naram-Sin a century earlier. 
Ur-Nammu was also responsible for ordering the construction of a number of ziggurats, including the Great Ziggurat of Ur. It has been suggested, based on a much later literary composition, that he was killed in battle after he had been abandoned by his army. He was succeeded by his son Shulgi. One known daughter, Ama-barag, married a local man. The other known daughter was consecrated as the en-priestess of Nanna in Ur, taking the clerical name En-nir-gal-an-na (En-nirgal-ana). Two inscriptions found in Ur read:

A later Sumerian literary composition known variously as &quot;The Coronation of Ur-Nammu&quot; and &quot;Ur-Namma D&quot; lists canals built by Ur-Nammu. It is known in three Old Babylonian Period recensions, from Nippur, Ur, and of an unknown provenance. There are a number of known Sumerian literary compositions about Ur-Namma, labeled from A to H. The other important later Sumerian literary work is the &quot;Death of Ur-Nammu&quot; (Ur-Namma A), variously described as a &quot;hymn&#x27;, &quot;lamentation&quot; or &quot;wisdom&quot;. It describes the death, funeral, and passge through the underworld of Ur-Nammu. It is known from about 9 damaged tablets and fragments, held in various museums, which together allow restoration of much of the text. The description of Ur-Nammu&#x27;s death is damaged, vague, and metaphoric, which has not stopped later scholars from interpreting it to say Ur-Nammu died in battle at the hands of his own troops.

==Deification debate==
Ur-Nammu is notable for having been one of the few Mesopotamian kings of the third millennium BC who was not deified after his death. This is testified by the posthumous Sumerian literature which never includes the divine determinative before Ur-Nammu&#x27;s name (this can be seen on the transliterations for the texts on ETCSL), the themes of divine abandonment in &quot;The Death of Ur-Nammu&quot;, and the fact that Shulgi promoted his lineage to members of the legendary Uruk dynasty as opposed to Ur-Nammu. While some translations of Sumerian texts had included the divine determinative before Ur-Nammu&#x27;s name more recent evidence indicates this was a mistaken addition. Despite this, the belief that the king was deified after death has been expressed just as recently, demonstrating a lack of certainty on this issue (though these were written during the same year as the new interpretations of the evidence and thus could not refer to them). Sharlach has more recently noted that favour for Ur-Nammu not having been deified has been accepted by many scholars.

Whatever the current state of the deification debate, Ur-Nammu was clearly worshiped after his death. The palace at Tummal included funerary chapels for Ur-Nammu (e Tum-ma-al Ur-dNamma) and his wife. His wife is known to have been named SI . A.tum, read as Watartum. Building materials came from as far away as Babylon, Kutha, and Adab. The ki-a-nag, or funerary offerings for Ur III ruler Ur-Nammu were carried out at Tummal. As his grave was not found in Ur this has sparked speculation he was buried in Tummal.

==Year names of Ur-Nammu==
Almost all of the year names of Ur-Nammu are known, documenting the major events of his reign. The main year names are:

* &quot;Year Ur-Nammu (became) king&quot;
* &quot;Year Ur-Nammu made justice in the land&quot;
* &quot;Year in which the city wall of Ur was built&quot;
* &quot;Year in which the temple of Nanna was built&quot;
* &quot;Year Gutium was destroyed&quot;
* &quot;Year in which the temple of Enlil was built&quot;
* &quot;Year in which the canal &#x27;en-erin-nun&#x27; was dug&quot;
* &quot;Year in which the temple of Ninsun in Ur was built&quot;
* &quot;Year in which the god Lugal-bagara was brought into his temple&quot;

==The Ur-Nammu Stela==

A portion of the stela fragments were found during excavations at Ur in the 1920s, primarily in 1925, by Leonard Woolley under the auspices of the Joint Expedition of The University Museum and The British Museum in the temple precinct of Nanna.

The first publisher of the stela called it the &quot;Stela of the Flying Angels&quot;. Most fragments were found near the base. Some fragments had been moved and used for other purposes, including door sockets, and found on the Kassite period (c. 1595-1155 BC) levels, over half a millennium later. One side was noticeably better preserved than the other. One large fragment was recovered in the 1932-1933 season. As a few fragments were found in the level from fall of the Ur III Empire the excavator indicated that the stela had been shattered at the end of the reign of the final Ur III ruler Ibbi-Sin (c. 2028–2004 BC) and the pieces later used as convenient construction material by the Kassites.
The limestone slab measures 3 meters high and 1.52 meters across, assuming it has been re-assembled properly. The stela fragments have been assembled several times, beginning in 1927, each time differently. The underlying basis for re-assembly is 1) one face is noticeably better preserved, 2) figures on the stela are larger the higher up they are, and 3) the edges of the stela are smooth. It is believed that there were originally five horizontal registers on each side. The identification and meaning of the surviving scenes has been much debated. When the stela was disassembled in 1989 for study mineralogical analysis showed that several fragments did not in fact belong to the stela. At the same time more fragments then in storage were identified as belonging to the stela of Ur-Nammu. This brought the fragment total to 106 including one fragment held at the British Museum (two others there are suspected as also belonging to the Ur-Nammu stela). This stela and the Utuhegal Stela were excavated at the same time and the finds divided between the sponsors. The issue of what fragments belong to this stela is still open. It is currently held at the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania.
