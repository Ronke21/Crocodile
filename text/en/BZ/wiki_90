<text>This is a list of recipients of the Victoria Cross by nationality. It does not include the Victoria Cross awarded to the American Unknown Soldier of World War I buried in the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. He was awarded the VC posthumously in 1921. This gesture reciprocated the award of the Medal of Honor to the British Unknown Warrior.

The Victoria Cross (VC) is a military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of the British armed forces. A small number of Commonwealth countries still participate in the British (Imperial) honours system and would still be eligible to make Victoria Cross recommendations for their service personnel but none of these countries have ever been awarded the Victoria Cross. The last occasion a Commonwealth country was awarded the Victoria Cross was in 1969 during the Vietnam War and today all Commonwealth countries whose armed forces had been awarded the Victoria Cross under the British honours systems have their own honours systems and their own orders, decorations and medals. The Victoria Cross takes precedence over all other British orders, decorations and medals and may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and although civilians under military command are eligible for the award none has been awarded since 1879. The Victoria Cross has often been presented to the recipient during an investiture by the British monarch. The last award of the reign of King George VI and all awards of the reign of by the late Queen with the exception of the two posthumous awards to the Australian Army during the Vietnam War have been presented by Queen Elizabeth II. The VC has been awarded on 1358 occasions to 1355 individual recipients.

The original Royal Warrant and all warrants to this day contain both expulsion and restoration clauses. Eight recipients between 1861 and 1908 had their awards rescinded and although no award has ever been restored the names of the eight are included in the list. The original warrant did not contain a specific clause regarding posthumous awards, although official policy was to not award the VC posthumously. Between 1857 and 1901, twelve notices were issued in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; regarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy for the South African War 1899–1902, the next of kin of three of the soldiers were sent medals by registered post in 1902. In the same gazette the first three posthumous awards were awarded and also sent to the next of kin. In 1907, the posthumous policy was reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six officers and men. The Victoria Cross warrant was not officially amended to explicitly allow posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.

For a short time in the middle 1800s, the VC was awarded for actions taken not in the face of the enemy. Six were awarded at this time for actions taken not in the face of the enemy. (Campbell Mellis Douglas was one of these recipients.)

Until 1921 the Victoria Cross could not be awarded to women, and to this day no VC has been awarded to members of that gender. With the approval of Queen Victoria, Elizabeth Webber Harris was awarded a gold VC for her valour in nursing cholera-ridden soldiers in India in 1869.

Most Commonwealth countries have now created their own honours systems. Since 1991, three Commonwealth countries; Australia, Canada and New Zealand have created their own operational gallantry awards. In each case, their highest award for most conspicuous bravery was named in honour of the British (Imperial) Victoria Cross; the Victoria Cross for Australia, the Victoria Cross (Canada) and the Victoria Cross for New Zealand. One Victoria Cross for New Zealand was awarded to Willie Apiata on 26 July 2007; four Victoria Crosses for Australia have been awarded to Mark Donaldson, Ben Roberts-Smith, Daniel Keighran and Cameron Baird. All five awards were for actions in Afghanistan. As these are separate medals, they are not included in this list.

Recipients are described in the following list by nationality (birthplace) or (citizenship) or (country of service) or (uncertain) or in the case of New Zealand born Captain Alfred John Shout of the Australian Army by both (birthplace) and (country of service). The country lists are compiled differently with the Australian list only being members of the Australian forces, the Canadian list being members of the Canadian forces including Danish Thomas Dinesen who served in Canadian Army plus others who are considered by Canadians as Canadian recipients, while the English list only includes a few of the many English born recipients who were decorated as members of Commonwealth and Indian forces. There have been 1355 individual recipients including the American unknown who is not listed but the list has 1356 names including Alfred John Shout and another listed twice.

<text>Birding with Bill Oddie was a British TV programme, about natural history, presented by Bill Oddie. Three series and eighteen episodes were made, which ran from 21 February 1997 to 31 March 2000 on BBC Two.

&quot;Birding with Bill Oddie&quot; was only loosely scripted and a lot of Bill&#x27;s dialogue was spontaneous – he would start to talk and the cameraman would film him. The reason that the viewer almost feels that they are in the hide or on the site with Bill, is that video was used rather than film.

It was the first show in the Bill Oddie wildlife trilogy series. The others were &quot;Bill Oddie Goes Wild&quot; and &quot;Bill Oddie&#x27;s How to Watch Wildlife&quot;.

==Episodes==

<doc id="752983" wikidata="Q4394283" url="?curid=752983" title="John Rea (snooker player)">
<text>John Rea (born 5 December 1951) is a retired Scottish professional snooker player.

==Career==
Rea turned professional in 1984, recording his first victory over Jack Fitzmaurice in the Grand Prix; he reached the last 32 of this tournament, losing 1–5 to David Taylor. A run to the last 48 at the UK Championship followed this, but Joe Johnson eliminated Rea 9–6 at this stage.

Rea&#x27;s campaign at the next season&#x27;s UK Championship ended at the first attempt, as he recovered from 4–8 to 8–8, but eventually succumbed 8–9 to three-time world champion Fred Davis, who became, aged seventy-two, the oldest player ever to win a professional match.

He defeated another multiple world champion, Ray Reardon, in the 1986 British Open, but lost in the last 32, 5–0 to John Virgo.

Several quiet years ensued, but the 1988/1989 season provided an upturn in form for Rea; a run to the last 32 at the International Open - where he lost 4–5 to Taylor - was followed by the only professional title of his career - the 1989 Scottish Professional Championship. In his first-round match against Ian Black, he recorded a 147 maximum break. He defeated Murdo MacLeod 9–7 in the final.

In the 1989 World Championship, he defeated Dennis Hughes 10–3, Pat Houlihan 10–5 and Ray Edmonds 10–7 to reach the last 48. Requiring one more victory to make his debut at the Crucible Theatre, Rea was drawn against Steve James but, despite recovering from 2–9 to trail only 7–9, he lost the match 7–10.

The next season bore only £7,563 in prize money, the most notable point being Rea&#x27;s 1–5 loss to three-time world champion John Spencer, in the European Open.

At the 1992 UK Championship, he defeated David Rippon, Brian Cassidy, Les Dodd and Tony Jones before losing 9–3 to Jason Ferguson.

Having won only one match during the 1993/1994 season, he finished it ranked 128th, and lost his place on the main tour, aged 43.

Rea entered the 2011 Scottish Professional Championship when it was revived after a twenty-two year hiatus, but was unable to defend his title, losing his first match 1–5 to Stephen Wylie.

In 2012 and 2015, he entered the World Seniors Championship, losing to Bill Oliver in the former and Mark Davis in the latter.

==Personal life==
Rea owns the Lucky Break snooker club in Clydebank. Guests at Rea&#x27;s club have included Stephen Maguire, who he managed.

<doc id="752991" wikidata="Q624546" url="?curid=752991" title="Entity–relationship model">
<text>An entity–relationship model (or ER model) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. A basic ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between (instances of those entity types).

In software engineering, an ER model is commonly formed to represent things a business needs to remember in order to perform business processes. Consequently, the ER model becomes an abstract data model, that defines a data or information structure that can be implemented in a database, typically a relational database.

Entity–relationship modeling was developed for database and design by Peter Chen and published in a 1976 paper, with variants of the idea existing previously. Today it is commonly used for teaching students the basics of database structure. Some ER models show super and subtype entities connected by generalization-specialization relationships, and an ER model can also be used to specify domain-specific ontologies.

== Introduction ==
An ER model usually results from systematic analysis to define and describe the data created and needed by processes in a business area. Typically, it represents records of entities and events monitored and directed by business processes, rather than the processes themselves. It is usually drawn in a graphical form as boxes (&quot;entities&quot;) that are connected by lines (&quot;relationships&quot;) which express the associations and dependencies between entities. It can also be expressed in a verbal form, for example: &quot;one building may be divided into zero or more apartments, but one apartment can only be located in one building.&quot;

Entities may be defined not only by relationships, but also by additional properties (&quot;attributes&quot;), which include identifiers called &quot;primary keys&quot;. Diagrams created to represent attributes as well as entities and relationships may be called entity-attribute-relationship diagrams, rather than entity–relationship models.

An ER model is typically implemented as a database. In a simple relational database implementation, each row of a table represents one instance of an entity type, and each field in a table represents an attribute type. In a relational database a relationship between entities is implemented by storing the primary key of one entity as a pointer or &quot;foreign key&quot; in the table of another entity.

There is a tradition for ER/data models to be built at two or three levels of abstraction. The conceptual-logical-physical hierarchy below is used in other kinds of specification, and is different from the three schema approach to software engineering.
;Conceptual data model
:This is the highest level ER model in that it contains the least granular detail but establishes the overall scope of what is to be included within the model set. The conceptual ER model normally defines master reference data entities that are commonly used by the organization. Developing an enterprise-wide conceptual ER model is useful to support documenting the data architecture for an organization.
:A conceptual ER model may be used as the foundation for one or more &quot;logical data models&quot; (see below). The purpose of the conceptual ER model is then to establish structural metadata commonality for the master data entities between the set of logical ER models. The conceptual data model may be used to form commonality relationships between ER models as a basis for data model integration.
;Logical data model
:A logical ER model does not require a conceptual ER model, especially if the scope of the logical ER model includes only the development of a distinct information system. The logical ER model contains more detail than the conceptual ER model. In addition to master data entities, operational and transactional data entities are now defined. The details of each data entity are developed and the relationships between these data entities are established. The logical ER model is however developed independently of the specific database management system into which it can be implemented. 
;Physical data model
:One or more physical ER models may be developed from each logical ER model. The physical ER model is normally developed to be instantiated as a database. Therefore, each physical ER model must contain enough detail to produce a database and each physical ER model is technology dependent since each database management system is somewhat different.
:The physical model is normally instantiated in the structural metadata of a database management system as relational database objects such as database tables, database indexes such as unique key indexes, and database constraints such as a foreign key constraint or a commonality constraint. The ER model is also normally used to design modifications to the relational database objects and to maintain the structural metadata of the database.

The first stage of information system design uses these models during the requirements analysis to describe information needs or the type of information that is to be stored in a database. The data modeling technique can be used to describe any ontology (i.e. an overview and classifications of used terms and their relationships) for a certain area of interest. In the case of the design of an information system that is based on a database, the conceptual data model is, at a later stage (usually called logical design), mapped to a logical data model, such as the relational model. This in turn is mapped to a physical model during physical design. Sometimes, both of these phases are referred to as &quot;physical design.&quot;

== Components ==

An may be defined as a thing that is capable of an independent existence that can be uniquely identified, and is capable of storing data. An entity is an abstraction from the complexities of a domain. When we speak of an entity, we normally speak of some aspect of the real world that can be distinguished from other aspects of the real world.

An entity is a thing that exists either physically or logically. An entity may be a physical object such as a house or a car (they exist physically), an event such as a house sale or a car service, or a concept such as a customer transaction or order (they exist logically—as a concept). Although the term entity is the one most commonly used, following Chen, entities and entity-types should be distinguished. An entity-type is a category. An entity, strictly speaking, is an instance of a given entity-type. There are usually many instances of an entity-type. Because the term entity-type is somewhat cumbersome, most people tend to use the term entity as a synonym.

Entities can be thought of as nouns. Examples include a computer, an employee, a song, or a mathematical theorem.

A &quot;relationship&quot; captures how entities are related to one another. Relationships can be thought of as verbs, linking two or more nouns. Examples include an &quot;owns&quot; relationship between a company and a computer, a &quot;supervises&quot; relationship between an employee and a department, a &quot;performs&quot; relationship between an artist and a song, and a &quot;proves&quot; relationship between a mathematician and a conjecture.

The model&#x27;s linguistic aspect described above is used in the declarative database query language ERROL, which mimics natural language constructs. ERROL&#x27;s semantics and implementation are based on reshaped relational algebra (RRA), a relational algebra that is adapted to the entity–relationship model and captures its linguistic aspect.

Entities and relationships can both have attributes. For example, an &quot;employee&quot; entity might have a &quot;Social Security Number&quot; (SSN) attribute, while a &quot;proved&quot; relationship may have a &quot;date&quot; attribute.

All entities except weak entities must have a minimal set of uniquely identifying attributes that may be used as a unique/primary key.

Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) do not show single entities or single instances of relations. Rather, they show entity sets (all entities of the same entity type) and relationship sets (all relationships of the same relationship type). For example, a particular &quot;song&quot; is an entity, the collection of all songs in a database is an entity set, the &quot;eaten&quot; relationship between a child and his lunch is a single relationship, and the set of all such child-lunch relationships in a database is a relationship set.
In other words, a relationship set corresponds to a relation in mathematics, while a relationship corresponds to a member of the relation.

Certain cardinality constraints on relationship sets may be indicated as well.

Physical views show how data is actually stored.

===Relationships, roles, and cardinalities===
Chen&#x27;s original paper gives an example of a relationship and its roles. He describes a relationship &quot;marriage&quot; and its two roles, &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot;.

A person plays the role of husband in a marriage (relationship) and another person plays the role of wife in the (same) marriage. These words are nouns.

Chen&#x27;s terminology has also been applied to earlier ideas. The lines, arrows, and crow&#x27;s feet of some diagrams owes more to the earlier Bachman diagrams than to Chen&#x27;s relationship diagrams.

Another common extension to Chen&#x27;s model is to &quot;name&quot; relationships and roles as verbs or phrases.

===Role naming===
It has also become prevalent to name roles with phrases such as &quot;is the owner of&quot; and &quot;is owned by&quot;. Correct nouns in this case are &quot;owner&quot; and &quot;possession&quot;. Thus, &quot;person plays the role of owner&quot; and &quot;car plays the role of possession&quot; rather than &quot;person plays the role of&quot;, &quot;is the owner of&quot;, etc.

Using nouns has direct benefit when generating physical implementations from semantic models. When a &quot;person&quot; has two relationships with &quot;car&quot; it is possible to generate names such as &quot;owner_person&quot; and &quot;driver_person&quot;, which are immediately meaningful.

===Cardinalities===
Modifications to the original specification can be beneficial. Chen described look-across cardinalities. As an aside, the Barker–Ellis notation, used in Oracle Designer, uses same-side for minimum cardinality (analogous to optionality) and role, but look-across for maximum cardinality (the crow&#x27;s foot).

Research by Merise, Elmasri &amp; Navathe and others has shown there is a preference for same-side for roles and both minimum and maximum cardinalities, and researchers (Feinerer, Dullea et al.) have shown that this is more coherent when applied to n-ary relationships of order greater than 2.

Dullea et al. states: &quot;A &#x27;look across&#x27; notation such as used in the UML does not effectively represent the semantics of participation constraints imposed on relationships where the degree is higher than binary.&quot;

Feinerer says: &quot;Problems arise if we operate under the look-across semantics as used for UML associations. Hartmann investigates this situation and shows how and why different transformations fail.&quot; &quot;(Although the &quot;reduction&quot; mentioned is spurious as the two diagrams 3.4 and 3.5 are in fact the same)&quot; and also &quot;As we will see on the next few pages, the look-across interpretation introduces several difficulties that prevent the extension of simple mechanisms from binary to n-ary associations.&quot;
 Chen&#x27;s notation for entity–relationship modeling uses rectangles to represent entity sets, and diamonds to represent relationships appropriate for first-class objects: they can have attributes and relationships of their own. If an entity set participates in a relationship set, they are connected with a line.

Attributes are drawn as ovals and connected with a line to exactly one entity or relationship set.

Cardinality constraints are expressed as follows:
* a double line indicates a &quot;participation constraint&quot;, totality, or surjectivity: all entities in the entity set must participate in &quot;at least one&quot; relationship in the relationship set;
* an arrow from an entity set to a relationship set indicates a key constraint, i.e. injectivity: each entity of the entity set can participate in &quot;at most one&quot; relationship in the relationship set;
* a thick line indicates both, i.e. bijectivity: each entity in the entity set is involved in &quot;exactly one&quot; relationship.
* an underlined name of an attribute indicates that it is a key: two different entities or relationships with this attribute always have different values for this attribute.

Attributes are often omitted as they can clutter up a diagram. Other diagram techniques often list entity attributes within the rectangles drawn for entity sets.

===Crow&#x27;s foot notation===

Crow&#x27;s foot notation, the beginning of which dates back to an article by Gordon Everest (1976), is used in Barker&#x27;s notation, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), and information technology engineering. Crow&#x27;s foot diagrams represent entities as boxes, and relationships as lines between the boxes. Different shapes at the ends of these lines represent the relative cardinality of the relationship.

Crow&#x27;s foot notation was in use in ICL in 1978, and was used in the consultancy practice CACI. Many of the consultants at CACI (including Richard Barker) came from ICL and subsequently moved to Oracle UK, where they developed the early versions of Oracle&#x27;s CASE tools, introducing the notation to a wider audience.

With this notation, relationships cannot have attributes. Where necessary, relationships are promoted to entities in their own right: for example, if it is necessary to capture where and when an artist performed a song, a new entity &quot;performance&quot; is introduced (with attributes reflecting the time and place), and the relationship of an artist to a song becomes an indirect relationship via the performance (artist-performs-performance, performance-features-song).

Three symbols are used to represent cardinality:
* the &quot;ring&quot; represents &quot;zero&quot;
* the &quot;dash&quot; represents &quot;one&quot;
* the &quot;crow&#x27;s foot&quot; represents &quot;many&quot; or &quot;infinite&quot;

These symbols are used in pairs to represent the four types of cardinality that an entity may have in a relationship. The inner component of the notation represents the minimum, and the outer component represents the maximum.
* &quot;ring&quot; and &quot;dash&quot; → minimum zero, maximum one (optional)
* &quot;dash&quot; and &quot;dash&quot; → minimum one, maximum one (mandatory)
* &quot;ring&quot; and &quot;crow&#x27;s foot&quot; → minimum zero, maximum many (optional)
* &quot;dash&quot; and &quot;crow&#x27;s foot&quot; → minimum one, maximum many (mandatory)
== Model usability issues ==
Users of a modeled database can encounter two well-known issues where the returned results differ from what the query author assumed. These are known as the fan trap and the chasm trap, and they can lead to inaccurate query results if not properly handled during the design of the Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model).

Both the fan trap and chasm trap underscore the importance of ensuring that ER models are not only technically correct but also fully and accurately reflect the real-world relationships they are designed to represent. Identifying and resolving these traps early in the design process helps avoid significant issues later, especially in complex databases intended for business intelligence or decision support.

=== Fan trap ===

The first issue is the fan trap. It occurs when a (master) table links to multiple tables in a one-to-many relationship. The issue derives its name from the visual appearance of the model when it is drawn in an entity–relationship diagram, as the linked tables &#x27;fan out&#x27; from the master table. This type of model resembles a star schema, which is a common design in data warehouses. When attempting to calculate sums over aggregates using standard SQL queries based on the master table, the results can be unexpected and often incorrect due to the way relationships are structured. The miscalculation happens because SQL treats each relationship individually, which may result in double-counting or other inaccuracies. This issue is particularly common in decision support systems. To mitigate this, either the data model or the SQL query itself must be adjusted. Some database querying software designed for decision support includes built-in methods to detect and address fan traps.

=== Chasm trap ===

The second issue is the chasm trap. A chasm trap occurs when a model suggests the existence of a relationship between entity types, but the pathway between these entities is incomplete or missing in certain instances.

For example, imagine a database where a Building has one or more Rooms, and these Rooms hold zero or more Computers. One might expect to query the model to list all Computers in a Building. However, if a Computer is temporarily not assigned to a Room (perhaps under repair or stored elsewhere), it won&#x27;t be included in the query results. The query would only return Computers currently assigned to Rooms, not all Computers in the Building. This reflects a flaw in the model, as it fails to account for Computers that are in the Building but not in a Room. To resolve this, an additional relationship directly linking the Building and Computers would be required.

== In semantic modeling ==

=== Semantic model ===
A semantic model is a model of concepts and is sometimes called a &quot;platform independent model&quot;. It is an intensional model. At least since Carnap, it is well known that: 
:&quot;&quot;...the full meaning of a concept is constituted by two aspects, its intension and its extension. The first part comprises the embedding of a concept in the world of concepts as a whole, i.e. the totality of all relations to other concepts. The second part establishes the referential meaning of the concept, i.e. its counterpart in the real or in a possible world&quot;.&quot;

=== Extension model ===
An extensional model is one that maps to the elements of a particular methodology or technology, and is thus a &quot;platform specific model&quot;. The UML specification explicitly states that associations in class models are extensional and this is in fact self-evident by considering the extensive array of additional &quot;adornments&quot; provided by the specification over and above those provided by any of the prior candidate &quot;semantic modelling languages&quot;.&quot;UML as a Data Modeling Notation, Part 2&quot;

=== Entity–relationship origins ===
Peter Chen, the father of ER modeling said in his seminal paper:
: &quot;&quot;The entity-relationship model adopts the more natural view that the real world consists of entities and relationships. It incorporates some of the important semantic information about the real world.&quot; 

In his original 1976 article Chen explicitly contrasts entity–relationship diagrams with record modelling techniques:
:&quot;The data structure diagram is a representation of the organization of records and is not an exact representation of entities and relationships.&quot;&quot;

Several other authors also support Chen&#x27;s program:

==== Philosophical alignment ====
Chen is in accord with philosophical traditions from the time of the Ancient Greek philosophers: Plato and Aristotle. Plato himself associates knowledge with the apprehension of unchanging Forms (namely, archetypes or abstract representations of the many types of things, and properties) and their relationships to one another.

== Limitations ==
* An ER model is primarily conceptual, an ontology that expresses predicates in a domain of knowledge. 
* ER models are readily used to represent relational database structures (after Codd and Date) but not so often to represent other kinds of data structure (such as data warehouses and document stores)
* Some ER model notations include symbols to show super-sub-type relationships and mutual exclusion between relationships; some do not.
* An ER model does not show an entity&#x27;s life history (how its attributes and/or relationships change over time in response to events). For many systems, such state changes are nontrivial and important enough to warrant explicit specification.
* Some have extended ER modeling with constructs to represent state changes, an approach supported by the original author; an example is Anchor Modeling. 
* Others model state changes separately, using state transition diagrams or some other process modeling technique.
* Many other kinds of diagram are drawn to model other aspects of systems, including the 14 diagram types offered by UML.
* Today, even where ER modeling could be useful, it is uncommon because many use tools that support similar kinds of model, notably class diagrams for OO programming and data models for relational database management systems. Some of these tools can generate code from diagrams and reverse-engineer diagrams from code.
* In a survey, Brodie and Liu could not find a single instance of entity–relationship modeling inside a sample of ten Fortune 100 companies. Badia and Lemire blame this lack of use on the lack of guidance but also on the lack of benefits, such as lack of support for data integration.
* The enhanced entity–relationship model (EER modeling) introduces several concepts not in ER modeling, but are closely related to object-oriented design, like is-a relationships.
* For modelling temporal databases, numerous ER extensions have been considered. Similarly, the ER model was found unsuitable for multidimensional databases (used in OLAP applications); no dominant conceptual model has emerged in this field yet, although they generally revolve around the concept of OLAP cube (also known as &quot;data cube&quot; within the field).

<text>Kendra Slawinski (born 13 December 1962), originally known as Kendra Lowe, is a former England netball international. Between 1983 and 1995 she made 128 senior appearances for England. She represented England at the 1983 and 1987 World Netball Championships and at 1985 and 1989 World Games and captained the team at the 1991 and 1995 World Netball Championships and at the 1993 World Games. In 1996, she was awarded an OBE for her services to netball.

==Early life, family and education==
Slawinski is the daughter of Lili and Kenny Lowe Sr. She was raised in Billingham. Her older brother, Kenny Lowe, is a former England men&#x27;s semi-pro international footballer and Perth Glory manager. Slawinski attended De Montfort University.

==Playing career==
===England===
Between 1983 and 1995, Slawinski made 128 senior appearances for England. She represented England at the 1983, 1987, 1991 and 1995 World Netball Championships and at the 1985, 1989 and 1993 World Games. She captained England at the 1991 and 1995 World Netball Championships and at the 1993 World Games. In 1993 she received her 100th senior cap. In November 1995, she made her 128th and final appearance for England during a series against the Cook Islands. She was the world&#x27;s most capped netball international, until 2009 when she overtaken by New Zealand&#x27;s Irene van Dyk. In 1996, she was awarded an OBE for her services to netball. In 2001 she was an inaugural inductee into England Netball&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Later career==
===Coach===
During the Super Cup era, Slawinski was head coach of Birmingham Blaze. During the 2007–08 Netball Superleague season, Slawinski served as assistant coach when Galleria Mavericks reached the grand final. During the 2008–09 season she was Mavericks head coach, guiding them to another grand final.

===Teacher===
Since 1986, Slawinski has worked as a teacher at Cardinal Newman Catholic School in Luton. On 19 July 2024 after 39 years of outstanding service, she retired from her final position of Assistant Headteacher.

==Bedfordshire Schools Netball Coach==
During the 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s Kendra was the head coach for the 12U, 14U, 16U and 18U Bedfordshire schools Netball squads that trained at Putteridge Sports and Leisure Centre in Luton. She was also the captain of the Bedfordshire Senior Netball squad that trained along with the Bedfordshire U21 squad in the Alexander Sports Hall, Sidney Rd, Bedford.

<text>The Battle of Slankamen was fought on 19 August 1691, near Slankamen in the Ottoman Sanjak of Syrmia (modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia), between the Ottoman Empire, and Habsburg Austrian forces during the Great Turkish War.

The battle saw a Turkish-Transylvanian force led by Emeric Thököly and Mustafa Köprülü suffer an overwhelming defeat by an Imperial army commanded by Ludwig Wilhelm of Baden. The Grand Vizir Mustafa Köprülü was killed by a stray bullet and the Ottoman army routed, leaving behind the war chest and their artillery. The battle was disastrous for the Turks and costly for the Austrians. The victory stabilized the Hungarian front and secured Hungary, Croatia and Transylvania for the Habsburgs.

==Background==
The Ottomans suffered a series of defeats against the Austrians in the 1680s, most notably at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, Buda in 1686, Belgrade in 1688 and Bosnia in 1689. However, with the beginning of the Nine Years War in the west, the early 1690s were to see an end to Habsburg conquests in the Balkans and a partial Ottoman recovery. Many German troops were withdrawn to fight King Louis XIV&#x27; French forces on the Rhine, encouraging the Ottomans, led by the Grand Vizier Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha, to counterattack.

In April 1690 the death of Michael I Apafi In April 1690 pushed the Sultan to nominate Hungarian Emeric Thököly prince of Transylvania, Thököly at the head of an army quickly occupied much of the principality. When the Imperial army left Belgrade to defeat Thököly in September, Köprülü managed to retake Belgrade and massacre the garrison which the Ottomans had lost in 1688.

In August 1691, Ludwig Wilhelm (Türkenlouis) marched down the Danube to provoke the Ottomans into another major battle, after gathering a new Imperial army of 33,000, including a 10,000 strong Serb militia, under the command of vice-voivoda Jovan Monasterlija.

==Battle==
The clash between the two forces took place on the west side of the Danube, opposite the outlet of the Tisa. Both armies deployed near Zemun, but the superior Ottoman army did not attack for two days, the Ottomans lacked the vital Tartar component of their army, which was still travelling south. By withdrawing slowly to a fortified position near Slankamen Ludwig Wilhelm tried to provoke the attack. The Ottomans followed and surrounded the Imperial Army. By 19 August, heat, disease and desertion had reduced both armies to 33,000 and 50,000 able men. On that day the Ottoman cavalry finally attacked.

These were unorganized charges, however; although huge, the Ottoman forces were poorly armed and no match for the firepower of Ludwig Wilhelm&#x27;s German-Austrian infantry and field guns. Additionally, the Ottomans&#x27; supply system was incapable of waging a long war on the empty expanses of the Pannonian plain.

Initially, the Ottomans were at an advantage, as they advanced and burned 800 supply wagons of the Imperial Army. Ludwig Wilhelm, in a desperate situation, broke out of his position, besieged by the Ottomans, and turned their flanks with his cavalry, inflicting fearful carnage. After a hard battle, the 33,000-man Imperial Army was victorious over the larger Ottoman force. The death of Grand Vizier Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha during mid-battle caused the Ottoman morale to drop and the army to disperse and retreat.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Slankamen was the last battle in the war that could have brought it back in Ottomans&#x27; favour. The Austrians took Transylvania but were not able to press their advantage as they had gotten involved with France in the war of the Grand Alliance. The Ottoman defeat eventually lead to the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. For his victories against the Turks Ludwig Wilhelm of Baden earned the nickname (&quot;Turkish Louis&quot;).

==Legacy==
A was built in Slankamen to commemorate the victory of the Imperial Army.

Her work covered a broad array of subjects and included fiction and non-fiction books. Her novels are primarily aimed at children and young adults, but she has also written the text for picture books. While many of her books are set in Northern Ireland where she grew up, her topics and settings range from Thanksgiving to riots in Los Angeles. Bunting&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Two Giants&quot;, was published in 1971. Due to the popularity of her books with children, she has been listed as one of the Educational Paperback Association&#x27;s top 100 authors.

Bunting died of pneumonia in Santa Cruz, California, on October 1, 2023, at the age of 94.

==Literary career==
Bunting went to school in Northern Ireland and grew up with story-telling: &quot;There used to be Shanachies...the Shanachie was a storyteller who went from house to house telling his tales of ghosts and fairies, of old Irish heroes and battles still to be won.

<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) is a military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the presence of the enemy&quot; to members of the Australia Armed Forces. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service, and to civilians under military command. Being the highest award in the Australian Honours Order of Wearing, the VC takes precedence over all other postnominals and Australian orders and decorations. The VC was instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856, initially to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. Because of its rarity and inherent significance, the VC is highly prized, both as an award and as a collector&#x27;s item, with one medal being sold for over A$1 million at auction. Australians have received the VC under the Imperial honours system and later under the Australian Honours System, when in 1991 a new but equivalent award was established by letters patent within the Commonwealth of Australia and its Territories, known as the Victoria Cross for Australia. The Victoria Cross for Australia has been awarded five times: twice to Special Air Service Regiment members, once to a member of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and a posthumous award to a member of the 2nd Commando Regiment, and a posthumous award to Teddy Sheean. The first four were for actions in the War in Afghanistan while Sheean&#x27;s was for actions during World War II.

The Imperial VC has been awarded to 96 Australians—91 were received for actions whilst serving with Australian forces, and another five to former members of the Australian forces then serving with South African and British forces. The majority of the awards were for action in the First World War when a total of 64 medals were awarded. Nine of these awards were for action during the Gallipoli Campaign. 20 medals were awarded for action in the Second World War, 6 in the Second Boer War, 4 in the Vietnam War and 2 in the Russian Civil War. Twenty-eight Australians have been awarded the medal posthumously. One recipient—Captain Alfred Shout VC, MC (who was also Mentioned in Despatches)—was Australia&#x27;s most decorated soldier of the Gallipoli campaign. His Victoria Cross was posthumously awarded after Shout died of his wounds during the Battle of Lone Pine. Another 19 VCs have been awarded to soldiers who were either born in Australia, or died there, but did not serve in Australian units before being awarded the VC, and as such these are not included in this list.

Keith Payne is the only living Australian recipient of the original VC; there are three living recipients of the Victoria Cross for Australia.

<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.

==Background==

Established in 1856, the Victoria Cross has been awarded to service personnel for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force. Between 1858 and 1881 the Victoria Cross could also be awarded for actions taken &quot;under circumstances of extreme danger&quot; not in the face of the enemy. Six people were awarded Victoria Crosses under this clause – one Irish man in 1866 for actions taken during the Fenian raids; five (a Canadian, three Irish and an English man) for a single incident in 1867 during the Andaman Islands Expedition. In 1881, VC regulations were amended to only allow acts &quot;in the presence of the enemy&quot;.

Since 1993, Canadians have no longer been eligible for the Victoria Cross: that medal has been superseded by the Canadian Victoria Crossof equal honour, but yet to be awarded. The scroll of the Canadian medal differs in that the inscription is in Latin rather than English; by using a language that is an ancestor of French and has greatly contributed to the development of English, the medal avoids linguistic discrimination between Canada&#x27;s two official languages. The fleur-de-lis, in heraldry long associated with the French crown has been added at the end each scroll. The actual metal of the medal is a distinct Canadian composition.

==Summary==

According to Veterans Affairs Canada, the Victoria Cross has been presented to 99 Canadians, or people closely associated with Canada, between its creation for acts performed during the Crimean War and 1993 when the Canadian Victoria Cross was instituted. No Canadian has received either honour since 1945. The former solely includes individuals, irrespective of their country of origin, who have served in the Armed Forces of Canada, while the Veterans’ Affairs site broadens the criteria to encompass those born in Canada who have received the VC for their service in the United Kingdom.

The first Canadian to be awarded the Victoria Cross was Alexander Roberts Dunn for his actions at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War in 1854. William Hall, a Nova Scotian, was the first black recipient of the Victoria Cross. The last living Canadian recipient of the British Victoria Cross, &quot;Smokey&quot; Smith, died in August 2005.

Seventy-three Victoria Crosses were awarded to Canadians for their actions in the First World War, and Canadians received sixteen VCs during the Second World War. The remaining recipients were awarded the medal for actions performed in the Crimean War (Battle of Balaclava), the Indian Mutiny (the Indian Rebellion of 1857), a native uprising at a remote Indian Ocean island during the Andaman Islands Expedition, the Battle of Omdurman during the Sudan Campaign of 1896–1899, and the Second Boer War.

Timothy O&#x27;Hea, a 23-year-old Irishman in the British army, fought a fire in a railway car containing 900 kilograms of ammunition stationed at Danville, Quebec during the Fenian raids. O&#x27;Hea is the only VC recipient awarded for actions on Canadian soil.

Seven Canadians were awarded VCs individually on one single day, 2 September 1918, for actions they performed along the 30 km long Drocourt-Quéant Line near Arras, France: Bellenden Hutcheson, Arthur George Knight, William Henry Metcalf, Claude Nunney, Cyrus Wesley Peck, Walter Leigh Rayfield and John Francis Young. Their acts of exceptional valour were performed during Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days of successful offensive campaigning that helped end the war.

<doc id="753017" wikidata="Q1263756" url="?curid=753017" title="Dudley Pope">
<text>Dudley Bernard Egerton Pope (29 December 1925 – 25 April 1997) was a British writer of both nautical fiction and history, most notable for his Lord Ramage series of historical novels. Greatly inspired by C.S. Forester, Pope was one of the most successful authors to explore the genre of nautical fiction, often compared to Patrick O&#x27;Brian.

==Life==

Dudley Pope was born in Ashford, Kent. By concealing his age he joined the Home Guard aged 14 and at age 16 joined the merchant navy as a cadet. His ship was torpedoed the next year (1942). Afterwards, he spent two weeks in a lifeboat with the few other survivors. After he was invalided out the only obvious sign of the injuries he had suffered was a joint missing from one finger due to gangrene. Pope then went to work for a Kentish newspaper, then in 1944 moved to &quot;The Evening News&quot; in London, where he was the naval and defence correspondent. From there he turned to reading and writing naval history.

His first book, &quot;Flag 4&quot;, was published in 1954, followed by several other historical accounts. C. S. Forester, the creator of the famed Horatio Hornblower novels, encouraged Pope to add fiction to his repertoire. In 1965, &quot;Ramage&quot; appeared, the first of what was to become an 18-novel series.

He took to living on boats from 1953 on; when he married Kay Pope in 1954, they lived on a William Fife 8-meter named &quot;Concerto&quot;, then at Porto Santo Stefano, Italy in 1959 with a 42-foot ketch &quot;Tokay&quot;. In 1963 he and Kay moved to a 53-foot cutter &quot;Golden Dragon&quot;, on which they moved to Barbados in 1965. In 1968 they moved onto a 54-foot wooden yacht named &quot;Ramage&quot;, aboard which he wrote all of his stories until 1985.
Pope died 25 April 1997 in Marigot, Saint Martin. Both his wife and his daughter, Jane Victoria survive him.

<text>The Air Force Cross (AFC) is the United States Air Force and United States Space Force&#x27;s second highest military decoration for airmen and guardians who distinguish themselves with extraordinary heroism in combat with an armed enemy force. The medal is awarded to any person, while serving in any capacity with the Air Force or Space Force, who distinguish themselves by heroism which is extraordinary but not sufficient for the award of a Medal of Honor.

The Air Force Cross is equivalent to the U.S. Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Cross, Naval Service&#x27;s Navy Cross, and Coast Guard Cross. Prior to July 6, 1960, members of the Air Force were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

==Origins==
Originally entitled the &quot;Distinguished Service Cross (Air Force)&quot;, the Air Force Cross was first proposed in 1947 after the creation of the United States Air Force in September that year as an independent armed service. The medal was designed by Eleanor Cox, an employee of the Air Force, and was sculpted by Thomas Hudson Jones of the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry.

The Air Force Cross was established by Public Law (PL) 86-593 on 6 July 1960 and made effective through an amendment to Title 10 USC, Section 8742; July 6, 1960, by PL 86–593 in Chapter 857, Sections 8742, 8744 and 8745 of Title 10, USC to substitute &quot;Air Force cross&quot; for &quot;Distinguished-service cross&quot; and inserted &quot;Air Force cross&quot; in Sections 8748 and 8749. Prior to July 6, 1960, United States Air Force airmen were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

Additional awards of the Air Force Cross are annotated by oak leaf clusters.

===Criteria for award===
Title 10, Chapter 857, Section 8742. Air Force Cross: Award

The President may award an Air Force cross of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Air Force or Space Force, distinguishes themselves by extraordinary heroism not justifying the award of a Medal of Honor:
* while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;
* while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or
* while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.

The medal is usually presented by the Secretary of the Air Force in a formal ceremony at the Pentagon.

==Description==
The medal consists of a bronze cross with an oxidized satin finish. Centered on the cross is a gold-plated American bald eagle, wings displayed against a cloud formation (from the crest of the Department of the Air Force Seal) encircled by a laurel wreath finished in green enamel. The reverse side of the medal is blank and may be engraved in capital letters with the recipient&#x27;s rank (abbreviated), first name, middle initial, last name and branch of service.

The ribbon (and service ribbon) is brittany blue, edged with red, and bears a narrow white vertical stripe inside the red edges. The ribbon is almost identical to that of the Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Cross, except for the lighter blue center stripe, indicating the close connection of these awards.

==Awards==
The first award of the Air Force Cross was made posthumously to Air Force Major Rudolf Anderson, an U-2 pilot, for extraordinary heroism during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

As of October 2017 there had been 202 awards of the Air Force Cross to 197 individuals. Three were retroactively awarded for actions in World War II. One hundred eighty were awarded for heroism in the Vietnam War, and four for heroism during the 1975 Mayagüez Incident immediately following (these are sometimes counted with the Vietnam War awards). Two were awarded for the 1991 Gulf War; one, to USAF Pararescueman Timothy Wilkinson, for the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, and three were awarded for heroism during Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan in 2002, two to USAF Pararescuemen Keary Miller and Jason Cunningham and one to special tactics Technical Sergeant John Chapman, a combat controller. One was awarded to combat controller Zachary Rhyner for actions in the Shok Valley, Afghanistan on April 6, 2008. Another was awarded to USAF Pararescueman MSgt Ivan Ruiz for heroism in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, Dec. 10, 2013.

On October 17, 2017, the Air Force Cross was awarded to Staff Sergeant Richard Hunter, for actions against the Taliban in Kunduz province Afghanistan on November 2, 2016. 

On April 20, 2017, SSgt Chris Baradat was presented with the Air Force Cross for his actions in the Sono Valley, Kunar province, on April 6, 2013, while serving as a QRF Combat Controller with the 21st Expeditionary Special Tactics Squadron.

On September 21, 2020, a combat controller, not named, was awarded the Air Force Cross, for actions during the Battle of Khasham.

Fifty awards have been posthumous, including 30 to members missing in action. Twenty-four have been awarded to enlisted personnel, including 12 Pararescuemen. Seventeen graduates of the United States Air Force Academy have been presented the award, and 13 were awarded for conduct while a prisoner of war.

There have been five multiple recipients:

* James H. Kasler (three awards)

* Garry Gordon Cooper (two awards)

<text>NetCaptor was an Internet Explorer shell that was in development from 1997 to 2005. It used the Trident layout engine of Internet Explorer in conjunction with additional programmed features to create an alternate browsing experience with a tab-based interface and an expanded feature set. It was an adware/shareware program, but its developer released a registration key for free public use once development ceased.

== Features ==
The main features are, as of the last released version, 7.5.4:
* Tab-based browsing interface
* QuickSearch: Allows you to perform search engine queries directly from the address bar. For example, to search for &quot;testing&quot; on Google, you would simply type &quot;g testing&quot; into any tab&#x27;s address bar.
* Aliases: Like QuickSearch, except that they do not require you to enter a search term as a parameter. For example, typing &quot;g&quot; would take you to the Google front page. Can be used to replace Favorites.
* Automatic data wiper: Allows you to clear usage data, temporary internet files, cookies, and more whenever NetCaptor is closed. Supports several different file wiping methods.
* CaptorGroups: Essentially, grouped Favorites that can be opened all at once. You could, for example, have several news sites in one single CaptorGroup, then use that group to open all the sites the next time you want to look at news.
* PopupCaptor: Pop-up blocking feature capable of blocking unrequested popups, or filtering them based on URL matches (i.e. all popups from a certain website only).
* URL Blocking: Allows you to prevent anything coming from the specified URL from loading. For example, you can prevent the loading of all data (images, sound, ads, etc.) sent from a certain website.

After development stopped, one of NetCaptor&#x27;s most valued features—a side bar and panel that listed search results—also ceased to function. Most other features continue to work. Its later releases were not Trident-based Internet Explorer shells but resembled Internet Explorer 6 in many ways, except for the tabbed browsing feature. Many people ceased to use &quot;bare&quot; Internet Explorer in favor of NetCaptor because Internet Explorer 6 lacked tabbed browsing natively, which led to Microsoft implementing this feature in the next release, Internet Explorer 7.

== History and development ==
NetCaptor&#x27;s development began under the name SimulBrowse in 1997. SimulBrowse was renamed Netcaptor because the developer didn&#x27;t like the name. Some of the browser&#x27;s features were original, while others were inspired by similar products. According to a statement from developer Adam Stiles, NetCaptor was one of the first browsers to feature a tabbed browsing interface; while similarities were found in other browsers of the era (such as Booklink&#x27;s Internetworks or Opera), NetCaptor&#x27;s tabs were closest in form and function to the tabs found in modern browsers.

NetCaptor was a closed-source program started and maintained by Adam Stiles.

The last released version, 7.5.4, was made available on February 18, 2005. On a post dated January 8, 2008, Stiles officially declared that &quot;NetCaptor is Dead&quot; after 10 years, and &quot;What a ride it&#x27;s been&quot;. Stiles recommended that users switch to the Mozilla Firefox or Safari web browsers. He simultaneously released a free registration key for anyone still wishing to use NetCaptor, but due to the browser&#x27;s tendency to phone home to check registration key validity and the dissolution of the website, the key no longer functions:

There is no legally provided workaround or modification available.

<text>Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro (17 August 1843 – 16 December 1913) was an Italian Cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church, and the last man to have his candidacy for papal election vetoed through &quot;jus exclusivae&quot; by a Catholic monarch.

Rampolla is in the episcopal lineage of Pope Francis.

==Early life==
Born in Polizzi Generosa, Sicily, Rampolla was the son of Ignazio Rampolla, Count of Tindaro, and of his wife, Orsola Errante.

Rampolla entered the Vatican Seminary in 1856, and in 1861 continued his education at the Collegio Capranica and the Pontifical Gregorian University. Having displayed a considerable knowledge in Oriental affairs, he was sent to the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles as preparation for service in the Roman Curia.

In 1866 Rampolla was ordained a priest. He obtained a doctorate &quot;in utroque iure&quot; (Canon Law and Civil Law) in 1870. In 1874 he was named a Canon of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. In 1875, he was sent to Madrid as Auditor of the Apostolic Nunciature to Spain. In 1877 he was named Secretary for Oriental Affairs of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. The following year he was named a Protonotary apostolic &quot;de numero participantium&quot;, the highest rank of monsignor. In 1880 he was named Secretary of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, the Vatican office which deals with areas of the world in which there is no regularly constituted hierarchy of bishops. Then Rampolla was also appointed Secretary of the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, the subsection of the Secretariat of State that deals with the foreign affairs of the Holy See.

On 1 December 1882 Rampolla was appointed titular archbishop of Heraclea in Europa, and on 8 December 1882 was consecrated bishop by Cardinal Edward Henry Howard. This was in preparation for his nomination as Apostolic Nuncio to Spain, which came on 19 December 1882.

==Cardinal==

In the consistory of 14 March 1887, Pope Leo XIII created Rampolla del Tindaro a Cardinal-Priest, and on 26 May assigned him the titular church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. On 2 June he was appointed Secretary of State. In this office, as he had previously in Spain, Rampolla employed Giacomo della Chiesa, the future Benedict XV, as his secretary.

On 21 March 1894, Pope Leo XIII named Cardinal Rampolla Archpriest of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

As Secretary of State, Cardinal Rampolla supported the Austrian Christian Social Party, led by Karl Lueger, sometime mayor of Vienna (1897–1910). Lueger entered office over the disapproval of Emperor Franz Joseph through the personal intervention of Leo XIII. Lueger&#x27;s Christian Social Party was the first Catholic social movement that was both anti-liberal and anti-Semitic. Rampolla began to swing papal policy from support of Austria-Hungary toward support of France, Austria&#x27;s enemy. In Italy, he opposed every government that came to office, on the grounds that there was nothing to lose, and perhaps something to gain, especially on the international scene. He fought for the restoration of the pope&#x27;s reign over the former Papal States and fought new penal codes that aimed to criminalize clerical activity. Rampolla expressed his opinion that the French people were obligated to support Prime Minister Jules Méline at the height of the Dreyfus Affair.

===1903 Conclave===

When Leo XIII died in 1903, it was widely expected that Rampolla would be elected pope. His candidacy gained momentum until the last moment when the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I imposed the veto &quot;jus exclusivae&quot; during the conclave. Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko, Archbishop of Kraków, expressed the veto on behalf of the Austrian emperor. Rampolla was reported to have received enough votes to win.

The Secretary of the Conclave, Archbishop Rafael Merry del Val, reported later that Cardinal Puzyna de Kosielsko came to see him, demanding to announce his veto against Cardinal Rampolla in the name of Franz Joseph. Merry del Val protested and refused even to accept the document. Rampolla, according to Merry del Val, actually gained votes after the veto. However, Merry del Val later told Ludwig von Pastor that he thought Rampolla was unlikely to win since a majority of the cardinals wanted a more conservative direction following the relatively liberal pontificate of Pope Leo XIII, as did he himself.

The specific reasons for Austria&#x27;s opposition to Rampolla are unclear. The veto may have been based on the pro-French positions adopted by Rampolla, which were reflected in the policies of Leo XIII. Part of the Holy See&#x27;s solution involving the French Third Republic was the attempt to reconcile French Catholics with their nation&#x27;s republican government via laïcité. This was anathema to the powerful Ultramontanes. Others claimed that Austria-Hungary was acting, for reasons unspecified, on behalf of Italy&#x27;s government through the intervention of State Minister, or that Austria-Hungary was acting on behalf of Germany.

While some prelates formally protested this intrusion after voting had been in progress, the Ultramontanist Cardinals readily recognized the existing legal right of the emperor. Support for Rampolla dissipated, leading to the election of Giuseppe Sarto as Pope Pius X. Abolition of the veto right was one of his first official acts, on 20 January 1904.

===Later years===

Pius X chose Rafael Merry del Val to succeed Rampolla as Secretary of State. Rampolla remained Arch-Priest of Saint Peter&#x27;s. Between 1908 and his death in 1913, Rampolla served as Secretary (then the head) of the Holy Office. In 1912, Pope Pius X appointed Rampolla Archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church as well, a position he held until his death. He continued to be viewed as a likely successor to Pope Pius X in case of the pontiff&#x27;s death.

Rampolla died suddenly in Rome on 16 December 1913 at age seventy, some months before the pope died in August 1914. He was buried in the Campo Verano Cemetery near the Basilica of San Lorenzo fuori le Mura. His friend and closest collaborator, Giacomo della Chiesa, who soon succeeded Pius X as Pope Benedict XV, presided over his funeral ceremonies. On 19 June 1929, twelve days after the Italian Parliament ratified the Lateran Treaty, the body of Cardinal Rampolla was transferred to Santa Cecilia in Trastevere.

<text>Carl Clinton Van Doren (September 10, 1885 – July 18, 1950) was an American critic and biographer. He was the brother of critic and teacher Mark Van Doren and the uncle of Charles Van Doren.

He won the 1939 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;.

==Life and career==
Van Doren was born on September 10, 1885, in Hope, Vermilion County, Illinois, the son of Eudora Ann (Butz) and Charles Lucius Van Doren, a country doctor. He and his younger brother Mark Van Doren (born 1894), were raised on the family farm.

Van Doren earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1907 and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1911. He continued to teach there until 1930. He was a world federalist and once said, &quot;It is obvious that no difficulty in the way of world government can match the danger of a world without it&quot;. In 1939, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;. In 1942, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Van Doren&#x27;s study &quot;The American Novel&quot;, published in 1921, is generally credited with helping to re-establish Herman Melville&#x27;s critical status as first-rate literary master. He was book section editor for &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1920 to 1922.

In 1912, Van Doren married Irita Bradford, editor of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; book review. They had three daughters together: Ann born in 1915, Margaret born in 1917, and Barbara (Bobby) born in 1920. The couple divorced in 1935. Van Doren married Jean Wright Gorman in 1939, but they divorced in 1945.

Van Doren worked closely with Howard Henry Peckham on &quot;Secret History of the American Revolution&quot; (1941), editing documents from the Sir Henry Clinton (British Army Headquarters) Papers that revealed Benedict Arnold&#x27;s treason during the American Revolutionary War.

Van Doren died in Torrington, Connecticut, on July 18, 1950.

==Legacy==
A residence hall at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign is named after Carl Clinton Van Doren.

<text>Mark Van Doren (June 13, 1894 – December 10, 1972) was an American poet, writer and critic. He was a scholar and a professor of English at Columbia University for nearly 40 years, where he inspired a generation of influential writers and thinkers including Thomas Merton, Robert Lax, John Berryman, Whittaker Chambers, and Beat Generation writers such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. He was literary editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, in New York City (1924–1928), and its film critic, 1935 to 1938.

Amongst his notable works, many published in &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot;, are a collaboration with brother Carl Van Doren, &quot;American and British Literature since 1890&quot; (1939); critical studies, &quot;The Poetry of John Dryden&quot; (1920), &quot;Shakespeare&quot; (1939), &quot;The Noble Voice&quot; (1945) and &quot;Nathaniel Hawthorne&quot; (1949); collections of poems including &quot;Jonathan Gentry&quot; (1931); stories; and the verse play &quot;The Last Days of Lincoln&quot; (1959). A notable student, later a colleague, was Lionel Trilling. David Lehman writes that &quot;Though the differences between them were many – Trilling struck some as patrician in demeanor where Van Doren seemed ever the populist – the two great professors inspired a rare filial devotion in generations of Columbia students. It was inevitably either Mark Van Doren or Lionel Trilling who was the favorite professor of students with a literary vocation, and in time Columbia would name its highest teaching accolade after Van Doren and its major award for scholarship after Trilling.&quot; He won the 1940 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for &quot;Collected Poems 1922–1938&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Van Doren was born in Hope, Illinois, the fourth of five sons of the county&#x27;s doctor, Charles Lucius Van Doren, of remote Dutch ancestry, and wife Eudora Ann Butz. He was raised on his family&#x27;s farm in eastern Illinois, before his father decided to move to the neighboring town of Urbana, to be closer to good schools.

He was the younger brother of the academic and biographer Carl Van Doren, starting with whom all five brothers attended the local elementary school and high school. Mark Van Doren eventually studied at the University of Illinois in Urbana, where he earned a B.A. in 1914. In 1920, he earned a Ph.D. from what became the Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Columbia University, while also a member of the Boar&#x27;s Head Society, a student society at the university devoted to poetry.

==Career==
Mark Van Doren joined the Columbia University faculty in 1920, having been preceded by his brother Carl. He went on to become one of Columbia&#x27;s greatest teachers and a &quot;legendary classroom presence&quot;; he became a full professor in 1942, and taught English until 1959, at which point he became Professor Emeritus until his death in 1972.

David Lehman writes that &quot;The 1920s were a great decade for Mark. At Columbia, he had remarkable students, Whittaker Chambers and Trilling among them. Van Doren published scholarly books on John Dryden and Edwin Arlington Robinson, served as literary editor of &quot;The Nation&quot; (where he met Dorothy, née Graffe, also a writer) and edited an anthology of world poetry that sold so well it enabled the Van Dorens to buy their house on Bleecker Street in the West Village in New York City in February 1929, just months before the stock market tumbled and the &#x27;roaring&#x27; decade ran out.

At a moment when Ivy League prejudice against Jews was not uncommon, Van Doren acquired a reputation for philo-Semitism with an essay he published in 1927 in the &quot;Menorah Journal&quot;, the magazine that years later would be rechristened &quot;Commentary&quot;. In &#x27;Jewish Students I Have Known,&#x27; Van Doren wrote perceptively and it turned out somewhat prophetically about some of the gifted young men he was teaching at Columbia. As Van Doren&#x27;s student, the great art historian Meyer Schapiro already displayed the &#x27;passion to know and make known.&#x27; Louis Zukofsky was &#x27;a subtle poet&#x27; with &#x27;an inarticulate soul.&#x27; Clifton Fadiman impressed with his tremendous fund of knowledge. About Trilling, who soon joined him on the Columbia faculty, Van Doren was particularly insightful. The young Trilling possessed &#x27;dignity and grace,&#x27; Van Doren wrote, and whatever he elects to do &#x27;will be lovely, for it will be the fruit of a pure intelligence slowly ripened in not too fierce a sun.&#x27;&quot; From 1953-1971 he appeared weekly opposite Maurice Samuel on NBC radio&#x27;s summer program &quot;Eternal Light: The Words We Live By&quot; where the two discussed the literary and cultural impact of the Bible.

Also among his students were the poets John Berryman and Robert Lax, novelist Anthony Robinson, psychologist Walter B. Pitkin Jr., Japanologist Donald Keene, writer and Trappist monk Thomas Merton and chemist Roald Hoffmann. Lehman writes that &quot;His teaching was grounded in the proposition that an intelligent person of good faith needed no special qualifications to read &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;The Iliad&quot;, or &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. You just needed to be attentive and use your intelligence. And because he treated the students with respect and without condescension, he brought out the best in them.&quot; He writes of his of his notable students, who &quot;ranged from ecstatic Zen Beat masters (Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac) to verse sophisticates (Louis Simpson, John Hollander, Richard Howard). It was a decisive encounter for Kerouac; he got an A in Van Doren&#x27;s Shakespeare course, and decided in consequence to quit the Columbia football team and take up literature instead.&quot;
He twice served on the staff of &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1924–1928 and again from 1935–1938. He was a member of the Society for the Prevention of World War III.

In 1940, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for &quot;Collected Poems 1922–1938&quot;. This came only a year after his elder brother Carl had won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;. Van Doren helped Ginsberg avoid jail time in June 1949 by testifying on his behalf when Ginsberg was arrested as an accessory to crimes carried out by Herbert Huncke and others, and was an important influence on Merton, both in Merton&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism and Merton&#x27;s poetry. He was a strong advocate of liberal education, and wrote the book, &quot;Liberal Education&quot; (1943), which helped promote the influential &quot;great books&quot; movement. Starting in 1941, he also did &quot;Invitation to Learning&quot;, a CBS Radio show, where as one of the experts he discussed great literature.

He was made a Fellow in American Letters of the Library of Congress and also remained president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Personal life==
In 1922 Mark Van Doren married Dorothy Graffe, novelist and writer of the memoir &quot;The Professor and I&quot; (1959), whom he had earlier met at &quot;The Nation&quot;. His successful book, &quot;Anthology of World Poetry&quot;, enabled the couple to buy a house on Bleecker Street in New York City in February 1929, before markets collapsed.

Their son, Charles Van Doren (1926-2019), briefly achieved renown as the winner of the rigged game show &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. In the film &quot;Quiz Show&quot; (1994), Mark Van Doren was played by Paul Scofield, who earned an Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category for his performance. Their second son was John Van Doren who also lived in Cornwall, Connecticut, at the farmstead where their father did most of his writing between academic years, and where he moved after retirement.

Mark Van Doren died on December 10, 1972, in Torrington, Connecticut, aged 78, two days after undergoing surgery for circulatory problems at the Charlotte Hungerford Hospital. He was interred at Cornwall Hollow Cemetery in Connecticut.

==Legacy==
His correspondence with Allen Tate is at Vanderbilt University. Since 1962, students of Columbia College have honored a great teacher at the school each year with the &quot;Mark Van Doren Award&quot;. John Updike wrote that &quot;Van Doren&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare&quot; got me through Harry Levin&#x27;s course back in 1951. Whenever I reread a Shax play, I reread what Van Doren said about it.&quot;

<doc id="753057" wikidata="Q2330647" url="?curid=753057" title="Visionary">
<text>A visionary, defined broadly, is one who can envision the future. For some groups, visioning can involve the supernatural.

Though visionaries may face accusations of hallucinating,
people may succeed in reaching a visionary state via meditation,
lucid dreams, daydreams, or art. One example of a visionary is Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th-century artist and Catholic saint. Other visionaries in religion include St Bernadette (1844-1879) and Joseph Smith (1805-1844), said to have had visions of and to have communed with the Blessed Virgin and the Angel Moroni, respectively. There is also the case of the Targum Jonathan, which was produced in antiquity and served as the targum to the Nevi&#x27;im. It described the significance of the turban or a diadem to indicate a capability on the part of Jewish priests to become agents of visionary experience.

Robert Jarvik has suggested: &quot;Leaders are visionaries with a poorly developed sense of fear and no concept of the odds against them.&quot;

== Extended meanings ==

A vision can be political, religious, environmental, social, or technological in nature. By extension, a visionary can also be a person with a clear, distinctive, and specific (in some details) vision of the future, usually connected with advances in technology or social/political arrangements. For example, Ted Nelson is referred to as a visionary in connection with the Internet.

Other visionaries simply imagine what does not yet exist but might someday, as some forms of &quot;visioning&quot; (or gazing) provide a glimpse into the possible future. Therefore, visioning can mean seeing in a utopian way what does not yet exist on earth—but might exist in another realm—such as the ideal or perfect realm as imagined or thought. Examples are Buckminster Fuller in architecture and design, Malcolm Bricklin in the automobile industry and Ada Lovelace in computing. Some people use mathematics to make visionary discoveries in the nature of the universe. In that sense, a visionary may also function as a secular prophet. Some visionaries emphasize communication, and some assume a figurehead role in organizing a social group. In other words, a visionary means that a person can see what something could be long before it actually happens.

== In business ==
The ability to get a clear picture of the future is the reason the concept is also used in the business field to denote a leader who is able to anticipate future opportunities. For instance, there is the case of the American entrepreneur Steve Jobs who is often called a visionary because he was ahead of his time, implementing new ideas that are pioneering in the technology field. Management experts do not equate this as an uncanny ability to predict the future but a capability of viewing the world differently, which allows an individual to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities. Some conceive it as the ability to form a picture of what they want of the future and make it happen.

There are authors who consider the concept of the visionary as one that is constituted by a set of acquired skills and, thus, a state that can be learned. For this reason, there are now training and educational programs that promise its learners that they can become visionary leaders. This is demonstrated by a growing body of literature that cites techniques, which can be obtained from courses in visionary thinking, for a person to reach beyond illusory boundaries.

== In art ==
Artists may produce work loosely categorized as visionary art for its content and/or for its use of artistic techniques that call for the use of extended powers of perception in the viewer: (e.g. Gustave Moreau, Samuel Palmer, Jean Delville, Ernst Fuchs, the French Symbolist Odilon Redon, Brion Gysin, Max Ernst, Stanley Spencer, Edward Burne-Jones, Adolf Wolfli, Fred Sandback, William Blake, Hieronymus Bosch, and Henry Darger).

Visionary art can be incorrectly defined as a category of primitive art (art of those not formally trained) rather than describing people who have used their visions (or dreams) to create their paintings. Salvador Dalí is one artist who would exemplify visionary art that is neither religious nor primitive.

<text>Valery Pavlovich Afanassiev (; born 8 September 1947) is a Russian pianist, writer and conductor.

== Life ==
Valery Afanassiev was born in Moscow. He studied piano at the Academic Music College and Moscow Conservatory with Emil Gilels and Yakov Zak. He was the winner of the Bach Competition in Leipzig in 1968, as well as 1st prize recipient at the Concours Reine Elisabeth in Brussels in 1971. Shortly after, while touring around Belgium, he decided to seek political asylum, and was eventually granted Belgian citizenship.

Afanassiev lives in Versailles.

== Work and critical reception ==
Afanassiev become widely known in the 1980s due to his musical partnership with Gidon Kremer. Their joint recordings of chamber works by Mozart, Schubert, and Brahms were highly praised. His interpretations of solo piano works by Franz Schubert, Ludwig van Beethoven and the others have aroused controversy on account of Afanassiev&#x27;s tempi choices and idiosyncratic expressiveness. One review of his recording of Schubert&#x27;s last three piano sonatas stated: &quot;the perversity encountered here so angered me that I felt I could not dignify what I found here with any kind of coherent analysis&quot;.

Afanassiev is also a writer of poetry, novels, and drama. He is also an orchestral conductor.

<text>Sergei Viktorovich Samsonov (; born October 27, 1978) is a Russian former professional ice hockey forward who is now a scout for the Carolina Hurricanes. He played in the NHL with six teams from 1997 to 2011. Internationally Samsonov played for the Russian national team in several tournaments, including the 2002 Winter Olympics, where he won a bronze medal.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Samsonov played in the 1992 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Moscow.

Samsonov was drafted by the Boston Bruins eighth overall in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. Boston drafted Joe Thornton first overall in the same draft. In his rookie year, Samsonov won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s best rookie after scoring 22 goals and a total of 47 points. In the 2000–01 season, he played in his only NHL All-Star Game in Denver.

Before playing in the NHL, Samsonov represented Russia in 1996 and 1997 at the World Junior Hockey Championships. He led the 1997 Russian team to a bronze medal and was named the tournament&#x27;s most outstanding forward after scoring six goals in six games. He later played for Russia in 2002 at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, earning a bronze medal.

In his early career, Samsonov was a highly touted prospect as the next future star of international hockey as he wowed fans and scouts alike with his shifty turns and scoring prowess. Samsonov scored 110 goals in 50 games with the Red Army junior team in 1994–95. That was prior to moving up to the Elite team later that season. He had 23 goals, 19 assists for a total of 42 points with 26 PIM in 64 career games with the Red Army elite team. In 1996–97, he played for the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League, and won the Garry F. Longman Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. He also won the league championship, the Turner Cup, with the Vipers. Samsonov is the only player in history to ever win the rookie of the year award for the IHL and the NHL in back-to-back seasons.

Samsonov scored his first NHL goal on October 25, 1997. It occurred in Boston&#x27;s 5-4 loss to the Florida Panthers.

On March 9, 2006, Samsonov was traded from Boston to the Edmonton Oilers for Marty Reasoner, Yan Stastny, and a second-round pick in the 2006 NHL entry draft (Milan Lucic). He was part of the Oilers team that made it to the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals.

On July 12, 2006, Samsonov signed with the Montreal Canadiens for a two-year contract worth $7.05 million. Through a lackluster season, the Canadiens placed Samsonov on waivers in February 2007, and traded him to the Chicago Blackhawks for Jassen Cullimore and Tony Salmelainen in June 2007.

On January 3, 2008, the Blackhawks assigned Samsonov to the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League (AHL) after he cleared waivers.

On January 8, 2008, the Carolina Hurricanes claimed Samsonov off re-entry waivers. He recorded his first point as a Hurricane on January 12, 2008, against the Colorado Avalanche and scored his first goal three days later in a three-point game against the Toronto Maple Leafs.

On April 16, 2008, the Hurricanes announced that they had reached an agreement with Samsonov for a three-year contract worth $7.6 million. The deal paid Samsonov $2.3 million in 2008–09, $2.5 million in 2009–10 and $2.8 million in 2010–11.

At the 2011 trade deadline, Samsonov was traded to the Florida Panthers, where he played 20 games.

In 2014 Samsonov became a scout for the Carolina Hurricanes, and in 2017 they hired him to train their forwards. In July 2023, Samsonov announced that he was leaving Carolina.

<text>Baron Brooke is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1621 and was absorbed into the Earldom of Warwick in 1759.

==History==
The title was created in 1621 for Fulke Greville, who was already 5th Baron Willoughby de Broke. Greville was a favourite courtier of Queen Elizabeth and served under her and King James I as Treasurer of the Navy and as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was also a poet and dramatist. Greville obtained from James I a grant of Warwick Castle, and in 1621 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Brooke, of Beauchamps Court in the County of Warwick, with remainder to his second cousin (once removed), and adopted son, Robert Greville. Lord Brooke never married and on his death in 1628 the barony of Willoughby de Broke was passed on to his sister Margaret.

He was succeeded in the barony of Brooke according to the special remainder by Robert Greville, who became the second Baron. He was the grandson of Robert Greville, younger son of Sir Fulke Greville (d. 1569) and Elizabeth, 3rd Baroness Willoughby de Broke. He was a prominent Parliamentarian commander in the Civil War. Lord Brooke was killed during the siege of Lichfield Cathedral in 1643. 
His younger son, the fourth Baron, was one of the six commissioners deputed to invite the return of Charles II in 1660 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire. He outlived all of his six sons and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Baron. 
He represented Warwick in the House of Commons.
His grandson and successor, the sixth Baron, died from fever at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Baron.
His third but eldest surviving son, the eighth Baron, was Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. In 1746 he was created Earl Brooke, of Warwick Castle, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The earldom of Warwick created in 1618 for a member of the Rich family became extinct in September 1759, and in November of the same year Lord Brooke was created Earl of Warwick in the Peerage of Great Britain.

From this point the history of the barony was tied to the history of the Earldom of Warwick.

<text>Amateur geology or rock collecting (also referred to as rockhounding in the United States and Canada) is the non-professional study and hobby of collecting rocks and minerals or fossil specimens from the natural environment. In Australia, New Zealand and Cornwall, the amateur geologists call this activity fossicking. The first amateur geologists were prospectors looking for valuable minerals and gemstones for commercial purposes. Eventually, however, more people have been drawn to amateur geology for recreational purposes, mainly for the beauty that rocks and minerals provide.

==Accessibility==
One reason for the rise in popularity of amateur geology is that a collection can begin by simply picking up a rock. There are people who have formed clubs and groups that search for specimens and compare them with collections from other groups as a hobby. Information on such groups can be found at libraries, bookstores, and &quot;gem and mineral shows&quot;. Tourist information centers and small-town chambers of commerce supply valuable local information. The Internet can also be a useful search tool as it can help find other amateur geologists.

==Tools==

The amateur geologist&#x27;s principal piece of equipment is the geologist&#x27;s hammer. This is a small tool with a pick-like point on one end, and a flat hammer on the other. The hammer end is for breaking rocks, and the pick end is mainly used for prying and digging into crevices. The pick end of most rock hammers can dull quickly if struck onto bare rock. Rock collectors also use a sledgehammer to break hard rocks. Collectors usually search for rocks in quarries, road cuts, rocky hills, mountains, and streams.

==Legality==
There are many different laws in place regarding the collection of rocks and minerals from public areas, so it is advisable to read up on local laws before prospecting. Rock and mineral collecting is prohibited in most, if not all national parks in the United States.

==Resources==
Since October 2000, mindat.org has been an important resource for mineral related fields. Its original purpose was to share information about minerals, their properties and where they are found. Today, it is the world&#x27;s largest public database of mineral information supported worldwide by volunteers adding and verifying new information daily.

==Related fields==
Avid rock collectors often use their specimens to learn about gemstones, petrology, mineralogy and geology as well as skills in the identification and classifying of specimen rocks, and preparing them for display. The hobby can lead naturally into lapidary projects, and also the cutting, polishing, and mounting of gemstones and minerals. The equipment needed to do this includes rock saws and polishers. Many beautiful crystal varieties are typically found in very small samples which requires a good microscope for working with and photographing the specimen. The hobby can be as simple as finding pretty rocks for a windowsill or develop into a detailed and comprehensive museum quality display.

==Notable Rockhounds and mineral collectors==
*Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1748–1832) was a German author who was a skilled amateur scientist with a great interest in minerals. The iron mineral goethite is named after him. 

*James Smithson (1765–1829) is well known as the benefactor of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. The Smithsonian now houses the finest collection of minerals and gems in the world. 

*John Ruskin (1819–1900) was an Englishman, essayist and art critic who gained an interest early in his life for minerals. He authored a small volume of ten lectures on mineralogy titled &quot;Ethics of the Dust&quot;. He gave numerous specimens to the British Natural History Museum including the well known Edwardes Ruby and yellow Colenso diamond. This octahedral diamond was a total of 133 carats and was on display at the museum for 70 years. In 1965 the diamond was stolen and to this day has never been recovered. 

*George Frederick Kunz (1856–1932) assembled numerous important mineral collections throughout his life, such as a research collection for Thomas Edison. He also assembled the Morgan-Tiffany collection of gems which went to the American Museum of Natural History. He was mostly self-taught in regards to mineralogy and gemology, but his skills and knowledge landed him a position as a gem expert with Tiffany &amp; Company at the age of 23. In 1903 the newly discovered violet pink variety of spodumene was named kunzite in his honor after his death.

*John Sinkankas (1915–2002) was a gemologist, lapidary enthusiast, micromounter and author. He was a fellow of the Mineralogical Society of America. In 1982, he was awarded the &quot;Distinguished Associate Award&quot; from the Gemological Institute of America.

<doc id="753082" wikidata="Q380235" url="?curid=753082" title="Hermann Bondi">
<text>Sir Hermann Bondi (1 November 1919 – 10 September 2005) was an Austrian-British mathematician and cosmologist.

He is best known for developing the steady state model of the universe with Fred Hoyle and Thomas Gold as an alternative to the Big Bang theory. He contributed to the theory of general relativity,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1023/A:1026726520289&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first to analyze the inertial and gravitational interaction of negative mass and the first to explicate correctly the nature of gravitational waves. In his 1990 autobiography, Bondi regarded the 1962 work on gravitational waves as his &quot;best scientific work&quot;.

== Early life ==
Bondi was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish medical doctor. He was brought up in Vienna, where he studied at the Realgymnasium. He showed early prodigious ability at mathematics, and was recommended to Arthur Eddington by Abraham Fraenkel. Fraenkel was a distant relation, the only mathematician in the extended family and Hermann&#x27;s mother had the foresight to arrange a meeting between her young son and the famous man knowing that this might be the key to enabling him to follow his wishes and become a mathematician himself. Eddington encouraged him to travel to England to read the mathematical tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge. He arrived in Cambridge in 1937, escaping from antisemitism in Austria. Realizing the perilous position of his parents in 1938, shortly before the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, he sent them a telegram telling them to leave Austria at once. They managed to reach Switzerland and subsequently settled in New York.

In the early years of World War II, he was interned on the Isle of Man and in Canada as a friendly enemy alien. Other internees included Thomas Gold and Max Perutz. In 1940, Bondi became Senior Wrangler at the University of Cambridge. Bondi and Gold were released from internment by the end of 1941, and worked with Fred Hoyle on radar at the Admiralty Signals Establishment. He became a British subject in 1946.

== Career ==
Bondi lectured in mathematics in the University of Cambridge from 1945 to 1954. He was a fellow of Trinity College from 1943 to 1949 and from 1952 to 1954.

In 1948, Hermann Bondi, Fred Hoyle and Thomas Gold formulated the Steady State theory, which holds that the universe is constantly expanding but matter is constantly created to form new stars and galaxies to maintain a constant average density. Steady State theory was eclipsed by the rival Big Bang theory with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

Bondi was one of the first to correctly appreciate the nature of gravitational radiation, introducing Bondi radiation coordinates, the Bondi k-calculus, the notions of Bondi mass and Bondi news, and writing review articles. He popularized the sticky bead argument which was said to be originally due, anonymously, to Richard Feynman, for the claim that physically meaningful gravitational radiation is indeed predicted by general relativity, an assertion which was controversial up until about 1955. A 1947 paper revived interest in the Lemaître–Tolman metric, an inhomogeneous, spherically symmetric dust solution (often called the LTB or Lemaître–Tolman–Bondi metric). Bondi also contributed to the theory of accretion of matter from a cloud of gas onto a star or a black hole, working with Raymond Lyttleton and giving his name to &quot;Bondi accretion&quot; and the &quot;Bondi radius&quot;.

He became a professor in King&#x27;s College London in 1954 and was appointed Emeritus Professor 
there in 1985. He was secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1956 to 1964.

== Other work ==

Bondi was also active outside the confines of academic lecturing and research. He held many positions:
*Director-General of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) (1967–1971) (which later became the European Space Agency, ESA)
*Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence (1971–1977)
*Chief Scientific Adviser to the Department of Energy (1977–1980)
*Chairman of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (1980–1984)
*President of the Society for Research into Higher Education (1981–1997)
*President of the Hydrographic Society (1985–1987)
*Master of Churchill College, Cambridge (1983–1990).

He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1959. He made a series of television programs called &quot;E=mc2&quot; for the BBC in 1963. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1973. He was awarded the Einstein Society Gold Medal in 1983, the Gold Medal of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in 1988, the G.D. Birla International Award for Humanism, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 2001. He was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) by the University of Bath in 1974.

His report into the flooding of London in 1953 led eventually to the building of the Thames Barrier. He also supported the proposal for a Severn Barrage to generate electricity, but this project was not carried forward.

His papers from 1940 to 2000 are archived in 109 archive boxes by the Janus Project.

== Personal life ==
His parents were Jewish, but he never &quot;felt the need for religion&quot; and was a lifelong humanist. He was president of the British Humanist Association from 1982 to 1999, and president of the Rationalist Press Association from 1982. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

He married Christine Stockman, also a mathematician and astronomer, in 1947; she had been one of Hoyle&#x27;s research students and like him she went on to be active in the humanist movement. Together, they had two sons and three daughters, one of whom is Professor Liz Bondi, feminist geographer at the University of Edinburgh. He died at Cambridge in 2005, aged 85 and his ashes were scattered at Anglesey Abbey near Cambridge. Christine died in 2015.

<text>Kenilworth Road, known affectionately as The Kenny, is an association football stadium in Bury Park, Luton, Bedfordshire, England. It has been the home ground of Luton Town since 1905. The stadium has also hosted women&#x27;s and youth international matches, including the second leg of the 1984 European Competition for Women&#x27;s Football final.

The 12,000 all-seater stadium is situated in the district of Bury Park, one mile (1.6 km) west of the centre of Luton. It is named after the road which runs along one end of it, though its official address is 1 Maple Road. Kenilworth Road hosted football in the Southern League until 1920, then in the Football League until 2009, when Luton were relegated to the Conference Premier. It has hosted Football League matches once more since 2014. With Luton Town&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League in 2023, the first Premier League game at Kenilworth Road was against West Ham United in September 2023.

Floodlights were fitted in 1953, and the ground became all-seated in 1991. The record attendance of 30,069 was set in 1959, in an FA Cup sixth round replay against Blackpool. The ground is known for the unusual entrance to the Oak Road End, and the five-season ban on away supporters that Luton Town imposed following a riot by visiting fans in 1985.

==History==
Luton Town moved to Kenilworth Road in 1905, leaving their previous home at Dunstable Road after their landlord sold the site for housing at short notice. The club&#x27;s directors quickly procured a new site, and the club&#x27;s first match at the new ground came on 4 September 1905—a 0–0 draw against Plymouth Argyle. Watford player C. Barnes scored the first ever goal at the stadium, in a reserve match. Originally known as Ivy Road, the new ground brought success with it—in their last season at Dunstable Road, Luton had finished second from bottom, but in the first at Kenilworth Road, Luton finished fourth in the Southern League.
The ground has undergone several major changes since its original construction in 1905. The original Main Stand, boasting a press loft and a balcony above the roof, burnt down in 1921, and was replaced by the current stand before the 1922–23 campaign. The new Main Stand was split into two: the upper tier contained wooden seats, so there was a ban on smoking in the stand; the lower tier, which became known as the Enclosure, was terracing.

When attendances were first counted, in 1932–33, Luton Town&#x27;s average home attendance was taken at 5,868. Kenilworth Road&#x27;s capacity of the time was 25,000, so it was not deemed necessary to improve the ground. However, only three years later, on 25 April 1936, a match against Coventry City attracted 23,142 spectators—at that time a club record. The decision was taken to renovate the stadium, already in disrepair, and work began at the end of the following season. The Kenilworth End terrace was extended, the Oak Road End received a roof and major work was done on the Main Stand. Following these steps, the ground was more in line with those of rival clubs, the capacity standing at 30,000.
The first ten years following Kenilworth Road&#x27;s renovation saw average attendances of between 15,000 and 18,000; a huge improvement on what the club had previously been able to attract. Floodlights were installed at the ground before the 1953–54 season, and used for the first time in a friendly against Turkish side Fenerbahçe on 7 October 1953. The Oak Road terrace was extended in 1955, and promotion to the First Division for 1955–56 saw the average attendance climb as high as 21,454.

Renovation of Kenilworth Road was neglected for the next two decades—financial difficulties and the club&#x27;s ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, while the rest of the ground remained terracing. The new look stand could hold only 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.

A £1 million refurbishment got underway in 1985 with the introduction of an artificial turf playing surface, as well as the conversion of the ground to become all-seated, which began a year later in 1986. The Oak Road End terrace was filled with seats, while the Bobbers Stand had its seats ripped out to be replaced with executive boxes. The Main Stand&#x27;s terraced enclosure received seats, and work also began on converting the Kenilworth Stand, which had a roof added to it at this time and would also receive seats in stages over the coming years.

The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991, simply called the New Stand on construction. The most recent improvements to the ground came in 2005, when the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand was finally completed to bring the capacity to 10,356.

On 24 March 2015 the ground was officially renamed &quot;The Prostate Cancer UK Stadium&quot; for one day, for the game against Wycombe Wanderers, in support of charity and raising awareness of prostate cancer.

===Artificial pitch===
In 1985, following the lead of Queen Park Rangers&#x27; experiment at Loftus Road four years earlier, the grass pitch was dug up and replaced with an artificial playing surface. The surface, called Sporturf Professional, was manufactured by En-Tout-Cas, and cost the club £350,000. The first match on the new pitch resulted in a 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest. The new surface quickly became unpopular with both players and fans, and was derided as &quot;the plastic pitch&quot;. Protests about the quality of the pitch from other teams resulted in a meeting with a number of major clubs in 1989, mediated by a Football League Commission. The Commission concluded that the pitch had suffered excessive wear and tear from too much use, and Luton installed a replacement artificial surface, at a cost of £60,000, during the summer of 1989. The second artificial pitch was itself removed during the summer of 1991, following the banning of such surfaces by The Football League, and the club returned to a natural grass surface.

===Away fan ban===
On 13 March 1985, Millwall visited Kenilworth Road for an FA Cup sixth round match. After only 14 minutes the match was halted as the visiting fans began to riot. The referee took both teams off for 25 minutes, before bringing them back on to complete the match. Following the final whistle, and a 1–0 victory for Luton, another pitch invasion and subsequent riot by away supporters caused noticeable damage to the ground and the surrounding area. Many of those arrested turned out to be supporters of teams other than Millwall. The club&#x27;s chairman, David Evans, reacted by imposing a ban on all away supporters from Kenilworth Road from the start of the 1986–87 season as well as introducing a scheme that would require even home supporters to carry membership cards to be admitted to matches. The Football League insisted that Luton relax the ban for League Cup matches, but when Evans refused to allow Cardiff City fans to visit Kenilworth Road for their second round tie, the club were thrown out of the competition. The ban continued for four seasons, with exceptions for cup matches, before Luton Town repealed the ban before the 1990–91 season.

===Ownership===
The ground was first constructed in 1905, soon before the club moved in. The club rented the ground until 1933, when newly appointed chairman Charles Jeyes organised the purchase of the stadium. The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989, when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £3.25 million. The club was granted a seven-year lease at peppercorn rent for its continued use. This arrangement has been extended several times, and as of 2015 is due to end in 2028.

==Structure and facilities==
The ground is made up of five stands—opposite the eponymous Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, and to the left is the Main Stand, which is flanked to its right by the David Preece Stand. Opposite them stand a row of executive boxes.

The Main Stand covers approximately two-thirds of the length of the pitch, though the attached enclosure is longer, covering the whole distance. The Main Stand, which seats 4,277 fans, also contains the dressing rooms, club offices and television gantry, as well as a number of supporting pillars, a car park and the Nick Owen and Eric Morecambe suites. To the Main Stand&#x27;s right, in the corner above the end of the enclosure and next to the Kenilworth Stand, is the David Preece Stand, a family area which seats 711 spectators. The David Preece Stand acquired its present name in 2008, a year after the former player&#x27;s death.

Opposite the Main and Preece Stands are 25 executive boxes, which have an attached net to catch balls directed over them and a total capacity of 209. The Bobbers Stand stood here until 1986, when the seats were removed from the stand and replaced with the boxes.

To the right of the Main Stand is the 3,229-seater Kenilworth Stand, which backs onto Kenilworth Road. The Club Shop is behind this stand, which was once an open terrace but is now a roofed all-seater stand. In the corner between the Kenilworth Stand and the boxes is the stadium clock.

Opposite the Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which bears an electronic scoreboard on its roof and can seat a maximum of 1,800 fans. Originally a home section, the Oak Road End was turned into a stand for away fans only at the start of the 1991–92 season. Early in the 2013–14 season, the Oak Road End was re-opened for home supporters for fixtures where visiting support was predicted to be especially low, with the section for away fans moved to A Block of the Kenilworth Stand for these games. Later that season, it was announced that the stand was available for shared use between both home and away supporters, increasing Kenilworth Road&#x27;s home capacity by 15%. The Oak Road End has an entrance that is often considered unusual, requiring spectators to go through an entrance built into the row of houses and up stairs to the stand.
==Moving and redevelopment plans==

Luton Town have been looking for a new ground since 1955, when club chairman Percy Mitchell spoke of building a stadium &quot;to hold 35,000 in comfort ... [and] get a lot of support which goes to London at the moment&quot;. However, due to unstable finances and an inability to find a site, no ground was built. The club proposed a move to Milton Keynes in 1982—according to &quot;The Luton News&quot;, to play as &quot;MK Hatters&quot; in an indoor &quot;super-stadium&quot;—and this was approved by the Football League in 1983 but was prevented by vehement protests in Luton, where supporters against such a move marched through the town to display their feelings. Despite consistent fan opposition to the idea, relocation up the M1 motorway to the new town was raised several more times over the next two decades; for example, the Football League later refused Luton permission to move to Milton Keynes in 2000, saying that a member club was not allowed to leave its home town. Wimbledon F.C. was granted permission to relocate there in 2002, did so a year later and became Milton Keynes Dons in 2004.

The first time Luton managed to get as far as a planning application for a new ground was when chairman David Kohler&#x27;s Kohlerdome was proposed in 1995. The Kohlerdome was envisioned by Kohler as a 20,000 all-seater indoor arena with a retractable roof and pitch, hosting 85 capacity events each year. Kohler&#x27;s plans, though ambitious, were perhaps not very realistic—the plans were turned down by the Secretary of State in 1998, with the reason given that the ground was not feasible unless the M1 motorway was widened. Kohler put the club on the market upon the plan&#x27;s rejection and after a period under Cliff Bassett, the club came under the control of Mike Watson-Challis in 2000. Watson-Challis bought of land by Junction 10 of the M1 in 2001, intending to move the club there, but once again, nothing came of the scheme. In 2007, Jayten Stadium Limited were hoping to relocate the club to a new purpose built stadium at Junction 12, near Harlington and Toddington. This plan was very unpopular with both Luton Town supporters and the local authorities, but a planning application was still submitted by former chairman Bassett on the club&#x27;s behalf. The application was withdrawn by the club almost immediately after the takeover by Nick Owen&#x27;s Luton Town Football Club 2020 consortium in 2008.

By 2012, the club was undertaking an independent feasibility study to determine a viable location to move to. Sites mooted included a ground built as part of a new housing development to the west of Luton and a site by the proposed Junction 11A of the M1, which is the preferred site of the local authorities. Luton Town did not rule out staying at a redeveloped Kenilworth Road, entering talks to buy the stadium back from the council in October 2012, but by mid-2015 these plans had been dropped in favour of a move to a new location. Managing director Gary Sweet confirmed that the club was in a position to &quot;buy land, secure the best possible professional advice ... and to see the [planning] application process through to the receipt of consent.&quot; The club announced its new preferred location in 2015—Power Court in central Luton, near the Mall and St Mary&#x27;s Church, for a 17,500-seater stadium.

Planning permission for this ground, with potential to expand to 23,000 seats, was granted by Luton Borough Council on 16 January 2019.

===2023-2024 redevelopment===

Following the club’s promotion, for the first time to the Premier League in May 2023, they embarked on a £10m work programme to construct a new stand to meet broadcast and media requirements in readiness for the 2023–24 season. On 14 July, the club announced that there was uncertainty that this would be completed in time for their planned first home fixture of the season, against Burnley on 19 August and consequently this match was postponed. On 25 July, Luton Borough Council agreed to pay £400,000 towards upgrading CCTV, construction and widening of steps at Beech End road near the Bobbers Stand. Following redevelopment of the Bobbers Stand, the club announced that their EFL Cup game against Gillingham on 29 August 2023 would be a test event to ensure safety compliance for the stand before their first Premier League game, against West Ham United on 1 September. The stand would operate at 75% capacity with tickets distributed for free to displaced hospitality guests. The first full operation of the stand, for a Premier League game was on 1 September as Luton lost 2–1 to West Ham.

On 1 March 2024, work was completed on the installation of safe standing in the Oak Road stand which increased the stadium&#x27;s capacity by 800. The club plans to install additional safe standing in the Enclosure.

==Other uses==
Kenilworth Road has been used occasionally by the England women&#x27;s team. The inaugural UEFA Women&#x27;s Championship in 1984 saw Kenilworth Road play host to the second leg of the Final against Sweden, won by Sweden on penalties. The most recent use of the stadium by the women&#x27;s team was a 4–2 victory over Spain on 22 March 2001. Kenilworth Road has been used by England&#x27;s under-17 team since the 1970s, most recently in a 3–0 win over their Italian counterparts in the 2007 FA International Tournament Final.

The ground is home to the Hatters Study Support Centre, which provides local school pupils with ICT equipment, football training and lessons in numeracy and literacy. Kenilworth Road also hosts a number of local tournaments and events, including an annual youth competition organised by London Luton Airport.

On 23 March 2024 Hashtag United women beat Newcastle United women at Kenilworth Road in the FA Women&#x27;s National League Cup

==Records==

The highest attendance record at this stadium was 30,069 against Blackpool in the FA Cup on 4 March 1959. The highest attendance in the Football League was 27,911 against Wolverhampton Wanderers in Division One on 5 November 1955.

The highest seasonal average for Luton at Kenilworth Road was 21,455 in the 1955–56 season. Luton&#x27;s lowest seasonal average was 5,527 in 1998–99. The most recent season in which the average attendance was more than 10,000 was in the 2023-24 season, when the seasonal average was 11,278.

==Transport==
The ground is located about half a mile away from Luton railway station, which lies on the Midland Main Line. Thameslink operate trains north to Bedford and south via London St Pancras to Brighton. East Midlands Railway operate trains north to Nottingham and Sheffield, and south to London St Pancras. Many of the roads near the ground are for residential permit holders only, meaning car parking at the ground is notoriously difficult. The number 31 bus, which is operated by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex and runs every ten minutes from outside the railway station, stops at the junction of Oak Road and Dunstable Road. The Luton to Dunstable Busway includes a terminal behind the Main Stand on Clifton Road as part of the A, B, C and E routes running between Luton Airport and Houghton Regis.

<text>John William Van Druten (1 June 190119 December 1957) was an English playwright and theatre director. He began his career in London, and later moved to America, becoming a U.S. citizen. He was known for his plays of witty and urbane observations of contemporary life and society.

==Biography==
Van Druten was born in London in 1901, son of a Dutch father named Wilhelmus van Druten and his English wife Eva. He was educated at University College School and read law at the University of London. Before commencing his career as a writer, he practised law for a while as a solicitor and university lecturer in Wales.
He first came to prominence with &quot;Young Woodley&quot;, a slight but charming study of adolescence, produced in New York in 1925. However, it was banned in London by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s office owing to its then-controversial portrayal of a schoolboy falling in love with his headmaster&#x27;s wife. In Britain, it was first produced privately (by Phyllis Whitworth&#x27;s Three Hundred Club) and then at the Arts Theatre in 1928. When the ban was lifted, it had a successful run at the Savoy Theatre in the West End with a cast including Frank Lawton, Derrick De Marney, and Jack Hawkins. The play was filmed twice. It was revived at the Finborough Theatre, London, in 2006.

Van Druten was one of the more successful playwrights of the early 1930s in London, with star-studded West End productions of his work, including &quot;Diversion&quot; (1927), &quot;After All&quot; (1929), &quot;London Wall&quot; (1931) with Frank Lawton and John Mills, &quot;There&#x27;s Always Juliet&quot; (1931), &quot;Somebody Knows&quot; (1932), &quot;Behold, We Live&quot; (1932) with Gertrude Lawrence and Gerald du Maurier, &quot;The Distaff Side&quot; (1933), and &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; (1934).

He later emigrated to America, where he wrote &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (February 1940), a drama set in London and Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex, which was shortly followed by major successes with &quot;Old Acquaintance&quot; (NY December 1940 – May 1941 and London with Edith Evans) and &quot;The Voice of the Turtle&quot; (1943), which ran for three seasons in New York and was filmed with Ronald Reagan. His subsequent play, &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1944), ran for 713 performances. It was later made into a movie and a television series. In 1944, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. His play &quot;Make Way for Lucia&quot; (1948), based on the Mapp and Lucia novels of E. F. Benson, was premiered in New York, but did not have its first professional British production until 1995.

His 1951 play &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;, together with Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s short stories, &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; (1939), formed the basis of Joe Masteroff&#x27;s book for the Kander and Ebb musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966). When &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; opened on Broadway in 1951, &quot;The New York Times&quot; drama critic Walter Kerr wrote a famous three-word review: &quot;Me no Leica.&quot;

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, he was in a relationship with Carter Lodge (died 1995), who was the manager of the AJC Ranch that Van Druten, British actress Auriol Lee and Lodge bought together in Coachella Valley. When the relationship ended, Lodge continued to live on the ranch with his new partner, Dick Foote. When Van Druten died in 1957, he left the entire property of the ranch to Lodge and the rights in his work, including &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;, which entitled Lodge to earn a percentage from the movie &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972).

He died at Indio, California on 19 December 1957 of undisclosed causes. He is buried in the Coachella Valley Public Cemetery.

== Association with Vedanta ==

John Van Druten&#x27;s friend and colleague, Christopher Isherwood had fled Europe just before WWII broke out. Isherwood settled in the Los Angeles area and began a life-long association with his guru, Swami Prabhavananda. It was Isherwood who wrote &quot;The Berlin Stories&quot;, on which Van Druten based his play, &quot;I Am A Camera&quot;. Through Isherwood Van Druten became involved with the Vedanta Society of Southern California in Hollywood, which was founded in 1930 by Swami Prabhavananda. 

From 1951 until his death in 1957, Van Druten was an Editorial Advisor, along with Gerald Heard, Aldous Huxley, and Christopher Isherwood, for the bi-monthly journal &quot;Vedanta and the West&quot;, published by the Vedanta Society of Southern California. During that time, the journal published 10 essays by Van Druten.

<doc id="753099" wikidata="Q4050618" url="?curid=753099" title="TSX-Plus">
<text>TSX-Plus is a multi-user operating system for the PDP-11/LSI-11 series of computers. It was developed by S&amp;H Computer Systems, Inc. and is based on DEC&#x27;s RT-11 single-user real-time operating system (TSX-Plus installs on top of RT-11).

==Overview==
The system is highly configurable and tunable.

Due to the constraints of the memory management system in the PDP-11/LSI-11, the entire operating system core must occupy no more than 40 kibibytes of memory, out of a maximum possible 4 mebibytes of physical memory that can actually be installed in those machines (mandated by the 22-bit address space). The strength of TSX-Plus is to simultaneously provide to multiple users the services of DEC&#x27;s single-user RT-11. Depending on which PDP-11 model and the amount of memory, the system could support a minimum of 12 users (14-18 users on a 2Mb 11/73, depending on workload). A productivity feature called &quot;virtual lines&quot; &quot;allows a single user to control several tasks from a single terminal.&quot;

The software included a WP package named Lex-11 and a spreadsheet from Saturn Software. The machine slowed considerably if more than 8 students wanted to use the word-processing package at the same time. There was also a decision-table language called &quot;D&quot; from the NCC in Manchester which worked very well on TSX Plus.

==History==
Released in 1980, TSX-Plus was the successor to TSX, released in 1976. The system was popular in the 1980s. The last version of TSX-Plus had TCP/IP support.

S&amp;H wrote the original TSX because &quot;Spending $25K on a computer that could only support one user bugged&quot; (founder Harry Sanders); the outcome was the initial four-user TSX in 1976.

==Bootstrapping==

TSX-Plus required bootstrapping RT-11 first before running TSX-Plus as a user program. Once TSX-Plus was running, it would take over complete control of the machine from RT-11. It provided true memory protection for users from other users, provided user accounts and maintained account separation on disk volumes and implemented a superset of the RT-11 EMT programmed requests. RT-11 programs generally ran, unmodified, under TSX-Plus and, in fact, most of the RT-11 utilities were used as-is under TSX-Plus. Device drivers generally required only slight modifications.

<doc id="753103" wikidata="Q1340186" url="?curid=753103" title="Chicago Police Department">
<text>The Chicago Police Department (CPD) is the primary law enforcement agency of the city of Chicago, Illinois, United States, under the jurisdiction of the Chicago City Council. It is the second-largest municipal police department in the United States, behind the New York City Police Department. As of 2023 CPD had 11,703 sworn officers on duty, and in 2020 had more than 948 other employees. Tracing its roots to 1835, the Chicago Police Department is one of the oldest modern police departments in the world. 

The Chicago Police Department has both a past &amp; recent-present history of police brutality, racial profiling, misconduct and corruption, and at one point, tortured multiple people in custody in the 1980s. In 2017, the United States Department of Justice criticized the department for poor training, lack of oversight, and repeated incidents of excessive force.

==Department structure==

===Office of the Superintendent===
The Superintendent of Police leads the Chicago Police Department. 

In 1960, the municipal government created a five-member police board charged with nominating a superintendent to be the chief authority over police officers, drafting and adopting rules and regulations governing the police system, submitting budget requests to the city council, and hearing and deciding disciplinary cases involving police officers. Criminologist O. W. Wilson was brought on as Superintendent of Police, and served until 1967 when he retired. This position, in its current iteration, has existed as the head of the Chicago Police Department since 1960.

===Salary===
Starting salary for Chicago police officers in 2024 is $58,842, which is increased to $83,970 after 18 months. Promotions to specialized or command positions also increase an officer&#x27;s base pay. Salaries were supplemented with a $2,920 annual duty availability and an $1,800 annual uniform allowance.

=== Demographics ===
In 2017, the composition of the department&#x27;s sworn personnel by gender was 77% male and 23% female. The highest ranked woman in Chicago police history was Barbara West, who was appointed to the department&#x27;s third-highest rank (the deputy superintendent) in 2020.

In 2017, the racial composition of the department&#x27;s sworn personnel was:
* 50% non-Hispanic White
* 25% Hispanic (of any race)
* 21% African American
* 3% Asian American/Pacific Islander
* 1% other

=== Union ===
The Chicago Police Department became unionized at the end of 1980. Chicago police officers are represented by the Fraternal Order of Police. In 2020, Officer John Catanzara was elected as the head of the union. Cataranza has one of the worst disciplinary records in the department. Previously in 2017, Cataranza stated of Muslims: &quot;Savages they all deserve a bullet.&quot; Later, he defended the January 6 United States Capitol attack, saying, &quot;They&#x27;re individuals ... They get to do what they want.&quot;

== Oversight ==

Five government agencies are charged with various aspects of police oversight in Chicago: a set of 22 Police District Councils, the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability, the Chicago Police Board, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, and the Deputy Inspector General for Public Safety. Most of these bodies were created by ordinances passed in 2016 and 2021, and their membership is determined through a mix of appointments by the Mayor of Chicago, confirmations by the Chicago City Council, and elections.

==History==
According to historian Sam Mitrani, the Chicago Police Department professionalized and grew in size during the 19th century in order to quell labor unrest. City policymakers cooperated with business elites in terms of structuring the police department. The Chicago Police Department remained beset by vast corruption well into the 20th century.

===19th century===


In 1825, prior to the creation of Cook County, in what would later become, the village of Chicago, was in Putnam County. Archibald Clybourn was appointed to be Constable of the area between the DuPage River and Lake Michigan. Clybourn went on to become an important citizen of the city, and the diagonal Clybourn Avenue is named after him.

Chicago was given authorization to establish a police force on January 31, 1835, and it was formally established on August 15, with Orsemus Morrison as its first constable. The Municipal Court of Chicago was created in 1837. The title of the leader of the department, Head Constable, was changed to City Marshall in 1841, with Orson Smith being the first to hold it.

Cyrus P. Bradley, who was appointed chief of police on May 26, 1855, reorganized the department in 1855, with the day and night watches being combined and its size increasing by sixfold. Chicago was divided into three police divisions and districts. Uniforms were instituted in 1858, as prior to this officers wore plain clothes. In 1855, the newly elected city council passed ordinances to formally establish the Chicago Police Department. Chicago was divided into three police precincts, each served by a station house. Station No. 1 was located in a building on State Street between Lake and Randolph streets. Station No. 2 was on West Randolph Street near Des Plaines Street. Station No. 3 was on Michigan Street (since then renamed Hubbard Street) near Clark Street. Political connections were important to joining the force; formal requirements were few, until 1895. After 1856, the department hired many foreign-born recruits, especially unskilled, but English-speaking, Irish immigrants.

There were 67 total police officers in 1860, compared to the over 100,000 inhabitants of Chicago. In 1860, the detective forces were established. In 1861, the state legislature create the Chicago Police Commission, which was abolished in 1875. Mayor John Wentworth, an opponent of the state&#x27;s control over the police, fired the city&#x27;s entire police force on March 27, 1861. Most of these men were rehired by the police board within a few hours.

James L. Shelton became the department&#x27;s first black officer in 1871. In 1875, the Illinois General Assembly found that the police commissioners were unable to control rampant corruption within the Chicago Police Department. The legislature passed a new law returning power over the police to the mayor. The mayor was allowed to appoint a single police commissioner with the advice and consent of the city council.

In 1896, a parade of Chicago police officers was the subject of the first film ever to be shot in Chicago.

Women entered the force in 1885, as matrons, caring for female prisoners. Marie Owens is believed to have been the first female police officer in the U.S., joining the Chicago Police Department in 1891, retiring in 1923. Holding the rank of Sergeant, Owens enforced child labor and welfare laws.

Despite centralized policies and practices, the captains who ran the precincts or districts were relatively independent of headquarters, owing their jobs to neighborhood politicians. Decentralization meant that police could respond to local concerns, but graft often determined which concerns got the most attention. In 1895, Chicago adopted civil service procedures, and written tests became the basis for hiring and promotion. Standards for recruits rose, though policing remained political.

===20th century===

In 1906, the Department&#x27;s Mounted Patrol was created to provide crowd control, and in 1908, the force was granted its first three motor cars, expanding in 1910 to motorbikes and boats. Female officers were formally appointed beginning on August 13, 1913, starting with ten officers that included Alice Clement. In 1918, Grace Wilson, possibly the first black female police officer in United States history, joined the force. In 1913, Clement became the first female police detective for the Chicago Police Department.

In 1917, the Chicago Police Reserves were formed, organized on a regimental basis. They were used to assist or replace regular officers in high-crowd events, such as Memorial Day, and during the 1918 flu pandemic, worked for two weeks to enforce stringent health regulations.

The Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre led to the creation of the United States&#x27; first crime laboratory at Northwestern University, purchased by the Department in 1938.

Orlando W. Wilson, the first civilian superintendent, was appointed by the mayor in 1960. A former dean of criminology, Wilson introduced major reforms to the Department, including a new and innovative communications center, the reduction of police stations, a fairer promotion process, and an emphasis on motorized patrol over foot patrol. Vehicles were painted blue and white and given blue lightbars, introducing the familiar Sillitoe tartan headbands, and the official motto, &#x27;We Serve And Protect&#x27;. In 1963, the Cadet Program was also introduced.

The 1968 Democratic National Convention in Grant Park led to major criticism of the Chicago Police&#x27;s crowd control methods, with the Walker Report criticizing both the Department and the National Guard for use of excessive force, and called the events a police riot.

The Department&#x27;s Mounted Patrol was disbanded in 1948. The Department&#x27;s Mounted Patrol was re-established in 1974, renamed simply as the Mounted Unit.

In April 1977, the CPD adopted a flag.

In August 1983, the Chicago Police Department&#x27;s first black superintendent, Fred Rice Jr., was appointed by Mayor Harold Washington, the city&#x27;s first black mayor. The first Hispanic superintendent, Matt L. Rodriguez, was appointed by Mayor Richard M. Daley in 1992.

===21st century===
The new Chicago Police Department Headquarters was opened on June 3, 2000, replacing an extremely aged and outdated building located at 1121 South State Street.

In 2018, the Chicago PD began a “narcotics arrest diversion program” to help individuals without violent crime records who are habitual narcotic users. Working with Chicago-based Thresholds, an addiction recovery agency, the police give those suffering from substance abuse disorder one final chance: If they enter the program, charges against them are dropped. In 2020, three African Americans, David Brown, Eric Carter and Barbara West, were appointed to the Chicago PD&#x27;s three highest ranking positions, marking the first time in history that the department&#x27;s Superintendent, 1st Deputy Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent were African American.

In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the largest union for the CPD compared vaccine requirements for police to the Holocaust. The union head encouraged CPD officers not to get vaccinated.

In August 2022, the number of sworn officers was 11,611, which was down 1,742 officers from its peak four years prior.

==== 2017 Department of Justice report and agreement for enforcement ====
Following the McDonald shooting, Illinois attorney general Lisa Madigan requested that the Department of Justice (DOJ) conduct a civil rights investigation of the department. The agency released a report in January 2017, announcing an agreement with the city to work on improvements under court supervision. The report strongly criticized the police for a culture of excessive violence, especially against minority suspects and the community, and said that there was insufficient and poor training and a lack of true oversight.

The lack of training was one of the main targets of the DOJ report. The DOJ criticized the department for &quot;check the box&quot; training that relied heavily on PowerPoint presentations and included poorly executed training exercises in the field. The DOJ also observed recruits falling asleep during training.

In the aftermath of the investigation, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel approved the construction of a new training facility for the police and fire departments. The new building cost an estimated $95 million.

== Controversies ==

The Chicago Police Department has a history of scandals, police misconduct, corruption, police brutality, and other controversies. Since 2019, the CPD has been subject to a consent decree requiring the department to enact reforms in discipline, supervision, training and recruiting of its police officers. This was in the wake of a 2017 Department of Justice report which found that the CPD had a history of civil rights violations by officers, including a &quot;pattern and practice&quot; of police brutality and abuse.

===Summerdale scandals===

The Chicago Police Department did not face large-scale reorganization efforts until 1960 under Mayor Richard J. Daley. That year, eight officers from the Summerdale police district on Chicago&#x27;s North Side were accused of operating a large-scale burglary ring. The Summerdale case dominated the local press, and became the biggest police-related scandal in the city&#x27;s history at the time. Mayor Daley appointed a committee to make recommendations for improvements to the police department. The action resulted in the creation of a five-member board charged with nominating a superintendent to be the chief authority over police officers, enacting rules and regulations governing the police system, submitting budget requests to the city council, and overseeing disciplinary cases involving officers. Criminologist O.W. Wilson was brought on as Superintendent of Police, and served until 1967 when he retired.

===1968 Democratic National Convention===

Both Daley and the Chicago Police Department faced a great deal of criticism for the department&#x27;s actions during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Chicago from August 26 to 29, 1968.

The convention was the site of a series of protests, mainly over the war in Vietnam. Despite the poor behavior of some protesters, there was widespread criticism that the Chicago Police and National Guard used excessive force. &quot;Time&quot; published an article stating:

Subsequently, the Walker Report to the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence called the police response a &quot;police riot&quot;, assigning blame for the mayhem in the streets to the Chicago Police.

===The Black Panther raid===
On December 4, 1969, Black Panther Party leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were shot and killed by officers working for the Cook County state&#x27;s attorney, Edward Hanrahan. Though the police claimed they had been attacked by heavily armed Panthers, a subsequent investigation showed that all but one of the bullets fired came from police weapons. Relatives of the two dead men eventually won a multimillion-dollar judgment against the city. For many African Americans, the incident symbolized prejudice and lack of restraint among the largely white police. The incident led to growing black voter disaffection with the Democratic machine.

===Ryan Harris murder===
On July 28, 1998, an 11-year-old girl, Ryan Harris, was found raped and murdered in a vacant lot in the city&#x27;s Englewood neighborhood. The homicide caught the nation&#x27;s attention when, 12 days after Ryan&#x27;s body was found, authorities, with the blessing of police command, charged a 7-year-old boy and 8-year-old boy with the murder, making them the youngest murder suspects in the nation at the time. Semen found at the scene and subsequent DNA tests totally cleared the boys of the crime and pointed to convicted sex offender Floyd Durr. The boys each filed lawsuits against the city, which were eventually settled for millions of dollars. Durr pleaded guilty to the rape of Harris, but never admitted to her murder.

===Russ/Haggerty shootings===
In the summer of 1999, two unarmed black motorists, Robert Russ and LaTanya Haggerty, were fatally shot in separate incidents involving the Chicago Police. In the first incident, Russ, an honor student and star football player for Northwestern University, was shot in his car. This followed a high-speed chase and what the police claim was a struggle with the officer who shot him. In the second, Haggarty, a computer analyst, was shot by a female officer. Charges of racism against the CPD persisted. Both shootings resulted in lawsuits and Haggerty&#x27;s family reached an $18 million settlement with the city.

In Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s book on the cognitive function of snap judgments, &quot;Blink&quot;, well-known criminologist and police administrator James Fyfe said that Chicago police instructions in cases such as Russ&#x27;s were &quot;very detailed&quot;. He said that the record shows that the officers involved all broke procedure and let the situation become unnecessarily deadly for the suspect. For instance, after claiming to see Russ drive erratically, the officers engaged in a driving pursuit. The pursuit, labeled &quot;high-speed&quot;, did not exceed 70 miles per hour, but Fyfe contends that the adrenaline rush of the chase, coupled with the officers&#x27; reliance in their numbers, led to their ignoring impulses to maintain rational thinking in a potentially non-deadly situation. They speeded up a process that both allowed and required taking things more slowly and methodically. Russ&#x27;s car spun out on the Ryan Expressway, at which point several officers quickly approached his vehicle. According to Gladwell, the false safety of numbers gave the three officers &quot;the bravado to rush the car&quot;. Fyfe adds, &quot;The lawyers [for the police] were saying that this was a fast-breaking situation. But it was only fast-breaking because the cops let it become one. He was stopped. He wasn&#x27;t going anywhere.&quot;

Fyfe describes appropriate police procedure and contrasts the events that contributed to Russ&#x27;s death thus:

Gladwell also notes that the Russ and Haggerty killings occurred on the same night.

===Joseph Miedzianowski===
In April 2001, Joseph Miedzianowski was convicted of racketeering and drug conspiracy during much of his 22-year career with the department. In January 2003 he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. His partner John Galligan and 24 other drug dealers were also arrested as part of the same investigation.

===William Hanhardt===
In October 2001, Deputy Superintendent William Hanhardt pled guilty to running a nationwide jewel-theft ring that over twenty years may have stolen five million dollars&#x27; worth of diamonds and other gems. He had served with the department for 33 years and was sentenced to twelve years in federal custody.

===Eddie C. Hicks===
In December 2001, Sergeant Eddie C. Hicks was indicted for operating a gang with other CPD officers. The group would raid drug houses, taking the contraband for resale. Hicks skipped a court appearance on June 9, 2003, and was placed on the FBI&#x27;s most-wanted list. Hicks was arrested in Detroit on September 12, 2017, nearly 15 years after he fled on the eve of trial on federal drug conspiracy charges. Hicks, 68, has been the subject of an international manhunt since 2003, according to the FBI. He appeared in federal court in Detroit on Tuesday and was ordered held until he can be brought to Chicago to face the charges.

===Jon Burge torture allegations===
Since the early 1980s, official investigations have responded to numerous allegations against former Commander Jon Burge, who has been accused of abusing more than two-hundred mostly African-American men from 1972 to 1991 in order to coerce confessions to crimes. Alleged victims claimed that Burge and his crew of detectives had them beaten, suffocated, burned, and treated with electric shock. In 1993, Burge was fired from the department, and collected his police pension until his death in 2018. In summer 2006, special prosecutors completing a four-year investigation concluded that they had enough evidence to prove crimes against Burge and others, but &quot;regrettably&quot; could not bring charges because the statute of limitations had passed. In January 2008, the City Council approved a $19.8 million settlement with four men who claimed abuse by Burge and his men.

In October 2008, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, had Burge arrested on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury in relation to a civil suit regarding the torture allegations against him. Burge was eventually convicted on all counts on June 28, 2010, and was sentenced to four and one-half years in federal prison on January 21, 2011.

On May 6, 2015, Chicago City Council approved &quot;reparations&quot; of $5.5 million to victims of the torture, after spending $100 million in previous legal settlements. In addition, an apology was offered, and a promise to teach school children about these historical events.

According to a 2020 study, torture was used against 125 black suspects (many of whom were found to be innocent) over the years 1972 to 1991. In 2009, the Illinois state government created the Illinois Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission to investigate torture by police.

===Nurse arrests===

On November 19, 2002, Rachelle Jackson, a registered nurse, was on her way to work when she witnessed a vehicle accident involving a patrol car, in which Officer Kelly Brogan was dazed and her partner was unconscious. Fearing an explosion, Jackson removed both officers from the vehicle, and voluntarily went to the police station under the assumption of giving a statement after being informed that Brogan&#x27;s service weapon was stolen. Instead, she was interrogated for two days with little food or sleep and no access to a bathroom. She was coerced into signing a statement that she had battered Brogan and taken her gun. She was jailed for 10 months before the charges were dismissed. Jackson was awarded $7.9 million by a jury in her lawsuit against Brogan and the city. In 2009, the amount was reduced to $1.9 million. More than half the original verdict was awarded for &quot;intentional infliction of emotional distress.&quot;

=== Skullcap Crew ===
Skullcap Crew is a nickname given to a group of five Chicago Police officers in a gang tactical unit who have been the subject of abuse complaints by citizens. They have also won praise within the Chicago Police Department. They have been involved in more than 20 federal lawsuits.
===Bar attack===
In 2007, security camera footage surfaced of an intoxicated off-duty police officer, Anthony Abbate, punching and kicking a female bartender, Karolina Obrycka. This occurred at Jesse&#x27;s Shortstop Inn on February 19, 2007, after Obrycka refused to serve him any more alcohol. Abbate was later arrested, charged with felony battery, and stripped of police powers after TV news stations aired the footage. The Chicago Police soon terminated Abbate from the force, but questions remained over the city&#x27;s handling of the case.

Abbate was allowed to enter his courtroom hearing through a side door, in order to shield himself from the press. This generated controversy, and allegations surfaced that the police ticketed the vehicles of news organizations and threatened reporters with arrest. Superintendent Cline announced that he would demote the Captain who gave the orders, and launched investigations into the actions of the other officers involved.

On April 27, 2007, 14 additional charges against Abbate were announced. These included official misconduct, conspiracy, intimidation, and speaking with a witness. Abbate pleaded not guilty to all 15 charges during a brief hearing on May 16, 2007.

Referring to Abbate, Superintendent Phil Cline stated, &quot;He&#x27;s tarnished our image worse than anybody else in the history of the department.&quot; The video of the attack has been viewed worldwide on 24-hour news channels and has garnered more than 100,000 views on YouTube. In the wake of this scandal and a similar scandal related to another videotaped police beating at a bar, Cline announced his retirement on April 2, 2007. While both men have denied it, some believe that Cline retired under pressure from Mayor Richard M. Daley. Daley has since announced a plan to create an independent police review authority to replace the current Office of Professional Standards (OPS), which is under the jurisdiction of the police department.

On April 30, 2007, attorneys representing Obrycka filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the city of Chicago and Abbate and several other individuals. On November 13, 2012, a federal jury found that a &quot;widespread code of silence&quot; within the Chicago Police Department had allowed Abbate to feel that he could attack Obrycka without fear of reprisal. They also found that Abbate participated in a conspiracy to cover up the attack. The jury awarded Obrycka $850,000 in damages.

Abbate was convicted of aggravated battery, a felony, on June 2, 2009. Cook County Circuit Judge John J. Fleming rejected Abbate&#x27;s claims that he had acted in self-defense. However, since Obrycka testified that Abbate had not identified himself as an officer during the attack Abbate was acquitted of official misconduct charges. Abbate faced up to five years in prison for the attack. On June 23, 2009, Abbate was sentenced to two years probation, including a curfew between 8:00p.m. and 6:00a.m., mandatory attendance at anger management classes, and 130hours of community service.

On December 15, 2009, Abbate was officially fired from the Chicago Police Department after a mandatory review by the Chicago Civilian Police Board. The firing was a formality, as the Chicago Police Department does not allow convicted felons to serve on the force.

===Jerome Finnigan===
Chicago Police Officers Jerome Finnigan, Keith Herrera, Carl Suchocki, and Thomas Sherry were indicted in September 2007 for robbery, kidnapping, home invasion, and other charges. They were alleged to have robbed drug dealers and ordinary citizens of money, drugs, and guns. The officers were all part of Special Operations Sections (SOS). The officers had allegedly victimized citizens for years; however, allegations of their misconduct were not investigated until 2004. According to the State&#x27;s Attorney, the officers repeatedly missed court dates and allowed alleged drug dealers to go free. Several lawsuits alleging misconduct on behalf of Finnigan and his team have been filed in federal court. Since the original indictments, Jerome Finnigan has also been charged with attempting to have several fellow officers killed. Since the scandal involving Finnigan, SOS has been disbanded.

On February 11, 2009, charges against Chicago Police Department officers Tom Sherry and Carl Suchocki were dropped. A Cook County judge dismissed all criminal charges accusing them of robbery and home invasion after some evidence was proven to be false, and witnesses in the case against Sherry and Suchocki were unable to place the officers at the scene of the crime. Charges against Herrera and Finnigan, however, are still pending. As of September 25, 2009, seven former SOS officers have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the scandal. The investigation is ongoing as police officers continue to come forward and cooperate with the state and federal investigation.

===Shooting of Flint Farmer===

On June 7, 2011, Flint Farmer was fatally shot three times in the back by Chicago police officer Gildardo Sierra. Sierra and a partner had responded to a domestic disturbance call allegedly involving Farmer. When confronted by the police, Farmer fled. Sierra shot at Farmer multiple times, hitting him in the leg and abdomen. Publicly available police video shows Sierra circle the prone Farmer as three bright flashes emit from approximately waist level. The coroner who performed the autopsy on Farmer reported that Farmer could have survived the shots to the leg and abdomen, but any of the three shots through the back would have been fatal. Officer Sierra had been involved in two other shootings in 2011. Although the Chicago police department ruled the shooting justified, by October 23, 2011, Sierra had been stripped of his police powers and the FBI had opened an investigation into the incident. Eventually, no charges were brought against the officers. The city settled the civil case with Farmer&#x27;s family for $4.1 million but did not admit fault.

===Richard Zuley===

Richard Zuley was a police detective who retired from the Chicago Police Department in 2007. After his retirement, multiple inquiries into overturned convictions that had relied on confessions he coerced triggered the Conviction Integrity Unit of the Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s Office to plan to subpoena Zuley&#x27;s entire complaint history.

Zuley faces multiple lawsuits from individuals who claim he framed them, or beat confessions from them.
Lathierial Boyd was exonerated and freed in 2013 after serving 23 years in prison, based on evidence from Zuley and suppression of exculpatory evidence. He filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, as well as suing the city, saying that Zuley framed him for a murder and attempted murder outside a nightclub in 1990. Anthony Garrett, who received a 100-year sentence for killing a seven-year-old boy, alleged Zuley beat his confession out of him.

On February 18, 2015, Spencer Ackerman, reporting in &quot;The Guardian,&quot; covered Zuley&#x27;s alleged involvement in the torture and forced confessions of several homicide cases in Chicago. He said several inmates claimed abuse by Zuley.

In addition, he revealed additional details of Zuley&#x27;s participation as a US Navy Reserve lieutenant from late 2002 to 2004 in the interrogation and torture of Guantanamo captive Mohamedou Ould Slahi. Slahi was among several men classified by the US as high-value detainees, for whom the Secretary of Defense authorized enhanced interrogation techniques, since characterized as torture.

Jason Meisner, writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot; reported that &quot;The Guardian&quot; characterized Zuley&#x27;s use of torture as &quot;brutal and ineffective&quot;. Memos Zuley wrote, quoted in the Senate Intelligence Committee&#x27;s report on the CIA&#x27;s use of torture, described him using &quot;stress positions&quot;—the shackling of interrogation subjects in painful postures for extended periods of time. Zuley currently faces lawsuits in Chicago for using these techniques against American civilians.

===Homan Square===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in February 2015 that the Chicago Police Department &quot;operates an off-the-books interrogation compound, rendering Americans unable to be found by family or attorneys while locked inside what lawyers say is the domestic equivalent of a CIA black site.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; added that the facility, the Homan Square Police Warehouse at 1011 S. Homan Ave in Chicago (), &quot;has long been the scene of secretive work by special police units.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that interviews with local attorneys and one protester &quot;describe operations that deny access to basic constitutional rights ... The secretive warehouse ... trains its focus on Americans, most often poor, black and brown ... Witnesses, suspects or other Chicagoans who end up inside do not appear to have a public, searchable record entered into a database indicating where they are, as happens when someone is booked at a precinct. Lawyers and relatives insist there is no way of finding their whereabouts. Those lawyers who have attempted to gain access to Homan Square are most often turned away, even as their clients remain in custody inside.&quot;

After &quot;The Guardian&quot; published the story, the Chicago Police provided a statement saying, without specifics, that there is nothing improper taking place at what it called the &quot;sensitive&quot; location, home to undercover units. The statement said &quot;CPD [Chicago Police Department] abides by all laws, rules and guidelines pertaining to any interviews of suspects or witnesses, at Homan Square or any other CPD facility. If lawyers have a client detained at Homan Square, just like any other facility, they are allowed to speak to and visit them.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; said several attorneys and one Homan Square arrestee have denied this. The CPD statement continued by saying &quot;There are always records of anyone who is arrested by CPD, and this is not any different at Homan Square.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the Chicago Police statement did not address how long after an arrest or detention those records are generated or their availability to the public, and that a department spokesperson did not respond to a detailed request for clarification.

In October 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported a number of statistics they were able to uncover about the operation of the Homan Square site. They said that between August 2004 and June 2015, more than 7,000 people had been detained there (more than 6,000 of whom were black, a rate more than twice that of the city&#x27;s population). Only 68 of those were given access to an attorney, there were no known instances in which the public was notified about a detention while the person was being held there, and those held there were not given access to telephones. Despite police directives to rapidly complete the booking process for detainees, there was no booking facility at the site and no such records had been generated there, and some detainees had been kept there for days. The statistics included only people who were eventually charged with a crime, as the police did not release information about those held there without being charged, saying it would be too difficult to provide that information. David Gaeger, an attorney who had represented clients taken to the facility, said &quot;Try finding a phone number for Homan to see if anyone&#x27;s there. You can&#x27;t, ever. If you&#x27;re laboring under the assumption that your client&#x27;s at Homan, there really isn&#x27;t much you can do as a lawyer. You&#x27;re shut out. It&#x27;s guarded like a military installation.&quot; and &quot;That place was and is scary. There&#x27;s nothing about it that resembles a police station.&quot;

=== Laquan McDonald ===
On October 20, 2014, 17-year-old Laquan McDonald was fatally shot by Officer Jason Van Dyke. The murder sparked protests and calls for the mayor to resign. A video was released which revealed McDonald walking down a street, carrying a knife. McDonald was walking parallel to the two police cars when he was shot 16 times. A criminal complaint filed in Cook County Circuit Court revealed that Van Dyke was the only officer to shoot, and the complaint also said that McDonald was on PCP at the time of his death. Protestors were frustrated that the video took 13 months to be released. A freelance journalist sued to have the footage released as it was a public record, and a judge found in the reporter&#x27;s favor and the video became public in November 2015.

Van Dyke was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of official misconduct. He remained on desk duty after the shooting. Van Dyke had a history of complaints in his career but was cleared in a majority of the cases. He pleaded not guilty on December 29, 2015, to the charges against him. After his arraignment, his attorney, Daniel Herbert, said that he would be looking for evidence to clear his client&#x27;s name. On October 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm, but was found not guilty of official misconduct. On January 18, 2019, Van Dyke was sentenced to 6.75 years in prison for the second-degree murder conviction alone.

=== Raiding wrong addresses ===
Due to errors or acting on bad or faulty tips without double-checking information, Chicago police have raided incorrect addresses with no-knock warrants more than once in recent years. This has adversely affected goodwill towards officers in the community and costs the city in legal settlements. While new search warrant policies have been implemented by the CPD, including mandatory pre-checks and additional supervisors, one victim said she still believes the police department has a long way to go, and is &quot;traumatizing Black Chicagoans in the process&quot;.

== Fallen officers ==
On December 5, 1853, James Quinn became the first Chicago police officer killed while on duty. 8 officers were killed and 59 were wounded during the Haymarket affair. Dorelle C. Brandon was killed on January 25, 1984, the first female officer to die on duty.

Since 1853, the Chicago Police Department has lost 571 officers in the line of duty. 40% of these deaths occurred between 1920 and 1939. By custom, the department retires the stars of fallen officers and mounts them in a display case at Police Headquarters.

==Appearances in popular culture==
* The 1957–1960 television series &quot;M Squad&quot; centered on a squad of Chicago Police detectives. The episode &quot;The Jumper&quot; featured an officer taking bribes. It was reportedly this depiction that prompted then-Mayor Richard J. Daley to thereafter discourage motion picture and television location filming in the city for the rest of his administration and its aftermath. John Landis&#x27; successful 1980 musical comedy motion picture &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (see more below) marked the reversal of that policy by Mayor Jane Byrne.
* Two notable exceptions to Daley&#x27;s ban were made for films released in 1975. In &quot;Brannigan&quot;, John Wayne portrays Chicago Police Lieutenant Jim Brannigan. &quot;Cooley High&quot; (set in 1964) was filmed entirely in Chicago and features a car chase through Navy Pier&#x27;s warehouse buildings (since demolished), in which the pursuing Chicago police are repeatedly outmaneuvered by the joyriding teens.
* The Chicago Police Department and Illinois State Police are featured in the climactic car chase in 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; in which a Chicago Police dispatcher matter-of-factly advises responding officers that &quot;The use of unnecessary violence in the apprehension of the Blues Brothers has been approved.&quot; Reportedly in response to their portrayal in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, the Chicago Police Department banned the use of the &quot;Chicago Police&quot; name and insignia in films until the early 2000s, resulting in several films and television shows replacing &quot;Chicago Police&quot; with &quot;Metro Police&quot; and other faux names, even if the films received technical assistance from the department, such as &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;The Negotiator&quot;.
* The television series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981–1987) never explicitly stated the name of the city in which it was set, although many exterior views (lacking the principal actors) were filmed in Chicago and used for establishing and transition shots. 
* The television series &quot;Crime Story&quot; (1986–1988) had most of its first season set in Chicago in 1963. The opening credits feature clips including vehicles and passenger aircraft from that era.
* In the 1988 movie &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, Chicago police officer Mark Norris (played by Chris Sarandon) and his colleague chase criminals Charles Lee Ray and Frank. In other scenes, there are various other CPD officers.
* Robert De Niro portrays a former Chicago police officer turned bounty hunter in the 1988 film &quot;Midnight Run&quot;. Numerous references are made to the CPD as well as corruption within the department. There are also a number of scenes directly involving the CPD.
* The Chicago Police Department played a major role in 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, showing them in a semi-brutal fashion after Kimble is incorrectly believed to have killed an on-duty police officer. The use of actual Chicago Police Department vehicles and uniforms is extensive and can be seen throughout the film. CPD can be seen again in its 1998 sequel, U.S. Marshals.
* In the 1998 film &quot;The Negotiator&quot;, the Chicago Police played a major role within the film. The real Chicago Police Department provided technical support for the movie&#x27;s SWAT teams. The actors&#x27; shoulder sleeve insignia were similar to the Chicago Police Department&#x27;s octagonal patches, albeit with &quot;Chicago&quot; replaced with &quot;Metropolitan.&quot;
* Chicago police officers are routinely depicted on the television series &quot;ER&quot;.
* The Chicago police are portrayed in the 2011 Fox Network series &quot;The Chicago Code&quot;. Unlike most depictions of Chicago police, the actors&#x27; uniforms and insignia appear to be identical to their real-world counterparts, with the series being filmed on-location in the city.

==Tactics, softwares and equipment==
=== Community policing ===

The Chicago Police Department does community policing through the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy program. It was established in 1992 and implemented in 1993 by then-Chicago Police Superintendent Matt L. Rodriguez. The program entails increasing police presence in individual communities with a force of neighborhood-based beat officers. Beat Community Meetings are held regularly for community members and police officials to discuss potential problems and strategies.

Under CAPS, 9-10 beat officers are assigned to each of Chicago&#x27;s 279 police beats. The officers patrol the same beat for over a year, allowing them to get to know community members, residents, and business owners and to become familiar with community attitudes and trends. The system also allows for those same community members to get to know their respective officers and learn to be comfortable in approaching them for help when needed.

=== Strategic Subject List (SSL) ===

The Strategic Subject List (SSL) is a list of individuals generated by computer using a customized implementation of an algorithm developed by the Illinois Institute of Technology. The SSL algorithm calculates the propensity of individuals either committing or being targeted by gun violence. Now in its fourth iteration, the SSL has become a helpful indicator of the likelihood of murder, according to former Superintendent of Police Eddie Johnson. The algorithm looks at an individual&#x27;s past criminal activities whilst specifically excluding biasing variables like race, gender, ethnicity, and location, according to Illinois Institute of Technology professor Miles Wernick, and assigns scores to individuals based on criminal record, known gang affiliation, and other variables.

As of 2016, the CPD created a list of 1,400 &quot;strategic subjects&quot; that has proven to be reliable and helpful to the department. By the end of 2016, more than 70percent of firearm victims and 80percent of the shooters appeared on the SSL. Moreover, of the 140individuals who were arrested during a citywide gang raid performed that same year, 117 of them (83.6%) were on the list according to the CPD.

The SSL is also used by social workers and community leaders.

===Equipment===


Chicago police officers are required to buy their own duty equipment (except Taser x2 and Motorola radio Motorola phone). All field officers must also be qualified to carry a Taser. Some officers choose to carry a backup weapon as well, which must meet certain specifications and requires annual qualification.

The prescribed semiautomatic pistol must meet the following requirements:

* Be manufactured by Beretta, SIG, Glock, Ruger, Smith &amp; Wesson, or Springfield Armory.
* Be chambered in 9mm, .40 S&amp;W, or .45 ACP.
* Be double-action only, hammer or striker-fired.

Officers who were hired on or before 1 December 1991 may keep their older double-action/single-action pistols, as well as their 4&quot; barrel Smith &amp; Wesson, Ruger or Colt revolvers in .38 Special or .357 Magnum. Recruits hired on or after 28 August 2015 must choose from Springfield Armory, Smith &amp; Wesson, or Glock striker-fired 9mm pistols. Officers hired before 19 May 2008 may continue to use the Double Action Only (DAO) Beretta, Ruger, SIG Sauer, and S&amp;W pistols for duty use.

It was reported in June 2018 that the agency would allow the authorization of the SIG Sauer P320 as another service pistol to be chosen by officers to carry. Shortly after the P320 appeared on the authorized firearms list.

Patrol vehicles contain long gun racks. Remington 870 12-gauge shotguns are available in the event that additional firepower is needed. Officers must complete five days of training to carry an AR-15 type rifle and have the option to purchase their own or use a department-provided one.

<doc id="753110" wikidata="Q1465068" url="?curid=753110" title="George Cornwallis-West">
<text>Major George Frederick Myddleton Cornwallis-West (14 November 1874 – 1 April 1951) was a British Army officer, historian and writer. He was noted primarily for his marriages, the first to Lady Randolph Churchill, mother of Winston Churchill, and the second to the actress Stella Campbell, who was also known on the stage as Mrs Patrick Campbell. During his marriage to Jennie Jerome Churchill, George Cornwallis-West was noted for being only 16 days older than his stepson Winston Churchill.

==Early life==
George Cornwallis-West was born on 14 November 1874. He was the only son of Colonel William Cornwallis-West (1835–1917) and his wife, Mary &quot;Patsy&quot; FitzPatrick (1856–1920).

==Military career==
Cornwallis-West served in the Scots Guards, becoming a lieutenant. He went on half pay on 8 August 1900, returned briefly to his regiment and then went on half pay again on 5 September. Cornwallis-West resigned his commission on 26 October 1901 and then joined the Reserve of Officers as a lieutenant on 26 February 1902. On 7 November 1914 Cornwallis-West was given a temporary commission as a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Marines. He resigned this rank, with which he had served in the Royal Naval Division, on 19 January 1915. 

He was promoted to captain in the Scots Guards on 18 October, an earlier promotion to that rank in January having later been cancelled. By 16 February 1917, Cornwallis-West was serving as an assistant provost marshal and he was listed as part of the Reserve of Officers; he was still in that position on 23 October. On 1 October 1918, he was made a temporary major for his work as a provost marshal. 

Continuing in the Reserve of Officers after the end of the First World War, Cornwallis-West left his position as a provost marshal, and reverted to his substantial rank of captain, on 13 November 1919. He was then promoted to major on 9 February 1920. He retired from the army on 14 November 1924, having reached the age limit for reserve officers.

== Personal life ==
Cornwallis-West and Lady Randolph Churchill were married on 28 July 1900. The wedding was held at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge. They separated in 1912 and divorced on 1 April 1914, but continued to meet socially upon occasion. After their divorce, she returned to her former name: Lady Randolph Churchill. On 6 April 1914, Cornwallis-West married Beatrice Stella Tanner Campbell, an actress known (under her previous husband&#x27;s name) as &quot;Mrs Patrick Campbell&quot;. George Bernard Shaw wrote the part of Eliza Doolittle in his play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; for her.

Cornwallis-West&#x27;s elder sister, née Mary Theresa Cornwallis-West, was a noted society beauty. Known as Daisy, Princess of Pless, she was the first wife of Hans Heinrich XV, Prince of Pless. His younger sister, Constance, became the first wife of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster.

In 1951, aged 76, after having been afflicted for many years with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Cornwallis-West committed suicide in his apartment at 9 North Audley Street, Westminster, leaving an estate valued for probate at £12,255. He left no legitimate children.

== Portrayals in film and television ==
Cornwallis-West was portrayed by Christopher Cazenove in the 1974 Thames TV mini-series &quot;Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill&quot;.

<text>A cowlick is a section of human hair that stands straight up or lies at an angle at odds with the style in which the rest of an individual&#x27;s hair is worn.

The most common site of a human cowlick is in the crown, but they can appear anywhere on the head. They also sometimes occur in the front and back of the head.

The term &quot;cowlick&quot; dates from the late 16th century, when physician Richard Haydock used it in his translation of Gian Paolo Lomazzo: &quot;The lockes or plaine feakes of haire called cow-lickes, are made turning upwards.&quot;

==Management==
For people who are very concerned about cowlick management, drastic measures may have to be used. Electrology, waxing, and even cosmetic surgery can be used to permanently alter the cowlick.

<text>The Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA; ) was Israel&#x27;s public broadcaster from 1948 to 2017, succeeded by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation.

==History==

The Israel Broadcasting Authority was an outgrowth of the radio station &quot;Kol Yisrael&quot;, which made its first broadcast as an independent station on 14 March 1948. The name of the organization operating &quot;Kol Yisrael&quot; was changed to &quot;Israel Broadcasting Service&quot; in 1951. The law creating the &quot;Israel Broadcasting Authority&quot; was passed by the Knesset on 6 June 1965. Television broadcasts commenced on 2 May 1968, with color television following on 23 February 1983, although occasional color transmissions, of such events as the Eurovision Song Contest 1979 and the visit of the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1977, had been made earlier.
IBA operated two television channels and eight radio stations.

In 1990, the Israeli parliament passed a law that resulted in the creation of the Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority, whose function was to enable and regulate commercial television and private radio broadcasts in Israel. Before the establishment of the Second Broadcasting Authority and the subsequent widespread availability in Israel of cable television and satellite pay TV services (which also produce their own programming directed at the local market in the early 1990s (cable) and 2001 (satellite DTH service), the IBA had enjoyed a virtual monopoly of television and radio broadcasting and production in the country. There were a few exceptions, such as the morning and afternoon broadcasts produced by Israel Educational Television and delivered via the IBA&#x27;s television channel, the popular Israel Defense Forces Radio service, and a private radio station (&quot;the Voice of Peace&quot;) which operated offshore, outside Israeli territorial waters.

Most of the Israel Broadcasting Authority&#x27;s domestic programming was funded until the end of 2015 by the levying of television license fees upon the owners of television sets. This fee was the primary source of revenue for the IBA&#x27;s television services; however, its radio stations, however, carried full advertising and its TV programs were sometimes &quot;sponsored&quot; by commercial entities as a supplement to this income. Additionally, all car owners in Israel paid a radio levy through their annual car ownership license. IBA broadcasting was covered by the code of ethics set out in the Nakdi Report.

The IBA (IBS at the time) was admitted as a fully active member of the European Broadcasting Union in 1957. The decision made by the EBU General Assembly had the immediate effect that two founding broadcasters (the Egyptian and Syrian broadcasting services) quit as active members.

The IBA provided news programming in 14 foreign languages, directed at audiences both abroad and in Israel through its IBA News programming available on the internet and through rebroadcasters. The IBA ceased to use shortwaves for its radio overseas transmissions in the mid-2000s.

In 2014, the Israeli cabinet approved reforms that would see the IBA closed and a new public broadcasting body take its place. The replacement network would operate three separate television channels: a Hebrew, an Arabic, and a children&#x27;s channel. As part of the reforms, the television tax levied on all Israelis who own televisions to support the IBA was to be abolished by March 2015. Eventually, the reform did not advance as originally planned and the target date was extended to 2018. Eight new national radio stations were to be created in place of the existing Kol Israel radio network.

The IBA was supposed to be replaced by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC) on 1 October 2016, but the launch was postponed until the beginning of 2018. The proposed model for the IPBC had been criticized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which opposed the tying of the IPBC&#x27;s finances to budgets decided upon directly by politicians and the planned absence of news services. EBU rules prescribe that a public broadcaster must provide a news service in order to qualify for membership. After several delays, the plans were changed to allow the IPBC to start its operations on 15 May 2017.

== Closure ==
Two hours before the broadcast of &quot;Mabat LaHadashot&quot; (A Glance at the News) on 9 May 2017, the staff was informed that it would be the last show. Partial programming on Channel 1 resumed the next day, without news programs, while Channel 33 was shut down with just a slide explaining the closure in Arabic. All IBA Radio stations continued to broadcast news on the hour and music programming until 15 May.

The final program shown by the IBA TV Channel 1 was the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 where Israel was a finalist. A minimal crew of twenty people had remained to ensure a smooth broadcast of the second semi-final on 11 May, with the grand final on 13 May. The program was televised on Channel 1 with no commentary and subtitles during the program for voting purposes.

<text>Harry Gustaf Nikolai Gädda, better known as Nicolai Gedda (11 July 1925 – 8 January 2017), was a Swedish operatic tenor. Debuting in 1951, Gedda had a long and successful career in opera until the age of 77 in June 2003, when he made his final operatic recording. Skilled at languages, he performed operas in French, Russian, German, Italian, English, Czech and Swedish, as well as one in Latin. In January 1958, he created the part of Anatol in the world premiere of the American opera &quot;Vanessa&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. Having made some two hundred recordings, Gedda is one of the most widely recorded opera singers in history. His singing is best known for its beauty of tone, vocal control, and musical perception.

==Early years==
Harry Gustaf Nikolai Gädda, who later changed the spelling of his surname to Gedda, was born out of wedlock in Stockholm to a Swedish mother and a half-Russian father. He was raised by his aunt Olga Gädda and his adoptive father Michail Ustinov (a distant relative of Peter Ustinov), who sang bass in Serge Jaroff&#x27;s Don Cossack Choir and was cantor in a Russian Orthodox church. Gedda grew up bilingual in Swedish and Russian, and from 1929 to 1934 when his family were living in Leipzig, Germany, he learned German. At the age of 5 Gedda took part in a vocal quartet in the orthodox church in the city. They returned to Sweden in 1934, and the boy attended Katarina Secondary School and the Södra Grammar School. In school he learned English, French and Latin, learning Italian on his own after leaving school.

Gedda worked first as a bank teller in a local bank in Stockholm, and was obliged to support his hard-pressed parents financially; his sleeping arrangements were an alcove off the kitchen in their Stockholm apartment. One day he told a customer – a member of the Royal Opera House Orchestra – that he was searching for a good singing teacher, and the client recommended Carl Martin Öhman, a well known Wagnerian tenor from the 1920s, who is also credited with discovering Jussi Björling. Öhman was enthusiastic about Gedda and took him as a pupil, at the beginning without payment, because Gedda was at the time supporting his parents. Two months later his progress was such that he obtained a grant and then won the Christine Nilsson Prize. After a few months he obtained a scholarship, and was later able to pay for Öhman&#x27;s singing lessons. At the Royal Academy of Music and Opera School in Stockholm Gedda was in the class of Kurt Bendix and Ragnar Hyltén-Cavallius from 1950 to 1952.

==Opera career==

Gedda made his debut at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm as part of the vocal quartet in the premiere of &quot;Der rote Stiefel&quot; by Sutermeister in November 1951. In April 1952, at the age of 26, Gedda made his triumphant debut in a principal role in Stockholm, performing Chapelou in Adolphe Adam&#x27;s &quot;Le postillon de Lonjumeau&quot;, alongside Hjördis Schymberg. The &#x27;Ronde du Postillon&#x27; in the opera, (&quot;Mes amis, écoutez l&#x27;histoire&quot;), is considered one of the most difficult tenor arias in all of opera, as it calls for a demanding high D from the soloist.

An early appraisal of Gedda&#x27;s singing was offered by Walter Legge, after first hearing Gedda sing for the role of &quot;Dmitry&quot; in a planned recording of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;.
On my arrival at the airport I was asked by a swarm of journalists if I were not interested in hearing their excellent young Swedish voices. Naturally I was interested, but I did not expect either the front page stories that appeared next morning or the mass of letters and almost incessant telephone calls asking to be heard. I had to ask the Director of the Opera for a room for a couple of days to hear about 100 young aspirants. The first to sing to me (at 9.30 in the morning) was Gedda who had, I believe, sung only once in public. He sang the &quot;Carmen&quot; Flower Song so tenderly yet passionately that I was moved almost to tears. He delivered the difficult rising scale ending with a clear and brilliant B flat. Almost apologetically I asked him to try to sing it as written – &quot;pianissimo, rallentando&quot; and &quot;diminuendo&quot;. Without turning a hair he achieved the near-miracle, incredibly beautifully and without effort. I asked him to come back at 8 that evening and sent word to my wife that a great singer had fallen into my lap and to Dobrowen that, believe it or not, this 23-year-old Gedda was the heaven-sent Dmitry for our Boris.

As a result of the audition with Legge, Gedda was contracted for three HMV opera recordings – &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, &quot;Die Lustige Witwe&quot; and &quot;Das Land des Lächelns&quot; – as well as the B minor mass by Bach and a Swedish song recital accompanied by Bendix. In 1953, he made his début at La Scala as Don Ottavio in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, followed by one of the tenor soloists in the premiere of Orff&#x27;s &quot;Trionfo di Afrodite&quot;. In January the following year he made his debut at the Paris Opera as Damon in &quot;Les Indes galantes&quot;, with Huon in Weber&#x27;s &quot;Oberon&quot; and Tamino in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; in the same year, Alfredo in &quot;La traviata&quot; and the Duke of Mantua in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; in 1956, Cassio in &quot;Otello&quot; in 1957 and the title role in &quot;Faust&quot; in 1961. He was based in France at this time, and began an association with the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1954, starting with Belmonte in &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; and Vincent in &quot;Mireille&quot;, then Orphée in &quot;Orphée et Eurydice&quot;, Thespis and Mercure in &quot;Platée&quot;, and Ferrando in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;; several productions being recorded. &quot;Diapason&quot; magazine described him as the greatest French tenor of his generation, both for his essential casting in &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, but also for his role in the re-emergence of interest in French grand opera, which owed much to his ability to match the requirements of roles such as Arnold in &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, the Cellini and Enée of Berlioz, as well as the title role of Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Le prophète&quot;. In 1966, prior to assuming the role at Covent Garden, Gedda said that Cellini was one of his favourite parts; when he prepared the role for the Holland Festival production in 1961 he became totally absorbed in the historical figure of the 16th-century Italian goldsmith and sculptor.

In Salzburg, he took part in the August 1957 premiere of the three-act version of Rolf Liebermann&#x27;s &quot;Die Schule der Frauen&quot; (as Oronte), conducted by George Szell, where Gedda &quot;matched his free lyric tenor with an animation of personality that came as a surprise&quot;. After his U.S debut as Faust in Pittsburgh in 1957, Gedda made his Metropolitan Opera debut in the title role of Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; the same year, and went on to sing 28 roles there over the next 26 years, including Anatol in the world premiere of Barber&#x27;s &quot;Vanessa&quot; and the U.S. premiere of Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Last Savage&quot;. He was the last singer to stand on the stage of the &#x27;old Met&#x27;: the final curtain of the gala evening fell after his appearance in the finale from &quot;Faust&quot;.

Gedda made his Royal Opera House Covent Garden début in 1954 as the Duke in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (in English). He returned in 1963 for &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot; and for &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; (in 1966, 1969 and 1976); Alfredo in 1972, Gustavus III in 1977, Nemorino in 1981, Lensky (in 1979 and 1982) and Abdisu in &quot;Palestrina&quot;.

Gedda&#x27;s only foray in Wagner was the title role in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in Stockholm in January 1966, where one critic wrote that his &quot;command of intonation and rhythm contributed to an overwhelmingly beautiful impression right from his unaccompanied appearance in the first act&quot;. He was supposed to sing Lohengrin at the Bayreuth Festival in 1967, but his engagement for an American television film of &quot;Faust&quot; in the summer of that year prevented it.

Gedda made more than 200 complete LP and CD recordings over a wide variety of styles and several of the roles may be considered among the most challenging in the entire operatic repertoire, notably Arnold in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; and Arturo in &quot;I puritani&quot;, both requiring high notes and an easy legato line. In recordings he was also noted in lighter opera, whether the Viennese operettas of Strauss (&quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, &quot;Eine Nacht in Venedig&quot;, &quot;Wienerblut&quot;) or Lehár (&quot;Die lustige Witwe&quot;, &quot;Das Land des Lächelns&quot;), in Bernstein (&quot;Candide&quot;) or Hahn (&quot;Ciboulette&quot;).

He had a small role in the 1952 film &quot;Eldfågeln&quot;, in which he sang &quot;Ack, Värmeland du sköna&quot;.

A singer of unusual longevity, Gedda was active well into his late 70s; in May 2001 he recorded the role of the Emperor Altoum in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; and the role of the High Priest in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; in June 2003.

==Art song==
In addition to his opera performances, Gedda cultivated an active parallel career on the concert platform and as a recitalist, with a large repertoire of French, German, Scandinavian, and Russian art songs as well as larger works for the concert platform. As an interpreter of Lieder he performed for over 25 years with the pianist . Gedda&#x27;s language skills, intellectual approach and musicality, as well as his extensive recordings, rendered him particularly indispensable in this genre. He also sang, and recorded, sacred music, including Russian liturgical music. His discography includes large-scale sacred works such as the Mozart Requiem, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Christ on the Mount of Olives&quot;, &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; and Ninth Symphony, &quot;Lélio, ou le retour à la vie&quot;, &quot;Elijah&quot;, the Verdi Requiem and &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;; while his song repertoire extended beyond Swedish composers and folksongs to Schubert, Schumann, a wide range of Russian romances from Glinka to Rachmaninoff, mélodies, Janáček&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of One Who Disappeared&quot;, and many Russian folksongs.

== Honours ==
In 1965 he became a Swedish Court Singer and in 1966 he was inducted into the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. In 1968 he was a recipient of the Swedish royal medal Litteris et Artibus. In 1976 he was awarded the Gold Medal for the Promotion of the Art of Music (Swedish: &quot;För tonkonstens främjande&quot;) by the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and in 2007 he received the Caruso prize.

In 2010 he received the Legion of Honor (Légion d&#x27;honneur), the highest French decoration, from then president of France Nicolas Sarkozy.

Gedda was a visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London, and in 1994 he was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy.

== Personal life ==
Outside music Gedda had many hobbies, as a keen sportsman, a connoisseur of painting and sculpture, and well-read in literature, often reading works of major novelists in the original where he commanded the language. He also had a passion for visiting zoos, saying that if he did not have to travel for his profession he would like &quot;to keep a complete menagerie in my home&quot;.

His first marriage was to the pianist Nadine Sapounoff-Nova (1953–1961), his second to Anastasia Caraviotis, an American of Greek origin (1965–1991), and last from 1997 to the journalist and writer Aino Sellermark.

He published his first memoir, &quot;Gåvan är inte gratis&quot; (The gift is not free) in 1977, with the help of his future wife, Aino Sellermark. This was translated as &quot;Nicolai Gedda: My Life and Art&quot;, which Amadeus Press published in 1999.

His death on 8 January 2017, aged 91, was not announced by his family until 9 February 2017. He died after a heart attack at his home in Tolochenaz in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. He was buried in an unmarked memorial plot () in Galärvarvskyrkogården, Stockholm.

<text>Pierre-Laurent Aimard (born 9 September 1957) is a French pianist. He focuses on contemporary music.

== Biography ==
Aimard was born in Lyon, where he entered the conservatory. Later he studied with Yvonne Loriod and with Maria Curcio.

In 1973, he was awarded the chamber music prize of the Paris Conservatoire. In the same year, he won the first prize at the international Olivier Messiaen Competition. In 1977, at the invitation of Pierre Boulez, he became a founding member of the Ensemble InterContemporain. He made his American debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the age of twenty, performing the piano solo part in Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot;.

Aimard is particularly committed to contemporary music. He was the soloist in several premieres of works such as &quot;Répons&quot; by Pierre Boulez, &quot;Klavierstück XIV&quot; by Karlheinz Stockhausen, and the eleventh and thirteenth piano études of György Ligeti. One of his most notable recordings is that of the first two books of Ligeti&#x27;s piano études. He has also performed the work of contemporary composers such as George Benjamin, Roberto Carnevale and Marco Stroppa. In May 2012, he premiered Tristan Murail&#x27;s piano concerto &quot;Le Désenchantement du Monde&quot;.

Aimard was one of Carnegie Hall&#x27;s &quot;Perspectives&quot; artists for the 2006–2007 concert season, where he programmed his own series of concerts. He served as artist-in-residence with the Cleveland Orchestra for two seasons, from 2007 to 2009. In 2007 Aimard was the Music Director of the Ojai Music Festival.

In addition to his work with contemporary music, Aimard has recorded the five Beethoven piano concertos with Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, at the invitation of Harnoncourt. Aimard has recorded for the Sony Classical and Teldec labels. In August 2007, he signed a new recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon.

Aimard has recently extended his musical activities to conducting, although he characterized his interest and gift for conducting as follows:

In 2009, Aimard became the Artistic Director of the Aldeburgh Festival in England, for an initial contract of 3 years. Aimard is a visiting professor and an Honorary Member (2006) of the Royal Academy of Music. He appears in the 2007 film &quot;Note by Note: The Making of Steinway L1037&quot;.

Aimard was featured recording Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; in the 2009 award-winning German-Austrian documentary &quot;Pianomania&quot;, about Steinway &amp; Sons&#x27; piano technician Stefan Knüpfer, which was directed by Lilian Franck and Robert Cibis. The film premiered theatrically in North America, where it was met with positive reviews by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as well as in Asia and throughout Europe, and is a part of the Goethe-Institut catalogue.

In 2017 Aimard signed with the PENTATONE label. Under this collaboration Aimard intends to record key works from his repertoire, spanning three centuries and ranging from Bach to Kurtág, beginning with his first ever recording of Messiaen&#x27;s Catalogue d&#x27;Oiseaux.

In 2024, Aimard premiered Mark Andre&#x27;s &quot;...selig ist...&quot; at the Donaueschingen Festival.

<text>The Civil War Campaign Medal is considered the first campaign service medal of the United States Armed Forces. The decoration was awarded to members of the United States Armed Forces who had served in the American Civil War between 1861 and 1865.

==Establishment==
The medal was first authorized in 1905 for the fortieth anniversary of the Civil War&#x27;s conclusion. The blue and gray ribbon denotes the respective uniform colors of the U.S. and Confederate troops. The Army Civil War Campaign Medal was established by the United States War Department on January 21, 1907, by General Orders Number 12. To qualify, a soldier had to serve between April 15, 1861, and April 9, 1865. The closing date was extended to August 20, 1866, date of President Johnson&#x27;s Proclamation ending the war. The corresponding Navy Civil War Medal was established on June 27, 1908, by Navy Department.

The obverse of the Army Civil War Campaign Medal displayed an engraved image of Abraham Lincoln while the Navy and Marine Corps versions depicted the and &#x27;s battle at Hampton Roads. The reverse has the words &quot;The Civil War 1861-1865&quot; encircled by a wreath. The medal was designed by Francis D. Millet, a noted sculptor who perished on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912. The medal was struck at the Philadelphia Mint. Civil War Campaign Medal No. 1 was issued to Maj. Gen. Charles F. Humphrey on May 26, 1909. 

The medal was originally established as a badge, because Congress would not approve a medal due to the costs involved. The War Department was authorized to create badges, so it did. This interest was due in large part to the fact that several senior military officers were veterans of the Civil War. Although some recipients may have worn some form of the ribbon, the monies necessary to mint and issue the medal were not appropriated by Congress until 1956 – 91 years after the war ended. It was this act that provided U.S. government purchase for the medal to all qualified veterans, whether they were on active or inactive duty.

In 1918, for those who had been cited for gallantry in action, the Silver Citation Star was authorized as a device to the medal. Only six Citation Stars were awarded. 

There is a direct relationship between U.S. campaign streamers and the medal that a campaign represents. The streamer represents the unit&#x27;s participation in a campaign and the medal represents an individual&#x27;s participation in that campaign (U.S. Army – some differences for the U.S. Navy). When a campaign is established, participating unit&#x27;s are authorized a streamer and each service member assigned to the unit during that same time is authorized the medal. Sometimes these medals are campaign medals, other times they are service medals, but that streamer/medal relationship normally remains. Units in the U.S. Army that trace their heritage and lineage to the Civil War are entitled to display a battle streamer for the Civil War on their flagpoles. This streamer is half blue and half gray, the color theme of the second ribbon design. The campaign lettering requires two distinct sets of streamers for each campaign, one set for each side.

Army National Guard units that previously traced their lineage to the Confederate Army were stripped of their Civil War battle streamers in 2023. The descendant units remain in service, but the Army National Guard no longer recognizes the lineage nor authorizes the streamers for campaigns against the U.S. Armed Forces.

==Regulations==
Army Regulation (AR) 600-8-22, Chapter V, Section III, paragraph 5–20 states the following - 

Civil War Campaign Medal This medal was established by War Department General Order 12, 1907. It is awarded for service between 15 April 1861 and 9 April 1865, or in Texas between 15 April 1861 and 20 August 1866.

Navy and Marine Corps Awards Manual (Rev. 1953), Part IV, Section 2, Paragraph 1 states the following - 

Civil War Campaign Medal This medal is issued to officers and enlisted personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps who served in the naval service during the Civil War, between 15 April 1861 and 9 April 1865. (Special Orders No. 81 and 82 of 27 June 1908.)

<doc id="753132" wikidata="Q775889" url="?curid=753132" title="Dynasty Warriors 4">
<text>is a 2003 hack and slash video game developed by Omega Force and published by Koei for the PlayStation 2. It is the fourth installment in the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series. An Xbox port followed later in the year as well as an enhanced port to personal computers in 2005 named Similar to other titles in the series, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; is based on the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; written by Luo Guanzhong. Set in the Three Kingdoms era of ancient China, the game depicts characters that are based on real-life figures as well as fictionalized versions of historical battles.

The gameplay features hundreds of soldiers fighting on battlefields of varying sizes. The player controls a single officer and can engage multiple enemies at once, with the aim to defeat the enemy&#x27;s general in order to win the battle. The main gameplay mode depicts the events of the historical novel with branching story paths that include alternate history scenarios for the available characters. Only nine characters are available at the start; playing through the story grants access to more characters. Additional modes include an edit mode to create unique characters, a versus mode for duels, and a challenge mode. 

&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; was commercially successful. The game shipped 1 million copies within 9 days of its initial release in Japan and eventually sold 2.2 million copies to become one of the best selling titles in Koei&#x27;s series of &quot;Warrior&quot; games. Critically &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; was well received; it has an average of 78 out of 100 on Metacritics reviews and 79% on Game Rankings. Reviews noted the similarity to previous games in the series and complimented the enjoyable gameplay. Critics were divided on whether the improvements from the previous title were sufficient, while the game&#x27;s English voice acting was universally panned. Two expansions, and were released for the PlayStation 2 that provided additional gameplay options and features.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; features hack and slash action gameplay from a third person perspective similar to previous titles in the series. One to two players can control an officer on a battlefield featuring hundreds of soldiers engaged in combat with a set time limit. Like other games in the genre, player characters use their unique weapons to defeat multiple enemies at once. &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; also provides an option to shoot arrows from a first-person perspective and to have bodyguard support during gameplay. Battles are won when the enemy general is defeated, either by the player or the player’s army, or a special preset condition is met. Conversely, if time expires or the player’s character or main general is defeated, the game ends in a loss. Characters are defeated when their health is depleted. Characters also have a special Musou gauge that when filled allows them to execute a special attack.

Nine characters are available at the start, with more accessible by completing campaigns or specific conditions in the story focused Musou Mode. Players can augment characters with items discovered during battles. Items include saddles that grant the character a mount to ride, orbs that add elemental damage to attacks, and special equipment that can raise combat statistics or provide special abilities. Characters, weapons, and bodyguards can gain experience from combat that increase their rank, which strengthens their combat statistics.

The morale system returns in &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;, and represents the balance of each side’s overall morale during a battle. Morale levels are influenced by actions that benefit a side’s army and tip the scale in their favor. New features include additional officers to control; an Edit Mode, which allows players to create up to four custom characters; and siege equipment that provides new obstacles and battlefield objectives. Siege equipment includes bridge layers, battering rams, and catapults. Players are also able to switch characters during a campaign, which focuses on a faction’s story rather than an individual’s. Another addition are duels during battles. Enemy officers can challenge the player’s character to a timed one-on-one duel. Winning the duel defeats the officer and raises morale, whereas running out of time results in a draw and the battle continues.

== Plot ==
=== Characters ===
Only three characters are initially available from each of the Three Kingdoms: Liu Bei and his two sworn brothers, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, from the Shu Kingdom; Cao Cao, Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan from the Wei Kingdom; and Sun Jian, his daughter Sun Shang Xiang, and Huang Gai from the Wu Kingdom. Additional characters in each kingdom become available after progressing through the Musou Mode of their respective faction.

Shu Kingdom characters include the generals Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, Wei Yan, Huang Zhong and Jiang Wei. Other Shu playable warriors are the strategists Zhuge Liang and Pang Tong as well as Zhuge Liang&#x27;s wife, Yue Ying, who is a new character to the series&#x27; roster. The Wei Kingdom includes Zhen Ji, the wife of Cao Pi, one of Cao Cao&#x27;s sons, as well as the generals Dian Wei, Xu Huang, Sima Yi, Zhang Liao, Xu Zhu, and Zhang He. The new Wei character is Cao Cao&#x27;s cousin, Cao Ren. The Wu Kingdom includes two of Sun Jian&#x27;s sons, Sun Ce and Sun Quan, as well as Sun Ce&#x27;s wife, Da Qiao, and her younger sister, Xiao Qiao. Other Wu playable characters include the generals Zhou Yu, Lu Meng, Gan Ning, Taishi Ci, Lu Xun, and Zhou Tai, who joins the playable roster this game.

The roster also includes several figures who featured prominently in various parts of the story grouped as an &quot;Other&quot; faction. The corrupt warlord Dong Zhuo as well as his courtesan Diao Chan and his traitorous general Lu Bu are accessible after progressing further through the story. Yuan Shao, the allied forces general and Cao Cao&#x27;s rival, becomes available after completing the Wei campaign. The Nanman leaders Meng Huo and Zhu Rong first appear during the Shu or Wu campaigns and become accessible after they are defeated in a duel. After completing several different campaigns, the rebellious Yellow Turban leader Zhang Jiao becomes playable. Many other characters important to key events in the story appear as non-player characters during battles throughout the game (e.g., Cao Pi, Guan Ping, and Ling Tong).

=== Story ===
Based on the book &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; is set in Ancient China during the Three Kingdoms era. The plot unfolds via the game&#x27;s Musou Mode and features branching paths that change based on player choices. Also included are special tales that are accessible by completing specific conditions during certain battles. Each faction&#x27;s story includes events that are interwoven with the story of the others. Though the outcomes vary based on the player&#x27;s actions, each path highlights the historical battles from the respective faction&#x27;s perspective. Many of the paths begin at the Yellow Turban Rebellion, where the Han dynasty and Allied forces defeat Zhang Jiao and his religious sect, the Way of Peace. Soon after the rebellion, the warlord Dong Zhuo siezes control of the Imperial Court with the help of the fierce warrior Lu Bu and the courtesan Diao Chan. In response, the nobleman Yuan Shao rallies a group of allied forces against Dong Zhuo&#x27;s forces. They successfully drove Dong Zhuo&#x27;s armies back from Si Shui Gate and Hulao Gate, culminating in a battle at the capital Luoyang. Afterward, the forces split and three generals begin to form their own kingdoms: Shu Kingdom led by Liu Bei, Wei Kingdom led by Cao Cao, and Wu Kingdom led Sun Jian.

During the Shu story, Liu Bei and his two sworn brothers, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, fight to restore the Han Dynasty. After Dong Zhuo&#x27;s defeat, Liu Bei searchs for a place to settle his followers while clashing with the Wei Kingdom&#x27;s leader, Cao Cao, who has become the ruler of Northen China. As the game progresses, Liu Bei recruits others, like the warriors Zhao Yun and Ma Chao as well as the strategist Zhuge Liang, to strengthen his group. He eventually allies with the Wu Kingdom, led at the time by one of Sun Jian&#x27;s son (Sun Quan), to fight Cao Cao, which leads to a joint effort at the Battle of Chi Bi. After the battle, Lui Bei attacks the Wu Kingdom, and during the campaign, defeats the Nanman from Southern China. The Shu Kingdom eventually defeats Wu at the Battle of Yi Ling. The Shu Kingdom&#x27;s story concludes at the Battle of Wu Zhang Plains, where they overcome the remaining Wei forces, led by Sima Yi, Cao Cao&#x27;s strategist. After defeating the major factions, Liu Bei unites China under the Shu Han Kingdom.

The Wei scenario features similar events from the perspective of their leader Cao Cao, who focuses on uniting China after Dong Zhuo&#x27;s defeat. During a rebellion in Wan Castle, Cao Cao escapes with help of his guard Dian Wei. Cao Cao then formed an alliance with Liu Bei to defeat Lu Bu, gaining several officers in the process. Afterward, he destroys Yuan Shao&#x27;s army at the Battle of Guan Du. Following his victories, Cao Cao begins a campaign against Liu Bei, pursuing him across several territories in China. As a result, Lui Bei joins forces with the Wu Kingdom against Cao Cao, culminating in the Battle of Chi Bi. However, the Wei forces thwart the joint alliance&#x27;s strategies. Cao Cao continues advancing on the Shu and Wu forces until they are completely defeated, unifying China under the Wei Kingdom.

Similar to the other Kingdoms, the Wu story begins with the events of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Dong Zhuo&#x27;s coup. After Dong Zhuo&#x27;s defeat, he escapes to Luoyang where Sun Jian attacks him and finds the Imperial Seal in the process. Upon returning home, Sun Jian finds out other generals have taken over Jing Province and the Wu Territory. With the help of his children, Sun Jian defeats the various generals and eventually regains the Wu Territory and finds new generals to expands his army. Seeing Cao Cao&#x27;s growing influence, the Wu Kingdom allies with the Shu Kingdom at the Battle of Chi Bi, successfully halting Cao Cao&#x27;s momentum. Following the battle, the three Kingdoms begin to fight each other, and the Sun family lead campaigns against the Shu Kingdom to outwit their strategist, Zhuge Liang. After defeating the Nanman tribe, the Wu Kingdom conquers Shu at the Battle of Yi Ling. Turning their attention back to the Wei Kingdom, the Sun family defeats them at several locations, culminating at the Battle of Xu Chang and successfully unifying China.

The game also includes stories that depict alternate histories for characters outside the main three Kingdoms. Yuan Shao&#x27;s story has him successfully defeating his rival Cao Cao after quelling the Yellow Turban rebellion and Dong Zhuo&#x27;s coup. After crushing the Wei forces at the Battle of Guan Du, Yuan Shao focuses on defeating Liu Bei and Sun Jian. He fights two campaigns against them, defeating Sun Jian at He Fei and Liu Bei in Xia Pi. The Nanman scenario depicts them successfully repelling the Shu Kingdom after Dong Zhuo&#x27;s coup. Infuriated at the Shu invasion, King Meng Huo resolves to defeat them at his wife&#x27;s, Zhu Rong, encouragement. Meng Huo drives them into the Kingdom of Wu, which he decides to conquer, killing the Sun family in the process. He successfully continues his campaign into the Wei Kingdom and eventually marches on the Shu capital to defeat the last of its generals. The story for Lu Bu details his victories at the Battles of Si Shui Gate and Hu Lao Gate where he fights off invaders for Dong Zhuo. Afterward, Lu Bu revolts in Wan Castle and executes Dong Zhuo to seize control of his army. He then wages war against Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian and defeats them to take over China. Dong Zhuo&#x27;s scenario also depicts his successes against the coalition led by Yuan Shao at Si Shui Gate and Hu Lao Gate. After his victory, Dong Zhuo follows Sun Jian, who took the Imperial Seal when he fled the capital. He then launches campaigns to destroy the rest of the alliance forces: Cao Cao and Liu Bei. After successfully eliminating the opposition, Dong Zhuo is betrayed by Lu Bu. He stops Lu Bu&#x27;s rebellion and marches into the capital to complete his take over of China. Zhang Jiao&#x27;s story describes the Yellow Turbans&#x27; rise to power. Upon learning of the Han army&#x27;s intention, Zhang Jiao leads the Yellow Turbans in a series of campaigns to defeat Liu Bei, Sun Jian, and Cao Cao. In its last effort, the Han send He Jin with a coalition of numerous generals to battle the Yellow Turbans. Zhang Jiao vanquishes the last of the Han and unifies China.

== Development ==
&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; was developed by Koei&#x27;s Omega Force team with Akihiro Suzuki directing. The team also included Tomohiko Sho. Suzuki noted that the large number of characters who appeared in different periods of the story made it difficult to create individual stories. They instead opted for stories focused on the era&#x27;s factions. The developers took into account feedback from &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot;, which included requests for individual stories for characters like Lu Bu and Diao Chan. Since development of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; had already begun, however, the team realized that adding in all the requested content would be very time consuming. They instead decided to create &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends&quot; and release it as a secondary disc to provide fans with the content they requested at a discounted price. The game&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Cross Colors&quot;, was performed by Japanese pop singer Yuki Koyanagi. Koyanagi composed the song and wrote the lyrics with Kazuhiro Hara. The music was arranged by TATOO. Koei announced her involvement about a month before &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;″s Japanese release. Warner Music Japan released the song on March 5, 2003 as part of the single &quot;On the Radio&quot;. 

=== Release and ports ===
&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; was first announced in December 2002; Koei launched a teaser webpage that featured the game&#x27;s Japanese logo. Soon after, the company announced that the game would be released in Japan in February 2003. Koei continued to update the &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; webpage with information throughout December. Updates included that the game would be exclusive to the PlayStation 2, the siege-aspect of battles, reactionary artificial intelligence, new characters and stages, and the North American region&#x27;s release window. After the North American release, Koei announced in April 2003 that &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; would be released in Europe on June 27, 2003. Following &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;″s commercial success, Sony Computer Entertainment America added it to their Greatest Hits lineup, reducing the list price down to $19.99. The game was included along with &quot;Dynasty Warriors 2&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot; and their respective expansions in a Japanese exclusive five-disc compilation set titled . The set, which was released in 2006, also included a data disc with game saves.

In June 2003, Koei&#x27;s vice president of sales and marketing, Amos Ip, announced that they were porting the game to the Xbox console to broaden their audience. While the PlayStation 2 version featured only monaural and stereo sound, the Xbox release included support for 5.1 surround sound. Microsoft later announced in 2006 that &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; was among the titles that would be backwards compatible with the Xbox 360 console, which allowed the game to be played in high-definition video.

Koei announced in 2005 that it would showcase &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4 PC&quot; at E3, which was later revealed to be &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper&quot;. The game is a port of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; to computers running Windows 2000/Windows XP. &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper&quot; features improved graphics, higher resolution options, more characters onscreen, improved draw distance, optional Japanese dialogue, and improved enemy AI. The additional content from &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends&quot; was not included. Similar to the original game, Koei set up a website to promote the port and provide updates. In addition to hardware requirements, the website listed graphics card that had been confirmed to work with the game as well as a program to check whether a user&#x27;s system specifications meet the hardware requirements. The game was originally slated to be released on March 30, 2005. However, Koei delayed the release by two days due to &quot;various circumstances&quot;. Later in October 2005, the company publicized that &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper&quot; would be released in Europe on December 9 of that year.

== Reception ==
&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; was commercially and overall critically successful. Previews for the game before its release expressed anticipation. &quot;Game Informer&quot; staff referred to the real-time siege equipment and one-on-one battles between officers as &quot;tantalizing&quot;. &quot;GameSpot UK&quot;″s Richardo Torres praised the graphical improvements from its predecessor as well as the new gameplay elements and called &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; a &quot;promising entry in the franchise.&quot; Randy Nelson of &quot;PlayStation 2 Magazine&quot; noted that the game would address fan&#x27;s requests and that the updates would deepen the series&#x27; gameplay.

Soon after its Japanese release, &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; magazine reported that &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; had sold 723,127 units in 4 days. Koei announced that it had shipped 1 million copies in 9 days. This was Koei&#x27;s second title to reach this milestone; its first title, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot;, took a year to ship 1 million units. In the United Kingdom, the game debuted on the UK All Formats Game Chart at number 13 while it was still exclusively on the PlayStation 2. In reviewing the game, IGN&#x27;s Jeremy Dunham anticipated that &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; would &quot;shatter sales records&quot;. The game eventually sold 2.2 million copies and was Koei&#x27;s best selling title in the &quot;Warriors&quot; series until 2020&#x27;s &quot;Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity&quot;.

Critics noted that &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; had not changed much from its predecessor but is still an entertaining game. Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone described it as &quot;a very welcome familiar face even for long-time fans of the series&quot; and noted that many series do not succeed without making &quot;radical changes&quot; to sequels. &quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewer Justin Leeper expressed amazement at the lack of innovation and improvement in &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;. Regardless, he praised the game&#x27;s replay value and called some of the new gameplay additions and improvements &quot;cool&quot;. Conversely, Dunham commented that Koei made many changes to the sequel that addressed graphical and character balancing issues from &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3&quot;. He praised the visuals, the enhanced enemy AI, the combat&#x27;s combo system, and the diversity in the stages. Dunham, however, expressed disappointment in the siege engine, commenting that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its potential.&quot; Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot noted that Koei walked a &quot;fine line between updating a venerable franchise with valuable new features and simply milking a cash cow.&quot; He further stated that new and fervent fans will enjoy &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;, but casual players are unlikely to purchase a sequel that is so similar to past titles they&#x27;ve already played. &quot;PlayStation 2 Magazine&quot;″s Eric Bratcher praised the additions and improvements, calling it the &quot;best &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; game yet.&quot; However, he criticized some issues that had persisted from the previous games such as poor camera angles, short draw distances and a lack of variety in the game objectives. In her column on gaming website Dengeki Online, Japanese actress Ayana praised the variety in the game&#x27;s Edit Mode. While reflecting on the series, she commented that &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; had the best costumes, noting that although the costumes changed only slightly between titles she enjoyed following the changes.

The gameplay was frequently lauded. Leeper described the game as easy to control and the combat as a &quot;tension reliever&quot;. Shoemaker described the &quot;superhuman&quot; capabilities of the characters as &quot;amusing&quot; and the new changes as positive although minor. A year after its release, Ivan Sulic of IGN UK ranked &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; the 5th best co-operative game on the PlayStation 2. He cited the game&#x27;s simple yet appealing design and described it as a &quot;refined&quot; action game for fans of battles. The Xbox port received a similar reception. Readers of &quot;Famitsu Xbox&quot; ranked it the 5th most anticipated game in Japan around its release. Zacarias praised the number of modes available to players and described the gameplay as easy to pick up and &quot;addictively fun&quot;. He noted that the graphics were not the best on the Xbox console but still complimented them as well as the game&#x27;s steady framerate during battles with many soldiers on the screen. &quot;Famitsu Xbox&quot;″s four reviewers described the gameplay as enjoyable, with two of them labeling &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; as one of the best picks of October 2003. Hirohito Aizawa noted that aside from surround sound support and slightly improved graphics, the Xbox port did not include new features over the PlayStation 2 version. Rolling Uchisawa praised the alternate history aspect and the multiple modes of play. Tagawa Rameo complimented the familarity from previous titles in the series but commented that the game might be difficult for new players and criticized the loading times.

Criticism focused on the game&#x27;s audio components. Shoemaker called the voice acting &quot;campy&quot; and compared it a &quot;dubbed kung fu movie&quot;. Zacarias described the heavy metal-inspired soundtrack as outdated and mismatched to the ancient Chinese setting. He called the English voice acting &quot;downright horrible&quot; and stated that it made the game&#x27;s dramatic dialog unintentionally humorous and &quot;lame&quot;. Dunham echoed similar comments, calling the English voices &quot;terrible&quot; and &quot;bordering on average&quot; at best. He also expressed disappointment at the lack of the Japanese language option as well as the lack of high-end audio support on the PlayStation 2. Conversely, Leeper described the musical score as &quot;well done&quot; despite the hair metal aspects at times.

== Expansions ==
&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; was followed by two expansions. The first was &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4 Xtreme Legends&quot;, which added new gameplay options and modes. The second expansion, &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires&quot;, added strategy and diplomacy to the original.

=== &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends&quot; ===
&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends&quot; is a stand-alone expansion to &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; developed by Omega Force and published by Koei for the PlayStation 2. The expansion adds two levels of difficulty, two additional modes of play, and new weapons, stages, and items. The first new mode, &quot;Xtreme Mode&quot;, features randomly generated stages and an in-game shop to purchase items. The &quot;Legends Mode&quot; provides unique stages and storylines for each of the 42 playable characters. &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; allows players to import their save data from the original game and can be played without the &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; disc. Players are also able to use the original disc to access the stages from the original &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; and play them with the new features.

Koei announced the North American release in August 2003. Though originally expected to be released on October 4, 2003, the release was pushed back to November. To promote the game, Koei released a television ad in Japan and launched a website. The website, which launched on September 13, 2003, provided news and downloadable content related to the expansion. The website&#x27;s webmaster was Ben Stockwell. On October 13, 2003, Koei announced that &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; had gone gold and would ship to North American retailers on November 4, 2003. Following shipping, it was released in game stores a few days later on November 7, 2003. Similar to &quot;Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends&quot;, this expansion&#x27;s list price was lower than the typical PlayStation 2 games price. 

&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends&quot; was generally well received critically with an average of 72 out of 100 on Metacritics reviews. Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot noted that despite the additions, it was fundamentally very similar to the original game and is targeted at hardcore fans that already own &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; rather than new players. &quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewer Matthew Kato also noted the similarity but commented that the new additions are worth the discounted price. Writing for &quot;Playstation 2 Magazine&quot;, Dunham summarized &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; as &quot;very good&quot; and labeled it as a Bronze &quot;PSM Must Buy&quot; game. However, he recommended the game only for &quot;feverishly devoted&quot; fans or those new to the series.

=== &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires&quot; ===
&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires&quot; is the second expansion of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;, released exclusively for the PlayStation 2. Omega Force developed the &quot;Empires&quot; expansion based on player feedback. Fans of Koei&#x27;s simulation series &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; requested to play a game that combined the domestic policy tactics of the series with the combat from &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;. Because combining the two genres was difficult, the team used a more simplified system than what is in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. They also changed the combat&#x27;s focus from charging an enemy general to pushing forward a front line. The main feature of the expansion is a new Empire Mode, which tasks players with uniting regions of China through choosing diplomatic strategies that influence events in battles. Other additions include an expanded Edit Mode, updated stages, and an archive with artwork, movies and other game elements. Similar to the previous expansion, players can import their save data from the original game or &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot;.

The expansion was announced in Japan in January 2004. Focus was given to the strategy aspect along with portions carried over from &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot;. A March Japanese release date was also announced, which coincided with the end of Koei&#x27;s 2003 financial year. Ahead of its release on March 18, 2004, Koei revealed that it would release several editions of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires&quot; in Japan: a standalone expansion, a premium pack that includes the &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; expansion, and a super premium pack comprising both expansions and the original game. &quot;Empires&quot; sold 187,474 units within two weeks of its Japanese release and was the 8th best-selling game the week of March 29, 2004. The next month, Ip publicized that Koei would showcase &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires&quot; at E3 in anticipation of a North American release. After E3 2004, the company launched a promotional website similar to the other &quot;Dynasty Warriors 4&quot; titles. On August 4, 2004, Koei announced that the game had gone gold and would ship to North American retailers at the end of the month. 

&quot;Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires&quot; was overall well received critically and has an average of 71 out of 100 on Metacritics reviews. In reviewing the expansion, Shoemaker commented that while the presentation had &quot;barely changed&quot;, the combination of high-level strategy and on-the-battlefield combat works well and brought &quot;much-needed depth to the aging&quot; series. He further state that the title could reach a new audience outside the series&#x27; hardcore fans. Patrick Garratt of Eurogamer criticized the game&#x27;s strategy and action combination, stating that it only amounts to an average game that &quot;becomes repetitive too quickly.&quot; IGN&#x27;s Ed Lewis called the strategy aspect of the gameplay an &quot;interesting twist&quot; and noted that the game would&#x27;ve benefited from a larger focus on the strategy portions. Both Garratt and Lewis compared the strategy elements to the board game &quot;Risk&quot;.

<doc id="753133" wikidata="Q3294510" url="?curid=753133" title="Perdido River">
<text>The Perdido River, also historically known as Rio Perdido or by its native name of Cassaba, is a river in the U.S. states of Alabama and Florida; the Perdido, a designated Outstanding Florida Waters river, forms part of the boundary between the two states along nearly its entire length and drains into the Gulf of Mexico. During the early 19th century it played a central role in a series of rotating boundary changes and disputes among France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States.

It rises in southwestern Alabama in Escambia County approximately northwest of Atmore. It flows south approximately to latitude 31°N, south of which it forms the remainder of the Alabama/Florida border. It flows generally east-southeast in a winding course and enters the north end of Perdido Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, approximately west of Pensacola.

The word &quot;perdido&quot; is Spanish for &quot;lost&quot;.

==History==
From 1682 to 1763, the Perdido formed the boundary between the French colony of Louisiana and the Spanish colony of Florida. Following the British victory over the French in the French and Indian War, Great Britain received the French colonial territory between the Mississippi River and the Perdido River, as well as the Spanish colony of Florida, while Spain received the formerly French territory west of the Mississippi, plus the city of New Orleans. The British divided their newly acquired colony into West Florida and East Florida at the Apalachicola River (whose main tributary, the Chattahoochee River, forms a large portion of the present boundary between Alabama and Georgia, and a small part of the Florida/Georgia boundary).

Twenty years later, as part of the Treaty of Paris, Britain returned all of Florida to Spain, at which point Spain controlled the entire coast of the Gulf of Mexico. (Spain maintained the West and East Florida colonial designations that the British had established.)

In 1800, as part of the Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain returned the Louisiana colony to France, retaining control of the lands east of the Mississippi River (except New Orleans). In 1803, France sold Louisiana (New France) to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase.

A boundary dispute erupted between the U.S. and Spain, with the U.S. claiming the land west of the Perdido River as part of the original Louisiana (New France) colony, whereas the Spanish claimed that only the portion of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River had been returned to France. The Gulf coast south of 31 degrees latitude, between the Mississippi and Perdido rivers, remained disputed between the two nations. In 1810, the Republic of West Florida successfully declared its independence from a weakened Spain. Ninety days later, U.S. military forces entered its capital (St. Francisville, Louisiana) and effectively annexed the short-lived nation. However, this action did not extend all the way to the Perdido River.

During the War of 1812 (1812–15), U.S. military forces entered Mobile to enforce the surrender of the Spanish officials there. A year or so later, U.S. garrisons were defending Gulf coast forts against British naval attacks and attempting to stop the British Army from capturing New Orleans. This coastal area (today&#x27;s Mississippi and Alabama Gulf coasts), the land west of the Perdido River, was incorporated into the Mississippi Territory by the United States. In 1817 the Alabama Territory was carved out of the eastern half of the Mississippi Territory.

The dispute with Spain was finally resolved in 1819 with the Adams-Onís Treaty, in which Spain ceded all of Florida to the United States. The treaty wasn&#x27;t ratified by the Spanish government until a couple of years later. In 1822 the Florida Territory was established, with the Perdido River as the (coastal) boundary between it and the new state of Alabama.

<doc id="753143" wikidata="Q116316" url="?curid=753143" title="Trickle-down fashion">
<text>Trickle-down fashion is a model of product adoption in marketing that affects many consumer goods and services.

It states that fashion flows vertically from the upper classes to the lower classes within society, each social class influenced by a higher social class. Two conflicting principles drive this diffusion dynamic. Lesser social groups seek to establish new status claims by adopting the fashions of higher social groups in imitation, whilst higher social groups respond by adopting new fashions to differentiate themselves. This provokes an endless cycle of change, driving fashion forward in a continual process of innovation.

Due to this dynamic, initially, a product may be so expensive that only the wealthy can afford it. Over time, however, the price will fall until it is inexpensive enough for the general public to purchase.

== History and evolution of the term ==
The trickle down theory has been modified greatly from the Veblen–Jhering model, produced in the end of the 19th century, to date. However, it provides an overall theory of how novelty is first introduced then disseminated throughout society.

=== Von Jhering ===
The German jurist Rudolf von Jhering is probably the first author who developed a full theory of cultural diffusion from the upper classes to the lower classes, applied to fashion, in his book (second volume, 1883). The French sociologist Émile Durkheim summarizes Von Jhering&#x27;s theory: &quot;[According to this author, fashion] is the result of the need for superior classes to distinguish themselves on the outside from the inferior classes. Because on one side the latter constantly tend to imitate the former, fashion spreads in society by means of contagion. But, on the other side, because it lost all its value once it is adopted by everybody, it is condemned by its very nature to renew itself continuously&quot;.

=== Simmel ===
Georg Simmel described the trickle-down theory of fashion in his 1904 article. He does not cite von Jhering.

=== Veblen ===
The theory of conspicuous consumption was introduced by Thorstein Veblen in his book The Theory of the Leisure Class. The oldest theory of distribution, it poses that people spend money on obtaining luxury goods and services to give an indication of their wealth to other members of society. He highlights society&#x27;s endless quest for novelty maintaining that &#x27;elegance&#x27; or elaborateness of dress, and new styles, which are both indicative of expense, are the main drivers of fashion change. Each social class imitates the consumption behaviour of the class above it in order to enhance their social status.

When applied to fashion, this theory states that when the lowest social class, or simply a perceived lower social class, adopts the fashion, it is no longer desirable to the leaders in the highest social class. The theory has been associated with later trickle-down theories as importantly, Veblen also observed that the upper classes found more extravagant ways of exercising conspicuous consumption in order to differentiate themselves from the class imitating their original consumption behaviour.

=== Fallers ===
Lloyd A. Fallers of the East African Institute of Social Research put forth this hypothesis in 1954:
:The trickle effect is a mechanism for maintaining the motivation to strive for social success, and hence for maintaining efficiency of performance in occupational roles, in a system in which differential success is possible for only a few. Status-symbolic consumption goods trickle down, thus giving the &quot;illusion&quot; of success to those who fail to achieve &quot;differential&quot; success in the opportunity and status pyramid. From this point of view the trickle effect becomes a &quot;treadmill&quot;.

In a society experiencing social and economic progress, &quot;...the entire population has been upwardly mobile. From this point of view, the status-symbolic goods and services do not &#x27;trickle down&#x27; but rather remain in fixed positions; the population moves up through the hierarchy of status-symbolic consumption patterns.&quot;

=== McCracken ===
In his book &quot;Culture and Consumption&quot; (1990), Grant McCracken aims to rehabilitate the trickle-down theory by expanding it for modern day application and use in the study of contemporary fashion. He adapts the theory to include groups that assume superordinate and subordinate roles in the modern trickle-down process but are not necessarily defined in terms of social strata. He includes other demographics such as gender, age and ethnicity. McCracken also acknowledges that the trickle down effect does not necessitate the appropriation of style but that the group can selectively borrow aspects of fashion, maintaining some of its own qualities. He also accounts for the influence of distribution, investors and location in relation to the trickle-down effect.

== The trickle-down theory in fashion ==

The trickle-down theory has long been identified as a central principle of explanation for the historical study of fashion and its sociological implications.

When applied to fashion, the theory states that a style is first offered and adopted by the top strata of society and gradually becomes accepted by subordinate groups. This is because fashion is considered a vehicle of conspicuous consumption and upward mobility within society and allowed people to express their individuality whilst maintaining the security of conformity with other members of their social stratum. When a lower social class, or a class simply perceived to be subordinate, adopt the fashion, it is rejected by the superordinate social class as it is no longer desirable, and another fashion assumed.

The trickle-down theory offers a straightforward way of predicting fashion diffusion. If a lesser social group begins to appropriate superordinate fashion by wearing cheaper versions of styles, the superordinate group will likely differentiate themselves by assuming a new trend, leading to further acts of appropriation by the subordinate group.

A trickle-down theory that supplies a cultural context can predict not only the fact that the fashion change will take place but also the direction and properties of the change.

The affordability aspect of the trickle-down theory is still highly applicable to the contemporary fashion industry. This can be seen, for example, when looking at the movement of a trend from the catwalk to the high street. When a catwalk trend is assumed by the affluent at a high price, comparable pieces may be released by high street stores at a cheaper price to meet the demand of the perceived lower classes, who seek to imitate the fashion behavior of the affluent.

Furthermore, it has been claimed that in most cases the diffusion of trends follows a trickle-down movement, even when at a quick glance they seem to be emerging from the street (Bubble-up model). Often, an innovation that seems to originate from the fringes of society does not become a trend until it is adopted by some form of &quot;elite&quot; within a society. In other words, a single product can be originated from the streets, but the process that turns its adoption into a trend requires some form of elite to leverage the masses, hence it is nothing but a trickle-down in disguise. 

Basically, in a shorter description who started the trend in the upper class and how they influenced others to use/wear/carry on the trend down to the lower class.

== Criticisms ==
Whilst the theory has received attention due to its pioneering nature, conceptual development and its use in subsequent and related explanations of fashion diffusion and change, it faces many criticisms.

In a revision of the theory, McCracken states that Simmel does not explain the trickle down effect in its full detail and complexity, failing to account for the fact that only the lowest and highest-ranking groups in society have a single motive for their consumer behaviour. The lowest-ranking group have no lower group from which they must differentiate themselves so act solely in imitation whilst the highest-ranking group acts only to differentiate themselves as they have no higher-ranking social group to imitate. All intermediate groups, however, may have a dual motive. They may act either in imitation, in differentiation or both.

He also holds that whilst the theory may have been an accurate representation of fashion at the turn of the 19th century, when Simmel and Veblen were writing, the Simmel–Veblen model has little place in today&#x27;s society. Firstly, the modern social and marketing environment is different to the class system that existed before.

This is because elite fashion has largely been replaced by mass fashion, which does not involve the same dynamic of imitation and differentiation observed by the trickle-down effect. The power of fashion depends on communication; the more fashion information is communicated, the more human fashion behaviour is impacted. Fashion information in contemporary society is democratised; it is no longer solely the upper class that has the ability to affect fashion behaviour, but a range of social classes and groups. Mass media exposure through televised fashion information, fashion magazines and editorials have allowed simultaneous adoption of new styles at all levels of society.

It is generally accepted among fashion researchers that fashions propagate more across social classes rather than trickle down (or up) as consumers tend to be more influenced by opinion leaders within their own social groups. As a result, each social group has its own fashion innovators who determine fashion trends.

Another criticism is that fashion is innately disorderly and complex. Trying to assign order to a complex phenomenon that usually consists of a range of factors including imitation and differentiation, adoptions and rejects all in relation to an individual&#x27;s social surroundings has restricted the theory.

<doc id="753151" wikidata="Q7193920" url="?curid=753151" title="Pilgrim (brig)">
<text>Pilgrim was an early 19th century American sailing brig. She was immortalized by one of her sailors Richard Henry Dana Jr., who wrote the classic account &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; about a 1834–1835 voyage between Massachusetts and California to trade for hides. &quot;Pilgrim&quot; caught fire and sank at sea in 1856.

==Construction and trading==
&quot;Pilgrim&quot; was a brig-rigged sailing vessel built in 1825 by Sprague &amp; James at Medford, Massachusetts for Joshua Blake, Francis Stanton and George Hallett, and later sold to Bryant &amp; Sturgis of Boston. She measured 180.5 tons burthen, had a length of and a beam of .

Richard Henry Dana Jr., a Harvard College undergraduate suffering from the effects of measles, joined the crew in 1834 as an ordinary sailor for a voyage from Boston, Massachusetts via Cape Horn to California to trade for hides from the ranches around the Franciscan missions. That voyage is covered in the first part of his classic memoire &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;.

&quot;Pilgrim&quot; sank off the North Carolina coast after a fire at sea in 1856.

===Crew===
As described by Dana, in addition to six to eight common sailors, the ship&#x27;s complement included three officers: the Captain, the First Mate and the Second Mate. The second mate commanded the starboard watch but while an officer was socially isolated, being neither truly an officer or a crewman. This was probably due to the size of the ship; on larger vessels with more crew, the Second Mate was clearly an officer, but on the &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, the Captain and First Mate ate together and the Second Mate had to make do with their leftovers. Besides the captain, there were four specialist crewmembers who were not part of any watch: the steward, cook, carpenter and sailmaker.

==Replica==

A replica of the vessel was based in Dana Point, California, the site of some of Dana&#x27;s adventures. This replica began as a 3-masted schooner (also called a &quot;tern&quot; schooner in North America) built in 1945 for the Baltic trade in Denmark. In 1975, &quot;Pilgrim&quot; was converted to a brig in Setúbal, Portugal. She was used as a floating classroom with the Ocean Institute in Dana Point, California, and she set sail every summer on a tour of Southern California with a volunteer crew. The ship was used in &quot;Amistad&quot;, a film directed by Steven Spielberg. &quot;Pilgrim&quot; also played the notorious &quot;Ghost Galleon&quot; in &quot;Power Rangers: Turbo&quot;.

On March 29, 2020, the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; reported that the ship had sunk. The ship began to heel starboard in its dock on March 29, and the decision was made to demolish it.

<text>Anthony Henderson (born June 17, 1973), better known as Krayzie Bone, is an American rapper. He is a member of the rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.

== Career ==

=== Solo ===
After finding success with Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Krayzie Bone recorded his solo debut, &quot;Thug Mentality 1999&quot;, in 1999. The album was released as a double disc set, featuring a large selection of guest appearances, including Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Mo Thugs, Mariah Carey, ThugLine, The Marley Brothers, Big Pun, Fat Joe, Cuban Link, Gangsta Boo, E-40, 8 Ball &amp; MJG, Kurupt, Naughty By Nature and Snoop Dogg. The album was largely produced by multi instrumentalist Romeo Antonio and was certified platinum by the RIAA.

In 2001, Krayzie Bone released &quot;Thug On Da Line&quot;, which received generally positive reviews from music critics and went gold.

In 2005 Krayzie Bone was featured in the song &quot;Ridin&#x27;&quot; by Chamillionaire. &quot;Ridin&#x27;&quot; was awarded &quot;Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group&quot; at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best Rap Song. It became number one in December on the Piczo Chart 3 months after its physical release. The song also topped the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart when it was released there. The song ranked #3 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Songs of 2006&quot; and #91 on VH1&#x27;s
&quot;100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop&quot;. It was the best selling ringtone in 2006, with 3.2 million sales, certified by the RIAA as the first multi-platinum Mastertone artist in history. It was also awarded the last Best Rap Video at the MTV Video Music Awards, which was awarded in 2006.

During an April 2014 press conference, Krayzie Bone announced that the first installment of the &quot;Chasing the Devil&quot; trilogy album would be released July 22, 2014 by RBC Records. However, it was pushed back and ultimately released on November 20, 2015.

=== Business ===
Aside from music, Krayzie Bone has since then ventured into the business world. He was a founding member of Mo Thugs Family, a collective of Cleveland-based rap and Hip-Hop musical acts. He broke apart from the group in 1999 to form ThugLine Records, or TL. He had administrated the label to fellow Bone Thugs member Wish Bone as its president and co-CEO. The group has presently reunited and continue to tour as a whole. In many videos he can be spotted wearing a chain that says TL. In 2010, the name ThugLine Records was changed to The Life Entertainment. In order to reach out to more artists and identify the best talent for the label, Conquer The Industry was developed as an internet channel to help up and coming music artists break into the music industry. As a part of his entrepreneurial drive, Krayzie Bone launched a clothing and accessory line named &quot;TL Apparel&quot; which is a direct tie to his music. Many of his fans support his clothing line as they joined him in the grand opening of the store in Los Angeles. 
In 2018 Krayzie Bone signed a deal to distribute his digital media company,&quot;Krayzie Bone Media&quot; with The Digital Soapbox Network. His first show &quot;Quick Fix&quot;-The Afterhours was his first project with the network.

=== Verzuz and aftermath ===
Most recently, Krayzie Bone has found renewed public interest after Bone Thugs-n-Harmony battled long time rivals Three Six Mafia in one of the more notable Verzuz showdowns. With his name back in the spotlight, Krayzie Bone has seized this opportunity to start the &quot;Spread the Love&quot; foundation, a venture in which investments are used to help the youth excel in music and arts within the Cleveland community. On the music side of things, Krayzie Bone teamed up with Fatlip (of The Pharcyde) to assist on the lead single, &quot;Dust in the Wind,&quot; from the album &quot;Sccit &amp; Siavash The Grouch Present… Torpor&quot;. The single dropped on February 18, 2022 and marks the first time a member of Bone Thugs collaborated with a member of The Pharcyde.

==Personal life==
Henderson comes from a fourth generation family of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and as such does not celebrate Christmas. He believes many rappers are unintentionally following the agenda of the Illuminati.

On September 24, 2023, Krayzie Bone was admitted to a hospital in Los Angeles after coughing up blood in his sleep, what was later attributed to sarcoidosis. Doctors were unsuccessful in an emergency surgery. On September 26, he was sedated due to a main artery in his lung leaking. However, on October 3, he announced he had recovered from the ailment.

<text>Mona Jane Van Duyn (May 9, 1921 – December 2, 2004) was an American poet. She was appointed United States Poet Laureate in 1992.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Van Duyn was born May 9, 1921, in Waterloo, Iowa. She grew up in the small town of Eldora (pop. 3,200) where she read voraciously in the town library and wrote poems secretly in notebooks from her grade school years to her high school years. Van Duyn earned a B.A. from Iowa State Teachers College in 1942, and an M.A. from the State University of Iowa in 1943, the year she married Jarvis Thurston. She and Thurston studied in the Ph.D. program at Iowa. In 1946 she was hired as an instructor at the University of Louisville when her husband became an assistant professor there. Together they began &quot;Perspective: A Quarterly of Literature and the Arts&quot; in 1947, which she edited for the next twenty years. They shifted that journal to Washington University in St. Louis when they moved there in 1950.

===Academic career===

In St. Louis, Van Duyn taught English from 1950 to 1967 at Washington University. Thurston became chair of the Washington University Department of English, and Van Duyn and Thurston drew to St. Louis and presided over what would become a unique literary circle of creative writers and critics. (It included poet Howard Nemerov, novelist and critic William Gass, novelist Stanley Elkin, poets Donald Finkel and John Morris, critic Richard Stang, authors Wayne Fields and Naomi Lebowitz, and others.) Continuing to edit &quot;Perspective&quot; until it ceased publication in 1975, they are recognized for their role in fostering literary talent nationwide and for publishing early works by Anthony Hecht, W. S. Merwin, Douglas Woolf, and many others. 
Van Duyn was a friend of poet James Merrill and instrumental in securing his papers for the Washington University Special Collections in the mid-1960s. She was a lecturer in the University College of Washington University in St. Louis until her retirement in 1990. In 1983, a year after she had published her fifth book of poems, she was named adjunct professor in the English Department and became the &quot;Visiting Hurst Professor&quot; in 1987, the year she was invited to be a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.

===Career as a poet===

Van Duyn won every major U.S. prize for poetry, including the National Book Award (1971) for &quot;To See, To Take&quot;, the Bollingen Prize (1971), the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize (1989), and the Pulitzer Prize (1991) for &quot;Near Changes&quot;. She was the U.S. Poet Laureate between 1992 and 1993. Despite her accolades, her career fluctuated between praise and obscurity. Her views of love and marriage ranged from the scathing to the optimistic. In &quot;What I Want to Say&quot;, she wrote of love:
:&quot;It is the absolute narrowing of possibilities&quot;
:&quot;and everyone, down to the last man&quot;
:&quot;dreads it&quot;

But in &quot;Late Loving&quot;, she wrote:
:&quot;Love is finding the familiar dear&quot;

&quot;To See, To Take&quot; (1970) was a collection of poems that gathered together three previous books and some uncollected work and won the National Book Award for Poetry. In 1981 she became a fellow in the Academy of American Poets and then, in 1985, one of the twelve Chancellors who serve for life. Collected poems, &quot;If It Be Not I&quot; (1992) included four volumes that had appeared since her first collected poems. It was published simultaneously with a new collection of poetry, &quot;Firefall&quot;.

In 1993, she was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996.
She died of bone cancer at her home in University City, Missouri, on December 2, 2004, aged 83.

===Early career===

Van Dyke pursued a stand-up comedy career while still in Danville High School and was already a veteran of strip joints and nightclubs when he joined the United States Air Force Tops In Blue in 1954 and 1955. During the mid-1950s, Van Dyke worked at WTHI-TV in Terre Haute, Indiana. &quot;The Jerry Van Dyke Show&quot;, which included future CBS News &quot;Early Show&quot; news anchor Joseph Benti, Nancee South and Ben Falber, was popular fare. In the service, he performed at military bases around the world, twice winning the &quot;All Air Force Talent Show&quot;.

Following his first guest appearances on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and two others on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, CBS made him a regular on &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;. He was also given hosting chores on the 1963 game show &quot;Picture This&quot;. In that same year, movie audiences saw him in supporting roles in &quot;McLintock!&quot;, &quot;Palm Springs Weekend&quot; and &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;.

===Television career===

In 1963 Van Dyke was cast on an episode of &quot;GE True&quot;, hosted by Jack Webb. When &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; was unsuccessfully revamped, Van Dyke left the program. He turned down the offer to play Gilligan on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, a role which instead went to Bob Denver. He appeared as a guest star in one episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. He also appeared in a 1964 episode of &quot;The Cara Williams Show&quot;. Van Dyke finally accepted the lead role of attorney David Crabtree in &quot;My Mother the Car&quot; (1965), the misadventures of a man whose deceased mother Gladys (voiced by Ann Sothern) is reincarnated as a restored antique car. Though the series was a commercial failure, Van Dyke continued to work steadily in supporting television and film roles through the rest of the decade.

He starred in another short-lived situation comedy &quot;Accidental Family&quot; (1967) as widowed comedian Jerry Webster who buys a farm to raise his son while he is not away on professional tours. Well received by critics, Van Dyke was upset when NBC scheduled the show for Fridays at 9:30pm, sandwiched between the poorly-rated &quot;Star Trek&quot; and filler documentaries, known as the Friday night death slot, leading to the show&#x27;s failure.

He was also featured in &quot;Love and Kisses&quot; (1965) and as Andy Griffith&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Angel in My Pocket&quot; (1969).

During the 1970s, Van Dyke returned to stand-up comedy. He spent much of the decade touring Playboy Clubs around the country and headlining venues in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, Summerfest in Milwaukee, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He returned to television for guest appearances on &quot;Love, American Style&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. In 1973 he portrayed Wes Callison, Children&#x27;s Comedy Writer, on the season three episode &quot;But Seriously, Folks&quot; on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. He also had roles in &quot;The Amazing Cosmic Awareness of Duffy Moon&quot; (1976) and &quot;13 Queens Boulevard&quot; (1979). Also in 1989 he appeared as a panelist in the pilot for the revival of &quot;Match Game&quot;, hosted by Bert Convy.

In 1988, Van Dyke made a guest appearance on Scott Baio&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; as Jamie Powell&#x27;s health teacher Mr. Merkin. In 1989, he began portraying beloved, yet befuddled, assistant coach Luther Van Dam on the long-running series &quot;Coach&quot;. For this role, Van Dyke received four Emmy Award nominations from 1990 through 1994 for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series&quot;.

===Later career===
In 1995, Van Dyke appeared in a series of Hardee&#x27;s commercials to promote the Big Hardee, then in the late 1990s acted as the spokesperson for Big Lots. He had a recurring role on &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; as Big Jimmy, the father of Jimmy Hughes. He made a guest appearance on a September 2008 episode of &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; and in 2010 he made an appearance on the second-season episode, &quot;A Simple Christmas&quot; of the television series, &quot;The Middle&quot;, playing Frankie&#x27;s father, Tag Spence. He returned in &quot;Thanksgiving III&quot; in November 2011, &quot;Thanksgiving IV&quot; in November 2012, &quot;From Orson with Love&quot; in May 2013, &quot;Thanksgiving V&quot; in November 2013. and &quot;Flirting with disaster&quot; in March 2015. Van Dyke also played the object of Maw Maw&#x27;s affections on the 18th episode of the first season of &quot;Raising Hope&quot;. In a December 2013 episode of &quot;The Millers&quot; he played Bud Miller, father to Margo Martindale&#x27;s character, Carol. In his final television role in April 2015, he reprised his role as Frankie&#x27;s father on &quot;The Middle&quot;, along with real-life brother Dick Van Dyke playing his character&#x27;s brother.

==Personal life==
Van Dyke was married twice and had three children with first wife Carol: Jerri Lynn, Kelly Jean, and Ronald. Kelly Jean died by suicide in 1991, following struggles with substance abuse.

Jerry and his second wife, Shirley, lived on an ranch near Hot Springs, Arkansas.

Van Dyke was an avid poker player and announced a number of poker tournaments for ESPN in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was also a four-string banjo player with several performances on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; to his credit.

==Death==
On January 5, 2018, Van Dyke died at his Hot Spring County, Arkansas, ranch from heart failure at the age of 86. He had been in declining health after a car accident two years earlier.

<text>Clara Louise Kellogg (July 9, 1842 – May 13, 1916) was an American operatic dramatic soprano a range of two and one-half octaves. Her voice in youth was a high soprano with a range from C to E flat. With age it lost some of the highest notes but gained in power and richness.

==Biography==

Clara Louise Kellogg was born in Sumterville, South Carolina, the daughter of Jane Elizabeth (Crosby) and George Kellogg. She received her musical training in the Academy of Music, New York City, and first sang opera there in 1861. Her fine soprano voice and artistic gifts soon made her famous. She appeared as prima donna in Italian opera in London and at concerts in 1867 and 1868, and from that time till 1887 was one of the leading public singers. She appeared at intervals in London, but was principally engaged in America.

In 1874 Kellogg organized an opera company widely known in the United States, and her enterprise and energy in directing it were remarkable. The company weathered a tragedy on May 26, 1882, when two members, virtuoso pianist Herman Rietzel and bass singer George Conly, drowned on Lake Spofford while on tour.

Kellogg retired after marrying Carl Strakosch in Elkhart, Indiana, on November 6, 1886. In 1913 she published her memoirs under the title &quot;Memoirs of an American Prima Donna&quot;. She died at her home in New Hartford, Connecticut on May 13, 1916.

<doc id="753175" wikidata="Q4927722" url="?curid=753175" title="Blood Syndicate">
<text>The Blood Syndicate is a fictional multicultural vigilante gang of superhumans created by Milestone Comics and published by DC Comics. The team first appeared in &quot;Blood Syndicate&quot; #1 (April 1993), and was created by Dwayne McDuffie, Ivan Velez Jr. and Denys Cowan.

==Publication history==
In Milestone Comics&#x27; fictional city of Dakota, the Blood Syndicate is a loose affiliation of super-powered individuals brought together by circumstance; 35 issues of their eponymous comic book, written largely by Ivan Velez, Jr., were published between 1993 and 1996.

The Blood Syndicate differed from other supergroups in being a gang. In fact, they were the surviving remnants of multiple street gangs (thus the name, a combination of &quot;Paris Island Bloods&quot; and &quot;Force Syndicate&quot;), who had gained superpowers in the so-called Big Bang, and decided to use them for a greater purpose. However, their constant in-fighting, the unsustainability of their methods, and their lack of a central vision (particularly after the death of their first leader) led to the Syndicate&#x27;s eventual disintegration.

==Fictional team history==
The &quot;Big Bang&quot; refers to an incident in which gang members from all over Dakota met in one, huge battle. The police got word of the coming attack and planned to gas the lot of them with tear gas laced with a radioactive marker and take them all into custody. Their plan was to track down any gang member who got away using the radioactive marker. Unknown to them, or even to the police involved, the tear gas used to disperse them was laced with a mutative agent called &quot;quantum juice&quot;. Many gang members and police officers died, while others transformed according to their state of mind or what they were close to when the gas hit them. One woman (a member of the Sociedad De La Cruz gang) landed in water; her body became water and she developed the ability to control other water as well. She named herself Aquamaria. Another woman stumbled into a brick wall, merged with it and became solid brick. Other entities were affected in other ways. A police officer gained the power to emit golden energy blasts and joined the Shadow Cabinet as Oro. Dogg, a normal dog who was the pet of the Force Syndicate, developed human level cognitive abilities and the ability to speak.

===Coming together===
The surviving gang members eventually came together and formed a new gang. Tech Nine, Flashback, Fade and Dogg from the Force Syndicate reached out to whoever else they could find. They reached out to Holocaust first, but he killed them all with his fire powers. Flashback saved them with her power to turn time back three seconds. They convinced him not to attack them again, and he helps them recruit Wise Son (by threatening his family). They found Third Rail in a homeless camp deep below the streets, suffering from guilt over his father. They tricked Juan Templo into leaving the safety of a local church to join them. The group agreed to work together, and after a healthy disagreement, chose the name Blood Syndicate (a combination of the names of the two rival gangs they came from, &quot;Force Syndicate&quot; and &quot;Paris Bloods&quot;).

Their first action as a gang was when they attacked a crack house to steal the money for &quot;operating expenses&quot;. Their raid killed many addicts and criminals, and gained them another member, Masquerade. He was hired to guard the drugs, but the new gang recruited him to join them instead. They went back to &quot;Ground Zero&quot;, the place where the Bang happened, only to be ambushed by a large contingent of local criminals. Templo was killed, but the new gang worked together and killed every last one of their attackers.

===Media spotlight===
Brickhouse and DMZ joined the team at some point after their first crackhouse raid and the annihilation of the attack force. Their exploits attracted the attention of Dakota&#x27;s local media. The Dakota Chronicle, the city&#x27;s most popular newspaper sent reporter, Roberta &quot;Rob&quot; Chaplik, to score an interview with the Syndicate. Chaplik followed them to a raid on a crack-house, their main source of money. She was killed by one of the drug dealers, but Flashback reversed her death by turning back time three seconds and pushing Rob out of the way of the shotgun blast that killed her the first time. Holocaust burned the shooter to death before he could fire again.

Holocaust challenged Tech Nine for leadership of the gang, and by the rules they&#x27;d set down, they had trial by combat to choose which of them would be the leader. Tech Nine took a horrible beating, but thanks to Holocaust&#x27;s arrogance and his own power of unlimited gunfire/telekinetic control over his guns, he won the fight. Holocaust left the gang in anger rather than submit to Tech&#x27;s leadership and went off to form a criminal empire.

They took in a new member, a rat-man called the Boogieman, and sought purpose. The gang didn&#x27;t have a true focus, but as their leader, Tech Nine tried to give them one. They discovered and destroyed a hidden lab under the local hospital where scientists experimented on Bang Babies. Boogieman was a big help in fighting the armored security guards protecting the place, and Brickhouse remembered being experimented on in that very lab. They blew the place sky high, but the lab&#x27;s creator got away to set up shop elsewhere.

The gang went back to their home (an abandoned factory on the land where the Big Bang took place) to celebrate with food and beer. During the party, the quantum juice destabilized Tech&#x27;s body and he died painfully - his flesh melted off of his body. Wise Son took over as leader, but it was clear he was less popular than Tech.

As Wise Son sought to fill Tech&#x27;s shoes, the team faced multiple threats and disasters. They pondered what to do for money when they ran out of crack houses to rob, but before they could plan, a Chinese mobster named John Wing sent his forces to kill the Syndicate so they wouldn&#x27;t interfere with his plans. When they captured him. Wise Son chose to humiliate the man by urinating on him. Wing felt that he had to get revenge at all costs, and murdered his own wife in a supernatural ritual and summoned the Demon Fox. The Fox warned him of the cost of its services, and Wing agreed. After decimating the Syndicate, the Fox returned to Wing to take payment - Wing&#x27;s life.

The Fox attacked the Syndicate in their headquarters and nearly killed the entire team. In the process, the Fox revealed their deepest secrets; the various revelations hurt worse than the significant physical damage from the fight. The Fox would have killed them all if not for the appearance of Kwai, who was reborn in response to the Fox&#x27;s rebirth. Kwai revealed that they were mirror sisters - one cannot exist without the other as a counterbalance.

As the gang members woke up slowly, some of them learned each other&#x27;s secrets. Flashback woke up near Boogieman, and saw that, his speech pattern and mannerisms notwithstanding, Boogieman was white. Fade and Masquerade woke up near each other. During the fight, the Fox reached into Fade&#x27;s mind and revealed that Fade is gay, something he did not want his teammates to ever know. Masquerade overheard, right before taking a severe beating from the Fox. Fade woke up before Masquerade, and saw that Masquerade had reverted to a female form when knocked cold. Fade promised not to tell anyone that Masquerade was born a woman, and Masquerade threatened that if he did, he&#x27;d tell everybody that Fade was gay (he used an anti-gay slur to drive his point home).

Soon after they survived the Demon Fox, a super being named Rift with reality warping powers nearly destroyed their reality and the one inhabited by the DC superheroes. The Syndicate had to fight alongside the heroes they knew (Static, Icon, Rocket, Hardware) and with Superman, Superboy and Steel from the DC universe. Eventually they all manipulated Rift into reversing the damage he caused and to go into hibernation, where he couldn&#x27;t alter reality any further.

Wise Son&#x27;s son Edmund and his little sister Cornelia developed teleportation powers, presumably from following Wise to the Bang. They wrote their destination on mirrors and could then travel through said mirrors to get there.

The team&#x27;s tensions escalated. Wise Son embarrassed Boogieman by forcing him to reveal that he was a white male under all his fur. He acted like he put Boogie off the team for lying to them, but then told him he could stay and don&#x27;t lie to them ever again. This furthered dislike of Wise&#x27;s leadership, particularly by Third Rail. He and Brickhouse developed a romantic relationship and contemplated moving out on their own when Masquerade betrayed the team. They chose to raid one last crackhouse to raise money (they&#x27;d spent most of their reserves on renovations to their headquarters). Kwai was shot during this raid and nearly died. Wise Son blamed Flashback - he&#x27;d told her to watch out for Kwai since she was new, but Flashback was more interested in stealing some of the crack to fuel her habit.

They got Kwai back to their headquarters at her request; she was able to heal herself supernaturally. As the rest of them made their way home, Masquerade stole the money and successfully made a break for it. This widened the growing rift in the team and prompted Third and Brick to take their remaining money and leave the gang to start a life together.

===Tensions===
Masquerade and some other Bang Babies dealt with another branch of S.Y.S.T.E.M. They were captured for a brief time, but escaped, transformed and with their powers enhanced. Masquerade knew he could never return to the Syndicate and sought to make a team of those who were captured, but they all went their separate ways.

Third Rail and Brickhouse left the gang, but still found trouble. They opened a burger joint together, but Third was attacked by a gigantic foe, the Techno Shaman. He possessed Third, but Brickhouse called on her old friends for help and they defeated the Shaman. When he lay defeated, Brickhouse sent the others away and finished him off.

Kwai recovered from her injuries but learned that she was on the last of a series of mystically granted lives. She traveled to her home realm, Kwen Lun, the Wondrous Lands, in a desperate attempt to gain at least one more buffer life. During Kwai&#x27;s troubles, Tech Nine seemingly returned from the dead. His grave was empty, and they had to believe it was him. They looked for Dogg to confirm things, but Dogg was gone. He had been captured by operatives of a murderous organization called &quot;S.Y.S.T.E.M.&quot;, who wanted to experiment on him and other Bang Babies.

Tech spoke boldly to Fade about having feelings for him, something the real Tech never had. Fade was attracted to Tech, but Tech never took it seriously, nor did he slam Fade for his sexual orientation. As the gang searched for Dogg, suspicions mounted about Tech.

Upon returning home, Kwai met with her old friend, the Monkey King, and the two pleaded to her father, the Jade Emperor for another life. The Emperor denied this request, declaring that she had grown too attached to the mortal world. He then sentenced her to death without reincarnation stating that she broke the blood contract between them by rebelling against him.

To save Kwai&#x27;s life, the Monkey King recruited most of the Syndicate to go with him to Kwen Lun to save her, while Tech-9 and Flashback stayed behind as backup. In the Kingdom of Ti Yu (Hell), Kwai was offered marriage to the Dog God to save her existence, but decides she couldn&#x27;t marry him and went to meet the Grey Lady. There she learned that her entire existence as Kwai was nothing more than entertainment for the gods of the Wondrous Lands in the form of a never-ending battle against the Demon Fox. The Grey Lady offered Kwai another chance to live and marry the Dog God, but Kwai refused, deciding that she would no longer allow those gods to control her existence - even if it meant her death. The Grey Lady, impressed with her spirit allowed her to return, with the warning that her father would not stop until he had his revenge.

===The Beginning of the end===
After returning to Earth, the gang barged into Utopia Park uninvited. Their presence caused a riot. Wise Son was responsible for stopping it, as chronicled in the Milestone crossover event &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot;. Tech-9 persuaded him to use the Utopia Park PA system to appeal for an end to the violence. Wise did so eloquently, and the rioters backed down.

After this, they had a final battle with the Demon Fox. They found out that she dug up Tech-Nine&#x27;s body and gave his essence to Masquerade. This enabled him to impersonate Tech so well that he actually believed he was him, and to wield his powers. The Demon Fox and Masquerade, who was in thrall to the Fox, fought the Syndicate tooth and nail. During the fighting, the Fox revealed that Brickhouse was pregnant with Third&#x27;s baby, and apparently caused her to miscarry. Kwai rose up and destroyed the Fox, at the cost of her own life. Kwai didn&#x27;t perish - she reverted to 9 year-old Nina Lam, but seemingly with Kwai&#x27;s memories.

The Syndicate now knew that Masquerade was born female, and confronted him for his deception. He proclaimed that under his leadership they became more efficient than ever before, and that with him, they could achieve their true potential as a team. He convinced none of them and left the team in disgrace. Wise Son disagreed with his methods, but admitted that he was right and that they &quot;never lived up to the hype&quot;. He states that they all kept too many secrets from each other and that they fought each other more than their enemies. The team decided they were tired of the pain that they had endured and the constant violence around them and disbanded. A few days later, while recounting the events of the past ordeal to Rob Chaplik, Dogg appeared before Wise Son and told him that &quot;the Syndicate isn&#x27;t over; it&#x27;s just stopped for a while is all&quot;. Wise Son smiled and replied &quot;thicker than blood, G. Thicker than blood&quot;.

===Milestone Forever===
Since their disbanding, the Blood Syndicate left a hole in the hearts of its members, powerful people left to fend for themselves. Holocaust made his inevitable return and reinstated the Blood Syndicate as they once were; a gang. He tried to take his actions out into the streets and claim Dakota City as his own, but the others rose up against him. Wise Son challenged Holocaust to a battle for the rightful leadership of the Syndicate. Wise Son won, and it seemed that Holocaust burned himself to death, yet again. It remains to be seen if Holocaust actually died, but Wise Son became their undisputed leader. Wise had ideas to bring his family to the light, away from Holocaust&#x27;s fire.

==DC Universe==
Following the death of Darkseid (as chronicled in &quot;Final Crisis&quot;), the space-time continuum was torn asunder, threatening the existence of both the Dakotaverse and the mainstream DC universe. The being known as Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift (upon that being&#x27;s defeat in &quot;Worlds Collide&quot;) to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity. Only Dharma, Icon and Superman are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants ever existed in a parallel universe.

In the revised continuity, Holocaust has been defeated in battle by Static (now a member of the Teen Titans) and the similarly powered Black Lightning (of the Justice League of America).

Solicits have revealed that in February 2010, Holocaust will show up as an adversary of the Teen Titans in issue #80 of their series. On the covers for issues #80 and #81, he is shown battling Aquagirl and Superboy respectively.

==Membership==
* Aquamaria - Maria (last name unknown) survived the Big Bang while floating in the (fictional) James River; as a result, she gained the ability to manipulate and transform into water. She also has substantial control over water in all its forms, being able to create tsunamis and geysers, and shape near-freezing vapor into ice sculptures.
* Boogieman, or Boogie - Martin Berger is able to transform into a giant humanoid rat. He is also able to communicate with the hyper-intelligent rats of Dakota, even when untransformed. A post-Texador member, Berger joined the Syndicate during their attack on the S.Y.S.T.E.M. conspiracy. When his mother was trapped in a hospital full of angry inter-dimensional chihuahuas, he chose to rescue her with only Static as backup.
* Brickhouse (or Brick): Marta (last name unknown) survived the Big Bang while pressed up against a brick wall; as a result, she took on its characteristics, becoming a 10-foot-tall, super-strong woman of living brick. However, this led to a substantial amount of brain damage, and she was subject both to epilepsy and retrograde amnesia (by the time the series was canceled, she still did not know her last name). Her name was inspired by the Commodores song &quot;Brick House&quot;.
* DMZ - DMZ&#x27;s name is an abbreviated form of the term, demilitarized zone. Little is known about him. He has superhuman strength and durability and is able to fly; furthermore, his eyes glow red. DMZ never speaks (except during the &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; crossover, when he said the word &quot;Damn&quot;); nor does he ever take off his mask, even to eat. He spends his free time atop a bridge, whirling a lamp on a chain in the hopes of signaling passing extraterrestrials, and wears what appears to be the uniform of the D&#x27;amsi police officers of Icon&#x27;s interplanetary civilization, the Cooperative. When Icon asked DMZ to join him (when an alien rescue party arrives for Icon) he declines. Dwayne McDuffie stated on his Delphi forum that DMZ is a human who teamed up with a member of the D&#x27;amsi police force when she chased a criminal to Earth. He was severely wounded saving her life, so she used her technology to optimize him, unlocking his full human potential. She left the Earth to chase the villain as he healed, promising to return for him. He got his name from a mis-heard &#x27;D&#x27;amsi&#x27;.
* Dogg: Originally Texador&#x27;s/Tech-9&#x27;s pet dog, Dogg gains human-level intelligence and speech, while remaining a dog in shape, personality, and abilities. First introduced in issue #2, he became a valued member of the team despite his size and shape. When Pyre formed his own Blood Syndicate, Dogg was one of those who rejected the offer to join.
* Fade: Carlos Quinones Jr. is the brother of Sara Quinones (Flashback). He can fly and pass through solid objects (quantum tunnelling), and frequently has difficulty becoming substantial. He is actually &quot;spread out&quot; over a three-second interval, and is thereby able to, for instance, punch someone and leave them unharmed until after he has left, as was stated in the comic: &quot;Fade isn&#x27;t what he does, it&#x27;s what he endures&quot;. He is a deeply closeted gay man, and was in love with Texador (Tech-9). He also has the undeveloped ability to travel back (and possibly forward) in time by significant amounts, evidenced by Kwai recognising him the first time she meets the Syndicate, as someone she had known in one of her previous incarnations. A side effect of this ability are the instances of clairvoyance he sometimes displays.
* Flashback: Sara Quinones, sister of Carlos Quinones (Fade). Flashback can fly and can travel back in time three seconds, an ability she uses to change the past. She considers herself responsible for the welfare of the Syndicate as a whole because she has witnessed (and reversed) their deaths and severe injuries on multiple occasions. She is also a crack addict, partly because of the stress of having seen her friends die so many times, which only she remembers. Later, Rocket, sidekick to Icon, would intervene in her drug habit.
* Holocaust (later Pyre): Leonard Smalls, Jr. is the illegitimate son of Dakota mayor Thomasina Jefferson. A superhumanly strong pyrokinetic, Smalls left the Syndicate after a leadership struggle with Texador/Tech-9, and chose to abandon the small-scale world of gangs for the greater possibilities offered by organized crime. As an initiation ritual, he was obliged to surrender something of great value to him: his name, and the reputation that came with it. Unable to call himself Holocaust, Smalls renamed himself Pyre. As Pyre, he tried to reform a new Blood Syndicate of his own recruiting: Boogieman, Flashback, Mistress Death, Bad Betty, Fade, Tarmack, Bubbasaurus, and Rocket (who was undercover). Smalls then reclaimed his name - Holocaust.

* Kwai (Shen Hsien Pu Kwei) - one of the two non-Bang Babies in the Blood Syndicate (DMZ being the other), Nina Lam was the 77th - and last - incarnation of a Chinese mystical being. Originally a 9-year-old girl, Lam was mystically transformed into a 7-foot-tall adult woman with albino-pale skin, immensely long hair, and pointed ears. She encountered the Syndicate in the wake of their defeat by the Demon Fox, and thanks to Flashback, survived a booby trap set by John Wing&#x27;s Demon Fox Tong. After the Blood Syndicate was saved and restored by Nina Lam, now Kwai, she joins the Blood Syndicate and periodically calmed Brickhouse&#x27;s seizures. Kwai fought alongside the Blood Syndicate a number of times and was once shot during a crackhouse raid; while she went into a healing cocoon, Hannibal White (Wise Son) tortured Kwai&#x27;s shooter. Later Kwai&#x27;s healing light changed the Blood Syndicate back to normal for a short time, and learns that she&#x27;s down to her last life. After Brickhouse and Third Rail leave, Kwai decided to leave, later seen returning to her homeland, the Kingdom of Kwen Lun; meeting with her old friend, the Monkey King, revealing that she needs to ask her father, the Jade Emperor for another life, as she is sentenced to death without reincarnation. Ending up in the Kingdom of Ti Yu (hell), Kwai was offered marriage to the Dog God there to save her existence, but decides she can&#x27;t marry him; finally in a battle royale with the Blood Syndicate against the Demon Fox, Kwai and the Demon Fox apparently destroyed each other, leaving the 9-year-old Nina Lam surviving. Later in the &quot;Static Shock: Return of The Cool&quot; mini-series, Nina is shown meeting with the Syndicate, and apparently attempting to transform back into Kwai by saying her name, reminiscent of the &#x27;SHAZAM&#x27; transformation of DC&#x27;s Captain Marvel. Although she is rendered unconscious before she can say the word, she is later seen in the form of Kwai, implying that she has been granted a &#x27;normal life&#x27; as Nina, with the potential to become Kwai in times of danger.
* Masquerade: A shapechanger able to assume the form of any animal (including humans), Masquerade is a transgender man. He kept his assigned gender (female) to himself, using his abilities to present himself as the man he truly was. He fled the Syndicate after reflexively stealing several thousand dollars from them. A brief encounter later failed to convince him the Syndicate had changed their ways, and he would not be killed for his betrayal. He returned in the guise of a resurrected Rolando Texador (Tech-9), hoping to be accepted as their leader. As leader, Masquerade was responsible for the Syndicate instigating the Utopia Park riot.
* Oro: Miguel Medina is a former police officer who survived the Big Bang as a member of the Riot Squad. After the Big-Bang, he was for a time a member of the Shadow Cabinet but was kicked out, and later framed for the murder of his ex-partner. He subsequently sought refuge with the Syndicate and helped protect their territory. He can fly, project energy blasts and produce blinding visual displays. Being an ex-policeman, he took some time to win the respect of the rest of the Syndicate, having to endure the nickname &#x27;Oral&#x27; for some time.

* Tech-9 (or Tech): Rolando Texador, formerly leader of the Force Syndicate, had the ability of &quot;talismanic telekinesis&quot;, making him able to shoot endless quantities of bullets from any and all guns, with perfect accuracy. He could also materialize guns in his hands; his favored was the Tech-9 semi-automatic handgun, which he takes his name from. Charismatic and with military training, he masterminded the Syndicate&#x27;s formation and led them in their raids on crackhouses, but his flesh spontaneously melted off his bones when his superpower destabilized. Later in the series, Masquerade impersonates Tech-9, having sided with the Demon Fox.
* Third Rail: The son of Korean immigrants, Pui Chung is able to absorb any form of energy and use it to grow in size and strength.
* Wise Son (or Wise): Hannibal White, leader of the Syndicate after Texador&#x27;s death and a Black Muslim (&quot;Wise Son&quot; is a Qur&#x27;anic reference), is invulnerable and has superstrength. Although he is able to, for instance, shave his head (as he did in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Wise Son: the White Wolf&quot; miniseries by Ho Che Anderson), he is completely immune from physical harm. Wise Son was responsible for stopping the Utopia Park riot, chronicled in the Milestone crossover event &#x27;Long Hot Summer&#x27;, after Masquerade, disguised as Tech-9, persuaded him to use the Utopia Park PA system to appeal for an end to the violence. He has also shown the ability to resist mental manipulation, and to survive the draining of large quantities of his lifeforce. He is the father of Edmund White, and has sole custody.

==Other characters==
*Babe - Bodyguard of the &quot;House of L&#x27;Amour&quot; beauty salon, and possibly lover to its transvestite beautician. As a Bang Baby, he resembles a humanoid blue ox. He is seen in issue #27 &quot;&quot;Possessions&quot; - returning to the House of L&#x27;Amour after being held by S.Y.S.T.E.M. (originally, he was distraught after returning from S.Y.S.T.E.M. with an enhanced—more muscular—appearance).
*Bubbasaur/Bubbasaurus - Bubba Brown, able to turn into a huge dinosaur-like creature resembling a carnotaurus; introduced in issue #11 as a spurned student going after a high school principal—Carlos Quinones Sr. (Fade&#x27;s father), though Bubba Brown was seemingly killed in a fight with Fade (Carlos Quinones Jr.), he was picked up by Mom&#x27;s S.Y.S.T.E.M. troops and taken to Garden Station. He joins in an escape attempt by the other prisoners.
*Demon Fox - A Chinese mystical vampire who first appears in issue #6. John Wing, leader of the Demon Fox Tong, awakened it after killing his wife, in response to being humiliated by the Blood Syndicate after failing to kill them. The Demon Fox finally strikes in issues #7 &amp; #8 as it tears apart the Blood Syndicate, bringing up each member&#x27;s darkest secrets. After defeating the group, the Demon Fox kills Wing after granting his wish. Afterward, it is defeated by a newly transformed Kwai (previously Nina Lam) who comes to the rescue of the Blood Syndicate. The Demon Fox aided Masquerade in imitating Tech-9 - by giving Masquerade some of Tech-9&#x27;s essence so she can assume leadership of the Blood Syndicate; in issue #35, &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; - in an all-out battle between the Demon Fox and Masquerade vs the Blood Syndicate - Kwai and the Demon Fox destroy each other.

*Mom - The head of the Amber Cell of the S.Y.S.T.E.M./Coalition &amp; heading the research into creating custom-made Bang-Babies and controlling them. Mom runs the Garden Station, the command center for the Amber sector of S.Y.S.T.E.M.
*Templo - Juan Templo; a telekinetic and one of the founding Blood Syndicate members, was first seen in issue #9 &quot;Fade to Back&quot; in December 1993—the origin of the Blood Syndicate following the Big Bang is seen; the Blood Syndicate believed Templo was killed—but in issue #19, &quot;Collections&quot;, Templo is seen alive in a hospital. In issue #21, &quot;Retrievals&quot;, Templo is seen at the Garden Station where he is revived by Mom&#x27;s scientists; in issue #24, &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; Templo, along with others (Karess, Babe, Masquerade, Oro, and the Cross Station survivor) survived the Garden Station war. In issue #26, &quot;Prodigals&quot;&quot;, Templo along with Mistress Mercy and Rose go to the church of Father Francisco.
*White Roaches and the Rats - Two groups of vermin who acquired human characteristics during the Big Bang, they are now large, intelligent, and (especially in the case of the White Roaches) hostile.

<doc id="753177" wikidata="Q1545849" url="?curid=753177" title="Vanessa (opera)">
<text>Vanessa is an American opera in three (originally four) acts by Samuel Barber, opus 32, with an original English libretto by Gian Carlo Menotti. It was composed in 1956–1957 and was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on January 15, 1958 under the baton of Dimitri Mitropoulos in a production designed by Cecil Beaton and directed by Menotti. Barber revised the opera in 1964, reducing the four acts to the three-act version most commonly performed today.

==Performance history==
For the Met premiere, Sena Jurinac was contracted to sing the title role. However, she cancelled six weeks before the opening night and Eleanor Steber replaced her, making the role her own for a long time. In the role of Erika, Vanessa&#x27;s niece, was Rosalind Elias, then a young mezzo-soprano. Nicolai Gedda sang the lover Anatol, mezzo Regina Resnik sang the Baroness, Vanessa&#x27;s mother, while bass Giorgio Tozzi sang the old doctor. It was the first American opera in 11 years to be seen at the company, and only the 20th in 73 years.

The premiere &quot;was an unqualified success with the audience and with many of the critics as well although they were somewhat qualified in their judgment. Of the final quintet, however, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Howard Taubman said it is &#x27;...a full-blown set-piece that packs an emotional charge and that would be a credit to any composer anywhere today.&#x27;&quot; Other reports substantiate this and it won Barber the Pulitzer Prize. The original production was shown at the Salzburg Festival in the same year, which was the first performance in Europe. In Europe, however, it met with a chillier reception.

The Met&#x27;s Cecil Beaton sets were destroyed by fire in 1973. After a long period of few revivals, one being in 1988 by the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, the Washington National Opera (in a co-production with the Dallas Opera) revived the work in 1995 using the 1964 revised and more compact version. Elizabeth Holleque sang the title role.

Kiri Te Kanawa sang the title role in three revivals, the first of which was presented by the Opéra de Monte-Carlo in 2001, the second in 2002 at the Washington National Opera and the third in 2004 (at the time, described as her farewell to the opera stage), at the Los Angeles Opera.

In all three productions, Rosalind Elias, who sang Erika in the 1958 premiere, took on the role of the Baroness. For its 50th anniversary revival by the New York City Opera in November 2007, she was once more featured in that role, with Lauren Flanigan taking the title role.

Highlights from the score include the soprano scena and aria &quot;He has come, he has come!...Do Not Utter a Word&quot; (recorded by Leontyne Price, Roberta Alexander, and Renée Fleming), the mezzo aria &quot;Must the Winter Come So Soon?&quot; (recorded by Denyce Graves and Roberta Alexander), and the last-act quintet, &quot;To Leave, to Break&quot;.

==Source of the story==
In many print media it says that the libretto of Gian Carlo Menotti is based on a work of Isak Dinesen (pen name of Karen Blixen), described variously as a &quot;short story&quot; or &quot;novella&quot;. However, the story is not found in any of Isak Dinesen&#x27;s works. There is evidence of Samuel Barber&#x27;s having read Blixen&#x27;s &quot;Seven Gothic Tales&quot;, and the mistaking of the proper source may have come from a proclamation by Menotti and Barber, that the opera reproduced the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of Isak Dinesen&#x27;s &quot;Seven Gothic Tales.&quot; &quot;Menotti recalled, &#x27;I was writing a libretto for Sam, and Sam is essentially a romantic personality...&#x27;&quot; Menotti was &quot;inspired by Isak Dinesen&#x27;s stories, in particular her &quot;Seven Gothic Tales.&quot; He said, &#x27;I felt that the atmosphere... would make a wonderful opera.&#x27;&quot;

Blixen was present at the premiere of the opera, but part way through the performance she pleaded illness and left the theater. Her secretary wrote that Barber was &quot;upset&quot; by Blixen&#x27;s premature departure from the opera. Blixen made no public comment.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Time: About 1905.
:Place: Vanessa&#x27;s country house in a northern country.
===Act 1===
In her secluded country house, Vanessa awaits the arrival of Anatol, a man who had been Vanessa&#x27;s lover twenty years before. After he left, she covered up all the mirrors of the house until his expected return, unwilling to face looking at her aging self. She lives alone with her mother, the Baroness, who has refused to speak to her for twenty years, and with her niece, Erika. Thinking that the man who arrives and who is called Anatol is her former lover, Vanessa refuses to reveal her face to him until he says he still loves her. He says that he does, but she does not recognize him. It is the young Anatol who has come, his father now dead. Upset, Vanessa leaves the room, and Erika and Anatol now enjoy the meal and wine meant for Vanessa and his father.

===Act 2===
Erika tells the Baroness that the young Anatol seduced her on his first night in the house and the Baroness scolds her. Erika has fallen in love with Anatol, but resists his marriage proposal because she doubts his sincerity. Not knowing that Erika loves the young man and in her delusionary state of mind, Vanessa tells her niece that she still loves him, despite Erika&#x27;s warning that he is not her former lover. The Baroness tells Erika to fight for Anatol. She is unsure if he is worthy of her efforts. Again, he proposes, and, again, she declines.

===Act 3===
The doctor is drunk at a New Year&#x27;s Eve ball. The Baroness and Erika refuse to come to the party to hear his announcement of Anatol and Vanessa&#x27;s engagement. The doctor goes to fetch them, while Vanessa tells Anatol her fears. Finally Erika, who, unbeknownst to everyone else, is pregnant, comes downstairs, but faints, clutching her stomach, while the doctor is making the announcement. She recovers and flees into the freezing weather in order to cause herself to miscarry. (In the original she says, &quot;His child! It must not be born!&quot; which makes clear her motivation for going out into the cold, but this line is dropped in the revision.)

===Act 4===
Vanessa is happy when Erika is found alive, and she asks Anatol why Erika is acting so strangely and whether he thinks that she loves him. He explains that she does not. Continuing in her delusionary state, Vanessa begs Anatol to take her away. Meanwhile, Erika confesses to the Baroness that she had been pregnant, but is no longer. The Baroness, horrified, refuses to speak to her.

As Vanessa and Anatol finalize their preparations to move to Paris, Vanessa asks Erika why she ran away. The niece replies that she was just being foolish, and Vanessa says she may never come back to the house where she has been living. After the couple leaves, Erika covers the mirrors and closes up the house, just as Vanessa had done before her. She says that it is now her turn to wait.

<text>The Daily Southtown (formerly SouthtownStar) is a newspaper of the Chicago, Illinois, United States, metropolitan area that covers the south suburbs and the South Side neighborhoods of the city – a wide region known as the Chicago Southland. Its popular slogan is &quot;People Up North Just Don&#x27;t Get It&quot; (a pun). It is published by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; Media Group.

== History ==
Founded on September 11, 1906, the &quot;Southtown&quot; celebrated its 100th year as a paper in 2006. Originally called the Englewood Economist, it was retitled the Southtown Economist in 1924 and began publishing twice weekly. The newspaper relocated from Chicago&#x27;s Englewood community to the west end of the city in Garfield Ridge in 1968.

The company started publishing a six-day a week edition called the &quot;Daily Southtown&quot; on February 26, 1978. While the launch of the new publication was already being planned, the launch date was moved up when the Chicago Daily News announced it would publish its last edition March 4, 1978. The company continued to publish its weekly and bi-weekly publications for some time.

In 1986, the &quot;Daily Southtown&quot; was purchased by Pulitzer Publishing; who sold the paper in 1994 to the American Publishing Company. The paper relocated to suburban Tinley Park in 1997.

On November 18, 2007, the twice-weekly neighborhood newspaper, &quot;The Star&quot; was merged into the &quot;Daily Southtown&quot; to create the SouthtownStar, which is circulated daily with a special Neighborhood Star pull-out section on Thursdays and Sundays. In 2014, the &quot;SouthtownStar&quot; was purchased by the Chicago Tribune Media Group along with the other Wrapports Chicago suburban papers. The name was changed back to the &quot;Daily Southtown&quot;.

The paper maintains bureaus in Chicago city hall and the city&#x27;s federal courts building.

Like its larger counterparts, the newspaper also entered into the broadcasting business in 1925 with a license to operate radio station WBCN. WBCN started broadcasting on 1130 kHz from the paper&#x27;s offices at 65th and Halsted. They soon entered into an agreement of time-sharing of the frequency with radio station WENR, then owned by the All-American Radio Company. By the next year, both stations had moved to 1040 kHz, still retaining their time-sharing agreement. By 1927, Chicago financial magnate Samuel Insull had become interested in both WBCN and WENR. Insull, who had been a founder of station KYW, sold his interest in the station. His newly formed Great Lakes Broadcasting bought them both, and moved them on the dial to 870 kHz. When Insull&#x27;s fortune began to disappear, he sold the licenses of both radio stations to National Broadcasting Company in 1931. The two were officially merged with WBCN leaving the air in early 1933.

== Awards ==
In 2006, the &quot;Southtown&quot; was named Newspaper of the Year among the nation&#x27;s large circulation suburban dailies by Suburban Newspapers of America and the American Press Institute. The judges said: &quot;This is a terrific newspaper – its spot-news coverage is both broad and deep, and its feature stories are as good as those of the country&#x27;s best newspapers. The newspaper puts a lot of effort into providing value to readers – and it shows.&quot;

The paper also won the Illinois Associated Press Award for General Excellence in 2006, the national Fred M. Hechinger Grand Prize for Distinguished Education Reporting, and the Chicago Headline Club&#x27;s Watchdog Award for Reporting in the Public Interest.

In 2010 photo editor Larry Ruehl and staff photographer Matt Marton received the Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for feature photography.

== Notable staff ==
The &quot;Southtown&quot; has produced a number of noteworthy journalists in its history.

Among its resident writers is Phil Kadner, who has written a daily column for two decades. In 2002, he won the Studs Terkel Award for journalistic excellence for writing from a grassroots perspective, and has received several Peter Lisagor Awards for commentary. Of his most recent Lisagor win in 2006, the judges wrote: &quot;His writing is absolutely clean. ... No personal vanity, and eyes open to the world and the ordinary people who are so extraordinary in it.&quot;

Paul Ladewski served as the first &quot;Daily Southtown&quot; sports editor, and he went on to become a Lisagor Award-winner as well as the 2005 Illinois Sports Columnist of the Year. He was the only full-time beat writer to cover the Michael Jordan era in Chicago from start to finish. As a member of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, in the wake of the steroids controversy, Ladewski touched off a nationwide debate and raised awareness with the only known blank ballot in the 2007 National Baseball Hall of Fame election. In all, he covered more than 3,000 MLB, NBA, NHL and NFL games as a beat reporter or columnist.

Kevin Carmody, environment reporter, won a 1999 George Polk Award, one of the nation&#x27;s most prestigious prizes in journalism, for his stories on the official cover-up of the illness and death of employees exposed to toxic metals decades ago in A-bomb factories. His series &quot;Deadly Silence&quot; revealed how hundreds of scientists, tradesmen and secretaries at a Manhattan Project lab at the University of Chicago were carelessly exposed to the toxic metal beryllium, then for 45 years intentionally kept in the dark about the potentially deadly health consequences.

Cornelia Grumman, a 2003 Pulitzer Prize winning editorial writer at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; for her death penalty editorials, was a reporter at the &quot;Southtown&quot;. Cathleen Falsani, author of &quot;The God Factor&quot; and now the religion reporter for the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;, got her start in newspapers as the religion beat writer for the &quot;Southtown&quot;. Other writers who cut their teeth on the news business at the &quot;Southtown&quot; include Mark Konkol 2011 Pulitzer Prize winner for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and now writer-at-large for DNAInfo.com, author-blogger-columnist Allison Hantschel and David Heinzmann of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

Former education reporter Linda Lutton helped bring down a corrupt school superintendent, which resulted in a prison sentence. In 2004, Lutton won the Studs Terkel award as well, for her writings on housing, education, crime and public safety, culture and politics.

The newspaper also featured sports columnist Bill Gleason. Gleason was known for his ever-present cigar and willingness to criticize anyone in the field of sports.

<text>Sulzeer Jeremiah &quot;Sol&quot; Campbell (born 18 September 1974) is an English professional football manager and former player. Widely regarded as one of the best centre-backs of his generation, he spent 20 years playing in the Premier League and had an 11-year international career with the England national team.

Born in East London to Jamaican parents, Campbell began his career with Tottenham Hotspur in December 1992. He spent nine years at Spurs, scoring 10 goals in 255 appearances, and was appointed club captain in 1997, leading the team to victory in the 1999 Football League Cup final against Leicester City. In 2001, he joined Tottenham&#x27;s North London rivals Arsenal on a free transfer, and as a result has remained a deeply unpopular figure amongst Spurs supporters. In his five years and 195 appearances at Arsenal, he won two Premier League winners medals and three FA Cup winners medals, encompassing the 2001–02 league and FA Cup double, and being part of the team that became known as &quot;The Invincibles&quot; for their undefeated 2003–04 Premier League campaign. He scored Arsenal&#x27;s only goal in their 2–1 defeat to Barcelona in the 2006 UEFA Champions League final.

In August 2006, he joined Portsmouth on a free transfer. His three years with the club included captaining them to victory in the 2008 FA Cup final. After a surprising stint at League Two side Notts County, he returned to train with Arsenal and re-signed with the club on a short term contract. He then spent a season with Newcastle United, before announcing his retirement a year later. Following a brief foray into politics in which he failed to be shortlisted for the 2016 London mayoral election, Campbell moved into coaching and was later named as the assistant manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team. He became the new manager of Macclesfield Town, eventually saving the club from relegation to the National League. After leaving the club in the summer, he joined Southend United, who were in a similar relegation battle. However, the season was ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which culminated in Southend&#x27;s relegation and Campbell leaving the club by mutual consent.

Campbell gained his first of 73 full caps for England aged 21. In May 1998, Campbell became what was then England&#x27;s second-youngest captain, after Bobby Moore, aged 23 years 248 days. In 2006, he became the only player to have represented England in six consecutive major tournaments, playing in the 1996, 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships; and the 1998, 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. He was named in the Team of the Tournament for the 2002 World Cup. He was in the PFA Team of the Year three times, in 1999, 2003 and 2004.

==Early life==
Campbell was born in Plaistow, London, to Jamaican parents Sewell and Wihelmina. He was the youngest of twelve children, nine of whom were boys. His father was a railway worker and his mother, Wihelmina, was a Ford factory worker. Despite growing up in a rough neighbourhood in a family with very little money, Campbell veered away from a life of crime due to his strict parents.

Campbell attended the Portway Primary School and had secondary education at Lister Community School, both in Plaistow. He was a prodigious schoolboy talent and was part-educated at the FA&#x27;s School of Excellence at Lilleshall, where he met table tennis player and later football agent Sky Andrew. Campbell had a short spell at West Ham United, beginning his career as a striker. He left the Youth programme at Upton Park after a coach joked to him that Campbell would be pleased to hear that the West Indies were beating England at cricket; Campbell took this to be offensive.

==Club career==
===Tottenham Hotspur===
Following his experience at West Ham United, Campbell was reluctant to join another professional club&#x27;s youth programme, but after two months of persistence from Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s chief scout Len Cheesewright, he eventually joined the Tottenham Youth team. Youth team manager Keith Waldon later recalled that it was his physicality rather than his technical ability which made him stand out as a good prospect for the future. At age 14, he was one of only 16 young footballers accepted onto a training programme at Lilleshall Hall. Waldon offered to make him captain of the youth team, but Campbell declined the offer as he wanted to concentrate on his own game.

Campbell made his first team debut for Spurs on 5 December 1992 against Chelsea at White Hart Lane, scoring the goal in a 2–1 defeat after coming on as a substitute for Nick Barmby. Despite this start to his career, he was not picked by manager Terry Venables again throughout the remainder of the 1992–93 season.

New boss Osvaldo Ardiles played him at left back at the start of the 1993–94 season in place of the injured Justin Edinburgh, before he was switched to right back in place of Dean Austin. At the end of the season, he signed a four-year contract with the club.

New manager Gerry Francis led the club to the semi-finals of the FA Cup in the 1994–95 campaign, but Campbell missed the match due to injury and Spurs were beaten by Everton. Campbell continued to progress in his performances, but Spurs struggled to mid-table league finishes in the 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons. Francis appointed Campbell as club captain, taking over the role from the out of favour David Howells. He had a strained relationship with short-lived manager Christian Gross during the 1997–98 season as Spurs again struggled. Gross&#x27;s replacement, George Graham, also had a difficult relationship with Campbell.

Campbell successfully captained his side to a League Cup final win over Leicester City in the 1998–99 season. This made him the first black captain to lift a major trophy at Wembley Stadium. He was also named on the PFA Team of the Year, as was teammate David Ginola.

The League Cup success qualified Spurs to compete in the UEFA Cup during the 1999–2000 campaign, but they only made it into the Second Round before they were beaten by German side 1. FC Kaiserslautern. During this time, he was falsely accused of breaking a stewards arm during a scuffle in a game at Derby County, and refused Tottenham&#x27;s lawyer&#x27;s advice to have the case Bound over (meaning he would not be convicted but would effectively have admitted some level of wrongdoing), and was subsequently told by the club to field his own legal defence for the case. The case was later dismissed. The club&#x27;s lack of progress in the league, his poor relationship with recent managers and the club&#x27;s lack of support during the assault case left Campbell feeling disillusioned with Spurs.

Campbell missed three months of the 2000–01 campaign after dislocating his shoulder in a 0–0 League Cup draw with Brentford at Griffin Park. He made his final appearance for the club in the FA Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford. Manager Glenn Hoddle admitted it was a risk to play Campbell as the defender was not at full fitness, and he injured his ankle fouling Ray Parlour before he was eventually replaced by Ledley King. However, before the substitution could be made, Patrick Vieira scored a header for Arsenal while Campbell was off the pitch receiving treatment.

In the summer of 2001, Campbell&#x27;s contract expired. Mindful of the Bosman ruling and what happened with Steve McManaman (Britain&#x27;s first high-profile Bosman related transfer), Tottenham offered him a contract which would have made him the club&#x27;s highest-ever paid player, but after months of negotiations and several public assurances he would stay at Spurs, Campbell stated his need to leave the club in order to play UEFA Champions League football, with the likes of England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson advising him of such a course. Several top continental clubs expressed interest in signing him, but he joined Arsenal – Tottenham&#x27;s biggest rivals – on a free transfer. Campbell had previously stated in an interview with &quot;Spurs Monthly&quot; magazine that he would never play for Arsenal. The move was also unusual as no rumours of a move to Arsenal had been leaked or speculated upon in the media before the press conference revealing his decision, and many journalists in attendance had been led to believe they were there to witness the unveiling of goalkeeper Richard Wright, which would have been a routine sports news story.

Campbell has been labelled &quot;Judas&quot; by some Spurs supporters. Years later, the anger from Spurs supporters remained. In January 2009, four Tottenham fans were banned from every football ground in England and Wales for three years after being found guilty of chanting an offensive song containing indecent language (with homophobic content and content which some observers interpreted as racist) aimed at Campbell. In Campbell&#x27;s words:

===Arsenal===
Arsène Wenger later said he signed Campbell as he found that when playing against him, his attackers could not pass him like they could other players and that &quot;it was as if he was indestructible, such a power spread from him&quot;. He made his debut for the Gunners on 18 August – the opening day of the 2001–02 Premier League season, in a 4–0 win over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium. During the season, Campbell was partnered at the back by either Tony Adams (who would retire at the end of the season) or Martin Keown. He made a return to White Hart Lane during a 1–1 draw on 17 November, and though he played well, he was shocked to see his older brother Tony in the crowd supporting Spurs as the fans shouted insults out to Campbell on the pitch. Campbell enjoyed immediate success with Arsenal, as he won both Premier League and FA Cup winners&#x27; medals as Arsenal won the Double in his first season at Highbury. In the FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium on 4 May, he played alongside Adams as the team kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over Chelsea. Four days later, they secured the league title with a 1–0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford.

The 2002–03 season saw Arsenal exit the Champions League at the group stage, but remained on course for a retention of the Double as they reached the final of the FA Cup. However, he missed the end-of-season run-in due to suspension after referee Mark Halsey gave him a straight red card for an alleged elbow on Manchester United&#x27;s Ole Gunnar Solskjær. The club appealed the suspension but were unsuccessful, and he was forced to miss the cup final as Arsenal defeated Southampton to retain the trophy, though they ended the league campaign in second place. His performances were recognised with a place on the PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammates Lauren, Ashley Cole, Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires and Thierry Henry.

The following season, 2003–04, would be known as &quot;The Invincibles season&quot; as Campbell formed a new partnership with Kolo Touré, with the pair instrumental in helping Arsenal regain the Premier League title without losing a single match. The title was secured with a 2–2 draw with Spurs at White Hart Lane on 25 April. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career, alongside teammates Lauren, Cole, Vieira, Pires and Henry.

Campbell missed the start of the 2004–05 season with a knee injury, and so missed the 2004 FA Community Shield victory over Manchester United. The unbeaten run continued to a record 49 matches before Manchester United defeated them 2–0 at Old Trafford on 24 October in a match that would become known as the &quot;Battle of the Buffet&quot;. Referee Mike Riley gave a penalty after Campbell challenged Wayne Rooney, though Campbell would maintain that the young striker had taken a dive. Towards the end of the campaign, Wenger began playing Kolo Touré and one of Pascal Cygan and Philippe Senderos in central defence, and Campbell was benched, leaving him to complain to the manager that Senderos was a &quot;lucky player&quot; who should not be considered good enough to play at Campbell&#x27;s expense. Arsenal again finished second in the league and won the FA Cup final at Manchester United&#x27;s expense, though Campbell was an unused substitute in the match.

In the 2005–06 season, Campbell was blighted both with injuries and a loss of form. In Arsenal&#x27;s 3–2 home loss to West Ham United on 1 February, Campbell was largely responsible for West Ham&#x27;s first two goals before being substituted at half-time at his own request. Unusually, he then left the stadium, not staying to watch the second half. His teammate Robert Pires commented that Campbell was facing a &quot;big worry&quot; in relation to his private life, and Campbell did not make any contact with the club for several days. He left the country and spent a week with a friend in Brussels as he reflected on his life. He resumed training with his teammates on 6 February.

Campbell was back playing on 25 April in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final against Villarreal in Spain, where a 0–0 draw on the night put &quot;the Gunners&quot; into the final. In the final against Barcelona at the Stade de France, Paris, Campbell scored the opening goal, a header from a free-kick taken from Henry after a foul on Emmanuel Eboué. However, ten-man Arsenal went on to lose 2–1, although Campbell was at least involved in the best defensive run of any team in the history of the competition, with opponents failing to score against Arsenal in ten consecutive matches and a total of 995 minutes. Campbell also holds the distinction, alongside Teddy Sheringham, Steve McManaman, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney, as one of six Englishmen to have scored in a Champions League final. In July 2006, Campbell left Arsenal by mutual consent in order to seek &quot;a fresh challenge&quot;.

===Portsmouth===

Campbell was courted by Italian club Juventus, but manager Didier Deschamps eventually ended contract negotiations. Campbell then rejected an approach from Turkish side Fenerbahçe. Instead, he remained in England and joined Premier League club Portsmouth, signing a two-year contract in August 2006. His time at &quot;Pompey&quot; started well, as he formed a successful partnership in the centre of defence with Linvoy Primus and helped the club to keep five consecutive clean sheets. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win over Sheffield United on 23 December.

He was named as captain for the 2007–08 season by manager Harry Redknapp, and signed a new two-year contract with the club. He captained the club to a 1–0 win over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium in the 2008 FA Cup final.

The club went into severe financial difficulties, and Redknapp resigned, but Campbell stayed and helped the club to avoid relegation in the 2008–09 campaign. In January 2010, Campbell sued Portsmouth for £1.7 million in unpaid image rights and bonus payments.

===Notts County===
Campbell signed a five-year deal with League Two side Notts County in August 2009. Campbell said that County, who had recently been the subject of a takeover by a Middle Eastern consortium, were the best club for &quot;where I am at the moment in my life&quot;, and that the recent appointment of ex-England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson as director of football played a &quot;big role&quot; in his decision. He made his debut for County in a 2–1 defeat to Morecambe at Christie Park on 19 September. He walked out on the club three days later, and his contract was cancelled by mutual consent on 24 September. He later admitted he felt embarrassed and that &quot;I was being a mug&quot; in believing the club&#x27;s owners were ambitious billionaires who intended to take the club into the Premier League.

===Return to Arsenal===
Campbell began training with the Arsenal side in mid-October 2009 in a bid to maintain his fitness ahead of the January transfer window. On 15 January, he re-signed with the club. It was announced he would wear the number 31 shirt. Nine days later, he made his second debut for &quot;the Gunners&quot; in an FA Cup defeat to Stoke City. On 18 February, he scored his first goal in his second stint at the club with a headed goal against Porto in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16. Due to injuries to Thomas Vermaelen and William Gallas towards the end of the season, he found himself starting frequently for Arsenal.

===Newcastle United===
In July 2010, after turning down an offer of a two-year contract with Scottish club Celtic, Campbell joined Newcastle United on a one-year contract. He made his first appearance for &quot;the Magpies&quot; in a League Cup win over Chelsea on 22 September. On 3 October, he made his Premier League debut for the club as a 38th-minute substitute for Fabricio Coloccini in a 2–1 defeat to Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium. In doing so, he became only the second player after Ryan Giggs to play in the first 19 seasons of the Premier League. On 28 November, Campbell made his first Premier League start for Newcastle against Chelsea, and was given the captain&#x27;s armband after Shola Ameobi was substituted. Campbell started again in Newcastle&#x27;s next two fixtures with West Bromwich Albion and Liverpool, but lost his place upon the return of Coloccini. After a long period out with viruses, Campbell returned to bench duty in January, making his first appearance in two months as a substitute in Newcastle&#x27;s 2–0 win over Birmingham City on 15 February.

In May 2011, manager Alan Pardew announced Campbell was a free agent after the club opted not to renew his contract. Campbell announced his retirement from football a year later in May 2012.

==International career==
Campbell was a regular through the various England youth teams, and picked up two man of the match awards during the 1993 UEFA European Under-19 Championship which England won with a 1–0 win over Turkey.

Campbell made his international debut as a substitute against Hungary on 18 May 1996. Although he had only one cap by the time Terry Venables selected his squad for UEFA Euro 1996, 21-year-old Campbell made the squad as defensive cover. He won his second cap in England&#x27;s 2–0 group stage match against Scotland, again as a substitute.
Over the next two years, under new manager Glenn Hoddle, Campbell became a regular member of England&#x27;s defence, partnering Gareth Southgate and Tony Adams. On 29 May 1998, aged 23 years and 248 days, Campbell became England&#x27;s second-youngest captain after Bobby Moore in a 0–0 draw against Belgium, though Michael Owen subsequently overtook Campbell after captaining England against Paraguay in April 2002. Campbell started all four of England&#x27;s matches in the 1998 World Cup.

During the 1998 World Cup, Campbell was involved in a highly controversial incident in England&#x27;s second round clash against Argentina. With less than ten minutes to play, the score was 2–2 and England were down to ten men after David Beckham was sent off. Campbell headed a corner into the Argentine net and wheeled away to celebrate his first international goal, which appeared to be the winning goal which would have put England into the quarter finals. However, the referee disallowed the goal after ruling that Alan Shearer had illegally contacted the goalkeeper, and England eventually lost the match on penalties.

Campbell was England&#x27;s first-choice centre back throughout the successful qualification campaign for Euro 2000 under new boss Kevin Keegan, and played in all three group games at the tournament, which England exited after defeat by Romania.

After the retirement of Tony Adams, Campbell partnered Rio Ferdinand in England&#x27;s successful qualification campaign for the 2002 World Cup, held in Korea and Japan. He scored his only senior international goal at the tournament, a header off a corner kick by Beckham in the opening group game against Sweden. The match ended 1–1, but in their next match, England defeated Argentina 1–0. Campbell&#x27;s partnership with Ferdinand was an integral part of a strong defensive performance throughout the tournament, and he was the only England player to be named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. England progressed to the quarter-finals, where they lost to eventual winners Brazil despite playing the last 30 minutes against ten men.

Campbell maintained his place in the centre of defence as he took part in England&#x27;s successful qualification campaign for Euro 2004. England went on to reach the quarter-finals clash with hosts Portugal, and with the score tied at 1–1, Campbell won a header in the opposition six-yard box to score what seemed to be a late winner for England. However, referee Urs Meier decided that John Terry had pushed Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo and instead gave a free-kick. The game ended 2–2 after extra time, and England lost the penalty shoot-out.

Campbell continued to play for England after Euro 2004, although his place in the international team had become less secure since the emergence of the central defensive partnership of Terry and Ferdinand, which blossomed during Campbell&#x27;s period of absence with injury in 2005. He was named in England&#x27;s squad for the 2006 World Cup, but was third-choice centre back, with coach Sven-Göran Eriksson preferring the partnership of Ferdinand and Terry. However, after a knock to Ferdinand, Campbell came on as a substitute in England&#x27;s group match against Sweden, which made him the first player to represent England on the pitch at six consecutive international tournaments. After Eriksson&#x27;s resignation, new coach Steve McClaren chose to look elsewhere for central defensive strength and Campbell was dropped for his first match in charge against Greece in August 2006.

After injuries to Ledley King, Jonathan Woodgate and Michael Dawson, along with Jamie Carragher retiring from international football, Campbell was recalled to the national team. He played four matches under McClaren as England&#x27;s qualification campaign failed.

New head coach Fabio Capello did not select Campbell for his first squad in January 2008. Campbell enjoyed a fine run of form on his return to Arsenal and had retained hope of making it to England&#x27;s squad for the 2010 World Cup, which would have been his fourth outing on the world stage along with a record seventh major tournament for his country. However, he was not named in Capello&#x27;s 30-man preliminary squad, with the coach opting instead for Carragher and King among others as potential defensive cover for Ferdinand and Terry.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the best English centre backs of his generation, Campbell was a strong, athletic and imposing defender, with a good positional sense, and was also a strong tackler. Due to his height and physical power, he excelled in the air, both offensively and defensively, although he initially had to work hard to improve his heading ability during his teenage years. He did not possess good natural stamina, but had pace, power, agility and quick feet, as well as significant mental strength. Due to his versatility and range of skills, as well as his ability to carry the ball out of defence and get forward, he was also capable of playing as a right back on occasion. However, despite being fairly comfortable in possession, he frequently drew criticism throughout his career for his poor distribution.

==Managerial career==
On 30 January 2017, Campbell was named as Dennis Lawrence&#x27;s assistant manager, after the latter was appointed manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team.

===Macclesfield Town===
Campbell was appointed manager of Macclesfield Town on 27 November 2018, then bottom of League Two and five points adrift of safety. Under Campbell, Macclesfield finished 22nd in League Two, three points above the bottom two relegation places. They stayed up on the last day of the season with a 1–1 draw with Cambridge United. He oversaw eight wins and 12 draws in his 30 games in charge. It was announced on 15 August 2019 that Campbell would be leaving the financially troubled club, by mutual agreement. In December 2019, Campbell backed a HM Revenue and Customs bid to wind-up the club, claiming to be owed £180,000.

===Southend United===
On 22 October 2019, Campbell was appointed manager of EFL League One club Southend United. Campbell watched his new side lose 7–1 to Doncaster Rovers before taking charge for his first game — a 3–1 home defeat to Ipswich Town. On 18 January 2020, Southend won their second game under Campbell with a 2–1 victory away at Accrington Stanley, the club&#x27;s first league win since September 2019. However, financial constraints prevented Campbell from signing any new players during the January 2020 transfer window. In June 2020, the season was ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England. At the time Southend were second from bottom in League One, 16 points from safety. Following a decision not to restart the season, Southend were relegated to League Two. Campbell left the club on 30 June 2020.

==Political views==

After his retirement from football, Campbell became increasingly vocal about British politics. In 2013, he said he liked &quot;the mentality of Labour but the policies of the Conservatives&quot;. In 2014, he criticised Ed Miliband&#x27;s proposals for a mansion tax on properties worth over £2 million, calling it &quot;madness&quot;.

Campbell said in 2014 that he was considering joining the Conservative Party and would be interested in helping the party gain more of &quot;the black vote&quot;. In February 2015, he confirmed his intention to run for the party&#x27;s nomination for Mayor of London in the 2016 election. In the list of four candidates chosen in July 2015, Campbell was not shortlisted.

Prior to the 2015 United Kingdom general election, Campbell featured in a poster for Operation Black Vote in which his skin was artificially whitened, with the words &quot;If you don’t register to vote, you’re taking the colour out of Britain&quot;. During the 2016 referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain a member of, or leave, the European Union, Campbell supported Brexit.

Campbell has criticised the lack of racial diversity in The Football Association (&quot;FA&quot;), and he made newspaper headlines in March 2014 after claiming that institutional racism on the part of the FA meant he was never chosen to captain the England team during his playing career. Campbell had been named as starting captain for England in a friendly against the United States in May 2005 under Sven-Göran Eriksson.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Campbell began dating interior designer Fiona Barratt, the granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. They married in Corbridge, Northumberland, on 17 July 2010. He has a son from a previous relationship with Janet Tyler.

Campbell had homes in London and at Hallington Hall at Hallington in Northumberland. In December 2015, Hallington Hall was put up for sale for just under £6 million after being totally renovated.

===Charitable work===
In 2009, Campbell launched his charity &quot;Kids go live&quot; which allows inner city children to see a variety of live sporting events such as Wimbledon, the Olympic Games and rugby internationals.

<text>Castles are buildings that combine fortifications and residence, and many were built within the borders of modern Scotland. They arrived in Scotland with the introduction of feudalism in the twelfth century. Initially these were wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, but many were replaced by stone castles with a high curtain wall. During the Wars of Independence, Robert the Bruce pursued a policy of castle slighting. In the Late Middle Ages, new castles were built, some on a grander scale as &quot;livery and maintenance&quot; castles that could support a large garrison. Gunpowder weaponry led to the use of gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls adapted to resist bombardment.

Many of the late Medieval castles built in the borders were in the form of tower houses, smaller pele towers or simpler bastle houses. From the fifteenth century there was a phase of Renaissance palace building, which restructured them as castle-type palaces, beginning at Linlithgow. Elements of Medieval castles, royal palaces and tower houses were used in the construction of Scots baronial estate houses, which were built largely for comfort, but with a castle-like appearance. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the military significance of castles declined, but they increasingly became tourist attractions. Elements of the Scots Baronial style would be revived from the late eighteenth century and the trend would be confirmed in popularity by the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle in the nineteenth century and its adoption as a retreat by Queen Victoria. In the twentieth century there were only isolated examples of new castle-influenced houses. Many tower houses were renovated, and many castles were taken over by the National Trust for Scotland or Historic Scotland and are open to the public.

==Middle Ages==

Castles, in the sense of a fortified residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as a consequence of the centralising of royal authority in the twelfth century. Prior to the 1120s there is very little evidence of castles having existed in Scotland, which had remained less politically centralised than in England with the north still ruled by the kings of Norway. David I of Scotland (r. 1124–53) spent time at the court of Henry I of England, becoming Earl of Huntingdon, and returned to Scotland with the intention of extending royal power across the country and modernising Scotland&#x27;s military technology, including the introduction of castles. The Scottish king encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle in Scotland, introducing a feudal mode of landholding and the use of castles as a way of controlling the contested Scottish Lowlands. Historian Lise Hull has suggested that the creation of castles in Scotland was &quot;less to do with conquest&quot; and more to do with &quot;establishing a governing system&quot;.

These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large, such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan. In England many of these constructions were converted into stone &quot;keep-and-bailey&quot; castles in the twelfth century, but in Scotland most of those that were in continued occupation became stone castles of &quot;enceinte&quot; from the thirteenth century, with a high embattled curtain wall. The need for thick and high walls for defence forced the use of economic building methods, often continuing the Scottish tradition of dry-stone rubble building, which were then covered with a lime render, or harled for weatherproofing and a uniform appearance. In addition to the baronial castles there were royal castles, often larger and providing defence, lodging for the itinerant Scottish court and a local administrative center. By 1200 these included fortifications at Ayr and Berwick. In Scotland Alexander II (r. 1198–1249) and Alexander III (1241–86) undertook a number of castle building projects in the modern style. Alexander III&#x27;s early death sparked conflict in Scotland and English intervention under Edward I in 1296. The resulting Wars of Independence brought this phase of castle building to an end and began a new phase of siege warfare.
The first recorded siege in Scotland was the 1230 siege of Rothesay Castle where the besieging Norwegians were able to break down the relatively weak stone walls with axes after only three days. When Edward I invaded Scotland he brought with him the siege capabilities that had evolved south of the border, resulting in the rapid fall of major castles. Edinburgh Castle fell within three days, and Roxburgh, Jedburgh, Dunbar, Stirling, Lanark and Dumbarton castles all surrendered to the English king. Subsequent English sieges, such as the attacks on Bothwell and Stirling, again used considerable resources including giant siege engines and extensive teams of miners and masons. As a result, Robert the Bruce (r. 1306–29) adopted a policy of castle destruction (known as slighting), rather than allow fortresses to be easily retaken and then held by the English, beginning with his own castles at Ayr and Dumfries, and including Roxburgh and Edinburgh. After the Wars of Independence, new castles began to be built, often on a grander scale as &quot;livery and maintenance&quot; castles, to house retained troops, like Tantallon, Lothian and Doune near Stirling, rebuilt for Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany in the fourteenth century.

Early gunpowder weapons were introduced to Scotland by the 1330s. The new technology began to be installed in Scottish castles by the 1380s, beginning with Edinburgh. In the fifteenth century, gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture. Existing castles were adapted to allow the use of the new weapons by the incorporation of &quot;keyhole&quot; gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls that were adapted to resist bombardment. Ravenscraig, Kirkcaldy, begun about 1460, is probably the first castle in the British Isles to be built as an artillery fort, incorporating &quot;D-shape&quot; bastions that would better resist cannon fire and on which artillery could be mounted. It also used &quot;letter box&quot; gun-ports, common in mainland Europe, although rarer in England, they rapidly spread across the kingdom. Scotland also led the way in adopting the new caponier design for castle ditches, as constructed at Craignethan Castle.

==Tower houses==
The largest number of late Medieval fortifications in Scotland built by nobles, about 800, were of the tower house design. Smaller versions of tower houses in southern Scotland were known as peel towers, or pele houses. The defences of tower houses were primarily aimed to provide protection against smaller raiding parties and were not intended to put up significant opposition to an organised military assault. This has led historian Stuart Reid to characterise them as &quot;defensible rather than defensive&quot;. They were typically a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building. They were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn, a walled courtyard designed to hold valuable animals securely, but not necessarily intended for serious defence. They were built extensively on both sides of the border with England from the fourteenth century. James IV&#x27;s (1488–1513) forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in 1494 led to an additional burst of tower building across the region. A number were also built in Scottish towns.

An option for small landholders and farmers was the bastle house, a form of fortified house that combined the functions of a tower house and a barmkyn. They were usually two-storey houses with the ground floor acting as a byre into which animals could be driven, while the living space on the upper floor could only be reached by a removable ladder. Most are within of the border and were built around the turn of the sixteenth century.

==Renaissance palaces==
An extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces probably began under James III (r. 1460–88) and accelerated under James IV, reaching its peak under James V (r. 1513–42). They used exceptional one-off revenues, such as the forfeiture of key lands, to establish their power across their kingdom in various ways including constructing grander castles by extending and modifying existing fortifications. These works have been seen as directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles. Linlithgow was first constructed under James I, under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country, from 1429. This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace of a &quot;palatium ad moden castri&quot; (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery and using harling to give them a clean, Italian appearance. There is evidence of Italian masons working for James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions. According to architectural historian John Dunbar, the results were the &quot;earliest examples of coherent Renaissance design in Britain&quot;.

The shift in architectural focus reflected changing political alliances, as James V had formed a close alliance with France during his reign. He encountered the French version of Renaissance building while visiting for his marriage to Madeleine of Valois in 1536 and his second marriage to Mary of Guise may have resulted in longer term connections and influences. Work from his reign largely disregarded the insular style adopted in England under Henry VIII and adopted forms that were recognisably European, beginning with the extensive work at Linlithgow. This was followed by re-buildings at Holyrood, Falkland, Stirling and Edinburgh, described by Roger Maison as &quot;some of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture in Britain&quot;.

Much of this castle rebuilding was planned and financed by James Hamilton of Finnart (c. 1495–1540), in addition to his work at Blackness Castle, Rothesay Castle, the house at Crawfordjohn, the &quot;New Inn&quot; in the St Andrews Cathedral Priory and the lodging at Balmerino Abbey for the ailing Queen Madeleine. Rather than slavishly copying continental forms, most Scottish architecture incorporated elements of these styles into traditional local patterns, adapting them to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl). Similar themes can be seen in the private houses of aristocrats, as in Mar&#x27;s Wark, Stirling (c. 1570) and Crichton Castle, built for the Earl of Bothwell in 1580s.

==Sixteenth and seventeenth centuries==
In the period of French intervention in the 1540s and 1550s, at the end of the Rough Wooing, Scotland was given a defended border of a series of earthwork forts and additions to existing castles. These included the erection of single bastions at Edinburgh, Stirling and Dunbar.

The unique style of great private houses in Scotland, later known as Scots baronial, has been located in origin to the period of the 1560s. It kept many of the features of the high walled Medieval castles that had been largely made obsolete by gunpowder weapons and may have been influenced by the French masons brought to Scotland to work on royal palaces. It drew on the tower houses and peel towers, with their parapets, corbels, and bartizans. The new estate houses built from the late sixteenth century by nobles and lairds were primarily built for comfort, not for defence, although they were often called castles. They retained many of these external features which had become associated with nobility, but with a larger ground plan. This was classically a &quot;Z-plan&quot; of a rectangular block with towers, as at Colliston Castle (1583) and Claypotts Castle (1569–88). The internal layout included a sequence of rooms of increasing privacy. The hall was often on the first floor. When used for dining, the owner of the castle sat at the top table or &quot;high board&quot;. Beyond the hall, a more private room, often a bed chamber, was known as the &quot;chamber of dais&quot;, and had feudal connotations. The term appears in inventories, and in legal records. In 1601, James Wood broke into his father&#x27;s castle at Bonnyton in Angus, intent on stealing legal documents from a chest in the chamber of dais. Larger castles had further bed chambers, sometimes in a vertical jamb or wing, and a gallery at attic level for family leisure.

Particularly influential was the work of William Wallace, the king&#x27;s master mason from 1617 until his death in 1631. He worked on the rebuilding of the collapsed North Range of Linlithgow from 1618, Winton House for George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton and began work on Heriot&#x27;s Hospital, Edinburgh. He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan like that used at Château d&#x27;Ancy-le-Franc. This style can be seen in lord&#x27;s houses built at Caerlaverlock (1620), Moray House, Edinburgh (1628) and Drumlanrig Castle (1675–89), and was highly influential until the baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with Inigo Jones in the later seventeenth century, which were used to produce classically inspired and comfortable country houses.

==Decline==

In 1603 James VI of Scotland inherited the crown of England, bringing a period of peace between the two countries. The royal court left for London, and as a result – with the exceptions of occasional visits – building work on royal castles north of the border largely ceased. Some castles continued to have modest military utility into the eighteenth century. The royal castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton and Stirling, along with Dunstaffnage, Dunollie, Blackness and Ruthven Castle, continued in use as practical fortifications. Tower houses were being built up until the 1640s. After the Restoration the fortified tower house fell out of fashion, but the weak state of the Scottish economy was such that, while many larger properties were simply abandoned, the more modest castles continued to be used and adapted as houses, rather than rebuilt.

In the Bishop&#x27;s Wars castles that held out for the king against the Covenanters, including Caerlaverock and Threave in 1640, were slighted, with their roofs removed and walls breached to make them uninhabitable. Tantallon was used as a base for Scottish attacks on Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s advancing army in 1651. As a result, it was pounded into submission by the New Model Army&#x27;s siege train, losing its end towers and ceasing to be a residence from that point. The sequence of Jacobite risings from 1689 threatened the Crown in Scotland, culminating in the rebellion in 1745. Stirling was able to withstand the Jacobite attack in 1745 and the siege of Blair Castle, at the end of the rebellion in 1746, was the final castle siege to occur in the British Isles. In the aftermath of the conflict Corgaff and many others castles were used as barracks for the forces sent to garrison the Highlands. Kildrummy, Huntly and Doune were destroyed as a result of their part in the rebellion.

From the late eighteenth century, castles became tourist attractions. Blair Castle was a popular location on account of its landscaped gardens, and Stirling Castle because of its romantic historic connections. Tours became increasingly popular during the nineteenth century, usually starting at Edinburgh and then spending up to two weeks further north, taking advantage of the expanding rail and steamer network. Blair Castle remained popular, but additional castles joined the circuit, with Cawdor Castle becoming popular once the railway line reached north to Fort William. Scottish castle guidebooks became well known for providing long historical accounts of their sites, often drawing on the plots of Romantic novels for the details. Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novels set in Scotland popularised several northern castles, including Tantallon, which was featured in the poem &quot;Marmion&quot; (1808).

==Gothic Revival==
In Scotland there was a revival of the castle in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and existing buildings remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam&#x27;s houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style.

Important for the adoption of the revival in the early nineteenth century was Abbotsford House, the residence of Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–76), Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929) and in urban contexts, including the building of Cockburn Street in Edinburgh (from the 1850s) as well as the National Wallace Monument at Stirling (1859–69). The rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace and its adoption as a royal retreat from 1855 to 1858 confirmed the popularity of the style. Scots Baronial architects frequently &quot;improved&quot; existing castles: Floors Castle was transformed in 1838 by William Playfair who added grand turrets and cupolas. The style spread south and the architect Edward Blore added a Scots Baronial touch to his work at Windsor.

==Twentieth century to the present==

The Baronial style peaked towards the end of the nineteenth century, and the building of large houses declined in importance in the twentieth century. It continued to influence the construction of some estate houses, including Skibo Castle, which was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. There was a lull in building after the First World War, and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses. Isolated examples of &quot;castles&quot; include houses that combine modern and traditional elements, such as Basil Spence&#x27;s Broughton Place (1936) and Glenskirlie Castle, Stirlingshire (2007).

Restoration of castles began in the early twentieth century, with projects including the renovation of Duart Castle on Mull, and the complete reconstruction of Eilean Donan from a few fragments of masonry. The restoration movement grew after World War II with a fashion for renovating tower houses, including Oliver Hill&#x27;s restoration of Inchdrewer Castle, near Banff in Aberdeenshire, in 1965. The restoration of tower houses and smaller castles continues, with recent examples including Fenton Tower in Lothian and Ballone Castle near Portmahomack. Historic Scotland have launched a &quot;Scottish Castle Initiative&quot; aimed at encouraging private investment in the restoration of Scotland&#x27;s castles, including a register of potential restoration candidates. Despite these efforts, a number of castles remain on Scotland&#x27;s Buildings at Risk Register.

Most of Scotland&#x27;s castles, whether ruined or occupied, remain in private ownership, though many are open to the public at least occasionally. During the twentieth century a number of older castles were transferred into the care of the state, and these are now the responsibility of Historic Scotland, which was created as an agency in 1991. Historic Scotland cares for over 300 properties – all of which are publicly accessible – including around 65 castles. These include some of Scotland&#x27;s most famous castles including Edinburgh and Stirling, as well as numerous tower houses and ruined castles. The National Trust for Scotland (founded 1931) cares for several post-Medieval castles and estate houses, including Culzean and Craigievar that were still in occupation until the twentieth century. The Landmark Trust restores and operates historic buildings as holiday homes, including Saddell Castle, Castle of Park and Roslin Castle. Several other castles are in the hands of local government, for example Dudhope Castle in Dundee, and some are maintained by building preservation trusts and other charitable bodies, for example Sauchie Tower, Clackmannanshire.

<text>Jacob Salwyn Schapiro (December 19, 1879 – December 30, 1973) was a Professor Emeritus of History at the City College of New York.

==Work==
In his book, &quot;Liberalism and the Challenge of Fascism&quot;, Schapiro set out to discuss the changes in both England and France. Schapiro contrasted the smooth evolution of liberalism in England to the violent swings back and forth between reaction and liberal forces in France. This historical violent dialectic in France, in Schapiro&#x27;s argument, was what created the basic ideas of Nazism.

Schapiro&#x27;s Definition of Fascism
:&quot;It would be a great error to regard fascism as a counterrevolutionary movement directed against the communists, as was that of the reactionaries against the liberals during the first half of the nineteenth century. Fascism is something unique in modern history, in that it is a &quot;revolutionary&quot; movement of the middle class directed, on the one hand, against the great banks and big business and, on the other hand, against the revolutionary demands of the working class. It repudiates democracy as a political system in which the bankers, capitalists, and socialists find free scope for their activities, and it favors a dictatorship that will eliminate these elements from the life of the nation. Fascism proclaims a body of doctrines that are not entirely new; there are no &quot;revelations&quot; in history.&quot;

One thinker whose views Schapiro felt were proto-fascist was French anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865). This interpretation of Proudhon&#x27;s philosophy was strongly challenged by Italian activist and author Nicola Chiaromonte, however.

<text>OmniGraffle is a diagramming and digital illustration application for macOS and iOS created by The Omni Group.

== Uses ==
OmniGraffle is used to create graphics and visuals. The application features several design tools, along with a drag-and-drop WYSIWYG interface and a notes function that annotate and create specification documentation for prototypes and mockups.

While OmniGraffle can produce graphics and visuals, it is often used as a tool to create content maps, screen flows, and wireframes. Visuals are often referred to as &quot;graffles.&quot;

== Application resources and tools ==
OmniGraffle design tools include canvases, templates, stencils, vector drawings, and grid guides. Other features include auto layout and document management.

;Canvases: Canvases are spaces where users can create shapes. Attributes to creating a canvas include canvas name, sizing options, grid and dimension selections, and diagram layout. Users may create and also share canvases and layers, with automatic updates available. This gives users the option to create layers once, toggle layers to appear on desired canvases, and update automatically if any changes occur.

;Templates : Templates are OmniGraffle application resources. Template documents can be manipulated by users for their purposes. Some sample templates are preloaded and available for users. Users may also create, edit, and save templates for creating consistent graffles.

;Stencils : Stencils are OmniGraffle application resources. Stencils are clip art files that serve as elements, such as icons or buttons, for OmniGraffle documents. Users can also create, share, download, and preview stencils online as well through OmniGraffle&#x27;s Stenciltown or other stencil libraries, such as Graffletopia.

OmniGraffle documents are vectorial, and the app includes vector design tools.

OmniGraffle supports &quot;smart guides&quot; and snap-to-grid for object alignment. Other design features include artistic fill and stroke styles, text and shape scalability, path-following text, shape combinations, diagram styling, auto layout features for tree mapping, and documentation management.

OmniGraffle can be automated using OmniJS (a Javascript programming environment).

== Import and export ==
OmniGraffle supports file sharing and Visio support in its Pro distribution. All users can export their graffles to JPEG, BMP, EPS, GIF, HTML Images, SVG, Template, Stencil, PNG, OO3, TIFF, and PDF. Additionally, OmniGraffle Pro users can import dot/graphviz, Visio, SVG, PDF, Photoshop with layers, and Xcode.

== Competition ==
In many respects, OmniGraffle is similar to Microsoft Visio. The Pro version of OmniGraffle can both import and export Visio files created using Visio&#x27;s XML export function. However, Omnigraffle doesn&#x27;t provide CAD integration like Visio, since it lacks some features such as DWG or DXF (Autodesk file formats), import/export functions, among others. Also it is important to notice that layers cannot be shared among some versions of Visio and OmniGraffle.

Diagrams such as concept maps or mind maps, flowcharts and wire frames can also be drawn with other applications: see Comparison of vector graphics editors.

<doc id="753216" wikidata="Q5608924" url="?curid=753216" title="Griffith Stadium">
<text>Griffith Stadium stood in Washington, D.C., from 1911 to 1965, between Georgia Avenue and 5th Street (left field), and between W Street and Florida Avenue NW.

The site was once home to a wooden baseball park. Built in 1891, it was called Boundary Field, or National Park after the team that played there: the Washington Senators/Nationals. It was destroyed by a fire in 1911.

It was replaced by a steel and concrete structure, at first called National Park and then American League Park; it was renamed Clark Griffith Stadium for Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith in 1923. The stadium was home to the American League Senators from 1911 through 1960, and to an expansion team of the same name for their first season in 1961.

The venue hosted the All-Star Game in 1937 and 1956 and World Series games in 1924, 1925, and 1933. It served as home for the Negro league Homestead Grays during the 1940s, when it hosted the Negro World Series in 1943 and 1944. Griffith was also home to the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) for 24 seasons, from the time they transferred from Boston in 1937 through the 1960 season.

The ballpark was demolished in 1965; the site is now occupied by Howard University Hospital.

==Early history==
On March 17, 1911, Boundary Field, also known as National Park and American League Park (II), was destroyed by a fire started by a plumber&#x27;s blowtorch. This left the owners of the Washington Senators in a difficult situation, since spring training had already begun and opening day was less than a month away. Thomas C. Noyes, president of the Senators, gained approval from the club&#x27;s board of directors to build a new ballpark with a steel grandstand on the same site as Boundary Field. The quick construction of the ballpark was reported by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;Day and night the chanting of the negro laborers has been heard in the vicinity, like Aladdin&#x27;s palace, the structure rose as if by magic.&quot; Opening Day 1911, the grandstand was sufficiently stable to host President William Howard Taft and the Boston Red Sox, as well as 16,000 fans. Construction of Griffith Stadium continued while the Senators were on the road, and was not completed until July 24, 1911.

==Field design==

The stadium was laid out at an angle within its block in the Washington street grid. Thus it was over down the left field line (east) to the bleachers (though this distance was shortened in later years by the construction of an inner fence). The fence also took an unusual right-angled jut into right-center field where a large tree and five houses stood, due to the unwillingness of the owners of the tree and houses to sell to the Senators&#x27; owners during construction of the stadium.

The right-field fence angled away from the infield sharply, which, in addition to a fence (to block the view from surrounding buildings) about inside the lower, outer wall, meant that relatively few home runs were hit at the stadium. The field&#x27;s orientation was unorthodox, as center field was east-southeast of home plate, which made for difficult visibility for the fielders in the late afternoon sun; recommended alignment is east-northeast. The elevation of the natural grass playing field was approximately above sea level.

The Senators&#x27; groundskeepers maintained a downhill slope from home plate to first base, supposedly to help accelerate slow Washington batters. However, Griffith&#x27;s groundskeepers were still adept at keeping a fine sod field that was &quot;compared to that of the best golf courses.&quot; This was in sharp contrast to the unkempt field that can be seen in photographs of Griffith prior to 1923. For many years, the right field grandstand wall served as the right-field foul line for the last before the foul pole, making it impossible to catch a ball there. The tall, hand-operated scoreboard in right-center was in play, as was the National Bohemian beer sign, shaped like a bottle, above the playing field. At one point in his youth, future MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was the operator of the scoreboard.

The outfield seats (in fair territory) in left and center field butted up against 5th Street. The football field ran along the third base line.

===Expansion and changes===
In the early 1920s, a trend began of fans flocking in great numbers to the stadium to see baseball&#x27;s rising stars from opposing teams; when the New York Yankees came to Washington, the chance to see Babe Ruth brought large crowds to the ballpark. Clark Griffith took advantage of this trend by making small improvements in the stadium in 1920 and 1921. These improvements included changing the main entrance of the park from Georgia Avenue to a refurbished one on Florida Avenue and spending $3,200 to build an office for himself beneath the grandstand. After various other small improvements, on August 21, 1923, Griffith announced plans to greatly expand and refurbish the ballpark. Following the trend of ballparks being named for their teams&#x27; owners, that August announcement included renaming the venue Clark Griffith Stadium. The stadium, built in 1911, had been hastily constructed and provided minimal seating and other features when compared with other ballparks. The planned expansion was reported to cost $100,000, and expanded the seating capacity to &quot;about 35,000&quot;, a number that wound up being 32,000. The new seating came from the complete rebuilding of the left-field grandstand into a double-decked tier. The new upper section was wider than the old, resulting in a roofline that was considerably higher than the roof of the main grandstand, leaving a visible gap between the two. At that point the wooden left-field bleachers were also replaced by a large concrete deck that ran from the foul pole across left field and into center field. The first-base pavilion remained single-decked. The first attempt at a high wall was constructed across right field.

By the time of the 1925 World Series the right field pavilion had also been double-decked, and the angling right field wall and its scoreboard were reconstructed to align with the low right field wall, about inside of it. This also resulted in the unique inward-pointing 90° angle in center field. Both versions of the tall fence had the effect of keeping the neighbors in the adjacent row houses from watching the games for free.

Lights were installed for the 1941 season. The Senators played their first home night game on May 28.

The right-field fence was originally covered in various billboard advertisements, but in later years was painted a solid dark green. A bullpen area was built in right center field behind a short fence, providing a new target for left-handed batters. In the mid-1950s, an inner fence was erected across left and center field, to reduce the home run distances by . This inner fence stayed in place through the ballpark&#x27;s final season, 1961. By 1961, the left-field bleachers had been removed.

==A presidential destination==
Every president of the United States from William Howard Taft to John F. Kennedy threw a ceremonial first pitch at least once at Griffith. The Senators even constructed a special presidential box near the first-base dugout for the annual ritual.

Franklin D. Roosevelt was a good friend of Clark Griffith, and had attended games at the stadium since his days as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the 1910s. When FDR returned to Washington in 1933 as president, Griffith visited the White House early every season to give Roosevelt season passes; he also constructed a special ramp at the ballpark that accommodated the president&#x27;s special mobility needs after his bout with polio in 1921. On Opening Day 1941, Roosevelt stood up in the stadium&#x27;s presidential box on the arm of a military aide, and threw out the first pitch. In 1942, Griffith urged Roosevelt to keep baseball going during the war, and took credit for doing so after Roosevelt&#x27;s initial &quot;Green Light letter&quot;, which allowed baseball to continue.

==Notable sluggers==

For most of its existence, Griffith Stadium was known as a pitcher&#x27;s park. For instance, the left-field foul line was never less than 350 feet from the plate, and right field was never less than 320 feet. The distant fences were no problem for sluggers like Josh Gibson, Mickey Mantle, and the Senators&#x27; own youngster Harmon Killebrew. There have been only three reported instances of a player hitting a home run &quot;over&quot; the left field bleachers: Mantle once and Gibson twice. Clark Griffith once said that Gibson hit more home runs into Griffith Stadium&#x27;s distant left-field bleachers than the entire American League. Babe Ruth hit near-500-foot drives over the center field and right-center field walls on consecutive days in May 1921.

In May 1949, Cleveland Indians outfielder Larry Doby smacked the then-longest home run ever hit at the stadium over the right-center field wall and onto a rooftop well outside the ballpark. The shot was reported to have traveled over , and Doby called it &quot;the longest homer I&#x27;ve ever hit&quot;.

On April 17, 1953, Mantle hit a home run off Chuck Stobbs that was so impressive that someone tried to determine its flight with some accuracy, thus popularizing the term &quot;tape measure home run&quot;. It was alleged to be , although it bounced off the top of the back wall of the bleachers, adding some distance to its flight path. It was believed to be the 2nd longest home run ever hit at the time.

Aside from some championship seasons in the early 1920s and 1930s, the Senators teams that played at Griffith Stadium were legendarily bad. The hapless Washington team became the butt of a well-known vaudeville joke: &quot;First in war, first in peace, and last in the American League&quot;, a twist on the famous Henry &quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee eulogy of George Washington: &quot;First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen&quot; (a similar phrasing was once used for the St. Louis Browns: &quot;First in shoes, first in booze, and last in the American League.&quot;)

Only one Washington, D.C., public high school baseball player ever hit a home run over the 30-foot-high &quot;green monster–like&quot; right field wall at Griffith Stadium—Bill Harrison of Coolidge High School in 1952.

In 1915, Joseph P. Derby hit a home run off the right field wall, and became the only known amateur baseball player believed to hit a ball completely out of Washington&#x27;s Griffith Stadium.

The stadium was still called Griffith Stadium in 1961, even though team owner Calvin Griffith had moved the original Senators club to the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis-St. Paul (becoming the Minnesota Twins), to be replaced in Washington by a new expansion team, also called the Senators (now the Texas Rangers).

==Football==

Griffith Stadium hosted numerous football events before the Redskins moved there in 1937. It was the home of Georgetown Hoyas football from 1921 until 1950, George Washington Colonials football from 1930 to 1960, and Maryland Terrapins football in 1948. The stadium was the host of an annual Thanksgiving Day game between Howard and Lincoln Universities, which was one of the most popular events during the year, drawing many African-American alumni and fans from the surrounding neighborhoods. One major reason for the stadium&#x27;s early-1920s expansion was that Clark Griffith had envisioned the stadium hosting the annual Army–Navy Game, played every December. Temporary seats were often placed in right field for football games at Griffith, with the gridiron stretching from left field to the first base line. The exceptional distance from home to the left-field area allowed plenty of room for the football field.

===Washington Redskins===
The Redskins, previously based in Boston and named for the Boston Braves, moved their home to D.C. in time for the 1937 season. As Boston, they had won their division in 1936 and continued their winning ways in Washington, capturing their first NFL championship in that first season. They continued as perennial contenders all through the war years.

Griffith Stadium was the location of 1940 and 1942 NFL Championship Games. The 1940 game was the 73–0 triumph by the Chicago Bears over the Redskins, the highest-scoring shutout game in the history of the NFL. The Championship Game in 1942 was essentially a rematch, with nearly the same players, and this time the Redskins upset the previously undefeated Bears, 14–6. According to Richard Whittingham&#x27;s history of the Chicago Bears (), George Preston Marshall, the owner of the Redskins, gave his team a pre-game pep talk that consisted simply of writing &quot;73–0&quot; on the chalkboard.

During the Redskins&#x27; game on the afternoon of December 7, 1941, against the Philadelphia Eagles, an announcement was made over Griffith Stadium&#x27;s public-address system commanding all of the American generals and admirals there to report to their duty stations. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was not explicitly announced over the P.A. system; with no small, portable radios available in the 1940s, that left thousands of other spectators to be among the last Americans to learn of the Japanese attack. The Redskins won that game, their last game of the 1941 season, 20–14. They finished the season with a record of six wins and five losses, in third place in the NFL Eastern Division. Although the Redskins enjoyed only one winning record at home (4–2 in 1956) during their final 13 seasons at Griffith, they still finished with an 81-58-6 overall record at the stadium over 24 seasons.

==Other events==
Griffith Stadium was home to many events other than baseball and football. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League played games there during the league&#x27;s existence. Over 180 boxing matches were held at the ballpark, including fights by Joe Louis. On July 23, 1942, a &quot;battle of music&quot; was held at Griffith between musicians Louis Armstrong and Charlie Barnet. Some of the 18,000 fans in attendance began to dance on the field in front of the bandstand. Spectators who remained in their seats complained that they could not see. When the police attempted to control the situation by stopping the music, a riot broke out, with some minor injuries and several teenagers being hauled away by the police.

Scrap metal salvage rallies were held at least once at the stadium during World War II, where people would bring scrap metal to the ballpark to be melted and made into steel for new weapons. Griffith was also the home to public school events, church revivals, public meetings, and annual ROTC drill competitions. Billy Graham held a crusade at Griffith in 1960, preaching from a platform erected near second base. Two choir stands, each accommodating 500 singers, were set up along the foul lines. Gospel&#x27;s first superstar, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, was married in Griffith Stadium in 1951 - in what was a legally binding PR stunt - in front of some 20,000 paying guests.

==Status in racial disputes==
Griffith Stadium was located in LeDroit Park, a historically black area of Washington since the Civil War. The neighborhood was home to many black working-class people, but also a class of young professional African-American &quot;elites&quot; including Langston Hughes. Duke Ellington worked at Griffith selling hot dogs during his childhood.

Griffith Stadium was not officially segregated, although an unofficial policy early after the 1920s expansion was that blacks sat in the right field pavilion. Calvin Griffith claimed that the segregated seats were a result of &quot;colored preachers ... asking Mr. Griffith to put aside a section for the black people.&quot;

Shortly after the end of World War I, after a report that several white women had been raped by a black man, a large group of whites seeking revenge marched toward the Shaw neighborhood. However, a conflict was avoided after these men came upon &quot;a group of two thousand armed black men&quot;, who had been prepared and gotten their weapons at Griffith Stadium, chosen as a meeting place because of its landmark status in the community.

Senators management, seemingly uneasy about racial matters, were latecomers to integrating their team, adding their first black player, outfielder Carlos Paula, in 1954 - 7 years after Jackie Robinson had debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers. The segregationist policy of the Redskins was more overt and controversial. In October 1957, a group of blacks picketed multiple times in front of Griffith Stadium, protesting the lack of black players on the team. It would be five more years, along with government intervention, before the Redskins finally began employing black players, the last NFL team to do so.

==Final years==

In 1955, longtime Senators owner Clark Griffith died, and his nephew, Calvin Griffith, took over. Fewer and fewer fans were coming to the ballpark, due in large part to the St. Louis Browns&#x27; move to Baltimore in 1954, which meant Baltimoreans no longer had to come to Washington to see games. Because of this, Calvin Griffith developed an interest in moving the Senators to Minnesota. Attendance may not have been the sole reason Griffith wanted to move, however; in a speech to Minnesota businessmen in the 1970s, Griffith said, &quot;You only have 15,000 blacks here&quot;.
The American League opposed a move at first, but agreed under the condition that an expansion team, also named the Senators, would come to Washington, beginning in 1961. The original Senators moved to Minnesota, and the new Senators played at Griffith in 1961. However, in 1962, the Senators moved to the new D.C. Stadium, joining the Redskins, who had moved there a year before. The final baseball game at Griffith Stadium was played on September 21, 1961, before a crowd of only 1,498 fans.

Griffith Stadium now had no tenants, and sat empty for years, deteriorating, with the field taking on the appearance of a prairie. In 1962, it was leased to Howard University which used it for student parking. In 1963, Congress authorized money for the purchase and clearing of the stadium and in 1964 it sold to Howard University for about $1.5 million. The ballpark was demolished in 1965. Nearly a thousand of the stadium&#x27;s seats were moved to Tinker Field in Orlando, Florida, at that time the spring training home of the Senators/Twins, where they remained until 2015 when that stadium was also demolished.

The Howard University Hospital now occupies the site. A marker has been placed in the building designating the location of home plate.

The expansion Senators remained in Washington through the 1971 season, then relocated to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and became the Texas Rangers in 1972.

<doc id="753225" wikidata="Q2858853" url="?curid=753225" title="Uses of trigonometry">
<text>Amongst the lay public of non-mathematicians and non-scientists, trigonometry is known chiefly for its application to measurement problems, yet is also often used in ways that are far more subtle, such as its place in the theory of music; still other uses are more technical, such as in number theory. The mathematical topics of Fourier series and Fourier transforms rely heavily on knowledge of trigonometric functions and find application in a number of areas, including statistics.

==Thomas Paine&#x27;s statement==

In Chapter XI of The Age of Reason, the American revolutionary and Enlightenment thinker Thomas Paine wrote: 

:&quot;The scientific principles that man employs to obtain the foreknowledge of an eclipse, or of any thing else relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies, are contained chiefly in that part of science that is called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle, which, when applied to the study of the heavenly bodies, is called astronomy; when applied to direct the course of a ship on the ocean, it is called navigation; when applied to the construction of figures drawn by a ruler and compass, it is called geometry; when applied to the construction of plans of edifices, it is called architecture; when applied to the measurement of any portion of the surface of the earth, it is called land-surveying. In fine, it is the soul of science. It is an eternal truth: it contains the &quot;mathematical demonstration&quot; of which man speaks, and the extent of its uses are unknown&quot;.

==History==

===Great Trigonometrical Survey===

From 1802 until 1871, the Great Trigonometrical Survey was a project to survey the Indian subcontinent with high precision. Starting from the coastal baseline, mathematicians and geographers triangulated vast distances across the country. One of the key achievements was measuring the height of Himalayan mountains, and determining that Mount Everest is the highest point on Earth. 

===Historical use for multiplication===

For the 25 years preceding the invention of the logarithm in 1614, prosthaphaeresis was the only known generally applicable way of approximating products quickly. It used the identities for the trigonometric functions of sums and differences of angles in terms of the products of trigonometric functions of those angles.

==Some modern uses==

Scientific fields that make use of trigonometry include:

:acoustics, architecture, astronomy, cartography, civil engineering, geophysics, crystallography, electrical engineering, electronics, land surveying and geodesy, many physical sciences, mechanical engineering, machining, medical imaging, number theory, oceanography, optics, pharmacology, probability theory, seismology, statistics, and visual perception

That these fields involve trigonometry does not mean knowledge of trigonometry is needed in order to learn anything about them. It &quot;does&quot; mean that &quot;some&quot; things in these fields cannot be understood without trigonometry. For example, a professor of music may perhaps know nothing of mathematics, but would probably know that Pythagoras was the earliest known contributor to the mathematical theory of music.

In &quot;some&quot; of the fields of endeavor listed above it is easy to imagine how trigonometry could be used. For example, in navigation and land surveying, the occasions for the use of trigonometry are in at least some cases simple enough that they can be described in a beginning trigonometry textbook. In the case of music theory, the application of trigonometry is related to work begun by Pythagoras, who observed that the sounds made by plucking two strings of different lengths are consonant if both lengths are small integer multiples of a common length. The resemblance between the shape of a vibrating string and the graph of the sine function is no mere coincidence. In oceanography, the resemblance between the shapes of some waves and the graph of the sine function is also not coincidental. In some other fields, among them climatology, biology, and economics, there are seasonal periodicities. The study of these often involves the periodic nature of the sine and cosine functions.

===Fourier series===

Many fields make use of trigonometry in more advanced ways than can be discussed in a single article. Often those involve what are called the Fourier series, after the 18th- and 19th-century French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier. Fourier series have a surprisingly diverse array of applications in many scientific fields, in particular in all of the phenomena involving seasonal periodicities mentioned above, and in wave motion, and hence in the study of radiation, of acoustics, of seismology, of modulation of radio waves in electronics, and of electric power engineering.

A Fourier series is a sum of this form:

: formula_1

where each of the squares (formula_2) is a different number, and one is adding infinitely many terms. Fourier used these for studying heat flow and diffusion (diffusion is the process whereby, when you drop a sugar cube into a gallon of water, the sugar gradually spreads through the water, a pollutant spreads through the air, or any dissolved substance spreads through any fluid).

Fourier series are also applicable to subjects whose connection with wave motion is far from obvious. One ubiquitous example is digital compression whereby images, audio and video data are compressed into a much smaller size which makes their transmission feasible over telephone, internet and broadcast networks. Another example, mentioned above, is diffusion. Among others are: the geometry of numbers, isoperimetric problems, recurrence of random walks, quadratic reciprocity, the central limit theorem, Heisenberg&#x27;s inequality.

===Fourier transforms===

A more abstract concept than Fourier series is the idea of Fourier transform. Fourier transforms involve integrals rather than sums, and are used in a similarly diverse array of scientific fields. Many natural laws are expressed by relating &quot;rates of change&quot; of quantities to the quantities themselves. For example: The rate population change is sometimes jointly proportional to (1) the present population and (2) the amount by which the present population falls short of the carrying capacity. This kind of relationship is called a differential equation. If, given this information, one tries to express population as a function of time, one is trying to &quot;solve&quot; the differential equation. Fourier transforms may be used to convert some differential equations to algebraic equations for which methods of solving them are known. Fourier transforms have many uses. In almost any scientific context in which the words spectrum, harmonic, or resonance are encountered, Fourier transforms or Fourier series are nearby.

===Statistics, including mathematical psychology===

Intelligence quotients are sometimes held to be distributed according to a bell-shaped curve. About 40% of the area under the curve is in the interval from 100 to 120; correspondingly, about 40% of the population scores between 100 and 120 on IQ tests. Nearly 9% of the area under the curve is in the interval from 120 to 140; correspondingly, about 9% of the population scores between 120 and 140 on IQ tests, etc. Similarly many other things are distributed according to the &quot;bell-shaped curve&quot;, including measurement errors in many physical measurements. Why the ubiquity of the &quot;bell-shaped curve&quot;? There is a theoretical reason for this, and it involves Fourier transforms and hence trigonometric functions. That is one of a variety of applications of Fourier transforms to statistics.

Trigonometric functions are also applied when statisticians study seasonal periodicities, which are often represented by Fourier series.

===Number theory===
There is a hint of a connection between trigonometry and number theory. Loosely speaking, one could say that number theory deals with qualitative properties rather than quantitative properties of numbers.

:formula_3

Discard the ones that are not in lowest terms; keep only those that are in lowest terms:

:formula_4

Then bring in trigonometry:

:formula_5

The value of the sum is −1, because 42 has an &quot;odd&quot; number of prime factors and none of them is repeated: 42 = 2 × 3 × 7. (If there had been an &quot;even&quot; number of non-repeated factors then the sum would have been 1; if there had been any repeated prime factors (e.g., 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5) then the sum would have been 0; the sum is the Möbius function evaluated at 42.) This hints at the possibility of applying Fourier analysis to number theory.

===Solving non-trigonometric equations===

Various types of equations can be solved using trigonometry.

For example, a linear difference equation or linear differential equation with constant coefficients has solutions expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of its characteristic equation; if some of the eigenvalues are complex, the complex terms can be replaced by trigonometric functions of real terms, showing that the dynamic variable exhibits oscillations.

Similarly, cubic equations with three real solutions have an algebraic solution that is unhelpful in that it contains cube roots of complex numbers; again an alternative solution exists in terms of trigonometric functions of real terms.

<text>In computational complexity theory, an alternating Turing machine (ATM) is a non-deterministic Turing machine (NTM) with a rule for accepting computations that generalizes the rules used in the definition of the complexity classes NP and co-NP. The concept of an ATM was set forth by Chandra and Stockmeyer and independently by Kozen in 1976, with a joint journal publication in 1981.

== Definitions ==

=== Informal description ===

The definition of NP uses the &quot;existential mode&quot; of computation: if &quot;any&quot; choice leads to an accepting state, then the whole computation accepts. The definition of co-NP uses the &quot;universal mode&quot; of computation: only if &quot;all&quot; choices lead to an accepting state does the whole computation accept. An alternating Turing machine (or to be more precise, the definition of acceptance for such a machine) alternates between these modes.

An alternating Turing machine is a non-deterministic Turing machine whose states are divided into two sets: existential states and universal states. An existential state is accepting if some transition leads to an accepting state; a universal state is accepting if every transition leads to an accepting state. (Thus a universal state with no transitions accepts unconditionally; an existential state with no transitions rejects unconditionally). The machine as a whole accepts if the initial state is accepting.

=== Formal definition ===

Formally, a (one-tape) alternating Turing machine is a 5-tuple formula_1 where
* formula_2 is the finite set of states
* formula_3 is the finite tape alphabet
* formula_4 is called the transition function (&quot;L&quot; shifts the head left and &quot;R&quot; shifts the head right)
* formula_5 is the initial state
* formula_6 specifies the type of each state

If &quot;M&quot; is in a state formula_7 with formula_8 then that configuration is said to be &quot;accepting&quot;, and if formula_9 the configuration is said to be &quot;rejecting&quot;. A configuration with formula_10 is said to be accepting if all configurations reachable in one step are accepting, and rejecting if some configuration reachable in one step is rejecting. A configuration with formula_11 is said to be accepting when there exists some configuration reachable in one step that is accepting and rejecting when all configurations reachable in one step are rejecting (this is the type of all states in a classical NTM except the final state). &quot;M&quot; is said to accept an input string &quot;w&quot; if the initial configuration of &quot;M&quot; (the state of &quot;M&quot; is formula_12, the head is at the left end of the tape, and the tape contains &quot;w&quot;) is accepting, and to reject if the initial configuration is rejecting.

Note that it is impossible for a configuration to be both accepting and rejecting, however, some configurations may be neither accepting or rejecting, due to the possibility of nonterminating computations.

=== Resource bounds ===

When deciding if a configuration of an ATM is accepting or rejecting using the above definition, it is not always necessary to examine all configurations reachable from the current configuration. In particular, an existential configuration can be labelled as accepting if any successor configuration is found to be accepting, and a universal configuration can be labelled as rejecting if any successor configuration is found to be rejecting.

An ATM decides a formal language in time formula_13 if, on any input of length , examining configurations only up to formula_13 steps is sufficient to label the initial configuration as accepting or rejecting. An ATM decides a language in space formula_15 if examining configurations that do not modify tape cells beyond the formula_15 cell from the left is sufficient.

A language that is decided by some ATM in time formula_17 for some constant formula_18 is said to be in the class formula_19, and a language decided in space formula_20 is said to be in the class formula_21.

== Example ==

Perhaps the most natural problem for alternating machines to solve is the quantified Boolean formula problem, which is a generalization of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which each variable can be bound by either an existential or a universal quantifier. The alternating machine branches existentially to try all possible values of an existentially quantified variable and universally to try all possible values of a universally quantified variable, in the left-to-right order in which they are bound. After deciding a value for all quantified variables, the machine accepts if the resulting Boolean formula evaluates to true, and rejects if it evaluates to false. Thus at an existentially quantified variable the machine is accepting if a value can be substituted for the variable that renders the remaining problem satisfiable, and at a universally quantified variable the machine is accepting if any value can be substituted and the remaining problem is satisfiable.

Such a machine decides quantified Boolean formulas in time formula_22 and space formula_23.

The Boolean satisfiability problem can be viewed as the special case where all variables are existentially quantified, allowing ordinary nondeterminism, which uses only existential branching, to solve it efficiently.

== Complexity classes and comparison to deterministic Turing machines ==

The following complexity classes are useful to define for ATMs:
* formula_24 are the languages decidable in polynomial time
* formula_25 are the languages decidable in polynomial space
* formula_26 are the languages decidable in exponential time

These are similar to the definitions of P, PSPACE, and EXPTIME, considering the resources used by an ATM rather than a deterministic Turing machine. Chandra, Kozen, and Stockmeyer proved the theorems
* ALOGSPACE = P
* AP = PSPACE
* APSPACE = EXPTIME
* AEXPTIME = EXPSPACE
* formula_27
* formula_28
* formula_29
when formula_30 and formula_31.

A more general form of these relationships is expressed by the parallel computation thesis.

== Bounded alternation ==

===Definition===

An alternating Turing machine with &quot;k&quot; alternations is an alternating Turing machine that switches from an existential to a universal state or vice versa no more than &quot;k&quot;−1 times. (It is an alternating Turing machine whose states are divided into &quot;k&quot; sets. The states in even-numbered sets are universal and the states in odd-numbered sets are existential (or vice versa). The machine has no transitions between a state in set &quot;i&quot; and a state in set &quot;j&quot; &lt; &quot;i&quot;.)

formula_32 is the class of languages decidable in time formula_33 by a machine beginning in an existential state and alternating at most formula_34 times. It is called the th level of the formula_35 hierarchy.

formula_36 is defined in the same way, but beginning in a universal state; it consists of the complements of the languages in formula_37.

formula_38 is defined similarly for space bounded computation.

=== Example ===
Consider the circuit minimization problem: given a circuit &quot;A&quot; computing a Boolean function &quot;f&quot; and a number &quot;n&quot;, determine if there is a circuit with at most &quot;n&quot; gates that computes the same function &quot;f&quot;. An alternating Turing machine, with one alternation, starting in an existential state, can solve this problem in polynomial time (by guessing a circuit &quot;B&quot; with at most &quot;n&quot; gates, then switching to a universal state, guessing an input, and checking that the output of &quot;B&quot; on that input matches the output of &quot;A&quot; on that input).

=== Collapsing classes ===
It is said that a hierarchy &quot;collapses&quot; to level if every language in level formula_39 of the hierarchy is in its level .

As a corollary of the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, the logarithmic space hierarchy collapses to its first level. As a corollary the formula_40 hierarchy collapses to its first level when formula_41 is space constructible.

===Special cases===
An alternating Turing machine in polynomial time with &quot;k&quot; alternations, starting in an existential (respectively, universal) state can decide all the problems in the class formula_42 (respectively, formula_43).
These classes are sometimes denoted formula_44 and formula_45, respectively.
See the polynomial hierarchy article for details.

Another special case of time hierarchies is the logarithmic hierarchy.

<text>The Napa River is a river approximately long in the U.S. state of California. It drains a famous wine-growing region called the Napa Valley, in the mountains north of the San Francisco Bay. Milliken Creek and Mt. Veeder watersheds are a few of its many tributaries. The river mouth is at Vallejo, where the intertidal zone of fresh and salt waters flow into the Carquinez Strait and the San Pablo Bay.

==Course==

The Napa River rises in northwestern Napa County just south of the summit of Mt. St. Helena in the Mayacamas Mountains of the California Coast Ranges. The source begins as seasonal Kimball Canyon Creek in Robert Louis Stevenson State Park at an elevation of which descends the southern slope of Mt. St. Helena to Kimball Canyon Dam.

It flows south for 4 miles (6 km), entering the head of the slender Napa Valley north of Calistoga. In the valley, it flows southeast past Calistoga, St Helena, Rutherford, Oakville and through Napa, its head of navigation. Downstream from Napa, it forms a tidal estuary, entering Mare Island Strait, a narrow channel on the north end of San Pablo Bay. It discharges into San Pablo Bay through the Napa Sonoma Marsh.

==Watershed==
The Napa River watershed encompasses approximately 426 square miles (1,103 km²). Larger tributaries, such as Dry, Conn, and Soda creeks, show signs of recent incision and have graded to the incised current level of the mainstem Napa River. In some cases, smaller tributaries cutting across the valley floor have not fully adjusted to the lowered level of the mainstem and are elevated at their confluence with the mainstem, forming potential barriers to upstream fish migration. Several large dams were built between 1924 and 1959 on major eastside tributaries (Conn, Rector, Milliken, and Bell dams) and the northern headwaters of the Napa River (Kimball Dam). In addition, many smaller dams can be found throughout the watershed. These numerous dams are impassable barriers to salmon and steelhead seeking their historic spawning grounds.

==Ecology==
The river also supports a remarkable diversity of fishes and recovering salmonid populations, especially chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;) and steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;). In 2003 the Napa County Resource Conservation District began an ongoing salmon monitoring program, and have recorded a run of approximately 400 - 1000 fall-run Chinook salmon the past several years. The Chinook run begins in late October through January. Conclusive evidence of historical chinook salmon populations in the Napa River basin have not been established, but the river provides appropriate habitat for salmon and its location near the entrance to the Sacramento/San Joaquin Rivers make it likely that salmon would have at least ventured into the Napa River. In 2013, a genetics study of Napa River chinook salmon revealed that two adults migrated from the Klamath River and successfully spawned in the Napa River, since four juvenile chinook collected from the Napa River in 2010 were proved to be siblings from the close similarity of their DNA and that the latter was characteristic of Klamath River chinook. These findings have important implications for the protection of the federally endangered Coastal California Chinook Salmon ESU since the Napa River, nor any stream in the Bay Area, was included in this ESU.

The Napa River basin is estimated to have historically supported a spawning run of 6,000–8,000 steelhead, and as many as 2,000–4,000 coho salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus kisutch&quot;). By the late 1960s, coho salmon were extirpated from the watershed and the steelhead population is now reduced to less than a few hundred adults. Flow reductions in key rearing streams have reduced food availability for juvenile steelhead, causing reduced growth and survival. Recently, a chum salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot;) was caught in the river. In addition, a fourth salmon species, sockeye salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;), was also identified in the Napa River.

Although diminished, the Napa River basin continues to support a fish community of greater diversity than even the Sacramento and San Joaquin River systems, including a nearly intact community of sixteen native fish species, including Steelhead, fall-run Chinook salmon, Pacific (&quot;Lampetra tridentata&quot;) and river lamprey (&quot;Lampetra ayresi&quot;), hardhead (&quot;Mylopharodon conocephalus&quot;), hitch (&quot;Lavinia exilicauda&quot;), tule perch (&quot;Hysterocarpus traski&quot;), and Sacramento splittail (&quot;Pogonichthys macrolepidotus&quot;). Because of this diversity the Napa River has been prioritized for special protection. White sturgeon (&quot;Acipenser transmontanus&quot;) and many other native and non-native fishes currently utilize the Napa River watershed.

The California golden beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis subauraticus&quot;) was historically extant. Recently beaver have recolonized the Napa River and have been documented in Napa as well as near Rutherford and Oak Knoll.

==Restoration==
As part of urban renewal in the 1970s, a concrete cover was removed from culverted sections of the Napa Creek, re-exposing the water to daylight. There is some debate as to whether this constituted one of the country&#x27;s earliest &quot;daylighting&quot; projects, since the construction was undertaken with little thought to the river&#x27;s ecology or restoration of riparian habitat.

This construction is not believed to be responsible for later flooding along the river.

More recently, vineyard owners with property that borders the Rutherford Reach, a stretch of the Napa River between St. Helena and Oakville, are allowing prime land to return to a natural state in order to help preserve the ecology of the river. The project known as Rutherford Restoration Project involves 23 property owners have combined forces to provide of land to this cause. 

After the restoration, native North American beaver returned to the area, establishing 3-4 beaver dams. These keystone species have been shown to increase fish, bird and mammal abundance and diversity in California rivers and streams. They also benefit trout and salmon by reducing sediment loads and improve water quality.
The southern part of the river has also been undergoing restoration as former salt ponds along the river are being restored to their natural state.

==Napa flood of 1986==

In 1986, the worst of 23 floods recorded since 1865 on the Napa River occurred. 5,000 people were evacuated, 250 homes were destroyed, and three people lost their lives.

After the devastating flood of 1986, the dormant Napa River Flood Project was revitalized. The Project underwent a lengthy redesign and was approved by the local voters in 1998. Construction began in 2000 and was completed by 2015.

==Recreation==

The Napa River and the surrounding watershed provide many recreational opportunities. Whitewater kayaking and rafting can be done on the upper section of river from St. Helena to Napa. The lower section of the Napa River from Napa to San Pablo Bay has flatwater that is suitable for canoeing, sea kayaking, motorboating, as well as an Italian-style gondola cruise. The Napa River Trail has segments at Kennedy Park (N 38.26764 W 122.28373) &amp; between Lincoln Ave (N 38.31055 W 122.27783) and Trancas St (N 38.32496 W 122.28384) in the city of Napa.

<text>Zeev Sternhell (; 10 April 1935 – 21 June 2020) was a Polish-born Israeli historian, political scientist, commentator on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and writer. He was one of the world&#x27;s leading theorists of the phenomenon of fascism. Sternhell headed the Department of Political Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and wrote for &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper.

==Biography==
Zeev Sternhell was born in Przemyśl in south-eastern Poland on 10 April 1935 to an affluent secular Jewish family with Zionist tendencies. His grandfather and father were textile merchants. At 5, this highly protected world around him suddenly collapsed. His father fought with the Polish army during the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and died shortly after returning home. When Poland was defeated, the family home was partially requisitioned by Soviet forces. After the German declaration of war on the Soviet Union, the family were sent to a ghetto. His mother and older sister, Ada, were killed by the Nazis when he was about seven years old. An uncle who had a permit to work outside the ghetto smuggled him to Lwów. The uncle found a Polish officer and a working-class family, rare examples in his experience of Poland at that time of people not only not anti-Semitic but ready to provide assistance to Jews, who were willing to help them. Supplied with false Aryan papers, Sternhell lived with his aunt, uncle and cousin as a Polish Catholic. After the war, he was baptized, taking the Polish name Zbigniew Orolski. He became an altar boy in the Cathedral of Kraków. In 1946, at the age of 11, Sternhell was taken to France on a Red Cross children&#x27;s train, where he lived with an aunt. He learned French and was accepted to a school in Avignon despite stiff competition.

In the winter of 1951, at the age of 16, Sternhell immigrated to Israel under the auspices of Youth Aliyah, and was sent to Magdiel boarding school. In the 1950s, he served as a platoon commander in the Golani infantry brigade, including the Sinai War. He fought as a reservist in the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War and the 1982 Lebanon War. and defined himself in 2008 as still a &#x27;super-Zionist&#x27;.

In 1957–1960, he studied history and political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, graduating with a BA &quot;cum laude&quot;. In 1969, he was awarded a Ph.D. from the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris for his thesis on &quot;The Social and Political Ideas of Maurice Barrès&quot;.

Sternhell lived in Jerusalem with his wife Ziva, an art historian, with whom he had two daughters. He died on 21 June 2020, due to complications from a medical surgery.

==Academic career==
In 1976, Sternhell became co-editor of &quot;The Jerusalem Quarterly&quot;, remaining an active contributor until 1990. He started teaching political science at the Hebrew University in 1966, becoming a full professor in 1982. In 1989, he was elected to the Léon Blum Chair of Political Science at the Hebrew University and became a member of the editorial board of &quot;History and Memory&quot;. In 1991, the French government awarded him the title of &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; for his outstanding contribution to French culture. In 1996, he was a member of the editorial board of the &quot;Journal of Political Ideologies&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2008, Sternhell was awarded the Israel Prize, for Political Science. Although the Supreme Court of Israel was petitioned to have him denied the award (see &quot;Controversies&quot; below), the court determined not to intervene in a matter beyond its jurisdiction.

==Research==
Zeev Sternhell considered fascism, in its ideological form, to be a synthesis of anti-materialist socialism and nationalism. He traced its roots to ideas that emerged in the Counter-Enlightenment in reaction to the historical turning point of 1789, when the French Revolution destroyed the Ancien Régime. He identified various strains in this reactionary movement, linking them to the three traditional right-wing families cited by René Rémond – legitimism, Orleanism, and Bonapartism together with anarchic/leftist labour movements. The main cultural influences, according to Sternhell were:
*The populist reaction to &quot;Boulangisme&quot;, a movement led by Georges Boulanger who almost succeeded in his attempt at a coup d&#x27;état in 1889;
* Georges Sorel&#x27;s variety of revolutionary syndicalism, which had a notable impact on currents among Italian anarcho-syndicalists.
* The synthesis of ideas crystallised by the publications of the Cercle Proudhon around the years 1910–1912.

The First World War provided the key circumstances that would prove favourable for transforming these French ideological trends - fascist ideology essentially had been incubated in France, he argued, in the milieu of the 1880s - into a political force in Italy in the aftermath of war. Historians challenge his view that the key ingredients of fascism were formed in that early period, in France. The essential synthesis was a consequence of World War I, and not specifically French.

His research has sparked criticism, in particular from French scholars who argue that the Vichy regime (1940–1944) was of a more traditional conservative persuasion, although belonging to the far-right, than it was counter-revolutionary, counter-revolutionary ideas being a main characteristic of fascism. René Rémond has questioned Sternhell&#x27;s attribution of Boulangism to the revolutionary right-wing movements. Some scholars say that Sternhell&#x27;s thesis may shed important light on intellectual influences of fascism, but fascism in itself was not born of a sole ideology and its sociological make-up and popularity among the working classes must also be taken into account.

Stanley G. Payne, for example, remarks in &quot;A History of Fascism&quot; that &quot;Zeev Sternhell has conclusively demonstrated that nearly all the ideas found in fascism first appeared in France,&quot; though it first developed as a political movement in Italy.

Sternhell&#x27;s identification of Spiritualism with fascism has also given rise to debate, in particular his claim that Emmanuel Mounier&#x27;s personalism movement &quot;shared ideas and political reflexes with Fascism&quot;. Sternhell has argued that Mounier&#x27;s &quot;revolt against individualism and materialism&quot; would have led him to share the ideology of fascism.

==Political views==
Sternhell is widely viewed as assuming the mantle worn by predecessors such as Jacob Talmon, Yehoshua Arieli and Yeshayahu Leibowitz as an academic &#x27;keeper at the gate&#x27; always prepared to tell the establishment what they are unwilling to see. Sternhell was a long-time supporter of the Israeli peace camp and had written critically in the Israeli press about the Israeli policy toward the Palestinians.

He described himself as liberal. Regarding Zionism, Sternhell said in an interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot;:I am not only a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains the right of the Jews to control their fate and their future. I consider the right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others&#x27; action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.
In &quot;The Founding Myths of Israel&quot; (published in Hebrew in 1995), Sternhell said the main moral justification the Zionists gave for the founding of Israel in 1948 was the Jews&#x27; historical right to the land. In the epilogue, he writes:In fact, from the beginning, a sense of urgency gave the first Zionists the profound conviction that the task of reconquering the country had a solid moral basis. The argument of the Jews&#x27; historical right to the land was merely a matter of politics and propaganda. In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews at the beginning of the century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it is all the more legitimate because of the threat of death hanging over the Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.

Sternhell argued that after the Six-Day War in 1967, the threat to the Jews had disappeared, which changed the moral basis for retaining conquests:
No leader was capable of saying that the conquest of the West Bank lacked the moral basis of the first half of the twentieth century, namely the circumstances of distress on which Israel was founded. A much-persecuted people needed and deserved not only a shelter, but also a state of its own. [...] Whereas the conquests of 1949 were an essential condition for the founding of Israel, the attempt to retain the conquests of 1967 had a strong flavor of imperial expansion.

Sternhell saw Jewish settlement on the West Bank as a wish of religious Zionism and part of labour Zionism, that the more moderate part of labour Zionism was unable to withstand because this wish was in line with deep Zionist convictions. He saw settlements on the West Bank as a danger to &quot;Israel&#x27;s ability to develop as a free and open society&quot;, because they put nationalistic aims over social and liberal aims.

He said something fundamental changed with the Oslo agreements: &quot;In the history of Zionism the Oslo agreements constitute a turning point, a true revolution. For the first time in its history, the Jewish national movement recognized the equal rights of the Palestinian people to freedom and independence.&quot; He ends the epilogue with: &quot;The only uncertain factor today is the moral and political price Israeli society will have to pay to overcome the resistance that the hard core of the settlers is bound to show to any just and reasonable solution.&quot;

In a 2014 interview, Sternhell claimed indicators of fascism exist in Israel.

==Controversies==
===Defamation trial===
Sternhell was taken to court by Bertrand de Jouvenel, in 1983, after Sternhell in his work &quot;Neither Right nor Left&quot; (&quot;Ni droite, ni gauche&quot;) described him as having been a fascist in the 1930s. Jouvenel—on whose behalf Raymond Aron testified, the only intellectual on the anti-totalitarian left to defend his past—sued him on nine counts of defamation. The judge, finding Sternhell liable on two counts, made him make amends with a fine that was more symbolic than punitive, and took care to allow Sternhell to retain the offending passages in future editions of his book, which Robert Wohl states was a &#x27;major defeat&#x27; for the plaintiff.

===Settler movement===
Sternhell was threatened on several occasions for his anti-settlement views, including an attempted bombing foiled by police. &quot;Haaretz&quot; correspondent Nadav Shragai wrote that Sternhell angered Israel&#x27;s right-wing extremists because some of his statements &quot;justified the murder of settlers by terrorists and tried to foment civil war.&quot; For instance, in a 2001 Hebrew op-ed piece, Sternhell wrote: &quot;Many in Israel, perhaps even the majority of the voters, do not doubt the legitimacy of the armed resistance in the territories themselves. The Palestinians would be wise to concentrate their struggle against the settlements, avoid harming women and children and strictly refrain from firing on Gilo, Nahal Oz or Sderot; it would also be smart to stop planting bombs to the west of the Green Line. By adopting such an approach, the Palestinians would be sketching the profile of a solution that is the only inevitable one: The amended Green Line will be an international border and territory will be handed over to compensate the Palestinians for land that has already been or will be annexed to Israel.&quot; He similarly wrote in &quot;Davar&quot; in 1988 that &quot;Only those who are prepared to take Ofra with tanks can stop the fascist erosion threatening to drown Israel&#x27;s democracy.&quot;

==Pipe bomb attack==
On 25 September 2008, Sternhell was the victim of a pipe bomb attack at his home, and was injured in the leg and hospitalized. Jerusalem police, who found fliers offering more than 1 million shekels (approximately $300,000) to anyone who kills members of Peace Now at the scene, suspected that he was attacked by right-wing settler extremists for his views. From his hospital bed, Sternhell said that &quot;the very occurrence of the incident goes to illustrate the fragility of Israeli democracy, and the urgent need to defend it with determination and resolve.&quot;

&quot;On the personal level&quot;, he continued, &quot;if the intent was to terrorize, it has to be very clear that I am not easily intimidated; but the perpetrators tried to hurt not only me, but each and every one of my family members who could have opened the door, and for that there is no absolution and no forgiveness.&quot; After his release from the hospital, he said he would continue to voice his opinions. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner condemned the attack, saying &quot;The assault on Professor Sternhell is an assault on values of peace and brotherhood that served as an inspiration to Israel&#x27;s founding fathers.&quot; When the investigation was launched, right-wing settler groups made claims that the bombing had been carried out by &quot;agents provocateurs&quot;.

In October 2009, Israel police arrested Jack Teitel, a Florida-born Jewish extremist, for the attack on Sternhell. Israel police revealed that Teitel, who apparently acted alone, also admitted to a string of other terrorist attacks and attempted attacks, including murdering a Palestinian taxi driver and a West Bank shepherd in 1997 and an attack on the home of a Messianic Jew in the settlement of Ariel in 2008.

<text>Tansu Çiller (; born 24 May 1946) is a Turkish academic, economist, and politician who served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Turkey from 1993 to 1996. She was Turkey&#x27;s first and only female prime minister. As the leader of the True Path Party, she went on to concurrently serve as Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey and as Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1996 and 1997.

As a Professor of Economics, Çiller was appointed Minister of State for the economy by Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel in 1991. When Demirel was elected as President in 1993, Çiller succeeded him as leader of the True Path Party and Prime Minister. Her premiership presided over the intensifying armed conflict between the Turkish Armed Forces and the PKK, resulting in Çiller&#x27;s enacting numerous reforms to national defense. Her government was able to persuade the United States and the European Union to register the PKK as a terrorist organization. However, she was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated against the Kurdish people by the Turkish military, security forces, and paramilitary.

Shortly after winning the 1994 local elections, large-scale capital flight due to the lack of confidence in Çiller&#x27;s budget deficit targets led to the Turkish lira and foreign currency reserves&#x27; almost collapsing. Amid the subsequent economic crisis and austerity measures, her government signed the EU-Turkey Customs Union in 1995. Her government was alleged to have supported the 1995 Azeri coup d&#x27;état attempt and presided over an escalation of tensions with Greece after claiming sovereignty over the Imia/Kardak islets.

Although the DYP came third in the 1995 general election, she remained Prime Minister until she formed a coalition government with Necmettin Erbakan in 1996. The Susurluk scandal that year revealed the relations between extra-legal organisations and Çiller&#x27;s government. Revelations that she had employed individuals connected with the Turkish mafia and the Grey Wolves such as Abdullah Çatlı led to a decline in her approval ratings. Erbakan&#x27;s and Çiller&#x27;s government fell when tensions with the military, concerned with civilians&#x27; lack of commitment to secularism, boiled over. This coup d&#x27;état by military memorandum was the fourth in the republic&#x27;s history. DYP declined further in the 1999 general election. Despite coming third in the 2002 general election, Çiller&#x27;s DYP won less than 10% of the vote and thus lost all parliamentary representation, which led to her resignation as party leader and departure from active politics.

== Background and academic career ==
Tansu Çiller was born in Istanbul; she was the only child of her father Necati Çiller, a journalist and governor of Bilecik Province during the 1950s, and Muazzez Çiller, a Rumelian Turk from Thessaloniki.

Çiller graduated from the department of Economics at Robert College Yüksek (later Boğaziçi University) after completing her high school education at the American College for Girls (later Robert College) in Istanbul. After graduating from Robert College, she continued her studies in the United States, where she earned graduate degrees from the University of New Hampshire and University of Connecticut with her husband Özer Uçuran, who she married in 1963. She later completed her postdoctoral studies at Yale University.

Çiller taught economics at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1978, she became a lecturer at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul and in 1983 she was appointed as professor by the same institution. She was also president of the now-defunct Istanbul Bank.

== Early political career ==
In addition to her job at Boğaziçi, Çiller made a name for herself with her studies at TÜSİAD and her critical reports of the Motherland Party&#x27;s (ANAP) economic policies. For a brief period she was a consultant to Bedrettin Dalan, then Mayor of Istanbul. In December of the same year, she was elected to the administrative board of the other major center-right party, the True Path Party (DYP) and became the deputy president responsible for the economy. Çiller entered parliament as a deputy from Istanbul in the 1991 election. Çiller took credit for some DYP slogans for the election, such as &quot;two keys&quot;, but also generated controversy with the economic program called UDİDEM, which was not implemented by the government. DYP won the election, and formed a coalition government with the Social Democrat Populist Party (SHP). Çiller was appointed as a minister of state responsible for the economy by Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel. She was elected to the executive board of DYP and acquired the position of deputy chair.

After the death in office of President Turgut Özal (which according to some was part of an alleged military coup), Prime Minister Demirel won the 1993 presidential election. Suddenly the important position as Prime Minister and leader of the DYP was vacant. The party found itself in a leadership crisis. Çiller was no obvious candidate, but her three challengers could not muster the political capital to compete effectively. The media and business community supported her, and her gender gave the impression that Turkey was a progressive Muslim country. She fell 11 votes shy of a majority in the first ballot for party leader. Her opponents withdrew and Çiller became the party&#x27;s leader and on 25 June, the first and so far only female Prime Minister of Turkey. She continued the DYP-SHP coalition with small changes (50th government of Turkey).

== As prime minister ==

While forming her coalition an Islamist mob set fire to a hotel which was hosting an Alevi cultural event, killing 35. The Sivas massacre and the government&#x27;s slow response foreshadowed Çiller&#x27;s future handling of human rights.

Çiller chose to continue Demirel&#x27;s coalition government with the SHP, but replaced most of the ministers from her own party. She was the only woman in cabinet until 1995, when a woman state minister for women and family affairs was appointed. As Prime Minister Çiller promoted a pro-military conservative populism and economic liberalism. She shifted the DYP more to the right compared to her mentor Demirel. She juggled &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; styles, boasting of her &quot;toughness&quot; at the same time as she wanted to be the nation&#x27;s mother and sister. She became a new role model for women politicians, though was accused of being authoritarian. Çiller appeared uninterested in women&#x27;s issues.

Çiller played a major role in reforming Turkey&#x27;s economic institutions, which are known as the and was rewarded with IMF funding.

=== Fighting the PKK ===

Her premiership preceded over the intensifying armed conflict between the Turkish Armed Forces and the PKK, resulting in Çiller&#x27;s enacting numerous reforms to national defense and implementing the Castle Plan. The Castle Plan (previously approved by the National Security Council) was implemented to combat the PKK (although elements of the strategy preceded the official plan). Çiller transformed the Turkish Army from an organization using vintage equipment from the US Army into a modern fighting force capable of countering the PKK, using hit-and-run tactics. With a better equipped military, Çiller&#x27;s government was able to persuade the United States and the European Union to register the PKK as a terrorist organization. However, Çiller was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated against the Kurdish people by the Turkish military, security forces, and paramilitary. Several reports of international organizations of human rights documented destroying and burning Kurdish villages and towns and extrajudicial killings of Kurdish civilians perpetrated by the Turkish military during Çiller&#x27;s government of 1993–1996. 

Her overall approach to the Kurds was ambiguous, while she suggested for the Kurds an autonomy similar the one the Basques have in Spain, she retracted her statement upon pressure from the Turkish military.

=== Links with organized crime ===

She declared in October 1993: &quot;We know the list of businessmen and artists subjected to racketeering by the PKK and we shall be bringing their members to account.&quot; Beginning on 14 January 1994, almost a hundred people were kidnapped by commandos wearing uniforms and traveling in police vehicles and then killed somewhere along the road from Ankara to Istanbul. Abdullah Çatlı, a leader of the ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves and an organized crime figure, demanded money from people who were on &quot;Çiller’s list&quot;, promising to get their names removed. One of his victims, Behçet Cantürk, was to pay ten million dollars, to which Casino King Ömer Lütfü Topal added a further seventeen million. However, after receiving the money, he then went on to have them kidnapped and killed, and sometimes tortured beforehand.

=== Corruption ===
Following the collapse of her government, allegations of corruption were filed against Çiller, included among the many charges was that she interfered in the privatization of the state run corporations Tofaş and Tedaş by demanding that she should read the sealed bids that prospective companies put forward. These bids were later given back to the privatization board and were found to be opened, presumably allowing Çiller the opportunity to financially benefit from the privatization. In addition she allegedly used discretionary funds allocated to the prime ministry for her personal benefit, and refused to reveal to President Demirel or to future Prime Minister Mesut Yılmaz what they were used for, using the excuse of &quot;national security.&quot;

Her popularity also suffered when &quot;Milliyet&quot; ran an exposé of her undeclared properties in the United States. A motion to investigate Çiller&#x27;s assets was rejected in the parliament. She announced that she would donate her property to the Martyr Zübeyde Hanım Mother&#x27;s Foundation before the 1995 election, but never followed through with this.

=== Foreign Policy ===

The EU-Turkey Customs Union agreement was signed in 1995 and came into effect in 1996 during Çiller&#x27;s government.

In March 1995, the 1995 Azeri coup d&#x27;état attempt took place; official reports following the 1996 Susurluk scandal suggested Çiller and others in cabinet had supported the coup attempt, which aimed to reinstall Ebulfeyz Elçibey as president.

Çiller was prime minister during the January 1996 Imia/Kardak crisis with neighbouring Greece. As deputy Prime Minister under Erbakan&#x27;s premiership, Çiller declared that if Greece tried to divide Albania, it would have the Turkish Army in Athens 24 hours later.

She was the first Turkish Prime Minister to visit Israel as well as meet with Yaser Arafat.

== 1995 election and Ana-Yol government ==
After the withdrawal of the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) from the coalition in October 1995 (the SHP had split, merged, and renamed itself) Çiller attempted to form a minority government with confidence and supply from the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which failed in less than a month (51st government of Turkey). She agreed to form another cabinet (52nd government of Turkey) with the CHP in the lead up to 1995 general election. Çiller employed nationalist and secularist rhetoric in the party&#x27;s first election with her as party chair. DYP received a resounding defeat, losing 30% of its support from 1991.

Coalition negotiations were protracted, and Çiller remained in office at the head of the DYP-CHP coalition until March 1996, when the DYP formed an unstable coalition with ANAP and the Democratic Left Party (DSP) supplying confidence, with Mesut Yılmaz becoming Prime Minister, and herself Alternate Prime Minister. Necmettin Erbakan filed suit in the Constitutional Court when the government succeeded in a vote of confidence with only a plurality, not a majority –Bülent Ecevit&#x27;s DSP voted to abstain in the end. Çiller found herself boxed in from two directions: the Grand National Assembly voted to investigate allegations of corruption against her in a vote in which opposition parties –even her coalition partners– supported, and the Constitutional Court ruled that the government&#x27;s vote of confidence was unconstitutional. Prime Minister Yılmaz resigned 6 June, ending the ANAYOL government.

== Refah-Yol government and MGK memorandum ==

After the Motherland–DYP coalition collapsed in June 1996, the DYP formed a historic coalition with the Welfare Party (RP), under Necmettin Erbakan, with Çiller as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Prime Minister, and Alternate Prime Minister. This coalition was controversial, not only did an openly Islamist politician become premier for the first time in the history of the Turkish Republic, but Çiller lost credibility for joining forces with those she most criticized on the campaign trail. Whatever Çiller and Erbakan said of each other in the past was history, both were isolated and needed each other to survive. Çiller needed a coalition partner to keep a parliamentary majority from lifting her and her allies&#x27; immunities to investigate her corruption charges, while Erbakan needed the same so as to fight his ideological struggle against the secularist Turkish military.

In an eight (Welfare and DYP members) to seven vote, the Parliamentary Investigation Commission decided that her misuse of public funds on Tofaş and Tedaş tenders had no need to be reviewed by the Constitutional Court. The coalition with Welfare has been interpreted as a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for Çiller&#x27;s acquittal. She was reelected chairwoman of DYP in a party congress, but Hüsamettin Çindoruk quit with several DYP deputies to form the Democrat Turkey Party (DTP).

=== Susurluk ===
After the November 1996 Susurluk car crash, which resulted in a scandal that demonstrated the close ties that the government, security services, organized crime, and far-right groups had with each other, she praised Abdullah Çatlı, who died in the crash, saying: &quot;Those who fire bullets or suffer their wounds in the name of this country, this nation, and this state will always be respectfully remembered by us.&quot; The Citizens&#x27; Initiative for Eternal Light lead a series of protests against the government for its links with organized crime groups. Interior Minister Mehmet Ağar resigned following the scandal, and was replaced by Meral Akşener.

=== 1997 &quot;post-modern&quot; coup ===
The Turkish Armed Forces eyed the coalition with great suspicion, but Çiller hoped that her secular credentials and strong relationship with the military could ease tensions. She positioned herself as an intermediate between the secularist military and the Islamist Welfare Party. However, by the beginning of 1997, relations between the government and the military were increasingly strained, especially after a Welfare mayor of Sincan hosted the Iranian Ambassador who gave a speech in support of Sharia Law (See Jerusalem Meeting). The military subsequently displayed a show of strength by driving a tank convoy through Sincan a few days later.

After a nine-hour National Security Council meeting held on 28 February 1997, a set of demands were presented to the Refah-Yol government to combat what the military called &quot;İrtica&quot; (reactionarism). Çiller&#x27;s relationship with the military completely broke down. She saw that the military was determined to overthrow the government, and recommended retiring the chief of staff and force commanders, but this which was blocked by a calmer Erbakan. Çiller and Akşener were successful in sacking the Chief of National Police and getting his replacement to wiretap high ranking generals of the Turkish Armed Forces. Upon one general learning of that he was being wiretaped by the Interior Ministry he allegedly threatened to &quot;impale her [Akşener] like a goose.&quot;

With resignations of DYP ministers from the government and pressure from the military, Erbakan resigned, and the &quot;post-modern coup&quot; concluded on 30 June 1997. DYP and others expected to form a government under Çiller, but President Demirel disregarded the rotation agreement and asked ANAP leader Yılmaz to form the new government instead. While Erbakan&#x27;s fall from power condemned his political career until the end of his life, Çiller&#x27;s was also effectively over. Her maneuvers, political excuses, failed policies, and scandals made her very unpopular. Almost one-third of her party didn&#x27;t join in voting with her against the confidence vote of Yılmaz&#x27;s new government. 35 women&#x27;s organizations took her to court because she lacked feminist principles. She was also criticized for undermining democracy and threatening journalists.

== Fall from politics ==
Çiller was investigated by the Turkish Parliament on serious corruption charges and abuses of power following her period in government. Along with Mesut Yılmaz, she was later cleared of all charges mainly due to technicalities such as statute of limitations and parliamentary immunity. Near the end of 1998, the corruption files about Yılmaz and Çiller were covered up at the commissions of the parliament in a common action staged by DYP, ANAP and DSP MPs. In the 1999 general election she presented herself as a leader of the downtrodden and the religious, pausing her campaign speeches during the prayer of Adhan, or demanding that women with their headscarves on should attend university. Her party polled at only about 12%. She was still reelected DYP&#x27;s chairwoman in a party conference later that year, and became Leader of the Main Opposition with the closure of Erbakan&#x27;s Virtue Party and the split in the Milli Görüş movement.

Çiller&#x27;s political career came to its end when her party narrowly failed to poll above the 10% threshold in the 2002 general election, thus receiving no representation in parliament despite her role as Leader of Main Opposition for more than two years. In a press conference she announced her retirement from politics, and was succeeded by Mehmet Ağar.

== Later career ==

Çiller is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

In 2018, Çiller attended a Justice and Development Party rally in support of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&#x27;s candidacy for that year&#x27;s presidential election.

In February, 2024 She endorsed Murat Kurum for 2024 Istanbul mayoral election.

== Personal life ==
In addition to Turkish, Çiller can speak English and German fluently. She has two children with her husband, Özer Uçuran Çiller who died of heart attack at his home in Yeniköy, İstanbul, on 1 June 2024, at the age of 86.

<doc id="753273" wikidata="Q990256" url="?curid=753273" title="Bart Sibrel">
<text>Bart Winfield Sibrel (born ) is an American conspiracy theorist who has written, produced, and directed films arguing that the Apollo Moon landings between 1969 and 1972 were staged by NASA under the control of the CIA. He has created four independent films promoting the ideas, with the first having been the film &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon&quot; (2001). 

In his works, Sibrel films himself asking various Apollo astronauts to put their hand on the Bible and swear that they walked on the Moon. In the case of the Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, whom Sibrel arranged to meet on a false pretense, outside the Luxe Hotel in Beverly Hills, the interaction resulted in Aldrin punching Sibrel, which brought him significant publicity. However, no criminal charges were filed against Aldrin.

==Background==
Sibrel has been a director of TV commercials and is sometimes identified as a maker of &quot;documentaries&quot; with respect to his self-released Moon landing denial films, though other sources point out the personal distribution, limited release, and style and content call into question placing Sibrel&#x27;s work in this genre of filmmaking (e.g., with the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; placing the word documentary in quotation marks in some of their reports). This concern relates in part to Sibrel&#x27;s record of misrepresenting his identity to the subjects he attempts to interview, notably repeated attempts involving former astronauts including Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, Alan Bean, Eugene Cernan, and Edgar Mitchell (where Sibrel posed as filmmaker associated with the History Channel).

As of 2002, Sibrel was operating a video production company in Nashville, Tennessee, and had &quot;made a career out of perpetuating the notion that NASA&#x27;s Apollo moon missions were hoaxes.&quot;

Sibrel&#x27;s single most notable work is a 47-minute video work likewise calling into question the historicity of the Apollo Moon missions; entitled &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon&quot;, Sibrel describes the Apollo program as a &quot;Cold War CIA and Nixon administration deception.&quot; Amanda Hess, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, alludes to the work as a pseudo-documentary, and describes the work in this way: &quot;It mashed up moon footage with ominous shots from the Soviet Union and Vietnam, was narrated by a severe British woman and was sold on a [personal] website called MoonMovie.com.&quot; Sibrel confronted several Apollo astronauts in the preparation of his videos, all of whom responded indifferently or negatively when they realized that they were being challenged on their achievement of landing and walking on the Moon.

During 2019, the Bart Sibrel YouTube channel was demonetized.

===Moon landing denial===

In a July 2019 HBO interview, Sibrel stated the following main reasons that he believed the Apollo missions were a fake:
* Apollo&#x27;s achievement with its 50-year-old technology cannot be reproduced in 2019 by any nation in the world, including the United States (only now is modern technology capable of faking the Moon landings).
* The shadows appearing in one of the Apollo 11 photographs are not parallel, and therefore must have been taken in a studio with multiple light sources (in fact this is consistent with reflection from the lunar surface and inconsistent with the existence of only one shadow per object).
* The Van Allen radiation belt that exists around the Earth does not allow humans to pass through it due to its extreme radiation (the Apollo 11 crew were within the belts for under two hours so would have been exposed to an estimated 18 rads – well within safe limits).

All the common Moon landing denial theories, including Sibrel&#x27;s and others, have been repeatedly debunked.

==Aldrin incident==
One confrontational incident involved Apollo 11 crew member Buzz Aldrin. Earlier, Sibrel had interviewed Aldrin in a hotel room for his film &quot;Astronauts Gone Wild&quot;. In that interview, Sibrel confronted Aldrin with purported newly discovered footage from the Apollo 11 mission, to which Aldrin replied: &quot;Well, you&#x27;re talking to the wrong guy! Why don&#x27;t you talk to the administrator at NASA? We were passengers, we&#x27;re guys going on a flight.&quot; Sibrel refers, in &quot;post hoc&quot; interviews, to two confrontations with Aldrin prior to the one that resulted in his being punched. 

Regarding the subsequent interaction, occurring on September 9, 2002, the BBC reported that witnesses came forward to the police with jurisdiction, the Beverly Hills Police Department, stating: &quot;Mr Sibrel...lured Mr Aldrin to the hotel under false pretences in order to interview him.&quot; By Aldrin&#x27;s account, he went to the Beverly Hills hotel on that date under the pretext of an interview on space for a Japanese children&#x27;s television show. At the time, Aldrin was aged 72 and Sibrel was aged 37.

Sibrel attempted on-camera to coerce Aldrin to swear an oath on a Bible that he had been on the Moon. Witnesses came forward to the police indicating that &quot;Sibrel had aggressively poked Mr Aldrin with the Bible&quot;. When Aldrin refused Sibrel&#x27;s request, Sibrel followed him, saying: &quot;You&#x27;re the one who said you walked on the Moon when you didn&#x27;t.&quot; The BBC reported that &quot;Deputy District Attorney Elizabeth Ratinoff told Reuters... [the] videotape shot by a cameraman hired by Mr Sibrel had shown the film-maker follow Mr Aldrin, calling him a &#x27;thief, liar and coward&#x27;.&quot; Still being recorded by Sibrel&#x27;s camera crew, Aldrin responded with &quot;Will you get away from me?&quot; and then punched Sibrel in the jaw.

On the day following the altercation, a statement from a lawyer for Aldrin described the &quot;6-foot-2, 250-pound &quot;[1.88 m, 113 kg]&quot; Sibrel forc[ing] Aldrin up against a wall and refus[ing] to let him leave&quot;, thus making the case for self-defense. Aldrin made the case to police that he had been attempting to defend &quot;himself and his stepdaughter, who was with him at the time&quot;.

Sibrel gave the tape to the police, apparently alleging assault. The incident received significant publicity, with many television talk shows airing the clip, usually supporting Aldrin&#x27;s action. Shortly after the altercation, Sibrel told the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;: &quot;[Aldrin] has a good punch. It was quick, too. I didn&#x27;t see it coming.&quot; 

As described by Eric Spitznagel for &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, since &quot;witnesses testified that Sibrel had provoked [Aldrin], assault charges against the former astronaut were dropped&quot;. Police either did not file or dropped charges based on Aldrin&#x27;s lack of a prior criminal record, witness accounts of Sibrel&#x27;s having drawn Aldrin to the hotel under false pretenses, Sibrel&#x27;s aggressiveness before the punch, and his having declined to seek medical attention and sustaining &quot;no visible injury&quot;.

==Conviction for vandalism in parking dispute==
In July 2009, Sibrel, who at the time was working as a Nashville taxicab driver, was charged with vandalism when he jumped up and down on the hood of a car owned by a woman with whom he was having a parking dispute. Court documents show he was arrested after the driver refused to pull out of a parking space he wanted. The arresting officer wrote, &quot;A few moments later the parking space in front of the victim opened up and Sibrel drove into it and parked.&quot; Sibrel &quot;then walked up to the victim&#x27;s car and jumped onto the hood, and then jumped up and down several times.&quot; The report says he caused $1,431 worth of damage, after which Sibrel pleaded guilty to vandalism and was placed on probation.

<text>The Roman army () served ancient Rome and the Roman people, enduring through the Roman Kingdom (753–509 BC), the Roman Republic (509–27 BC), and the Roman Empire (27 BC–AD 476/AD 1453), including the Western Roman Empire (collapsed AD 476/480) and the Eastern Roman Empire (collapsed AD 1453). It is thus a term that broadly spans approximately 1229/2,206 years, during which the force underwent numerous permutations in size, composition, organisation, equipment and tactics, while conserving a core of lasting traditions.

== Early Roman army (c. 550 – c. 300 BC) ==
Until , there was no &quot;national&quot; Roman army, but a series of clan-based war-bands which only coalesced into a united force in periods of serious external threat. Around 550 BC, during the period conventionally known as the rule of king Servius Tullius, it appears that a universal levy of eligible adult male citizens was instituted. This development apparently coincided with the introduction of heavy armour for most of the infantry. Although originally low in numbers, the Roman infantry was extremely effective and developed some influential battle strategies.

The early Roman army was based on a compulsory levy from adult male citizens which was held at the start of each campaigning season, in those years that war was declared. There were no standing or professional forces. During the regal period (to c. 500 BC), the standard levy was probably of 9,000 men, consisting of 6,000 heavily armed infantry (probably Greek-style hoplites), plus 2,400 light-armed infantry (&quot;rorarii&quot;, later called &quot;velites&quot;) and 600 light cavalry (). When the kings were replaced by two annually elected &quot;praetores&quot; in c. 500 BC, the standard levy remained of the same size, but was now divided equally between the praetors, each commanding one legion of 4,500 men.

It is likely that the hoplite element was deployed in a Greek-style phalanx formation in large set-piece battles. However, these were relatively rare, with most fighting consisting of small-scale border-raids and skirmishing. In these, the Romans would fight in their basic tactical unit, the &quot;centuria&quot; of 100 men. In addition, separate clan-based forces remained in existence until at least, although they would operate under the Praetors&#x27; authority, at least nominally.

In 493 BC, shortly after the establishment of the Roman Republic, Rome concluded a perpetual treaty of military alliance (the &quot;Foedus Cassianum&quot;), with the combined other Latin city-states. The treaty, probably motivated by the need for the Latins to deploy a united defence against incursions by neighbouring hill-tribes, provided for each party to provide an equal force for campaigns under unified command. It remained in force until 358 BC.

== Roman army of the mid-Republic (c. 300 – 107 BC) ==
The central feature of the Roman army of the mid-Republic, or the Polybian army, was the manipular organization of its battle-line. Instead of a single, large mass (the phalanx) as in the Early Roman army, the Romans now drew up in three lines consisting of small units (maniples) of 120 men, arrayed in chessboard fashion, giving much greater tactical strength and flexibility. This structure was probably introduced in c. 300 BC during the Samnite Wars. Also probably dating from this period was the regular accompaniment of each legion by a non-citizen formation of roughly equal size, the &quot;ala&quot;, recruited from Rome&#x27;s Italian allies, or &quot;socii&quot;. The latter were approximately 150 autonomous states which were bound by a treaty of perpetual military alliance with Rome. Their sole obligation was to supply to the Roman army, on demand, a number of fully equipped troops up to a specified maximum each year.

The Second Punic War (218–201 BC) saw the addition of a third element to the existing dual Roman/Italian structure: non-Italian mercenaries with specialist skills lacking in the legions and &quot;alae&quot;: Numidian light cavalry, Cretan archers, and Balearic slingers. From this time, these units always accompanied Roman armies.

The Republican army of this period, like its earlier forebear, did not maintain standing or professional military forces, but levied them, by compulsory conscription, as required for each campaigning season and disbanded thereafter (although formations could be kept in being over winter during major wars). The standard levy was doubled during the Samnite Wars to four legions (two per consul), for a total of c. 18,000 Roman troops and four allied &quot;alae&quot; of similar size. Service in the legions was limited to property-owning Roman citizens, normally those known as &quot;iuniores&quot; (age 16–46). The army&#x27;s senior officers, including its commanders-in-chief, the Roman consuls, were all elected annually at the People&#x27;s Assembly. Only &quot;equites&quot; (members of the Roman knightly order) were eligible to serve as senior officers. of the highest social classes ( and the First Class of commoners) provided the legion&#x27;s cavalry, the other classes the legionary infantry. The (those assessed at under 400 wealth) were ineligible for legionary service and were assigned to the fleets as oarsmen. Elders, vagrants, freedmen, slaves and convicts were excluded from the military levy, save in emergencies.

The legionary cavalry also changed, probably around 300 BC onwards from the light, unarmoured horse of the early army to a heavy force with metal armour (bronze cuirasses and, later, chain-mail shirts). Contrary to a long-held view, the cavalry of the mid-Republic was a highly effective force that generally prevailed against strong enemy cavalry forces (both Gallic and Greek) until it was decisively beaten by the Carthaginian general Hannibal&#x27;s horsemen during the Second Punic War. This was due to Hannibal&#x27;s greater operational flexibility owing to his Numidian light cavalry.

The Polybian army&#x27;s operations during its existence can be divided into three broad phases. (1) The struggle for hegemony over Italy, especially against the Samnite League (338–264 BC); (2) the struggle with Carthage for hegemony in the western Mediterranean Sea (264–201 BC); and (3) the struggle against the Hellenistic monarchies for control of the eastern Mediterranean (201–91 BC). During the earlier phase, the normal size of the levy (including allies) was in the region of 40,000 men (two consular armies of c. 20,000 men each).
During the latter phase, with lengthy wars of conquest followed by permanent military occupation of overseas provinces, the character of the army necessarily changed from a temporary force based entirely on short-term conscription to a standing army in which the conscripts, whose service was in this period limited by law to six consecutive years, were complemented by large numbers of volunteers who were willing to serve for much longer periods. Many of the volunteers were drawn from the poorest social class, which until the Second Punic War had been excluded from service in the legions by the minimum property requirement: during that war, extreme manpower needs had forced the army to ignore the requirement, and this practice continued thereafter. Maniples were gradually phased out as the main tactical unit, and replaced by the larger cohorts used in the allied &quot;&quot;, a process probably complete by the time the general Marius assumed command in 107 BC. (The so-called &quot;Marian reforms&quot; of the army hypothesised by some scholars are today seen by other scholars as having evolved earlier and more gradually.)

In the period after the defeat of Carthage in 201 BC, the army was campaigning exclusively outside Italy, resulting in its men being away from their home plots of land for many years at a stretch. They were assuaged by the large amounts of booty that they shared after victories in the rich eastern theatre. But in Italy, the ever-increasing concentration of public lands in the hands of big landowners, and the consequent displacement of the soldiers&#x27; families, led to great unrest and demands for land redistribution. This was successfully achieved, but resulted in the disaffection of Rome&#x27;s Italian allies, who as non-citizens were excluded from the redistribution. This led to the mass revolt of the &quot;&quot; and the Social War (91-88 BC). The result was the grant of Roman citizenship to all Italians and the end of the Polybian army&#x27;s dual structure: the were abolished and the recruited into the legions.

== Imperial Roman army (30 BC – AD 284) ==

Under the founder–emperor Augustus (ruled 30 BC – 14 AD), the legions, c. 5,000-strong all-heavy infantry formations recruited from Roman citizens only, were transformed from a mixed conscript and volunteer corps serving an average of 10 years, to all-volunteer units of long-term professionals serving a standard 25-year term (conscription was only decreed in emergencies). In the later 1st century, the size of a legion&#x27;s First Cohort was doubled, increasing legionary personnel to c. 5,500.
Alongside the legions, Augustus established the auxilia, a regular corps of similar numbers to the legions, recruited from the &quot;peregrini&quot; (non-citizen inhabitants of the empire – about 90% of the empire&#x27;s population in the 1st century). As well as comprising large numbers of extra heavy infantry equipped in a similar manner to legionaries, the auxilia provided virtually all the army&#x27;s cavalry (heavy and light), light infantry, archers and other specialists. The auxilia were organised in c. 500-strong units called (all-infantry), (all-cavalry) and (infantry with a cavalry contingent attached). Around 80 AD, a minority of auxiliary regiments were doubled in size. Until about 68 AD, the auxilia were recruited by a mix of conscription and voluntary enlistment. After that time, the auxilia became largely a volunteer corps, with conscription resorted to only in emergencies. Auxiliaries were required to serve a minimum of 25 years, although many served for longer periods. On completion of their minimum term, auxiliaries were awarded Roman citizenship, which carried important legal, fiscal and social advantages. Alongside the regular forces, the army of the Principate employed allied native units (called &quot;numeri&quot;) from outside the empire on a mercenary basis. These were led by their own aristocrats and equipped in traditional fashion. Numbers fluctuated according to circumstances and are largely unknown.

As all-citizen formations, and symbolic guarantors of the dominance of the Italian hegemony, legions enjoyed greater social prestige than the auxilia. This was reflected in better pay and benefits. In addition, legionaries were equipped with more expensive and protective armour than auxiliaries. However, in 212, the emperor Caracalla granted Roman citizenship to all the empire&#x27;s inhabitants. At this point, the distinction between legions and auxilia became moot, the latter becoming all-citizen units also. The change was reflected in the disappearance, during the 3rd century, of legionaries&#x27; special equipment, and the progressive break-up of legions into cohort-sized units like the auxilia.
By the end of Augustus&#x27; reign, the imperial army numbered some 250,000 men, equally split between legionaries and auxiliaries (25 legions and c. 250 auxiliary regiments). The numbers grew to a peak of about 450,000 by 211 (33 legions and c. 400 auxiliary regiments). By then, auxiliaries outnumbered legionaries substantially. From the peak, numbers probably underwent a steep decline by 270 due to plague and losses during multiple major barbarian invasions. Numbers were restored to their early 2nd-century level of c. 400,000 (but probably not to their 211 peak) under Diocletian (r. 284–305). After the empire&#x27;s borders became settled (on the Rhine-Danube line in Europe) by 68, virtually all military units (except the Praetorian Guard) were stationed on or near the borders, in roughly 17 of the 42 provinces of the empire in the reign of Hadrian (r. 117–138).

The military chain of command was relatively uniform across the Empire. In each province, the deployed legions&#x27; &quot;legati&quot; (legion commanders, who also controlled the auxiliary regiments attached to their legion) reported to the (provincial governor), who also headed the civil administration. The governor in turn reported directly to the emperor in Rome. There was no army general staff in Rome, but the leading &quot;praefectus praetorio&quot; (commander of the Praetorian Guard) often acted as the emperor&#x27;s de facto military chief-of-staff.

Legionary rankers were relatively well-paid, compared to contemporary common labourers. Compared with their subsistence-level peasant families, they enjoyed considerable disposable income, enhanced by periodic cash bonuses on special occasions such as the accession of a new emperor. In addition, on completion of their term of service, they were given a generous discharge bonus equivalent to 13 years&#x27; salary. Auxiliaries were paid much less in the early 1st century, but by 100 AD, the differential had virtually disappeared. Similarly, in the earlier period, auxiliaries appear not to have received cash and discharge bonuses, but probably did so from Hadrian onwards. Junior officers (), the equivalent of non-commissioned officers in modern armies, could expect to earn up to twice basic pay. Legionary centurions, the equivalent of mid-level commissioned officers, were organised in an elaborate hierarchy. Usually risen from the ranks, they commanded the legion&#x27;s tactical sub-units of &quot;centuriae&quot; (c. 80 men) and cohorts (c. 480 men). They were paid several multiples of basic pay. The most senior centurion, the , was elevated to equestrian rank upon completion of his single-year term of office. The senior officers of the army, the (legion commanders), &quot;tribuni militum&quot; (legion staff officers) and the &quot;praefecti&quot; (commanders of auxiliary regiments) were all of at least equestrian rank. In the 1st and early 2nd centuries, they were mainly Italian aristocrats performing the military component of their (conventional career path). Later, provincial career officers became predominant. Senior officers were paid very high salaries, multiples of at least 50 times basic.

A typical Roman army during this period consisted of five to six legions. One legion was made up of ten cohorts. The first cohort had five each of 160 soldiers. In the second through tenth cohorts there were six &quot;&quot; of 80 men each. These do not include archers, cavalry or officers.
Soldiers spent only a fraction of their lives on campaign. Most of their time was spent on routine military duties such as training, patrolling, and maintenance of equipment, etc. Soldiers also played an important role outside the military sphere. They performed the function of a provincial governor&#x27;s police force. As a large, disciplined and skilled force of fit men, they played a crucial role in the construction of a province&#x27;s Roman military and civil infrastructure: in addition to constructing forts and fortified defences such as Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, they built roads, bridges, ports, public buildings, entire new cities (Roman colonies), and also engaged in large-scale forest clearance and marsh drainage to expand the province&#x27;s available arable land.

Soldiers, mostly drawn from polytheistic societies, enjoyed wide freedom of worship in the polytheistic Roman system. They revered their own native deities, Roman deities and the local deities of the provinces in which they served. Only a few religions were banned by the Roman authorities, as being incompatible with the official Roman religion and/or politically subversive, notably Druidism and Christianity. The later Principate saw the rise in popularity among the military of Eastern mystery cults, generally centred on one deity, and involving secret rituals divulged only to initiates. By far the most popular in the army was Mithraism, an apparently syncretist religion which mainly originated in Asia Minor.

== Late Roman army/East Roman army (284–641) ==
The Late Roman army is the term used to denote the military forces of the Roman Empire from the accession of emperor Diocletian in 284 until the Empire&#x27;s definitive division into Eastern and Western halves in 395. A few decades afterwards, the Western army disintegrated as the Western Empire collapsed. The East Roman army, on the other hand, continued intact and essentially unchanged until its reorganization by themes and transformation into the Byzantine army in the 7th century. The term &quot;late Roman army&quot; is often used to include the East Roman army.

The army of the Principate underwent a significant transformation, as a result of the chaotic 3rd century. Unlike the Principate army, the army of the 4th century was heavily dependent on conscription and its soldiers were more poorly remunerated than in the 2nd century. Barbarians from outside the empire probably supplied a much larger proportion of the late army&#x27;s recruits than in the army of the 1st and 2nd centuries.
The size of the 4th-century army is controversial. More dated scholars (e.g. A. H. M. Jones, writing in the 1960s) estimated the late army as much larger than the Principate army, half the size again or even as much as twice the size. With the benefit of archaeological discoveries of recent decades, many contemporary historians view the late army as no larger than its predecessor: under Diocletian c. 390,000 (the same as under Hadrian almost two centuries earlier) and under Constantine no greater, and probably somewhat smaller, than the Principate peak of c. 440,000. The main change in structure was the establishment of large armies that accompanied the emperors () and were generally based away from the frontiers. Their primary function was to deter usurpations. The legions were split up into smaller units comparable in size to the auxiliary regiments of the Principate. In parallel, legionary armour and equipment were abandoned in favour of auxiliary equipment. Infantry adopted the more protective equipment of the Principate cavalry.

The role of cavalry in the late army does not appear to have been enhanced as compared with the army of the Principate. The evidence is that cavalry was much the same proportion of overall army numbers as in the 2nd century and that its tactical role and prestige remained similar. Indeed, the cavalry acquired a reputation for incompetence and cowardice for their role in three major battles in mid-4th century. In contrast, the infantry retained its traditional reputation for excellence.

The 3rd and 4th centuries saw the upgrading of many existing border forts to make them more defensible, as well as the construction of new forts with much higher defensive specifications. The interpretation of this trend has fuelled an ongoing debate whether the army adopted a defence-in-depth strategy or continued the same posture of &quot;forward defence&quot; as in the early Principate. Many elements of the late army&#x27;s defence posture were similar to those associated with forward defence, such as a looser forward location of forts, frequent cross-border operations, and external buffer-zones of allied barbarian tribes. Whatever the defence strategy, it was apparently less successful in preventing barbarian incursions than in the 1st and 2nd centuries. This may have been due to heavier barbarian pressure, and/or to the practice of keeping large armies of the best troops in the interior, depriving the border forces of sufficient support.

== Byzantine army (641–1081) ==
== Komnenian Byzantine army (1081–1204) ==
The Komnenian period marked a rebirth of the Byzantine army. At the beginning of the Komnenian period in 1081, the Byzantine Empire had been reduced to the smallest territorial extent. Surrounded by enemies, and financially ruined by a long period of civil war, the empire&#x27;s prospects looked grim.

At the beginning of the Komnenian period, the Byzantine army was reduced to a shadow of its former self: during the 11th century, decades of peace and neglect had reduced the old thematic forces, and the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 had destroyed the professional &quot;tagmata&quot;, the core of the Byzantine army. At Manzikert and later at Dyrrhachium, units tracing their lineage for centuries back to Late Roman army were wiped out, and the subsequent loss of Asia Minor deprived the Empire of its main recruiting ground. In the Balkans, at the same time, the Empire was exposed to invasions by the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, and by Pecheneg raids across the Danube.

The Byzantine army&#x27;s nadir was reached in 1091, when Alexios I Komnenos could manage to field only 500 soldiers from the Empire&#x27;s professional forces. These formed the nucleus of the army, with the addition of the armed retainers of Alexios&#x27; relatives and the nobles enrolled in the army and the substantial aid of a large force of allied Cumans, which won the Battle of Levounion against the Pechenegs (Petcheneks or Patzinaks). Yet, through a combination of skill, determination and years of campaigning, Alexios, John and Manuel Komnenos managed to restore the power of the Byzantine Empire by constructing a new army from scratch. This process should not, however, at least in its earlier phases, be seen as a planned exercise in military restructuring. In particular, Alexios I was often reduced to reacting to events rather than controlling them; the changes he made to the Byzantine army were largely done out of immediate necessity and were pragmatic in nature.

The new force had a core of units which were both professional and disciplined. It contained formidable guards units such as the Varangians, the &quot;Athanatoi&quot;, a unit of heavy cavalry stationed in Constantinople, the Vardariotai and the Archontopouloi, recruited by Alexios from the sons of dead Byzantine officers, foreign mercenary regiments, and also units of professional soldiers recruited from the provinces. These provincial troops included &quot;kataphraktoi&quot; cavalry from Macedonia, Thessaly and Thrace, and various other provincial forces such as Trebizond archers from the Black Sea coast of Anatolia. Alongside troops raised and paid for directly by the state the Komnenian army included the armed followers of members of the wider imperial family and its extensive connections. In this can be seen the beginnings of the feudalisation of the Byzantine military. The granting of &quot;pronoia&quot; holdings, where land, or more accurately rights to revenue from land, was held in return for military obligations, was beginning to become a notable element in the military infrastructure towards the end of the Komnenian period, though it became much more important subsequently.

In 1097, the Byzantine army numbered around 70,000 men altogether. By 1180 and the death of Manuel Komnenos, whose frequent campaigns had been on a grand scale, the army was probably considerably larger. During the reign of Alexios I, the field army numbered around 20,000 men which was increased to about 30,000 men in John II&#x27;s reign. By the end of Manuel I&#x27;s reign the Byzantine field army had risen to 40,000 men.

== Palaiologan Byzantine army (1261–1453) ==

The Palaiologan army refers to the military forces of the Byzantine Empire from the late 13th century to its final collapse in the mid 15th century, under the House of the Palaiologoi. The army was a direct continuation of the forces of the Nicaean army, which itself was a fractured component of the formidable Komnenian army. Under the first Palaiologan emperor, Michael VIII, the army&#x27;s role took an increasingly offensive role whilst the naval forces of the Empire, weakened since the days of Andronikos I Komnenos, were boosted to include thousands of skilled sailors and some 80 ships. Due to the lack of land to support the army, the Empire required the use of large numbers of mercenaries.

After Andronikos II took to the throne, the army fell apart and the Byzantines suffered regular defeats at the hands of their eastern opponents, although they would continue to enjoy success against the crusader territories in Greece. By c. 1350, following a destructive civil war and the outbreak of the Black Death, the Empire was no longer capable of raising troops and the supplies to maintain them. The Empire came to rely upon troops provided by Serbs, Bulgarians, Venetians, Latins, Genoans and Ottoman Turks to fight the civil wars that lasted for the greater part of the 14th century, with the latter foe being the most successful in establishing a foothold in Thrace. The Ottomans swiftly expanded through the Balkans and cut off Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, from the surrounding land. The last decisive battle was fought by the Palaiologan army in 1453, when Constantinople was besieged and fell on 29 May. The last isolated remnants of the Byzantine state were conquered by 1461.

<text>The Fiat Dino (Type 135) was a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car produced by Fiat from 1966 to 1973. The Dino name refers to the Ferrari Dino V6 engine, produced by Fiat and installed in the cars to achieve the production numbers sufficient for Ferrari to homologate the engine for Formula 2 racing.

==History==
===Background===
The Dino road cars came to be because of Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s need to homologate a V6 engine for Formula 2 racing cars.
In 1965 the Commission Sportive Internationale de la FIA had drawn up new rules, to be enacted for the 1967 season. F2 engines were required to have no more than six cylinders, and to be derived from a production engine, from a road car homologated in the GT class and produced in at least 500 examples within 12 months.
Since a small manufacturer, like Ferrari was in the mid 60s, did not possess the production capacity to reach such quotas, an agreement was signed with Fiat and made public on 1 March 1965: Fiat would produce the 500 engines needed for the homologation, to be installed in a GT car which remained to be specified.

Dino was the nickname of Enzo&#x27;s son Alfredo Ferrari, who had died in 1956 and was credited with the concept for Ferrari&#x27;s Formula 2 V6 racing engine, believed to be designed by Vittorio Jano with a peculiar 65° angle between the cylinder banks. In his memory, V6-engined Ferrari sports prototype racing cars had been named Dino since the late 1950s.
The conversion of this racing engine for road use and series production was entrusted to the engineer Aurelio Lampredi, who had previously designed several 4-cylinder Ferrari engines. Interviewed in the early 1980s, Lampredi noted that &quot;things didn&#x27;t work out exactly as Ferrari had foreseen&quot;: Enzo Ferrari had counted on building the engines at Maranello, but Fiat&#x27;s management insisted on taking control of production, to avoid any breaks in the engine supply.
The resulting Fiat-built V6 ended up being installed in two very different vehicles: the Fiat Dino, a front-engined grand tourer assembled in Turin by Fiat, and in Ferrari&#x27;s first series-produced mid-engined sports car, built in Maranello and sold under the newly created Dino marque. Even on the cylinder block casting, the name FIAT was visible which was not in line with the newly created DINO make.

===Fiat Dino (1966–1969)===
The Fiat Dino was introduced as a 2-seater Spider at the Turin Motor Show in October 1966; a 2+2 Coupé version, built on a longer wheelbase, bowed a few months later at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1967. The two bodies showed very different lines, as they had been designed and were manufactured for Fiat by two different coachbuilders: the Spider by Pininfarina, and the Coupé by Bertone—where it had been sketched out by Giorgetto Giugiaro in 1963 and finished after his departure to Ghia by his replacement, Marcello Gandini. Curiously the Spider type approval identified it as a 2+1 seater. The Spider had poorer interior trim than the Coupé, below par for its class: the dashboard was covered in vinyl, the metal-spoke steering wheel had a plastic rim, and the interior switchgear was derived from cheaper Fiat models. After a few months this issue was addressed, and Spiders produced after February 1967 had a wood-rimmed steering wheel as well as a wood trim on the dashboard like the sister Coupé car had since the beginning.
Option lists for both models were limited to radio, metallic paint, leather upholstery, and for the Spider a vinyl-covered hardtop with roll-bar style stainless steel trim.

The car was offered with an all-aluminium DOHC 2.0 L V6, coupled to a 5-speed manual transmission. The same 2.0-litre engine was used in mid-engined, Ferrari-built Dino 206 GT, which was introduced in pre-production form at the 1967 Turin Motor Show and went on sale in 1968.
Fiat quoted for the Fiat Dino, while in 1967 Ferrari—presenting the first prototype of the Dino 206 GT—claimed despite both engines being made by Fiat workers in Turin on the same production line, without any discrimination as to their destination. Jean-Pierre Gabriel in &quot;Les Ferraris de Turin&quot; notes that, &quot;La declaration de Ferrari ne reposait sur aucun fondament technique&quot;—Ferrari&#x27;s statement had no technical basis.

===Fiat Dino 2400 (1969–1973)===

In 1969, both Ferrari and Fiat introduced new 2.4-litre Dino models. The Fiat Dino 2400 premiered in October 1969 at the Turin Motor show; besides the larger engine, another notable improvements was independent rear suspension.
The V6 now put out , and used a cast iron instead of the previous light alloy engine block; the same engine was installed on the Dino 246 GT, Ferrari&#x27;s evolution of the 206. Whereas the original Dino was equipped with a rigid axle suspended by leaf springs and 4 shock absorbers, 2.4-litre cars used a coil-sprung independent rear suspension with 2 shock absorbers derived from the Fiat 130. Rather than engine power and absolute speed, the most important consequence of the larger displacement was a marked increase in torque, available at lower engine speeds; the Dino 2400 had much better pickup, and it was found more usable, even in city traffic. Other modifications went on to improve the car&#x27;s drivability and safety: larger diameter clutch, new dogleg ZF gearbox with revised gear ratios, wider section Pirelli Cinturato tyres, and upsized brake discs and callipers.

Cosmetic changes were comparatively minor. Both models were now badged &quot;Dino 2400&quot;. On the coupé the previous silver honeycomb grille with the round Fiat logo on its centre had been replaced by a new black grille and a bonnet badge. A host of details were changed from chrome to matte black, namely part of the wheels, the vents on the front wings and the cabin ventilation outlets—the latter moved from next to the side windows to the rear window. At the rear there were different tail lights. The spider also sported a new grille with two horizontal chrome bars, five-bolt instead of knock-off wheels, as well as a new bumpers with rubber strips. Inside only the coupé received an entirely redesigned dashboard and new cloth seats, with optional leather seat upholstery; front seat headrests were standard on the coupé and optional on the spider.

===Production===
Spider and coupé bodies were produced respectively by Pininfarina and Bertone. 2.0-litre and early 2.4-litre cars were assembled by Fiat in Rivalta di Torino. Starting from December 1969 the Fiat Dino was assembled in Maranello on Ferrari&#x27;s production line, alongside the 246 GT. Between 1966 and 1969 there were 3,670 2.0-litre coupés and 1,163 2.0-litre spiders made; with only 420 built, the 2400 Spider is the rarest of the Fiat&#x27;s Dinos. Of the total 7,803 Fiat Dino produced, 74% were the popular coupés and only 26% were spiders.

==Specifications==
The Fiat Dino coupe used an all-steel unibody construction. The Spider had an aluminum trunk lid. The dual-circuit braking system with vacuum servo operated on four wheel disc brakes. The upgraded Girling brakes of the Dino 2400 were shared with sports cars like the De Tomaso Pantera and Lamborghini Miura. Steering was of the worm and roller type by French manufacturer Gemmer.

===Suspension===
Front suspension was of the double wishbone type. The upper wishbone consisted of a stamped steel control arm, the lower one of a stamped steel link and an adjustable forward radius rod. Coaxial coil springs and hydraulic dampers were attached to the upper wishbone; an anti-roll bar was fitted.

On 2.0-litre cars, the rear suspension consisted of a rigid axle on semi-elliptic springs (single-leaf on the spider, two-leaf on the coupé) and twin hydraulic dampers on each side. It was located by a longitudinal reaction strut on each side, linked to the axle at the front and to the aft leaf spring attachment point at the rear.

On 2.4-litre cars, the independent rear suspension consisted on each side of a long oblique stamped steel link (incorporating the spring seat) and a transverse link, attached to the same crossmember which supported the differential; there were coil springs, single hydraulic dampers and an anti-roll bar.

===Engines===

A peculiarity of Dino V6 engines was a 65° angle between the cylinder banks, instead of the usual 60°. The valvetrain consisted of 12 poppet valves timed by two chain-driven overhead camshafts. Compression ratio was 9:1 on both engines. Fuel was delivered via three twin-choke downdraught Weber Carburetors, normally 40 DCN 14 on 2.0 cars and 40 DCNF 12 on 2.4 cars.

The 2.0-litre V6 had bore and stroke respectively of and , for a total displacement of 1,986.6 cc. The engine block was alloy, with inserted special cast iron wet cylinder liners; cylinder heads were aluminium as well, with cast iron valve seats and hemispherical combustion chambers.
In 1968 the 2.0-litre Fiat Dino became the first car to have electronic ignition as standard. The Dinoplex C electronic capacitive discharge ignition was developed by Magneti Marelli expressly for the high-revving Dino V6 engine. Performance was impressive, with a 0–60 mph time of less than 8 seconds. Early Dino&#x27;s were later on equipped with the Dinoplex C ignition. Its primary function was to prevent fouling of the sparkplugs in town use.

The 2.4-litre V6 had bore and stroke respectively of and , for a total displacement of 2,418 cc. The redesigned engine block was cast iron.

===Transmission===
Both series cars used an all-synchromesh 5-speed manual transmission, with an hydraulic single-plate dry clutch (up-sized on the 2400), and a limited slip differential.
Two-litre Dinos used a transmission of Fiat&#x27;s own design. This was changed on the 2400 to a ZF-sourced S5-18/3 dog-leg gearbox, the same found on the Fiat 130 as well as on other manufacturers&#x27; cars.

==Motorsport==

The Fiat Dino was never raced officially, and only seldom by privateer drivers.
The one notable participation was at the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans, where a two-litre Spider was entered by the French Fiat-Abarth importer in the sports prototype class. Driven by Marcel Martin, Jean-André Mesange and Hubert Roche, it finished the race 18th overall.

==Concept cars==

The 1967 Fiat Dino Parigi was presented at the 1967 Paris Motor Show and named after this venue, applying the Kammback designs and a shooting brake body style. A year later, at the 1968 Geneva Motor Show Pininfarina showcased the Fiat Dino Ginevra, a specially bodied berlinetta based on Dino Spider mechanicals. Both concepts were designed by Paolo Martin.

<text>Laura Prepon ( ; born March 7, 1980) is an American actress and television director. She rose to fame with her role as Donna Pinciotti in the Fox sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (1998–2006). She is also known for portraying Alex Vause in the Netflix comedy-drama series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; (2013–2019). Prepon made her film debut in 2001 with the independent drama &quot;Southlander&quot;.

She was cast as Alex Vause, a former drug importer and girlfriend of Piper Chapman (Schilling). The series premiered on July 11, 2013. Prepon was a regular in the first season, but appeared in only four of the 13 episodes in the second season. She returned as a series regular in the third season.

In 2016, Prepon and nutritionist Elizabeth Troy co-wrote &quot;The Stash Plan&quot;, a wellness book that draws on Prepon&#x27;s experiences eating organic foods since she was a child, and her struggles with weight, low energy, and digestive issues. The book debuted at No. 10 under &quot;Advice, How-To &amp; Miscellaneous&quot; on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Since publishing &quot;The Stash Plan&quot;, Prepon has expanded her cooking career, launching a line of kitchenware products called PrepOn Kitchen and regularly posting instructional videos online.

In 2016, Prepon appeared in the psychological thriller &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;, based on Paula Hawkins&#x27; novel of the same name. In 2017, she played Charlotte opposite Sam Elliott in &quot;The Hero&quot;. Prepon directed the tenth episode of &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;″s fifth season, titled &quot;The Reverse Midas Touch&quot;. On April 30, 2022, it was announced that Prepon would have a guest appearance in the follow-up sitcom, &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot;. &quot;That 90&#x27;s Show&quot; debuted January 19, 2023 on Netflix.

==Personal life==
Prepon was in a relationship with Christopher Masterson, Danny Masterson&#x27;s brother, from 1999 to 2007. She later dated Scott Michael Foster for several years, but said in 2013 they had broken up.

In August 2017, Prepon gave birth to her and fiancé actor Ben Foster&#x27;s daughter. Prepon and Foster married in June 2018. Their second child, a son, was born in February 2020. Ben Foster filed for divorce from Prepon on November 12, 2024, citing “irreconcilable differences”.

<text>The United Kennel Club (UKC) is a kennel club founded in 1898 in the United States. In contrast with the American Kennel Club, which is non-profit and which only clubs can join, the United Kennel Club is a profit-making corporation, open to individuals.

The UKC is not recognised by the International Canine Federation.

==History==

UKC was founded by Chauncey Z. Bennett, on February 10, 1898, after feeling that other dog registries in existence at the time catered too much to Conformation-only show dog owners or wealthy hobbyists, whom he called &quot;the big city idle rich&quot;. Bennett&#x27;s goal for UKC was to be a registry that recognized a wide range of breeds, as opposed to some of the working dog registries, which only recognized a handful of breeds. He envisioned UKC-registered dogs occupying a wide range of uses, from working, to companionship, to hunting. Bennett found a niche among the owners of working dogs, such as herding and hunting dogs.

The first dog registered with UKC was an American Pit Bull Terrier, Bennett&#x27;s own dog, named Bennett&#x27;s Ring. This also made UKC the first registry to recognize the breed.

Starting in 1905, UKC began publishing a journal called &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, devoted to purebred dogs of all kinds. The journal continued to grow, and in 1974, the journal would split into two distinct magazines. Coonhound Bloodlines would devote itself to the UKC-recognized Coonhound breeds, while Bloodlines, devoted to all breeds, would continue to publish until it was discontinued in 2015. Coonhound Bloodlines continues to this day.

Bennett continued to run UKC out of his home until his death in 1936. Upon his death, The New York Herald Tribune credited Bennett with developing breeds such as &quot;the American Eskimo, the Columbian (white) Collie, the Redbone Coonhound, American Water Spaniel, American (Pit) Bull Terrier, and the American Fox and Coon Hound.&quot;

After Bennett&#x27;s death, his daughter Frances Ruth Bennett took over management of the company, and in 1944, she and husband Dr. Edwin Gould Fuhrman moved operations at UKC into the Hanselman Building in Kalamazoo. Operations would continue there for less than a decade before moving to a new space in Kalamazoo, where they would remain until 1979.

In the early 1970s, the Fuhrmans opted to give up leadership in the company, and in January 1973, UKC announced the sale to businessman Fred Miller, who would take over as president. Miller oversaw a shift to computerization for UKC records in the mid-1970s, and by 1978, UKC was the first known dog registry in the world to computerize all its registration records.

In January 1979, Miller announced that UKC would be moving to what would become their current offices in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The company would occupy the new building in March of that year.

In the 1980s UKC added Obedience as a performance sport, and in 1984, UKC partnered with the newly formed Hunting Retriever Club to create a new format of field trials for hunters. The partnership also saw UKC begin publication on what was at the time a third magazine, Hunting Retriever Magazine, which continues to this day.

In April 1996, UKC became the first All-Breed dog registry to offer a DNA program, which it opened up to dogs from other registries in March 1997.

In March 2000, Miller died, and leadership shifted to vice president and General Manager Wayne Cavanaugh. Cavanaugh continued to digitize and modernize UKC, adding and developing a variety of new performance sports, and launching the company website in April 2008.

In July 2014, with Cavanaugh getting ready to pursue retirement, UKC VP of Operations Tanya Raab was named UKC President. Cavanaugh would continue with the organization until officially retiring in October 2015.

Raab&#x27;s tenure as president saw the development of a few more performance sports, and the onset of a new hunting sport in the Elite Shed Dog Series. In October 2018, Raab announced that she would be stepping down as president, though she would remain involved with the company in other capacities.

UKC continues to operate out of Kalamazoo, licensing more than 16,000 events every year across the United States. The registry currently recognizes over 370 breeds of dogs. In September 2021, the company announced that it had come to an agreement to acquire American Field Publishing Company, including its Field Dog Stud Book, specializing in upland field trials for pointing dogs and field trial breeding records.

===Presidents===

* Chauncey Z. Bennett (founder, and president from 1898 to 1936) initiated the system of numbering the registered dogs. The first dog registered, UKC Number 1, was Bennett&#x27;s American Pit Bull Terrier, Bennett&#x27;s Ring.
* Frances Bennett Fuhrman (president from 1936 to 1944), daughter of Chauncey Bennett, improved the editorial content and appearance of the UKC magazine, &quot;Bloodlines&quot;.
* E. G. Fuhrman (president from 1944 to 1973), husband of Frances Fuhrman and son-in-law to Chauncey Bennett, promoted dog shows and introduced the four types of UKC coonhound events: bench shows, night hunts, field trials, and water races.
* Fred T. Miller (president from 1973 to 2000), took many steps towards modernization, which improved customer service and turnaround time on registration applications.
* Wayne R. Cavanaugh (president from 2000 to 2014), furthered UKC&#x27;s mission as a proactive and performance-based registry where the health and vitality of each breed were at the forefront of all decisions and advancements. Cavanaugh was chairman of the board from 2014 until his retirement in October 2015.
* Tanya Raab (president from 2014 to 2018), had been with the organization since 1989, and was promoted at the time of Cavanaugh&#x27;s resignation.
* Jeff Nicholson (president and owner from 2018 to present), Jeff Nicholson took over UKC, according to Michigans Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, and is also the owner of a large development company in Kalamazoo Michigan called PlazaCorp. Jeff Nicholson is not involved in the day-to-day operations of UKC.

== &#x27;Total Dog&#x27; Philosophy ==
UKC stresses the value of what they call the &quot;Total Dog&quot;. It refers to a dog which displays &quot;equal parts function, temperament, and structure,&quot; and is used to showcase dogs that look as their breed should in Conformation shows, but also are able to excel at performance sports that utilize skills for which they were bred.

UKC awards a Total Dog Award to dogs at All-Breed Sports events which earn a win in Conformation as well as an eligible Performance Sport on the same day, demonstrating both form and function. However, only limited regional qualifiers are offered annually, and those are chosen at whim. Dogs must qualify at a regional qualifier to receive an invite to the national.

== Positions ==
Very early on, UKC began to stake out positions on topics of the day pertaining to dogs and dog law. Beginning in February 1936, the UKC journal &quot;Bloodlines&quot; ran a regular column discussing the cruelty of the practice of vivisection. The first article referenced the conditions in which the famous Pavlov dogs were kept, as well as other experiments being performed on dogs. This regular column would continue to run through the early 1940s.

UKC also maintains position statements on a variety of topics pertinent to dog law, documenting the company&#x27;s opposition to Breed Specific Legislation, mandatory spay and neuter laws, blanket anti-tethering laws, and its desire to steer potential dog owners toward purchasing dogs from responsible breeders.

A section of the company website remains devoted to dog law, with tips to get involved, and links to contact lawmakers.

==Programs==
United Kennel Club&#x27;s two main programs are called Hunting Operations and All-Breed Sports. Hunting Operations runs six separate types of competitive hunt, generally based on the breed of dog, while All-Breed Sports runs ten different performance sports, that are open to—as the name suggests—all breeds.

===Hunting Programs===

==== Coonhounds ====

===== Hunting =====
The first organized Coonhound field trial was held in Marion, Ohio, in 1924. The first unofficial UKC Nite Hunt was held in 1953 in Ingraham, Illinois.

In 1960, UKC held the first Autumn Oaks event, at which the organization crowns a National Grand Nite Champion yearly.

In 1978, UKC launched Coonhound World Championship, to crown a World Nite Hunt Champion. The event continued to grow, and UKC instituted a zone semifinal system in the late 1980s, with qualifying dogs hunting in one of four zones to earn their way to the Finals. In 1992, the number of zones expanded to five. Today, there are seven zones, accommodating hundreds of dogs.

===== Bench Show =====
A Bench Show is essentially a Conformation show for Coonhounds. The dogs are placed on a two-foot high platform to assist the judge in their examination of the dog for adherence to breed standards. The first UKC licensed Bench Show for Coonhounds occurred in 1946, at the National Leafy Oak Field Trial, in Kenton, Ohio. Today, UKC licenses thousands of bench shows a year across the country. The organization also crowns National Bench Show Champions yearly at Autumn Oaks, and a World Bench Show Champion at the yearly Coonhound World Championship event.

==== Beagles ====
Though promoting Beagles in &quot;Bloodlines&quot; as far back as 1913, the first UKC-licensed Beagle Field Trial did not take place until 1924. In 1988, UKC met with Beaglers across the country to develop the UKC Hunting Beagle format, with the first event taking place in 1990.

Currently, UKC runs the Hunting Beagle Nationals, established in 1992, and the Hunting Beagle World Championship, established in 2000. Both events feature a Hunt and Bench Show portion.

In 2021, UKC paired with the Beagle Gundog Alliance to develop a new format, the Beagle Gundog program. This format held its first national event that same year.

==== Hunting Retrievers ====
In the early 1980s, UKC held a series of meetings with several prominent voices in the Hunting Retriever field, about an arrangement to create a new format of field trial for retrievers. This became the Hunting Retriever Club, which was quickly affiliated with UKC.

In April 1984, the first Hunting Retriever Club and UKC hunt was held in Ruston, Louisiana. The first Grand Hunt, was established in 1986, as dogs quickly reached the title of Hunting Retriever Champion, and had no higher levels to reach. In October 1986, the first Grand Hunt was held, and in the years since, there has been a Grand Hunt every fall and every spring.

With the development of Hunting Retriever Club came a new publication for United Kennel Club, &quot;Hunting Retriever Magazine&quot;, the first issue of which was published in August 1984.

==== Cur &amp; Feists ====
The UKC Cur &amp; Feist program began in 2000, with the first events being held toward the end of the year. The Cur and Feist breeds are smaller dogs, most often used to hunt squirrel and other small game. Over the two decades of the program&#x27;s existence, UKC has developed World Championships for both Cur Squirrel Dog and Feist Squirrel Dog, and holds licensed bench shows.

==== Upland Hunting ====
The first UKC-licensed pointing dog trial was held in April 2004, by the French Brittany Gundog Club (which would later become Club de l’Epagneul Breton of the United States or CEB-US). The event was held in Armour, South Dakota and consisted of a conformation show and two distinct field trials. Since that event, UKC has continued to host pointing dog field trials with clubs across the country. In 2021, UKC announced that it had acquired American Field Publishing Company, including the Field Dog Stud Book, the oldest purebred dog registry in the United States.

==== Elite Shed Dog Series ====
The UKC Elite Shed Dog Series was created in 2017, to provide a family-friendly format for those who enjoy participating in the gathering of shed antlers—or shed hunting. The first UKC Elite Shed Dog National event was held in April 2020 in Whittington, Illinois.

=== All-Breed Sports Programs ===
The UKC All-Breed Sports Department operates ten performance sports, as well as the SPOT (Socialized Pet Obedience Test) program.

==== Agility ====
In Agility, a dog and handler race to complete a specially designed obstacle course involving tunnels, bridges, and jumps. The event is timed to measure speed of completion, and accuracy is also taken into consideration.

The first UKC-licensed Agility trial was held in July 1995, after the National Club for Dog Agility transferred the program to United Kennel Club.

==== Conformation ====
Conformation is the official term for a dog show, referring specifically to the external and visible details of a dog&#x27;s build and structure. The preferred details are written out in each breed&#x27;s standards, which are published and held by each registry.

UKC began to license Conformation Dog Shows in the 1920s, with the first annual UKC Bench Show held in May 1926.

==== Dock Jumping ====
In Dock Jumping (called Dock Diving in AKC), dogs jump off the end of a standard length dock, usually jumping for distance, though some classes feature high jumps or working to fetch a bumper.

UKC announced Dock Jumping as a licensed event in 2007.

==== Drag Racing ====
Drag Racing features dogs who meet the height requirement, racing in a straight-line course, and in the case of Steeplechase, clearing small hurdles during the run. Flat racing does not include these hurdles.

UKC began to license Drag Racing in 2004, at the time called Terrier Racing.

In April 2014, UKC rechristened the event Drag Racing, opening it up to all breeds 18 inches or under in height.

==== Lure Coursing ====
Lure Coursing features dogs pursuing an artificial lure around a predetermined course. The UKC Lure Coursing rule book lays out 26 breeds which may participate in the regular stakes race, while any breed can participate in a coursing aptitude test. The recommended field size for the race is approximately 200 yards by 300 yards, while the minimum field size is set at 150 yards by 200 yards.

UKC announced the addition of Lure Coursing in May 2010.

==== Nosework ====
Nosework (knows as scentwork in AKC) is modeled after working detection dogs, and challenges dogs to recognize a specific, trained odor, such as birch, anise, clove, myrrh, and vetiver, and then indicate to their handler that they have located that odor in a variety of locations, and elements.

UKC began to officially license Nosework events in 2015.

==== Obedience ====
In Obedience trials, dogs perform a series of exercises at the command of their handler, the complexity of which varies by competition level, from the basics of sit, stay, heel, to more advanced exercises like directed retrieves and following hand signals.

The UKC Obedience Program began in 1977.

==== Precision Coursing ====
In Precision Coursing, dogs of all breeds race the clock as they pursue a lure over a 150-foot track through an enclosed course.

UKC announced the launch of Precision Coursing in May 2020.

==== Rally Obedience ====
Similar to Obedience, Rally Obedience also tests a dog&#x27;s ability to perform basic obedience exercises, but in Rally, the pace is quicker as the sequence of exercises is indicated by a series of instructional and directional signs placed throughout the course.

UKC announced the addition of Rally Obedience in 2008.

==== SPOT ====
Developed in 2016, the Socialized Pet Obedience Test is designed to help encourage dogs and owners to set an example for responsible dog ownership, by learning appropriate behavior while on-leash and in the presence of other dogs. The SPOT test consists of 10 separate stations. At each station the dog must perform a basic exercise. These exercises are used to demonstrate that the dog is capable of exhibiting desired behaviors that the general public would expect to see in a well-behaved dog.

==== Weight Pull ====
In Weight Pull, dogs are harnessed to a weighted cart or sled and given one minute to pull a predetermined distance of 16 feet. The weight to be pulled is variable based on the weight of the dog itself.

UKC added Weight Pull to its list of events in 2002, with the first event being held in Montana in February 2002.

==UKC championship==
For the United Kennel Club Championship (UKC Ch), a combination of points (for example, winning the class earns 10 points in non-variety breeds, 5 in variety breeds) and competition wins (including group placements and Best In Show/Reserve Best in Multi-Breed Show) are required. In UKC, a dog must receive 100 points with at least three competition wins under three different judges. A competition win is when a dog wins best male, best female, or best of winners over a least one other dog and receives points accordingly. A UKC &quot;Grand Champion&quot; (GRCh) title is earned by winning in competition over 2 other Champions and/or Grand Champions of the breed in at least five shows under at least three different judges. In Jan 2019, UKC added 4 Grand Champion levels — Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire and Diamond.

<text>The calends or kalends () is the first day of every month in the Roman calendar. The English word &quot;calendar&quot; is derived from this word.

== Use ==
The Romans called the first day of every month the &quot;calends&quot;, signifying the start of a new lunar phase. On this day, the pontiffs would announce the number of days until the next month at the Curia Calabra; in addition, debtors had to pay off their debts on this day. These debts were inscribed in the &quot;kalendaria&quot;, effectively an accounting book. 

Modern calendars count the number of days &quot;after&quot; the first of each month; by contrast, the Roman calendar counted the number of days &quot;until&quot; certain upcoming dates (such as the calends, the nones or the ides). The day before the calends was called &quot;pridie kalendas&quot;, but the day before that was counted as the &quot;third day&quot;, as Romans used inclusive counting. 

To calculate the day of the calends of the upcoming month, counting the number of days remaining in the current month is necessary, then adding two to that number. For example, April 22 is the 10th day before the calends of May (ante diem decimum Kalendas Maius), because eight days are left in April and both end dates are included in the total.

== Computation ==
The following lines of poetry aid calculations relating to the day of the month from the calends:

This means that the first day is called the &quot;calends&quot;; six days after the calends is the &quot;nones&quot; of May, October, July and March, while the nones comes only four days later for the other months; the &quot;ides&quot; comes eight days after the nones. 

== Expressions ==
The calends was a feature of the Roman calendar, but it was not included in the Greek calendar. Consequently, to postpone something &quot;ad Kalendas Graecas&quot; (&quot;until the Greek calends&quot;) was a colloquial expression for postponing something forever. This phrase survived for many centuries in Greek () and in the Romance languages (; ; ; ; ; etc.).

The Latin term is traditionally written with initial &quot;K&quot;: this is a relic of traditional Latin orthography, which wrote &quot;K&quot; (instead of &quot;C&quot; or &quot;Q&quot;) before the vowel &quot;A&quot;. Later, most Latin words adopted &quot;C&quot;, instead. It is sometimes claimed that the kalends was frequently used in formal or high-register contexts, and that that is why it retained its traditional spelling, but there seems to be no source for this.

<text>&quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot; is a British patriotic hymn, created in 1921 when music by Gustav Holst had a poem by Sir Cecil Spring Rice set to it. The music originated as a wordless melody, which Holst later named &quot;Thaxted&quot;, taken from the &quot;Jupiter&quot; movement of Holst&#x27;s 1917 suite &quot;The Planets&quot;.

==History==
The origin of the hymn&#x27;s text is a poem by diplomat Sir Cecil Spring Rice, written in 1908 or 1912, entitled &quot;&quot;&quot; (&quot;The City of God&quot;) or &quot;The Two Fatherlands&quot;. The poem describes how a Christian owes his loyalties to his homeland and the heavenly kingdom. 
In 1908, Spring Rice was posted to the British Embassy in Stockholm. In 1912, he was appointed as Ambassador to the United States of America, where he influenced the administration of Woodrow Wilson to abandon neutrality and join Britain in the war against Germany. After the United States entered the war, he was recalled to Britain. Shortly before he departed from the US in January 1918, he rewrote and renamed &quot;&quot;&quot;, significantly altering the first verse to concentrate on the themes of love and sacrifice rather than &quot;the noise of battle&quot; and &quot;the thunder of her guns&quot;, creating a more sombre tone because of the loss of life suffered in the Great War. The first verse in both versions invokes Britain (in the 1912 version, anthropomorphised as Britannia with sword and shield; in the second version, simply called &quot;my country&quot;); the second verse, the Kingdom of Heaven.

According to Sir Cecil&#x27;s granddaughter, the rewritten verse of 1918 was never intended to appear alongside the first verse of the original poem but was replacing it; the original first verse is nevertheless sometimes known as the &quot;rarely sung middle verse&quot;. The text of the original poem was sent by Spring Rice to William Jennings Bryan in a letter shortly before his death in February 1918.

The poem circulated privately for a few years until it was set to music by Holst, to a tune he adapted from his &quot;Jupiter&quot; to fit the poem&#x27;s words. 
It was performed as a unison song with orchestra in the early 1920s, and it was finally published as a hymn in 1925/6 in the &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; hymnal (no. 188).

It was included in later hymnals, including:
==Tune==

In 1921, Gustav Holst adapted the music from a section of &quot;Jupiter&quot; from his suite &quot;The Planets&quot; to create a setting for the poem. The music was extended slightly to fit the final two lines of the first verse. At the request of the publisher Curwen, Holst made a version as a unison song with orchestra (Curwen also published Sir Hubert Parry&#x27;s unison song with orchestra, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;). This was probably first performed in 1921 and became a common element at Armistice memorial ceremonies, especially after it was published as a hymn in 1926.

In 1926, Holst harmonised the tune to make it usable as a hymn, which was included in the hymnal &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;. In that version, the lyrics were unchanged, but the tune was then called &quot;Thaxted&quot; (named after the village where Holst lived for many years). The editor of the new (1926) edition of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; was Holst&#x27;s close friend Ralph Vaughan Williams, which may have provided the stimulus for Holst&#x27;s cooperation in producing the hymn. Vaughan Williams himself composed an alternative tune to the words, &quot;Abinger&quot;, which was included in the enlarged edition of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; but is very rarely used.

Holst&#x27;s daughter Imogen recorded that, at &quot;the time when he was asked to set these words to music, Holst was so over-worked and over-weary that he felt relieved to discover they &#x27;fitted&#x27; the tune from &quot;Jupiter&quot;&quot;.

&lt;score&gt;\relative f&#x27; { \time 3/4 \key c \major \partial 4 e8( g) a4. c8 b8. g16 c8( d) c4 b a8 b a4 g e2 } \addlyrics { I __ vow to thee, my coun -- try, all earth -- ly things a -- bove }&lt;/score&gt;

==Lyrics==
The hymn as printed in &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; (1925) consisted only of the two stanzas of the 1918 version, credited &quot;Words: Cecil Spring-Rice, 1918; Music: Thaxted&quot;, as follows:
The final line of the second stanza is based on Proverbs , &quot;Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace&quot; (KJV), in the context of which the feminine pronoun refers to Wisdom.

The original first stanza of Spring-Rice&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot;Urbs Dei&quot;/&quot;The Two Father Lands&quot; (1908–1912), never set to music, was as follows:
==Contemporary use==
First performed in 1921, it is still associated with Remembrance Day services all over the Commonwealth of Nations. The hymn was used at the funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965. Diana, Princess of Wales, requested that the hymn be sung at her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981, saying that it had &quot;always been a favourite since schooldays&quot;. It was also sung at her funeral in 1997 and her tenth-year memorial service in 2007. It was sung at the funeral of Baroness Thatcher on 17 April 2013. Julian Mitchell&#x27;s 1981 play &quot;Another Country&quot; and its 1984 film version derive their titles from the words of the second stanza.

==Reception==
In August 2004, Stephen Lowe, Bishop of Hulme criticised the hymn in a diocese newsletter, calling it &quot;heretical&quot; because of its nationalist overtones.

In 2013, an Anglican vicar said that the hymn could be regarded as &quot;obscene&quot; for misrepresenting the teachings of Christ and urging on unquestioning obedience when asked to kill other human beings.

&quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot; was voted as the UK&#x27;s sixth favourite hymn in a 2019 poll by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;.

<text>The Chicago Fire Department (CFD) provides firefighting services along with emergency medical response services, hazardous materials mitigation services, and technical rescue response services in the city of Chicago, Illinois, United States, under the jurisdiction of the mayor of Chicago. The Chicago Fire Department is the second-largest municipal fire department in the United States after the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). It is also one of the oldest major organized fire departments in the nation. It has numerous general purpose and specialized vehicles and equipment to accomplish its missions.

The Chicago Fire Department is led by the fire commissioner, currently Annette Nance-Holt. The Fire Commissioner is appointed by the mayor of Chicago, is confirmed by the Chicago City Council, and is assisted by the First Deputy Commissioner, who oversees the department&#x27;s bureaus. There are four bureaus under the command of the First Deputy Commissioner: Operations, Fire Prevention, Administrative Services, and Logistics.

The Chicago Fire Department receives over 800,000 emergency calls annually.

==History==

The &quot;Washington Volunteers,&quot; the first fire company, was established in 1832.

The first Chicago regulation, which forbade &quot;the passing of any stove pipe through the roof, partition, or siding of any building, unless guarded by tin or iron six inches from the wood,&quot; was passed in November 1833. For this infraction, there was a $5.00 fine.
The volunteer fire department was disestablished on August 2, 1858, when the city council passed the ordinance organizing the paid City of Chicago Fire Department.

==Organization==
===Bureaus===
There are four Bureaus within the Chicago Fire Department: Bureau of Operations, Bureau of Administrative Services, Bureau of Logistics and Bureau of Fire Prevention. Each of the four Bureaus are commanded by a Deputy Fire Commissioner, who then reports to the 1st Deputy Fire Commissioner, who in turn reports to the Fire Commissioner.

====Bureau of Operations====
The Bureau of Operations is the largest Bureau within the Chicago Fire Department. The Bureau of Operations commands the following Divisions: Fire Suppression &amp; Rescue, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), Special Operations Command, and the Office of Fire Investigation (OFI). The Bureau of Operations is composed of over 4,500 Uniformed Firefighters and EMS personnel and is commanded by a Deputy Fire Commissioner

The Fire Suppression and Rescue Division is organized into 5 Districts which command a total of 24 Battalions and 1 Special Operations Battalion.

====Bureau Of Administrative Services====
The Bureau of Administrative Services commands the following Divisions: Personnel, Training, the Photo Unit, and the Employee Assistance Program. The Bureau Of Administrative Services is commanded by a Deputy Fire Commissioner.

====Bureau of Logistics====
The Bureau of Logistics commands the following Divisions: Support Services, Support &amp; Logistics (EMS), Equipment &amp; Supply, Building &amp; Property Management, Record, Employee Relations, Labor Relations, Staff/Human Relations, the Pension Board, the Regulatory Compliance, and Management Information Systems/Technology. The Bureau of Logistics is commanded by a Deputy Fire Commissioner.

====Bureau of Fire Prevention====
The Bureau of Fire Prevention commands the following Divisions: Code Compliance and Inspections. The Bureau of Fire Prevention is commanded by a Deputy Fire Commissioner.

==Operations==
The Bureau of Operations is one of four Bureaus within the organization of the Chicago Fire Department. Like the other Bureaus, the Bureau of Operations is commanded by a Deputy Fire Commissioner, who reports to the 1st Deputy Commissioner, who in-turn reports to the Fire Commissioner. The Bureau of Operations is currently the largest Bureau within the Chicago Fire Department and is organized into four Divisions: Fire Suppression and Rescue, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), Special Operations (including the Technical Rescue Unit, the Hazardous Materials Unit, and the Air-Sea Rescue Unit), and the Office of Fire Investigation (OFI). The Fire Suppression and Rescue Division is commanded by an Assistant Deputy Fire Commissioner. The Special Operations Division and the EMS Division are also commanded by an Assistant Deputy Commissioner. The Office of Fire Investigation (OFI) is under the command of the Commanding Fire Marshal, equivalent to the rank of Deputy District Chief.
==Fire station locations and apparatus==
The Chicago Fire Department is organized into 5 Districts, which command a total of 24 Battalions and a Special Operations Battalion.

==In popular culture==
The Chicago Fire Department cooperated with film director Ron Howard on making the 1991 film &quot;Backdraft&quot;, starring Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, and Robert De Niro.

The NBC television show &quot;Chicago Fire&quot;, centers on a group of fictional firefighters and paramedics at a firehouse that is the headquarters of the fictitious Engine Company 51, Truck Company 81, Rescue Squad Company 3, Battalion Chief 25 (previously reassigned to another firehouse, now returned to Firehouse 51), Deputy District Chief 2-2-6 (reassigned to another Firehouse), and Ambulance 61 (represented by the headquarters for real Engine Company 18).

The arcade game Emergency Call Ambulance takes place in Chicago. Players would take the role of an unnamed Chicago Fire Department Paramedic and ambulance driver, as they race through Chicago streets to save lives in 4 different cases.

<text>Cinerama is an English indie pop band, headed up by David Gedge, the frontman for The Wedding Present. The band is known for combining rock guitar music with string and woodwind sounds.

==Career==
Originally formed in 1998, Cinerama began as a duo comprising David Gedge and Sally Murrell. Initial releases were stylistically different from The Wedding Present, featuring soundtrack-like arrangements with string and woodwind accompaniment. Live performances included the many musicians required to create the orchestral accompaniment present in the recordings. Over time the band&#x27;s sound returned to rock, with songs originally recorded by The Wedding Present incorporated into Cinerama&#x27;s live set.

During the recording of the album that became &quot;Take Fountain&quot;, Gedge decided that the band&#x27;s sound had changed so much that the album should be released as The Wedding Present.

== Post 2004 ==
Most Wedding Present set lists during this time included at least one Cinerama song.

The band played and recorded occasionally and performed a short set at each of David Gedge&#x27;s &quot;At the edge of..&quot; festivals. The line up usually comprised the current Wedding Present lineup but with the musicians switching their usual instruments.

On 18 May 2015, Cinerama released a re-vamped version of the Wedding Present&#x27;s album &quot;Valentina&quot;. The re-recording of a Wedding Present long player by Cinerama had been a long-term ambition of David Gedge. In December 2024 Cinerama released a re-recording of their debut album, this time titled Va Va Voom 25, and featuring full band re-recordings made in 2023/24.

<text>&quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; (also known as &quot;Proud to Be an American&quot;) is an American patriotic song written and recorded by American country singer Lee Greenwood, and is considered to be his signature song. Released by MCA Nashville on May 21, 1984, it appeared on Greenwood&#x27;s third album, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Good Love Comin&#x27;.&quot; It debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles. 

That summer, the song was included in a film about President Ronald Reagan, the Republican presidential nominee, that was shown at the 1984 Republican National Convention. &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; gained prominence during the 1988 United States presidential election campaign, when Greenwood performed the song at the 1988 Republican National Convention and at rallies for the Republican nominee, George H. W. Bush. The song was also featured in television advertisements for Bush. The song became popular once more during the Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. As a result of its newfound popularity, Greenwood re-recorded the track for his 1992 album &quot;American Patriot.&quot;

The popularity of the song surged following the September 11 attacks and during the 2003 invasion of Iraq; after the former, the song was re-released as a single and peaked at number 16 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts in 2001. A re-recorded version of the song was released in 2003, under the &quot;God Bless the U.S.A. 2003.&quot; The song platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)—signifying 1,000,000 units sold—by July 2015. The song experienced further popularity after another Republican president Donald Trump used it at campaign rallies. 

==Background and writing==
Greenwood wrote &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; in response to his feelings about the shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. He said that he &quot;wanted to write it my whole life. When I got to that point, we were doing 300 days a year on the road, and we were on our fourth or fifth album on MCA. I called my producer, and I said I have a need to do this. I&#x27;ve always wanted to write a song about America, and I said we just need to be more united.&quot; As for writing the song itself, Greenwood wrote that it more or less &quot;wrote itself&quot;, and that the lyrics flowed naturally from the music as a reflection of his pride to be American.

The reason behind the cities chosen in the song Greenwood says, &quot;I&#x27;m from California, and I don&#x27;t know anybody from Virginia or New York, so when I wrote it—and my producer and I had talked about it—[we] talked about the four cities I wanted to mention, the four corners of the United States. It could have been Seattle or Miami but we chose New York City and Los Angeles, and he suggested Detroit and Houston because they both were economically part of the basis of our economy—Motortown and the oil industry, so I just poetically wrote that in the bridge.&quot;

==Content==
In the song, the singer sings about how, if he were to lose everything he had and had to start again from scratch, he would do it in the United States because he believes his freedom is guaranteed in America. He remembers how other Americans in history had died to secure this freedom, and declares that if he is ever called upon to defend the US today, he will gladly stand up and fight because he loves the country.

==Music video==
A music video was released for this song in 1984, depicting Greenwood as a farmer who loses the family farm. The video was produced and edited by L. A. Johnson and directed by Gary Burden. A second video was released in 1991, also on VHS, and was directed by Edd Griles. A third music video was also released after the September 11, 2001, attacks. A fourth music video in collaboration with U.S. Air Force Singing Sergeants and a cappella group Home Free was released on June 30, 2020.

==Chart history==
&quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; debuted on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart for the week of May 26, 1984.
==Certifications==

==Other notable versions==
===Canadian version===
In 1989, Greenwood released a Canadian version of this song called &quot;God Bless You, Canada&quot;.

===Jump5 version===
Pop group Jump5 covered the song for the September 11 attacks in October 2001, altering some of the lyrics: &quot;I thank my lucky stars&quot; became &quot;I thank my God above&quot; to reflect the group&#x27;s Christian values, and &quot;I had to start again with just my children and my wife&quot; became &quot;I had to start again with just my family by my side&quot;.

===Dolly Parton version===
Dolly Parton recorded the song for her 2003 patriotic album, &quot;For God and Country&quot;. Altering the lyric: &quot;And I had to start again with just my children and my wife&quot; to &quot;And I had to start again with just my family by my side&quot;.

===&quot;American Idol&quot; finalists&#x27; version===
In 2003, the song was performed by the &quot;American Idol&quot; season two finalists and released as a single, with part of the proceeds going to the American Red Cross. It raised $155,000 for the charity. It reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and it was certified gold by the RIAA the same year.

===Beyoncé version===
Again, following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyoncé re-released her 2008 cover of the song, the proceeds of which would go to charity. She performed the song on &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot; on May 5, 2011. After the performance, her version was released as a single to the iTunes Store. In a statement she said, &quot;I cannot think about anything more appropriate to do to help these families ... Almost 10 years [after 9/11], it is still so painful for all Americans, especially those who lost loved ones. We were all affected by the tragedies of 9/11 and continue to keep the families who lost loved ones close to our hearts ...&quot; Dan Martin of &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt that the cover was &quot;in contrast&quot; to her last intervention in national affairs, the Let&#x27;s Move! Flash Workout fitness initiative. Ronald Mitchell of &quot;Newsday&quot; commented that &quot;It does our hearts good to see Beyoncé work her magic for the greater good.&quot; She later also performed the song for the concert she had on July 4, 2011, along with &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; (2011). Nick Neyland of &quot;Prefix Magazine&quot; commented that &quot;Beyoncé is a natural fit for occasions like this, and she doesn&#x27;t even break a sweat as she hits the high notes despite the soaring temperatures and humidity in the city. That&#x27;s the mark of a true pro.&quot; In Beyoncé&#x27;s version, the end of the second verse is sung &quot;And it&#x27;s time to make a change&quot;, as well as changing, &quot;If I had to start again with just my children and my wife&quot; to &quot;family by my side.&quot;

===Home Free version===
Country a cappella group Home Free has been performing the song ever since the band&#x27;s inception in 2000, and released an official music video on June 30, 2016. As of June 26, 2020, the music video has amassed 11 million views on YouTube. In 2020, Home Free worked in the studio with Greenwood and re-recorded the song with him and the United States Air Force Band Singing Sergeants. The music was released on July 1 on Home Free&#x27;s channel.

===Rock version===
Greenwood released a rock version of the song with fellow country artist Drew Jacobs on November 1st 2024 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the song and the victory of Donald Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election. The song opened at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Digital Song Sales chart following the election.

==&quot;God Bless The U.S.A.&quot; Bible==

In 2024, Greenwood and President Donald Trump collaborated to release themed King James Bibles &quot;inspired by&quot; the song. Each Bible includes &quot;the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence and the Pledge of Allegiance, as well as a handwritten chorus of the famous Greenwood song&quot;. The associated website claims that the Bible is &quot;not political&quot; or linked to his ongoing presidential campaign, but also describes it as the only Bible endorsed by Trump.
