<text>Vila do Conde (, ; &quot;the Count&#x27;s Town&quot;) is a municipality in the Norte Region of Portugal. The population in 2011 was 79,533, in an area of 149.03 km2. The urbanized area of Vila do Conde, which includes the parishes of Vila do Conde, Azurara and Árvore, represent 36,137 inhabitants. Vila do Conde is interlinked to the north with Póvoa de Varzim, forming a single urban agglomeration which is a part of the Porto Metropolitan Area. The town is on the Portuguese Way of the Camino de Santiago.

==History==

Vila do Conde is one of the oldest settlements in northern Portugal. Geological artifacts dating to the Paleolithic have been discovered in sites in the parishes of Modivas, Malta, and Labruge dating from 100,000 to 15,000 years. In other parishes there have also been discoveries of implements and mounds dating back to the Bronze Age and Neolithic periods indicating a period of transition between forging and sedimentary civilizations.

Its origins date back to the founding of the Portuguese territory; the earliest written document (953), by the Countess Mumadona Dias, refers to the &quot;Villa de Comite&quot;, in a chart used for the sale of land by Flamula Pelagius, to the Monastery of Guimarães. But its ancient origins date back to the Castro of São João (Hillfort of St. John), and other Iron Age castros, that include dispersed settlements in Retorta, Bagunte, Ferreiró, Vairão and Labruge. In the 18th century, Jerónimo Contador de Argote, citing references to the castro culture, identified the existence of one of these structures in the hilltops of &quot;Cividade de Bagunte&quot;, a structure occupying . Other castros within the municipality have been mostly agricultural, and some discoveries of ceramics have occurred, although most have been found in ruins. Similar vestiges of the Roman occupation of the region continue to be discovered, and archaeological digs are ongoing in a dozen sites throughout the municipality.

The origin of the toponym is unknown. Most authors point to the 9th century counts of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, those who came from Galicia and Asturias and were ancestors of the aforementioned Flamula, as probably linked to the genesis of the name.

Later, King Dinis of Portugal bestowed on Maria Paes da Ribeira these seigneurial holdings (Dinis had long had many illegitimate children with the noblewoman).

In 1318, Afonso Sanches (the illegitimate son of King Dinis of Portugal and Aldonça Rodrigues Telha) and Teresa Martins (daughter of João Afonso de Menez, Count of Barcelos, granddaughter of Sancho IV of Castile) and great-great-granddaughter of Maria Pais da Ribeira, founded the &quot;Monastery of Santa Clara&quot;. Later referred to as the Convent of Santa Clara, the construction of the monastery developed from the bad relationship between King Dinis and his wife, Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, due to the king&#x27;s preference for his illegitimate son. The queen re-founded, in 1314, an abandoned monastery in Coimbra, which she renamed Santa Clara. This prompted King Dinis to sponsor and authorize Afonso Sanches to build a monastery of the same invocation on the right bank of the Ave river, where an ancient Celtic hillfort was located. The cornerstone was laid in 1318, and once completed it was deposited in the hands of the Franciscan Order, which he patronized throughout his life, eventually leaving Vila do Conde, its lands and rents, in their possession after his and his wife&#x27;s deaths. Today it is the of Vila do Conde. The priory became the judicial seat, with all the royal rights in the area. Yet, King Edward began to contest these grand privileges during his reign, and King John III of Portugal finally stripped them of those rights in 1537, investing his brother Edward, with the seigneurial titles. At the marriage of Catherine, his daughter, with John I, 6th Duke of Braganza, the Infante Edward passed on the title to the Royal House of Braganza. Consequently, Vila do Conde had representation in the Royal Cortes and their alcaldes were nominated for dukedoms in the Royal House of Braganza. But this was also responsible for the local government weakness and high taxes on most local economic activities, except shipping and trade, where the national government had sole control.

During the 16th century, attained the apex of its commercial and maritime importance due to naval construction, associated with the Portuguese Age of Discovery. Many of the historical buildings, such as the port and customshouse, were all integral in the commercial relief of the 16th century. The passage of King Manuel through Vila do Conde, during a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, in 1502, helped to develop some of the important infrastructures in the city: the Matrice Church, &quot;Praça Nova&quot; and municipal buildings, along with new arterials, were begun under the reign of Manuel I. The &quot;Praça Nova&quot; (), today &quot;Praça Vasco da Gama&quot; was opened in 1538, during the reign of King John III of Portugal, and where the municipal buildings were located.

Manuel I conceded a foral (royal charter) in 1516, due to the active and integral participation of its population during the exploration of the new lands in India. Of these mariners of note, were the brothers Paulo and Francisco Faria, who were on Vasco da Gama&#x27;s expeditionary voyage.

During the 19th century, French troops were responsible for the destruction and pillaging of many of the infrastructures and deaths. By the middle of the 19th century, the town had one ecclesiastical parish, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, founded by Manuel I of Portugal, and erected by the archbishop of Braga, Diogo de Sousa in 1518. In addition, the community included the &quot;Church of the Misericordia&quot;, hospital, six chapels, municipal building, customhouse, the Convent of Santa Clara (now remodelled and expanded since its construction), and the &quot;Convent of Nossa Senhora da Encarnação&quot;. In addition, the secular buildings included a small theatre, a &quot;recreational assembly&quot; and ornate dock of rock on the right margin of the Ave River towards its mouth, and across from the Chapel of &quot;Nossa Senhora da Guia&quot;.

In 1987, the urbanized area was elevated to the status of city.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
Vila do Conde is located in the north-west coast of Portugal, surrounded by the municipalities of Vila Nova de Famalicão Municipality (east), Maia (southeast), Trofa (southeast), Matosinhos (south) and Póvoa de Varzim (north). Fronting the Atlantic Ocean and the Ave River (to its south), the municipality includes of beaches, in addition to extensive rural areas with fields and estates. Located from Porto, access to the municipality is completed through many of its transport networks: the A28 (linking Porto to Viana do Castelo), the EN13, a Metro line and the A11 roadway.

The area of Vila do Conde is part of the granite-metamorphic basement, the Iberian Hercynian massif, that extends from the Spanish border to Espinho ( south of Porto). Over the Hercynian bedrock there is a prevalence of sandy beaches, and in other areas, the erosion of these sands has allowed the exposure of the rocky substrata. Most of the rock outcrops (never more than 20 metres) disappear north of the Ave River. Yet, these deposits are irregular, and most comparable sediments are not necessarily found at the same altitude. There are also deformations associated with the last inter-glacial period, that have affected these sedimentary layers, most commonly in the beach of Sampaio, where deposits have been discovered between various altitudes (5 and 9 metres).

===Human geography===
The municipality is subdivided into the following local government civil parishes, of which Azurara, Árvore and Vila do Conde form the urbanized city of Vila do Conde:
* Árvore
* Aveleda
* Azurara
* Bagunte, Ferreiró, Outeiro Maior e Parada
* Fajozes
* Fornelo e Vairão
* Gião
* Guilhabreu

* Macieira da Maia
* Malta e Canidelo
* Mindelo
* Modivas
* Retorta e Tougues
* Rio Mau e Arcos
* Touguinha e Touguinhó

====Twin towns — sister cities====

Vila do Conde is twinned with:
* Ferrol, Spain
* Le Cannet, France
* Portalegre, Portugal
* Olinda, Brazil

==Economy==
The municipal authorities have promoted a future-looking environment in Vila do Conde, that have concentrated on the tourist market, involving the requalification of many of the historical buildings (such as the Convent and customshouse), in addition to promoting an ocean-centric tourist economy associated with the &quot;Programa Polis&quot; initiative.

The communities along the coast, which include the main beaches and bird sanctuary, are essentially beach resorts with a high technology industrial park in Mindelo with some semi-conductor industries.

===Transport===
Vila do Conde is serviced by an ample network of terrestrial, aerial and maritime transport links. The road networks include accesses to the national &quot;auto-estradas&quot; (), and inter-municipal roadways, along a north–south axis from Vila Nova de Cerveira until Porto via the A28 Auto-estrada. The A7 crosses the A28 along an east-to-west intersection, along the north of the city, linking Vila Nova de Famalicão to Guimarães.

The national roadways that cross the municipal borders as managed by the municipality, including the EN13, which crosses the municipality and city along a north-to-south axis, linking into the northern agglomeration of Póvoa de Varzim. In the north, the EN205 intersects the municipality along an east to west trajectory from Vila do Conde to Vila Nova de Famalicão. Similarly, the EN104 crosses the municipality in the centre, along a similar orientation (east to west), and connects Vila do Conde with Trofa and Santo Tirso. The ancillary EN205 and EN104 are primarily used by motorists within the municipality and interlink the many civil parishes. Municipal public transport is primarily operated by &quot;Litoral Norte - Transportes Urbanos da Póvoa de Varzim&quot;, although the remains lines are managed by&quot;Transdev&quot;. The &quot;B Line&quot; of the Porto Metro system connects Vila do Conde with Porto and the airport, providing both normal and express services, in addition to northern connections to Póvoa de Varzim. The line also operated an older rail-line that connected Porto and Póvoa de Varzim, with intermediary stops in Vila do Conde, but was discontinued in 2002 in favour of Metro services.

Situated from the centre of Vila do Conde, the Porto-Francisco de Sá Carneiro International Airport (OPO), the second largest international airport in the country is linked to Vila do Conde across the A28, EN13 and Porto Metro.

===Religious===
* Chapel of Our Lady of Help (), the chapel is implanted on a rocky escarpment over the Ave River, on the &quot;Rua do Socorro&quot;; the chapel is atypical of Portuguese architecture: it has a square plan and large rounded dome. Yet, in the interior, the chapel exemplifies 18th-century architecture, with azulejos showing the &quot;life of Christ&quot;, and a Rococo-style altar. It was ordered built by Gaspar Manuel, knight of the Order of Christ and chief-pilot in service to the King during voyages to India, China and Japan, and his wife Bárbara Ferreira de Almeida; both were buried there on their deaths.
* Chapel of Our Lady of Guidance (), the chapel dates back to the 10th–11th century; located at the end of &quot;Avenida Marquês Sá da Bandeira&quot; (Vila do Conde), the chapel is referenced in a 1059 inventory of the Monastery of Guimarães, but designated as the &quot;Hermitage of Saint Julian the Martyr&quot;.

Its construction in the 16th century was initiated by King Manuel of Portugal&#x27;s visit in 1502, who defined the plan, provided a substantial budget and imposed a tax to support the project. The architecture is marked by a large portico (by João de Castilho), a rectangular bell tower (erected in 1573 (designed by João Lopes &quot;the Elder&quot;), while the interior is richly decorated, with ornate pulpits and chapels;
* Church of Mercy, and &quot;Casa do Despacho&quot; - initiated in 1559, the plan of the &quot;Assembleia da Irmandade&quot; was to construct a church with a bell tower similar to the Misericórdia Church in Porto and having a pulpit comparable to that of the Church of Santo Eloy, similarly in Porto.

* Monastery of Saint Clare (), also referred to as the Convent of Santa Clara, although founded in 1318 by Afonso Sanches and Teresa Martins, is an 18th-century refurbishment, since by the middle of the 17th century the building was in ruins and conditions did not allow the nuns to properly use the building. The remodelling of the building was discontinued after events in the 19th century and the abolition of monastic orders. Between 1936 and 1940, the &quot;DGEMN - Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais&quot; () intervened to protect the building, the of Vila do Conde.

Afonso Sanches&quot; (Vila do Conde), is a monument constructed in 1318, with traces of Gothic, Manueline, Baroque and Rococo architectural styles. The church is based in a unique nave and transept of large dimensions, with the interior marked by richly decorated woodwork. The Chapel of the Founders () houses the Manueline and Rococo tombs of historical nobility. The chorus is marked by two aisles of seating and paintings, while the high altar is embossed with gold-leaf.

<text>Daniel Calhoun Roper (April 1, 1867April 11, 1943) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the seventh United States secretary of commerce under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was the fifth United States ambassador to Canada from May 19, 1939, until August 20, 1939.

==Biography==
Daniel Calhoun Roper was born near Bennettsville, South Carolina to John Wesley Roper who was the leader of the 18th Regiment of North Carolina troops in the Confederate Army. After two years at Wofford College Roper attended Duke University (then called &quot;Trinity College&quot;) and received an A.B. in 1888, and he received his bachelor of laws degree from National University in 1901.

On December 25, 1889, Roper married Lou McKenzie. They had seven children: Margaret May, James Hunter, Daniel Calhoun Jr., Grace Henrietta, John Wesley Roper II (future Vice admiral), Harry McKenzie (future Major general) and Richard Frederick Roper.

Roper taught school for four years and then, in 1892 at the age of 25, was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives where he served for two years. He moved to Washington and worked as a clerk for the U.S. Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce. From 1900 to 1910, he worked for the Census Bureau, and then served as the clerk of the Committee on Ways and Means in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1911 to 1913.

Immediately following and through 1916, he served as first assistant postmaster general, and was chairman of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s reelection campaign in 1916. He was the chairman of the 1917 U.S. Tariff Commission and served as commissioner of Internal Revenue from 1917 to 1920. He was a member of the District of Columbia Board of Education in 1931–32.

==Secretary of Commerce==
Roper was the U.S. secretary of commerce from 1933 until 1938, during which time he played a major role in the rollout of the New Deal. The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was a part of his portfolio until it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1935.

==Later career==
In may 1939, Roper was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary (Canada). Roper&#x27;s Letter of Credence was accepted personally by George VI, King of Canada, at La Citadelle in Quebec City, on May 17, 1939. It was the King&#x27;s first official duty as King of Canada on Canadian soil. Roper resigned effective August 20, 1939; the Roosevelt administration explained that his appointment was intended to be temporary, and had been made to ensure that the U.S. would have an ambassador in Canada when the king visited. In 1941, Roper published his autobiography, &quot;Fifty Years of Public Life.&quot;

Roper died on April 11, 1943, at his home in Washington, D.C., at the age of 76 from leukemia. Roper was interred at the Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. In 1966, the District of Columbia Public School system named a middle school in Deanwood for him, but in 1997 they renamed it for Ronald Brown, who was also a Commerce Secretary. That school was closed in 2013 but reopened as Ron Brown College Preparatory High School in 2016.

<text>Salvator Rosa (1615 – March 15, 1673) is best known today as an Italian Baroque painter, whose romanticized landscapes and history paintings, often set in dark and untamed nature, exerted considerable influence from the 17th century into the early 19th century. In his lifetime he was among the most famous painters, known for his flamboyant personality, and regarded as an accomplished poet, satirist, actor, musician, and printmaker, as well. He was active in Naples, Rome, and Florence, where on occasion he was compelled to move between cities, as his caustic satire earned him enemies in the artistic and intellectual circles of the day. 

As a history painter, he often selected obscure and esoteric subjects from the Bible, mythology, and the lives of philosophers, that were seldom addressed by other artists. He rarely painted the common religious subjects, unless they allowed a treatment dominated by the landscape element. He also produced battle scenes, allegories, scenes of witchcraft, and many self portraits. However, he is most highly regarded for his very original landscapes, depicting &quot;sublime&quot; nature: often wild and hostile, at times rendering the people that populated them as marginal in the greater realm of nature. They were prototypes of the romantic landscape and the very antithesis of the &quot;picturesque&quot; classical views of Claude Lorrain. Some critics have noted that his technical skills and craftsmanship as a painter were not always equal to his truly innovative and original visions. This is in part due to a large number of canvases he hastily produced in his youth (1630s) in pursuit of financial gain, paintings that Rosa himself came to loathe and distance himself from in his later years, as well as posthumously misattributed paintings. Many of his peopled landscapes ended up abroad by the 18th century, and he was better known in England and France than most Italian Baroque painters.

Rosa has been described as &quot;unorthodox and extravagant&quot;, a &quot;perpetual rebel&quot;, &quot;The Anti-Claude&quot;, and a proto-Romantic. He had a great influence on Romanticism, becoming a cult-like figure in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and myths and legends grew around his life, to the point that his real life was scarcely distinguished from the bandits and outsiders that roamed the wild and thundery landscapes he painted. By the mid 19th century however, with the rise of realism and Impressionism, his work fell from favor and received very little attention. A renewed interest in his paintings emerged in the late 20th century, and although he is not ranked among the very greatest of the Baroque painters by art historians today, he is considered an innovative and significant landscape painter and a progenitor of the romantic movement.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Rosa was born in Arenella, at that time in the outskirts of Naples, on either June 20 or July 21, 1615. His mother was Giulia Greca Rosa, a member of one of the Greek families of Sicily. His father, Vito Antonio de Rosa, a land surveyor, urged his son to become a lawyer or a priest, and entered him into the convent of the Somaschi Fathers. Yet Salvator showed a preference for the arts and secretly worked with his maternal uncle Paolo Greco to learn about painting. He soon transferred himself to the tutelage of his brother-in-law Francesco Fracanzano, a pupil of Ribera, and afterward to either Aniello Falcone, a contemporary of Domenico Gargiulo, or to Ribera. Some sources claim he spent time living with roving bandits. At the age of seventeen, his father died; his mother was destitute with at least five children and Salvator found himself without financial support and the head of a household looking to him for support.

He continued apprenticeship with Falcone, helping him complete his battlepiece canvases. In that studio, it is said that Giovanni Lanfranco took notice of his work, and advised him to relocate to Rome, where he stayed from 1634 until 1636.

Returning to Naples, he began painting haunting landscapes, overgrown with vegetation, or jagged beaches, mountains, and caves. Rosa was among the first to paint &quot;romantic&quot; landscapes, with a special turn for scenes of picturesque, often turbulent and rugged scenes peopled with shepherds, brigands, seamen, soldiers. These early landscapes were sold cheaply through private dealers.

He returned to Rome in 1638–39, where he was housed by Cardinal Francesco Maria Brancaccio, bishop of Viterbo. For the Chiesa Santa Maria della Morte in Viterbo, Rosa painted the first of his few altarpieces, the &quot;Incredulity of Thomas&quot;.

===Wife and family===

In 1640, Rosa met Lucrezia Paolini (–1696) in Florence. Lucrezia was a married woman, whose husband had left the city and abandoned her soon after their marriage, never to return. She served as a model for Rosa on occasion, and was likely the model for the allegory of &quot;Music&quot; (). Rosa and Lucrezia soon became dedicated and lifelong companions. Their first son Rosalvo was born in August 1641, probably in Volterra, and another son, Augusto, was born in 1657. Records show at least four more children were born and placed with foundling hospitals between 1641 and 1657, giving some indication of their poor financial condition in those years. The custom of unmarried couples living together was not uncommon in the early years of the 17th century, but as the decades passed the church grew less and less tolerant of the practice. At times Rosa&#x27;s prominent reputation and relationships to powerful patrons helped to shield him from the Inquisition. At other times, the situation left him vulnerable to the many rivals and enemies he made through his satires and ostentatious character. In 1656, feeling pressure in Rome from the poet Agostino Favoriti and his close ally Fabio Chigi, recently elected Pope Alexander VII, Rosa sent Lucrezia and their son Rosalvo to stay in Naples with his family. Soon after she arrived, a severe outbreak of the plague hit Naples, and Rosalvo, Salvator&#x27;s brother, sister, brother-in-law and their children all died in the epidemic. Lucrezia survived however and returned to Rome alone. The following year their son Augusto was born. Near the end of his life, declining in health and anticipating death, Rosa married Lucrezia on March 4, 1673. On March 17 he died. An inventory of Rosa&#x27;s house taken in 1673 shortly after his death, indicated the &quot;Portrait of Lucrezia Paolini&quot; was hanging in a prominent location in the home, and one of the few paintings in his possession when he died.

=== Career ===

While Rosa had a facile genius at painting, he pursued a wide variety of arts: music, poetry, writing, etching, and acting. In Rome, he befriended Pietro Testa and Claude Lorrain. During a Roman carnival play he wrote and acted in a masque, in which his character bustled about Rome distributing satirical prescriptions for diseases of the body and more particularly, of the mind. In costume, he inveighed against the farcical comedies acted in the Trastevere under the direction of Bernini.

While his plays were successful, this activity also gained him powerful enemies among patrons and artists, including Bernini himself, in Rome. Around 1640, he accepted an invitation from Giovanni Carlo de&#x27; Medici to relocate to Florence, where he stayed until 1649. Once there, Rosa sponsored a combination of studio and salon of poets, playwrights, and painters—the so-called &quot;Accademia dei Percossi&quot; (Academy of the Stricken). To the rigid art milieu of Florence, he introduced his canvases of wild landscapes; while influential, he gathered few true pupils. Another painter poet, Lorenzo Lippi, shared with Rosa the hospitality of the cardinal and the same circle of friends. Lippi encouraged him to proceed with the poem &quot;Il Malmantile racquistato&quot;. He was well acquainted also with Ugo and Giulio Maffei, and was housed with them in Volterra, where he wrote four satires &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;Painting&quot;, and &quot;War&quot;. About the same time he painted &quot;Philosophy&quot;, now in the National Gallery, London.

A passage in one of his satires suggests that he sympathized with the 1647 insurrection led by Masaniello—whose portrait he painted, though probably not from life. Rosa&#x27;s tempestuous art and reputation as a rebel gave rise to a popular legend—recounted in a biography of Rosa published in 1824 by Sydney, Lady Morgan—that Rosa lived with a gang of bandits and participated in the uprising in Naples against Spanish rule. Although these activities cannot be conveniently dovetailed into known dates of his career, in 1846 a famous romantic ballet about this story titled &quot;Catarina&quot; was produced in London by the choreographer Jules Perrot and composer Cesare Pugni.

He returned to stay in Rome in 1649. Here he increasingly focused on large-scale paintings, tackling themes and stories unusual for seventeenth-century painters. These included &quot;Democritus amid the Tombs&quot;, &quot;The Death of Socrates&quot;, &quot;The Death of Regulus&quot; (these two are now in England), &quot;Justice Quitting the Earth&quot; and the &quot;Allegory of Fortune&quot;. This last work raised a storm of controversy among religious and civil authorities who perceived in it a satire directed at them. Rosa, endeavouring at conciliation, published a text in which he provided anodyne explanations for the painting&#x27;s imagery; nonetheless he was nearly arrested. It was about this time that Rosa wrote his satire named &quot;Babylon&quot;.


His criticisms of Roman art culture won him several enemies. An allegation arose that his published satires were not his own, but Rosa vehemently denied the charges. It may be possible that literary friends in Florence and Volterra coached him about the topic of his satires, while the compositions of which remained nonetheless his own. To confute his detractors he wrote the last of the series, entitled &quot;Envy&quot;.

Among the pictures of his last years were the &quot;Saul and the Witch of Endor&quot; and &quot;Battlepiece&quot; now in the Musée du Louvre, the latter painted in 40 days, full of longdrawn carnage, with ships burning in the offing; &quot;Polycrates and the Fishermen&quot;; and the &quot;Oath of Catiline&quot; (Palazzo Pitti).

While occupied with a series of satirical portraits, to be closed by one of himself, Rosa was assailed by dropsy. He died a half year later. His tomb is in Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, where a portrait of him has been set up. Salvator Rosa, after struggles of his early youth, had successfully earned a handsome fortune.

He was a significant etcher, with a highly popular and influential series of small prints of soldiers, and a number of larger and very ambitious subjects.

Among his pupils were Evangelista Martinotti of Monferrato and his brother Francesco.
Another pupil was Ascanio della Penna of Perugia.

==Legacy==
During Rosa&#x27;s lifetime his work inspired followers such as Giovanni Ghisolfi, but his most lasting influence was on the later development of romantic and sublime landscape traditions within painting. Eighteenth-century artists influenced by Rosa include Alessandro Magnasco, Andrea Locatelli, Giovanni Paolo Panini and Marco Ricci. As Wittkower states, it is in his landscapes, not his grand historical or religious dramas, that Rosa truly expresses his innovative abilities most graphically. Rosa himself dismissed his early landscapes as frivolous &quot;capricci&quot; in comparison to his history paintings and later work, but the academically conventional history canvases often restrained his rebellious streak. 
He generally avoided the idyllic and pastoral calm country-sides of Claude Lorrain and Paul Bril in his landscapes, and created brooding, melancholic fantasies, awash in ruins and brigands. By the eighteenth century, the contrasts between Rosa and the &quot;sublime&quot; landscape, and artists such as Claude and the &quot;picturesque&quot; landscape, were much remarked upon. A 1748 poem by James Thompson, &quot;The Castle of Indolence&quot;, illustrated this: &quot;Whate&#x27;er Lorraine light touched with softening hue/ Or savage Rosa dashed, or learned Poussin drew&quot;.

In a time when artists were often highly constrained by patrons, Rosa had a plucky streak of independence, which celebrated the special role of the artist. &quot;Our wealth must consist in things of the spirit, and in contenting ourselves with sipping, while others gorge themselves in prosperity&quot;. He refused to paint on commission or to agree on a price beforehand, and he chose his own subjects. In his own words, he painted &quot;...purely for my own satisfaction. I need to be transported by enthusiasm and I can only employ my brushes when I am in ecstasy.&quot;

===Salvator Rosa and romanticism===

Rosa&#x27;s influence on romanticism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was profound. Art historians have described him as a &quot;cult figure&quot;, who &quot;inaugurated the romantic landscape&quot;, an initiator of the &quot;cult&quot; of the sublime landscape. One of the earliest manifestations of the romantic movement to emerge in the early 18th century was the English landscape garden, and the paintings of Rosa, as well as Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin were key inspirations and models. William Kent, who originated the naturalized garden was known to be a great admirer of Rosa and went so far as to plant dead trees in his gardens to achieve Salvator Rosa effects.

One historian noted &quot;An extraordinary amount of Rosa&#x27;s fame and influence in England seems to have rested on verbal and literary transmission, and had an impact that extended far beyond the borderline of purely pictorial concerns.&quot; In &quot;A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful&quot; (1757), Edmund Burke designated Salvator Rosa as the &quot;painter of the Sublime&quot;. Horace Walpole, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote highly of his paintings. &quot;His name came to be a kind of code word for the qualities most appreciated by the romantics...savage sublimity, terror, grandeur, astonishment, and pleasing horror&quot; A number of accounts of Rosa&#x27;s life were published purporting to be biographies, often including fictionalized anecdotes. Salvator Rosa was the subject of an opera by Antônio Carlos Gomes, a ballet &quot;Catarina or La Fille du Bandit&quot;, and Franz Liszt included an arrangement of a song by Giovanni Bononcini, in his suite Annees de pelerinage, &quot;Deuxieme annee: Italie&quot;, (S.161) No. 3, &quot;Canzonetta del Salvator Rosa&quot;.

Rosa and his tempestuous spirit became the darling of British Romantics such as Henry Fuseli, John Hamilton Mortimer, and Alexander Runciman. His influence can be seen in the work of artist such as John Martin, who studied Rosa&#x27;s work in his formative years, A recent exhibit of William Turner&#x27;s work, at the Prado museum in Madrid, notes the influence Rosa had on Turner&#x27;s landscapes. Rosa&#x27;s influence can also be seen in American art of the period. Thomas Cole counted Rosa among his heroes, and his impact has been identified in the work of artists such as Washington Allston, George Caleb Bingham, Thomas Moran, William Sidney Mount, John Trumbull, Benjamin West and other American artist.

Rosa&#x27;s reputation and influence waned in the nineteenth century; when his &quot;Monks Fishing&quot; was displayed in Dulwich in 1843 it was criticized by John Ruskin as telling &quot;unmitigated falsehoods&quot; and containing &quot;laws of nature set at open defiance&quot;. Since the 1970s, Rosa&#x27;s work has received renewed attention from scholars. including museum exhibitions, a catalog raisonné, catalogs of his drawings, the publication of his letters, biographical works, and other volumes ranging from paperback picture books to scholarly monographs.

===Satires===

Cesareo (1892) and Cartelli (1899) wrote books taking account of Rosa&#x27;s satires. The satires, though considerably spread abroad during his lifetime, were not published until 1719. They are all in terza rima, written without much literary correctness, but spirited. Rosa here appears as a very severe castigator of all ranks and conditions of men, not sparing the highest, and as a champion of the poor and down-trodden, and of moral virtue and Catholic faith.


The satire on &quot;Music&quot; exposes the insolence and profligacy of musicians, and the shame of courts and churches in encouraging them. &quot;Poetry&quot; dwells on the pedantry, imitativeness, adulation, affectation and indecency of poets—also their poverty, and the neglect with which they were treated; and there is a very vigorous sortie against oppressive governors and aristocrats. Tasso&#x27;s glory is upheld; Dante is spoken of as obsolete, and Ariosto as corrupting.

&quot;Painting&quot; inveighs against the pictorial treatment of squalid subjects, such as beggars, against the ignorance and lewdness of painters, and their tricks of trade, and the gross indecorum of painting sprawling half-naked saints of both sexes. &quot;War&quot; (which contains a eulogy of Masaniello) derides the folly of mercenary soldiers, who fight and perish while kings stay at home; the vile morals of kings and lords, their heresy and unbelief.

In &quot;Babylon&quot;, Rosa represents himself as a fisherman, Tirreno, constantly unlucky in his net-hauls on the Euphrates; he converses with a native of the country, Ergasto. Babylon (Rome) is very severely treated, and Naples much the same.

&quot;Envy&quot; (the last of the satires, and generally accounted the best) represents Rosa dreaming that, as he is about to inscribe in all modesty his name upon the threshold of the temple of glory, the goddess or fiend of Envy obstructs him, and a long interchange of reciprocal objurgations ensues. Here occurs the highly charged portrait of the chief Roman detractor of Salvator (we are not aware that he has ever been identified by name); and the painter protests that he would never condescend to do any of the lascivious work in painting so shamefully in vogue.

Though critical of contemporary art and poetry, Rosa is part of his age in his frequent weighty classical allusions, his lexical freedom, and his liking for ornate rhetorical structures. His poetry also shows a directness and accuracy of expression that drives home the satiric point, often laconically.

*The 1846 ballet &quot;Catarina&quot; by the choreographer Jules Perrot and the composer Cesare Pugni was produced in London at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, and was inspired by the alleged story of Rosa&#x27;s dealings with Brigands of the Abruzzi.
*One of the pieces included in the piano collection &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot; by Franz Liszt is entitled &quot;Canzonetta del Salvator Rosa&quot;. That song (&quot;Vado ben spesso cangiando loco&quot;) was, however, composed by Giovanni Bononcini.

<doc id="746892" wikidata="Q1707912" url="?curid=746892" title="Joseph Rosati">
<text>Joseph Rosati, CM (30 January 1789 – 25 September 1843) was an Italian-born Catholic missionary to the United States who served as the first Bishop of Saint Louis from 1826 to 1843. A member of the Congregation of the Mission, in 1820 he was appointed provincial superior over all the Vincentians in the United States.

==Early life==
Rosati was born in the town of Sora, then in the region of Campania, part of the Kingdom of Naples. He completed his education in 1807 and entered the Congregation of the Mission, commonly called the Vincentian Fathers, in 1808. He was ordained a priest in 1811. Rosati had taken up the study of Hebrew. Felix de Andreis, his friend and preceptor, advised Rosati to put aside Hebrew and take up English as he would need it in someday preaching in an English-speaking country.

The Apostolic Administrator of Louisiana and the Two Floridas, Louis Dubourg, had gone to Rome for his consecration as a bishop. While in Italy, DuBourg stayed at Monte Citorio, the mother church of the Congregation of the Mission order in Rome, and seeking personnel to help carry out his mission on the American frontier, he eventually convinced the Vincentians to send a contingent to Missouri to construct a seminary. During his time in Europe, he traveled about. One recruit he made was de Andreis, who, in turn, recruited his friend Rosati to accompany him to the New World.

==Missionary in America==
On 12 June 1816 the two Vicentians sailed from Bordeaux on the American brig &quot;Ranger&quot;, Dubourg having paid their passage. Rosati was ill for the entire forty-three days it took to sail to Baltimore, Maryland. There they found hospitality with the Sulpicians, with whom they stayed about a month. They then traveled by flatboat from Pittsburgh to Louisville, Kentucky, where bishop, Benedict Joseph Flaget invited them to Bardstown, Kentucky. The two Italians taught theology at St. Thomas Seminary there, while they perfected their knowledge of the English language and adapted to life on the new continent. During his stay at Bardstown, Rosati made a mission excursion to Vincennes.

Dubourg himself returned to the United States on 4 September 1817, accompanied by a large group of priests and religious, also landing in Baltimore. From there he sent a request to Flaget that he accompany the two Vincentian priests to St. Louis to prepare the groups&#x27; arrival.

Flaget agreed to Dubourg&#x27;s request, and he and the two priests set out on horseback for St. Louis, a distance of over three hundred miles. En route, they were joined by Donatien Olivier at Kaskaskia, where they crossed the Mississippi River to reach the former French colony of Ste. Genevieve. There they were welcomed by Henry Pratte, a native of the town and the first native-born Catholic priest of Missouri. Leaving De Andreis to help in the parish there, the group continued on to St. Louis, where they were shocked to find the church and rectory, built 40 years earlier, to be falling apart, totally unfurnished and not even having doors or windows. The priests had to sleep on the ground, as there was no floor, wrapped in buffalo robes.

Pratte was able to tidy up and fix the rectory to a minimal standard of occupancy, just in time for the arrival of Dubourg and his entourage on 15 January 1815. Wearing their full pontifical vestments, he and Flaget processed through the town, greeted by the majority of the 2,500 occupants of the town, and proceeded to the church, where he addressed his flock for the first time.

==St. Mary&#x27;s of the Barrens==
The Catholic population of Perryville, Missouri was in need of a permanent resident priest, and had offered 640 acres of land to Dubourg in exchange for the regular services of a priest and a school for the children. Rosati moved to Perryville, where he opened St. Mary of the Barrens Seminary in 1818, to educate the young men of the region and to train new members for the Vincentian Society. For several years, he planned and supervised the construction of the school, while at the same time teaching most of the classes and functioning as the local pastor. In 1820, he was appointed the Vincentian Provincial Superior in the United States.

==Episcopacy==
In 1822, Rosati was appointed vicar apostolic of Mississippi and Alabama, and, the following year, appointed coadjutor bishop to Dubourg, whose territory extended from Louisiana to Florida. He was based in St. Louis, while Dubourg lived in New Orleans.

This arrangement lasted until 1826, when, in the course of a trip to Rome, Dubourg unexpectedly submitted his resignation to the Holy See. Rosati wrote, &quot;I was absolutely bewildered and could not persuade myself it was true.&quot; At that point, the Vatican decided to divide the diocese, establishing St. Louis as a separate episcopal see. On 18 July of that year, Rosati was appointed as the Apostolic Administrator of both dioceses. He was named as the first bishop of St. Louis on 20 March 1827.

Rosati&#x27;s achievements include the opening of Mullanphy Hospital (later DePaul Hospital) by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul in 1828, the founding of St. Mary&#x27;s of the Barrens College and Seminary, the establishment of what would become Saint Louis University in 1829 and the construction of the first Cathedral of St. Louis from 1831 through 1834.

He took part in the first four Provincial Councils of Baltimore. In 1841, Rosati was appointed by Pope Gregory XVI to assist in negotiations between the Holy See and Haiti. Before leaving for Haiti, he consecrated Peter Richard Kenrick as his coadjutor. After submitting a report on his diplomatic mission to the pope, he died in Rome in 1843, His remains were returned to St. Louis, and interred in his cathedral.

==Slavery==
Per studies by the St. Louis Archdiocese, Rosati owned slaves. In a financial ledger from 1830–1839, Rosati recorded the sale of &quot;my negro boy called Peter about nine or ten years old&quot; to the Vincentian priest John Bouiller for the sum of $150. 

==Legacy==
&quot;Bishop Rosati was eminent for his holy life, his zeal as a priest, his successful administration as a bishop, his learning, his eloquence. He built up the diocese from a very slender beginning, organized the Indian missions, and extended the work of the Church beyond the Rocky Mountains.&quot;

Rosati is the namesake for an all-girls Catholic high school, Rosati-Kain, located in the Central West End in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, located next to the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis.

<doc id="746893" wikidata="Q140814" url="?curid=746893" title="156 Xanthippe">
<text>156 Xanthippe is a dark background asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 22 November 1875, by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Austrian Naval Observatory, in what is now Croatia. It is named after Xanthippe, the wife of the Greek philosopher Socrates.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Xanthippe&quot; is a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.1–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,645 days; semi-major axis of 2.73 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.23 and an inclination of 10° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Physical characteristics ==

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile during 1981 gave a light curve with a period of 22.5 hours. Based upon its spectrum this is classified as a hydrated C-type asteroid (Ch-subtype) in the SMASS classification, indicating that it likely has a carbonaceous composition.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Xanthippe&quot; measures between 110.409 and 143.35 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.030 and 0.0687.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named for Xanthippe, the wife of the Greek philosopher Socrates (c. 470–399 BC), after whom asteroid 5450 Sokrates was named. The official naming citation was mentioned in &quot;The Names of the Minor Planets&quot; by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

<text>Andreja Gomboc (born 10 November 1969), is a Slovenian astrophysicist.

== Biography ==
Andreja Gomboc was born in Murska Sobota, Slovenia.

Andreja Gomboc graduated in 1995 at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics (FMF) at University of Ljubljana with diploma work &quot;The appearance of a star falling in a black hole&quot; (&quot;Kako je videti padec zvezde v črno luknjo.&quot;).

From 1995 to 2001, she was a postgraduate student of physics at FMF and also a teaching assistant. She obtained Ph.D. by defending the dissertation &quot;Rapid luminosity changes due to interaction with a black hole&quot; (&quot;&quot;), which she prepared under the supervision of Andrej Čadež. In the dissertation she treated tidal disruption of stars during a close encounter with a massive black hole in a galactic nucleus. After obtaining her PhD, she became a member of the Department of Physics at FMF, where she was an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics and lectured subjects: Astrophysics, Astronomy 2, Theoretical Astrophysics, Astrophysics of stars and the Galaxy, Selected topics in astrophysics and particle physics. In years 2008–2014 she gave lectures in Astronomy at the Faculty of Education in Ljubljana (PeF). Since autumn 2015, she is full professor of astronomy at the University of Nova Gorica.

For her Ph.D. dissertation she received the Pomurje research award in 2002.

From 2002 to 2004, she was a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow at the Astrophysics Research Institute (ARI) of Liverpool John Moores University, England. There she became involved in research project for observing optical afterglows of gamma ray bursts with three largest robotic telescopes: Liverpool Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory at La Palma, Faulkes Telescope North at Hawaii and Faulkes Telescope South in Australia. GRB group at ARI, Liverpool John Moores University, among which members is also Andreja Gomboc, received The Times Higher Award for research project of the year 2007 &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;. The judging panel awarded excellent team work and results of measurement of optical afterglow polarisation, published in &quot;Science&quot;. Among other publications, she is also a co-author of two papers in &quot;Science&quot; and three papers in &quot;Nature&quot;.

In January 2010, she delivered a talk entitled &quot;Us and the Universe&quot; (&quot;Vesolje in mi&quot;) in National Assembly of Republic of Slovenia as part of the project &quot;Harvesting Knowledge&quot;.

She is a member of the Gaia, which was launched by ESA in 2013. Gaia mission is measuring distances and radial velocities of about a billion of stars in our Galaxy.

From 2011 to 2014, she was the PI of the ESA project &quot;Relativistic Global Navigation System&quot;.

Her research fields are astronomy and astrophysics, the general theory of relativity, black holes, gamma ray bursts, stellar rotation, and rotational velocities of symbiotic stars.

She publishes popular science articles on astronomy and astrophysics in Slovenian astronomical magazine &quot;Spika&quot;. She is the founder and editor of the web portal Portal v vesolje.

In the International Year of Astronomy 2009 (IYA) she was the Single Point of Contact and Coordinator for Slovenia.

<text>Homeworld 2 is a real-time strategy video game sequel to &quot;Homeworld&quot;, developed by Relic Entertainment and released in 2003 by now defunct publisher Sierra Entertainment. Its story concerns Hiigara&#x27;s response to a new enemy called the Vaygr. Its gameplay takes a new direction with the enhancement of its graphics and audio. In contrast to the closely equivalent Kushan and Taiidan forces of the original game, Vaygr and Hiigaran spaceships differ significantly in design and application.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Homeworld 2&quot; shares the movement system and three-dimensional play area of its predecessor. Units are moved three-dimensionally using a combination of mouse movements and key presses to modify the z-axis of the destination position.

Gameplay in &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; depends on so-called &quot;Resource Units&quot; (RUs), which are collected by harvester craft. RUs are the currency for both ship creation and technology research, placing limits on what combination of shipbuilding and new technology research can be carried out in a single game.

The player&#x27;s fleet is centered on the Mothership, the destruction of which results in an immediate Game Over in a single-player game, and is a critical loss in a multiplayer game. The Mothership is capable of constructing all but the very largest ships, which must be built using Shipyards (the game states these are built at orbital facilities and arrive via hyperspace). The Mothership can also build Carriers, which themselves can build any ship from the Fighter, Corvette and Frigate families. Although the Mothership is initially the center of new research, Carriers and Shipyards can build their own on-board Research Labs.

All units in &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; are starships of various classes, from small to large: Fighter, Corvette, Frigate and Capital Ship. Although the larger ships are more powerful and durable, they are also much slower and less maneuverable. Ships within each class specialize in certain areas and are vulnerable to certain other ships, although there may be ships in the same class that do not share the same vulnerability. Ion Cannon Frigates, for instance, are very vulnerable to fighters due to the unwieldy (albeit powerful) nature of their single weapon. Flak Frigates, however, are specifically intended for use against fighters, but lack the firepower to defend themselves against other frigates. Effective use of the relative strengths of each ship is essential for success.

&quot;Homeworld 2&quot; allows players to co-opt enemy ships using specialized frigates, much like the original game. These maneuver close to enemy vessels and dispatch boarding parties, which capture the vessel after a short period of time; capture can be sped up by using multiple Frigates against the same target simultaneously. However, these frigates are completely exposed to attack during the boarding process, and all capturing progress is lost if they are destroyed.

Although &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; nominally has no difficulty setting, it features dynamic difficulty adjustments, in which the strength of a level&#x27;s opposition is determined using the composition of the fleet the player enters the level with (the fleet remaining at the end of the previous level). This led to an exploit in which players &quot;retired&quot; all of their ships at the end of the previous level, reducing them to RUs, and entering the next level with a huge store of raw materials to use against a very weak enemy. The game also codifies the support caps introduced in &quot;Homeworld&quot;, and explained in &quot;&quot;, by placing overall limits on how many ships of each class the player may control at once.

Mission objectives in the single-player game are primarily achieved by destroying key enemy elements, capturing particular targets, protecting certain units for a particular amount of time, or towing an object back to the Mothership. In addition to the storyline objectives, a significant portion of the missions require the destruction of all enemy units.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Homeworld 2&quot; can be played online with 5 other players.

==Plot==
&quot;Homeworld 2&quot; continues the struggle of the Hiigarans and their leader Karan S&#x27;jet. While in the original game the player could select either the Kushan or Taiidan races, in the sequel the Kushan are established as the canonical protagonists.

During the events of the original game (and played out in the prequel &quot;&quot;), the Kushan race of the planet Kharak discovered the wreckage of the &quot;Khar-Toba&quot;, an interstellar transport starship, in the Great Desert. Inside, they found an ancient Hyperspace Core, and a galactic map etched on a piece of stone that showed that the Kushan had been transplanted to Kharak long ago, and pointed the way to their long-lost homeworld, Hiigara. The Kushan built an enormous self-sufficient Mothership, powered by the Hyperspace Core from the &quot;Khar-Toba&quot;, to carry 600,000 people across the galaxy to Hiigara. Throughout their journey, the Kushan battled the forces of the Taiidan Empire, which had exiled them, and endured numerous other hardships along the way. With the aid of the Bentusi, a powerful and enigmatic race of traders, the Kushan reached Hiigara and destroyed the Taiidan Emperor, laying claim to their homeworld.

The story continues that the Hyperspace Core found in the &quot;Khar-Toba&quot; was the second of only three known to exist in the galaxy, left behind by an ancient race known as the Progenitors. The First Core was possessed by the Bentusi; the third was lost until approximately one hundred years after the Exiles reclaimed Hiigara, found by a Vaygr Warlord named Makaan. With his massive Flagship empowered by the Third Core, Makaan began a campaign of conquest, seizing control of the remnants of the Taiidan Empire and surrounding star systems, and—as of the beginning of &quot;Homeworld 2&quot;—began attempts to capture Hiigara. The story states that religious beings of the galaxy consider the discovery of the Third Core to announce the End Times, during which Sajuuk, thought to be an immensely powerful being, will return. Makaan believes himself to be the &quot;Sajuuk-Khar&quot;, a messianic figure that will unite the Three Cores and herald the return of Sajuuk.

The game begins with the commissioning of a new Mothership, the &quot;Pride of Hiigara&quot;, at the Great Derelict at Tanis. The &quot;Pride of Hiigara&quot; is similar in shape and design to the original Mothership and commanded by Karan S&#x27;jet, as in the original game. The ship is attacked by the Vaygr during the final stages of construction, but escapes to rally the Hiigaran fleet. Makaan&#x27;s fleet lays siege to Hiigara, and the Warlord offers a deal to the Hiigarans: if they surrender the Second Core to him, he will spare their Homeworld.

The Bentusi inform the Hiigarans that they must find Balcora Gate, left behind by the Progenitors, behind which is something essential for stopping either the Vaygr threat, the End Times, or both. The Hiigarans find a Progenitor Dreadnought in the wreckage of the old engineering section of the Old Progenitor Mothership, and find that it is required to unlock Balcora Gate. The Hiiigarans briefly engage with a Progenitor Keeper, an ancient AI controlled vessel impervious to almost all damage. The Great Harbor Ship of Bentus, last of the Bentusi, sacrifices itself after being ambushed by 4 Progenitor Keepers, leaving its Core for the Hiigarans to claim in order to stop Makaan. But the Warlord learns of the Balcora Gate as well, and the game&#x27;s penultimate mission takes place on the other side, where Hiigarans and Vaygr alike discover that Sajuuk is in fact a Mothership-sized Progenitor starship, with sockets for the Three Hyperspace Cores.

The Hiigaran fleet engages Makaan&#x27;s Flagship and destroys it, claiming the Third Core from the wreckage. With all three Cores, the Hiigarans reactivate Sajuuk, abandoning the &quot;Pride of Hiigara&quot;, and bring it back to Hiigara to break the Vaygr siege, destroying the Vaygr&#x27;s planet-killer weapons and saving Hiigara from destruction. Sajuuk is later found to be the key to a galaxy-wide network of hyperspace gates, ushering in a new age of trade and prosperity for all civilized races in the galaxy - the Age of Karan S&#x27;jet, the true &quot;Sajuuk-Khar&quot;.

===Characters===
Like the original &quot;Homeworld&quot;, there are only a handful of individual characters with a prominent place in the narrative:
* Karan S&#x27;jet: The main protagonist, the scientist who volunteered to become the living core of the Mothership during the original game, returns once again as Fleet Command on the &quot;Pride of Hiigara&quot; to lead the Hiigaran fleet against the Vaygr. She is voiced by Jennifer Dawne Graveness, taking over for Heidi Ernest (the original voice of Fleet Command in the first game and in the training missions for &quot;Cataclysm&quot;). It was announced at PAX South in 2015 that the voice change was due to personal circumstances that left Ernest unable to reprise her role as Fleet Command, though she returned to the role for the Remastered Collection.
* Fleet Intelligence: Much like in the original game, Fleet Intelligence is a male character who analyzes sensor data and generates mission objectives during the single-player campaign; also like in the original game, he is not heard in multiplayer. He is voiced by Eli Gabay in the original release. Michael Sunczyk, the voice of Fleet Intelligence in the first game, returned to the role for the Remastered Edition in 2015.
* Captain Soban: Commander of the Ferin Sha fleet that aids in the defense of the &quot;Pride of Hiigara&quot; during a Vaygr attack.
* Captain Elohim: Commander of a Kiith Nabaal shipyard that eventually joins the Mothership fleet.
* Makaan: The main antagonist, Makaan is a warlord of the Vaygr and ruler of an interstellar domain that includes the remnants of the Taiidan Empire. He believes himself to be the &quot;Sajuuk-khar&quot;, the Chosen One who will unite the Three Cores and bring about the return of Sajuuk. Unlike the Taiidan Emperor in the original &quot;Homeworld&quot;, Makaan is a battle-hardened warlord and brilliant strategist. He is voiced by Mark Oliver.

==Development==
&quot;Homeworld 2&quot; uses a proprietary scripting language, known as SCAR (SCripting At Relic) in addition to others. The SCAR language was created for the express purpose of coding in &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; and deals mainly with events in the single-player campaign (zooming out with the camera, creating enemy ships, moving the player to the next level, etc.). &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; also makes use of version 4.0 of the Lua programming language. &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; uses Lua for in-game levels, formatted as .level files, AI, and as a Rules Engine for game logic. The developer sets many variables inside a &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; game, including ambient light, background, placement of start positions and asteroids, among many other things.

The soundtrack of &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; was created by Paul Ruskay, like the former parts of the series.

==Reception==
&quot;Homeworld 2&quot; received a score of 85% at GameRankings, and 83/100 at Metacritic. It also received a 9 out of 10 from &quot;IGN&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best computer game of September 2003.

The scenery background graphics were particularly well-received.

During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; for &quot;Computer Strategy Game of the Year&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Intellectual property history===
Approximately a year after the release of &quot;Homeworld 2&quot;, in August 2004, Relic Studios was purchased by THQ for approximately US$10 million. As THQ was considered to be a competitor of Sierra Entertainment and Vivendi Universal, the prospect of a &quot;Homeworld&quot; sequel remained unlikely as Sierra was still the owner of the &quot;Homeworld&quot; Intellectual Property (IP) until September 2007 when it was announced that THQ was in talks with Vivendi to purchase the license &quot;Homeworld&quot; franchise. In November 2007, THQ finally confirmed that it had acquired the license for the &quot;Homeworld&quot; franchise but didn&#x27;t confirm a sequel maintaining that it had no comments on future games from THQ based on &quot;Homeworld&quot;. However, Eurogamer reported in November 2008 that Relic was &quot;definitely looking&quot; at creating &quot;Homeworld 3&quot;. &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II&quot; lead designer Jonny Ebbert commented that &quot;We&#x27;re really happy the IP has made its way home, and yeah, we&#x27;re definitely looking at it. We&#x27;ll see what happens in the future,&quot;. Ebbert also commented that there was always a chance that the sequel could be in development behind closed doors. The strongest evidence indicating that &quot;Homeworld 3&quot; is in development came from Relic&#x27;s General Manager, Tarnie Williams indicating that &quot;three or four&quot; titles were in development while declining to elaborate further. In 2011 Relic confirmed that they would &quot;like to develop Homeworld 3&quot; but they did not confirm or deny working on it. In early 2013 THQ suffered financial difficulties and liquidated their assets due to bankruptcy; Relic was sold off to SEGA. The &quot;Homeworld&quot; IP was not part of this sale. Despite early speculation that SEGA would attempt to rescue the IP, ultimately the &quot;Homeworld&quot; IP was sold to Gearbox Software. Gearbox announced that their initial plans would be to bring the existing &quot;Homeworld&quot; games to multiple digital sales platforms, but also created a forum on their website specifically asking for fan ideas about how the series should proceed. Blackbird Interactive, a newer developer made up of many of the designers of the original &quot;Homeworld&quot;, later offered their support of Gearbox&#x27;s purchase of the IP.

===Prequel===
In 2013, Blackbird Interactive announced the creation of a game titled &quot;Shipbreakers&quot;. Originally, the game developers focused on a game that carried the &quot;essence&quot; of &quot;Homeworld&quot;, but not directly related. However, Gearbox made an arrangement with Blackbird to re-brand Shipbreakers into &quot;Homeworld: Shipbreakers&quot;; officially tying the game as part of the &quot;Homeworld&quot; universe. The game is a prequel to the Homeworld series. In December 2015 the title was revealed to be &quot;&quot;. It was released on January 20, 2016.

===Remake===
On July 19, 2013, Gearbox announced the release of &quot;Homeworld HD&quot; and &quot;Homeworld 2 HD&quot; remakes, along with the original versions of the games, for 2014. In March 2014 &quot;Homeworld HD&quot; was renamed to &quot;Homeworld Remastered Collection&quot;. After missing the original deadline in 2014, &quot;Homeworld Remastered Collection&quot; was released on February 25, 2015. The collection includes the original (with LAN multiplayer gaming removed) and remastered versions of &quot;Homeworld&quot; and &quot;Homeworld 2&quot;. The Remastered versions are both built on the &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; engine and have high resolution textures and models, new graphical effects, recreated cinematic scenes, and support for HD, Ultra HD and 4K resolutions. Multiplayer for both games has been combined into one centralised mode. The &quot;Homeworld Remastered Collection&quot; was released on February 25, 2015. Aspyr Media released the Homeworld Remastered Collection for OSX via the Mac App store on August 6, 2015.

===Sequel===
Following successful planning and support, publisher Gearbox produced &quot;Homeworld 3&quot;, a sequel to the original series of games. Development of the game was partially funded through the crowdfunding platform Fig in late 2019. The game was developed by Blackbird Interactive and released on May 13, 2024.

<text>In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context.
A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.

Once performed by hand, POS tagging is now done in the context of computational linguistics, using algorithms which associate discrete terms, as well as hidden parts of speech, by a set of descriptive tags. POS-tagging algorithms fall into two distinctive groups: rule-based and stochastic. E. Brill&#x27;s tagger, one of the first and most widely used English POS-taggers, employs rule-based algorithms.

==Principle==

Part-of-speech tagging is harder than just having a list of words and their parts of speech, because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times, and because some parts of speech are complex. This is not rare—in natural languages (as opposed to many artificial languages), a large percentage of word-forms are ambiguous. For example, even &quot;dogs&quot;, which is usually thought of as just a plural noun, can also be a verb:
: The sailor dogs the hatch.
Correct grammatical tagging will reflect that &quot;dogs&quot; is here used as a verb, not as the more common plural noun. Grammatical context is one way to determine this; semantic analysis can also be used to infer that &quot;sailor&quot; and &quot;hatch&quot; implicate &quot;dogs&quot; as 1) in the nautical context and 2) an action applied to the object &quot;hatch&quot; (in this context, &quot;dogs&quot; is a nautical term meaning &quot;fastens (a watertight door) securely&quot;).

===Tag sets===
Schools commonly teach that there are 9 parts of speech in English: noun, verb, article, adjective, preposition, pronoun, adverb, conjunction, and interjection. However, there are clearly many more categories and sub-categories. For nouns, the plural, possessive, and singular forms can be distinguished. In many languages words are also marked for their &quot;case&quot; (role as subject, object, etc.), grammatical gender, and so on; while verbs are marked for tense, aspect, and other things. In some tagging systems, different inflections of the same root word will get different parts of speech, resulting in a large number of tags. For example, NN for singular common nouns, NNS for plural common nouns, NP for singular proper nouns (see the POS tags used in the Brown Corpus). Other tagging systems use a smaller number of tags and ignore fine differences or model them as features somewhat independent from part-of-speech.

In part-of-speech tagging by computer, it is typical to distinguish from 50 to 150 separate parts of speech for English. Work on stochastic methods for tagging Koine Greek (DeRose 1990) has used over 1,000 parts of speech and found that about as many words were ambiguous in that language as in English. A morphosyntactic descriptor in the case of morphologically rich languages is commonly expressed using very short mnemonics, such as &quot;Ncmsan&quot; for Category=Noun, Type = common, Gender = masculine, Number = singular, Case = accusative, Animate = no.

The most popular &quot;tag set&quot; for POS tagging for American English is probably the Penn tag set, developed in the Penn Treebank project. It is largely similar to the earlier Brown Corpus and LOB Corpus tag sets, though much smaller. In Europe, tag sets from the Eagles Guidelines see wide use and include versions for multiple languages.

POS tagging work has been done in a variety of languages, and the set of POS tags used varies greatly with language. Tags usually are designed to include overt morphological distinctions, although this leads to inconsistencies such as case-marking for pronouns but not nouns in English, and much larger cross-language differences. The tag sets for heavily inflected languages such as Greek and Latin can be very large; tagging &quot;words&quot; in agglutinative languages such as Inuit languages may be virtually impossible. At the other extreme, Petrov et al. have proposed a &quot;universal&quot; tag set, with 12 categories (for example, no subtypes of nouns, verbs, punctuation, and so on). Whether a very small set of very broad tags or a much larger set of more precise ones is preferable, depends on the purpose at hand. Automatic tagging is easier on smaller tag-sets.

==History==

===The Brown Corpus===

Research on part-of-speech tagging has been closely tied to corpus linguistics. The first major corpus of English for computer analysis was the Brown Corpus developed at Brown University by Henry Kučera and W. Nelson Francis, in the mid-1960s. It consists of about 1,000,000 words of running English prose text, made up of 500 samples from randomly chosen publications. Each sample is 2,000 or more words (ending at the first sentence-end after 2,000 words, so that the corpus contains only complete sentences).

The Brown Corpus was painstakingly &quot;tagged&quot; with part-of-speech markers over many years. A first approximation was done with a program by Greene and Rubin, which consisted of a huge handmade list of what categories could co-occur at all. For example, article then noun can occur, but article then verb (arguably) cannot. The program got about 70% correct. Its results were repeatedly reviewed and corrected by hand, and later users sent in errata so that by the late 70s the tagging was nearly perfect (allowing for some cases on which even human speakers might not agree).

This corpus has been used for innumerable studies of word-frequency and of part-of-speech and inspired the development of similar &quot;tagged&quot; corpora in many other languages. Statistics derived by analyzing it formed the basis for most later part-of-speech tagging systems, such as CLAWS and VOLSUNGA. However, by this time (2005) it has been superseded by larger corpora such as the 100 million word British National Corpus, even though larger corpora are rarely so thoroughly curated.

For some time, part-of-speech tagging was considered an inseparable part of natural language processing, because there are certain cases where the correct part of speech cannot be decided without understanding the semantics or even the pragmatics of the context. This is extremely expensive, especially because analyzing the higher levels is much harder when multiple part-of-speech possibilities must be considered for each word.

===Use of hidden Markov models===
In the mid-1980s, researchers in Europe began to use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to disambiguate parts of speech, when working to tag the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus of British English. HMMs involve counting cases (such as from the Brown Corpus) and making a table of the probabilities of certain sequences. For example, once you&#x27;ve seen an article such as &#x27;the&#x27;, perhaps the next word is a noun 40% of the time, an adjective 40%, and a number 20%. Knowing this, a program can decide that &quot;can&quot; in &quot;the can&quot; is far more likely to be a noun than a verb or a modal. The same method can, of course, be used to benefit from knowledge about the following words.

More advanced (&quot;higher-order&quot;) HMMs learn the probabilities not only of pairs but triples or even larger sequences. So, for example, if you&#x27;ve just seen a noun followed by a verb, the next item may be very likely a preposition, article, or noun, but much less likely another verb.

When several ambiguous words occur together, the possibilities multiply. However, it is easy to enumerate every combination and to assign a relative probability to each one, by multiplying together the probabilities of each choice in turn. The combination with the highest probability is then chosen. The European group developed CLAWS, a tagging program that did exactly this and achieved accuracy in the 93–95% range.

Eugene Charniak points out in &quot;Statistical techniques for natural language parsing&quot; (1997) that merely assigning the most common tag to each known word and the tag &quot;proper noun&quot; to all unknowns will approach 90% accuracy because many words are unambiguous, and many others only rarely represent their less-common parts of speech.

CLAWS pioneered the field of HMM-based part of speech tagging but was quite expensive since it enumerated all possibilities. It sometimes had to resort to backup methods when there were simply too many options (the Brown Corpus contains a case with 17 ambiguous words in a row, and there are words such as &quot;still&quot; that can represent as many as 7 distinct parts of speech.

HMMs underlie the functioning of stochastic taggers and are used in various algorithms one of the most widely used being the bi-directional inference algorithm.

===Dynamic programming methods===
In 1987, Steven DeRose and Kenneth W. Church independently developed dynamic programming algorithms to solve the same problem in vastly less time. Their methods were similar to the Viterbi algorithm known for some time in other fields. DeRose used a table of pairs, while Church used a table of triples and a method of estimating the values for triples that were rare or nonexistent in the Brown Corpus (an actual measurement of triple probabilities would require a much larger corpus). Both methods achieved an accuracy of over 95%. DeRose&#x27;s 1990 dissertation at Brown University included analyses of the specific error types, probabilities, and other related data, and replicated his work for Greek, where it proved similarly effective.

These findings were surprisingly disruptive to the field of natural language processing. The accuracy reported was higher than the typical accuracy of very sophisticated algorithms that integrated part of speech choice with many higher levels of linguistic analysis: syntax, morphology, semantics, and so on. CLAWS, DeRose&#x27;s and Church&#x27;s methods did fail for some of the known cases where semantics is required, but those proved negligibly rare. This convinced many in the field that part-of-speech tagging could usefully be separated from the other levels of processing; this, in turn, simplified the theory and practice of computerized language analysis and encouraged researchers to find ways to separate other pieces as well. Markov Models became the standard method for the part-of-speech assignment.

===Unsupervised taggers===

The methods already discussed involve working from a pre-existing corpus to learn tag probabilities. It is, however, also possible to bootstrap using &quot;unsupervised&quot; tagging. Unsupervised tagging techniques use an untagged corpus for their training data and produce the tagset by induction. That is, they observe patterns in word use, and derive part-of-speech categories themselves. For example, statistics readily reveal that &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;an&quot; occur in similar contexts, while &quot;eat&quot; occurs in very different ones. With sufficient iteration, similarity classes of words emerge that are remarkably similar to those human linguists would expect; and the differences themselves sometimes suggest valuable new insights.

These two categories can be further subdivided into rule-based, stochastic, and neural approaches.

===Other taggers and methods===

Some current major algorithms for part-of-speech tagging include the Viterbi algorithm, Brill tagger, Constraint Grammar, and the Baum-Welch algorithm (also known as the forward-backward algorithm). Hidden Markov model and visible Markov model taggers can both be implemented using the Viterbi algorithm. The rule-based Brill tagger is unusual in that it learns a set of rule patterns, and then applies those patterns rather than optimizing a statistical quantity.

Many machine learning methods have also been applied to the problem of POS tagging. Methods such as SVM, maximum entropy classifier, perceptron, and nearest-neighbor have all been tried, and most can achieve accuracy above 95%.

A direct comparison of several methods is reported (with references) at the ACL Wiki. This comparison uses the Penn tag set on some of the Penn Treebank data, so the results are directly comparable. However, many significant taggers are not included (perhaps because of the labor involved in reconfiguring them for this particular dataset). Thus, it should not be assumed that the results reported here are the best that can be achieved with a given approach; nor even the best that &quot;have&quot; been achieved with a given approach.

In 2014, a paper reporting using the structure regularization method for part-of-speech tagging, achieving 97.36% on a standard benchmark dataset.

<doc id="746913" wikidata="Q3471155" url="?curid=746913" title="Samuel Rosenman">
<text>Samuel Irving Rosenman (February 13, 1896 – June 24, 1973) was an American lawyer, judge, Democratic Party activist, and presidential speechwriter. He coined the term &quot;New Deal&quot;, and helped articulate liberal policies during the heyday of the New Deal coalition. He was the first person to hold the position of White House Counsel.

==Personal life and political career==
Rosenman was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Solomon and Ethel (Paler) Rosenman, both Jews. He served in the US Army during World War I and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1919. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Delta Sigma Rho.

He became active in Democratic politics and was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 11th D.) in 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926; and a justice of the New York Supreme Court (1st D.) from 1936 to 1943. By the mid-1930s, Rosenman had emerged as a leading spokesman for the New York Jewish community.

Rosenman was a senior advisor to presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Under their administrations, he was a leading figure in the war crimes issue. He was also the first official White House Counsel, then called Special Counsel, between 1943 and 1946.

He was a speechwriter under both presidents, helping Roosevelt with his speeches from his days as governor. Rosenman was responsible for the term &quot;New Deal&quot;, a phrase in the conclusion of FDR&#x27;s acceptance speech at the 1932 Democratic National Convention. While he was not heavily involved in speechwriting during Roosevelt&#x27;s first term, he started traveling to Washington to help out with important talks during the 1936 campaign and was a key speech aide for the remainder of Roosevelt&#x27;s life. He officially joined the White House after ill health forced him to have to choose between his judicial work and his presidential work.

Beginning in 1940, Rosenman was frequently engaged by F.D.R. to assist in the reorganization of Government agencies to create greater efficiency in war mobilization. He coordinated the meetings and discussions that led to the reorganization of agencies overseeing production of war materials, allocation of resources, housing, control of inflation and other domestic concerns critical to the war effort.

He submitted his resignation as Special Counsel upon Roosevelt&#x27;s death but Truman asked him to stay on, initially through V-E Day, then through V-J Day, and finally into 1946. Rosenman wrote the 1946 State of the Union Address for Truman on his own in 1946. Even after leaving the White House, he would periodically return to aid the president with major speeches, including his acceptance speech to the 1948 Democratic National Convention.

Rosenman&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Working with Roosevelt,&quot; is one of the most quoted and praised first-person accounts of the Roosevelt administration.

Rosenman was married to housing activist Dorothy Rosenman. Rosenman&#x27;s granddaughter Lynn is the wife of current United States Attorney General and former United States Supreme Court Nominee, Merrick Garland.

==Editor==
Rosenman edited &quot;The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;, published in 13 volumes from 1938 to 1950. They have extensive notes; the last four volumes published under Rosenman&#x27;s name, notes to the earlier volumes published as Roosevelt&#x27;s. The volumes have been immensely influential in the study of the New Deal and Roosevelt&#x27;s policies; given the enormous mass of data at the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, the papers have been used by historians as a guide, a conceptual framework, and a source. While his selections have given rise to some accusations of partisan selectivity and of deviations from the content of delivered speeches, the work still holds up remarkably well as an important piece of scholarship, and Rosenman will long be remembered as the Thucydides of the Roosevelt era, according to Hand (1968).

==Holocaust==
As a member of the American Jewish Committee, Rosenman was actively involved in addressing issues of concern to the Jewish community. He was a member of its Survey Committee which worked to reduce antisemitism in the United States by promoting national unity. The Committee considered some of the actions of Jewish activists as unproductive in promoting, rather than dispelling, notions of difference rather than of unity. The Survey Committee believed that the most effective answer to antisemitism was to attack it as Unamerican in its divisive purpose. The Survey Committee emphasized the importance of unity in standing up to the Nazi menace, and was influential, in part through Rosenman, in having F.D.R. promote and emphasize national unity in many of his speeches before and after the U.S. entry into World War 2.

On October 6, 1943, three days before Yom Kippur, Hillel Kook (aka Peter Bergson) organized a march to Washington DC (the famous Rabbis March) by a delegation of some 400 rabbis, most if not all Orthodox and some recent immigrants, to make a public appeal to the United States government to do more to try to rescue the abandoned Jews of Europe. It was the only such protest in Washington during the Holocaust. The rabbis were received at the steps of the Capitol by the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the Speaker of the House. After prayers for the war effort at the Lincoln Memorial, the rabbis went to the White House to plead with President Roosevelt and were told that the President was busy all day and Vice President Henry Wallace met them instead. It was later learned that Roosevelt had several free hours that afternoon, but was advised by both Stephen Wise (head of the World Jewish Congress) and Rosenman (who, in addition to being the President&#x27;s advisor and speech writer, also headed the American Jewish Committee) that the protesting rabbis &quot;were not representative&quot; of American Jewry and not the kind of Jews he should meet. Wise also accused the rabbis of &quot;offending the dignity of the Jewish people.&quot;

Historian Rafael Medoff, founder of The David Wyman Institute (named after Holocaust historian David Wyman) characterizes Rosenman this way: &quot;One of FDR’s top advisers and speechwriters was Samuel Rosenman, a leading member of the American Jewish Committee. Rosenman, a deeply assimilated Jew, was uncomfortable calling attention to Jewish concerns. During the 1930&#x27;s, antisemitism was increasing in the United States, stoked by the virulent tirades of popular antisemitic personalities such as Father Charles Coughlin, and later aided, perhaps unwittingly, by the arguments of ardent isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh. Rosenman was sensitive to the destructive charges that Roosevelt was led by a &quot;Jewish cabal&quot; and, as with many leading Jews, fearful that antisemitism in the United States could increase further. After the 1938 Kristallnacht pogroms, he warned FDR that admitting German Jewish refugees to America would “create a Jewish problem in the U.S.”

==Later career==
From 1964 to 1966, Rosenman served as president of the New York City Bar Association. He was also the name partner of Rosenman &amp; Colin that merged with Katten Muchin &amp; Zavis to become Katten Muchin Rosenman. He also briefly served as chairman of 20th century Fox in 1962.

<text>Ida Rosenthal (née Kaganovich; January 9, 1886 – March 29, 1973) was a Belarusian-born American dressmaker and businesswoman who co-founded Maidenform. Ida is considered to be the creator of the modern bra and her company Maidenform went on to become the most successful bra manufacturer in the world.

==Biography==
She was born to a Jewish family in Rakaŭ, near Minsk, then part of the Russian Empire. her father was a Hebrew scholar and her mother ran a small general store.

 At the age of 18, she emigrated to the United States, following her fiancé William Rosenthal, and Americanized her (maiden) name to Cohen. Those who knew her well called her Itel. In 1907 she got married and partnershiped with her husband.

In 1921, along with Enid Bisset, she opened up a dress shop, which a year later was registered the name Maiden Form. In 1925 the first Maidenform plant was opened in Bayonne, New Jersey to focus solely on their most popular product, brassieres (although the company later produced lingerie and swimwear as well). Despite the Great Depression and Enid&#x27;s retirement, the partnership was very successful and expanded into markets across the United States, Europe and Latin America.

The Maidenform bra originated as an accessory to improve the fit of the dresses they sold, but it became so popular that they began to sell it separately. Their product was a major improvement over previous bras, because they used cups that supported and conformed to the breasts, rather than flattening them as had been the Flapper style (known as the &quot;Boyish Form&quot;).

Under Ida and her husband&#x27;s leadership, Maidenform made many other advancements. Maidenform was the first company to sell maternity bras, and William invented a standard for cup sizes. In 1942, Ida received a patent for an adjustable fastener. During this time, Maidenform was also known for its racy newspaper ads featuring underwear models and its advertising slogan &quot;I dreamed... in a Maidenform Bra.&quot;

During World War II her company Maidenform designed and produced vest for homing pigeons. These vest allowed paratroopers to carry birds with them when they parachuted behind enemy lines.

After William&#x27;s death in 1958, Ida became the company president. Ida died in 1973 of pneumonia, leaving the company in control of her son-in-law Dr. Joseph Coleman. Upon Coleman&#x27;s death in 1968, Ida&#x27;s daughter Beatrice Rosenthal Coleman gained control over the company.

Today Maidenform is owned by Hanesbrands and is currently being run by Ida&#x27;s Granddaughter, Elizabeth Coleman.

== Jewish Causes ==
Ida did a lot more during her life including numerous charitable organizations which she supported or founded later in her life. A few Jewish Causes she and her husband became involved in included Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith and the United Jewish Appeal. The United Jewish Appeal focused on providing to relief to Jewish Europeans during and following WWII.

In 1942, Ida and William presented Solomon Rosenthal&#x27;s collection of Hebrew books to New York University. This went on to become the William and Ida Rosenthal Collection. Ten years later a foundation in honor of Ida made sure a librarian would be paid to care for the collection. During this period they also established the Ida and William Rosenthal Fellowship in Judaica and Hebraic at New York University.

The couple founded Camp Lewis in Rockaway, New Jersey in 1943 for the Boy Scouts of America, in memory of their son Lewis, who died in 1930 at the age of 23. The camp continued to operate has been sold as of 2025.

<doc id="746918" wikidata="Q233876" url="?curid=746918" title="Teresa Berganza">
<text>Teresa Berganza Vargas (16 March 1933 – 13 May 2022) was a Spanish mezzo-soprano. She is most closely associated with roles such as Rossini&#x27;s Rosina and La Cenerentola, and later Bizet&#x27;s Carmen, admired for her technical virtuosity, musical intelligence, and beguiling stage presence. 

Berganza was a key singer in a Rossini renaissance which explored less-performed operas and restored the leading roles to mezzo register. She appeared as Zerlina in Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; film in 1979. She participated in the opening ceremonies of the Expo &#x27;92 in Seville and of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

== Life and career ==
Teresa Berganza was born in Madrid on 16 March 1933. She studied piano and voice at the Madrid Royal Conservatory, voice with Lola Rodríguez Aragón, where she was awarded first prize for singing in 1954. She made her concert debut in Madrid in 1955.

Berganza made her operatic debut as Dorabella in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in 1957 at the Aix-en-Provence Festival. That same year, she made her La Scala debut. She first appeared at the Glyndebourne Festival in 1958, as Cherubino in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, and later also in the title role of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;. In 1959, Berganza made her first appearance at the Royal Opera House as Cherubino, and the following year performed there as Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, which became one of her signature roles. She repeated it at the Zürich Opera House, where she returned in 1979 as Charlotte in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;.

She appeared in the U.S. first in 1958, at the Dallas Opera as Isabella in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; and then as Neris in Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot; alongside Maria Callas in the title role. In 1967, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut, again as Cherubino, directed by Nikolaus Lehnhoff in his house debut, and conducted by Joseph Rosenstock, alongside Cesare Siepi as Figaro, Mirella Freni as Susanna, Tom Krause and Pilar Lorengar as the Almaviva couple. She returned for Rosina the following year, first in a telecast performance conducted by Richard Bonynge, alongside Mario Sereni as Figaro, Luigi Alva and Fernando Corena as Bartolo. A reviewer from the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; noted:

Berganza was a leading singer for a renaissance of Rossini&#x27;s operas, returning the roles to the original lower register according to critical editions by Alberto Zedda, promoted by conductors such as Claudio Abbado and Charles Mackerras.

Berganza appeared at the 1977 Edinburgh Festival as Bizet&#x27;s Carmen, conducted by Abbado, regarded as one of her greatest successes on stage, and repeated the role at the Paris Opera. She portrayed the character with intelligence, singing the Habanera with the flexibility of a lieder singer, and abrupt changes in timbre and dynamic, seemingly addressing the crowd but meaning one person, in a provokingly light tone demonstrating superiority.
As a recitalist, Berganza made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1964. Her concert repertoire includes Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Russian songs. From 1957 to 1977, Berganza was married to the composer and pianist Félix Lavilla, who accompanied her in recitals and recordings. The couple had three children, including soprano Cecilia Lavilla Berganza. She showcased songs from Spain, from medieval cantigas from the era of Alfonso X of Castile to miniatures by Manuel de Falla and Enrique Granados.

For the opening of the National Auditorium of Music in Madrid, she performed in De Falla&#x27;s Atlántida alongside Montserrat Caballé and Vicente. She participated in the concert for the opening of the Opéra Bastille in Paris on 13 July 1989. In 1992, Berganza participated in the opening ceremonies of Expo &#x27;92 in Seville and the opening ceremonies of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Berganza&#x27;s stage career ended in 2008. She last taught singing at the Escuela Superior de Música Reina Sofía, continued to perform music of Spanish composers, and gave master classes all over the world. Her students have included María Bayo, Jorge Chaminé and Alicia Nafé.

Berganza died on 13 May 2022 in San Lorenzo de El Escorial at age 89.

== Films ==
Berganza appeared in nine motion pictures, including &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; in 1972, as Zerlina in Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in 1979, and both Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot; and Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1980.

== Honours ==
Berganza received a Gold Medal of Merit in Fine Arts from the Kingdom of Spain on 26 February 1982. She shared the 1991 Prince of Asturias Award for arts and letters with six other Spanish singers. In 1994, she became the first woman elected to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. In 1996, she was awarded the Premio Nacional de Música. She also received the Grand Prix Rossini. She was awarded the Dame Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise from the Kingdom of Spain on 3 May 2013. She received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2018 International Opera Awards.

<text>Julius Rosenwald (August 12, 1862 – January 6, 1932) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He is best known as a part-owner and leader of Sears, Roebuck and Company, and for establishing the Rosenwald Fund, which donated millions in matching funds to promote vocational or technical education. In 1919 he was appointed to the Chicago Commission on Race Relations. He was also the principal founder and backer for the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, to which he gave more than $5 million and served as president from 1927 to 1932.

==Early life==

Julius Rosenwald was born in 1862 to the clothier Samuel Rosenwald and his wife Augusta (Hammerslough), a Jewish immigrant couple from Germany. Julius Rosenwald was Samuel and Augusta’s second child to survive infancy. He was born and raised just a few blocks from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s residence in Springfield, Illinois, during Lincoln&#x27;s presidency. In 2020, the house, formerly known as &quot;Lyon House&quot;, was renamed in his honor, and a plaque erected.

Additionally, Samuel Rosenwald served as the president of the B’rith Sholom synagogue of the Springfield Hebrew Congregation, where Julius received a Jewish education and learned lifelong lessons to shape his values.

By his sixteenth year, Rosenwald was apprenticed by his parents to his uncles in New York City to learn the clothing trades. While in New York, he befriended Henry Goldman and Henry Morgenthau Sr. With his younger brother Morris, Rosenwald started a clothing manufacturing company.

Rosenwald had heard about other clothiers who had begun to manufacture clothing according to standardized sizes from data collected during the American Civil War. He decided to try the system but to move his manufacturing facility closer to the rural population that he anticipated would be his market. He and his brother moved to Chicago, Illinois.

==Marriage and family==
In 1890, Rosenwald married Augusta &quot;Gussie&quot; Nusbaum, a daughter of a competing clothier. Together they had five children: Lessing J. Rosenwald, Adele (Rosenwald) Deutsch Levy, Edith (Rosenwald) Stern, Marion (Rosenwald) Ascoli―second wife of Italian American journalist Max Ascoli―and William Rosenwald. Their son Lessing Rosenwald became a prominent businessman, following his father in the chairmanship of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company (1932–1939). Edith married businessman Edgar B. Stern Sr.

One of his grandchildren is Nina Rosenwald. Another was the Hollywood film producer Armand Deutsch, who believed that he was the intended target of the thrill killers Leopold and Loeb, who kidnapped and murdered his schoolmate Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Franks on May 21, 1924.

==Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company==

In 1893, Richard Sears and Alvah C. Roebuck renamed their watch company Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company and began to diversify. Rosenwald and Weil was a principal supplier of men&#x27;s clothing for Sears, Roebuck. The volumes of unsold merchandise caused by the Panic of 1893 and his declining health led Roebuck to leave the company.

Roebuck placed his interest in the company in the hands of Sears who, in turn, offered that half of the company be sold to Chicago businessman Aaron Nusbaum, who in turn brought in Rosenwald, to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, Sears sold Roebuck&#x27;s half of the company to Nusbaum and Rosenwald for $75,000. The new Sears, Roebuck and Company was re-incorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 in August 1895. Sears and Rosenwald got along well, but Nusbaum, who was Gussie Rosenwald&#x27;s brother, was a problem. Sears and Rosenwald bought him out for $1.3 million in 1903.

Rosenwald brought to the company a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire. The company&#x27;s initiative at this time was particularly fortuitous with the initiation of Rural Free Delivery by the Post Office in 1896. From 1895 to 1907, under Rosenwald&#x27;s leadership as vice president and treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed from $750,000 to upwards of $50 million. The prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with $40 million in stock. Rosenwald turned to his old friend Henry Goldman, who was now a senior partner at Goldman Sachs, to handle the initial public offering of the stock. After Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, Rosenwald was named president.

On January 2, 1915, Rosenwald was indicted in Chicago for a failure to file a personal property tax schedule. One commenter described the indictment as &quot;a shot heard around the world&quot;. Prior to the indictment the Tax Board of Review scheduled the value of Rosenwald&#x27;s Sears&#x27; stock at $7,500,000. Rosenwald declared this to be greatly excessive and additionally claimed that the stock of the New York company did not represent tangible assets. The indictment was quashed in March 1915 when Rosenwald&#x27;s attorneys convinced the Court that the section of law which provided for prosecution of such cases had been repealed.

The company was laid low during the post-World War I recession as a severe depression hit the nation&#x27;s farms after farmers had over-expanded their holdings. To bail out the company, Rosenwald pledged $21 million of his personal wealth. By 1922, Sears had regained financial stability. Two years later, in 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy. First he oversaw the design and construction of the company&#x27;s first department store within Sears, Roebuck&#x27;s massive 16-hectare (40-acre) headquarters complex of offices, laboratories, and mail-order operations at Homan Ave. and Arthington St. on Chicago&#x27;s West Side. The store opened on February 2, 1925. After leaving the presidency, Rosenwald was appointed chairman of the Board of Sears, a position he held until his death in 1932.

==Philanthropy==

Julius Rosenwald had a simple philosophy when it came to philanthropy. He explained, “What I want to do is try and cure the things that seem wrong”. A major focus of Rosenwald’s philanthropic work stemmed from his desire to eradicate antisemitism in the U.S. and worldwide. 

Additionally, Rosenwald was concerned about justice for all, and he believed that the plight of African Americans was deeply connected with the inequities faced by Jews throughout their history. This became even more important to him after meeting Booker T. Washington before the start of the first World War. He explained that his desire to improve education for African Americans in the U.S. when he said that “very few persons are interested in the education of the Negro that I have deemed it wiser to concentrate my efforts in that direction”. Rosenwald’s philanthropic pursuits thus combined his strong sense of responsibility to aid in social inequality with his reverence for education and learning.

After the 1906 financial reorganization of Sears, Rosenwald became friends with Goldman Sachs&#x27;s other senior partner, Paul J. Sachs, who often stayed with Rosenwald during his many trips to Chicago. The two would discuss America&#x27;s social situation, agreeing that the plight of African Americans was the most serious in the U.S. Sachs introduced Rosenwald to two prominent educators and proponents of African-American education, William H. Baldwin and Booker T. Washington. Rosenwald made common cause with Washington and was asked to serve on the board of directors of the Tuskegee Institute in 1912, a position he held for the remainder of his life. He endowed the institute to free Washington from fundraising and enable him to devote more time managing the institute.

Rosenwald became a member of the city&#x27;s leading Jewish Reform congregation, Chicago Sinai congregation, soon after moving to Chicago. Its rabbi, Emil G. Hirsch, made an impact on Rosenwald&#x27;s philanthropy. Rosenwald donated generously to several Jewish community projects in Chicago and served as vice president of Chicago Sinai for many years.

===African American education===
Booker T. Washington encouraged Rosenwald to address the poor state of African-American education in the U.S., which suffered from inadequate buildings and books. Rosenwald provided funds to build six small schools in rural Alabama, which were constructed and opened in 1913 and 1914, and overseen by Tuskegee. As the projects were built by and for African Americans, they showed Rosenwald&#x27;s intention to remain behind the scenes in this effort. Inspired by the social progressivism of Jane Addams, Grace Abbott, Paul J. Sachs, and the Reform Judaism of Emil Hirsch and Julian Mack (many of whom were personal friends as well), Rosenwald devoted his time, energy, and money to philanthropy.

In his words, written in 1911:

The horrors that are due to race prejudice come home to the Jew more forcefully than to others of the white race, on account of the centuries of persecution which they have suffered and still suffer.

The collaboration between Booker T. Washington and Julius Rosenwald was the subject of the 2015 documentary &quot;Rosenwald&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Remarkable Story of a Jewish Partnership with African American Communities&quot; by writer, producer and director Aviva Kempner, which won Best Documentary Jury Award at the Teaneck International Film Festival and the Lipscomb University Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, Nashville Film Festival.

He established his Rosenwald Fund in 1917 for &quot;the well-being of mankind&quot;. Unlike other endowed foundations, which were designed to fund themselves in perpetuity, the Rosenwald Fund was intended to use all of its funds for philanthropic purposes. As a result, the fund was completely spent by 1948.
===Schools, universities, and museums===
Over the course of his life, Rosenwald and his fund donated over $70 million to public schools, colleges and universities, museums, Jewish charities and African-American institutions. The rural school building program was one of the largest programs administered by the Rosenwald Fund. This program eventually was responsible for construction in the South of more than 5,000 schools and shops for African-American children, as well as homes for their teachers. These schools became informally known as &quot;Rosenwald Schools&quot;.

Rosenwald commissioned one of Chicago&#x27;s largest philanthropic housing developments: the Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments, at 47th St. and Michigan Ave. The Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments was one of the first American housing developments to mix residential, commercial and social uses and still stands.

The complex was built in 1929 by Julius Rosenwald and his nephew, architect Ernest Grunsfeld (who also designed the Adler Planetarium, at the behest of Rosenwald&#x27;s brother-in-law, Max Adler). Covering a square block, the buildings enclosed an enormous central landscaped courtyard. Rosenwald planned the development of 421 units to provide sound housing for African Americans and to relieve the tremendous overcrowding due to Chicago&#x27;s pervasive racial segregation. The development also included 14 stores along the 47th Street side of the property, four of which were occupied by black-owned businesses, and a nursery school. Rosenwald invested $2.7 million in the project, receiving only a 2.4 percent return during the first seven years.

===YMCAs for African Americans===
In 1910, the YMCA asked Rosenwald to fund a proposal for a new building in Chicago; Rosenwald replied that he would contribute only if a center for African Americans were also constructed. The result was the Wabash Avenue YMCA, opened in 1914, which would later become an historic landmark. The Wabash &quot;Y&quot; greatly aided blacks&#x27; integration into Chicago during the Great Migration. It is still operating today.

Rosenwald went on to offer challenge grants to cities across the United States to build YMCAs for African Americans. Rosenwald promised to give $25,000 to any city that could raise $75,000 to build a YMCA for African Americans. Between 1911 and 1933, Rosenwald provided over $600,000 toward the building of 25 YMCAs in 24 cities across the United States, including one in Harlem.

===Samuel Reshevsky===
Rosenwald was the patron of chess prodigy Samuel Reshevsky. He encouraged Reshevsky to earn a university degree so as not to be completely dependent upon chess for his living. Reshevsky did so, earning his degree in accounting from the University of Chicago.

===County Extension===
Rosenwald gave $1000 grants to the first 100 counties in the U.S. to hire County Extension Agents, helping the United States Department of Agriculture launch a program that was highly valuable to rural Americans. He was also the principal founder and backer for the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, to which he gave over $5 million and served as the president (1927–1932).

==Death and legacy==
Rosenwald died at his home, now Rosewood Park, in the Ravinia section of Highland Park, Illinois, on January 6, 1932.

* His bust was created in bronze, and it was among those of eight honored industry magnates which were installed between the Chicago River and the Merchandise Mart in downtown Chicago, Illinois.
*During World War II, the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.
* He was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1992.
* A 2015 film &quot;Rosenwald&quot; directed by Aviva Kempner documents his life and philanthropy.
* A Chicago Public School system elementary school, located at 2601 W 80th Street on Chicago&#x27;s Southwest Side, was named after Rosenwald in 1952.
* Rosenwald&#x27;s boyhood home, which is part of the Lincoln Home National Historic Site, was renamed in his honor in 2020. A plaque there commemorates his work.
When looking back on his life and success, Rosenwald declared, &quot;Most people are of the opinion that because a man has made a fortune that his opinions on any subject are valuable. For my part, I always believe most large fortunes are made by men of mediocre ability who tumbled into a lucky opportunity and couldn’t help but get rich and that others, given the same chance, would have done far better with it.&quot; Thus, although Julius Rosenwald is one of Chicago&#x27;s most admired Jewish businessmen, he maintained a low profile throughout his life. He refused to be the source of biographies and did not want his name to be affixed on buildings or institutions. He even insisted that his generous philanthropic contributions be matched by others so that he would not be credited with the title of &#x27;sole donor&#x27;. However, he is well-remembered today through many books, such as &quot;Julius Rosenwald: The Man Who Built Sears, Roebuck and Advanced the Cause of Black Education in the American South&quot; by Peter M. Ascoli, and &quot;Julius Rosenwald: Repairing the World&quot; by Hasia R. Diner.

<text>Charles Griffith Ross (November 9, 1885 – December 5, 1950) was White House Press Secretary between 1945 and 1950 for President Harry S. Truman.

==Early life==
Ross graduated with Truman and Truman&#x27;s eventual wife Bess Truman in Independence, Missouri from Independence High School (now known as William Chrisman High School), Class of 1901. He was initiated into the Sigma Chi fraternity and graduated from the University of Missouri in 1905. In 1908, he became the first professor of the newly formed Missouri School of Journalism.

==Pulitzer Prize==

In 1918, he became the Chief Washington correspondent for the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;. He won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize for his article titled, &quot;&quot;, a discussion of the economic situation of the United States.

In 1934, he became the editorial page editor for the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; and then in 1939 became a contributing editor for the paper.

==White House Press Secretary==
In 1945, Truman asked Ross to become his Press Secretary.

Despite his long-standing personal relationship with Truman, Ross gained a reputation for trustworthiness since reporters knew he spoke for the president both on and off the record. Very few reporters felt Ross led them astray either.

===Death===
Ross died of a coronary occlusion at his desk in the White House in December 1950 after giving a press conference as he was preparing to make some comments to the television news. He was buried in Washington&#x27;s Mount Olivet Cemetery.

==Family==
His widow, Florence Griffin, married &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; editor Roy A. Roberts in 1953.

<doc id="746939" wikidata="Q6082477" url="?curid=746939" title="Islamic Fun">
<text>Islamic Fun (also known as Islamic Fun!) is a 1999 religious and educational video game, consisting of six minigames targeted at children. The game was developed by the United Kingdom-based firm Innovative Minds. The game is notable for its minigame &quot;The Resistance,&quot; which allowed players to throw rocks at Israeli tanks upon correctly answering trivia. The game&#x27;s message was supported by Innovative Minds&#x27; &quot;Boycott Israel&quot; page and campaign, which aimed to raise awareness about the treatment of Palestinians in Israel.

== Development ==

=== Design ===
The subgenre of religious educational video game usually consists of simple games targeted to a young audience, with uncomplicated plots and goals, and with the main purpose of teaching players about the main principles of that particular faith. While the purpose of such games are religious education, some of the context and ideology behind them, which view certain political events through the value-laden prism of a specific group, may prove to be problematic to other faiths. In creating the game, Innovative Minds was unconcerned with this and instead focused their efforts on designing an educational game with colourful animation and sound effects that would teach players about Islamic [Surah] and ahādīth. Innovative Minds&#x27; stated educational goal for the game is to &quot;offer Muslim-inspired children&#x27;s video games and other resources online in order to strengthen users&#x27; knowledge about Islam&quot;, including to encourage a better understanding of Islam in the West. In the case of &quot;The Resistance&quot;, the game&#x27;s authors argue that it was &quot;designed to respond to Zionist expansion and aggression&quot;.

=== Release and aftermath ===
&quot;Islamic Fun&quot; was released by Innovative Minds, under the direction of Abbas Panjwani, in 1999. It was distributed from his suburban home in Crawley. The game marketed itself as a Muslim alternative to secular video games. The game only became noticed by the Jewish community over three years after being originally produced in December 2001, after Innovative Minds boycotted Israeli goods on their website. The Board of Deputies of British Jews investigated the legal status of the game in the hopes of making it illegal, but were advised by lawyers there is no current legislation to make this possible.

Panjwani noted that as a result of the boycott, his family had received violent threats, abusive phone calls, several hundred hate e-mails a day, and threats against their website&#x27;s host providers, and commented that &quot;this matter of the game [Islamic Fun] is the latest of a whole series of abuse we have been receiving simply for practising our right to oppose illegal occupation and atrocities committed by the state of Israel&quot;. Subsequent to the boycott incident, the game would receive much media attention in the Western World, particularly after the 2005 London commuter terrorist bombings along with other Islamic games.

Game Revolution noted that as of 2013, the games do not function online.

== Gameplay ==
All the games in the package involve answering a series of multiple choice questions on a range of Islamic themes. Three levels of questions are available, for children of 5–7 years, 8–10 years, and 11 years and older.

=== Minigames ===

== Critical reception and analysis ==

The game became controversial due to the perceived anti-Zionism of &quot;The Resistance&quot; game, and for some of the questions themselves, which seemed designed to promote an Islamist world view. It caused critical
reactions in the Western media due to the minigame &quot;The Resistance&quot; and the quotations in other puzzle games.

The document &quot;Games: A Look at Emerging Trends, Uses, Threats and Opportunities in Influence Activities&quot; argued that these types of games &quot;encourage anti-Semitism and promote terrorism&quot;. The book &quot;Global Radical Islamist Insurgency&quot; commented that while game lacked the &quot;overtly violent&quot; nature of other Jihadi games, &quot;The Resistance&quot; minigame &quot;seeks to condition youth to consider violence the appropriate emotional response to perceived injustice&quot;. The book deemed the other five minigames &quot;child-friendly amusements&quot;. Upon reading the description of &quot;The Resistance&quot; Chicago Sun-Times&#x27;s Zay N. Smith responded &quot;Uh. Oh, never mind&quot;, believing that the game showed a &quot;lack of sense in sensitivity&quot;.

The Independent thought the game consisted of a series of &quot;simple games&quot; that aimed to teach players about aspects of Islam, and deemed &quot;The Resistance&quot; the game&#x27;s &quot;standout&quot;. In an article entitled &quot;The most bizarre religious video games ever&quot;, Grunge noted that some of the questions are asked in an &quot;awfully curious way&quot; deeming the game less &quot;fun trivia&quot; and more &quot;shiny, happy propaganda&quot;, while commenting that in &quot;The Resistance&quot;, &quot;you are now murdering Jews in a supposedly G-rated religious game&quot;. Slate thought the title was one of the &quot;War on Terror&#x27;s least-frightening video games&quot;, though noted that the content would appeal to Jihadist gamers. The New York Post deemed the game &quot;sickening&quot; and &quot;shocking&quot;, and noted that The Board of Deputies of British Jews had made a concerted effort to pull the self-described &quot;tragedy&quot; from toy stores. In &quot;Jihad for Kids : Free Congress Foundation&quot;, Robert Spencer wrote that the game “instills ancient Islamic resentments in today’s youth”.

&quot;Halos and Avatars: Playing Video Games with God&quot; notes that despite the controversial nature of the &quot;flagged&quot; minigame &quot;The Resistance&quot;, some of the minigames such as &quot;Fishing Bear&quot; are &quot;nonreligious-oriented&quot;. The book noted that several press outlets had cited a potential connection between &quot;Arab-focus warfare games&quot; like &quot;The Resistance&quot; with reports that Al-Qaeda leaders have used similar games to help train terrorists. Furthermore, the book negatively compared the game to &quot;Abu Isa&#x27;s Quest For Knowledge&quot;, which used its platform as a tool to impart messages about patience and empathy through practical subjects of religious education. This is in contrast to Islamic Fun, which uses theoretical subjects of religious education, the which playing through a particular scenario teaches reinforces core values. In its opinion, the title, situated within the genre of Islamogaming, crossed the line from religious teaching to ideological instruction.

Game Revolution thought that &quot;The Resistance&quot; has the &quot;kind of radical militant action that paralyzes Americans with fear&quot;, and wondered if Western-made warfare games, with foreign antagonists like in the minigame, similarly made Westerners look like &quot;blood-thirsty killing machines, ravenous for death and destruction&quot;. Snowden released a document that listed this game as one of the most likely to place the player on a terrorist watch list.

<text>158 Koronis is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Russian astronomer Viktor Knorre on January 4, 1876, from the Berlin observatory. It was the first of his four asteroid discoveries. The meaning of the asteroid name is uncertain, but it may come from Coronis the mother of Asclepius from Greek mythology. Alternatively, it may come from Coronis, a nymph of the Hyades sisterhood. The Koronis family is named after this asteroid.

From its spectrum this is classified as an S-type asteroid, indicating a stony composition. Photometric observations show a synodic rotation period of 14.206 ± 0.002 hours with a brightness variation of 0.28–0.43 in magnitude. A subsequent study at the Altimira Observatory during 2010 was in agreement with this estimate, yielding a rotation period of 14.208 ± 0.040 hours. Based on a model constructed from the lightcurve, the shape of Koronis resembles that of 243 Ida, an asteroid in the same family, although it is a bit larger. 

A collision involving 158 Koronis 15 million years ago created a cluster of 246 objects. 158 Koronis itself retained 98.7% of the total mass. These new objects formed the Koronis(2) family. Koronis(2) is a subfamily of the much larger Koronis family.

<text>Angelo Joseph Rossi (January 22, 1878 – April 5, 1948) was a U.S. political figure who served as the 31st Mayor of San Francisco from 1931 to 1944. A member of the Republican Party, he was mayor during most of both the Great Depression and World War II.

==Life and career==
Rossi was born in Volcano, Amador County, California, and came to San Francisco in 1890 with his widowed mother and six siblings after the family home and general store burned to the ground in minutes. (Rossi&#x27;s father, also named Angelo, left Italy in 1849 at age 16 aboard a ship loaded with marble that departed from Genoa. When he arrived in Amador County, he mined for gold and opened his general store.) When young Angelo arrived in San Francisco with his family, he attended school but left after sixth grade to work in jobs ranging from cash boy to clerk in a couple of different florist shops, including Carbone and Sons and Pelicano and Sons, which became Pelicano and Rossi when he became a partner in the early 1900s. Eventually he opened his own company, Angelo J. Rossi, Inc., and during his tenure in office the business continued to operate in a sparkling Art Deco building Rossi owned at 45 Grant Avenue.

When James Rolph resigned as mayor in January 1931 to become governor of California, Rossi was elected by his fellow members of the Board of Supervisors as Rolph&#x27;s successor. (Rossi had served on the Board from 1922-1926 and had just returned in 1930.) After completing the remaining year of Rolph&#x27;s term, Rossi was elected in his own right as mayor in November 1931. He was re-elected mayor for second and third full terms in 1935 and 1939.

Rossi was mayor when the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge were built, and he presided over the building of Treasure Island and the Golden Gate International Exposition (World&#x27;s Fair) of 1939-40. Under his administration, the city resisted compliance with the Raker Act, which required San Francisco to sell power from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite to municipalities or municipal water districts, and not to any corporations, a condition of use of the Hetch Hetchy Valley. Rossi dedicated the Mount Davidson Cross in March, 1934. He was a strong proponent of the New Deal alphabet-soup roster of work programs and worked vigorously and constantly with Washington to bring as many dollars to the city as possible in order to create jobs and improve the city&#x27;s infrastructure. Rossi presided over groundbreaking ceremonies for San Francisco City College in April 1937. He befriended and hosted Fiorello La Guardia in San Francisco and visited New York City as La Guardia&#x27;s guest.
Rossi was adamantly anti-Communist, and labeled the more militant labor organizing and strikes as the work of agitators. During the July 1934 general strike, Rossi organized a committee to thwart the strike and move freight; he called on Governor Frank Merriam to send the National Guard to quell the strike, but argued successfully against the governor&#x27;s wish to declare martial law. Two strikers were killed by bullets, and eighty-five were hospitalized.

On July 19, 1934, Mayor Rossi spoke on national radio, &quot;I congratulate the real leaders of organized labor on their decision and the part they have played in ending the general strike. San Francisco has stamped out without bargain or compromise an attempt to import into its life the very real danger of revolt... We will deal effectively with the small group who opposed peace and plotted revolution.&quot;

When his police force raided political offices and worker organizations after the strike, Rossi issued a statement: &quot;I pledge to you that as Chief Executive in San Francisco I will, to the full extent of my authority, run out of San Francisco every Communist agitator, and this is going to be a continuing policy in San Francisco.&quot; During a period of publicized police scandal, he asked for and appropriated $70,000 to investigate corruption in the department. The district attorney, Matthew Brady, hired Edwin Atherton, a private investigator, who published the Atherton Report on police corruption in 1937.

In an extended strike in the late 1930s, Rossi lashed out at Harry Bridges, West Coast C.I.O. leader, saying the city is &quot;sick of the alien&quot; in a telegram to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, asking for federal intervention. In May 1942, six months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, at the Tenney Committee hearings held in San Francisco, Rossi was subpoenaed, having been accused of supporting Italian fascism. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; of May 26, 1942, &quot;With tears in his eyes and a voice that broke with emotion, Mayor Angelo J. Rossi protested today his &#x27;100 per cent&#x27; loyalty to America and told a committee of the California Assembly that his presence before it as a witness was &#x27;based on the damnable lies of irresponsible people&#x27;.&quot; He had been accused of making fascist salutes at San Francisco Columbus Day celebrations, which he strongly denied. Rossi testified that he removed a picture of Benito Mussolini from his office before the war began.

Running for a fourth term as mayor in 1943, in a rancorous campaign, Rossi was defeated when a protégé of his, George Reilly, ran against him, splitting the Catholic vote, and when Roger Lapham was tapped by business interests to run, in part to advance their cause regarding the city&#x27;s purchase of the Market Street Railway.

He died in 1948 and is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, in Colma, California. A city park-playground-pool and a street in the Richmond district of San Francisco are named after him.

Foley&#x27;s district had become increasingly conservative during his tenure, but he won re-election throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In the 1994 election, Foley faced attorney George Nethercutt. Nethercutt mobilized popular anger over Foley&#x27;s opposition to term limits, which coincided with the Republican Revolution, leaving Foley as the highest-profile casualty. After leaving the House, Foley served as the United States Ambassador to Japan from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
Born and raised in Spokane, Washington, Foley was the son of Helen Marie (née Higgins), a school teacher, and Ralph E. Foley a Superior Court judge for 34 years. He was of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family; his grandfather Cornelius Foley was a maintenance foreman for the Great Northern railroad in 

Foley graduated from the Jesuit-run Gonzaga Preparatory School in Spokane in 1946 and attended Gonzaga University for three years; he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the University of Washington in Seattle, then attended its School of Law and was awarded a Juris Doctor degree in 1957.

Following law school, Foley entered private practice. In 1958, he began working in the Spokane County prosecutor&#x27;s office as a deputy prosecuting attorney, and later taught at Gonzaga&#x27;s School of Law (in Spokane) from 1958 to 1959. He joined the state attorney general&#x27;s office in 1961 as an assistant attorney general.

In 1961, Foley moved to Washington, D.C., and joined the staff of Senator Henry M. Jackson. He left Jackson&#x27;s office in 1964 to run for Congress.

==Congressional service==

In 1964, Foley was unopposed for the Democratic nomination for Washington&#x27;s 5th congressional seat, which included Spokane. He faced 11-term Republican incumbent Walt Horan in the general election and won by seven points, one of many swept into office in the 1964 Democratic landslide. He was re-elected without significant difficulty until 1978, when in a 3-person race, he won only 48% of the vote. Two years later, he narrowly defeated Republican candidate John Sonneland (52% to 48%). Though the fifth district became increasingly conservative, Foley didn&#x27;t face serious opposition again until his defeat in 1994. Foley voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto).

During his first term in the House, Foley was appointed to the Agriculture Committee and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. He served on the latter committee through 1975, when he became chairman of the Agriculture Committee. In 1981, when Foley was appointed Majority Whip, he left the Agriculture Committee to serve on the House Administration Committee. Six years later, January 1987, he was elected House Majority Leader.

===Speaker of the House===
In June 1989, Jim Wright of Texas resigned as Speaker of the House of Representatives (only the fourth speaker ever to resign) and from Congress amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into his personal business dealings. In the June 6 election to succeed Wright, Foley was the victor, receiving 251 votes; his Republican opponent, Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, received 164 votes.

During the 101st Congress, Foley presided over the House as it passed a landmark update to the 1963 Clean Air Act, measures protecting persons with disabilities, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as well as the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. The budget act, a part of the massive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, established the &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; process for discretionary spending and taxes, and was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on November 5, 1990, contrary to his 1988 campaign promise not to raise taxes. This became a significant issue during the 1992 presidential campaign.

In 1993, the 103rd Congress passed an omnibus budget bill through which the government was able to raise additional revenue and balance the federal budget. Signed into law by President Bill Clinton on August 10, 1993, the measure stirred controversy because of the tax increases it imposed. Under Foley&#x27;s leadership Congress also passed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, as well as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act plus legislation that laid the groundwork for the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; military service policy in 1993 which was then instituted by the Clinton Administration in 1994.

===Term limits===
During his time in the House, Foley repeatedly opposed efforts to impose term limits on Washington state&#x27;s elected officials, winning the support of the state&#x27;s voters to reject term limits in a 1991 referendum; however, in 1992, a term limit ballot initiative was approved by the state&#x27;s voters.

Foley brought suit, challenging the constitutionality of a state law setting eligibility requirements on federal offices. Foley won his suit, with a United States District Court declaring that states did not have the authority under the United States Constitution to limit the terms of federal officeholders.

However, in Foley&#x27;s bid for a 16th term in the House, his Republican opponent, George Nethercutt, used the issue against him, citing the caption of the federal case brought by Foley, &quot;Foley against the People of the State of Washington&quot;. Nethercutt vowed that if elected, he would not serve more than three terms in the House, though he ultimately served for five. Foley lost in a narrow race. While Foley had usually relied on large margins in Spokane to carry him to victory, in 1994 he won Spokane by only 9,000 votes, while Nethercutt did well enough in the rest of the district to win overall by just under 4,000 votes. Since Foley left office, no Democrat has garnered more than 45 percent of the district&#x27;s vote.

Foley became the first incumbent Speaker of the House to lose his bid for re-election since Galusha A. Grow in 1862. He is sometimes viewed as a political casualty of the term limits controversy of the early 1990s. President Clinton attributed Foley&#x27;s defeat to his support for the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.

==Later career==
From 1995 to 1998, Foley was head of the Federal City Council, a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C.

In 1997, Foley was appointed as the 25th U.S. Ambassador to Japan by President Bill Clinton, and was part of the US government response to the deaths of Japanese schoolchildren caused by a US submarine. 
He served as ambassador until 2001.

Foley was a Washington delegate to the 2004 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions. On July 9, 2003, Governor Gary Locke awarded the Washington Medal of Merit, the state&#x27;s highest honor, to Foley. He was North American Chairman of the Trilateral Commission.

==Death==
Foley died at his home in Washington, D.C. on October 18, 2013, following months of hospice care after suffering a series of strokes and a bout with pneumonia. He was 84 and was survived by his wife, Heather. Services were held at St. Aloysius Church at Gonzaga University, as well as in Washington, D.C. Speaker John Boehner, and Nancy Pelosi, who had also served as Speaker, issued statements honoring Foley. In a White House statement, President Barack Obama called Foley a &quot;legend of the United States Congress&quot; who &quot;represented the people of Washington&#x27;s 5th district with skill, dedication, and a deep commitment to improving the lives of those he was elected to serve.&quot;, going on to praise Foley for his bipartisanship and subsequent ambassadorial service under former President Clinton. Vice President Joe Biden also released an official statement, saying &quot;Tom was a good friend and a dedicated public servant.&quot;, citing his work in Congress with Foley in the 1980s on budgetary issues. Washington Governor Jay Inslee also released a statement, acknowledging Foley&#x27;s efforts to reach consensus and emphasize mutual common ground, and his work in the legal system and in Congress. Former President George H. W. Bush stated that Foley &quot;represented the very best in public service--and our political system&quot; and &quot;never got personal or burned bridges.&quot;

<text>Computerized system validation (CSV) (Computerised system validation in European countries, and usually referred to as &quot;Computer Systems Validation&quot;) is the process of testing/validating/qualifying a regulated (e.g., US FDA 21 CFR Part 11) computerized system to ensure that it does exactly what it is designed to do in a consistent and reproducible manner that is as safe, secure and reliable as paper-based records. This is widely used in the Pharmaceutical, Life Sciences and BioTech industries and is a cousin of Software Testing but with a more formal and documented approach. 
The validation process begins with validation planning, system requirements definition, testing and verification activities, and validation reporting. The system lifecycle then enters the operational phase and continues until system retirement and retention of system data based on regulatory rules.

Similarly, The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union, Volume 4, Annex 11: Computerised Systems applies to all forms of computerized systems used as part of a GMP regulated activities and defines Computer System Validation Elements 

==System requirement==
Documented system requirements are required for CSV as they clearly stipulate the intended use of a computer system application. System requirements are gathered and documented in the system definition phase. System definition artifacts that reflect these requirements can include, but are not limited to, the following:
* User Requirements Specification: Specifies required aims of the system. As opposed to specifying nice-to-have aims of the system.
* Hardware Requirements Specification: Minimum hardware required to support the system.

<text>159 Aemilia is a large main-belt asteroid. Aemilia was discovered by the French brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on January 26, 1876. The credit for this discovery was given to Paul. It is probably named after the Via Aemilia, a Roman road in Italy that runs from Piacenza to Rimini.

This slowly rotating, dark asteroid has a primitive carbonaceous composition, based upon its classification as a C-type asteroid. Photometric observations made in 2006 gave a rotation period of about 25 hours. Subsequent observations made at the Oakley Observatory in Terre Haute, Indiana found a light curve period of 16.37 ± 0.02 hours, with variation in brightness of 0.24 ± 0.04 in magnitude.

It orbits within the Hygiea family, although it may be an unrelated interloping asteroid, as it is too big to have arisen from the cratering process that most probably produced that family. Three stellar occultations by Aemilia have been recorded so far, the first in 2001, the second in 2003 and the third in 2016

<text>160 Una is a fairly large and dark, primitive Main belt asteroid that was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on February 20, 1876, in Clinton, New York. It is named after a character in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590). This minor planet is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with an eccentricity of 0.07. The orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 3.83° to the plane of the ecliptic.

In the Tholen classification system it is categorized as a CX-type, while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it as an Xk asteroid. Photometric observations of this asteroid made at the Torino Observatory in Italy during 1990–1991 were used to determine a synodic rotation period of 5.61 ± 0.01 hours. It has an estimated diameter of about .

<text>Richard Barrow Cadbury (29 August 1835 – 22 March 1899) was an English entrepreneur, chocolate-maker and philanthropist. He was the second son of the Quaker John Cadbury, founder of Cadbury&#x27;s cocoa and chocolate company.

== Career ==
Together with his younger brother George he took over the family business in 1861. Richard was the first to commercialise the connection between romance and confectionery with the company producing a heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1868. In 1878 they acquired 14 acres (57,000 m2) of land in open country, four miles (6 km) south of Birmingham where they opened a new factory in 1879. Over the following years, more land was acquired and a model village was built for his workers, which became known as Bournville.

He donated Moseley Hall to the City of Birmingham, for use as a children&#x27;s convalescent home.

== Death ==
Having fallen ill with diphtheria during a trip to the Khedivate of Egypt, Cadbury was taken for treatment to the hospital of the Church&#x27;s Ministry Among Jewish People in the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, but succumbed to his illness on 22 March 1899, aged 63 At that time, he and his brother George owned 100% of the ordinary shares in their business.

== Aftermath ==
In 1905 the executors of Cadbury&#x27;s estate distributed £40,000 to various charities including £10,000 to the Temperance Hospital in London.

His wife Emma died in 1907 after falling down some stairs while at sea on the &quot;Empress of India&quot;. His daughter Beatrice Boeke-Cadbury worked as an educational reformer and, for her work saving Jewish children during the Holocaust, was posthumously honoured as one of the Righteous Among the Nations.

<text>The Madrid Royal Conservatory () is a music college in Madrid, Spain.

==History==
The Royal Conservatory of Music was founded on July 15, 1830, by royal decree, and was originally located in Mostenses Square, Madrid. In 1852 it was moved to the Royal Opera, where it remained until the building was condemned by royal order and classes ordered to halt in 1925. For the next sixty-five years, the school had no fixed home, operating in a variety of locations. Since 1990, the Conservatory has officially lived in a restored 18th-century building (previously &quot;San Carlos&quot; Royal Hospital) in front of Queen Sofia Museum.

<text>161 Athor is an M-type Main belt asteroid that was discovered by James Craig Watson on April 19, 1876, at the Detroit Observatory and named after Hathor, an Egyptian fertility goddess. It is the namesake of a proposed Athor asteroid family, estimated to be ~3 billion years old.

Photometric observations of the minor planet in 2010 gave a rotation period of with an amplitude of in magnitude. This result is consistent with previous determinations. An occultation by Athor was observed, on October 15, 2002, showing an estimated diameter of . The spectra is similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites, with characteristics of ferric oxides and little or no hydrated minerals.

<text>Descanso Gardens is a botanical garden located in La Cañada Flintridge, Los Angeles County, California. It sits on the northern edge of the San Rafael Hills.

Descanso Gardens features a wide area, mostly forested, with artificial streams, ponds, and lawns. Descanso Gardens has a wide collection of fruit trees, including orange, peach, pear, pomegranate, crabapple, fruits of the genus prunus, grapes, and passionfruit. Descanso Gardens is often referred to as simply &quot;Descanso&quot; by locals and consistent patrons. 

==History==
The first Spanish governor of California deeded this land as part of a vast 36,000-acre rancho to Corporal José María Verdugo in 1784 for his loyal service. The property remained in the Verdugo family until 1869.

In 1937, the property was purchased by E. Manchester Boddy, owner of &quot;The Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News&quot;, and managed as a working ranch, which he called Rancho del Descanso. He built a two-story mansion of 22 rooms, designed by Beverly Hills architect James E. Dolena. He also purchased more than 400 acres north of the original property, the source of mountain streams that provide water for Descanso Gardens today. In 1942, when people of Japanese ancestry were forced into internment camps following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Boddy purchased up to 100,000 camellia plants from two Japanese-owned nurseries in the San Gabriel Valley run by his friends, the Uyematsu and Yoshimura families. He built his camellia collection – and later his rose and lilac collections – assisted by horticulturist J. Howard Asper and hybridizer Dr. Walter E. Lammerts.

In 1953, Boddy sold this property to Los Angeles County and moved to San Diego County. Four years later, local volunteers formed the Descanso Gardens Guild, Inc. Now a 501(c) organization, the Guild today manages all garden operations in a public/private partnership with Los Angeles County. The gardens were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2021.

In 1995, the gardens were featured in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; Episode 310.

Descanso Gardens homes many different animal species native to the area. The species native to La Canada Flintridge include deer, mountain lions, birds, snakes, and squirrels. Many of these animals feed on the plants in the gardens as well as live in the plant life.
==Boddy House==
The Boddy House is the original 22-room mansion built by E. Manchester Boddy and designed by James Dolena in the Hollywood Regency style in 1937. The house is located in the far southeast corner of the property, overlooking the San Gabriel Mountains.

In 2007, the Boddy House was rehabilitated for the 43rd annual Pasadena Showcase House of Design, and decorated in a contemporary re-interpretation of its original Hollywood Regency style. Subsequently, a major grant from the Ahmanson Foundation enabled the addition of a museum-quality Heritage Exhibit, with exhibits about the gardens, Manchester Boddy&#x27;s life and times, and important donors and volunteers for the Descanso Gardens. Executive Director David Brown led the 2007 rehabilitation of the Boddy House; he planned to retire in 2017 after 12 years leading the botanic gardens. In 2019, the Boddy House was once again reimagined by Showcase House designers.

==Sturt Haaga Gallery==

The Sturt Haaga Gallery opened in the autumn of 2011. The gallery is named for the initial gift of $2.1 million from Heather Sturt Haaga and Paul G. Haaga Jr. Other donations followed, also from private entities.

Boddy&#x27;s original garage was restored and houses two galleries. The facility was enhanced by the addition of a contemporary structure which doubled the size for exhibitions and with its ceilings allowed larger single pieces of art, completing the rehabilitation of site buildings begun in 2007. The contemporary structure was designed by the architects Frederick Fisher &amp; Partners and completed in 2011.

The Gallery presents three exhibitions per year. The focus is on work by contemporary artists that portrays themes and subjects relevant to its setting in the Descanso Gardens. The first exhibit of 2014 included works by over 150 contemporary artists, some entered in a jury competition, others commissioned by the Gardens. The exhibition involved contemporary photographs of the Descanso Gardens in a video gallery, using the hashtag #Portraitsofthegarden to collect the photos from social media web sites Twitter and Instagram.

In the first half of 2023 the Sturt Haaga Gallery is showing the exhibit SHIKI: The Four Seasons in Japanese Art. The exhibit is from Scripps College collection. The collection includes Kimonos and paintings that display the four seasons.

<text>162 Laurentia is a large and dark main-belt asteroid that was discovered by the French brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on 21 April 1876, and named after Joseph Jean Pierre Laurent, an amateur astronomer who discovered asteroid 51 Nemausa.

An occultation by Laurentia was observed from Clive, Alberta on 21 November 1999.

Photometric observations of this asteroid from multiple observatories during 2007 gave a light curve with a period of 11.8686 ± 0.0004 hours and a brightness variation of 0.40 ± 0.05 in magnitude. This is in agreement with previous studies in 1994 and 2007.

<text>The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, known by its initials BVM, is a Roman Catholic religious institute founded in the United States by Mother Mary Frances Clarke. Its founders were Irish Catholics. The BVM currently works in twenty-five U.S. states and three foreign countries.

==Early history==

In 1831, four Franciscan Tertiaries women in Dublin rented a small cottage and began an experiment in community living. Soon, the original four - Mary Frances Clarke, Margaret Mann, Rose O’Toole, and Eliza Kelly - were joined by another, Catherine Byrne. 

Together, in March 1832, these five opened a school, Miss Clarke’s Seminary, for young girls on North Anne Street in Dublin. In 1833, they met Patrick Costello, a Catholic priest from Philadelphia. From him the five learned about the plight of the Irish Catholic immigrants in America. After prayerful consideration and Fr. Costello&#x27;s agreement to make arrangements for their arrival in the US, the fellowship of women, except for O&#x27;Toole (who remained in Dublin long enough to settle a family estate) decided to leave their homeland to teach in Philadelphia. They arrived in New York in September, 1833.

During the voyage, the women had entrusted their money to Kelly. As she was climbing down a rope ladder to depart the ship, the purse containing the money accidentally fell into the harbor. In a further setback, the women discovered that Fr. Costello had not prepared for their arrival, and was nowhere to be found. When they finally arrived in Philadelphia, they were taken in by Margaret McDonough, who found them lodging, and directed them to a young priest. 

Ms McDonough directed the group to Fr. Terence James Donaghoe, who had just been named pastor of the yet-to-be-built parish of St. Michael’s. After meeting the women, Fr. Donaghoe invited them to teach in his parish school, as soon as it was completed. In the interim, the women decided to open a school of their own, which they named Sacred Heart. 

The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was officially founded on November 1, 1833. The group made an act of consecration as the Sisters of the Blessed Virgin. In this act, the band of women took one more step in becoming a formal community of women religious sisters within the Roman Catholic tradition. Fr. Donaghoe drafted a rule for the small community and subsequently became father director, while Clarke was named mother superior. For the next ten years, the sisters continued to teach as well as gain new members.

==Iowa Territory==

In 1843, Bishop Mathias Loras of the Diocese of Dubuque, Iowa, who had been visiting Philadelphia, invited the sisters to come teach in the Iowa Territory. The pioneer BVMs, by then nineteen in number, moved to Dubuque, Iowa, and began to teach the children of settlers, lead miners, and farmers. They opened a boarding school, St. Mary’s Academy, which was the predecessor of the St. Raphael Cathedral school. They were the first women religious in the territory and would soon open many additional schools.

During their first years in Iowa, the building was used for another school, Sacred Heart. In 1859, the building again saw new life when the St. Joseph Prairie boarding school moved to the site. In 1867 Jesuit priest Arnold Damen invited the sisters to open a school at Holy Family in Chicago. The BVMs opened a number of schools throughout the city, including St. Mary’s and Immaculata High Schools.

In 1885, the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, formerly a diocesan community, became a pontifical congregation.
==Continued growth==

Since the beginning, education had been the dominant charism of the BVM community. This continued as the sisterhood grew. Over the next several decades, community leaders directed significant resources on improving the education of the sisters, who were responsible for teaching a large number of students. 

During the twentieth century, the BVM community continued to grow in both size and number of missions. In the early 1900s, the superior sent teaching sisters to summer school programs at DePaul, Marquette, and the Catholic University of America, as well as to special institutes run at St. Mary’s, one of the community run high schools in Chicago. This ongoing education was especially important for those sisters who taught at Mt. St. Joseph; in 1901 the school received permission to begin granting three-year college degrees.

To honor Mary Frances Clarke, the name of Mt. St. Joseph College was changed to Clarke College in 1928. The following year, construction began for another college, Mundelein College in Chicago. This school remained open until 1991, when it became part of Loyola University. During this time, the community continued to focus on the education of both the students, and the teaching sisters. 

1937 saw the opening of a school in Memphis at which the sisters began working directly with the African American community. A few years later, in 1945 a small group of sisters opened a school in Hawaii, and by 1961 there were sisters serving in Latin America. With sisters serving in so many locations, the community developed into a well-networked educational system that spanned the country, from New York to California, and beyond.

In 1849 there was a fire at St. Joseph Prairie; there was a 1955 fire at the infirmary at the Dubuque motherhouse, a 1958 fire at Our Lady of the Angels (a BVM grammar school in Chicago), and a 1984 fire at Clarke College.

Previously the habit had a distinct cover in the shape of a horseshoe. The habit changed in 1959.

==New era==

1961 marked the beginning of a new era in the community and the construction of one of the last remaining BVM high schools. Carmel High School in Mundelein, Illinois was a joint project with the Carmelite Fathers. 

In 1967, the Tenth General Chapter sought to respond to the invitations of the Second Vatican Council. The BVMs responded to the Council’s call to renewal. Their mission and ministry expanded around the globe and beyond the traditional field of education to include health care, pastoral services, and social justice. Activities which followed included legislation approving a new government structure, the Totally Open Personal Application (TOPA), which gave sisters the freedom to apply for jobs of their choice, and an affiliate program, which consisted of an organized grouping of non-vowed men and women interested in participating in the BVM values. 1968 saw the closing of the last boarding school.

The congregation celebrated its 190th Anniversary on Nov. 1, 2023. At that time, there were more than 200 sisters with an average age of 85 years.

==Social action==
The community has been actively involved in working for peace with justice. During the Civil Rights Movement, sisters participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. A number of sisters participated in the annual demonstration at the School of the Americas/Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation each year. Sisters of Charity are on the staff of NETWORK and the 8th Day Center for Justice, a coalition of Catholic religious congregations striving for social change. BVM sisters and their associates collaborate with other women religious and advocacy organizations on issues such as immigration reform, human trafficking, opposition to the death penalty, and nonviolence, especially for women and children. The congregation has also taken a corporate stance against the death penalty, has declared that the Mount Carmel campus in Dubuque is a nuclear-free zone, and supports national comprehensive immigration reform.

Currently the congregation has sisters living in nineteen states, and in three foreign countries: Ghana, Ecuador, and Guatemala. Ministries of the sisters include working as chaplains in hospitals, hospices and prisons, working with those with addictions or AIDS, pastoral service, spiritual direction, counseling and education.

<text>163 Erigone is an asteroid from the asteroid belt and the namesake of the Erigone family of asteroids that share similar orbital elements and properties. It was discovered by French astronomer Henri Joseph Perrotin on April 26, 1876, and named after one of the two Erigones in Greek mythology. This asteroid is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with a period of and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.19. The orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 4.8° to the plane of the ecliptic.

Photometric measurements taken in 2014 were used to construct a lightcurve that demonstrated a rotation period of with an amplitude of in magnitude. Erigone is a relatively large and dark asteroid with an estimated size of 73 km. Based upon its spectrum, it is classified as a C-type asteroid, which indicates that it probably has a carbonaceous composition. It is the largest member of the eponymously named Erigone collisional family.

==2014 occultation of Regulus==
In the early morning hours of March 20, 2014, Erigone occulted the first-magnitude star Regulus, as first predicted by Aldo Vitagliano in 2004 using the SOLEX software. This would have been a rare case of an occultation of a very bright star visible from a highly populated area, since the shadow path moved across New York state and Ontario, including all five boroughs of New York City. Observers in the shadow path would have seen the star wink out for as long as 14 seconds.

However, thick clouds and rain blocked the view for most if not all people on the shadow path. The website of the International Occultation Timing Association does not list any successful observations at all.

Two single chord Asteroid Occultation events have been observed, in 2013 and 2015.

<text>Mercury-Atlas 4 (MA-4) was an uncrewed test flight within NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury program, launched on September 13, 1961, at 14:04:16 UTC from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14. The mission&#x27;s primary purpose was to evaluate the Mercury spacecraft&#x27;s performance in orbit and to test the Mercury Space Flight Network. Despite initial technical challenges, Mercury-Atlas 4 successfully met its goals. The mission involved testing the Mercury spacecraft, specifically Mercury #8A, which completed one orbit around Earth. This successful flight provided important data and insights for NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury, supporting the planning and development of upcoming crewed missions in the program.

==Mission overview==
===Launch preparations===
There were a series of delays getting the Atlas rocket and Mercury spacecraft ready as the postflight findings from Mercury-Atlas 3 had necessitated extensive modifications to the booster. Atlas vehicle 88D did not undergo its factory rollout inspection until June 30 and delivery to Cape Canaveral waited until July 15. Moreover, the flight was not going to use Mercury capsule #9 as planned, but instead capsule #8A, which had been recovered from the Mercury-Atlas 3 launch and refurbished. Capsule #8A was also the last of the older models with small port windows, no landing bag, and a heavy locking mechanism on the hatch.

A series of delays occurred due to problems with the Atlas autopilot, including the replacement of a defective yaw rate gyro. Launch was originally intended for August 22 but pushed back. Further delays happened when it was discovered that the brand of transistor used in both the Atlas and Mercury were prone to forming solder balls, thus the entire last week of August was spent laboriously repairing them.

===Mission profile===

This flight was an orbital test of the Mercury Space Flight Network and the first successful orbital flight test of Project Mercury; all previous successful launches were suborbital. The payload consisted of a pilot simulator (to test the environmental controls), two voice tapes (to check the tracking network), a life support system, three cameras, and instrumentation to monitor levels of noise, vibration and radiation. Because it was suspected that a transient voltage caused the malfunction of Mercury-Atlas 3&#x27;s programmer (and that a similar problem had been responsible for Big Joe&#x27;s failure to stage), Convair equipped the autopilot to give the engines a counteracting capability. Thus, testing this was also an objective of the flight. Also, the Atlas vehicle used to launch MIDAS 3 in July had experienced a programmer reset at staging, which did not have any significant effect or prevent the satellite from reaching orbit, but this incident was thoroughly investigated because of the problems with Mercury-Atlas 3; one modification to Mercury vehicles would involve removing the programmer&#x27;s ability to reset itself in flight.

Of continuing concern were rough combustion and gyroscope malfunctions as these failure modes had destroyed two Atlas E vehicles in June. The Spin Motor Rotation Detection System, invented to prevent an Atlas from launching with an improperly operating gyroscope, was just being phased in and would not appear in a Mercury vehicle until Mercury-Atlas 5.

===Mission highlights===
The launch went well and the thick-skinned Atlas survived Max Q acceleration. Capsule performance was also good despite some concern over high oxygen usage in orbit, but ground controllers did not consider it a serious problem and the oxygen supply was sufficient for at least 8 orbits. The process of turning the capsule around in orbit so its heat shield faced forward proved more difficult than expected, taking 50 seconds instead of the normal 20 seconds. At a few points during the mission, the capsule&#x27;s attitude became slightly unstable due to the failure of two thrusters, which caused momentary telemetry dropouts. The capsule completed one orbit prior to returning to Earth. Reentry took place one hour and 28 minutes after launch, and splashdown occurred in the Atlantic Ocean 176 miles (283 kilometers) east of Bermuda. One hour and 22 minutes after splashdown the destroyer (which was 34 miles from the landing point) picked up the capsule, which was found to be in good condition with little damage from either liftoff, orbit, or reentry. Postflight examination found that the oxygen rate handle had been dislodged by liftoff-induced vibration and cracked open a valve. This had allowed oxygen to escape into space, but not at sufficient rates to trigger a telemetry warning measurement, although it did trigger the oxygen warning light in the capsule. The handle was redesigned afterwards to be more difficult to move. The problem reorienting the capsule after booster separation was found to be the result of an open circuit in the pitch gyro.

The biggest problem encountered on Mercury-Atlas 4 was an uncomfortably high level of liftoff vibration from T+5 to T+20 seconds, so a few more small modifications were made to the Atlas&#x27;s autopilot. However, Manned Spaceflight Center director Bob Gilruth expressed his confidence that the booster was now man-rated, and that a human passenger would have survived the flight. 

The MA-4 mission had successfully achieved all its flight objectives. It had demonstrated the ability of the Atlas LV-3B rocket to lift the Mercury capsule into orbit and of the capsule and its systems to operate completely autonomously, and it had succeeded in obtaining pictures of the Earth. Nonetheless, to be on the safe side and test out a few more design changes, NASA still planned for one more uncrewed test before committing the Mercury-Atlas combo to a crewed flight.

<text>Douglas Donald Davidson (born October 24, 1954) is an American television actor. He has portrayed Paul Williams on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; from 1978 to 2020, making him one of the soaps&#x27; longest-serving cast members.

==Career==
Davidson appeared as captain of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; team when they played for charity on &quot;Family Feud&quot; several times from 1989 until 1995. Through connections he made during those appearances, Davidson eventually got a position hosting a five-night-a-week, syndicated, half-hour version of the game show &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot;, beginning on September 12, 1994. The show was canceled just four and a half months later on January 27, 1995. Davidson was one of a few people given an audition to replace Bob Barker after his retirement from &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; on June 15, 2007, a role which ultimately went to Drew Carey. Davidson has also hosted the live stage show adaptation, &quot;The Price Is Right Live!&quot;, at Harrah&#x27;s-owned casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada.Davidson appeared in the 1996 pilot of the classic game show &quot;Card Sharks&quot; hosted by Tom Green (not to be confused with the formerly popular MTV personality of the same name) as a video clip in the bonus round.

From 1998 through 2003, Davidson served as a host of the annual &quot;Tournament of Roses Parade&quot;.

On September 12, 2018, it was reported that Davidson&#x27;s contract was not renewed. Davidson confirmed that he was &quot;not included&quot; in the new direction for &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. In a turnaround following the departure of executive producer and head writer Mal Young, CBS announced on February 19, 2019 that Davidson would be returning to the role.

==Personal life==

He has been married to actress Cindy Fisher since 1984. They have two children, daughter Calyssa and son Caden.

<doc id="747039" wikidata="Q1536303" url="?curid=747039" title="Harlock Saga">
<text>is a manga series written and illustrated by Leiji Matsumoto. An adaptation of Wilhelm Richard Wagner epic music drama &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, it tells the story of space pirate Captain Harlock and his crew as they try to stop a man who has stolen gold from the center of the galaxy and forged it into a powerful ring. It was adapted into a six-part original video animation series titled .

== Overview of the manga ==
The &quot;Harlock Saga&quot; manga, like many of Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s works, remains unfinished. Eight volumes were published (both in Japanese by Shinchosha and in French by Kana Press), with the last two of a planned three available online in English. The first series, Rheingold (2 volumes), was the basis for the &quot;Harlock Saga&quot; OVA series.

Walküre (3 volumes) is the second of a two-part story dealing largely with the events surrounding the epic voyage and subsequent death of Francis &quot;Great&quot; Harlock, Captain Harlock&#x27;s father, in 2964 AD. The story begins immediately after the events depicted in &quot;Rheingold&quot;. Wotan, lord of the gods of Valhalla, is furious over Captain Harlock&#x27;s earlier appearance in Valhalla and his insolence toward himself as lord of the gods. Wotan does not care that Harlock has just gotten through saving Valhalla (and Wotan&#x27;s hide); he wishes the whole affair had never happened. To that end he orders his daughter Brunhilde and her cohorts, the legendary Valkyries, on a journey back through time with orders to kill Harlock while he is still a youth. In order to accomplish her mission Brunhilde must cross swords with Great Harlock, the father of the boy she has been sent back in time to kill. The both of them must also deal with the Metanoids (who make their first appearance here in a Matsumoto story), who have designs of their own for the universe that do not take into account the gods of Valhalla. Caught up in this storm of events are four singular young people. First is young Harlock (or &quot;Little Harlock&quot; as his father calls him), a teenager who has a great destiny ahead of him but must first live long enough to achieve it. Second is young Tochiro Oyama, young Harlock&#x27;s best friend and the spitting image of his famous father Dr. Oyama in looks, personality, and intelligence. Third is young Emeraldas, who along with her younger sister Maetel have chanced upon an ancient starship of great power on the planet Metabloody that awaits &quot;...its rightful master&quot;. Fourth is young Maetel herself, mysterious even as a child, who seems strangely attracted to young Harlock and correctly senses that the destinies of all four of them are bound together by the strands of time upon the eternal Sea of Stars.

Siegfried (3 volumes) is the third of a two-part story dealing with the adventures of Great Harlock. It is also set in the year 2964 AD and covers the events leading up to the death of Great Harlock. The Metanoids are planning to conquer the known universe and have built a fleet of sophisticated warships, the likes of which have never been seen before. All that stands between them and their goal is an unlikely alliance of mortal and immortal: Great Harlock, the legendary space pirate, who sails the Sea of Stars in the second incarnation of his space battleship Death Shadow; and Brunhilde the Valkyrie, shieldmaiden of Valhalla, who has defied her father&#x27;s orders to kill Great Harlock&#x27;s son and joined forces with him under the flag of freedom, the skull-and-crossbones of old. Witnessing this great (and tragic) event unfold are Miime the Nibelung sorceress and four youths who as adults are destined to shape the future of the universe. The manner in which Great Harlock and Brunhilde face the impending threat of the Metanoids, one that will certainly result in both of their deaths, will make a lasting impression on the young lives who must deal with their willing sacrifice.

Götterdämmerung (no volumes, on hiatus) picks up the story almost a decade after the death of Great Harlock. Miime, now serving Captain Harlock aboard the mighty space battleship Arcadia, has just finished telling him the full story behind the death of his father. Now that he understands the extent of Wotan&#x27;s involvement in the affair Captain Harlock is aroused to wrath. Together with his ally Emeraldas he dares to defy Wotan once again and challenge Valhalla&#x27;s rule over the universe. His actions have been foreseen by Erda the soothsayer, who had earlier predicted that Wotan&#x27;s attempt to change Harlock&#x27;s past would result in the Twilight of the Gods and the end of Valhalla. Now that prophecy is coming true, and even as Captain Harlock finishes resolving the legacy of his late father, cosmic forces array themselves for a final showdown at the center of the universe. For some, it will almost certainly mean the end of all things; for others, perhaps, a beginning.

== Overview of the anime ==
Legend tells of the Rheingold, an all-powerful metal used by the gods of Valhalla during the forging of the universe. Legend says that the one who wields the Rheingold wields ultimate power over all things. The Nibelheim, former servants of Valhalla who were cast down aeons ago for daring to defy the gods, are once again fomenting a rebellion. Their leader Alberich is on a ruthless quest for the Rheingold and will let nothing stand in the way of his desire to utterly crush Wotan and the gods of Valhalla. Fearing the implications of his actions, his sister Miime, currently in the service of the space pirate Captain Harlock, warns her friend about Alberich&#x27;s plans. Together with fellow space pirate Emeraldas, his best friend Tochiro Oyama, and Maetel the eternal traveler, Captain Harlock sets out to thwart Alberich&#x27;s designs and save the universe - not for the gods, but for all the living beings it contains.

<text>Raymond Geuss, FBA (; born 1946) is an American political philosopher and scholar of 19th and 20th century European philosophy. He is currently Emeritus Professor in the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Cambridge. Geuss is primarily known for three reasons: his early account of ideology critique in &quot;The Idea of a Critical Theory&quot;; a recent collection of works instrumental to the emergence of political realism in Anglophone political philosophy over the last decade, including &quot;Philosophy and Real Politics&quot;; and a variety of free-standing essays on issues including aesthetics, Nietzsche, contextualism, phenomenology, intellectual history, culture and ancient philosophy.

==Life==
Geuss was educated at Columbia University (undergraduate B.A., &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, 1966, and Ph.D., 1971). His Ph.D. thesis was written under the direction of Robert Denoon Cumming. Geuss was also greatly influenced by Sidney Morgenbesser during his university education.

Geuss taught at Princeton University, Columbia University, and University of Chicago in the United States, and at Heidelberg and Freiburg in Germany before taking up a lecturing post at Cambridge in 1993. In 2000 he became a naturalised British citizen. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2011.

Geuss has supervised the graduate work of several prominent scholars working in the history of continental philosophy, social and political philosophy and in the philosophy of art. His students include former Southern Poverty Law Center president J. Richard Cohen, filmmaker Ethan Coen and Cornel West.

==Work==
To date, Geuss has published 16 books of philosophy, of which four are collections of essays. They are: &quot;The Idea of a Critical Theory: Habermas and the Frankfurt School&quot;; &quot;Morality, Culture, and History&quot;; &quot;Public Goods, Private Goods&quot;; &quot;History and Illusion in Politics&quot;; &quot;Glück und Politik&quot;; &quot;Outside Ethics&quot;, &quot;Philosophy and Real Politics,&quot; &quot;Politics and the Imagination,&quot; &quot;A World without Why&quot;, &quot;Reality and its Dreams&quot;, &quot;Changing the Subject: Philosophy from Socrates to Adorno&quot;, &quot;Who Needs a World View?, Not Thinking like a Liberal,&quot; and &quot;A Philosopher looks at Work&quot;. He has also co-edited two critical editions of works of Nietzsche, &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Writings from the Early Notebooks.&quot; Geuss has also published two collections of translations/adaptations of poetry from Ancient Greek, Latin and Old High German texts.

==Reception==
Alasdair MacIntyre has written the following about Geuss:No one among contemporary moral and political philosophers writes better essays than Raymond Geuss. His prose is crisp, elegant, and lucid. His arguments are to the point. And, by inviting us to reconsider what we have hitherto taken for granted, he puts in question not just this or that particular philosophical thesis, but some of the larger projects in which we are engaged. Often enough Geuss does this with remarkable economy, provoking us into first making his questions our own and then discovering how difficult it is to answer them.

<text>164 Eva is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by the French brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on July 12, 1876, in Paris. The reason the name Eva was chosen remains unknown, though Karl Ludwig Littrow suspected a &quot;worldly origin&quot; (&quot;Mit dem Namen könnten wir wie bei Miriam wieder den biblischen Boden zu betreten glauben, wenn wir bei diesem Entdecker nicht an Taufen weltlichen Ursprungs gewöhnt wären&quot;). The orbital elements for 164 Eva were published in 1877 by American astronomer Winslow Upton. It is categorized as a C-type asteroid and is probably composed of primitive carbonaceous chondritic materials.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado, during 2008 gave a light curve with a period of 13.672 ± 0.003 hours and a small brightness variation of 0.04 ± 0.01 in magnitude. This is consistent with a previous study reported in 1982 that listed a period estimate of 13.66 hours.

Between 2000 and 2021, 164 Eva has been observed to occult fourteen stars.

With a perihelion of 1.718 AU 164 Eva is the closest asteroid over 100 kilometers to approach the orbit of Mars. Its closest approach is about 0.05 AU or about 19.5 lunar distances.

<doc id="747050" wikidata="Q156128" url="?curid=747050" title="Georges Rouault">
<text>Georges-Henri Rouault (; 27 May 1871, Paris - 13 February 1958, Paris) was a French painter, draughtsman, and printmaker, whose work is often associated with Fauvism and Expressionism.

==Childhood and education==
Rouault was born into a poor family in Paris. He was born in a Parisian cellar after his family&#x27;s home was destroyed in the Paris insurrection of 1871. His mother encouraged his love for the arts, and, in 1885, the fourteen-year-old Rouault embarked on an apprenticeship as a glass painter and restorer, which lasted until 1890. This early experience as a glass painter has been suggested as a likely source of the heavy black contouring and glowing colors, likened to leaded glass, which characterize Rouault&#x27;s mature painting style. During his apprenticeship, he also attended evening classes at the School of Fine Arts, and in 1891, he entered the École des Beaux-Arts, the official art school of France. There he studied under Gustave Moreau and became his favorite student. Rouault&#x27;s earliest works show a symbolism in the use of color that probably reflects Moreau&#x27;s influence, and when Moreau died in 1898, Rouault was nominated as the curator of the Moreau Museum in Paris.

== Personal Life ==
Roualt became a devout Roman Catholic following an emotional breakdown in 1895 or after.

==Early works ==
In 1891 Rouault painted &quot;The Way to Calvary&quot;. In 1894, Rouault won the Prix Chenavard. From 1895 on, he took part in major public exhibitions, notably the Salon d&#x27;Automne (which he helped to found), where paintings with religious subjects, landscapes, and still lifes were shown. 
Rouault met Henri Matisse, Albert Marquet, Henri Manguin, and Charles Camoin. These friendships brought him to the movement of Fauvism, the leader of which was considered to be Matisse. In 1905, he exhibited his paintings at the Salon d&#x27;Automne with the other Fauvists. While Matisse represented the reflective and rationalized aspects of the group, Rouault embodied a more spontaneous and instinctive style.

His use of stark contrasts and emotionality is credited to the influence of Vincent van Gogh. His characterizations of overemphasized grotesque personalities inspired the expressionist painters.

==Expressionist works==
In 1907, Rouault commenced a series of paintings dedicated to courts, clowns, and prostitutes. These paintings are interpreted as moral and social criticism. He became attracted to Spiritualism and the dramatic existentialism of the philosopher Jacques Maritain, who remained a close friend for the rest of his life. After that, he dedicated himself to religious subjects. Human nature was always the focus of his interest. Rouault said: &quot;A tree against the sky possesses the same interest, the same character, the same expression as the figure of a human.&quot;

In 1910, Rouault had his first works exhibited in the Druet Gallery. His works were studied by German artists from Dresden, who later formed the nucleus of expressionism.

From 1917, Rouault dedicated himself to painting. The Christian faith informed his work in his search for inspiration and marks him out as perhaps the most passionate Christian artist of the 20th century: first of all, in the theme of the passion of Christ. The face of Jesus and the cries of the women at the feet of the cross are symbols of the pain of the world, which for Rouault was relieved by belief in resurrection.

In 1929, Rouault created the designs for Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, with music by Sergei Prokofiev and choreography by George Balanchine.

In 1930, he also began to exhibit in foreign countries, mainly in London, New York, and Chicago.

In 1937. Rouault painted &quot;The Old King&quot;, which is arguably his finest expressionist work.

In 1939. Rouault advised French art dealer Paul Rosenberg on several purchases. One of them is a Christ flagellé shown at the Van Leer Family&#x27;s house.

He exhibited his cycle &quot;Miserere&quot; in 1948.

At the end of his life, he burned 300 of his pictures (estimated to be worth today about more than half a billion francs). His reason for doing this was not profound, as he simply felt he would not live to finish them.

Rouault died in Paris on 13 February 1958, at the age of 86.

<text>William Roughead (pronounced &quot;Ruff-head&quot;) (1870–1952) was a Scottish lawyer and amateur criminologist, as well as an editor and essayist on &quot;matters criminous&quot;. He was an important early practitioner of the modern &quot;true crime&quot; literary genre.

==Biography==
===Career===
Roughead held the title of Writer to Her Majesty&#x27;s Signet as a Scottish solicitor. As the years progressed, Roughead practised law less and increasingly plied a trade as an unofficial historian of crime. He marks this transition from the year 1889, when at the age of nineteen, he skipped his apprentice work at the law firm of Maclaren and Traquair to attend the trial of Jessie King, the murderous baby-farmer of Stockbridge (an experience he described in his essay &quot;My First Murder: Featuring Jessie King&quot;, &quot;In Queer Street&quot;, 1932). For roughly the next six decades, Roughead attended almost every murder trial of any importance at the High Court of Justiciary. These experiences provided the material he would submit for publication in the &quot;Juridical Review&quot;, a monthly Scottish legal journal; in later years, he would collect his contributions to the &quot;Juridical Review&quot; as well as much new material into several anthologies of essays.

His first collection was published in 1913 under the title &quot;Twelve Scots Trials&quot;, containing a dozen &quot;adventures in criminal biography&quot;. The collection included among its twelve cases two notable trials, that of Katharine Nairn and John Watson Laurie, which Roughead was to revisit in more detail later in his career. The title of his first collection apparently was a mild disappointment to Roughead, stating in his &quot;Personal Preface&quot; to his third collection, &quot;Glengarry&#x27;s Way and Other Studies&quot;, that &quot;...I have always considered that my venture suffered in its baptism...of those three fateful words two at least were unhappily chosen. &#x27;Scots&#x27; tended to arouse hereditary prejudice...&#x27;Trials&#x27; suggested to the lay mind either the bloomless technicalities of law reports or the raw and ribald obscenities of the baser press.&quot; He ended his lament upon his title with characteristic humour, &quot;Had they been a &#x27;baker&#x27;s dozen&#x27; the game would have been up indeed.&quot;

Following the tangled web of the publication of those essays can present a real challenge to Roughead&#x27;s readers. His early collections, published by William Hodge of Edinburgh, follow a more direct path, from appearing in the &quot;Juridical Review&quot; to being collected in anthologies, often titled with the leading essay. When he began to have a wider audience in the United States, his studies in crime were printed and reprinted in a series of overlapping anthologies, generally titled on variants of the word &quot;murder&quot;: &quot;Mainly Murder&quot;, &quot;The Enjoyment of Murder&quot;, &quot;Murder and More Murder&quot;, &quot;The Murderer&#x27;s Companion&quot;, &quot;The Art of Murder&quot; and &quot;Nothing But Murder&quot;. The American public eagerly embraced Roughead&#x27;s dry humour as well as his fascination with criminals who looked and sounded exactly like us but who inhabited a parallel dark and rarefied nether world. This was a reading audience who were being introduced to the masters of hard-boiled pulp fiction, authors who, as Raymond Chandler said, were &quot;...giving murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse.&quot; As Alexander Woolcott noted, in an introduction to a Reader&#x27;s Club edition of Roughead, even US President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a special shelf just outside the Oval Office, labelled &quot;The President&#x27;s Shelf&quot;, with the &quot;rarest of brews&quot; being Roosevelt&#x27;s personal selection of Roughead.

Roughead was also one of many editors of a series of trial accounts called &quot;Notable Scottish Trials&quot;, also published by William Hodge and Company. His first contribution to the Scottish trial series was the trial of Dr. Pritchard, the notorious Glasgow poisoner. He was later to contribute another nine trial accounts, including some of the more notorious criminal cases of old and new Edinburgh.

In the early twenties, Roughead began a correspondence with American crime writer, Edmund Pearson, and a professional exchange of letters blossomed into a warm friendship for the next fifteen years. When Pearson published his landmark &quot;Studies in Murder&quot; in 1924, Roughead&#x27;s praise for the work was enthusiastic, especially for Pearson&#x27;s treatment of America&#x27;s most famous murderess, Lizzie Borden of Fall River. In a letter to Pearson, Roughead said, &quot;...honestly, I never enjoyed a case more than Miss Lizzie&#x27;s. It is as unique as it is perfect: a flawless work of art...&quot;

==Assessment==
According to Joyce Carol Oates: &quot;Roughead&#x27;s influence was enormous, and since his time &quot;true crime&quot; has become a crowded, flourishing field, though few writers of distinction have been drawn to it... Roughead, much admired by Henry James, wrote in a style that combined intelligence, witty scepticism, and a flair for old-fashioned storytelling and moralising; his accounts of murder cases and trials have the advantage of being concise and pointed, like folk tales.&quot;
Perhaps Roughead&#x27;s greatest achievement was his analysis of Oscar Slater&#x27;s trial for the murder of the Glasgow spinster Marion Gilchrist in 1908. Roughead assisted Arthur Conan Doyle, Craigie Aitchison and William Park for nearly 20 years exposing weaknesses in the Crown&#x27;s case and indeed he was cited as a witness in the 1928 appeal.

<text>165 Loreley is a large main-belt asteroid that was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on August 9, 1876, in Clinton, New York and named after the Lorelei, a figure in German folklore. It is orbiting the Sun at a distance of and a low eccentricity of 0.08. The orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 11.2° to the plane of the ecliptic.

In the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide gathered light curve data that was ultimately used to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids, including (165) Loreley. The light curve of this asteroid varies by no more than 0.2 in magnitude, while the derived shape model shows multiple flat spots on the surface. The asteroid has an oblate shape with a size ratio of 1.26 ± 0.08 between the major and minor axes, as determined from the W. M. Keck Observatory.

Between 2003 and 2021, 165 Loreley has been observed to occult thirteen stars.

<text>Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier (; May 8, 1839 – June 27, 1920) was a Canadian judge, author, and lyricist. He wrote the lyrics of the original French version of the Canadian national anthem &quot;O Canada&quot;. He was born in Saint-Placide, Quebec, to Charles Routhier and Angélique Lafleur.

==Early life and education==

Routhier was born and grew up in Saint-Placide, Quebec, on his family&#x27;s farm. He attended Séminaire de Ste-Thérèse, and later studied law at Université Laval. He graduated and was called to the Quebec bar in 1861.

==Career==
Routhier practised law in Kamouraska until he was appointed to the Quebec Superior Court in 1873 (as Chief Justice from 1904 to 1906) and Admiralty of the Exchequer Court of Canada (from 1897 to 1906).

Routhier ran as a Conservative candidate for the riding of Kamouraska in several federal elections, but he was never elected. 

Routhier wrote a number of books under the name Jean Piquefort.

Routhier&#x27;s poem &quot;Ô Canada&quot; was commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Théodore Robitaille for the 1880 Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony.

In June 1914, Routhier was one of the three judges appointed to conduct the Commission of Inquiry into the sinking of the Canadian Pacific steamship , which had resulted in the loss of 1,012 lives.

<text>Many religious communities have the term Sisters of Charity in their name. Some &quot;Sisters of Charity&quot; communities refer to the Vincentian tradition alone, or in America to the tradition of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton (whose sisters are also of the Vincentian tradition), but others are unrelated. The rule of Vincent de Paul for the Daughters of Charity has been adopted and adapted by at least sixty founders of religious institutes for sisters around the world.

==Vincentian-Setonian tradition ==

In 1633, Vincent de Paul, a French priest and Louise de Marillac, a widow, established the Company of the Daughters of Charity as a group of women dedicated to serving the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot;. They set up soup kitchens, organized community hospitals, established schools and homes for orphaned children, offered job training, taught the young to read and write, and improved prison conditions. Louise de Marillac and Vincent de Paul both died in 1660, and by this time there were more than forty houses of the Daughters of Charity in France, and the sick poor were cared for in their own dwellings in twenty-six parishes in Paris. The French Revolution shut down all convents, but the society was restored in 1801 and eventually spread to Austria, Australia, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Portugal, Turkey, Britain and the Americas.

In 1809, the American Elizabeth Ann Seton founded the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph, adapting the rule of the French Daughters of Charity for her Emmitsburg, Maryland, community.

In 1817, Mother Seton sent three Sisters to New York City to establish an orphanage. In 1829, four Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Maryland, traveled to Cincinnati, to open St. Peter’s Girl’s Orphan Asylum and School. In 1850, the Sulpician priests of Baltimore successfully negotiated that the Emmitsburg community be united with the international community based in Paris. The foundations in New York and Cincinnati decided to become independent diocesan congregations. Six separate religious congregations trace their roots to the beginnings of the Sisters of Charity in Emmitsburg. In addition to the original community of Sisters at Emmitsburg (now part of the Vincentian order), they are based in New York City; Cincinnati, Ohio; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Convent Station, New Jersey; and Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

In 2011, the Daughters of Charity established The Province of St. Louise, bringing together the West Central, East Central, Southeast, and Northeast Provinces of the United States. Los Altos Hills in California remains a separate province.

<text>John Long Routt (April 25, 1826 – August 13, 1907) was an American politician of the Republican Party. Born in Eddyville, Kentucky, he served as the first and seventh governor of Colorado from 1876 to 1879 and 1891 to 1893. He also served as mayor of Denver, Colorado from 1883 to 1885. He died in Denver, Colorado.

==Early years==
John Long Routt was born in Eddyville, Kentucky, and moved to Bloomington, Illinois shortly thereafter where he completed his public school education. Upon completion of his studies, he worked as a carpenter prior to entering elected office.

While living in Illinois, he attained his first elected office as Sheriff of McLean County, Illinois. Routt&#x27;s blossoming public service career was abruptly interrupted by service in the American Civil War, during which acted as a captain in the 94th Illinois Volunteer Infantry.

==Governor of Colorado==

===Colorado Territory===
U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed John Routt as the Governor of the Territory of Colorado on March 29, 1875. Statehood had long been Colorado&#x27;s primary interest. Thomas Patterson and Jerome Chaffee, in House Bill 435, initially provided for the creation of the Colorado state government. Routt&#x27;s time as Territorial Governor was largely spent deliberating the contents of the Colorado state constitution.

===State of Colorado===
After Colorado was established as a state, the increasingly popular Routt easily won the gubernatorial election without making a single speech in public. As the first governor, Routt tackled the major issues Colorado was facing at the time, including violence in and around the city of Creede, Colorado, as well as problems dealing with county valuations.

Routt was also very popular among the female citizenry of the state because of his strong support for women&#x27;s suffrage - with nudges from his wife, Eliza Pickrell Routt, a pioneer in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. At one point, he arranged a speaking tour for popular women&#x27;s suffragist Susan B. Anthony and personally escorted her around the state. When women in Colorado first became able to vote in 1893, his wife, Eliza Pickrell Routt, became the first woman to register to vote in Colorado history.

==Later life==
Following his first two terms as Governor of Colorado, Routt entered the private sector, but re-entered public service again to serve as the mayor of Denver, Colorado from 1883 to 1885. After unsuccessfully running for the United States Senate, Routt ran successfully for the governorship again in 1891, and served as Colorado&#x27;s seventh Governor until 1893. His third term was marked by a high level of disagreement within the Republicans in Colorado&#x27;s state government.

Routt was buried in Denver&#x27;s Riverside Cemetery.
Routt County, Colorado and Routt National Forest are named in his honor.

<text>Pierre Paul Émile Roux FRS (; 17 December 18533 November 1933) was a French physician, bacteriologist and immunologist. Roux was one of the closest collaborators of Louis Pasteur (1822–1895), a co-founder of the Pasteur Institute, and responsible for the institute&#x27;s production of the anti-diphtheria serum, the first effective therapy for this disease. Additionally, he investigated cholera, chicken-cholera, rabies, and tuberculosis. Roux is regarded as a founder of the field of immunology.

==Early years==
Roux was born in Confolens, Charente. It is believed that Roux had a fatherless childhood. He received his baccalaureate in sciences in 1871 and started his studies in 1872 at the Medical School of Clermont-Ferrand. He worked initially as a student assistant in chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences, under Émile Duclaux. From 1874 to 1878, he continued his studies in Paris and was admitted as clinical assistant at Hôtel-Dieu. Between 1874 and 1877, Roux received a fellowship for the Military School at Val-de-Grâce, but quit it after failing to present his dissertation in due time. It is also believed that Roux may have been dismissed from the military for some form of insubordination. In 1878, he started to work as an assistant to the course on fermentation given by his patron Duclaux at the Sorbonne University.

In 1878, Pierre Paul Emile Roux married Rose Anna Shedlock in London, but it was kept a secret. Shedlock was a historical figure in her own right, being one of the first women medical students in Britain and Europe. Shedlock met Roux while both were in medical school in Paris. Shedlock died in 1879 of tuberculosis within days of Roux performing his critical experiments on chicken cholera vaccine. In an inaccurate biography, Roux&#x27;s niece stated that Shedlock contracted tuberculosis from Roux. However, this is unlikely, given that Shedlock had symptoms before marrying Roux. According to his niece, Roux allegedly believed that marriage was an opportunity for women to satisfy their &quot;deepest aspirations&quot;, while for men it was &quot;mutilation&quot;.

==Work with Pasteur==
Duclaux recommended Roux to Louis Pasteur, who was looking for assistants, and Roux joined Pasteur&#x27;s laboratory as a research assistant from 1878 to 1883 at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. When Roux first began his career with Pasteur, he started as an animal inoculator. He performed well in the technical tasks, and became more involved with research. Roux began his research on the microbiological causation of diseases, and in this capacity worked with Pasteur on avian cholera (1879–1880) and anthrax (1879–1890), and was involved in the famous experiment on anthrax vaccination of animals at . In this vaccination experiment, Roux and Charles Chamberland injected 25 sheep with their anthrax vaccine, and the other 25 were unvaccinated. A few weeks later, all 50 sheep were injected with the anthrax bacillus. When it was clear that all 25 vaccinated sheep would survive, and all 25 unvaccinated sheep would die, Pasteur arrived to great fanfare.

Louis Pasteur and Émile Roux were sometimes in disagreement in their approach to disease. Pasteur was an experimental scientist, whereas Roux was more focused on clinical medicine. They also held different religious and political beliefs, with Pasteur being a right- leaning Catholic, and Roux being a left-leaning atheist. Given their many differences, they clashed often as they worked towards vaccines against anthrax and rabies. The main issues between Roux and Pasteur regarded the ethics of human experimentation, specifically, the amount of evidence from animal experimentation needed in order to justify giving the rabies vaccine to humans. Roux was more reluctant to give the vaccine to humans without further evidence that it was safe in animals.

In 1883, he presented a doctoral dissertation in medicine titled &quot;Des Nouvelles Acquisitions sur la Rage&quot;, in which he described his research on rabies with Pasteur since 1881, which led to the development of the first vaccination against this fearsome disease. Roux discovered the idea of intracranial transmission of rabies, which paved the road for many more Pastorian milestones in research. Roux was now recognized as an expert in the nascent sciences of medical microbiology and immunology. With Pasteur&#x27;s other assistants (Edmond Nocard, Louis Thuillier, who died while in Alexandria after contracting the disease, and Straus), Roux traveled in 1883 to Egypt to study a human cholera outbreak there, but they were unable to find the pathogen for the disease, which was later discovered in Alexandria by the German physician Robert Koch (1843–1910).

In 1883 and for the following 40 years, Émile Roux became closely involved with the creation of what was to become the Pasteur Institute. Roux is known for developing the concept of combining development, research, and application in a specialized hospital. The most distinctive feature of the Pasteur Hospital was free access to medical care. The hospital was also known for being very hygienic for the time period. He divided his time between biomedical research and administrative duties. In 1888, an important year in his career, he accepted the position of Director of Services, joined the editorial board of the &quot;Annales de l&#x27;Institut Pasteur&quot;, and established the first regular course on microbiological technique, which would become extremely influential in the training of many important French and foreign researchers and physicians in infectious diseases.

==Diphtheria research==
The development of a diphtheria anti-toxin serum was a race between researchers Emil Behring in Berlin, and Émile Roux in Paris. They both developed it nearly simultaneously. However, the serum was marketed differently in each country. In Germany, the serum was marketed in a private business setting, whereas in France, the serum was distributed through a communal health care system. The race to develop the diphtheria anti-toxin serum was considered a national rivalry, although each team of researchers adopted each other&#x27;s experimental practices and built off of each other. In a controversy, the first Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine was given to Emil Von Behring for his work on the serum therapy for diphtheria. Roux had been nominated in 1888 for the isolation of the diphtheria toxin, but didn&#x27;t win the prize in 1901 because his discovery was deemed to be too &quot;old.&quot; Over the years, Roux came close to the Nobel Prize but never won.

Also in 1883, Roux published, with Alexandre Yersin, the first of his classical works on the causation of diphtheria by the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus, then an extremely prevalent and lethal disease, particularly among children. Diphtheria is contagious microbial disease marked by throat lesions, polyneuritis, myocarditis, low blood pressure, and collapse. He studied its toxin and its properties, and began in 1891 to develop an effective serum to treat the disease, following the demonstration, by Emil Adolf von Behring (1854–1917) and Kitasato Shibasaburō (1852–1931) that antibodies against the diphtheric toxin could be produced in animals. He successfully demonstrated the use of this antitoxin with Auguste Chaillou in a study with 300 diseased children in the Hôpital des Enfants-Malades and was henceforth hailed as a scientific hero in medical congresses throughout Europe.

==Other research and later years==
In the following years, Roux dedicated himself indefatigably to many investigations on the microbiology and practical immunology of tetanus, tuberculosis, syphilis, and pneumonia. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1900. In 1904, he was nominated to Pasteur&#x27;s former position as General Director of the Pasteur Institute.

In 1916, he moved to a small apartment in the Pasteur Hospital, where he died on 3 November 1933.

== Awards and honors ==
* In 1917, he received the Copley Medal for his outstanding achievements in research.
* Asteroid 293366 Roux, discovered by French amateur astronomer Bernard Christophe in 2007, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 12 March 2017 ().
* The Roux culture bottle, a flask for culturing cells, is named after him.

<doc id="747093" wikidata="Q49669" url="?curid=747093" title="United States District Court for the Southern District of New York">
<text>The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (in case citations, S.D.N.Y.) is a federal trial court whose geographic jurisdiction encompasses eight counties of the State of New York. Two of these are in New York City: New York (Manhattan) and Bronx; six are in the Hudson Valley: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess, and Sullivan. Appeals from the Southern District of New York are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

Because it covers Manhattan, the Southern District of New York has long been one of the most active and influential federal trial courts in the United States. It often has jurisdiction over America&#x27;s largest financial institutions and prosecution of white-collar crime and other federal crimes. Because of its age, being the oldest federal court in the history of the United States, great influence, described as &quot;the preeminent trial court in the nation&quot;, and its strong independence, it is colloquially called the &quot;Mother Court&quot;, or the &quot;Sovereign District of New York.&quot; 

The district itself has had several prominent judges on its bench, including Learned Hand, Michael Mukasey, and Sonia Sotomayor, and many of the U.S. attorneys for the district have been prominent American legal and political figures, such as Elihu Root, Henry L. Stimson, Robert Morgenthau, Rudy Giuliani, James Comey, Michael J. Garcia, and Preet Bharara.

== History ==

The United States District Court for the District of New York was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, on September 24, 1789. It first sat at the old Merchants Exchange on Broad Street in November 1789, the first federal court to do so. The Act of April 9, 1814, 3 Stat. 120, divided the District of New York into Northern and Southern Districts.

The subdivision of the district was reportedly instigated by Matthias B. Tallmadge, out of antipathy for fellow district judge William P. Van Ness. These Districts were later further subdivided with the creation of the Eastern District on February 25, 1865 by 13 Stat. 438, and the Western District on May 12, 1900, by 31 Stat. 175. Public Law 95-408 (enacted October 2, 1978) transferred Columbia, Greene, and Ulster counties from the Southern to the Northern district.

For the first hundred years of its existence, the case load of the district was dominated first by admiralty cases, and then by a mix of admiralty and bankruptcy cases. The primary responsibility for hearing bankruptcy cases has since been transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, with the District Court only reviewing cases already decided by a bankruptcy judge.

Since its creation, the Southern District of New York has had over 150 judges, more than any other District. Twenty-one judges from the Southern District of New York have been elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit—Samuel Blatchford, Charles Merrill Hough, Learned Hand, Julius Marshuetz Mayer, Augustus Noble Hand, Martin Thomas Manton, Robert P. Patterson, Harold Medina, Irving Kaufman, Wilfred Feinberg, Walter R. Mansfield, Murray Gurfein, Lawrence W. Pierce, Pierre N. Leval, John M. Walker Jr., Sonia Sotomayor, Denny Chin, Barrington Daniels Parker Jr., Gerard E. Lynch, Richard J. Sullivan, and Alison Nathan. Blatchford and Sotomayor, after being elevated from the Southern District of New York to serve as Circuit Judges for the Second Circuit, were later elevated to the Supreme Court of the United States. The longest serving judge, David Norton Edelstein, served as an active judge for 43 years to the day, and in senior status for an additional six years.

Judges of the court have gone on to other high governmental positions. Robert P. Patterson served as Under Secretary of War under President Franklin Roosevelt and was Secretary of War under President Harry S. Truman. Louis Freeh served as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from September 1993 to June 2001. Michael Mukasey served as the 81st United States Attorney General under President George W. Bush.

<text>Stojan Steve Tesich (; September 29, 1942 – July 1, 1996) was a Serbian-American screenwriter, playwright, and novelist. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1979 for the film &quot;Breaking Away&quot;.

==Early life==
Steve Tesich was born as Stojan Tešić (pronounced &quot;TESH-ich&quot;) in Užice, in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia (now Serbia) on September 29, 1942. He immigrated to the United States with his mother and sister when he was 14 years old. His family settled in East Chicago, Indiana. His father died in 1962.

Tesich graduated from Indiana University Bloomington in 1965 with a BA in Russian. He was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He went on to do graduate work at Columbia University, receiving an MA in Russian Literature in 1967.

After graduation, he worked as a Department of Welfare caseworker in Brooklyn, New York in 1968.

==Career==
He began his career as a playwright with the 1969 play &quot;The Predators&quot;, which was staged as a workshop production at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.

In the 1970s, he wrote a series of plays that were staged at The American Place Theatre in New York City. The first of these plays, &quot;The Carpenters&quot;, premiered during the 1970-1971 season. &quot;Baba Goya&quot; made its debut at the theater in May 1973; the cast included Olympia Dukakis and John Randolph. Later that year, the play was staged at the Cherry Lane Theatre under a different name (&quot;Nourish the Beast&quot;).

The play &quot;The Carpenters&quot; starring Vincent Gardenia, Jon Korkes, and Kitty Winn, presented on the Hollywood Television Theatre&#x27;s Conflicts series, was shown on PBS on December 19, 1973 in a telecast from 8:30-9:30 PM EST. The theme of the play, directed by Norman Lloyd, was the disintegration of an American family divided by the generation gap.

John Randolph, Eileen Brennan, and John Beck starred in the comedy &quot;Nourish the Beast&quot; on PBS on Thursday, February 12, 1974, also presented as part of the Hollywood Television Theatre&#x27;s Conflicts series. The play, also directed by Norman Lloyd, is about a dysfunctional family headed by the eccentric Baba Goya who confronts crises with her husband, son, and daughter.

Tesich&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Breaking Away&quot; (1979) had its origins in his college years. He had been an alternate rider in 1962 for the Phi Kappa Psi team in the Little 500 bicycle race. Teammate Dave Blase rode 139 of 200 laps and was the victorious rider crossing the finish line for his team. They subsequently developed a friendship. Blase became the model for the main character in &quot;Breaking Away&quot;. The working title of the film script was &quot;Bambino&quot;. The film was a hit, and Tesich won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He also created a short-lived TV series of the same name.

His play &quot;Division Street&quot; opened on Broadway at the Ambassador Theatre in New York City on October 8, 1980. The production starred John Lithgow and Keene Curtis. It closed after 21 performances. The play was revived in 1987 at the Second Stage, with Saul Rubinek in the lead role.

Tesich reunited with Peter Yates, the director of &quot;Breaking Away&quot;, on the 1981 thriller &quot;Eyewitness&quot; starring Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Morgan Freeman, and Christopher Plummer.

His next screenplay was for the semi-autobiographical film &quot;Four Friends&quot; which was directed by Arthur Penn which covered the activism and turbulence of the 1960s. Vincent Canby of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote in his review: &quot;For Mr. Tesich, it is another original work by one of our best young screenwriters.&quot; Roger Ebert wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; that it was &quot;a very good movie.&quot;

He adapted John Irving&#x27;s novel &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; for the screen in 1982 directed by George Roy Hill and starring Robin Williams and Glenn Close in her film debut. The best-selling novel had been described as unfilmable. The screenplay was nominated for Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) in 1983.

Tesich returned to the sport of cycling with the screenplay for &quot;American Flyers&quot; (1985). The main characters were two brothers, played by Kevin Costner and David Marshall Grant, who enter a long-distance bicycle race in the Colorado Rockies.

His final screenplay was for the 1985 film &quot;Eleni&quot;, starring John Malkovich, Kate Nelligan, and Linda Hunt, based on the Nicholas Gage book, also directed by Peter Yates.

His novel &quot;Karoo&quot; was published posthumously in 1998. Arthur Miller described the novel: &quot;Fascinating—a real satiric invention full of wise outrage.&quot; The novel was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book for 1998. The novel also appeared in a German translation as &quot;Abspann&quot;, and it was also translated in France in 2012 where it was acclaimed by the critics and became a best-seller.

Oxford Dictionaries credits Tesich with the first use of the term &quot;post-truth,&quot; which Oxford defined as &quot;circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.&quot; Ralph Keyes, author of &quot;The Post-Truth Era&quot; (2004), also says he first saw the term &quot;in a 1992 Nation essay by the late Steve Tesich.&quot; Post-truth was Oxford&#x27;s 2016 Word of the Year.

==Death==
Tesich died in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada on July 1, 1996, following a heart attack. He was 53 years old.

==Honors and awards==
In 1973, Tesich won the Vernon Rice or Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Playwright for the play &quot;Baba Goya&quot;, which is also known under the title &quot;Nourish the Beast&quot;.

Tesich won the following awards for the &quot;Breaking Away&quot; screenplay in 1979:

*Academy Award, Best Original Screenplay
*National Society of Film Critics Award, Best Screenplay
*New York Film Critics Circle Award, Best Screenplay
*Writers Guild of America Award, Best-Written Comedy Written Directly for the Screen
*Screenwriter of the Year, ALFS Award from the London Critics Circle Film Awards, 1981

He also received a nomination in 1980 for a Golden Globe for Best Screenplay-Motion Picture.

In 2005, the Ministry of Religion and Diaspora established the annual &quot;Stojan—Steve Tešić Award&quot;, to be awarded to the writers of Serbian origin that write in other languages.

<text>Daniel Hale Rowan (July 22, 1922 – September 22, 1987) was an American actor and comedian. He was featured in the television show &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, in which he played straight man to Dick Martin and won the 1969 Emmy for Outstanding Variety or Musical Series.

==Early life and career==
Rowan was born on July 22, 1922, on a carnival train near the small town of Beggs, Oklahoma, as Daniel Hale David. He toured with his parents, Oscar and Nellie David, who performed a singing and dancing act with the carnival.

He was orphaned at the age of 11, spent four years at the McClelland Home in Pueblo, Colorado, where he was taken in by a foster family at the age of 16 and enrolled in Central High School. After graduating from high school in 1940, he hitchhiked to Los Angeles and found a job in the mailroom at Paramount Pictures, quickly ingratiating himself with studio head Buddy DeSylva. A year later he became Paramount&#x27;s youngest staff writer.

===World War II===
During World War II, Rowan served as a fighter pilot in the 8th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter Group United States Army Air Forces. He flew a Curtiss P-40N Warhawk, AAF Ser. No. 42-104949, currently recorded under civilian registration N537BR, from which he shot down two Japanese aircraft before being downed and seriously wounded in another P-40 over New Guinea. His military decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Air Medal, and the Purple Heart.

===Comedy team===

After his discharge, Rowan returned to California, where he teamed up with Dick Martin and started a comedy nightclub act. Martin was originally the straight man and Rowan the comic, but it did not work—as Rowan recalled, Martin could never remember lines if they were not funny. They switched roles and found steady work in nightclubs. The established team of Tommy Noonan and Peter Marshall was friendly with Rowan and Martin, so much so that whenever Noonan and/or Marshall could not keep a nightclub engagement, they would send Rowan and Martin in their stead; Noonan and Marshall would often write material for Rowan and Martin to use.

In 1958, Rowan and Martin made their movie debut in the offbeat western comedy &quot;Once Upon a Horse...&quot;, written and directed by Hal Kanter. The team was regarded as promising, but no further offers for movies materialized. The comics returned to nightclubs and television. Later, Rowan was a serious contender to host &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;. However, former mentor Peter Marshall had since become estranged from Rowan and took the job solely to prevent Rowan from getting it, a grudge stemming from when Noonan fell ill and Marshall felt that Rowan had not shown support for Noonan&#x27;s fight to live (Noonan would eventually die in 1968). Marshall later found out that Rowan never told Martin he was in the running to host.

Rowan and Martin hosted a free-wheeling television comedy revue that aired during the summer of 1967. NBC accepted the Rowan and Martin show, now called &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, as a midseason replacement series, and it quickly became a national phenomenon, running through 1973.

At the height of the show&#x27;s popularity, Rowan and Martin starred in the 1969 film &quot;The Maltese Bippy&quot;, which was a notorious failure. Rowan also appeared twice as an actor on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, first in a two-part 1977 episode playing the part of Alan Danver, husband of Barbara Danver, played by Juliet Mills. He appeared again as Matt Heller, a father estranged for 20 years from his ex-wife, Jenny Heller, played by Marion Ross, and his daughter, Beth Heller, played by Eve Plumb in the October 30, 1982 episode &quot;Command Performance&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Rowan married the 1945 Miss America first-runner-up Phyllis J. Mathis. They had three children: Thomas Patrick, Mary Ann, and Christie Esther. He and Mathis were later divorced. In 1963, Rowan married Australian model Adriana Van Ballegooyen. They divorced eight years later. In 1974, he married model and TV spokeswoman Joanna Young, to whom he remained married until his death.

==Later years and death==
Rowan retired in the early 1980s and spent the remainder of his years between his residence in Englewood, Florida, and his barge in the canals of France, although he did reunite with Martin for some brief appearances on the NBC 60th Anniversary Show in 1986. In his forties, he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which led to his becoming insulin-dependent. He died of lymphoma in 1987 at his Englewood home. His body was cremated.

In 1986, a book of letters written between himself and author John D. MacDonald was published titled &quot;A Friendship: The Letters of Dan Rowan and John D. MacDonald, 1967-1974&quot;.

Rowan was portrayed by Jonathan Whittaker in the 1995 HBO movie &quot;Sugartime&quot;.

<text>Stephen Clegg Rowan (December 25. 1808 – March 31, 1890) was a vice admiral in the United States Navy, who served during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

==Early life and career==
Born in Dublin, Ireland, Rowan came to the United States at the age of 10 and lived in Piqua, Ohio. Rowan was a graduate of Miami University and was appointed as a midshipman in the U.S. Navy on February 1, 1826, at the age of 17. Later, he took an active role in the Mexican–American War, serving as executive officer of the sloop during the capture of Monterey, California on July 7, 1846, and in the occupation of both San Diego and Los Angeles. In January 1847 he led a provisional battalion, with the nominal rank of major, of seven companies of naval infantry (along with a company of artillery and a company of sappers and miners) for the recapture of Los Angeles.

==Civil War service==
Captain of the steam sloop at the outbreak of the American Civil War, he attempted to relieve Fort Sumter and to burn the Norfolk Navy Yard. In the fall of 1861, he assisted in the capture of the forts at Hatteras Inlet; then, taking command of a flotilla in the North Carolina sounds, he cooperated in the capture of Roanoke Island in February 1862. Promoted simultaneously to captain and commodore for gallantry, he then supported the capture of Elizabeth City, Edenton, and New Bern. During the summer of 1863, he commanded the broadside ironclad on blockade duty off Charleston, South Carolina and the following August assumed command of Federal forces in the North Carolina sounds. During this time the rebel semi-submersible CSS &quot;David&quot; attacked the &quot;New Ironsides&quot; with a spar torpedo. In the ensuing explosion, one man was killed and a large hole was torn into the ironclad but she continued her blockading duties.

==Post Civil War service==
Commissioned rear admiral on July 25, 1866, Rowan served as commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard until 1867, when he assumed command of the Asiatic Squadron. Returning in 1870, he was appointed vice admiral, following the death of Admiral David Farragut and the promotion of Vice Admiral David Dixon Porter in August of that year. In December 1870 Rowan reached the mandatory retirement age of 62 but, like admirals Farragut and Porter before him, he was allowed to remain on active duty.

Rowan served as commandant of the New York Navy Yard from 1872 to 1876, as governor of the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1881, and as superintendent of the Naval Observatory, Washington, D.C., from 1882 until his retirement in 1889 at the age of 80.

Rowan had a 63-year career, which was one of the longest in the history of the United States Navy.

In 1882 Admiral Rowan was elected as a First Class Companion of the District of Columbia Commander of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS). He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 2510. Rowan&#x27;s son, Hamilton Rowan, an officer in the U.S. Army, was elected as a Second Class Companion of MOLLUS and became a First Class Companion upon his father&#x27;s death.

Rowan died in Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1890. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<text>Philosophy for Children, sometimes abbreviated to P4C, is a movement that aims to teach reasoning and argumentative skills to children. There are also related methods sometimes called &quot;&quot;Philosophy for Young People&quot; or &quot;Philosophy for Kids&quot;&quot;. Often the hope is that this will be a key influential move towards a more democratic form of democracy. However, there is also a long tradition within higher education of developing alternative methods for teaching philosophy both in schools and colleges.

Although the noted developmental psychologist Jean Piaget was of the impression that children were not capable of critical thinking until age 11 or 12, the experience of many philosophers and teachers with young children gives reason to believe that children benefit from philosophical inquiry even in early primary school. Furthermore, there is empirical evidence that teaching children reasoning skills early in life greatly improves other cognitive and academic skills and greatly assists learning in general. 

==Method and practice of philosophy for children==
The pedagogy of philosophy for children is diverse. However, many practitioners including those working in the tradition of Matthew Lipman and the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children emphasize the use of a community of inquiry method which has roots in the work of philosopher John Dewey. The term &quot;inquiry&quot; is preferred to &quot;lesson&quot; because the emphasis is on the group inquiring together into questions with the teacher as a facilitator rather than the authoritative source of information.

===Questions and pictures as stimuli for conversation===

As a basis for discussing philosophy with children, the questions used (such as &quot;What is friendship?&quot;, &quot;Do animals have feelings?&quot;, and &quot;What is happiness?&quot;) are of crucial importance. The German educational scientist Michael Siegmund recommends asking children a philosophical question along with an inspiring picture. Together, the image and question create an opening for discussing philosophy. Among other things, natural landscapes, pictures of animals and people, certain social situations, or even fantasy pictures can be used. This dual method can be used as early as at daycare for children ages 4 and up, as well as at school or with family.

===Stories as stimuli for conversation===

Along with pictures, stories can also lead to discussions of philosophy with children. A story can thus be an occasion to start a philosophical conversation with children. Adults can ask the children philosophical questions while they are reading aloud as well. Stories, combined with profound questions, can inspire children and promote their creativity and imagination. Adults can either add &quot;philosophical questions&quot; to &quot;classic&quot; stories and fairy tales themselves, or use special children&#x27;s books for discussing philosophy with children. Michael Siegmund recommends stories in which animals are the main characters and child-friendly questions are asked. Possible topics may include poverty and wealth, friendship and family, happiness, freedom, environmental pollution, justice, and more.

===Diversity in the United Kingdom===
There is particular diversity in the UK, owing to the large number of competing and collaborating freelance trainers each emphasising different strands of the pedagogy. Roger Sutcliffe&#x27;s practice includes the use of news stories; Steve Williams has emphasised the importance of dialogues that model argument as well as raising philosophical issues; Will Ord emphasises the use of striking photos, often containing contrasts that suggest opposing concepts; Jason Buckley advocates a more physical, game-based approach and &quot;Philosophy in Role&quot;, in which children philosophise within a story as characters confronted with a variety of problems.

SAPERE is the UK&#x27;s leading provider of P4C training. Registered in 1994, the charity has trained over 27,000 teachers and other individuals in the use of P4C. SAPERE&#x27;s mission is to advance the educational, personal, and social development of young people, especially those facing disadvantage, through the promotion of P4C. The organisation&#x27;s work gained national prominence in 2015 when Durham University School of Education published results of a randomised control trial of P4C with over 3,000 primary school students. The study was sponsored by the Education Endowment Foundation. The limited study found that P4C advanced attainment for all students and had a particularly strong impact on children from disadvantaged backgrounds. A larger later study showed little attainment advancement in the classroom context.

Co-founded by Peter Worley and Emma Worley, The Philosophy Foundation&#x27;s specialist philosophy teachers (all philosophy graduates) specifically use philosophical material, including thought-experiments and stories or activities that lead to questions from the philosophical canon. They make use of carefully structured questioning strategies and also the introduction of thinking skills in order to develop good thinking habits from a young age. The questioning strategies are used to introduce dialectic along Platonic lines and in order to maintain philosophical focus. Uniquely they have a methodology that introduces writing and meta-analysis with older primary and secondary students.

UK-based Thinking Space is philosopher Grace Robinson and a network of associated philosophers and educators whose work is characterised by playful and experimental collaborations. This work with a range of practitioners, among them artists, scientists, and academics, aims to bring philosophical issues alive for children and young people. Thinking Space&#x27;s most notable collaboration is with the University of Leeds on &quot;Leeds Philosophy Exchange&quot;, an accredited undergraduate course in which philosophy students facilitate philosophical inquiry in local primary schools, alongside teachers trained by Thinking Space in P4C.

===West-coast United States===
A particular way of doing philosophy with children is illustrated by the work of Chris Phillips with the Philosophers Club at Cesar Chavez Elementary School in the Mission District, San Francisco, California.

Professor William Barry of Notre Dame de Namur University is pioneering a new approach to P4C called Philosophy for Children and Community (P4C2) in the San Francisco Bay Area. His contribution to evolving the idea of P4C involves young people becoming novice critical theory action researchers and meaningful members of communities of inquiry focused on human flourishing for every person. Another key component of Barry&#x27;s P4C2 is the importance of children gaining ontological weight from participation in their communities of inquiry by understanding the meaning of quality in praxis in a transformational way through TQ Theory. The Institute of P4C2 has recently been developed by Living Leadership Today, LLC, founder Maria Rachelle in Silicon Valley, California, and resulted in the creation of the online international scholarly journal, the &quot;International Journal of Transformative Research&quot;.

==Leading contributors==
One of the salient differences between proponents of philosophy for children is in their choice of stimuli—starting points for discussions. 
*Matthew Lipman, called &quot;the most influential figure&quot; in helping young students develop philosophical thinking by Gareth Matthews, is credited with starting the Philosophy for Children movement in the 1970s. After witnessing political upheaval taking place on University campuses nationwide in the 1960s, Lipman realized that philosophical and critical thinking should be encouraged much earlier in the academic setting. He founded the &quot;Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children&quot; (IAPC) at Montclair State University (then Montclair State College) in 1974. Lipman&#x27;s method involves reading philosophically stimulating narrative to children and encouraging them to come up with philosophical questions in response. The questions set the agenda for a collaborative inquiry where the teacher acts as both facilitator and co-inquirer. The lessons are dialogue-based with students usually sitting in a circle and taking turns at suggesting solutions, expressing opinions, putting forth arguments and counter arguments, providing examples, constructing criteria, and building on each other&#x27;s ideas with the aim of coming to a settlement regarding the initial philosophical questions that stimulated the dialogue. Lipman&#x27;s ideas about learning, pedagogy and curriculum are heavily influenced by the educational and philosophical ideas of the American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey. Many of the materials used by the IAPC are philosophical children&#x27;s novels that were published by Lipman, including &quot;Harry Stottlemeier&#x27;s Discovery&quot;, which he published in 1969. Others have built on Lipman&#x27;s ideas and developed further teaching resources and learning activities that complement his original Philosophy for Children novels and pedagogical approach, such as Phil Cam&#x27;s popular teaching resources. Lipman wrote the world&#x27;s first systematic pre-college philosophy curriculum and created both masters and doctoral programs in the field of Philosophy for Children. He also founded &quot;Thinking: The Journal of Philosophy for Children&quot;.
*Gareth Matthews worked with a variety of students, but primarily with students in late primary school (5th grade and thereabouts). Matthews&#x27;s method was to get the students to actively create philosophical settings, to &quot;make the philosophical problem their own&quot;. One of his best-known techniques was to provide the beginning of a philosophically provocative story. He then recorded/transcribes student comments, put them in the mouths of characters in the story, and brought the story continuation to the next class session for further discussion. Such interactions are compiled in his book &quot;Dialogues With Children&quot;.
*Karin Murris of Witwatersrand University, South Africa, and Joanna Haynes of Plymouth University, England, have popularised the use of children&#x27;s picture books as an alternative to purpose-written materials.
*Tom Wartenberg of Mount Holyoke, Massachusetts, has also written a large number of discussion plans for philosophising with picture books.
*Jana Mohr Lone has written about children&#x27;s philosophical thinking and the benefits of encouraging children to engage in philosophical inquiry.
*Ellen Duthie, together with her team based in Spain, researches and develops the possibilities of Visual Philosophy for Children (and adults), exploring different ways of engaging and stimulating philosophical dialogue through visuals in her Wonder Ponder series of books.

==P4C organisations==
===International organisations===
====IAPC====
The Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC), which has been recognized by the American Philosophical Association for excellence and innovation, utilizes Lipman&#x27;s method, exposing children to philosophically stimulating narrative to encourage them to create and ask their own philosophical questions, actively in the K–12 classroom through a longstanding partnership with the Montclair public school system. Students are encouraged to ask their questions and the philosophical facilitator (a member of the IAPC) helps the children to develop philosophical skills and dispositions of critical, caring, and creative thinking in order to get the young students to come to reasonable judgment about what is &quot;best to do or believe,&quot; in response to the initial question. IAPC has a large teacher preparation component and provides teacher manuals that include discussion plans specifically designed to assist in the facilitation of philosophical discussions that are general enough to answer most student questions. In addition to working directly with schoolchildren, members of the IAPC work with several constituencies, including professional and pre-professional educators, educational administrators and policy-makers, and faculty and students of education, philosophy and related disciplines. IAPC has trained educators worldwide to successfully implement their curriculum in their home states and countries. Philosophy and Children organization offers introductory workshops and certificate courses in schools and for graduate teachers in Australia.

===Regional organisations===
====Asia-Pacific====
=====Federation of Asia-Pacific Philosophy in Schools Associations=====
In the Asia-Pacific an extensive P4C network has developed since the 1980s. Teacher associations have been established in each Australian state, across New Zealand and in Hong Kong and Singapore for some decades. These teacher associations came together to form the Federation of Asia-Pacific Philosophy in Schools Associations (FAPSA) in the 1990s, which is the peak body for philosophy and P4C teachers in the Asia-Pacific region. FAPSA develop the standards and courses for teachers to teach philosophy in the classroom across their regions. Through professional development and advocacy initiatives, FAPSA seeks to enrich and expand philosophy education in primary and secondary schools across the Asia-Pacific. FAPSA is a member organisation of the International Council of Philosophy with Children (ICPIC), whose principles and values guide their work. FAPSA has been instrumental in promoting P4C throughout the region through dialogue, opportunities for training and ongoing projects. The Federation also undertakes non-competitive P4C events for schools in the form of Community of Inquiry days and Philosophy in Public Spaces.

FAPSA has an international, academically peer-reviewed open access journal, the &quot;Journal for Philosophy in Schools&quot;, which focusses on research into philosophy with school-aged children. This journal was the successor to the Federation&#x27;s previous publication, the &quot;Journal of Critical and Creative Thinking&quot; and was established by the current editors Laura D&#x27;Olimpio and Andrew Peterson.

======FAPSA regional associations======
FAPSA has associates across the Asia-Pacific region and invites representatives from regions without affiliates to contribute to their governance.

*Society for Philosophy for the Young (Sophy) – Australian Capital Territory
*Hong Kong Uni Graduates Association Education Foundation – Hong Kong
*Philosophy in Schools Association of NSW (PiNS) – New South Wales
*P4C New Zealand (P4CNZ) – New Zealand
*Association for Philosophy in Learning – Singapore
*South Australian Association for Philosophy in Education – South Australia
*Victorian Association for Philosophy for Schools – Victoria

=====PCYNAP=====
*The Philosophy with Children and Youth Network for Asia and the Pacific

=====APIS=====
*Association for Philosophy in Schools in Western Australia

====Europe====
The growth of a community engaging European philosophy with children practitioners culminated in the establishment of Stichting SOPHIA — The European Foundation for the Advancement of Doing Philosophy with Children - in 1993, with Eulalia Bosch (Catalonia) serving as president, and Karel van der Leeuw (the Netherlands) as secretary. Adopting the motto of the European Community (now the EU), &quot;unity through diversity&quot;, SOPHIA supported the development of doing philosophy with children within all the different European cultures and languages, and nurtured the community among practitioners as the foundation for collaborative work and mutual development. Many groundbreaking and innovative projects have resulted from SOPHIA members working together, often funded by the EU. For example, European philosophy with children projects work with art, citizenship, excluded children, architecture, anti-racism, music, community development, and more.

====UK====
*SAPERE is a UK charity that trains teachers in P4C nationwide.
*Thinking Space, a UK company founded in 2008, that offers training in philosophy, and works with schools to devise creative philosophy projects that combine the expertise of philosophers and teachers.
*Educational charity The Philosophy Foundation (formerly The Philosophy Shop) trains philosophy graduates to do philosophy with primary and secondary school children and places them in schools nationwide. They also train teachers in the transferable skills of philosophy (questioning, thinking skills, and discourse skills), and are encouraging an inquiry-based approach to education at all levels, including tertiary.

====North America====
*The Philosophy Learning and Teaching Organization (PLATO) is a national organization in the USA that provides support and resources for bringing philosophy into pre-college classrooms.
*The North American Association for the Community of Inquiry (NAACI)

====South America====
*The Centro Latinamericano de Filosfía para Niños (CELAFIN)

===Regional college programmes===
====UK====
In the UK the University of Leeds now offers a students into schools programme called Leeds Philosophy Exchange, led by Grace Robinson. The University of Bristol is now working on Bristol Philosophy Exchange applying a similar model in which philosophy students and primary school teachers exchange skills and knowledge in weekly philosophical inquiry with children.

====US====
There are a number of college-level academic philosophy programs in the United States that do outreach to public schools, most notably at the University of Washington, University of Massachusetts – Boston, University of Chicago, California State University Long Beach, Texas A&amp;M University, Mount Holyoke College, Montclair State University, Michigan State University, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Notre Dame de Namur University, Creighton University, and Plattsburgh State University Of New York.

At the University of Washington, the Center for Philosophy for Children educates UW graduate and undergraduate students about how to facilitate philosophy sessions, and then sends them into Seattle classrooms with supervision and mentoring from experienced instructors. This program has introduced philosophy to thousands of public school students and runs many year-long weekly philosophy sessions in Seattle public school classrooms. The center has four graduate fellowships in pre-college philosophy and also runs regular workshops and programs for teachers, parents, and other adults on how to introduce philosophy to young people.

At the University of Chicago, students in the college teach in schools on Chicago&#x27;s South Side through the University&#x27;s Civic Knowledge Project. The class, known as Winning Words, is an after-school program that works with elementary, middle, and high school students in Chicago. The program aims to engage and inspire local youth through an education in philosophy, reasoning, and the verbal arts of dialogue and rhetoric; building self-confidence and exposing its students to a wide range of philosophical material. Recognized by the American Philosophical Association, the program provides an introduction to philosophy and Socratic dialogue and includes writing, public speaking, debate, drama, poetry, and art. The material uses the Socratic method to engage students and to encourage the use of critical thinking, reasoning, and expression. Such modes of thought and communication foster the sense of wonder that is at the root of serious introspection, intellectual growth, and ethical reflection. In February 2012, the American Philosophical Association&#x27;s Committee on Pre-Collegiate Philosophy featured Winning Words and the Civic Knowledge Project in its Central Division meeting.

Before the US Department of Education cut funding for such programs in the early 1990s, there were over 5,000 programs in K–12 schools nationwide which engaged young people in philosophical reflection or critical thinking, more generally. This number has dropped substantially.

==P4C Events==
===USA===
There is an annual &quot;Philosophy Slam&quot; competition for kids in grades K–12. Younger children are encouraged to submit artwork that illustrates their philosophical reflections while older children submit increasingly sophisticated written work.

===Australia===
Throughout Australia &quot;Community of Inquiry&quot; days are held by regional affiliates of the Federation of Asia-Pacific Philosophy in Schools Associations. These events apply the Lipman model of philosophical inquiry in an inter-mural setting. They are non-competitive by nature, with students encouraged to seek collaborative means to resolve philosophical challenges. Notable examples are held annually by the Victorian Association for Philosophy in Schools and the South Australian Philosophy in Education Association.

In 2007 a competition was created in Perth Western Australia called a Philosothon. Each Australian state now holds an annual Philosothon and Australian Association of Philosophy (AAP) hosts the Australasian Philosothon in different states each year. There are over 400 schools involved in Philosothons in Australasia, Europe and the UK.

==Journals==
There have been several academic journals devoted to publishing work regarding philosophy for/with children.
*&quot;Thinking: The Journal of Philosophy for Children&quot;, published between 1979 and 2014, contained some work by young philosophers but consisted primarily of work by adults about their work doing philosophy for children including lesson plans, developmental psychology, and work from the emerging field called &quot;Hermeneutics of childhood&quot; which is a multi-disciplinary approach to considering the intellectual and emotional life of children.
*&quot;Critical and Creative Thinking: The Australasian Journal of Philosophy in Education&quot;
*&quot;Analytic Teaching and Philosophical Praxis&quot; is a peer-reviewed, open access academic journal published out of Viterbo University (La Crosse, Wisconsin) dedicated to exploring the deeper philosophical and ethical implications of education.
*&quot;Childhood and Philosophy&quot;
*&quot;&quot; has as its mission the publication of work that features the philosophical reflections of children, themselves. Thus, it contains essays authored by children, transcripts of classroom dialogues with some commentary by moderators, artwork by children, and so forth. It also publishes the winners of the Philosophy Slam competition.
*&quot;Journal for Philosophy in Schools&quot; is the official journal of FAPSA. The focus of the journal is research into philosophy with school-aged children.
*&quot;Farhang (Culture): Quarterly Journal of Humanities and Cultural Studies&quot;, Issue Topics: Philosophy for Children, vol. 22 No 69, Spring 2009, Ed. Saeed Naji (Farhang) is the official journal of the Institute for Humanities and Cultural Studies. The issue includes articles in four languages about philosophy for children throughout the world.

==Books==
A number of books have been published on philosophy for children other than those mentioned above by Matthews and Lipman. Some are intended to be read by children, others by children with their parents, and still others by philosophers, educators, and policy-makers considering the merits of K–12 philosophy programs.

<text>Henry Augustus Rowland (November 27, 1848 – April 16, 1901) was an American physicist and Johns Hopkins educator. Between 1899 and 1901 he served as the first president of the American Physical Society. He is remembered for the high quality of the diffraction gratings he made and for the work he did with them on the solar spectrum.

==Early life, family and education==

Rowland was born in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, where his father Henry Augustus Rowland was a Presbyterian pastor. From an early age, the younger Rowland exhibited marked scientific tastes and spent his spare time in electrical and chemical experiments. 

He graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York in 1870.

==Career==
After college, Rowland worked for the Western New York railway, but he did not like the work. He became an instructor in natural science at the University of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio. He resigned in order to return to Troy as assistant professor of physics at Rensselaer. 

Rowland was considered one of the most brilliant American scientists of his day. However, initially his merits were not perceived in his own country. He was unable to secure the publication of many of his early scientific papers; but James Clerk Maxwell at once saw their excellence, and had them printed in &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;. When the managers of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, asked advice in Europe as to whom they should make their professor of physics, Rowland was overwhelmingly recommended as the best choice. In 1876, he became the first occupant of the chair of physics at Johns Hopkins University, a position which he retained until his death in Baltimore on April 16, 1901.

In the interval between his selection to Johns Hopkins and the assumption of his duties there, he studied physics under Hermann von Helmholtz in Berlin (1875–76), and carried out a well-known research on the effect of an electrically charged body in motion, showing it to give rise to a magnetic field.

After settling in Baltimore, Rowland focused on two important pieces of work. One was a redetermination of the ohm. For this he obtained a value which was substantially different from that ascertained by the committee of the British Association appointed for the purpose, but ultimately he had the satisfaction of seeing his own result accepted as the more correct of the two. The other was a new determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat. In this he used J. P. Joule&#x27;s paddle-wheel method, though with many improvements, the whole apparatus being on a larger scale and the experiments being conducted over a wider range of temperature. He obtained a result distinctly higher than Joule&#x27;s final figure. Additionally, he made many valuable observations on the thermodynamics involved, and on the variation of the specific heat of water, which Joule had assumed to be the same at all temperatures.

In 1882, before the Physical Society of London, Rowland gave a description of the diffraction gratings, with which his name is specially associated, and which have been of enormous advantage to astronomical spectroscopy. These gratings consist of pieces of metal or glass ruled by means of a diamond point with a very large number of parallel lines, on the extreme accuracy of which their efficiency depends. For their production, therefore, dividing engines of extraordinary trueness and delicacy were required, and in the construction of such machines Rowland&#x27;s engineering skill brought him conspicuous success. The results of his labors may be found in the elaborate &quot;Photographic Map of the Normal Solar Spectrum&quot; (1888) and the &quot;Table of Solar Wave-Lengths&quot; (1898).

In his later years, Rowland was engaged in developing a system of multiplex telegraphy. He authored &quot;A Plea for Pure Science&quot;, in 1883 an important document for the understanding of the relationship between science in university and in commercial contexts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

==Honors and awards==
Rowland was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1876. The National Academy of Sciences, of which Rowland was a member, awarded him the Henry Draper Medal in 1890 for his contributions to astrophysics. He won the Matteucci Medal in 1895. In 1896, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Also, the Henry August Rowland House in Baltimore was designated a National Historic Landmark.

<doc id="747122" wikidata="Q1501882" url="?curid=747122" title="Generalized linear model">
<text>In statistics, a generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a &quot;link function&quot; and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.

Generalized linear models were formulated by John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn as a way of unifying various other statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression. They proposed an iteratively reweighted least squares method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters. MLE remains popular and is the default method on many statistical computing packages. Other approaches, including Bayesian regression and least squares fitting to variance stabilized responses, have been developed.

==Intuition==
Ordinary linear regression predicts the expected value of a given unknown quantity (the &quot;response variable&quot;, a random variable) as a linear combination of a set of observed values (&quot;predictors&quot;). This implies that a constant change in a predictor leads to a constant change in the response variable (i.e. a &quot;linear-response model&quot;). This is appropriate when the response variable can vary, to a good approximation, indefinitely in either direction, or more generally for any quantity that only varies by a relatively small amount compared to the variation in the predictive variables, e.g. human heights.

However, these assumptions are inappropriate for some types of response variables. For example, in cases where the response variable is expected to be always positive and varying over a wide range, constant input changes lead to geometrically (i.e. exponentially) varying, rather than constantly varying, output changes. As an example, suppose a linear prediction model learns from some data (perhaps primarily drawn from large beaches) that a 10 degree temperature decrease would lead to 1,000 fewer people visiting the beach. This model is unlikely to generalize well over different sized beaches. More specifically, the problem is that if you use the model to predict the new attendance with a temperature drop of 10 for a beach that regularly receives 50 beachgoers, you would predict an impossible attendance value of −950. Logically, a more realistic model would instead predict a constant &quot;rate&quot; of increased beach attendance (e.g. an increase of 10 degrees leads to a doubling in beach attendance, and a drop of 10 degrees leads to a halving in attendance). Such a model is termed an &quot;exponential-response model&quot; (or &quot;log-linear model&quot;, since the logarithm of the response is predicted to vary linearly).

Similarly, a model that predicts a probability of making a yes/no choice (a Bernoulli variable) is even less suitable as a linear-response model, since probabilities are bounded on both ends (they must be between 0 and 1). Imagine, for example, a model that predicts the likelihood of a given person going to the beach as a function of temperature. A reasonable model might predict, for example, that a change in 10 degrees makes a person two times more or less likely to go to the beach. But what does &quot;twice as likely&quot; mean in terms of a probability? It cannot literally mean to double the probability value (e.g. 50% becomes 100%, 75% becomes 150%, etc.). Rather, it is the &quot;odds&quot; that are doubling: from 2:1 odds, to 4:1 odds, to 8:1 odds, etc. Such a model is a &quot;log-odds or logistic model&quot;.

Generalized linear models cover all these situations by allowing for response variables that have arbitrary distributions (rather than simply normal distributions), and for an arbitrary function of the response variable (the &quot;link function&quot;) to vary linearly with the predictors (rather than assuming that the response itself must vary linearly). For example, the case above of predicted number of beach attendees would typically be modeled with a Poisson distribution and a log link, while the case of predicted probability of beach attendance would typically be modelled with a Bernoulli distribution (or binomial distribution, depending on exactly how the problem is phrased) and a log-odds (or &quot;logit&quot;) link function.

==Overview==

In a generalized linear model (GLM), each outcome Y of the dependent variables is assumed to be generated from a particular distribution in an exponential family, a large class of probability distributions that includes the normal, binomial, Poisson and gamma distributions, among others. The conditional mean μ of the distribution depends on the independent variables X through:

: formula_1

where E(Y | X) is the expected value of Y conditional on X; X&quot;β is the &quot;linear predictor&quot;, a linear combination of unknown parameters β&quot;; &quot;g&quot; is the link function.

In this framework, the variance is typically a function, V, of the mean:

:formula_2

It is convenient if V follows from an exponential family of distributions, but it may simply be that the variance is a function of the predicted value.

The unknown parameters, β, are typically estimated with maximum likelihood, maximum quasi-likelihood, or Bayesian techniques.

== Model components ==

The GLM consists of three elements:
: 1. A particular distribution for modeling formula_3 from among those which are considered exponential families of probability distributions,
: 2. A linear predictor formula_4, and
: 3. A link function formula_5 such that formula_6.

=== Probability distribution ===
An overdispersed exponential family of distributions is a generalization of an exponential family and the exponential dispersion model of distributions and includes those families of probability distributions, parameterized by formula_7 and formula_8, whose density functions &quot;f&quot; (or probability mass function, for the case of a discrete distribution) can be expressed in the form
:formula_9

The &quot;dispersion parameter&quot;, formula_8, typically is known and is usually related to the variance of the distribution. The functions formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, and formula_15 are known. Many common distributions are in this family, including the normal, exponential, gamma, Poisson, Bernoulli, and (for fixed number of trials) binomial, multinomial, and negative binomial.

For scalar formula_16 and formula_7 (denoted formula_18 and formula_19 in this case), this reduces to
: formula_20

formula_7 is related to the mean of the distribution. If formula_12 is the identity function, then the distribution is said to be in canonical form (or &quot;natural form&quot;). Note that any distribution can be converted to canonical form by rewriting formula_7 as formula_24 and then applying the transformation formula_25. It is always possible to convert formula_14 in terms of the new parametrization, even if formula_27 is not a one-to-one function; see comments in the page on exponential families. 

If, in addition, formula_13 and formula_12 are the identity, then formula_7 is called the &quot;canonical parameter&quot; (or &quot;natural parameter&quot;) and is related to the mean through
:formula_31

For scalar formula_16 and formula_7, this reduces to
:formula_34

Under this scenario, the variance of the distribution can be shown to be
:formula_35

For scalar formula_16 and formula_7, this reduces to
:formula_38

=== Linear predictor ===

The linear predictor is the quantity which incorporates the information about the independent variables into the model. The symbol &quot;η&quot; (Greek &quot;eta&quot;) denotes a linear predictor. It is related to the expected value of the data through the link function.

&quot;η&quot; is expressed as linear combinations (thus, &quot;linear&quot;) of unknown parameters β. The coefficients of the linear combination are represented as the matrix of independent variables X. &quot;η&quot; can thus be expressed as

:formula_39

=== Link function ===

The link function provides the relationship between the linear predictor and the mean of the distribution function. There are many commonly used link functions, and their choice is informed by several considerations. There is always a well-defined &quot;canonical&quot; link function which is derived from the exponential of the response&#x27;s density function. However, in some cases it makes sense to try to match the domain of the link function to the range of the distribution function&#x27;s mean, or use a non-canonical link function for algorithmic purposes, for example Bayesian probit regression.

When using a distribution function with a canonical parameter formula_40 the canonical link function is the function that expresses formula_19 in terms of formula_42 i.e. formula_43 For the most common distributions, the mean formula_44 is one of the parameters in the standard form of the distribution&#x27;s density function, and then formula_45 is the function as defined above that maps the density function into its canonical form. When using the canonical link function, formula_46 which allows formula_47 to be a sufficient statistic for formula_48.

Following is a table of several exponential-family distributions in common use and the data they are typically used for, along with the canonical link functions and their inverses (sometimes referred to as the mean function, as done here).

In the cases of the exponential and gamma distributions, the domain of the canonical link function is not the same as the permitted range of the mean. In particular, the linear predictor may be positive, which would give an impossible negative mean. When maximizing the likelihood, precautions must be taken to avoid this. An alternative is to use a noncanonical link function.

In the case of the Bernoulli, binomial, categorical and multinomial distributions, the support of the distributions is not the same type of data as the parameter being predicted. In all of these cases, the predicted parameter is one or more probabilities, i.e. real numbers in the range formula_49. The resulting model is known as &quot;logistic regression&quot; (or &quot;multinomial logistic regression&quot; in the case that &quot;K&quot;-way rather than binary values are being predicted).

For the Bernoulli and binomial distributions, the parameter is a single probability, indicating the likelihood of occurrence of a single event. The Bernoulli still satisfies the basic condition of the generalized linear model in that, even though a single outcome will always be either 0 or 1, the &quot;expected value&quot; will nonetheless be a real-valued probability, i.e. the probability of occurrence of a &quot;yes&quot; (or 1) outcome. Similarly, in a binomial distribution, the expected value is &quot;Np&quot;, i.e. the expected proportion of &quot;yes&quot; outcomes will be the probability to be predicted.

For categorical and multinomial distributions, the parameter to be predicted is a &quot;K&quot;-vector of probabilities, with the further restriction that all probabilities must add up to 1. Each probability indicates the likelihood of occurrence of one of the &quot;K&quot; possible values. For the multinomial distribution, and for the vector form of the categorical distribution, the expected values of the elements of the vector can be related to the predicted probabilities similarly to the binomial and Bernoulli distributions.

== Fitting ==
=== Maximum likelihood ===
The maximum likelihood estimates can be found using an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm or a Newton&#x27;s method with updates of the form:
: formula_50

where formula_51 is the observed information matrix (the negative of the Hessian matrix) and formula_52 is the score function; or a Fisher&#x27;s scoring method:
: formula_53

where formula_54 is the Fisher information matrix. Note that if the canonical link function is used, then they are the same.

=== Bayesian methods ===
In general, the posterior distribution cannot be found in closed form and so must be approximated, usually using Laplace approximations or some type of Markov chain Monte Carlo method such as Gibbs sampling.

== Examples ==

=== General linear models ===
A possible point of confusion has to do with the distinction between generalized linear models and general linear models, two broad statistical models. Co-originator John Nelder has expressed regret over this terminology.

The general linear model may be viewed as a special case of the generalized linear model with identity link and responses normally distributed. As most exact results of interest are obtained only for the general linear model, the general linear model has undergone a somewhat longer historical development. Results for the generalized linear model with non-identity link are asymptotic (tending to work well with large samples).

=== Linear regression ===

A simple, very important example of a generalized linear model (also an example of a general linear model) is linear regression. In linear regression, the use of the least-squares estimator is justified by the Gauss–Markov theorem, which does not assume that the distribution is normal.

From the perspective of generalized linear models, however, it is useful to suppose that the distribution function is the normal distribution with constant variance and the link function is the identity, which is the canonical link if the variance is known. Under these assumptions, the least-squares estimator is obtained as the maximum-likelihood parameter estimate.

For the normal distribution, the generalized linear model has a closed form expression for the maximum-likelihood estimates, which is convenient. Most other GLMs lack closed form estimates.

=== Binary data ===

When the response data, &quot;Y&quot;, are binary (taking on only values 0 and 1), the distribution function is generally chosen to be the Bernoulli distribution and the interpretation of &quot;μ&quot;i is then the probability, &quot;p&quot;, of &quot;Y&quot;i taking on the value one.

There are several popular link functions for binomial functions.

==== Logit link function ====
The most typical link function is the canonical logit link:

:formula_55

GLMs with this setup are logistic regression models (or &quot;logit models&quot;).

==== Probit link function as popular choice of inverse cumulative distribution function ====
Alternatively, the inverse of any continuous cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be used for the link since the CDF&#x27;s range is formula_49, the range of the binomial mean. The normal CDF formula_57 is a popular choice and yields the probit model. Its link is

:formula_58

The reason for the use of the probit model is that a constant scaling of the input variable to a normal CDF (which can be absorbed through equivalent scaling of all of the parameters) yields a function that is practically identical to the logit function, but probit models are more tractable in some situations than logit models. (In a Bayesian setting in which normally distributed prior distributions are placed on the parameters, the relationship between the normal priors and the normal CDF link function means that a probit model can be computed using Gibbs sampling, while a logit model generally cannot.)

==== Complementary log-log (cloglog) ====
The complementary log-log function may also be used:
:formula_59
This link function is asymmetric and will often produce different results from the logit and probit link functions. The cloglog model corresponds to applications where we observe either zero events (e.g., defects) or one or more, where the number of events is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution. The Poisson assumption means that

:formula_60

where &quot;μ&quot; is a positive number denoting the expected number of events. If &quot;p&quot; represents the proportion of observations with at least one event, its complement

:formula_61

and then

:formula_62

A linear model requires the response variable to take values over the entire real line. Since &quot;μ&quot; must be positive, we can enforce that by taking the logarithm, and letting log(&quot;μ&quot;) be a linear model. This produces the &quot;cloglog&quot; transformation

:formula_63

==== Identity link ====
The identity link &quot;g(p) = p&quot; is also sometimes used for binomial data to yield a linear probability model. However, the identity link can predict nonsense &quot;probabilities&quot; less than zero or greater than one. This can be avoided by using a transformation like cloglog, probit or logit (or any inverse cumulative distribution function). A primary merit of the identity link is that it can be estimated using linear math—and other standard link functions are approximately linear matching the identity link near &quot;p&quot; = 0.5.

==== Variance function ====
The variance function for &quot;&quot; data is:

:formula_64

where the dispersion parameter &quot;τ&quot; is exactly 1 for the binomial distribution. Indeed, the standard binomial likelihood omits &quot;τ&quot;. When it is present, the model is called &quot;quasibinomial&quot;, and the modified likelihood is called a quasi-likelihood, since it is not generally the likelihood corresponding to any real family of probability distributions. If &quot;τ&quot; exceeds 1, the model is said to exhibit overdispersion.

===Multinomial regression===
The binomial case may be easily extended to allow for a multinomial distribution as the response (also, a Generalized Linear Model for counts, with a constrained total). There are two ways in which this is usually done:

====Ordered response====
If the response variable is ordinal, then one may fit a model function of the form:

:formula_65

for &quot;m&quot; &gt; 2. Different links &quot;g&quot; lead to ordinal regression models like proportional odds models or ordered probit models.

====Unordered response====
If the response variable is a nominal measurement, or the data do not satisfy the assumptions of an ordered model, one may fit a model of the following form:

:formula_66

for &quot;m&quot; &gt; 2. Different links &quot;g&quot; lead to multinomial logit or multinomial probit models. These are more general than the ordered response models, and more parameters are estimated.

===Count data===
Another example of generalized linear models includes Poisson regression which models count data using the Poisson distribution. The link is typically the logarithm, the canonical link.

The variance function is proportional to the mean

:formula_67

where the dispersion parameter &quot;τ&quot; is typically fixed at exactly one. When it is not, the resulting quasi-likelihood model is often described as Poisson with overdispersion or &quot;quasi-Poisson&quot;.

== Extensions ==
=== Correlated or clustered data ===
The standard GLM assumes that the observations are uncorrelated. Extensions have been developed to allow for correlation between observations, as occurs for example in longitudinal studies and clustered designs:
* Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) allow for the correlation between observations without the use of an explicit probability model for the origin of the correlations, so there is no explicit likelihood. They are suitable when the random effects and their variances are not of inherent interest, as they allow for the correlation without explaining its origin. The focus is on estimating the average response over the population (&quot;population-averaged&quot; effects) rather than the regression parameters that would enable prediction of the effect of changing one or more components of X on a given individual. GEEs are usually used in conjunction with Huber–White standard errors.
* Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are an extension to GLMs that includes random effects in the linear predictor, giving an explicit probability model that explains the origin of the correlations. The resulting &quot;subject-specific&quot; parameter estimates are suitable when the focus is on estimating the effect of changing one or more components of X on a given individual. GLMMs are also referred to as multilevel models and as mixed model. In general, fitting GLMMs is more computationally complex and intensive than fitting GEEs.

=== Generalized additive models ===
Generalized additive models (GAMs) are another extension to GLMs in which the linear predictor &quot;η&quot; is not restricted to be linear in the covariates X but is the sum of smoothing functions applied to the &quot;xi&quot;s:
: formula_68

The smoothing functions &quot;fi&quot; are estimated from the data. In general this requires a large number of data points and is computationally intensive.

<doc id="747128" wikidata="Q1305062" url="?curid=747128" title="Granule (cell biology)">
<text>In cell biology, a granule is a small particle barely visible by light microscopy. The term is most often used to describe a secretory vesicle containing important components of cell physiology. Examples of granules include granulocytes, platelet granules, insulin granules, germane granules, starch granules, and stress granules.

== In leukocytes ==
A group of leukocytes, called granulocytes, are white blood cells containing enzyme granules that play a significant role in the immune system. Granulocytes include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils which attack bacteria or parasites, and respond to allergens. Each type of granulocyte contains enzymes and chemicals tailored to its function.

Neutrophils for example, contain primary granules, secondary granules, tertiary granules, and secretory vesicles. Primary vesicles, also known as azurophilic granules, secrete hydrolytic enzymes including elastase, myeloperoxidase, cathepsins, and defensins that aid in pathogen distruction. Secondary granules, or specific granules, in neutrophils contain iron-binding protein lactoferrin. Tertiary granules contain matrix metalloproteinases. 

Other immune cells, such as natural killer cells, contain granular enzymes, including perforin and proteases which can lead to the lysis of neighboring cells.  

The process by which granule contents are released is known as degranulation. This tightly controlled process is initiated by immunological stimuli and results in the movement of granules to the cell membrane for fusion and release.

== In platelets ==
The granules of platelets are classified as dense granules and alpha granules.

α-Granules are unique to platelets and are the most abundant of the platelet granules, numbering 50–80 per platelet 2. These granules measure 200–500 nm in diameter and account for about 10% of platelet volume. They contain mainly proteins, both membrane-associated receptors (for example, αIIbβ3 and P-selectin) and soluble cargo (for example, platelet factor 4 [PF4] and fibrinogen). Proteomic studies have identified more than 300 soluble proteins that are involved in a wide variety of functions, including hemostasis (for example, von Willebrand factor [VWF] and factor V), inflammation (for example, chemokines such as CXCL1 and interleukin-8), and wound healing (for example, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and fibroblast growth factor [FGF]) 3. The classic representation of α-granules as spherical organelles with a peripheral limiting membrane, a dense nucleoid, and progressively lucent peripheral zones on transmission electron microscopy is probably simplistic and may be in part a preparation artifact. Electron tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction of platelets is notable for a significant percentage of tubular α-granules that generally lack VWF 4. More recent work using transmission electron microscopy and freeze substitution dehydration of resting platelets shows that α-granules are ovoid with a generally homogeneous matrix and that tubes form from α-granules upon activation 5. Thus, whether or not there exists significant structural heterogeneity among α-granules remains to be completely resolved. α-Granule exocytosis is evaluated primarily by plasma membrane expression of P-selectin (CD62P) by flow cytometry or estimation of the release of PF4, VWF, or other granule cargos.

Dense granules (also known as δ-granules) are the second most abundant platelet granules, with 3–8 per platelet. They measure about 150 nm in diameter 2. These granules, unique to the platelets, are a subtype of lysosome-related organelles (LROs), a group that also includes melanosomes, lamellar bodies of the type II alveolar cells, and lytic granules of cytotoxic T cells. Dense granules mainly contain bioactive amines (for example, serotonin and histamine), adenine nucleotides, polyphosphates, and pyrophosphates as well as high concentrations of cations, particularly calcium. These granules derive their name from their electron-dense appearance on whole mount electron microscopy, which results from their high cation concentrations . Dense granule exocytosis is typically evaluated by ADP/ATP release by using luciferase-based luminescence techniques, release of preloaded [ 3H] serotonin, or membrane expression of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) or CD63 by flow cytometry.

Other platelet granules have been described. Platelets contain about 1–3 lysosomes per platelet and peroxisomes, the platelet-specific function of which remains unclear. Lysosomal exocytosis is typically evaluated by estimation of released lysosomal enzymes such as beta hexosaminidase. An electron-dense granule defined by the presence of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), termed the T granule, has also been described, although its existence remains controversial. PDI and other platelet-borne thiol isomerases have been reported to be packaged within a non-granular compartment derived from the megakaryocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which may be associated with the dense tubular system.

== In beta cells (insulin) ==
Insulin granules are a specific type of granule found in pancreatic beta cells. Insulin granules are secretory granules, which are responsible for the storage and secretion of insulin, a hormone that regulates the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream to maintain homeostasis. The release of insulin by granules is signaled by plasma glucose concentrations and the resultant influx of calcium ions in pancreatic cells, which initiate granule exocytosis. Insulin release is biphastic, as insulin is first released in the primary phase by granules closest to the plasma membrane. In the secondary phase, insulin granules are recruited from reserves deeper in the beta cell for a slower release rate.

Insulin granules undergo a significant maturation process. First, precursor proinsulin molecules are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and packaged in the golgi network. Insulin granules bud from the trans golgi network and are further sorted via clathrin-coated vesicle transport. After budding, insulin secretory granules are acidified, activating endoproteases PC1/3 and PC2 to convert proinsulin into insulin. The clatherin coating is released and the insulin secretory granules are transported across the cell via actin filaments and microtubules.

== In germline cells ==
In 1957, André and Rouiller first coined the term &quot;nuage&quot;. (French for &quot;cloud&quot;). Its amorphous and fibrous structure occurred in drawings as early as in 1933 (Risley). Today, the nuage is accepted to represent a characteristic, electrondense germ plasm organelle encapsulating the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope of the cells destined to the germline fate. The same granular material is also known under various synonyms: &quot;dense bodies, mitochondrial clouds, yolk nuclei, Balbiani bodies, perinuclear P granules in Caenorhabditis elegans, germinal granules in Xenopus laevis, chromatoid bodies in mice, and polar granules in Drosophila&quot;. Molecularly, the &quot;nuage&quot; is a tightly interwoven network of differentially localized RNA-binding proteins, which in turn localize specific mRNA species for differential storage, asymmetric segregation (as needed for asymmetric cell division), differential splicing and/or translational control. The germline granules appear to be ancestral and universally conserved in the germlines of all metazoan phyla.

Many germline granule components are part of the piRNA pathway and function to repress transposable elements.

== In plants (starch) ==
Starch is an insoluble carbohydrate used for energy storage in plant cells. There are two forms of starch, transitionary starch and storage starch. Transitionary starch is synthesised via photosynthesis and found in photosythetic plant tissue cells, such as the leaves. Storage starch is reserved for longer periods of time and is found in non-photosynthetic tissue cells such as the roots or stem. Storage starch is utilized during germination or regrowth, or when energy demands exceed net energy production from photosynthesis. 

Starch is stored in granule form. Starch granules are composed of a crystalline structure of amylopectin and amylose. Amylopectin forms the structure of the starch granule, with branching and non branching A-chains, B-chains, and C-chains. Amylose fills in the gaps of the amylopectin structure. Under a microscope, starch granules look like concentric layers, referred to as “growth rings”. Starch granules also contain granule-bound starch synthase and amylopectin synthesizing enzymes. Notably, starch granules vary in size and morphology across plant tissues and species.

== In stress ==
Stress granules are composed of protein and RNA, and form from pools of mRNAs that have not started translation as a result of environmental conditions including oxidative stress, temperature, toxins, and osmotic pressure. Stress granules also contain translation initiation factors, RNA binding proteins (which account for 50% of the granule&#x27;s components), and non-RNA binding proteins. They are formed via protein-protein interactions between mRNA binding proteins and are influenced by protein methylation or phosphorylation. They contain a “core” with high concentrations of proteins and mRNA and a less-concentrated outer region. Stress granules are dynamic in structure, and can dock and exchange with p-bodies or the cytoplasm. They can also perform fusion and fission in the cytoplasm. 

Stress granule assembly is dependent upon the conditions of the cell. In yeast, stress granules form under conditions of high heat. Stress granules are of significance for their roles in mRNA localization, cell signaling pathways, and antiviral processes. Once disassembled, the RNA inside stress granules can go back to translation or be removed as cellular waste. Stress granules may provide protection for mRNA from interactions with the cytosol. Moreover, mutations that affect the formation or degradation of stress granules may contribute to neurodegenerative conditions such as ALS and FTLD. However, the effects of stress granules on cell physiology are still under study.

<text>Union Hall (), also Unionhall, is a small fishing village located in County Cork, Ireland, located on the west side of Glandore Harbour. Its nearest neighbour to the west is Castletownshend; to the east, Glandore village. It is approximately 10 kilometres south-east of Skibbereen. As of the 2016 census, 270 people were living in Union Hall.

A key source of employment in the area is fishing, and the pier has its own ice plant and fish processing factory run by Glenmar Shellfish Ltd. Tourism is also an economic driver, and among the area&#x27;s attractions are boat trips to view whales, dolphins and seals.

==Location and access==

The coastal village lies on a hill, and has a small harbour for small fishing boats and other small craft.

By road it is accessible over the narrow Poulgorm Bridge on the R597 regional road to Glandore, Rosscarbery and Leap. The bridge is only one lane wide, so traffic must wait for the bridge to be clear before crossing. The bridge was built c.1890, and featured in David Puttnam&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;War of the Buttons&quot;.

==History==
Archaeological sites in the immediate area include evidence of a number of ringforts, a souterrain and a lime kiln in Ballincolla townland. Also nearby are the remains of 13th century and 16th century O&#x27;Donovan castles at Castle Eyre (Listarkin townland) and Raheen Castle (Raheen townland).

The Irish name means &quot;rotten strand&quot;. An alternative is &quot;strand of sorrow&quot;. One tradition says the name originates from the blood split at a battle fought there in the early 16th century between O&#x27;Donovan septs of Clancahill and Sliocht Íomhair. The adjoining townland name Clontaff is likewise explained as &quot;battle meadow&quot;, although the official name is .

The English name &quot;Union Hall&quot; was originally that of a big house built and named after the Act of Union 1800 by William Somerville Limrick (or Limerick), a lieutenant colonel in the Madras Army of the East India Company. The house, later named Unionhall House, was burnt out by the Irish Republican Army in the Irish War of Independence. In July–August 1922, as part of the Irish Free State offensive of the Civil War, national army troops landed at the quay in Union Hall in order to outflank the local Republican forces.

In January 2012, the &quot;Tit Bonhomme&quot; fishing vessel sank near Glandore Harbour, and the people of Union Hall spent several weeks searching for the Irish and Egyptian sailors who died. They were presented with a People of the Year Award in September 2012.

==Amenities and tourism==
There is a supermarket and a fish shop in the village. There is also a post office and a number of bed and breakfasts.

Union Hall has a Roman Catholic church (built c.1832 and dedicated to St. Bridget) to the south of the village, and a Church of Ireland church close to the village centre (built c.1840).

The area around Union Hall is known for its hills, woodlands, rivers and islands. There are a number of small inlets, bays and beaches.

<text>Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree, CH (7 July 1871 – 7 October 1954) was an English sociological researcher, social reformer and industrialist. He is known in particular for his three studies of poverty in York, conducted in 1899, 1935, and 1951.

The first York study involved a comprehensive survey of the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class household, and his methodology inspired many subsequent researches in British empirical sociology.

By strictly defining the concept of poverty in his studies, he was able to reveal that the causes of poverty in York were more structural than moral, such as low wages, which went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.

==Life==
Seebohm Rowntree was born in York, the second son of the Quaker Joseph Rowntree, who had been a master grocer but was becoming a successful cocoa and chocolate manufacturer, and Emma Antoinette Seebohm. He was educated first privately and then from the age of 10 at Bootham School. Rowntree studied chemistry at Owen&#x27;s College, Manchester for five terms before joining the family firm in 1889, where he laid the foundations of the firm&#x27;s first chemistry department. He became the first Labour Director in 1897 when the firm became a limited liability company and was the chairman from 1923 to 1941. During the First World War he was Director of the Welfare Department at the Ministry of Munitions, under the leadership of David Lloyd George.

In 1897 he married Lydia Potter (1868/9–1944), daughter of Edwin Potter, an engineer; they had four sons and one daughter. After his wife died, he lived in a wing of Former Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s old house, Hughenden Manor, where he died after a heart attack in 1954. He was 83 years old.

==Work==

===First York study (1899)===

Rowntree investigated poverty in York, inspired by the work of his father Joseph Rowntree and the work of Charles Booth in London. He carried out a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class household. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals. The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book &quot;Poverty, A Study of Town Life&quot;.

In Rowntree&#x27;s work, he surveyed working-class families in York and drew a poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money &quot;necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life&quot; (quoted in Coates and Silburn, 1970). The money needed for this subsistence level of existence covered fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, household and personal items, adjusted according to family size. He determined this level using social scientific methods which had not been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading nutritionists of the period to discover the minimum calorific intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to find the cheapest prices in the area for purchasing the food required by this minimum diet and used this information to set his poverty line.

According to this measure, 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line. This result corresponded with that from Charles Booth&#x27;s study of poverty in London and so challenged the view, commonly held at the time, that abject poverty was a problem particular to London and was not widespread in the rest of Britain. Rowntree&#x27;s (1901) statistics have since been challenged by other sociological researchers such as Gazeley and Newell (2000) who argued he &quot;overestimated the needs of children relative to adults and did not allow for economies of scale&quot;, resulting in inflated measurement of primary poverty.

He placed those below his poverty line into two groups depending on the reason for their poverty. Those in primary poverty did not have enough income to meet the expenditure necessary for their basic needs. Those classed as in secondary poverty had high enough income to meet basic needs but some portion of this money was being spent elsewhere (such as on drink, gambling, and betting) and so they were unable to then afford the necessities of life.

Setting a primary poverty line for which &quot;[e]xpenditure needful for the development of the mortal, moral and social sides of human nature will not be taken into account&quot; (136) did not mean that he did not recognise the non-subsistence need of the working class. Rather, he wished to measure a type of poverty that could not be reduced simply by greater &quot;thrift&quot;, so as to cast off the contemporary social myth about poverty as one&#x27;s own fault. Ironically, this primary poverty line also helped many manufactures to set the lowest possible minimum wage, which engendered many criticisms toward him.

In analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives. This idea of poverty cycle captured important longitudinal aspects of poverty that were cited later in much other research.

===Second York study (1936)===
Rowntree conducted a further study of poverty in York in 1936 under the title &quot;Poverty and Progress&quot;. This was based largely on a similar research method as his earlier study and found absolute poverty among the working class in York had decreased by 50% since his first study. However, as he changed his definition of the poverty line, and so the measure of absolute poverty, it is not a direct comparison from his earlier study. In this study he included allowances for some items which were not strictly necessary for survival, these included newspapers, books, radios, beer, tobacco, holidays, and presents. His results showed that the causes of poverty had changed considerably in a few decades. In the 1890s, the major reason for primary poverty was low wages, 52%, whereas in the 1930s unemployment accounted for 44.53% and low wages only 10%. 
Despite the inclusion of the extra items, he found that the percentage of his sample population in poverty had dropped to 18 per cent in 1936 and to 1.5 per cent in 1950.

===Third York study (1951)===
Rowntree published a third study of York&#x27;s poverty in 1951 under the title &quot;Poverty and the Welfare State&quot; which was produced in collaboration with his research assistant G. R. Lavers. Unlike his other studies of York a sampling technique was used rather than a comprehensive survey, as he had primarily tested its viability in his second York study, though he did not adopt it in the previous time.

By the 1950s, it appeared that absolute poverty was a minor problem although poverty did remain, for example among the elderly, but it was believed that increased welfare benefits would soon eradicate this lingering poverty. The conquest of poverty was put down to an expanding economy as the 1950s were the years of the &#x27;affluent society&#x27;, to government policies of full employment, and to the success of the welfare state. It was widely believed that the operation of the welfare state had redistributed wealth from rich to poor and significantly raised working class living standards.

===Other writings===
David Lloyd George urged Rowntree to write on rural living conditions in Britain: &quot;The Land&quot; (1913) and &quot;How the Labourer Lives&quot; (1913) looked at the living conditions of farming families. Rowntree argued that an increase in landholdings would make agriculture more productive.

His work &quot;The Human Needs of Labour&quot; (1918) argued for family allowances and a national minimum wage, and in &quot;The Human Factor in Business&quot;, Rowntree argued that business owners should adopt more democratic practices like those at his own factory rather than more autocratic leadership styles. He expressed his conviction of the possibility of establishing a close-knit community including both the management and the workers.

In the study of his later period, &quot;English Life and Leisure: A Social Study&quot; (1951), he inquired into the ways people spent their relative, newly-found leisure and income; but this work suffered more conceptual difficulties than his former works.

==Influence==

===Liberal reforms===
Rowntree was a supporter of the Liberal Party and hoped that his work would influence Liberal politicians. Rowntree became close friends with David Lloyd George in 1907 after the two men met when Lloyd George was serving as President of the Board of Trade. The influence of Rowntree can be seen in the Liberal reforms passed by the Liberals when in power. He was a member of the Liberal Industrial Inquiry which published &quot;Britain&#x27;s Industrial Future&quot;, better known as the &quot;Yellow Book&quot;, in 1928. In 1930 he co-wrote, with Lloyd George and Philip Kerr, the Liberal Party&#x27;s plan &quot;How to Tackle Unemployment&quot;. In June 1936 he was elected to serve on the Liberal Party Council.

===Labour Party===
&quot;Poverty and Progress&quot; impacted on the policies of the post-war Labour government and &quot;Poverty and the Welfare State&quot; was used in a 1951 Labour party election manifesto headed Ending Poverty although this was without his knowledge.

==Industrialist and philanthropist==
Seebohm and the Rowntree&#x27;s firm broke new ground in terms of industrial relations, welfare and management. Lyndall Urwick describes him as &quot;the British management movement&#x27;s greatest pioneer&quot; in his book Golden Book of Management. Rowntree&#x27;s Quaker upbringing influenced his business practice; he believed that the existence of companies which paid low wages was bad for the &quot;nation&#x27;s economy and humanity&quot;. &quot;More a philanthropist than a capitalist&quot;, he introduced various reforms in the working condition of the workers: the establishment of the eight-hour day in 1896, a pension scheme in 1906, a five-day work week and work councils in 1919, the establishment of a psychology department in 1922, and a profit-sharing plan in 1923.

Rowntree was also personally involved in two major conciliation efforts following strikes in 1919 and 1926.

In 1947 when the British Institute of Management was created he became an Honorary Founder Member and in 1952 the first English person to become an Honorary Fellow of the institute.

==Rowntree&#x27;s Cocoa Works==
The Rowntree Cocoa Works was a site of great scientific investigation and became internationally known as such.

Rowntree was a great believer in trained specialists, and employed many at the Cocoa Works. They included Oliver Sheldon, Lyndall Urwick and Dr Clarence Northcott. The Works was a corporate member of the Taylor Society and was admired by its President Henry S. Dennison.

Seebohm oversaw the formation of an industrial psychology department in 1922 which pioneered the use of psychological recruitment tests in British industry. Employing psychologist Victor Moorrees who developed a new test, the form board selection test, to ascertain how well prospective employees would be able to fit chocolates into their box.

He was also heavily involved in the National Institute of Industrial Psychology serving on its executive committee from its foundation in 1921, as chairman from 1940 to 1947, until his resignation in 1949.

<doc id="747151" wikidata="Q784242" url="?curid=747151" title="Awards and decorations of the United States Armed Forces">
<text>Various medals, service ribbons, ribbon devices, and specific badges recognize military service and personal accomplishments of members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Such awards are a means to outwardly display the highlights of a service member&#x27;s career.

==U.S. military awards currently issued to service members==

===General order of precedence===
The precedence of particular awards will vary slightly among the different branches of service. All awards and decorations may be awarded to any service member unless otherwise designated by name or notation.

Note: The precedence of the Purple Heart was immediately before the Good Conduct Medals until changed to its current precedence in 1985.

===Military departments===
* Inter-service
* Army
* Navy and Marine Corps
* Air Force and Space Force
* Coast Guard

To denote additional achievements or multiple awards of the same decoration, the United States military maintains a number of award devices which are pinned to service ribbons and medals.

==Inactive and obsolete awards==
U.S. military personnel having received these awards have participated within these areas of combat/conflict during the time these awards were given to U.S. service members. Such awards have since been discontinued or are no longer applicable in terms of receiving these commendations. Certain decorations remain inactive at this time (e.g. National Defense Service Medal) but may be reactivated at a later date in the future.

===Discontinued or proposed===

The following decorations were designed for issuance with an approved medal, but were either never officially approved for presentation or were discontinued before a first award could be made.

===Single service awards===

Single service awards were official military decorations created as one time awards to recognize a single event. The first such single service award was issued during the Spanish–American War by the Revenue Cutter Service to honor the actions of the vessel USRC &quot;Hudson&quot; during the Battle of Cárdenas. The last single service award was issued in 1960 when Congress authorized the awarding of the Four Chaplains&#x27; Medal recognizing the Four Chaplains who died together during World War II. There have been no single service awards issued since by the U.S. military, mainly due to the decline and complications of awarding commemorative service medals.

===Unofficial decorations===

Unofficial decorations are those military awards created and issued by local commanders. In most cases, unofficial awards were designed to commemorate a specific battle or engagement of a commander&#x27;s unit. The most well known unofficial awards were issued during the American Civil War.

After the Civil War, stricter military regulations prohibited local commanders from issuing awards and the practice had fallen into disuse by the 20th century. Even so, the Department of Defense has stated that large numbers of unofficial medals were privately issued to members of the Armed Forces of the United States for many years after the Civil War, mostly to commemorate specific battles, events, or as private veteran memorabilia. One of the more well known is the Walter Reed Medal (recognized today as a Congressional Gold Medal), awarded for exploratory scientific achievement in the field of malaria treatment. While presented as a gold medallion, members of the military were reported to wear a red ribbon on their uniforms to denote the decoration.

==Foreign and international awards==
Foreign and international decorations are authorized for wear on United States military uniforms by the Department of Defense in accordance with established regulations for the receipt of such awards as outlined by the State Department. In the case of foreign decorations, the awards may be divided into senior service decorations (awarded only to high ranking U.S. officers), heroic decorations for valor, and foreign service decorations.

There are hundreds of foreign and international awards which have been approved for issuance to United States military personnel since World War I, the following being among the more common.

During the First and Second World Wars, the medals of France and Belgium, as well as the French Military Medal and Luxembourg War Cross, were further issued as unit citation cords, known as &quot;Fourragère&quot;. Service members could receive both the individual award and the unit cord; in the case of the later, the unit citation could either be worn temporarily while a member of the unit or permanently if the service member was present during the actual battle which warranted the unit citation. A further unit citation cord of the Order of William of the Netherlands was also issued during World War II, and was far more commonly known as the &quot;Orange Lanyard&quot;.

As of 2002, South Korea has again issued the Korean Presidential Unit Citation to certain units of the United States Marine Corps, thus placing this previously obsolete foreign award back on the active order of precedence for U.S. decorations. Apart from this one decoration, most 21st century foreign military awards are reserved for only the most senior flag and general officers and then only presented as &quot;end of tour&quot; decorations upon transfer from a major command.

<doc id="747152" wikidata="Q509713" url="?curid=747152" title="Desert rose (crystal)">
<text>A desert rose is an intricate rose-like formation of crystal clusters of gypsum or baryte, which include abundant sand grains. The &quot;petals&quot; are crystals flattened on the &quot;c&quot; axis, fanning open in radiating clusters.

The rosette crystal habit tends to occur when the crystals form in arid sandy conditions, such as the evaporation of a shallow salt basin. The crystals form a circular array of flat plates, giving the rock a shape similar to a rose blossom. Gypsum roses usually have better defined, sharper edges than baryte roses. Celestine and other bladed evaporite minerals may also form rosette clusters. They can appear either as a single rose-like bloom or as clusters of blooms, typically ranging from pea-sized to in diameter.

The ambient sand that is incorporated into the crystal structure, or otherwise encrusts the crystals, varies with the local environment. If iron oxides are present, the rosettes take on a rusty tone.

The desert rose may also be known by the names: sand rose, Sahara rose, rose rock, selenite rose, gypsum rose and baryte (barite) rose.

==Locations==

===Sahara===
Sand roses are found in large numbers in surroundings of the salt lake of Chott el Djerid in South-West Tunisia, as well as the neighboring regions in Algeria and Ghadames, Libya. Local inhabitants extract them and sell them as souvenirs to tourists, creating a sustainable income for the local population. Other sandroses are found elsewhere in the Sahara, but those extracted in the surroundings of the Salt Lake are particularly beautiful because of the high percentage of salt in their composition making them more crystalline and luminous. Others that contain more sand have a rusty tone, hence less brilliant in day or artificial light. Sand roses are also found in the vicinity of Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia.

===Oklahoma===
Rose rock in Oklahoma was formed during the Permian Period, 250 million years ago, when western and central Oklahoma was covered by a shallow sea. As the sea retreated, baryte precipitated out of the water and crystallized around grains of quartz sand. This left behind large formation of reddish sandstone, locally called Garber Sandstone, containing deposits of rose rock.

The rose rock was selected as the official rock of the US state of Oklahoma in 1968.

==Size==
Typically, desert roses measure from in diameter. The largest recorded by the Oklahoma Geological Survey was across and high, weighing . Clusters of rose rocks up to tall and weighing more than have been found.

<doc id="747154" wikidata="Q211818" url="?curid=747154" title="Belvedere, Vienna">
<text>The Belvedere is a historic building complex in Vienna, Austria consisting of two Baroque palaces (the Upper and Lower Belvedere), the Orangery, and the Palace Stables. The buildings are set in a Baroque park landscape in the third district of the city, on the south-eastern edge of its centre. It currently houses the Belvedere museum known in German as the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere (in English, referred to both as the Belvedere Museum and Austrian Gallery). The grounds are set on a gentle gradient and include decorative tiered fountains and cascades, Baroque sculptures, and majestic wrought iron gates. The Baroque palace complex was built as a summer residence for Prince Eugene of Savoy.

The Belvedere was built during a period of extensive construction in Vienna, which at the time was both the imperial capital and home to the ruling Habsburg dynasty. This period of prosperity followed on from the commander-in-chief Prince Eugene of Savoy&#x27;s successful conclusion of a series of wars against the Ottoman Empire.

== Lower Belvedere ==

On 30 November 1697, one year after commencing with the construction of the Stadtpalais, Prince Eugene purchased a sizable plot of land south of the Rennweg, the main road to Hungary. Plans for the Belvedere garden complex were drawn up immediately. The prince chose Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt as the chief architect for this project rather than Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, the creator of his Stadtpalais. Hildebrandt (1668–1745), whom the general had met whilst engaged in a military campaign in Piedmont, had already built Ráckeve Palace for him in 1702 on Csepel, an island in the Danube River south of Budapest. He later went on to build numerous other edifices in his service. The architect had studied civil engineering in Rome under Carlo Fontana and had gone into imperial service in 1695–96 in order to learn how to build fortifications. From 1696 onwards, records show that he was employed as a court architect in Vienna. As well as the Belvedere, Hildebrandt&#x27;s most outstanding achievements include the Schloss Hof Palace, which was also commissioned by Prince Eugene, the Schwarzenberg Palace (formerly known as the Mansfeld–Fondi Palace), the Kinsky Palace, as well as the entire Göttweig Monastery estate in the Wachau Valley.

At the time that the prince was planning to buy the land on the outskirts of Vienna for his Belvedere project, the area was completely undeveloped – an ideal place to construct a landscaped garden and summer palace. However, a month before the prince made his acquisition, the imperial Grand Marshal Count Heinrich Franz von Mansfeld, Prince of Fondi, purchased the neighboring plot and commissioned Hildebrandt to build a garden palace on the land. To buy the plot, Prince Eugene was forced to take out a large loan secured against his Stadtpalais, which was still in the process of being built. He bought additional neighboring areas of land in 1708, 1716, and again in 1717–18 to allow him to expand the garden in stages.

Records indicate that the construction of the Lower Belvedere had started by 1712, as Prince Eugene submitted the request for a building inspection on 5 July 1713. Work proceeded swiftly, and Marcantonio Chiarini from Bologna started painting the quadratura in the central hall in 1715. The ambassador from the Spanish Flanders visited the Lower Belvedere, as well as the Stadtpalais, in April 1716. Extensive work was carried out on the grounds at the same time as construction went ahead on the Lustschloss, as the Lower Belvedere was described on an early cityscape. Dominique Girard changed the plans for the garden significantly between January and May 1717, so that it could be completed by the following summer. Girard, who was employed as fontainier du roi, or the king&#x27;s water engineer, in Versailles from 1707 to 1715, had started working as a garden inspector for the Bavarian elector Maximilian Emanuel from 1715 onwards. It was on the latter&#x27;s recommendation that he entered Prince Eugene&#x27;s employ. The statuary for the balustrade is the best known work of Giovanni Stanetti.

== Gardens ==

The Belvedere Gardens were designed in the formal French manner with clipped hedges, gravelled walks and &quot;jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; by Dominique Girard who trained in the gardens of Versailles as a pupil of André Le Nôtre. Extensive mythological references throughout the gardens allude to the rise of Prince Eugene with a sculptural program linking him to the god Apollo. A great water basin in the upper parterre and the stairs and cascades peopled by nymphs and goddesses that links upper and lower parterres survive, but the patterned bedding has long been grassed over; it is currently being restored.

The painting &quot;View of Vienna from the Belvedere&quot; by Bernardo Bellotto depicts a famous perspective of the city center of Vienna called the Canaletto Blick. This view as seen from the Upper Belvedere Palace with the Gardens in the foreground still plays a significant role in urban planning discussions when it comes to altering the skyline of the historic city center.

== Upper Belvedere ==

The construction of the Upper Belvedere began as early as 1717, as testified by two letters that Prince Eugene sent from Belgrade to his servant Benedetti in summer 1718, describing the progress of work on the palace. Construction was so far advanced by 2 October 1719 that the prince was able to receive the Turkish ambassador Ibrahim Pasha there. The decoration of the interior began as early as 1718. In 1719 he commissioned the Italian painter Francesco Solimena to execute both the altarpiece for the Palace Chapel and the ceiling fresco in the Golden Room. In the same year Gaetano Fanti was commissioned to execute the illusionistic quadratura painting in the Marble Hall. In 1720 Carlo Carlone was entrusted with the task of painting the ceiling fresco in the Marble Hall, which he executed from 1721 to 1723.

The building was finished in 1723. The &quot;Sala Terrena&quot;, however, was at risk of collapsing due to structural problems, and in the winter of 1732–33 Hildebrandt was forced to install a vaulted ceiling supported by four Atlas pillars, giving the room its current appearance. Salomon Kleiner, an engineer from the Mainz elector&#x27;s court, produced a ten-part publication between 1731 and 1740 containing a total of ninety plates, entitled &quot;Wunder würdiges Kriegs- und Siegs-Lager deß Unvergleichlichen Heldens Unserer Zeiten Eugenii Francisci Hertzogen zu Savoyen und Piemont&quot; (&quot;Wondrous war and victory encampment of the supreme hero of our age Eugene Francis Duke of Savoy and Piedmont&quot;), which documented in precise detail the state of the Belvedere complex.

The Upper Belvedere appears on the 20-cent Austrian euro coin.

== After the death of Prince Eugene ==

When Prince Eugene died in his City Palace in Vienna on 21 April 1736, he did not leave a legally binding will. A commission set up by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI named the prince&#x27;s niece Victoria as his heir. She was the daughter of his eldest brother Thomas and the only surviving member of the house of Savoy-Soissons. Princess Victoria moved into the Belvedere, known at that point as the Gartenpalais, on 6 July 1736, but immediately made clear that she was not interested in her inheritance and aimed to auction off the palace complex as soon as possible. On 15 April 1738, she married Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1702–87), who was several years her junior, in the presence of the royal family in the Schlosshof in the Marchfeld region, Lower Austria. Her choice of husband proved an unfortunate one, however, and the poorly-matched couple divorced in 1744. Yet it was only when Princess Victoria finally decided to leave Vienna and return to her home city of Turin, Italy, eight years later that Maria Theresa, the daughter of Charles VI, was able to purchase the estate.

The imperial couple never moved into the Gartenpalais, which was first described as the Belvedere in their sales contract of November 1752. The complex was somewhat eclipsed by the other imperial palaces, and at first the buildings were left unused. Maria Theresa later created an ancestors&#x27; gallery of the Habsburg dynasty in the Lower Belvedere, as was the custom in all other palaces belonging to the imperial family. The palace was only once awakened from its slumbers in 1770 when a masked ball was staged there on 17 April to mark the occasion of the Imperial Princess Maria Antonia&#x27;s marriage with the French Dauphin, who was later to become Louis XVI. The Lord High Chamberlain Prince Johann Joseph Khevenhüller-Metsch and the court architect Nicolaus Pacassi were charged with taking care of the extensive preparations for the ball to which 16,000 guests were invited.
In 1776, Maria Theresa and her son, Emperor Joseph II decided to transfer the &quot;k.u.k. Gemäldegalerie&quot; (&quot;Imperial Picture Gallery&quot;) from the Imperial Stables – a part of the city&#x27;s Hofburg Imperial Palace – to the Upper Belvedere. Inspired by the idea of enlightened absolutism, the intention was to make the imperial collection accessible to the general public. The gallery opened five years later, making it one of the first public museums in the world. A series of eminent painters served as directors in charge of the imperial collection in the Upper Belvedere up to 1891 when it was transferred to the newly built Kunsthistorisches Museum (Museum of Fine Arts) on Vienna&#x27;s Ringstrasse.

While the Upper Belvedere was transformed into a picture gallery at the end of the eighteenth century, the Lower Belvedere served chiefly to house royal family members fleeing from the French Revolution. Most notably these included Princess Marie Thérèse Charlotte, the sole surviving child of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, and Archduke Ferdinand. Marie Thérèse Charlotte resided in the palace until her marriage with Prince Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, in 1799. Archduke Ferdinand, the former Governor of the Duchy of Milan up to 1796, went to live there after the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797.

After the Habsburg Monarchy was forced to cede Tyrol to Bavaria in the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, a new home had to be found for the imperial collection from Ambras Castle, near Innsbruck. At first, the collection was taken to Petrovaradin (now in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia) to protect it from looting by French troops. In 1811 Emperor Francis II decreed that it should be installed in the Lower Belvedere, which was, in fact, far too small for the collection. This part of the Belvedere thus also took on the function of a museum and had already started to draw considerable numbers of visitors by the time of the Congress of Vienna (1814–15).

Under the directorship of the Prefect of the Imperial Court Library, Moritz, Count of Dietrichstein-Proskau-Leslie, the Collection of Egyptian Antiquities and the Antiquities Room were added to the Ambras Collection in the Lower Belvedere collection from 1833 onwards. In 1844, the Roman milestones, which had been stored in the catacombs of the Theseus Temple up to that point, were relocated to an open-air location in the Privy Garden. Watercolors by Carl Goebel the Younger pay testimony to the Lower Belvedere&#x27;s beginnings as a museum, as does Joseph Bergmann&#x27;s descriptive guide to the collection that dates from 1846. This situation remained almost unchanged until the move to the newly built Kunsthistorisches Museum in the Ringstrasse in 1888–89.

== Belvedere and Franz Ferdinand ==
Following the relocation of the imperial collections, both of the Belvedere Palaces ceased to be public museums for a while at least. In 1896, Emperor Franz Joseph I decided that the Upper Belvedere should serve as a residence for the heir to the throne, his nephew Franz Ferdinand. The heir presumptive had the palace remodeled under the supervision of the architect Emil von Förster, who was also imperial undersecretary, and it served from that point onwards as Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s residence. By contrast, the Moderne Galerie was opened a few years later, on 2 May 1903, in the Lower Belvedere. The museum was the first state collection in Austria that was exclusively dedicated to modern art and came about upon the instigation of the Union of Austrian Artists, known as the Vienna Secession. The aim was to juxtapose Austrian art with international modernism. From the outset, major works by Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, and Giovanni Segantini were bought for the Moderne Galerie. The museum was renamed the &quot;k.u.k. Staatsgalerie&quot; (&quot;Imperial and Royal Gallery&quot;) in 1911 after it was decided to expand the focus beyond modern art to include works from earlier eras. The assassination of heir-apparent Franz Ferdinand and his wife, the outbreak of World War I, and the ensuing collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1918 marked the start of a new era for the Belvedere.

== Belvedere in the First and Second Republic ==

Shortly after the end of the war in November 1918, the art historian Franz Haberditzl submitted a request to the Ministry of Education, asking for the palaces to be left to the Staatsgalerie. This application was granted the very next year. The nationalization of the Belvedere palace complex was also laid down in the draft document to reorganize the former imperial collections drawn up by Hans Tietze in 1920–21. In addition to the museums that still exist today, it also included plans to set up an &quot;Österreichische Galerie&quot; (Austrian Gallery) and a &quot;Moderne Galerie&quot;. During the 1921–23 reorganization, the Baroque Museum in the Lower Belvedere was added to the existing museum ensemble. The Moderne Galerie was opened in the Orangery in 1929.
The palaces suffered considerable damage during World War II, with parts of the Marble Hall in the Upper Belvedere and the Hall of Grotesques in the Lower Belvedere destroyed by bombs. Postwar restoration extended from 1945 to 1953, during which time, in 1950, a major fire beginning in the Golden Chamber on the upper floor of Upper Belvedere destroyed several important rooms and works displayed there. On 4 February 1953, the Österreichische Galerie reopened, followed by the Baroque Museum. The &quot;Museum mittelalterlicher österreichischer Kunst&quot; (&quot;Museum of Medieval Austrian Art&quot;) opened in the Orangery on 5 December 1953.

In 1996, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) released a report citing inadequate postwar restorations that had left the &quot;sala terrena&quot; and grand staircase without &quot;much of their original character.&quot; That same year, it added the Belvedere Garden to the WMF Watch List to highlight &quot;the state of disrepair of the much-loved Viennese landmark.&quot; Multiple restoration plans emerged during the late 1990s to address these physical and aesthetic issues under a federal plan to modernize the nation&#x27;s museums, a program that returned the gardens to their original Baroque character and significantly renovated the &quot;sala terrena&quot; and grand staircase.

The Lower Belvedere and the Orangery have been specially adapted to stage special exhibitions. After winning an invitation-only competition, architect Susanne Zottl turned the Orangery into a modern exhibition hall whilst still preserving the building&#x27;s original Baroque fabric. This venue opened in March 2007 with the exhibition &quot;Gartenlust: Der Garten in der Kunst&quot; (&quot;Garden Pleasures: The Garden in Art&quot;). A few months later the Lower Belvedere reopened with the show Vienna – Paris. The redesign of the building was carried out by the Berlin architect Wilfried Kuehn, who moved the entrance back to its place in the cour d&#x27;honneur, thereby once more freeing up the original line of vision from the main gate of the Lower Belvedere via the Marble Hall to the garden facade of the Upper Belvedere. The various sections of the original orangeries annexed to the Marble Hall were returned to their original condition and now provide space for the new exhibition rooms. The magnificent Baroque state rooms – the Marble Gallery, the Golden Room, and the Hall of Grotesques – remain unchanged and are open to the public.

== Looting by the Nazi art controversies and restitutions ==
* On 26 August 1959, Holocaust survivor Alice Morgenstern filed a claim to the Finanzlandesdirektion für Wien, Niederösterreich und das Burgenland (Provincial Tax Office for Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland) in which she said, &quot;the picture &quot;Four Trees&quot; by Egon Schiele, which used to be owned by us, is now hanging in the Upper Belvedere. We never sold the picture but gave it to a friend, Robert Röhrl, lawyer in Vienna, Gumpendorferstrasse, for safekeeping. He unfortunately died, and I do not know how the picture landed in the nineteenth-century [recte twentieth-century] collection in the Belvedere&quot;. On 20 March 2020, the Austrian Advisory Commission recommended that the Schiele be restored to Morgenstern&#x27;s heirs.
* In November 2006, after more than five decades of legal disputes, a panel ruled that Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;Summer Night at the Beach&quot;, on display at Vienna&#x27;s Belvedere Gallery, was to be returned to Marina Fistoulari-Mahler, granddaughter and sole heir of Alma Mahler, wife of Austrian composer Gustav Mahler.
* In 2006, Austria returned five paintings by Gustav Klimt, from the Belvedere, to the heirs of Adele Bloch-Bauer.
*In 2006, the Austrian arbitration panel decided that the portrait of &quot;Amalie Zuckerkandl&quot; by Gustav Klimt was not looted by the Nazis and did not need to be restored. The decision caused much commentary, in part because Amalie Zuckerkandl perished with her daughter in Auschwitz and in part because, as MSNBC reported, &quot;Rather than return this obviously looted painting, an Austrian arbitration panel concluded that it should stay in the Belvedere.&quot;
*In 2012, a documentary &quot;Portrait of Wally&quot; told how Egon Schiele&#x27;s famous portrait, which had belonged to a Viennese art dealer named Lea Bondi until the Nazi Friedrich Welz confiscated it from her private collection in 1939, was returned by mistake to the Belvedere Museum in Austria after World War II as part of another dealer&#x27;s collection.
*In 2014, the Belvedere was ordered to restore &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Kitchen / Kitchen Interior&quot; by Wilhelm Leibl to the heirs of Martha Liebermann (Max Liebermann&#x27;s widow) due to Nazi persecution.

<doc id="747155" wikidata="Q223419" url="?curid=747155" title="Manuel Roxas">
<text>Manuel Acuña Roxas (; January 1, 1892 – April 15, 1948) was a Filipino lawyer and politician who served as the fifth president of the Philippines from 1946 until his death in 1948. He served briefly as the third and last President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from May 28, 1946, to July 4, 1946, and became the first President of the Independent Third Philippine Republic after the United States ceded its sovereignty over the Philippines.

==Early life and education==
Roxas was born on January 1, 1892, in Capiz, Capiz (present-day Roxas City) to Gerardo Roxas y Luis and Rosario Acuña y Villaruz. He was a posthumous child, as his father died after being mortally wounded by the Spanish Guardia Civil the year before. He and his older brother, Mamerto, were raised by their mother and her father, &quot;Don&quot; Eleuterio Acuña. His other siblings from his father included Leopoldo and Margarita, while he also had half-siblings, Consuelo, Leopoldo, Ines, and Evaristo Picazo after his mother remarried.

Roxas received his early education in the public schools of Capiz and attended St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Hong Kong at age 12, but due to homesickness, he went back to Capiz. He eventually transferred to Manila High School, graduating with honors in 1909.

Roxas began his law studies at a private law school established by George A. Malcolm, the first dean of the University of the Philippines College of Law. On his second year, he enrolled at University of the Philippines, where he was elected president of his class and the student council. In 1913, Roxas obtained his law degree, graduated class valedictorian, and subsequently topped the bar examinations with a grade of 92% that same year. He then became professor of law at the Philippine Law School and National University. He served as secretary to Judge Cayetano Arellano of the Supreme Court.

==Political career==

In 1917, Roxas became a member of the municipal council of Capiz, serving until 1919. He then became the youngest provincial governor of Capiz, and served in that capacity from 1919 to 1922.

Roxas was elected to the Philippine House of Representatives in 1922, and for twelve consecutive years was Speaker of the House. He served as a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1934, secretary of finance, chairman of the National Economic Council, chairman of the National Development Company, and served in many other government corporations and agencies. He also served as a brigadier general in the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), was a recognized guerrilla leader and military leader of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. Roxas became one of the leaders of the Nacionalista Party, which was dominated by the &quot;hacendado&quot; class who owned the vast &quot;hacienda&quot; estates that made up most of the cultivated land in the Philippines. The same &quot;hacendado&quot; elite who dominated the Philippines under Spanish rule continued to be the dominant social element under American rule. Roxas himself was a &quot;hacendado&quot;, who had used his wealth to further his political ambitions. The politics of the Philippines were characterized by a clientistic system under which politicians would use their offices to create patronage networks, and personal differences between politicians were far greater than any ideological differences.

With the Great Depression, the Philippines started to be seen as a liability in the United States as demands were made to end Filipino immigration to the United States and end the tariff free importation of Filipino agriculture into the American market as many American farmers complained they could not compete with Filipino farmers. To end Filipino immigration and access to the American market, many U.S. congressional leaders favored granting immediate independence to the Philippines. At the same time that the U.S. Congress was debating granting independence to the Philippines, many Filipino leaders were worried by the increasing assertive claims being made by Japan that all of East Asia was its sphere of influence. In a role reversal, it was the Filipinos who were opposed to immediate independence, which was proposed in the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill being debated within the halls of Congress.

In early 1930, Roxas flew to the United States with Sergio Osmeña to lobby the U.S. Congress to go slow on the granting of independence in the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill. Aside from the fear of Japan, many Filipinos were deeply worried about the plans to impose heavy tariffs on Filipino agriculture after independence, which provided another reason to go slowly with independence. In Washington, Roxas lobbied U.S. government leaders such as Secretary of State Henry Stimson and Secretary of War Patrick Hurley. Roxas testified before the U.S. Congress that he favored Philippine independence, saying the Filipinos had fulfilled the &quot;stable government&quot; provision of the Jones Act of 1916, which mandated that independence be granted when Filipinos proved that they had a &quot;stable government&quot;. However, Roxas went on to testify that &quot;with the granting of tariff autonomy, serious difficulties may arise&quot;. In common with the rest of the Filipino elite, Roxas saw the plans of the U.S. Congress to impose tariffs on Filipino goods after independence as an economic disaster for the Philippines.

In May 1930, Roxas reported to Manuel L. Quezon that both Hurley and Stimson had testified before the U.S. Congress saying that the Philippines were not ready for independence nor would be for anytime in the foreseeable future, which he thought had a major impact on the U.S. Congress. Roxas advised that Quezon should now try to appease Senators Harry B. Hawes and Bronson B. Cutting by sending them a message saying he wanted immediate independence, which Roxas felt was not likely at present. On May 24, 1930, Quezon followed Roxas&#x27;s advice and sent public telegrams to both Hawes and Cutting saying the Filipinos &quot;crave their national freedom&quot;. In a compromise, the Senate Insular Committee advised on June 2, 1930, that the Philippines should be given more autonomy to prepare for independence within the next 19 years. Upon his return to the Philippines in 1930, Roxas founded a new pro-independence group called Ang Bagong Katipunan (&quot;The New Association&quot;) that proposed disbanding all political parties under its fold and the unification of national culture in order to negotiate better with the United States. The plans for &quot;Ang Bagong Katipunan&quot; created widespread opposition, as the group was seen as too authoritarian and as a vehicle for Roxas to challenge Quezon for the leadership of the Nacionalista Party. Ang Bagong Katipunan was soon disbanded.

In the summer of 1931, Hurley visited the Philippines to assess its readiness for independence. In talks with Quezon, Osmeña, and Roxas, it was agreed that the Philippines should become an autonomous commonwealth under American rule and would be allowed to keep exporting sugar and coconut oil to the United States at the present rate. Roxas became seen as one of the less radical independence leaders, who favored &quot;going slow&quot; on independence to keep access to the U.S. market. At the time, Roxas cynically stated he and the other &quot;Nacionalistas&quot; had to make &quot;radical statements for immediate, complete and absolute independence to maintain hold of the people&quot;. Filipino politics tended to be based more on personal loyalties to a politician who would reward his followers via patronage rather than ideological issues, and despite criticism of the &quot;Democratas&quot; that the &quot;Nacionalistas&quot; had abandoned their platform, the &quot;Nacionalistas&quot; triumphed in the election of July 13, 1931. In the election, Roxas was reelected and returned to his position as speaker of Philippine House of Representatives. In September 1931, Japan seized the Manchuria region of China. After the Mukden Incident, the leaders of both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy started to argue in Washington that the Philippines occupied a strategical position in Asia, as naval and air bases located in the Philippines would allow any power that controlled them to dominate the South China Sea, the key sea that linked the markets of Southeast Asia to China. The prevailing opinion within the U.S. military was that the United States needed its Philippine bases to deter Japan from trying to seize control of all of East Asia.

In 1933, Roxas and Osmeña flew to Washington to negotiate Filipino independence from the United States. The Americans agreed to grant the Filipinos independence, but only on the condition that the United States be allowed to retain military bases in the Philippines, a condition that led for the act to be rejected by the Philippine Congress. Quezon was late to state that the allowing of the United States to retain its bases in the Philippines would make Filipino independence no different from the independence of the Japanese sham state of Manchukuo.

After amendments to the 1935 Philippine Constitution were approved in 1941, Roxas was elected to the Philippine Senate, but was unable to serve until 1945 because of the outbreak of World War II. The United States was scheduled to grant the Philippines independence in 1945 while Japan started to make claims for a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from 1940 onward. In common with other members of the Filipino elite, Roxas started to cultivate ties with Japan as it was unclear whatever the Philippines would remain in the American sphere of influence after independence or fall into the Japanese sphere of influence. However, as the United States was planning on granting independence, ending more than 400 years of foreign rule, Filipino public opinion was hostile to the idea of the Philippines joining the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Having enrolled prior to World War II as an officer in the reserves, Roxas was made liaison officer between the Commonwealth government and the USAFFE headquarters of General Douglas MacArthur. On December 7, 1941, Japan went to war against the United States, bombing the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, while also bombing American bases in the Philippines. Shortly after, Japanese invasion forces landed on Luzon, the largest and most populous of the islands of the Philippine archipelago. MacArthur had claimed that the American–Filipino forces under his command would stop any Japanese invasion &quot;on the beaches&quot;, but instead the Japanese forces marched on Manila, the capital and largest city of the Philippines. Roxas accompanied President Quezon to Corregidor where he supervised the destruction of Philippine currency to prevent its capture by the Japanese. When Quezon left Corregidor, Roxas went to Mindanao to direct the resistance there. It was prior to Quezon&#x27;s departure that he was made executive secretary and designated as successor to the presidency in case Quezon or Vice President Sergio Osmeña were captured or killed. On January 3, 1942, President Quezon presented General MacArthur with a secret guaranty of $500,000. The payment was related to the Filipino concept of &quot;utang na loob&quot;, where one offers a lavish gift in order to create a reciprocal obligation from the individual who receives the gift. Through the payment was legal, it was questionable from an ethical perspective, and MacArthur always kept the payment secret, which did not become public knowledge until 1979. Later that year, Quezon offered payment to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, which he refused, saying that as a United States Army official, his first loyalty was to the United States, which made accepting such a payment as morally wrong in his viewpoint. Roxas was one of the few people who did know about Quezon&#x27;s gift to MacArthur.

Roxas was captured in April 1942 by the Japanese invasion forces. He became chief advisor to the collaborationist government of Jose P. Laurel. The American journalist Richard Rovere described Roxas as typical of the Filipino &quot;hacendado&quot; class (the wealthy owners of the &quot;hacienda&quot; estates) who sought to opportunistically ingratiate themselves with whatever power ruled the Philippines. An additional reason for the &quot;hacendados&quot; to support the Japanese occupation was that the main resistance group, the &quot;Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon &quot; (People&#x27;s Army against the Japanese), better known as the Huks, was a Communist movement. Besides for opposing the Japanese, the Huks promised land reform, by breaking up the &quot;haciendas&quot;, which caused the &quot;hacendados&quot; as a group to support the Japanese. The Manila chapter of the fascist Falange party had a membership of about 10,000 people, including members of the most prominent &quot;hacendado&quot; families such as the Ayalas, Zobels, Elizaldes and Sorianos. By 1945, the Huks had over 70,000 guerrillas in action, making them into easily the largest resistance group in the Philippines. The American historian Russell Buhite wrote: &quot;Roxas was the Philippine equivalent of the fabled French statesman Charles Maurice de Tallyrand who was able to blend with the wind, able to work with authority wherever he found it&quot;. The American historian Richard Bernstein stated: &quot;If Japan had won the war...the top man in the Philippines today would probably have been Manuel Roxas&quot;. 

During Japanese occupation, Roxas provided intelligence to General MacArthur and the American forces via the intelligence-gathering apparatus and efforts of Chick Parsons. Disguised as a Catholic priest, the bearded, tanned Parsons would visit Roxas even while the latter was effectively under house arrest, and privately &quot;receive confession&quot; from the Filipino statesman regarding the disposition of the Japanese forces, the collaborationist government, and various matters of state. Roxas also passed on information from Malacañang to the Fil-Am guerrilla movement through Ramona Snyder, the lover of guerrilla Edwin Ramsey. 

On October 20, 1943, the head of the Japanese military police, Akira Nagahama, surprised President Laurel in Malacañang and demanded the arrest of Roxas, whose office was a short distance away. Laurel replied, &quot;You can go and get Roxas, but you&#x27;ll have to kill me first.&quot;

Control of the rice supplies and pricing was power politics in Manila. President Laurel and Roxas, as chief of the Government Rice Procurement Authority, secretly blocked Japanese access to the rice stores controlled by the agency—they wanted to project that the largest possible supply of the staple food would be available to the civilian population at the lowest possible price. They managed the system successfully. But when the Japanese occupiers were forced to use their own procurement methods outside of the Laurel government, short supply and high demand drove the prices up for everyone.

Eventually as the war progressed, Japan managed to divert most of the rice harvest to feed the Japanese forces in Southeast Asia. The ruthless policies of confiscating rice harvests pushed many of the Filipino peasantry to the brink of starvation and made Roxas into one of the most hated men in the Philippines. 

Roxas served in the Laurel government until April 1945, when he surrendered to American forces at Baguio. After his capture, MacArthur publicized Roxas&#x27; contributions to the resistance movement. MacArthur may have been blackmailed by Roxas, who threatened to reveal the guaranty he accepted in 1942. This was dangerous for The General, as MacArthur had ambitions to run as the candidate of the Republican Party for the 1944 United States presidential election. MacArthur&#x27;s political ambitions were an open secret at the time. In early 1944, letters between MacArthur and Congressman Albert Miller were leaked to the press, wherein MacArthur expressed his criticism of the policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, and dropped hints that he would be willing to accept the Republican nomination for the presidential election to be held after the war.

Shortly after his capture, Roxas told the Americans that he wanted the United States to keep its military bases in the Philippines after independence in 1946, and promised to use all of his influence to persuade the Filipino congress to accept independence on those terms. Buhite wrote that by pardoning Roxas, MacArthur &quot;...undermined his ability to treat other collaborators more harshly&quot;. Beyond his presidential ambitions, MacArthur had additional reasons to treat Roxas leniently. MacArthur believed that the men of the &quot;hacendado&quot; class, such as Roxas, were capable of providing the Philippines with competent leadership. The general felt that whatever Roxas and the other &quot;hacendados&quot; had done during the Japanese occupation was irrelevant compared to the need to have the &quot;haendados&quot; continue as the dominant group as MacArthur believed that the Philippines would descend into anarchy without the leadership of the educated class which had been responsible for governance since the time of the Spanish.

Osmeña was opposed to MacArthur&#x27;s rehabilitation of Roxas, only to receive the reply that: &quot;I have known General Roxas for over twenty years, and I know that he is no threat to our military security. Therefore we are not detaining here&quot;. It has been reported that MacArthur disliked President Osmeña, whom he felt was an incompetent leader, and much preferred Roxas to be the country&#x27;s next president. The charismatic Roxas made for more appealing social company, which he used to his advantage in his dealings with The General. Moreover, Osmeña had often opposed MacArthur before the war. President Osmeña traveled to Washington in early 1945 to appeal for President Roosevelt&#x27;s help against MacArthur, but he made tactless remarks in his meeting at the White House, inspiring the American president to declare that MacArthur should be allowed to rule the Philippines whatever way he liked. MacArthur announced in a speech that Roxas was &quot;one of the prime factors in the guerilla movement&quot; against the Japanese. Aside from Roxas, MacArthur pardoned over 5,000 Filipino collaborators. Even though over 80% of the Philippine Army officers went over to the Japanese in 1942, their commissions were restated.

When the Congress of the Philippines re-convened in 1945, legislators elected in 1941 Roxas as Senate president. Of all members of the 1st Commonwealth Congress, 8 out of 14 senators and 19 out of 67 representatives had collaborated with the Japanese during the occupation. In an attempt to undermine Osmeña&#x27;s chances of winning the 1946 Philippine presidential election, MacArthur forced the Osmeña administration to make unpopular decisions while he groomed Roxas to run in the 1946 election. On April 12, 1945, President Roosevelt died and his vice-president, Harry S Truman, succeeded him. Truman had little interest in the Philippines, as he had more pressing concerns to face in his first months of office. When MacArthur left the Philippines for Japan to sign the armistice ending the war on August 30, 1945, the Philippines has been in a chaotic state, with the economy in tatters and the political status undecided. When he took over the American occupation of Japan, MacArthur in turn lost his interest in the Philippines, only returning to Manila on July 4, 1946, to witness the declaration of Filipino independence before promptly returning to Tokyo.

==Presidential election of 1946==
Prior to the Philippine national elections of 1946, at the height of the last Commonwealth elections, Senate President Roxas and his friends left the Nacionalista Party and formed the Liberal Party. Roxas became their candidate for president and Elpidio Quirino for vice-president. The Nacionalistas, on the other hand, had Osmeña for president and Senator Eulogio Rodriguez for vice-president. Roxas had the staunch support of General MacArthur. The American military government strongly favored Roxas during the election, regarding him as the Filipino politician most likely to allow the American bases to continue in the Philippines after independence. The British historian Francis Pike wrote that Roxas &quot;effectively brought&quot; the 1946 election, helped by the fact that he owned the largest newspaper empire in the Philippines. The Roxas newspapers election coverage were essentially campaign ads for the Roxas campaign. Osmeña refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew of his reputation. On April 23, 1946, Roxas won 54% of the vote, and the Liberal Party won a majority in the legislature.

== Presidency (1946–1948) ==
===Administration and cabinet===
===Last president of the Commonwealth===
On May 28, 1946, prior to his inauguration, president-elect Roxas, accompanied by United States High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt, left for the United States. During his U.S. visit, Roxas came out clearly for the United States to maintain its bases after independence, saying in a speech: &quot;We will welcome the existence of your naval, air and army bases on such of our soil as it is mutually agreeable for the common protection of the United States and the Philippines, and will co-operate in the defense and security of those bases insofar as it is within our power to do so&quot;. After the experience of the Japanese occupation, Filipino public opinion was no longer against the presence of American bases after independence in quite the same way as before 1941. However, the U.S. government was apparently not aware of the change in public opinion, and favored Roxas as the man best able to allow the United States to keep its bases after independence.

On May 10, 1946, a draft agreement was signed in Washington allowing the United States to keep its Filipino bases for 99 years after independence. Roxas was willing to sign the agreement, but demanded that the number of American bases be reduced and complained that the sweeping immunity from Filipino law enjoyed by American military personnel envisioned in the agreement would not be popular with Filipino public opinion. He also made it clear that he was more comfortable with the Americans mostly having naval and air bases in the Philippines, and wanted the number of U.S. Army bases kept to the minimum. Some aspects of the Roxas desiderata were incorporated in the final agreement as the Americans agreed to reduce the number of bases in the Philippines after independence. Roxas&#x27;s argument against the U.S. Army having bases were also incorporated in the agreement, through the fact that the Pentagon saw the Philippines primarily as a place to project power into Asia led to most of the American bases being naval and air bases. Furthermore, as long the Americans dominated the waters and air spaces around the Philippines, another invasion was unlikely. However, the Americans refused to give make concessions on the immunity issue, being adamant that American military personnel enjoy immunity from Filipino law after independence.

On May 28, 1946, Roxas was inaugurated as the last president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. The inaugural ceremonies were held in the ruins of the Legislative Building (now part of the National Museum of the Philippines) and were witnessed by about 200,000 people. In his address, he outlined the main policies of his administration, mainly: closer ties with the United States; adherence to the newly created United Nations; national reconstruction; relief for the masses; social justice for the working class; the maintenance of peace and order; the preservation of individual rights and liberties of the citizenry; and honesty and efficiency of government.

On June 3, 1946, Roxas appeared for the first time before a joint session of Congress to deliver his first State of the Nation Address. Among other things, he told the members of the Congress the grave problems and difficulties the Philippines face and reported on his special trip to the United States to discuss the approval for independence.

On June 21, Roxas reappeared in front of another joint session of Congress and urged the acceptance of two laws passed by the Congress of the United States on April 30, 1946—the Tydings–McDuffie Act, of Philippine Rehabilitation Act, and the Bell Trade Act or Philippine Trade Act. Both recommendations were accepted by the Congress. Under the Bell Trade Act, the goods from the Philippines were granted tariff-free access to the American market, achieving one of Roxas&#x27;s key aims; in exchange, he accepted pegging the Philippine peso to the U.S. dollar and American corporations were granted parity rights when it came to exploiting the minerals and forests of the Philippines. In exchange for accepting the Bell Trade Act, the U.S. Congress voted for some $2 billion in aid to the Philippines. Though the $2 billion was intended to assist with the reconstruction of the war-devastated nation, the vast majority of the money was stolen by Roxas and his corrupt friends. The American journalist Robert Shaplen noted after a visit to Manila: &quot;It may well be that in no other city in the world was there so much graft and corruption and conniving after the war&quot;.

In the congressional elections, the Huks joined forces with socialists and peasant unions to form a new party, the Democratic Alliance. The party won six seats in Congress on a platform of punishing collaborators, land reform and opposing the Bell Trade Act. Among the Huk leaders elected to Congress was the party&#x27;s leader Luis Taruc. In what was described as &quot;a monstrous abrogation of democratic procedure&quot;, Roxas expelled all members of Congress from the Democratic Alliance, claiming that they been elected illegally, and replaced them with his own bets. Roxas&#x27;s expulsion of the Democratic Alliance from Congress was the beginning of a nation-wide purge of those who served in the Huk resistance against the Japanese as arrests and murders followed. Those who survived fled to the jungle and formed the &quot;Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan&quot; (the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army).&quot;.

===First president of the Third Republic (1946–1948)===

Roxas served as the president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in a brief period, from May 28, 1946, to July 4, 1946, during which time Roxas helped prepare the groundwork for an independent Philippines. He was inugurated at the ruins of Legislative Building in Manila, which was ruined during the World War II. Chief Justice Manuel Moran administered the oath of office.

Roxas&#x27;s term as the president of the Commonwealth ended on the morning of July 4, 1946, when the Third Republic of the Philippines was inaugurated and independence from the United States proclaimed. The occasion, attended by some 300,000 people, was marked by the simultaneous lowering of the U.S. flag and raising of the Philippine national flag, a 21-gun salute, and the pealing of church bells. Roxas then took the oath of office as the first president of the new republic before Supreme Court Chief Justice Manuel Moran.

The inaugural ceremonies took place at Luneta Park in the City of Manila. On the Grandstand alone were around 3,000 dignitaries and guests, consisting of President Roxas, Vice President Quirino, their respective parties, and the Cabinet; first United States Ambassador to the Philippines Paul McNutt; General Douglas MacArthur (coming from Tokyo); United States Postmaster General Robert E. Hannegan; a delegation from the U.S. Congress led by Maryland Senator Millard Tydings (author of the Tydings–McDuffie Act) and Missouri Representative C. Jasper Bell (author of the Bell Trade Act); and former Civil Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison.

===Domestic policies===

====Economy====
No sooner had the fanfare of the independence festivities ended that the government and the people quickly put all hands to work in the tasks of rescuing the country from its dire economic straits. Reputed to be the most bombed and destroyed country in the world, the Philippines was in a sorry mess. Only Stalingrad and Warsaw, for instance, could compare with Manila in point of destruction. All over the country more than a million people were unaccounted for. The war casualties as such could very well reach the two million mark. Conservative estimates had it that the Philippines had lost about two thirds of her material wealth. In 1946, the Filipino gross domestic produce was down 38.7% from where it had been in 1937.

The country was facing near bankruptcy. There was no national economy, no export trade. Indeed, production for exports had not been restored. On the other hand, imports were to reach the amount of three million dollars. There was need of immediate aid from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Something along this line was obtained. Again, loans from the United States, as well as some increase in the national revenues, were to help the new Republic.

Among the main remedies proposed was the establishment of the Philippine Rehabilitation Finance Corporation. This entity would be responsible for the construction of twelve thousand houses and for the grant of easy-term loans in the amount of P177,000,000. Another proposal was the creation of the Central Bank of the Philippines to help stabilize the Philippine dollar reserves and coordinate and the nations banking activities gearing them to the economic progress.

Concentrating on the sugar industry, Roxas would exert such efforts as to succeed in increasing production from 13,000 tons at the time of the Philippine liberation to an all-high of one million tons.

====Reconstruction after the war====
The war had burned cities and towns, ruined farms and factories, blasted roads and bridges, shattered industries and commerce, massacred thousands of civilians, and paralyzed the educational system, where 80% of the school buildings, their equipment, laboratories and furniture were destroyed. Numberless books, invaluable documents and works of art, irreplaceable historical relics and family heirlooms, hundreds of churches and temples were burned. The reconstruction of the damaged school buildings alone cost more than ₱126,000,000,000. Pike noted that the Japanese as part of their efforts of &quot;liberation&quot; from American imperialism by bringing the Philippines into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere &quot;...had smashed industrial buildings, banks, government offices and hotels. Infrastructure including ports had been sabotaged or destroyed in the heavy fighting for Manila&quot;.

The new republic began to function on an annual deficit of over P200,000,000 with little prospect of a balanced budget for some years to come. Manila and other cities then were infested with criminal gangs which used techniques of American gangsters in some activities—bank holdups, kidnapping and burglaries. In rural regions, especially the provinces of Central Luzon and the Southern Tagalog regions, the brigands terrorized towns and barrios.

====Agrarian reform====
In 1946, shortly after his induction to presidency, Roxas proclaimed the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933 effective throughout the country. However, problems of land tenure continued. In fact, these became worse in certain areas. Among the remedial measures enacted was Republic Act No. 34, likewise known as the Tenant Act, which provided for a 70–30 sharing arrangements and regulated share-tenancy contracts. It was passed to resolve the ongoing peasant unrest in Central Luzon.

====Amnesty Proclamation====
President Roxas, on January 28, 1948, granted full amnesty to all Philippine collaborators, many of whom were on trial or awaiting to be tried, particularly former President José P. Laurel (1943–1945). The Amnesty Proclamation did not apply to those collaborators, who were charged with the commission of common crimes, such as murder, rape, and arson. The presidential decision did much to heal a standing wound that somehow threatened to divide the people&#x27;s sentiments. It was a much-called for measure to bring about a closer unity in the trying times when such was most needed for the progress of the nation.

====Civil war====
After persecuting the &quot;Hukbóng Bayan Laban sa Hapón&quot;, Roxas opened peace talks with the Huks and invited a delegation of Huk leaders led by Juan Feleo to come to Manila in August 1946. While returning to their jungle bases, Felco and the other Huk leaders were ambushed by police forces, with Felco&#x27;s head was found floating in the Pampanga River. The ambush was intended to cripple the Huks, but instead led to a civil war as the police and the army rapidly lost control of much of Luzon to the Huks. Strongly opposed to the guerrilla movement &quot;Hukbó ng Bayan Laban sa Hapón&quot; (Nation&#x27;s Army Against the Japanese, also called &quot;the Huks&quot;), Roxas issued a proclamation outlawing the Huk movement on March 6, 1948. At the same time, Roxas pardoned the Filipinos who had collaborated with the Japanese. The pardon of the collaborators lent some substance to the charge by the Huks that his administration was a continuation of the wartime collaborationist puppet government.

The Central Intelligence Agency in a report noted that the Philippines was dominated by &quot;an irresponsible ruling class which exercises economic and political power almost exclusively in its own interests&quot;. Secretary of State Dean Acheson complained that the Philippines was one of the most corrupt nations in Asia as he commented with some understatement &quot;much of the aid to the Philippines has not been used as wisely as we wish it had&quot;. Acheson wanted to cease aid to the Philippines until reforms were mounted to crack down on corruption, but was blocked by John Melby, the head of the Filipino desk at the U.S. State Department, who warned that to cut off aid would mean handing over the Philippines to the Huks. U.S. officials throughout the late 1940s that Roxas was a corrupt leader whose policies openly favored the &quot;hacendado&quot; class and that unless reforms were made, it was inevitable that the Huks would win.

===Foreign policies===
====Treaty of General Relations====

On August 5, 1946, Congress ratified the Treaty of General Relations that had been entered into by and between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States on July 4, 1946. Aside from withdrawing her sovereignty from the Philippines and recognizing her independence, the Treaty reserved for the United States some bases for the mutual protection of both countries; consented that the United States represent the Philippines in countries where the latter had not yet established diplomatic representation; made the Philippines assume all debts and obligations of the former government in the Philippines; and provided for the settlement of property rights of the citizens of both countries.

====United States military bases====

Although Roxas was successful in getting rehabilitation funds from the United States after independence, he was forced to concede military bases (23 of which were leased for 99 years), trade restriction for the Philippine citizens, and special privileges for U.S. property owners and investors. On March 21, 1947, the United States granted the Philippines some $17.7 million in military aid and another $25 million to assist with reconstruction. The Communist Huk rebellion led to fears in the United States that the Huks might come to power while the fact that the Kuomintang were clearly losing the Chinese civil war by this point led to the very real possibility that Chinese Communists might come to the power. In turn, there was much fear in Washington that a Communist China would grant the Soviet Union air and naval bases. The possibility of a Communist China vastly increased the geopolitical importance of the Philippines to the United States, which wanted to retain its air and naval bases in the Philippines to maintain control of the South China Sea. The Americans made it clear that they were prepared to pay &quot;handsomely&quot; for the right to keep their Filipino bases, which Roxas exploited.

====Parity Rights Amendment====
On March 11, 1947, Philippine voters, agreeing with Roxas, ratified in a nationwide plebiscite the &quot;parity amendment&quot; to the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines, granting United States citizens the right to dispose of and utilize Philippine natural resources, or &quot;parity rights&quot;.

====Turtle and Mangsee Islands====

On September 19, 1946, the Republic of the Philippines notified the United Kingdom that it wished to take over the administration of the Turtle Islands and the Mangsee Islands. Pursuant to a supplemental international agreement, the transfer of administration became effective on October 16, 1947.

===Controversies===
His administration was marred by graft and corruption; moreover, the abuses of the provincial military police contributed to the rise of the left-wing (Huk) movement in the countryside. His heavy-handed attempts to crush the Huks led to widespread peasant disaffection.

The good record of the Roxas administration was marred by notable failures: the failure to curb graft and corruption in the government (as evidenced by the surplus war property scandal), the Chinese immigration scandal, the school supplies scandal and the failure to check and stop the communist Hukbalahap movement.

===Assassination attempt===
The night before the plebiscite, Roxas narrowly escaped assassination by Julio Guillen, a disgruntled barber from Tondo, Manila, who hurled a grenade at the platform on Plaza Miranda immediately after Roxas had addressed a rally.

==Death==

On April 15, 1948, President Roxas delivered a speech before the United States Thirteenth Air Force at the Kelly Theater in Clark Air Base, Pampanga. After the speech, he suffered dizziness and fatigue and was brought to the residence of Major General Eugene L. Eubank. That night, he suffered multiple heart attacks and died at 9:23 pm at the age of 56.

His body was brought to Manila the following day on a special train, reaching Malacañang at about 9:20 am. Sessions of Congress were suspended until after the burial which was set on Sunday, April 25, 1948. Vice President Elpidio Quirino, who was on board a southern cruise at the time of Roxas&#x27;s death, arrived in Manila on April 17. That morning, Quirino immediately went to Malacañang and took the oath of office as president in the Council of State Room. The new president then appointed a committee to take charge of the funeral arrangements for the late president and issued a proclamation declaring a period of national mourning from April 17 to May 17.

Roxas was buried at the Manila North Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Roxas married Trinidad de Leon on April 14, 1921, in a quiet ceremony at the Chapel of Sibul Springs, San Miguel, Bulacan. The couple had two children, Rosario &quot;Ruby&quot; and Gerardo (Gerry). Roxas also fathered three children with Juanita Muriedas McIlvain – Rosario &quot;Charo&quot; Roxas (mother of Margie Moran), Consuelo Roxas, and Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Roxas, Jr.

==Legacy==
On July 3, 1956, Roxas was posthumously awarded the Quezon Service Cross. The award was presented to his widow, Trinidad de Leon-Roxas, by Vice President Carlos P. Garcia on behalf of President Ramon Magsaysay. 

In his honor, various cities and municipalities in the Philippines have been renamed after him, including Roxas, Oriental Mindoro in (1948), the first town to be named as such; Roxas, Isabela (1948); President Roxas, Capiz (1949); Roxas City, Capiz (1951); Roxas, Palawan (1951); President Roxas, Cotabato (1967); and President Manuel A. Roxas, Zamboanga del Norte (1967). Dewey Boulevard in Metro Manila was renamed in his memory, and he is currently depicted on the 100 Philippine peso bill.

Franko was born in the Ukrainian village of Nahuievychi, then located in the Austrian &quot;kronland&quot; of Galicia, today part of Drohobych Raion, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. As a child, he was baptized as Ivan by Father Yosyp Levytsky, known as a poet and the author of the first Galician-Ruthenian (&quot;Grammar&quot;), who was later exiled to Nahuyevychi for a &quot;sharp tongue&quot;. At home, however, Ivan was called Myron because of a local superstitious belief that naming a person by a different name will dodge death. Franko&#x27;s family in Nahuyevychi was considered &quot;well-to-do&quot;, with their own servants and of owned property.

Franko&#x27;s family possibly had German origins, being descendants of German colonists. Ivan Franko believed it to be true. That statement is also supported by Timothy Snyder who describes Yakiv Franko as a village blacksmith of German Roman Catholic descent. For certain the Franko family was already living in Galicia when the country was incorporated into Austria in 1772. Ivan Franko&#x27;s great-grandfather Teodor (Fed) Franko baptized his children in the Greek Catholic church.

Franko&#x27;s mother Maria came from a family of petty nobility. The Kulczyckis (or Kulchytskys) were an ancient noble family hailing from the village of Kulchytsi in the Sambir Raion. Her mother was Ludwika Kulczycka, widow with six children from Yasenytsia Silna. Researchers describe Franko&#x27;s mother&#x27;s nationality as Polish or Ukrainian. The petty gentry in Eastern Galicia often retained elements of Polish culture and fostered a sense of solidarity with the Polish nobility, but they also Ruthenized and blended in with the surrounding peasantry. For example, Franko&#x27;s uncle Ivan Kulczycki took part in the Polish uprising of 1863. Franko&#x27;s distant relative, aunt Koszycka, with whom he lived while studying in Drohobych, spoke Polish and Ruthenian.

Ivan Franko attended school in the village Yasenytsia Sylna from 1862 until 1864, and from there attended the Basilian monastic school in Drohobych until 1867. His father died before Ivan was able to graduate from the gymnasium (realschule), but his stepfather supported Ivan in continuing his education. Soon, however, Franko found himself completely without parents after his mother died as well and later the young Ivan stayed with totally unrelated people. In 1875, he graduated from the Drohobych Realschule, and continued on to Lviv University, where he studied classical philosophy, Ukrainian language and literature. It was at this university that Franko began his literary career, with various works of poetry and his novel &quot;Petriï i Dovbushchuky&quot; published by the students&#x27; magazine &quot;Druh&quot; (&quot;Friend&quot;), whose editorial board he would later join.

A meeting with Mykhailo Drahomanov at Lviv University made a huge impression on Ivan Franko. It later developed into a long political and literary association. Franko&#x27;s own socialist writings and his association with Drahomanov led to his arrest in 1877, along with Mykhailo Pavlyk and Ostap Terletsky, among others. They were accused of belonging to a secret socialist organization, which did not in fact exist. However, the nine months in prison did not discourage his political writing or activities. In prison, Franko wrote the satire &quot;Smorhonska Akademiya&quot; (&quot;The Smorhon Academy&quot;). After release, he studied the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, contributed articles to the Polish newspaper &quot;Praca&quot; (&quot;Labor&quot;) and helped organize workers&#x27; groups in Lviv. In 1878 Franko and Pavlyk founded the magazine &quot;Hromads&#x27;kyi Druh&quot; (&quot;Public Friend&quot;). Only two issues were published before it was banned by the government; however, the journal was reborn under the names &quot;Dzvin&quot; (&quot;Bell&quot;) and &quot;Molot&quot; (&quot;Mallet&quot;). Franko published a series of books called &quot;Dribna Biblioteka&quot; (&quot;Petty Library&quot;) from 1878 until his second arrest for arousing the peasants to civil disobedience in 1880. After three months in the Kolomyia prison, the writer returned to Lviv. His impressions of this exile are reflected in his novel &quot;Na Dni&quot; (&quot;At the Bottom&quot;). Upon his release, Franko was kept under police surveillance. At odds with the administration, Franko was expelled from Lviv University, an institution that would be renamed Ivan Franko National University of Lviv after the writer&#x27;s death.

Franko was an active contributor to the journal &quot;Svit&quot; (&quot;The World&quot;) in 1881. He wrote more than half of the material, excluding the unsigned editorials. Later that year, Franko moved to his native Nahuievychi, where he wrote the novel &quot;Zakhar Berkut&quot;, translated Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Heine&#x27;s poem &quot;Deutschland: ein Wintermärchen&quot; into Ukrainian. He also wrote a series of articles on Taras Shevchenko, and reviewed the collection &quot;Khutorna Poeziya&quot; (&quot;Khutir Poetry&quot;) by Panteleimon Kulish. Franko worked for the journal &quot;Zorya&quot; (&quot;Sunrise&quot;), and became a member of the editing board of the newspaper &quot;Dilo&quot; (&quot;Action&quot;) a year later.

Franko married Olha Khoruzhynska from Kyiv in May 1886, to whom he dedicated the collection &quot;Z vershyn i nyzyn&quot; (&quot;From Tops and Bottoms&quot;), a book of poetry and verse. The couple lived in Vienna for some time, where Ivano Franko met with Theodor Herzl and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. His wife was to later suffer from a debilitating mental illness due to the death of the first-born son, Andriy, one of the reasons that Franko would not leave Lviv for treatment in Kyiv in 1916, shortly before his death.

In 1888, Franko was a contributor to the journal &quot;Pravda&quot;, which, along with his association with compatriots from Dnieper Ukraine, led to a third arrest in 1889. After this two-month prison term, he co-founded the Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party with Mykhailo Drahomanov and Mykhailo Pavlyk. Franko was the Radical party&#x27;s candidate for seats in the parliament of Austria and the Galicia Diet, but never won an election.

In 1891, Franko attended the Franz-Josephs-Universität Czernowitz (where he prepared a dissertation on Ivan Vyshensky), and then attended the University of Vienna to defend a doctoral dissertation on the spiritual romance &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat&quot; under the supervision of Vatroslav Jagić, who was considered the foremost expert of Slavic languages at the time. Franko received his doctorate of philosophy from University of Vienna on July 1, 1893. He was appointed lecturer in the history of Ukrainian literature at Lviv University in 1894; however, he was not able to chair the Department of Ukrainian literature there because of opposition from Vicegerent Kazimierz Badeni and Galician conservative circles.

One of Franko&#x27;s articles, &quot;Sotsiializm i sotsiial-demokratyzm&quot; (&quot;Socialism and Social Democracy&quot;), a severe criticism of Ukrainian Social Democracy and the socialism of Marx and Engels, was published in 1898 in the journal &quot;Zhytie i Slovo&quot;, which he and his wife founded. He continued his anti-Marxist stance in a collection of poetry entitled &quot;Mii smarahd&quot; (&quot;My Emerald&quot;) in 1898, where he called Marxism &quot;a religion founded on dogmas of hatred and class struggle&quot;. His long-time collaborative association with Mykhailo Drahomanov was strained due to their diverging views on socialism and the national question. Franko would later accuse Drahomanov of tying Ukraine&#x27;s fate to that of Russia in &quot;Suspil&#x27;nopolitychni pohliady M. Drahomanova&quot; (&quot;The Sociopolitical Views of M. Drahomanov&quot;), published in 1906. After a split in the Radical Party, in 1899, Franko, together with the Lviv historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, founded the National Democratic Party, where he worked until 1904 when he retired from political life.

In 1902, students and activists in Lviv, embarrassed that Franko was living in poverty, purchased a house for him in the city. He lived there for the remaining 14 years of his life. The house is now the site of the Ivan Franko Museum.

In 1904 Franko took part in an ethnographic expedition in the Boyko areas with Filaret Kolesa, Fedir Vovk, and a Russian ethnographer.

1914 saw publication of his jubilee collection, &quot;Pryvit Ivanovi Frankovi&quot; (&quot;Greeting Ivan Franko&quot;), and of his collection &quot;Iz lit moyeyi molodosti&quot; (&quot;From the Years of My Youth&quot;).

In the last nine years of his life, Franko seldom physically wrote, as he suffered from rheumatism which eventually paralyzed his right arm. He was assisted as amanuensis by his sons, particularly Andriy.

In 1916, Josef Zastyretz and Harald Hjärne proposed Franko for the 1916 Nobel Prize in Literature, but he died before the nomination materialized.

==Death==

Franko died in poverty at 4 pm on 28 May 1916. Those who came to pay their respects saw him lying on the table covered with nothing but a ragged sheet. His burial and burial clothes were paid for by his admirers, and none of his family came to visit him. Franko was buried at the Lychakivskiy Cemetery in Lviv.

Soon after Franko&#x27;s death, the world witnessed the creation of two Ukrainian republics.

According to Roland Franko, his grandfather was tall, had red hair, always wore mustache and the Ukrainian embroidered shirt (vyshyvanka) even with a dress-coat.

Some of Franko&#x27;s descendants emigrated to the US and Canada. His grand-nephew, Yuri Shymko, is a Canadian politician and human rights activist living in Toronto, who was elected to Canada&#x27;s Parliament as well as the Ontario Legislature during the 1980s.

== Literary works ==
&quot;Lesyshyna Cheliad&quot; and &quot;Dva Pryiateli&quot; (&quot;Two Friends&quot;) were published in the literary almanac &quot;Dnistrianka&quot; in 1876. Later that year he wrote his first collection of poetry, &quot;Ballads and Tales&quot;. His first of the stories in the &quot;Boryslav&quot; series was published in 1877.

Franko depicted the harsh experience of Ukrainian workers and peasants in his novels &quot;Boryslav Laughs&quot; (1881–1882) and &quot;Boa Constrictor&quot; (1878). His works deal with Ukrainian nationalism and history (&quot;Zakhar Berkut&quot;, 1883), social issues (&quot;Basis of Society&quot;, 1895 and &quot;Withered Leaves&quot;, 1896), and philosophy (&quot;Semper Tiro&quot;, 1906).

He has drawn parallels to the Israelite search for a homeland and the Ukrainian desire for independence in &quot;In Death of Cain&quot; (1889) and &quot;Moses&quot; (1905). &quot;Stolen Happiness&quot; (1893) is considered as his best dramatic masterpiece. In total, Franko has written more than 1,000 works.

He was widely promoted in Ukraine during the Soviet period, particularly for his poem &quot;Kameniari&quot; (groundbreakers) which contains revolutionary political ideas, hence earning him the name &quot;Kameniar&quot; (groundbreaker).

An anthology containing short stories and novellas by Franko entitled &quot;Faces of Hardship&quot; was published in 2021.

==Legacy==

In 1962 the city of Stanyslaviv in Western Ukraine (formerly Stanisławów, Poland) was renamed Ivano-Frankivsk in the poet&#x27;s honor.

On the Centennial of Franko&#x27;s PhD defence in 1993, the then Austrian vice chancellor Erhard Busek had a commemorative bust installed in the university building on Ringstrasse, opposite &quot;Übungsraum&quot; 1 and 2 at the Department of Germanistik. In 2013, an additional plaque was added, after an academic symposium had clarified Franko&#x27;s relationship to Judaism, mentioned anti-Semitic stereotypes in Franko&#x27;s work as well as close Jewish friends.

As of November 2018 on the Ukrainian-controlled part of Ukraine there were 552 streets named after Ivan Franko.

He is also associated with the name Kameniar for his famous poem, &quot;Kameniari&quot; (&quot;The Rock Breakers&quot;), especially during the time of the Soviet regime. Although he was a socialist, his political views mostly did not correspond to Soviet ideology. On 8 April 1978, the astronomer Nikolai Chernykh named an asteroid in honor of Franko by way of this name, 2428 Kamenyar.

In the Americas, Ivan Franko&#x27;s legacy is alive to this day. Cyril Genik, the best man at Franko&#x27;s wedding, emigrated to Canada. Genik became the first Ukrainian to be employed by the Canadian government – working as an immigration agent. With his cousin Ivan Bodrug, and Bodrug&#x27;s friend Ivan Negrich, the three were known as the Березівѕка Трійця (the Bereziv Triumvirate) in Winnipeg. Imbued by Franko&#x27;s nationalism and liberalism, Genik and his Triumvirate had no compunction about bringing Bishop Seraphim to Winnipeg in 1903 – a renegade Russian monk, consecrated a bishop on Mount Athos – to free the Ukrainians of all the religious and political groups in Canada who were wrangling to assimilate them. Within two years, the charismatic Seraphim built the notorious Tin Can Cathedral in Winnipeg&#x27;s North-End, which claimed nearly 60,000 adherents. Today, the bust of Ivan Franko, which stands triumphantly on a pillar in the courtyard of the Ivan Franko Manor on McGregor St. in Winnipeg, looks fondly across the street. Two churches stood here, the first (this building has since been demolished) that Seraphim blessed and opened for service upon his arrival, before building his Cathedral. The second was the Independent Greek Church (this building is still intact) of which Ivan Bodrug became the head after Seraphim was removed. Franko&#x27;s consciousness had been bold, and on the level playing ground of the new world, it served Ukrainians in Canada to find their own identity as Ukrainian-Canadians.

Ukrainian composer Yudif Grigorevna Rozhavskaya (1923-1982) used Franko’s text for her songs.

In 2019 a Ukrainian-American historical action film &quot;The Rising Hawk&quot; with budget $5 million was released. It is based on the historical fiction book &quot;Zakhar Berkut&quot; by Ivan Franko.

<doc id="747163" wikidata="Q167083" url="?curid=747163" title="Kenneth Claiborne Royall">
<text>Kenneth Claiborne Royall Sr. (July 24, 1894May 25, 1971) was a U.S. Army general and the last man to hold the office of Secretary of War, which was abolished in 1947. Royall served as the first Secretary of the Army from 1947 to 1949, until he was compelled into retirement for refusing to comply with President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s Executive Order 9981 for the racial desegregation of the military forces of the United States.

==Early life and career==
Kenneth Caliborne Royall was born on July 24, 1894, in Goldsboro, North Carolina, the son of Clara Howard Jones and George Pender Royall. He graduated from Episcopal High School and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and Harvard Law School before serving in World War I. He then practiced law and was elected to the North Carolina Senate as a Democrat. At the beginning of World War II, he became a colonel in the U.S. Army.

On August 18, 1917, Royall married the former Margaret Pierce Best, with whom he had three children: Kenneth Claiborne Jr., Margaret, and George Pender Royall.

According to a 2006 newspaper column by Jack Betts, eight German agents bent on mayhem came ashore on Long Island in 1942 but were soon caught and ordered to stand trial in a secret military tribunal. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Royall to defend them, but, wanting a swift conclusion to the process, with the Germans executed as soon as possible, ordered Royall to avoid civilian courts. Royall wrote to Roosevelt that he thought the president had no authority to convene a secret court to try his clients, and asked him to change his order. The president refused, and Royall appealed to the U.S. District Court, arguing the secret tribunal was unconstitutional.

The court rejected this argument and so Royall and other lawyers in his office appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected Royall&#x27;s argument in a brief announcement in July 1942 and upheld the right of the president to appoint a secret tribunal. However, Royall had succeeded in getting civilian court review of the tribunals&#x27; constitutionality despite the president&#x27;s predilection for secrecy.

The Supreme Court published a more detailed opinion in October, saying, &quot;Constitutional safeguards for the protection of all who are charged with offense are not to be disregarded.&quot; By then, six of Royall&#x27;s clients were dead. They had been tried, convicted, and executed in August, days after the Supreme Court&#x27;s brief announcement upholding Roosevelt&#x27;s tribunals. Two who turned themselves in and betrayed the others had their death sentences commuted to prison terms. Royall later said he believed his defense of the Germans was his most important work in a long and illustrious career. He was promoted to brigadier general.

==Truman administration==
Royall served as Undersecretary of War from November 9, 1945 until July 18, 1947. President Harry S. Truman named him Secretary of War in 1947. He became the first Secretary of the Army two months later.

In 1948, Royall refused to make public the documentary &quot;Nuremberg: Its Lesson For Today&quot; because &quot;due to policy changes, &#x27;Nuremberg&#x27; was not in the interest of the &#x27;army or the nation&#x27; and would not be released to the general public&quot;.
Royall was forced into retirement in April 1949 for continuing to refuse to desegregate the Army, nearly a year after President Truman promulgated Executive Order 9981.

==Later life and death==
In December 1949, Royall became a partner at the prestigious New York City law firm of Dwight, Harris, Koegel and Caskey, becoming the firm&#x27;s head in 1958. The firm was later renamed Rogers &amp; Wells, and it was subsequently known as Clifford Chance Rogers &amp; Wells after its merger with the British firm Clifford Chance.

Royall died in Durham, North Carolina, on May 25, 1971, aged 76. He was buried at Willow Dale Cemetery in Goldsboro, North Carolina.

His son Kenneth C. Royall Jr. (1918–1999) served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1967 to 1972 and the North Carolina Senate from 1973 to 1992.

<text>A belvedere or belvidere (from Italian for &quot;beautiful view&quot;) is an architectural structure sited to take advantage of a fine or scenic view. The term has been used both for rooms in the upper part of a building or structures on the roof, or a separate pavilion in a garden or park. The actual structure can be of any form or style, including a turret, a cupola or an open gallery. The term may be also used for a paved terrace or just a place with a good viewpoint, but no actual building. 

It has also been used as a name for a whole building, as in the Belvedere, Vienna, a huge palace, or Belvedere Castle, a folly in Central Park in New York.

==Examples==
On the hillside above the Vatican Palace (–1490), Antonio del Pollaiuolo built a small pavilion ( in Italian) named the &quot;palazzetto&quot; or the Belvedere for Pope Innocent VIII. Some years later Donato Bramante linked the Vatican with the Belvedere, a commission from Pope Julius II, by creating the Cortile del Belvedere (&quot;Courtyard of the Belvedere&quot;), in which stood the &quot;Apollo Belvedere&quot;, among the most famous of antique sculptures. This began the fashion in the 16th century for the belvedere.

<text>The BMW 8 Series is a range of grand tourer coupes and convertibles produced by BMW.

The 8 Series was introduced in 1990 under the E31 model code and was only available as a two-door coupé. It is powered by a range of naturally aspirated V8 and V12 petrol engines. The E31 started production just as E24 6 Series production ended; however, it is not considered a direct successor. The E31 was discontinued in 1999 due to poor sales.

The model range was later reintroduced in 2018 with the second generation, G15 8 Series. It launched in coupé (G15), convertible (G14), and four-door Gran Coupé (G16) body styles, as the successor to the F06/F12/F13 6 Series lineup. The G15 8 Series introduces an inline-six diesel engine, and a high-performance BMW M8 trim later joined the lineup as well as the luxury inspired Alpina B8.
== First generation (E31; 1990) ==

Design work of the first generation E31 8 Series began in 1984, with final design phase and production development starting in 1986. The car debuted at the 1989 Frankfurt Motor Show and was produced until 1999. The 8 Series was designed to move beyond the market of the original E24 6 Series, featuring greater performance and an increased price. The 8 Series was the first road car to offer a V12 engine mated to a 6-speed manual transmission and was one of the first vehicles to be fitted with electronic drive-by-wire throttle. The 8 Series was also one of BMW&#x27;s first cars to use a multi-link rear axle.

== Second generation (G14/G15/G16; 2018) ==

The BMW 8 Series (G14) was announced on 15 June 2018, with sales commencing from November 2018. It was initially available as a coupé (codenamed G15), with the convertible (G14) and four-door Gran Coupé (G16) variants introduced later, succeeding the F06/F12/F13 6 Series lineup. Production commenced in late 2018 at the BMW assembly plant in Bangkok, Thailand &amp; Dingolfing, Germany.

Direct competitors to the BMW 8 Series coupé and convertible are the Mercedes-AMG GT coupé &amp; cabriolet and Porsche 911 coupé &amp; cabriolet. The 8 series was initially conceived to be a high end competitor to brands like Ferrari and Porsche. At the time the brand had wanted to create a new luxury tier of vehicles with black branding, the 8 series and the X8 would be ultra luxury BMWs aimed at the space just below Rolls and share appointments with the high end British brand to help reduce costs. BMW was seen as falling behind in the electric vehicle sector and plans were tabled, the 8 series being the lone product of the idea and some appointments such as the crystal shift knob are the only remnants of the ultra luxury concept. For the second time in BMWs history the push up market with an 8 series branded line struggled due to poor timing. 
The 6 series had been platform mates with the 7 series since its conception and the current 8 series is closest to a 5 series though has the carbon fiber core from the 7 series which is reflected in the price increase when compared to the 6 series it replaced. The BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé which has improved rear passenger space dimensions compared to the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupé (F06), is seen as a flashier sportier alternative to its platform-mate, the more traditional BMW 5 Series sedan, and it competes with the Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door Coupé and Porsche Panamera.

In 2022, BMW updated the 8 Series with an updated look and tech. The Iconic Illuminated Glow kidney grille has been added, as is a larger 12.3-inch infotainment system that replaces the 10.25-inch unit.

The M8 Competition Coupe was unveiled in 2020 in the Geneva International Motor Show

<text>Allen Jones (born 1 September 1937) is a British pop artist best known for his paintings, sculptures, and lithography. He was awarded the Prix des Jeunes Artistes at the 1963 Paris Biennale. He is a Senior Academician at the Royal Academy of Arts. In 2017 he returned to his home town to receive the award Honorary Doctor of Arts from Southampton Solent University

Jones has taught at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, the University of South Florida, the University of California, the Banff Center School of Fine Arts in Canada, and the Berlin University of the Arts. His works reside in a number of collections; including the Tate, the Museum Ludwig, the Warwick Arts Centre and the Hirshhorn Museum. His best known work &quot;Hatstand, Table and Chair&quot;, involving fibreglass &quot;fetish&quot; mannequins, debuted to protests in 1970.

==Early life and education==

Jones was born in the English city of Southampton on 1 September 1937. The son of a Welsh factory worker, he was raised in the west London district of Ealing, and in his youth attended Ealing County Grammar School for Boys. Jones had an interest in art from an early age. In 1955, he began studying painting and lithography at Hornsey College of Art in London, where he would graduate in 1959. At the time the teaching method at Hornsey was based on Paul Klee&#x27;s &quot;Pedagogical Sketchbook&quot; from the 1930s. While a student at Hornsey, Jones travelled to Paris and the French region of Provence, and was particularly influenced by the art of Robert Delaunay. He also attended a Jackson Pollock show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1958, and according to Jones, &quot;for me it was outside any known frame of reference. The scale, the ambition, the freedom. I felt like suing my teachers for not telling me what was happening in the world.&quot; He afterwards travelled to see the Musie Fernand Léger in the French commune of Biot, and in 1959 he left Hornsey to begin attending the Royal College of Art.

As one of the first British pop artists, Jones produced increasingly unusual paintings and prints in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and in particular enjoyed combining different visual languages to expose the historical constructions underlying them. According to Jones, about his early ambitions, &quot;I wanted to kick over the traces of what was considered acceptable in art. I wanted to find a new language for representation... to get away from the idea that figurative art was romantic, that it wasn&#x27;t tough.&quot; He was part of a unique generation of students at the Royal College, among which his fellow students were R. B. Kitaj, Peter Phillips, David Hockney, and Derek Boshier, but was expelled from the Royal College of Art in 1960, at the end of his first year. Explained by Mark Hudson in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; many years later, &quot;horrified at the new developments brewing among their younger students, the college&#x27;s academic old guard decided to make an example of someone. They chose Jones.&quot; Dismayed, Jones signed up for a teacher training course and returned to his studies at Hornsey College of Art in 1960, graduating the following year.

==Art career==

===Early teaching and exhibits (1961–63)===
Despite his expulsion from the Royal College, in January 1961 Jones&#x27; work was included in the &quot;Young contemporaries 1961&quot; exhibit. The annual Royal Society of British Artists exhibition was described in the press as &quot;the exhibition that launched British pop art,&quot; &quot;Young Contemporaries&quot; helped expose England to the art of Jones, David Hockney, R. B. Kitaj, Billy Apple, Derek Boshier, Joe Tilson, Patrick Caulfield, and Peter Blake, all of whom were variously influenced by American Pop. Among his works, Jones entered several paintings of London buses on shaped canvases, which were afterwards put on display at the London West End gallery Arthur Tooth &amp; Sons. One of the gallery&#x27;s directors then introduced Jones to the work of American pop artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg, which proved inspirational to Jones. In 1961, he took a job teaching lithography at Croydon College of Art in London, where he would remain until 1963. Around this time, Jones was influenced by the works of writers such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung. According to Jones, his 1963 painting &quot;Hermaphrodite&quot;, depicting &quot;fused male/female couples as metaphors of the creative act,&quot; draws from both Freud and Nietzsche. In 1963, Jones was awarded the Prix des Jeunes Artistes at the Paris Biennale. The following year, Jones and other &quot;Nouveau réalisme&quot; and pop artists such as Peter Phillips and Pauline Boty were featured in documentaries by Belgian director Jean Antoine, Evelyne Axell&#x27;s husband.

===Travel in United States and abroad (1964–69)===

Intrigued by the &quot;toughness&quot; of American pop art, Jones moved to Manhattan in 1964 and took a studio at the Chelsea Hotel. In New York City, Jones recollects learning to &quot;present what you were saying as clearly as possible,&quot; and he developed an interest in making his images tangible. For the year Jones remained in the city, he &quot;discovered a rich fund of imagery in sexually motivated popular illustration of the 1940s and 1950s.&quot; According to Jones, about his art of the time:

Among other projects at the time, Jones &quot;worked on a three-dimensional illusionism with obvious erotic components.&quot; When Jones&#x27; close friend Peter Phillips came to New York on a Harkness Fellowship in 1964, for two years they spent much of their time travelling together throughout the United States. Jones&#x27; style continued to develop, and his 1966 painting &quot;Perfect Match&quot; &quot;made explicit [his] previously subdued eroticism, adopting a precise linear style as a means of emphasizing tactility.&quot;

In 1967, Jones&#x27; work along with the works of artists such as Piero Gilardi and David Hockney were included in an exhibition for the wedding of Guglielmo Achille Cavellini&#x27;s daughter. The following year, when &quot;the xartcollection&quot; exhibition series was created in Zürich, Switzerland, Jones and artists such as Max Bill, Getulio Alviani, and Richard Hamilton were among the first to be included in the company&#x27;s &quot;multiples.&quot; Until it dissolved a few years later, the company&#x27;s philosophy was to make contemporary art available to a large public by industrially producing three-dimensional &quot;multiples,&quot; with several artists&#x27; work included on each. Jones was a guest lecturer at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg in Germany from 1968 to 1970, and in 1969 was also a visiting professor at the University of South Florida. His 1968 set of prints, &quot;Life Class&quot;, was among his first works to incorporate elements of sculpture. Each print is made of two-halves, the bottom being a realistic pair of women&#x27;s legs in tights, while the upper halves are drawn in a 1940s fetishist graphic style representing &quot;the secret face of British male desire in the gloomy post-war years.&quot; About his further experimentation with sculpture, Jones has stated that &quot;I spent so much time giving my figures that grabbable quality, I thought, why don&#x27;t I make them in three dimensions?&quot;

===&quot;Hatstand&quot;, &quot;Table&quot; and &quot;Chair&quot; (1970)===


While living in the London neighbourhood of Chelsea in the late 1960s, Jones began working in sculpture. His fibreglass sculpture &quot;Chair,&quot; which was completed in 1969, marked the start of a series of &quot;life-size images of women as furniture with fetishist and sado-masochist overtones.&quot; The first three sculptures were each sculpted from Jones&#x27; drawings, with Jones overseeing professional sculptor as he produced the figures in clay. The three female figures were then cast in plaster by a company that specialised in producing shop mannequins. Each of the original three figures was produced in an edition of six.
Jones first group of erotic fibreglass sculptures, of a &quot;Hatstand&quot;, &quot;Table&quot; and &quot;Chair&quot; gained international attention when exhibited in 1970. The works were met with strong protests for perceived misogyny, which succeeded in making Jones a &quot;cultural hot potato&quot;. Laura Mulvey writing for &quot;Spare Rib&quot; magazine suggested the sculptures was inspired by latent castration anxiety. Almost a decade later, when they were put on display at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1978, they were attacked with stink bombs. Eight years later, on International Women&#x27;s Day, &quot;Chair&quot; was damaged by paint stripper while exhibited at the Tate. According to art historian and curator, Marco Livingstone, writing in 2004: &quot;More than three decades later, these works still carry a powerful emotive charge, ensnaring every viewer&#x27;s psychology and sexual outlook regardless of age, gender or experience.&quot;

The severe reaction from the art world, feminists, and the mainstream press after the sculptures&#x27; debut would limit Jones&#x27; exhibition career in England over the next several decades. When asked about their effect on his career, Jones was quoted stating &quot;it&#x27;s collateral damage. I wanted to offend the canons of accepted worth in art. I found the perfect image to do that, and it&#x27;s an accident of history that these works coincided with the arrival of militant feminism.&quot; Roman Polanski, Elton John and Gunter Sachs all owned a piece at one stage, with one of the sets selling at auction in 2012 for £2.6 million. The sculptures have also been referenced in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

===&quot;Maîtresse&quot; and teaching (1973–1980s)===

Jones, photographer Brian Duffy, and air brush specialist Philip Castle were commissioned to collaborate on the annual and often salacious Pirelli calendar in 1973, resulting in a unique edition that Clive James would later jokingly call &quot;the only Pirelli Calendar that nobody bothered to look at twice&quot;. In 1973, Jones spent time as a guest lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles, and after visiting Japan in 1974, the following year he toured Canada. Jones designed Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Maîtresse&quot;. Starring Bulle Ogier as the professional dominatrix Ariane and Gérard Depardieu as her obsessed lover, the film was refused a certificate in the United Kingdom because of its graphic depictions of sado-masochism.
By the mid 1970s, he was again focusing on canvas and painting, and among his notable works at this time were &quot;Santa Monica Shores&quot; in 1977. Now at the Tate, the work was painted while he was a guest lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1977, and later that summer he was a visiting director of studies in drawing and painting in Alberta, Canada, at the Banff Center School of Fine Arts. Known for only very occasionally taking on commissions, Jones was commissioned to design a hoarding for Fogal, a hosiery manufacturer, at Basel station in 1978. The Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool held a large retrospective exhibition on his work in 1979, and the exhibit later travelled to the Serpentine Gallery in London. Continuing to travel, he was invited by the Berlin University of the Arts to be a guest professor from 1982 to 1983. By that time, he had largely returned to &quot;a playful stylisation in figure sculptures,&quot; including &quot;The Tango&quot; in 1984, a life-size dancing couple made from steel plate. In 1986, his work was included in the Venice Biennale&#x27;s &quot;Art e Scienza&quot; exhibition, alongside artists such as Brian Eno and Tony Cragg, and that year he was elected as a Royal Academician by the Royal Academy. Opened in 1987, Birch and Conran was the first art gallery in Soho, and their inaugural show featured British Pop artists such as Jones, Sir Peter Blake, Richard Hamilton, and Clive Barker. From 1990 to 1999, he served as a trustee at the British Museum, and in 2000 became an Emeritus Trustee.

He has works held by the Cass Sculpture Foundation. One of which, the outdoor sculpture &quot;Temple&quot; from 1998, was a response to the artifice of cultivated landscape... Jones sought to make a sculpture which used that artifice to distort scale and distance and to manipulate our perception of space. Jones&#x27;s interest derived from eighteenth-century landscape architects, who did this when introducing decorative buildings and follies into their schemes. Also, with the figure at top of the structure Jones uses &quot;colour to introduce the notion of movement in the figure, with the alternate arms of yellow and green in diagonally opposing positions.&quot;

===Recent exhibitions and holdings (2000s)===
Jones continued his artistic activity into the 2000s, and among other projects he incorporated leatherwork by Whitaker Malem. In recent years, Jones has increasingly become known for his large steel sculptures, many of which are abstract in nature and feature intertwining figures. A number of them were displayed in an outdoor exhibit in May 2015 at the Art in the Park event held by Lake Zurich. His work is also included in a number of public and private art collections; three of his paintings are in the collection of the Centro de Arte Moderna of the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, and he has pieces in the Ingram Collection of Modern British Art.

In 2007, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Arts from Southampton Solent University. He has had solo exhibitions at the Wetterling Teo Gallery in Stockholm and the Serge Sorokko Gallery. His works featured in the &quot;Pop Art Portraits&quot; show at the National Portrait Gallery in London, and had a dedicated room of watercolours, drawing and paintings at the Tate Britain. In 2008, he was given a dedicated watercolour room at the Royal Academy of Arts. A large scale, 5-piece sculpture was completed and commissioned at Chatsworth in Derbyshire in 2008, as well as two suspended pieces have been installed at Allen &amp; Overy headquarters in Spitalfields. In April 2013, his work was included in a major exhibition at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, titled &quot;Pop and Abstract&quot;, alongside work by artists like Peter Blake and Bridget Riley. A parody of Jones &quot;Chair&quot; sculpture was part of a collection exhibited under the name &quot;Allen Jones Remake&quot; at the Venus Over Manhattan Gallery in New York in 2013. An example of Jones&#x27; 1969 &quot;Chair&quot; sculpture (as well as over fifty other works) remains at the Tate, which was acquired in 2014. In November 2014, a retrospective on Jones opened at the Royal Academy of Arts, running until January 2015 in London.

==Artistic style and influences==
Associated with the British Pop art movement of the late 1960s, Jones is known for his work with lithography, painting, drawing, and sculpture. The Cass Sculpture Foundation wrote about Jones&#x27; work that &quot;on a flat canvas, painted forms appear sculptural and his three-dimensional works are painterly. He uses colour to describe form, at times with graphic precision, or conversely with an energy and freedom of gesture which is close to direct expression. Similar developments are evident in his printmaking.&quot; The Tate has described his output in lithography as &quot;prolific,&quot; writing that it &quot;proved an appropriate medium for his graphic flair.&quot; Artists and pop fashion designers such as Alexander McQueen, Issey Miyake and Richard Nicoll have cited Jones as an influence on their own styles.

Jones is known for incorporating erotic imagery into his works, including rubber fetishism and BDSM, and this sexuality has often been a focus of both art critics and the press. &quot;Mark Hudson&quot; wrote in 2014 that Jones&#x27; &quot;subjects have included musicians, dancers and London buses, but in the popular perception his name is irrevocably linked to his peerlessly kinky fetish women, whether in two or three dimensions, with their machined surfaces and blank expressions – images that are as emblematic of classic British pop art as Peter Blake&#x27;s Beatles paintings or Hockney&#x27;s swimming pools.&quot; In a review on Jones&#x27; career, Richard Dorment wrote in November 2014 that &quot;you could argue that Jones&#x27;s work isn&#x27;t really about women; it&#x27;s about men and how they look at and think about women. Men use various strategies to neutralise or control desire. One is to fetishise the female body...[while] another is for the man to appropriate it.&quot;

Dorment further explains himself by writing that turn to Jones&#x27;s paintings, and you see that he explores the theme of men transformed into women again and again. A man dancing with a woman becomes inextricably fused into her body; another trades trousers and brogues for stockings and heels, as he walks from one edge of the canvas to the other... Dorment further opines that &quot;the paintings... show men and women in sexual situations, but they are joyous and liberated and self-indulgent in a way that the lugubrious mannequins aren&#x27;t.&quot; Wrote Catrin Davies for &quot;Twin Factory&quot; in November 2014 about the show, Jones&#x27; paintings provide a little counterbalance to the implied misogyny of his sculptures. In these colourfully kitsch scenes he paints about power-play with cross-dressing inferences, of the dominant female, the submissive male, of the animalistic rituals of mating and the delicate interplay of coupling represented in the form of dance.

==Personal life==
Jones lives and works in London, England.

<doc id="747167" wikidata="Q147108" url="?curid=747167" title="Belvedere, London">
<text>Belvedere is a town in south east London, England, within the London Borough of Bexley. It lies close to the River Thames, with Erith to the east, Bexleyheath to the south, and Abbey Wood and Thamesmead to the west. Before the creation of Greater London in 1965, Belvedere was in the administrative county of Kent.

==History==
The area which is today known as Belvedere was for centuries part of Lessness Heath, the eastern parts of a narrow high ridge which stretches from the area of Lesnes Abbey to Erith. The northern stretch is industrial and environmental and was common meadow. In 1847 this largely uncultivated, wooded estate, almost undivided was given by operation of the will of last Lord Saye and Sele to his cousin Sir Culling Eardley, who built properties in Belvedere until his death in 1863. Eardley constructed a large wooden tower (see Belvedere (structure)) on the heath to gain views over his estate to the river Thames, giving the area its name from the Italian &quot;beautiful view&quot;. The name can also be applied today, as the ridge of the area, and parts of its southern uplands, have commanding views towards Canary Wharf and Central London.

Eardley was persuaded to allow the construction on his property, of a Dissenters&#x27; chapel, which was built so that the original wooden belvedere became its tower. In order that the public were able to attend this chapel, he constructed paths to it across Lessness Heath. Eardley had finished in 1861, after nearly 8 years of building, his chapel, now All Saints&#x27; Church, after the earlier chapel with belvedere burned down on the same site. At the same time Eardley constructed Villa Houses and reinforced the heath path to become Erith Road. Belvedere village soon grew up along the path which became Bexley Road (from March 1939 known as Nuxley road after the small heath located 1 km south) as Eardley gradually sold off the land.

Belvedere explosion of 1864
At about 6.40 am on Saturday the first of October 1864 there was a massive explosion which totally destroyed two commercial gunpowder factories, situated in isolation on the Belvedere side of Erith Marshes, along with their store magazines and a couple of barges that were being loaded with barrels of gunpowder at the time. The explosion was heard over a 50 miles radius, and the shock wave was so intense that people in central London were convinced that there had been an earthquake. One report at the time said that as rescuers hurried to the site they found a massive crater and absolutely no signs of any buildings were left “it was if the place had been swept clean by a broom”. There were only around twenty casualties, as though the explosion was huge, the remote location prevented greater loss of life.

;1900 to date
Belvedere was in Kent and formed part of the Municipal Borough of Erith before 1965 and development took place before the Second World War, with significant reconstruction after the Blitz. Despite this, Upper Belvedere and The Village still retains much of its Victorian and Edwardian charm and character. Between 1898 and 1961 Callender&#x27;s Cable Works, at the Erith Works, Belvedere, was patron to Callender&#x27;s Cableworks Band, an amateur brass band made up of employees of the company. The band was a prolific broadcaster on BBC Radio in the 1920s and 1930s.

Flood of 1953

The North Sea Flood of 1953 hit the area of Belvedere Marshes badly, leaving the 1700 gypsies who lived there with nothing. One person died in the flooding and hundreds had their homes damaged. Queen Elizabeth II came to visit the communities of Erith and Belvedere, who were without electricity for weeks, to pay her respects.

Controversy over name

There has been a lot of controversy with local residents over recent years about the correct name of the &quot;village&quot; area of Belvedere incorporating the triangle of Nuxley Road, Albert Road, and Woolwich Road. Council road signs call it Belvedere Village, maps and the post office list the area as Belvedere, but some locals call it Nuxley Village after the road. Many residents informally call the area &quot;The Village&quot;. The origins of Nuxley Village is believed to come from estate agents upselling the area.

==Subdistricts==
Within the ward are:
*Erith Marshes/Crossness Nature Reserve
*Abbey Wood, Bostall Heath and Woods, Lesnes Abbey, Thamesmead, and West Heath.

==Landmarks==
&quot;Upper Belvedere&quot; has a fine church and some fine Victorian and Edwardian brick villas. It has a number of fine pubs, restaurants and retail outlets: &quot;The Eardley Arms&quot; and the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; on Woolwich Road, &quot;The Victoria&quot; on Victoria Street, &quot;The Royal Standard&quot;, &quot;The Village Inn&quot; (formerly the Queens Head) and &quot;The Fox&quot; all on Nuxley road. Upper Belvedere is also home to a large park and a branch library that was in danger of being closed due to central government funding cuts. Fortunately closure threats were averted as a result of the efforts of the local community. A &quot;Splash Park&quot; (opened in 2005, closed in 2016) was a welcome addition to the village, having been developed on the site of the old Victorian paddling pool. The Splash Park retained some of the original paddling pool structures. The Splash Park was closed in 2016 and replaced with a new play area called Belvedere Beach; this opened on 27 July 2017.

&quot;Lower Belvedere&quot; is smaller than Upper Belvedere, more industrial and closer to Belvedere railway station. It has a Methodist chapel and a Sikh Temple. To its north it borders Crossness, an area near the Thames containing a small industrial park, Belvedere Incinerator (a large waste-to-energy plant), and Crossness Sewage Treatment Works with its high technology sludge methane incinerator and Joseph Bazalgette&#x27;s Victorian Crossness Pumping Station. Lower Belvedere is also the location of the Belvedere Community Forum, which runs and meets at Belvedere Community Centre.

The Grade II Listed Bexley College was designed in 1906 by W Egerton in the Queen Anne style and is on residential Erith Road on the last part of the ridge, in the east of the district on the border of Erith.

The Woolwich Road Conservation Area was designated in February 1992, by Bexley Council due to its special Victorian character and high concentration of historical buildings in a small area. The conservation area includes the Eardley Arms public house, Prince of Wales public house, DVLA Driving Test Centre (the original Belvedere Police Station built in the 1880s), Belvedere Recreation Grounds and the large residential villas and semi detached houses along Woolwich Road and Gloucester Road. These houses were for the wealthier Victorian families of the area, possibly for the professional classes or for the managers or owners of the businesses which located in Erith and Woolwich. The former Woolwich Road police station was built in 1881 at a cost of £3386 and designed to blend in with the adjacent houses. Belvedere at that time had a strength of two inspectors, three sergeants, and twenty six constables. It remained an active police station until 1968, when new much larger station was built on the corner of Nuxley Road and Woolwich Road. This remained open until its closure in 2015. In 2018 it was sold for redevelopment for a reported £1.25 million.

==Politics==
There are three councillors for the Belvedere Ward of Bexley London Borough Council. these were Daniel Francis (Labour), Sally Hinkley (Labour) and Esther Amaning (Labour). Belvedere lies within the Erith and Thamesmead constituency (MP Abena Oppong-Asare, Labour, ), and is in the London Assembly constituency of Bexley and Bromley, represented by Peter Fortune (Conservative) .

==Education==
==Sport==
Erith and Belvedere Football Club recently moved to Welling in a ground-sharing arrangement. Belvedere Football Club and Belvedere Cricket Club play at Memorial Sports Ground, Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood and compete in the Kent County League Division One (West).

Bexleyheath and Belvedere Hockey Club are based in Welling, but play some home matches at Erith School.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===
Belvedere railway station, opened in 1859, is in Lower Belvedere and is served by the North Kent Line which runs from London Cannon Street to Dartford/Gravesend/Gillingham (Kent). Belvedere also benefits from the Docklands Light Railway connection at nearby Woolwich, and the long-awaited Elizabeth line to neighbouring Abbey Wood which opened in 2022.

=== Buses ===
Belvedere is served by several Transport for London bus services connecting it with areas including Thamesmead, Erith, Bexleyheath, Woolwich and Sidcup.

=== Green Chain Walk ===
The Green Chain Walk is largely east–west route along the northern slopes of the ridge, stretching from Plumstead Common to Erith, it provides a shortcut to the Thames Path - to which it is linked in three locations.

=== Motoring ===
Driving test statistics from the Driver &amp; Vehicle Standards Agency for the year 2013-14 showed that Belvedere test centre had the lowest pass rate in Great Britain. Between 2022 and 2023 Belvedere test centre had the second lowest pass rate in the country, with nearby Erith having the lowest pass rate in that period.

The proposed Belvedere Crossing across the River Thames would be either a bridge or tunnel between Belvedere and Rainham.

==Geography==
Belvedere borders the River Thames to the north, Erith to the north east and east, Northumberland Heath to the south east and south, West Heath to the south west, Abbey Wood to the west and Thamesmead to the north west.

<text>The Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz () is a public research university in Mainz, Rhineland Palatinate, Germany. It is named after the printer Johannes Gutenberg since 1946. it had approximately 32,000 students enrolled in around 100 academic programs. The university is organized into 11 faculties.

The university is a member of the German U15, a group of fifteen major research and medical universities in Germany. It also participates in the IT-Cluster Rhine-Main-Neckar and forms part of the Rhine-Main-Universities (RMU) along with Goethe University Frankfurt and Technische Universität Darmstadt.

Founded in 1477, it is one of the oldest universities in Europe and one of the most prestigious in Germany.

== History ==
The first University of Mainz goes back to the Archbishop of Mainz, Prince-elector and Reichserzkanzler Adolf II von Nassau. At the time, establishing a university required papal approval and Adolf II initiated the approval process during his time in office. The university, however, was first opened in 1477 by Adolf&#x27;s successor to the bishopric, Diether von Isenburg. In 1784 the university was opened up for Protestants and Jews (curator ). It became one of the largest Catholic universities in Europe with ten chairs in theology alone. In the confusion after the establishment of the Mainz Republic of 1792 and its subsequent recapture by the Prussians, academic activity came to a gradual standstill. In 1798 the university became active again under French governance, and lectures in the department of medicine took place until 1823. Only the faculty of theology continued teaching during the 19th century, albeit as a theological seminary (since 1877 &quot;College of Philosophy and Theology&quot;).
The current Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz was founded in 1946 by the French occupying power. In a decree on 1 March the French military government implied that the University of Mainz would continue to exist: the university shall be &quot;enabled to resume its function&quot;. The remains of anti-aircraft warfare barracks erected in 1938 after the remilitarization of the Rhineland during the Third Reich served as the university&#x27;s first buildings and are still in use today.

The continuation of academic activity between the old university and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, in spite of an interruption spanning over 100 years, is contested. During the time up to its reopening only a seminary and midwifery college survived.

In 1972, the effect of the 1968 student protests began to take a toll on the university&#x27;s structure. The departments (Fakultäten) were dismantled and the university was organized into broad fields of study (Fachbereiche). Finally in 1974 Peter Schneider was elected as the first president of what was now a &quot;constituted group-university&quot; institute of higher education. In 1990 Jürgen Zöllner became university president yet spent only a year in the position after he was appointed Minister for &quot;Science and Advanced Education&quot; for the State of Rhineland-Palatinate. As the coordinator for the SPD&#x27;s higher education policy, this furloughed professor from the Institute for Physiological Chemistry played a decisive role in the SPD&#x27;s higher education policy and in the development of Study Accounts.

== Faculties ==
The Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz is divided in ten faculties since 1 September 2010.

* Faculty of Catholic and Protestant Theology
* Faculty of Social Sciences, Media, and Sports
* Faculty of Law, Management, and Economics
* University Medicine
* Faculty of Philosophy and Philology
* Faculty of Translation Studies, Linguistics, and Cultural Studies
* Faculty of History and Cultural Studies
* Faculty of Physics, Mathematics
* Faculty of Chemistry, Pharmacy and Geosciences
* Faculty of Biology

The academies for music and art are independent art colleges of the Johannes Gutenberg University, the Hochschule für Musik Mainz and the .

== Campus ==
The University of Mainz is one of few campus universities in Germany. Nearly all its institutions and facilities are located on the site of a former barracks in the south west part of the city. The university medical centre is located off campus, as is the Department of Applied Linguistics and Cultural Sciences, which was integrated with the university in 1949 and is located in Germersheim. On campus next to the university is the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, the Institute of Molecular Biology, the electron accelerator MAMI, the research reactor TRIGA, the botanical garden, a sports stadium and an indoor swimming pool. Mainz Academy of Arts (&quot;Kunsthochschule Mainz&quot;) is located off campus.

== Academic profile ==
The range of studies is comprehensive; the university lacks some technical studies, veterinary medicine and nutrition science. One can nonetheless study the theology, history of books, athletics, music, visual arts, theatre, and film.

Today the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz has approximately 36,000 students () and consists of over 150 institutions and clinics. The university offers international programs, such as the award-winning choir EuropaChorAkademie, founded by Joshard Daus in 1997, in collaboration with the University of the Arts Bremen.

One of the instruments carried by the Mars Exploration Rovers &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;, a miniature Mössbauer spectrometer, was developed at the university.

The University of Mainz does not currently levy fees or tuition (&quot;Studiengebühren&quot;) for a regular course of study. Senior citizen students, auditing students, and certain postgraduate students may be subject to fees.

==Rankings==

As per the QS World University Rankings for 2024, the university holds the 464th position worldwide and is placed 27th nationally. On the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, it finds itself within the 251–300 range globally, and falls within the 25–31 range on a national scale in the 2024 edition. In terms of the ARWU World Rankings for 2022, the university is positioned in the 201–300 band internationally, and ranks between 10th and 19th in the country.

According to the report of the German Research Foundation (DFG) from 2018, the University of Mainz is one of the best universities in natural sciences in Germany. In the period under review from 2014 to 2016, the University of Mainz received the highest number of competitive grants in the natural sciences. The university also achieved the first place in physics. In a competitive selection process, the DFG selects the best research projects from researchers at universities and research institutes and finances them. The ranking is thus regarded as an indicator of the quality of research.

<text>Barrancabermeja () is a municipality and city in Colombia, located on the shore of the Magdalena River, in the western part of the department of Santander. It is home to the largest oil refinery in the country, under direct management of ECOPETROL. Barrancabermeja is known as the Oil Capital of Colombia.

It is located 114 km west of Bucaramanga, on the banks of the Magdalena River in the Middle Magdalena region, which is the largest municipality and second in the entire department.

Barrancabermeja has high temperatures all year round. It is considered to be one of the hottest cities in Colombia. It is surrounded by water resources which make it very humid.

==History==
On February 23, 2022, Barrancabermeja was affected by a 5.5 Richter Scale magnitude earthquake.

==Geography==
Puerto Wilches lies to the north of Barrancabermeja; Puerto Parra and Simacota to the south; San Vicente de Chucuri and Giron to the southeast; and Magdalena River to the west. It is 116 km from Bucaramanga, the capital of Santander.
The city is situated on the banks of the Magdalena River. In the past a Ferry service would cross between Santander and Antioquia, on the opposite side, where further oil fields are found. A bridge now spans the river at this location.

===Climate===
Barrancabermeja has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with heavy rainfall in all months except January.

==Culture==
Barrancabermeja&#x27;s culture has been largely affected by the migratory movements caused by the oil boom. The city exhibits an amalgam of many regional customs from Colombia. Due to its history as an oil town, the city is often visited by moneyed foreigners, often engineers and supervisory employees and technicians of oil companies. Thus Barrancabermeja has a reputation as an open and vibrant city and may be somewhat cosmopolitan.

Barrancabermeja&#x27;s night life includes Salsa and merengue dance clubs. The city&#x27;s culture presents a strong Caribbean influence that nevertheless is not exclusive of other cultural expressions from among the variety found in Colombia. The predominant music in the city is vallenato and other Caribbean rhythms including papayera.

Several local and national political organizations including unions, women&#x27;s organizations, and human rights groups are active. Marches and demonstrations are quite common and the oil workers union is among the most important in the nation.

The commercial area of the city is adjacent to the river port (&quot;the Port&quot;) where motor boats and canoes constantly arrive with fish and agricultural products from farmers along the river that include maize, cassava (or &quot;yuca&quot; in Spanish), plantain, and cacao.

In 1996 and 2000, Barrancabermeja hosted the Mundial de Patinaje, an international inline-skating competition.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Yariguíes Airport.

<doc id="747188" wikidata="Q130966" url="?curid=747188" title="Spinosaurus">
<text>Spinosaurus (; ) is a genus of large spinosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in what now is North Africa during the Cenomanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, about 100 to 94 million years ago. The genus was known first from Egyptian remains discovered in 1912 and described by German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915. The original remains were destroyed in World War II, but additional material came to light in the early 21st century. It is unclear whether one or two species are represented in the fossils reported in the scientific literature. The type species S. aegyptiacus is mainly known from Egypt and Morocco. Although a potential second dubious species, S. maroccanus, has been recovered from Morocco, this dubious species is likely a junior synonym of &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot;. Other possible junior synonyms include &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; from the Kem Kem beds in Morocco and &quot;Oxalaia&quot; from the Alcântara Formation in Brazil, though other researchers propose both genera to be distinct taxa.

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; is the longest known terrestrial carnivore; other large carnivores comparable to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; include theropods such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; and the coeval &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;. The most recent study suggests that previous body size estimates are overestimated, and that &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot; reached in length and in body mass. The skull of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was long, low, and narrow, similar to that of a modern crocodilian, and bore straight conical teeth with no serrations. It would have had large, robust forelimbs bearing three-fingered hands, with an enlarged claw on the first digit. The distinctive neural spines of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, which were long extensions of the vertebrae (or backbones), grew to at least long and were likely to have had skin connecting them, forming a sail-like structure, although some authors have suggested that the spines were covered in fat and formed a hump. The hip bones of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; were reduced, and the legs were very short in proportion to the body. Its long and narrow tail was deepened by tall, thin neural spines and elongated chevrons, forming a flexible fin or paddle-like structure.

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; is known to have eaten fish and small to medium terrestrial prey as well. Evidence suggests that it was semiaquatic; how capable it was of swimming has been strongly contested. &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;&#x27;s leg bones had osteosclerosis (high bone density), allowing for better buoyancy control. Multiple functions have been put forward for the dorsal sail, including thermoregulation and display; either to intimidate rivals or attract mates. It lived in a humid environment of tidal flats and mangrove forests alongside many other dinosaurs, as well as fish, crocodylomorphs, lizards, turtles, pterosaurs, and plesiosaurs.

==Discovery and naming==

===Naming of species===
Two species of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; have been named: &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; (meaning &quot;Egyptian spine lizard&quot;) and the disputed &quot;Spinosaurus maroccanus&quot; (meaning &quot;Moroccan spine lizard&quot;). The first described remains of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; were found and described in the early 20th century. In 1912, Richard Markgraf discovered a partial skeleton of a giant theropod dinosaur in the Bahariya Formation of western Egypt. In 1915, German paleontologist Ernst Stromer published an article assigning the specimen to a new genus and species, &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;.

Fragmentary additional remains from Bahariya, including vertebrae and hindlimb bones, were designated by Stromer as &quot;Spinosaurus B&quot; in 1934. Stromer considered them different enough to belong to another species, and this has been borne out. With the advantage of more expeditions and material, it appears that they pertain either to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; or to &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot;.

&quot;S. maroccanus&quot; was originally described by Dale Russell in 1996 as a new species based on the length of its neck vertebrae. Specifically, Russell claimed that the ratio of the length of the centrum (body of vertebra) to the height of the posterior articular facet was 1.1 in &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot; and 1.5 in &quot;S. maroccanus&quot;. Later authors have been split on this topic. Some authors note that the length of the vertebrae can vary from individual to individual, that the holotype specimen was destroyed and thus cannot be compared directly with the &quot;S. maroccanus&quot; specimen, and that it is unknown which cervical vertebrae the &quot;S. maroccanus&quot; specimens represent. Therefore, though some have retained the species as valid without much comment, most researchers regard &quot;S. maroccanus&quot; as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; (dubious name) or as a junior synonym of &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot;. Some studies have referred the holotype and other referred specimens of &quot;S. maroccanus&quot; (NMC 50791 and MNHN SAM 124–128) as &quot;S.&quot; cf. &quot;aegyptiacus&quot;. The specimens previously ascribed as paratypes of &quot;S. maroccanus&quot; (NMC 41768 and NMC 50790) are reidentified as indeterminate spinosaurid specimens that are currently not identifiable at the generic level.

===Specimens===
Six main partial specimens of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; have been described. BSP 1912 VIII 19, described by Stromer in 1915 from the Bahariya Formation, was the holotype. The material consisted of the following items, most of which were incomplete: right and left dentaries and splenials from the lower jaw measuring long; a straight piece of the left maxilla that was described but not drawn; 20 teeth; 2 cervical vertebrae; 7 dorsal (trunk) vertebrae; 3 sacral vertebrae; 1 caudal vertebra; 4 thoracic ribs; and gastralia. Of the nine neural spines whose heights are given, the longest (&quot;i,&quot; associated with a dorsal vertebra) was in length. Stromer claimed that the specimen was from the early Cenomanian, about 97 million years ago.

It was destroyed in World War II, specifically &quot;during the night of 24/25 April 1944 in a British bombing raid of Munich&quot; that severely damaged the building housing the Paläontologisches Museum München (Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology). However, detailed drawings and descriptions of the specimen remain. Stromer&#x27;s son donated Stromer&#x27;s archives to the Paläontologische Staatssammlung München in 1995, and Smith and colleagues analyzed two photographs of the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; holotype specimen BSP 1912 VIII 19 discovered in the archives in 2000. On the basis of a photograph of the lower jaw and a photograph of the entire specimen as mounted, Smith concluded that Stromer&#x27;s original 1915 drawings were slightly inaccurate. In 2003, Oliver Rauhut suggested that Stromer&#x27;s &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; holotype was a chimera, composed of vertebrae and neural spines from a carcharodontosaurid similar to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; and a dentary from &quot;Baryonyx&quot; or &quot;Suchomimus&quot;. The analysis was rejected in at least one subsequent paper.

NMC 50791, held by the Canadian Museum of Nature, is a mid-cervical vertebra which is long from the Kem Kem Beds of Morocco. It is the holotype of &quot;Spinosaurus maroccanus,&quot; as described by Russell in 1996. Other specimens referred to &quot;S. maroccanus&quot; in the same paper were two other mid-cervical vertebrae (NMC 41768 and NMC 50790), an anterior dentary fragment (NMC 50832), a mid-dentary fragment (NMC 50833), and an anterior dorsal neural arch (NMC 50813). Russell stated that &quot;only general locality information could be provided&quot; for the specimen, and therefore it could be dated only &quot;possibly&quot; to the Albian.

MNHN SAM 124, housed at the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, is a snout (consisting of partial premaxillae, partial maxillae, vomers, and a dentary fragment). Described by Taquet and Russell in 1998, the specimen is in width; no length was stated. The specimen was located in Algeria, and &quot;is of Albian age.&quot; Taquet and Russell believed that the specimen, along with a premaxilla fragment (SAM 125), two cervical vertebrae (SAM 126–127), and a dorsal neural arch (SAM 128), belonged to &quot;S. maroccanus&quot;. Although it was originally ascribed to &quot;S. maroccanus&quot;, based on their examination of this cranial material, the 2016 study considered the difference between the two species to be not taxonomically significant and either ontogenetic or intraspecific, and thus tentatively assigned the specimen to &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot;. The 2017 study considered MNHN SAM 124 to belong to same taxon as MSNM V4047.

BM231 (in the collection of the Office National des Mines, Tunis) was described by Buffetaut and Ouaja in 2002. It consists of a partial anterior dentary in length from an early Albian stratum of the Chenini Formation of Tunisia. The dentary fragment, which included four alveoli and two partial teeth, was &quot;extremely similar&quot; to existing material of &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot;.

UCPC-2 in the University of Chicago Paleontological Collection consists mainly of two narrow connected nasals with a fluted (ridged) crest from the region between the eyes. The specimen, which is long, was located in an early Cenomanian part of the Moroccan Kem Kem Beds in 1996 and described in the scientific literature in 2005 by Cristiano Dal Sasso of the Civic Natural History Museum in Milan and colleagues.

MSNM V4047 (in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano), described by Dal Sasso and colleagues in 2005 as &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; cf. &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot;, consists of a snout (premaxillae, partial maxillae, and partial nasals) long from the Kem Kem Beds. An isolated fish vertebra, tentatively referred to &quot;Onchopristis&quot;, has been associated with the tooth alveolus of this specimen. Similarly, the dentary fragment of &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;, MPDM 31, is associated with the rostral tooth of &quot;Onchopristis&quot;. Like UCPC-2, it is thought to have come from the early Cenomanian. Arden and colleagues in 2018 tentatively assigned this specimen to &quot;Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis&quot; given its size. However, this assignment was later rejected by other researchers who considered the uniqueness of this specimen to be based on misinterpretations and poor preservation of another specimen, NHMUK R16665, another snout stored that is stored in the Natural History Museum, London.

FSAC-KK 11888 is a partial subadult skeleton recovered from the Kem Kem beds of North Africa. It was described by Ibrahim and colleagues in 2014 and designated as the neotype specimen, though Evers and colleagues rejected the neotype designation for FSAC-KK-11888 in 2015. It includes cervical vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae, neural spines, a complete sacrum, femora, tibiae, pedal phalanges, caudal vertebra, several dorsal ribs, and fragments of the skull. The body proportions of the specimen have been debated, as the hind limbs are disproportionately shorter in the specimen than in previous reconstructions. However, it has been demonstrated by multiple paleontologists that the specimen is not a chimera, and is indeed a specimen of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; that suggests that the animal had much smaller hind limbs than previously thought.

Other known specimens consist mainly of very fragmentary remains and scattered teeth. These include:

* A 1986 paper described prismatic structures in tooth enamel from two &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; teeth from Tunisia.
* Buffetaut (1989, 1992) referred three specimens from the Institut und Museum für Geologie und Paläontologie of the University of Göttingen in Germany to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;: a right maxilla fragment IMGP 969–1, a jaw fragment IMGP 969–2, and a tooth IMGP 969–3. These had been found in a Lower Cenomanian or Upper Albian deposit in southeastern Morocco in 1971.
* Kellner and Mader (1997) described two unserrated spinosaurid teeth from Morocco (LINHM 001 and 002) that were &quot;highly similar&quot; to the teeth of the &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot; holotype.
* Teeth from the Chenini Formation in Tunisia which are &quot;narrow, somewhat rounded in cross-section, and lack the anterior and posterior serrated edges characteristic of theropods and basal archosaurs&quot; were assigned to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; in 2000.
* Material possibly belonging to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; from the Turkana Grits of Kenya has been noted in 2004.
*Teeth from the Echkar Formation of Niger were tentatively referred to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; in 2007.
* A partial tooth long purchased at a fossil trade show, reportedly from the Kem Kem Bed of Morocco and attributed to &quot;Spinosaurus maroccanus&quot;, showed wide longitudinal striations and micro-structures (irregular ridges) among the striations in a 2010 paper.
* Isolated teeth attributed to &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot; are reported from Algeria in 2015.
* Pedal ungual (MSNM V6894), cervical vertebra (FSAC-KK-7280) and dorsal vertebra (FSAC-KK-18118) from the Kem Kem beds are referred to juvenile cf. &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;.
MHNM.KK374, MHNM.KK375, MHNM.KK376, MHNM.KK377, MHNM.KK378 and MSNM V6896 are six isolated quadrates (skull bones) of different sizes that were collected by locals and acquired commercially in the Kem Kem region of southeastern Morocco, provided by François Escuillié and are deposited in the collections of the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle of Marrakech. Only MHNM.KK376 is assigned to &quot;Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis&quot;, while the other five specimens are assigned to &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot;, since the quadrates show two different morphologies, suggesting the existence of two spinosaurines in Morocco. However, a 2020 study on variation within &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; considers these differences in morphology to be indicative of variation in skull morphology within a single species, as is the case in &quot;Allosaurus.&quot;

===Possible synonyms===
====&quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot;====
Some scientists have considered the genus &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; a junior synonym of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. In Ibrahim and colleagues (2014), the specimens of &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; was referred to &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; together with &quot;Spinosaurus B&quot; as the neotype and &quot;Spinosaurus maroccanus&quot; was considered as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; following the conclusions of the other papers. A 2015 re-description of &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; disputed these conclusions, and considered the genus valid, with inclusion of &quot;S. maroccanus&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; instead. This conclusion was further supported in 2018 by Arden and colleagues, who consider &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; to be a distinct genus, though a very close relative of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, the two unified in the tribe Spinosaurini, coined in the study.

The 2020 study indicates synonymy between &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot;, and considered specimens previously referred to &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; as those of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. For instance, the referral of an isolated quadrate (specimen MHNM.KK376) to &quot;Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis&quot;, based on its difference from other specimens assigned to &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;, was rejected by the 2020 study which noted that these differences in morphology are indicative of variation in skull morphology within a single species. The 2019 study assigned a juvenile specimen FSAC-KK-18122 to &quot;Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis&quot; based on its identical proportion to BSPG 2011 I 115 which was assigned to the taxon in a 2015 study, but this referral was also rejected in a 2020 study based on the fact that the median tubercle and median suture is present in BSPG 2011 I 115 but absent in FSAC-KK-18122, so the presence or absence of such feature should not be used to taxonomically separate isolated spinosaurid remains.

Regardless of the synonymy of &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; with &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, some authors consider the possibility that there could be a second distinct spinosaurid in North Africa during the Cenomanian age. Additionally, in 2024, a complete posterior cervical vertebra (specimen NHMUK PV R 38358) was assigned to &quot;Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis&quot;.

====&quot;Oxalaia&quot;====
Since the National Museum of Brazil fire in 2018 engulfed the palace housing the museum, with specimens of &quot;Oxalaia&quot; possibly being destroyed, any classification should remain tentative. It was noted by paleontologist Rodrigo Vargas Pêgas in 2025 that the badly damaged remains of &quot;Oxalaia&quot; were recovered, and the publication for the recovered items is in preparation.

In a 2020 paper written by Symth &quot;et al.&quot; in assessing spinosaurine specimens from the Kem Kem Group suggested the Brazilian spinosaurine &quot;Oxalaia&quot; to be a potential junior synonym of &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;. This was based on looking at the specimens assigned to &quot;Oxalaia&quot;, and the supposed autapomorphies of this taxon to be insignificant and fall within the hypodigm of &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;. If supported by future studies, this would imply &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; had a wider distribution and supports the faunal exchange between South America and Africa during this time.

However, subsequent studies have rejected the synonymy of &quot;Oxalaia&quot; with &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; based on diagnostic features of the holotype (MN 6117-V) and the referred specimen (MN 6119-V). In 2021, Lacerda, Grillo and Romano noted that the anteromedial processes of the holotype maxillae (MN 6117-V) contact medially, a condition not observed in MSNM V4047 which has been referred to as a specimen of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and thus adding a new possible diagnostic feature of &quot;Oxalaia&quot;. They also suggested that the premaxilla of &quot;Oxalaia&quot; is wider in the posterior portion than that of MSNM V4047, and that the lateral morphology of its rostrum was distinguished from other spinosaurines based on their morphometric analysis. In 2023, Isasmendi and colleagues considered &quot;Oxalaia&quot; as a valid taxon based on the examination of its referred maxilla (MN 6119-V) which suggests that the position of its external naris would have been more anteriorly located, a condition similar to that of &quot;Irritator&quot; and baryonychines, differing from African spinosaurines including &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;.

==Description==
=== Size ===
Since its discovery, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; has been a contender for the largest theropod dinosaur. Both Friedrich von Huene in 1926 and Donald F. Glut in 1982 listed it as among the most massive theropods in their surveys, at in length and upwards of in weight. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul also listed it as the longest theropod at , but gave a lower mass estimate of .

In 2005, Dal Sasso and colleagues assumed that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and the related &quot;Suchomimus&quot; had the same body proportions in relation to their skull lengths, and thereby calculated that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was in length and in weight. The estimates were criticized because the skull length estimate was uncertain, and (assuming that body mass increases as the cube of body length) scaling &quot;Suchomimus,&quot; which was long and in mass, to the range of estimated lengths of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; would produce an estimated body mass of .

François Therrien and Donald Henderson, in a 2007 paper using scaling based on skull length, challenged previous estimates of the size of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, finding the length too great and the weight too small. Based on estimated skull lengths of , their estimates include a body length of and a body mass of . The lower estimates for &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; would imply that the animal was shorter and lighter than &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;. The Therrien and Henderson study has been criticized for the choice of theropods used for comparison (e.g., most of the theropods used to set the initial equations were tyrannosaurids and carnosaurs, which have a different build than spinosaurids), and for the assumption that the &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; skull could be as little as in length.

In 2014, Ibrahim and his colleagues suggested that &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; could reach over in length. In 2022, however, Paul Sereno and his colleagues suggested that &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; reached a maximum body length of and a maximum body mass of by constructing a CT-based 3D skeletal model &quot;with the axial column in neutral pose.&quot; They argued that the 2D graphical reconstruction of the aquatic hypothesis by Ibrahim and his colleagues in 2020 overestimated the presacral column length by 10%, ribcage depth by 25%, and forelimb length by 30% over dimensions based on CT-scanned fossils; these proportional overestimates shift the center of mass anteriorly when translated to a flesh model, and thus the estimate from Ibrahim and his colleagues cannot be considered a reliable body size estimate.

===Skull===


Its skull had a narrow snout filled with straight conical teeth that lacked serrations. There were six or seven teeth on each side of the very front of the upper jaw, in the premaxillae, and another twelve in both maxillae behind them. The second and third teeth on each side were noticeably larger than the rest of the teeth in the premaxilla, creating a space between them and the large teeth in the front of the maxilla; large teeth in the lower jaw faced this space. The very tip of the snout holding those few large front teeth was expanded, and a small crest was present in front of the eyes. Using the dimensions of three specimens known as MSNM V4047, UCPC-2, and BSP 1912 VIII 19, and assuming that the postorbital part of the skull of MSNM V4047 had a shape similar to the postorbital part of the skull of &quot;Irritator&quot;, Dal Sasso and colleagues (2005) estimated that the skull of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was long, but more recent estimates suggest a length of . The Dal Sasso and colleagues skull length estimate is questioned because skull shapes can vary across spinosaurid species and because MSNM V4047 may not belong to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; itself, though recent studies have reconfirmed it as a specimen of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;.

===Postcranial skeleton===
As a spinosaurid, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; would have had a long, muscular neck, curved in a sigmoid, or S-shape. Its shoulders were prominent, and the forelimbs large and stocky, bearing three clawed digits on each hand. The first finger (or &quot;thumb&quot;) would have been the largest. &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had long phalanges (finger bones), and only somewhat recurved claws, suggesting that its hands were longer compared to those of other spinosaurids.

Very tall neural spines growing on the back vertebrae of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; formed the basis of what is usually called the animal&#x27;s &quot;sail&quot;. The lengths of the neural spines reached over 10 times the diameters of the centra (vertebral bodies) from which they extended. The neural spines were slightly longer front to back at the base than higher up, and were unlike the thin rods seen in the pelycosaur finbacks &quot;Edaphosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, contrasting also with the thicker spines in the iguanodontian &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot;.

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; sails were unusual, although other dinosaurs, namely &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot;, which lived a few million years earlier in the same general region as &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and the Early Cretaceous South American sauropod &quot;Amargasaurus,&quot; might have developed similar structural adaptations of their vertebrae. The sail may be an analog of the sail of the Permian synapsid &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, which lived before the dinosaurs even appeared, produced by convergent evolution.

The structure may also have been more hump-like than sail-like, as noted by Stromer in 1915 (&quot;one might rather think of the existence of a large hump of fat German: &quot;Fettbuckel&quot;], to which the [neural spines] gave internal support&quot;) and by Jack Bowman Bailey in 1997. In support of his &quot;buffalo-back&quot; hypothesis, Bailey argued that in &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ouranosaurus&quot;, and other dinosaurs with long neural spines, the spines were relatively shorter and thicker than the spines of pelycosaurs (which are known to have sails); instead, the dinosaurs&#x27; neural spines were similar to the neural spines of extinct hump-backed mammals such as &quot;Megacerops&quot; and &quot;Bison latifrons&quot;. In 2014, Ibrahim and colleagues instead posited that the spines were covered tightly by skin, similar to a crested chameleon, given their compactness, sharp edges, and likely poor blood flow.

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had a significantly smaller pelvis (hip bone) than that of other giant theropods, with the surface area of the ilium (main body of the pelvis) half that of most members of the clade. The hind limbs were short, at just over 25 percent of the total body length, with the tibia (calf bone) being longer than the femur (thigh bone). Unlike in other theropods, the hallux (or fourth toe) of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; touched the ground, and the phalanges of the toe bones were unusually long and well-built. At their ends were shallow claws that had flat bottoms. This type of foot morphology is also seen in shorebirds, indicating that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;&#x27;s feet evolved for walking across unstable substrate and that they may have been webbed.

From the caudal vertebrae of the tail projected significantly elongated, thin neural spines, akin to the condition observed in some other spinosaurids, though to a more extreme degree. Coupled with the also elongated chevron bones on the underside of the caudals, this resulted in a deep and narrow tail with a paddle or fin-like shape, comparable to the tails of newts and crocodilians.

==Classification==

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; gives its name to the dinosaur family Spinosauridae, which includes two subfamilies: Baryonychinae and Spinosaurinae. Baryonychinae includes &quot;Baryonyx&quot; from southern England and &quot;Suchomimus&quot; from Niger in central Africa. Spinosaurinae includes &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Siamosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ichthyovenator&quot;, &quot;Irritator&quot;, &quot;Angaturama&quot; (which may be synonymous with &quot;Irritator&quot;), &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; and &quot;Oxalaia&quot; (both of which may be synonymous with &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;). The spinosaurines share unserrated straight teeth that are widely spaced (e.g., 12 on one side of the maxilla), as opposed to the baryonychines, which have serrated curved teeth that are numerous (e.g., 30 on one side of the maxilla).

An analysis of Spinosauridae by Arden and colleagues (2018) named the clade Spinosaurini and defined it as all spinosaurids closer to &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; than to &quot;Irritator challengeri&quot; or &quot;Oxalaia quilombensis&quot;; it also found &quot;Siamosaurus suteethorni&quot; and &quot;Icthyovenator laosensis&quot; to be members of Spinosaurinae.

=== Phylogeny ===
The subfamily Spinosaurinae was named by Sereno in 1998, and defined by Holtz and colleagues (2004) as all taxa closer to &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; than to &quot;Baryonyx walkeri&quot;. The subfamily Baryonychinae was named by Charig &amp; Milner in 1986. They erected both the subfamily and the family Baryonychidae for the newly discovered &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, before it was referred to Spinosauridae. Their subfamily was defined by Holtz and colleagues in 2004, as the complementary clade of all taxa closer to &quot;Baryonyx walkeri&quot; than to &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot;. Examinations by Marcos Sales, Cesar Schultz, and colleagues (2017) indicate that the South American spinosaurids &quot;Angaturama&quot;, &quot;Irritator&quot;, and &quot;Oxalaia&quot; were intermediate between Baronychinae and Spinosaurinae based on their craniodental features and cladistic analysis. This indicates that Baryonychinae may in fact be non-monophyletic. Their cladogram can be seen below.


The cladogram below depicts the findings of Arden and colleagues (2018):

==Paleobiology==

===Function of neural spines===

The function of the dinosaur&#x27;s sail or hump is uncertain; scientists have proposed several hypotheses including heat regulation and display. In addition, such a prominent feature on its back could make it appear even larger than it was, intimidating other animals.

The structure may have been used for thermoregulation. If the structure contained abundant blood vessels, the animal could have used the sail&#x27;s large surface area to absorb heat. This would imply that the animal was only partly warm-blooded at best and lived in climates where night-time temperatures were cool or low and the sky usually not cloudy. It is also possible that the structure was used to radiate excess heat from the body, rather than to collect it. Large animals, due to the relatively small ratio of surface area of their body compared to the overall volume (Haldane&#x27;s principle), face far greater problems of dissipating excess heat at higher temperatures than gaining it at lower. Sails of large dinosaurs added considerably to the skin area of their bodies, with minimum increase of volume. Furthermore, if the sail was turned away from the sun, or positioned at a 90 degree angle towards a cooling wind, the animal would quite effectively cool itself in the warm climate of Cretaceous Africa. However, Bailey (1997) was of the opinion that a sail could have absorbed more heat than it radiated. Bailey proposed instead that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and other dinosaurs with long neural spines had fatty humps on their backs for energy storage, insulation, and shielding from heat.

Many elaborate body structures of modern-day animals serve to attract members of the opposite sex during mating. It is possible that the sail of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock&#x27;s tail. Stromer speculated that the size of the neural spines may have differed between males and females.
Gimsa and colleagues (2015) suggest that the dorsal sail of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was analogous to the dorsal fins of sailfish and served a hydrodynamic purpose. Gimsa and others point out that more basal, long-legged spinosaurids had otherwise round or crescent-shaped dorsal sails, whereas in &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, the dorsal neural spines formed a shape that was roughly rectangular, similar in shape to the dorsal fins of sailfish. They therefore argue that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; used its dorsal neural sail in the same manner as sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern thresher shark. Sailfish employ their dorsal fins for herding schools of fish into a &quot;bait ball&quot; where they cooperate to trap the fish into a certain area where the sailfish can snatch the fish with their bills.
The sail could have possibly reduced yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash as suggested by Gimsa and colleagues (2015).

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; anatomy exhibits another feature that may have a modern analogy: its long tail resembled that of the thresher shark, employed to slap the water to herd and stun shoals of fish before devouring them (Oliver and colleagues, 2013).
The strategies that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish are more effective when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette &amp; Facey, 1997; Oliver and colleagues, 2013; Domenici and colleagues, 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder &amp; Drucker, 2004). Domenici and colleagues (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey is less likely to recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras and colleagues, 2015; Webb &amp; Weihs 2015).

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; exhibited the anatomical features required to combine all three hunting strategies: a sail for herding prey more efficiently, as well as flexible tail and neck to slap the water for stunning, injuring or killing prey. The submerged dorsal sail would have provided a strong centreboard-like counterforce for powerful sidewards movements of the strong neck and long tail, as performed by sailfish (Domenici and colleagues, 2014) or thresher sharks (Oliver and colleagues, 2013). While smaller dorsal sails or fins make the dorsal water volume better accessible for slashing, it can be speculated that their smaller stabilization effect makes lateral slashing less efficient (e.g. for thresher sharks). Forming a hydrodynamic fulcrum and hydrodynamically stabilizing the trunk along the dorsoventral axis, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;’ sail would also have compensated for the inertia of the lateral neck by tail movements and vice versa not only for predation but also for accelerated swimming. This behavior might also have been one reason for &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;’ muscular chest and neck reported by Ibrahim and colleagues (2014).

===Diet and feeding===
It is unclear whether &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was primarily a terrestrial predator or a piscivore, as indicated by its elongated jaws, conical teeth and raised nostrils. The hypothesis of spinosaurs as specialized fish eaters has been suggested before by A. J. Charig and A. C. Milner for &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. They base this on the anatomical similarity with crocodilians and the presence of digestive acid-etched fish scales in the rib cage of the type specimen. Large fish are known from the faunas containing other spinosaurids, including the &quot;Mawsonia&quot;, in the mid-Cretaceous of northern Africa and Brazil. Direct evidence for spinosaur diet comes from related European and South American taxa. &quot;Baryonyx&quot; was found with fish scales and bones from juvenile &quot;Iguanodon&quot; in its stomach, while a tooth embedded in a South American pterosaur bone suggests that spinosaurs occasionally preyed on pterosaurs, but &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was likely to have been a generalized and opportunistic predator, possibly a Cretaceous equivalent of large grizzly bears, being biased toward fishing, though it undoubtedly scavenged and took many kinds of small or medium-sized prey.
In 2009, Dal Sasso and colleagues. reported the results of X-ray computed tomography of the MSNM V4047 snout. As the foramina on the outside all communicated with a space on the inside of the snout, the authors speculated that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had pressure receptors inside the space that allowed it to hold its snout at the surface of the water to detect swimming prey species without seeing them. A 2013 study by Andrew R. Cuff and Emily J. Rayfield concluded that bio-mechanical data suggests that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was not an obligate piscivore and that its diet was more closely associated with each individual&#x27;s size. The characteristic rostral morphology of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; allowed its jaws to resist bending in the vertical direction, but its jaws were poorly adapted with respect to resisting lateral bending compared to other members of this group (&quot;Baryonyx&quot;) and modern alligators. This suggests that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; preyed more regularly on fish than it did on land animals, although considered predators of the former too. In 2022, Sakamoto estimated that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had an anterior bite force of 4,829 newtons and a posterior bite force of 11,936 newtons. Based on this estimate, he asserted that the jaws of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; are adapted for generating relatively faster shutting speeds with less muscle input force, indicating that the animal likely killed its prey with fast-snapping jaws rather than slow-crushing bites, a trait commonly observed in animals which have a semi-aquatic feeding habit.

A 2024 paper suggests that Spinosaurus and other spinosaurines in addition to fish also preyed upon small to medium-sized terrestrial vertebrates, and had relatively weak bite forces compared to those of other theropods.

=== Aquatic habits ===
A 2010 isotope analysis by Romain Amiot and colleagues found that oxygen isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth, including teeth of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, indicate semiaquatic lifestyles. Isotope ratios from tooth enamel and from other parts of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; (found in Morocco and Tunisia) and of other predators from the same area such as &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study found that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; teeth from five of six sampled localities had oxygen isotope ratios closer to those of turtles and crocodilians when compared with other theropod teeth from the same localities. The authors postulated that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; switched between terrestrial and aquatic habitats to compete for food with large crocodilians and other large theropods respectively. A 2018 study by Donald Henderson, however, refutes the claim that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was semiaquatic. By studying the buoyancy in lungs of crocodilians and comparing it to the lung placement in &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, it was discovered that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; could not sink or dive below the water surface. It was also capable of keeping its entire head above the water surface while floating, much like other non-aquatic theropods. Furthermore, the study found that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had to continually paddle its hind legs to prevent itself from tipping over onto its side, something that extant semiaquatic animals do not need to perform. Henderson therefore theorized that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; probably did not hunt completely submerged in water as previously hypothesized, but instead would have spent much of its time on land or in shallow water.

Recent studies of the tail vertebrae of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; refute Henderson&#x27;s proposal that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; mainly inhabited areas of land near and in shallow water and was too buoyant to submerge. Studies of the tail, thanks to fossils recovered and analyzed by Ibrahim, Pierce, Lauder, and Sereno and colleagues in 2018 indicate that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had a keeled tail that was well adapted to propelling the animal through water. The elongated neural spines and chevrons, which run to the end of the tail on both dorsal and ventral sides, indicate that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was able to swim in a similar manner to modern crocodilians. Through experimentation by Lauder and Pierce, the tail of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was found to have eight times as much forward thrust as the tails of terrestrial theropods like &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, as well as being twice as efficient at achieving forward thrust. The discovery indicates that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; may have had a lifestyle comparable to modern alligators and crocodiles, remaining in water for long periods of time while hunting.

David Hone and Thomas Holtz published a paper in 2021 in which they argue that the anatomy of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; is more consistent with a shoreline generalist lifestyle rather than an active aquatic pursuit predator as suggested by Ibrahim. They highlight the positioning of the nostrils and orbits as one reason why a crocodile-like lifestyle is unlikely: they are ventrally positioned in such a way that the whole head would have to be lifted inefficiently out of the water in order to breathe. Additionally, they argue that the general body shape of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; is poorly adapted for this lifestyle, drawing on the amount of water drag and aquatic instability from the sail, as well as the rigid trunk and seemingly scarcely-muscled tail. Animals like crocodilians require a flexible body in order to move through the water and make sharp turns when chasing prey, and this is directly contradicted by Hone and Holtz&#x27;s findings.

A 2022 study by Fabbri &quot;et al.&quot;, made comparisons of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;″ bone structure and compared it to that of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot;. The study revealed that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Baryonyx&quot; had dense bones, which allowed them to dive and pursue prey underwater. Compared to these, &quot;Suchomimus&quot; had more hollow bones, suggesting it preferred to hunt in shallow water. These findings also suggest that various spinosaurid genera were more ecologically disparate than previously believed, as some were better suited to hunting in subaqueous environments than other, closely related genera.

In the same year, contradicting the study by Fabbri and colleagues, Sereno and his colleagues suggested that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was wholly bipedal on land and an unstable, slow moving surface swimmer in deep water. Their results, taken from reconstructing a CT model of the skeleton, and then adding internal air and muscles. Their results, coupled with fossils from &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; that showed it also lived further inland along rivers and lakes, suggest it was a semi-aquatic, ambush piscivore that preferred waterside environments both along the coasts and further inland along rivers and lakes. Simultaneously, they suggested that the large tail fin was probably utilized more for display than swimming, as tails in living animals have the same function when they possess comparably tall neural spines.

A 2024 paper by Myrhvold &quot;et al&quot;. also contends that Spinosaurus and Baryonyx were diving pursuit predators. Instead they also argue that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Baryonyx&quot; hunted more like herons instead of diving after prey. Another paper in the same year analyzed the linear measurements of the skull of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and concluded that the skull morphology and hunting method of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; would likely be the most similar to those of wading birds like herons, though the authors noted that they&#x27;re uncertain how beneficial the skull would have been for the diving pursuit predation method.

===Locomotion and posture===
Although traditionally depicted in the scientific community as a biped, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was occasionally depicted in the mid-20th century as an obligate quadruped akin to &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. Starting in the mid-1970s, it was hypothesized &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was at least an occasional quadruped, bolstered by the discovery of &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. Theropods, including spinosaurids, could not pronate their hands (rotate the forearm so the palm faced the ground), but a resting position on the side of the hand was possible, as shown by fossil prints from an Early Jurassic theropod. The hypothesis that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had a typical quadrupedal gait since fell out of favor, however it was still believed that spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture, due to biological and physiological constraints.
The possibility of a quadrupedal &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was revived by a 2014 paper by Ibrahim and colleagues that described new material of the animal. The paper found that the hind limbs of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; were much shorter than previously believed, and that its center of mass was located in the midpoint of the torso region, as opposed to near the hip as in typical bipedal theropods. It was therefore proposed that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was poorly adapted for bipedal terrestrial locomotion, and must have been an obligate quadruped on land. The reconstruction used in the study was an extrapolation based on different sized individuals, scaled to what were assumed to be the correct proportions. Paleontologist John Hutchinson of the Royal Veterinary College of the University of London has expressed skepticism to the new reconstruction, and cautioned that using different specimens can result in inaccurate chimaeras. Scott Hartman also expressed criticism because he believed the legs and the pelvis were inaccurately scaled (27% too short) and didn&#x27;t match the published lengths. However, Mark Witton expressed agreement with the proportions reported in the paper. In their 2015 re-description of &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot;, Evers and colleagues argued that &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; was in fact a distinct genus from &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and therefore doubted whether the material assigned to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; by Ibrahim &quot;et al.&quot; should be assigned to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; or &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot;. In 2018, an analysis by Henderson found that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; probably was competent at bipedal terrestrial locomotion; the center of mass was instead found to be close to the hips, allowing &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; to stand upright like other bipedal theropods.

A 2024 article co-authored by Sereno stated that the previous calculations by Sereno that were used to argue quadrupedality for &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had erroneously shifted the center of mass in front of the hips. They instead suggested that the dinosaur fit the criteria of being a graviportal (or slow-moving) biped.

===Ontogeny===
An ungual phalanx measuring belonging to a very young juvenile cf. &quot;S. aegyptiacus&quot; indicates that the theropod developed its semiaquatic adaptations at a very young age or at birth and maintained them throughout its life. The specimen, found in 1999 and described by Simone Maganuco and Cristiano Dal Sasso and colleagues, is believed to have come from an animal measuring (assuming it resembled a smaller version of the adult), making it the smallest specimen of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; currently known.

=== Palaeopathology ===
A cf. &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; sp. tooth from the Ifezouane Formation displays enhanced lingual curvature to the tooth&#x27;s crown, the development of three deep grooves extending from crown root junction in the direction of the crown&#x27;s apex, an attenuated carina that does not extend apically nor to the base of the tooth, and a wear facet at the tip.

== Paleoenvironment ==
The environment inhabited by &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; is only partially understood, and covers a great deal of what is now northern Africa. The region of Africa &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; is preserved in dates from 112 to 93.5 million years ago. A specimen tentatively referred to as cf. &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; has been found in the Campanian Quseir Formation of Egypt, but no detailed description of the specimen was provided and now reclassified as Theropoda indet. A 1996 study concluded from Moroccan fossils that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Deltadromeus&quot; &quot;ranged across north Africa during the late Cretaceous (Cenomanian).&quot; Those &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; that lived in the Bahariya Formation of what is now Egypt may have contended with shoreline conditions on tidal flats and channels, living in mangrove forests alongside similarly large dinosaurian predators &quot;Bahariasaurus&quot; and &quot;Tameryraptor&quot; (originally assigned to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;), the titanosaur sauropods &quot;Paralititan&quot; and &quot;Aegyptosaurus&quot;, crocodylomorphs, bony and cartilaginous fish, turtles, lizards, and plesiosaurs. In the dry season it might have resorted to preying on pterosaurs. This situation resembles that in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America, which boasts up to five theropod genera over in weight, as well as several smaller genera (Henderson, 1998; Holtz &quot;and colleagues&quot;, 2004). Differences in head shape and body size among the large North African theropods may have been enough to allow niche partitioning as seen among the many different predator species found today in the African savanna (Farlow &amp; Pianka, 2002).

== In popular culture ==

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; appeared in the 2001 film &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, replacing &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; as the main antagonist. The film&#x27;s consulting paleontologist John R. Horner was quoted as saying, &quot;If we base the ferocious factor on the length of the animal, there was nothing that ever lived on this planet that could match this creature [&quot;Spinosaurus&quot;]. Also my hypothesis is that T-rex was actually a scavenger rather than a killer. &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was really the predatory animal.&quot; He has since retracted the statement about &quot;T. rex&quot; being a scavenger. In the film, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; was portrayed as larger and more powerful than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;: in a scene depicting a battle between the two resurrected predators, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; emerges victorious by snapping the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;″ neck. In the fourth film, &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, there is a nod to this fight where the &quot;T. rex&quot; smashes through the skeleton of a &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; in the climactic fight near the end of the film. The Spinosaurus would appear in many Jurassic Park games most notably &quot;Jurassic World Evolution&quot;, and its sequel. The same &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; from the third film returns in the fourth, and fifth season of &quot;Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous&quot;, this time battling two &quot;T. rex&quot;.

&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; has long been depicted in popular books about dinosaurs, although only recently has there been enough information about spinosaurids for an accurate depiction. After an influential 1955 skeletal reconstruction by Lapparent and Lavocat based on a 1936 diagram by Stromer, it has been treated as a generalized upright theropod, with a skull similar to that of other large theropods and a sail on its back, even having four-fingered hands.

In addition to films, action figures, video games, and books, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; has been depicted on postage stamps from countries such as Angola, The Gambia, and Tanzania.

<text>John Ringo (born March 22, 1963) is an American science fiction and military fiction author. He has had several &quot;New York Times&quot; best sellers. His books range from straightforward science fiction to a mix of military and political thrillers. He has over seven million copies of his books in print, and his works have been translated into seven different languages.

==Life and career==
Ringo&#x27;s father &quot;was a civil engineer with an international firm&quot;; before Ringo graduated in 1981 from Winter Park High School in Winter Park, Florida, he had spent time in 23 foreign countries, attending classes at fourteen schools. Among the countries he spent the most time in were Greece, Iran and Switzerland before he settled with his parents and six siblings in Alabama. This amount of travel brought what he refers to as a &quot;wonderful appreciation of the oneness of humanity and a permanent aversion to foreign food.&quot;

After graduation, Ringo joined the United States Army and rose to the rank of Specialist in the 82nd Airborne Division. During his four years of active duty, he was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, reflagged into 3rd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment when the 82nd reorganized its 3rd Brigade, plus two years of reserve duty with the Florida National Guard. Among his awards are the Combat Infantryman Badge, Parachutist Badge, Army Commendation Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for his participation in the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada, and the National Defense Service Medal.

After discharge, Ringo earned an associate degree in marine biology. However, he quickly discovered that marine biology would only &quot;pay for beans&quot; and became a database manager to support his wife and two daughters. In 1999, he had the idea for a science fiction story that involved an alien invasion and a military response that became the novel &quot;A Hymn Before Battle&quot;, the title referring to Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;Hymn Before Action&quot;, quoted extensively throughout the book. He submitted the novel to Baen Books. The book was initially rejected, but the publisher Jim Baen, through his discussion with Ringo on the Baen&#x27;s Bar website forum, personally took a look at the novel and quickly bought it.

The success of the book and its sequels allowed Ringo to quit his job and become a full-time writer. As of 2015, John Ringo had written 46 novels, some with co-authors David Weber, Michael Z. Williamson, Julie Cochrane, Linda Evans, Travis S. Taylor, and Tom Kratman. One of the appeals of his works is his inclusion of fans&#x27; names into novels as &quot;red shirts&quot; who die gloriously. He also has often integrated elements of the 82nd Airborne into his works: 2nd Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry in &quot;A Hymn Before Battle&quot;, his old 1/508th Parachute Infantry in &quot;Yellow Eyes&quot;, and the 555th &quot;Triple Nickels/Black Panthers&quot; in &quot;Gust Front&quot; and its sequels.

He has also written a number of op-ed pieces for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, and been a guest commentator for Fox News and National Geographic.

In 2012, he was presented with the Phoenix Award at DeepSouthCon 50 in Huntsville, Alabama, in recognition of his contributions to science fiction literature.

Ringo is considered the originator of the anti–political correctness slogan &quot;get woke, go broke&quot;, citing political tensions in a fan convention following the 2000 United States presidential election and declining interest in organizations that embrace progressive cultural shifts. The term suggests that organizations that embrace social justice initiatives (&quot;getting woke&quot;) will drive away significant, mostly conservative or apolitical fans and their interests, and thus lose money (&quot;going broke&quot;).

In March of 2023 John Ringo started his own substack &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Tavern&quot; for his writing. Saying he wanted to continue doing traditional publishing but also nature of publishing was changing this was his way of changing with it.

The main characters in &quot;Claws That Catch&quot; also play &quot;Return&quot; in order to defeat the aliens. The book &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; quotes the song of the same name a few times. In the novel &quot;Von Neumann&#x27;s War&quot;, the song &quot;Citadel&quot; is the anthem of the soldiers and it is played during the final showdown. The &quot;Black Tide Rising&quot; series also quotes the Crüxshadows extensively.

<text>Robert Arthur &quot;Robin&quot; Riddles, CBE, MIMechE, MinstLE (23 May 1892 – 18 June 1983) was a British locomotive design engineer.

==Biography==
===LNWR and LMS===
Riddles was born in 1892 in East Preston in Worthing, Sussex. His father was a contractors&#x27; manager. He attended St Andrew&#x27;s High School, Worthing. Riddles entered the Crewe Works of the London and North Western Railway as a premium apprentice in 1909, completing his apprenticeship in 1913. While attending the Mechanics Institute classes he took a course in electrical engineering, feeling there would be a future for electric traction. During the 1914–18 Great War he served with the Royal Engineers mainly in France, during which time he was badly wounded.

He returned to the LNWR at Crewe and, in 1920, became the &quot;bricks and mortar assistant&quot;, with responsibility for the new erecting shop. When work on that was stopped, Riddles was placed in charge of a small production progress department and was sent to Horwich to study the methods used by the L&amp;Y. From that, Riddles gained some backing and had significant influence in the re-organisation of Crewe, which took place between 1925 and 1927.
In 1923, the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway so, on completion of the work at Crewe, Riddles was sent to the ex-Midland Railway works at Derby, by then part of the LMS, to initiate a similar arrangement. In that task, he had the active support of the then Derby works manager, H. G. Ivatt.
During the nine-day General Strike in May 1926, Riddles volunteered as a driver, taking trains from Crewe to Manchester and Carlisle. The experience gained made him almost unique among CMEs, and he maintained that the practical knowledge he gained from driving a locomotive was an invaluable aid to his design work.

In 1933, Riddles moved to Euston to become Locomotive Assistant to the new Chief Mechanical Engineer, Sir William Stanier and, in 1935, became Stanier&#x27;s Principal Assistant. In 1937, Riddles moved to Glasgow as Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineer - Scotland, the first to combine both engineering disciplines in a single title. However, Riddles was disappointed that C. E. Fairburn was appointed as Stanier&#x27;s Deputy.

===Ministry of Supply===

In 1939, with the Second World War having just started, he moved to the Ministry of Supply, becoming &quot;Director of Transportation Equipment&quot;, and later designed the WD Austerity 2-8-0 and WD Austerity 2-10-0 locomotives.

===Return to LMS===
In 1943, he moved to the post of Chief Stores Superintendent at the LMS - it has been said that he was anxious to get back into the railway business. On the death of Charles Fairburn in 1944, he applied for the position of Chief Mechanical Engineer, but the job went to George Ivatt, with Riddles being promoted to vice-president of the LMS.

===British Railways===
Upon the creation of the Railway Executive in 1947, in preparation for the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, he was appointed Member of the Railway Executive for Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. He had two principal assistants, both of whom were also former LMS men: Roland C. Bond, Chief Officer (Locomotive Construction and Maintenance), and E. S. Cox, Executive Officer (Design). The duties of the three effectively covered the old post of Chief Mechanical Engineer and they subsequently oversaw the design of the British Railways (BR) standard classes.

===Locomotive Designs===

Locomotive designs introduced by Riddles include:
*BR Standard Class 9F, 2-10-0 
*BR Standard Class 8, 4-6-2 
*BR Standard Class 7 Britannia Class, 4-6-2
*BR Standard Class 6 Clan Class, 4-6-2
*BR Standard Class 5, 4-6-0
*BR Standard Class 4, 4-6-0
*BR Standard Class 4 2-6-0
*BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T
*BR Standard Class 3 2-6-0
*BR Standard Class 3 2-6-2T
*BR Standard Class 2 2-6-0
*BR Standard Class 2 2-6-2T
*WD Austerity 2-8-0
*WD Austerity 2-10-0

===Retirement===
Riddles retired in 1953, on the abolition of the Railway Executive, and became a director of Stothert &amp; Pitt of Bath, Cranemakers.

Riddles was succeeded as Chief Mechanical Engineer of BR by Roland Bond.

<doc id="747200" wikidata="Q728944" url="?curid=747200" title="Inclusion (mineral)">
<text>In mineralogy, an inclusion is any material trapped inside a mineral during its formation. In gemology, it is an object enclosed within a gemstone or reaching its surface from the interior. According to James Hutton&#x27;s law of inclusions, fragments included in a host rock are older than the host rock itself.

==Mineralogy==
Inclusions are usually rocks or other minerals, less often water, gas or petroleum. Liquid and vapor create fluid inclusions. In amber, insects and plants are common inclusions.

The analysis of atmospheric gas bubbles as inclusions in ice cores is an important tool in the study of climate change.

A xenolith is a preexisting rock which has been picked up by a lava flow. Melt inclusions form when bits of melt become trapped inside crystals as they form in the melt.

==Gemology==

Inclusions are one of the most important factors when it comes to gem valuation. They diminish the clarity and value of many gemstones, such as diamonds, and increase the value of others, such as star sapphires.

Many colored gemstones are expected to have inclusions which do not greatly affect their values. They are categorized into three types:

*Type I colored gems, such as aquamarines, topaz and zircon, have very few or no inclusions.
*Type II colored gems, such as sapphire, ruby, garnet and spinel, often have a few inclusions.
*Type III colored gems, such as emerald and tourmaline, almost always have inclusions.

==Metallurgy==

The term &quot;inclusion&quot; is also used in the context of metallurgy and metals processing. During the melt stage of processing particles such as oxides can enter or form in the liquid metal which are subsequently trapped when the melt solidifies. The term is usually used negatively such as when the particle could act as a fatigue crack nucleator or as an area of high stress intensity.

<text>Bucaramanga () is the capital and largest city of the department of Santander, Colombia. Bucaramanga has the fifth-largest economy by GDP in Colombia, has the lowest unemployment rate and is the ninth most populous city in the country, with a population of 613,400 (2023 projection). Bucaramanga has over 160 parks scattered throughout the city and has been given the nickname &quot;La Ciudad de Los Parques&quot; (&quot;The City of Parks&quot;) and &quot;La Ciudad Bonita de Colombia&quot; (&quot;Colombia&#x27;s Beautiful City&quot;).

Bucaramanga has grown rapidly since the 1960s, mostly into neighbouring locations within the metropolitan area. Floridablanca, Girón and Piedecuesta are inextricably linked geographically and commercially with Bucaramanga, and now all form together the Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area with a population of 1,304,288.

The city is the base of the Colombian Petroleum Institute (ICP), the research branch of the state oil company Ecopetrol.

==History==

Girón was the first and most significant town founded by Spanish colonialists in the region, and Bucaramanga (founded on 22 December 1622) did not overtake Girón in population or economic significance until the early 19th century. Bucaramanga was born as an indigenous town since the economic activity that occurred for the first time in the area was the extraction of gold from the alluvial deposits that predominated in the region, mainly due to what is known as the La Rosita ravine. Until 1778, Bucaramanga was considered an indigenous town and it was in 1779 when it began to be called a Parish. The name it took was the Parish of Our Lady of Chiquinquira and San Laureano de la Real de Minas de Bucaramanga. The city attracted a core of German merchants and adventurers in the 1860s and 1870s (the most famous of whom was Geo von Lengerke) and tensions between the newcomers and local merchants flared in 1879, when the event named &quot;La Culebra Pico de Oro&quot; (&quot;The Gold Beak Snake&quot;) occurred. With the political reorganization of 1886, Bucaramanga replaced Socorro as the departmental capital. The region (although not the city itself) was devastated by the civil war of 1899–1902—commonly known as the Thousand Days War—causing Bucaramanga to grow only modestly in the first half of the 20th century.

==Climate==
Bucaramanga is located on a plateau in the Cordillera Oriental of the Colombian Andes, and many residents occupy unstable lands descending steeply from the &quot;meseta&quot;. Westbound of it, the Rio de Oro Canyon is located at an altitude of above sea level. Eastbound, the Andean Range rises up in high peaks, reaching almost AMSL in the place locally known as &quot;Paramo de Berlin&quot;.
The city is located at . The official metropolitan area includes the municipalities of: Girón, Piedecuesta and Floridablanca, but Lebrija is home to Bucaramanga&#x27;s airport and is commonly considered part of greater Bucaramanga. Despite recent urbanization, all four neighboring municipalities contain extensive rural areas.

Under the Köppen climate classification, Bucaramanga features a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot; in Köppen climate classification), though a noticeably cool version of the climate. The city is slightly too dry for a tropical rainforest climate, as its driest month of December averages just under of rainfall. Although its altitude is not considered very high, Bucaramanga&#x27;s climate is neither hot nor cold, 22 degrees Celsius being the average temperature. Compared to cities at the same average altitude (such as Cali), Bucaramanga has much cooler daytime temperatures, owing to the cold wind coming down the eastern peaks; its night temperatures are not cold, owing to the warm air coming from the canyon. These phenomena make the daily thermal oscillation narrower than in other Colombian cities.

==Municipal flag==
The municipal flag of Bucaramanga was designed by the historian Gustavo Gómez Mejía. Made of two green stripes with a yellow one in the middle. In the center, there&#x27;s a blue disk, surrounded by a red circle. In the middle of the blue disk, there&#x27;s a white star. In the red circle the following legend: &quot;Below the azure of its sky and defended by the generous blood of its sons, Bucaramanga is opened to the four horizons of the motherland&quot; is written.

==Municipal coat of arms==

The words &quot;Montani Semper Liberi&quot; are Latin for &quot;Mountaineers are Always Free&quot;. This is also used as the official motto for the U.S. State of West Virginia.

== Demography ==
According to the data obtained from the 2018 census and information provided by the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga, the city has an estimated population of 681,130 inhabitants.

Of the total population, 47.5% are men and 52.5% women. The average number of occupants per household is 3.6 people. 16.6% of people of the population are 10 years of age or younger. Of all cohabiting couples in the city, 46.3% were single, 26.7% were married, 5.8% were separated and 4.6% were widowed. 9.2% of the resident population aged over 4 years are from another municipality, and 0.3% from another country.

In the city, 39% of people live in houses, while 56.7% live in apartments and 4.3% in a leased room or other.

==Economy==

=== Industry ===

An industrial activity developed in Bucaramanga that has gained national recognition is the footwear industry. For this reason, the Footwear Manufacturers&#x27; Association (Asoinducals) is located in the city. The footwear sector has a major market nationally and internationally in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, Italy, some Caribbean islands, United States, Peru, Venezuela and Mexico. 

There is also a big clothing industry. There are a growing number of technological research centers in various topics such as energy, gas, oil, corrosion, asphalt, leather and agro-industrial development tools, among others.

The Chimitá Industrial Zone is located in the western area of the plateau near the town of Girón; many companies from different specialties like Terpel have production plants there. Also in the city is one of the main production plants of Cervecería Bavaria S.A. (Bavaria Brewery). The city is planning to build the Zona Franca de Santander, a customs-free zone located within the metropolitan area of Bucaramanga. 

Bucaramanga has positioned itself as a city of congresses and events, having infrastructures like Fair and Exhibition Centre - CENFER, many fairs, and exhibitions in all branches of the national economic sectors are performed there annually.

The city also has a polyfunctional center for events and shows, which gives a space for performing great shows, puzzle games, sports, and business. A number of meeting rooms and conferences allow Bucaramanga to hold conventions for entrepreneurs around the country.

The trade fairs, as well as direct benefits to the respective sector, have benefits in other areas of the economy such as transport, hotels, restaurants, shops and various services activities such as advertising, design and decoration, modeling, etc.

The International Exhibition of Children&#x27;s Fashion (EIMI) takes place in Bucaramanga. It is the only exhibition specialized in children&#x27;s clothing in Latin America. The event is organized in the CENFER complex and 40% of the sales generated come from exported products.

=== Business ===
In recent years, several major shopping centers and commercial buildings have been built in Bucaramanga. An example is the shopping center La Florida, a six-storey mall with two pedestrian bridges and one vehicular bridge. A newer shopping center, Megamall, was built in 2007, where the first store of the French multinational retailer Carrefour opened in the city. 

In the following years, three more shopping centers were built in other areas of the city: Cacique, Parque Caracolí, and De la Cuesta. Another shopping district known as &quot;Cabecera del Llano&quot; includes five major shopping centers: Cabecera Etapa I, Etapa II and Etapa III, as well as the more recognized Cabecera Etapa IV and the shopping center &quot;La Quinta&quot; or V Etapa. 

The Acropolis Shopping Center is located in an area known as Ciudadela Real de Minas, while the San Andresito commercial center and the traditional and renovated (2005) Cañaveral shopping center are located in the southern sector of the city along with the El Cacique shopping center, opened in November 2012 and considered one of the largest in Latin America. 

In these shopping centers, there are several movie theaters of major companies such as Cine Colombia, Cine Royal and Cinemark, clothing stores like Adidas, Levi&#x27;s, and national brands such as Arturo Calle, restaurants and cafes as Presto, El Corral, McDonald&#x27;s, Crêpes &amp; Waffles, Juan Valdez.

One of the largest hypermarket chains in Colombia, Exito, has five stores throughout the city and a distribution center for eastern Colombia. 

Carrefour opened in 2007 the first store at Megamall, merging later with a local supermarket named Mercadefam. The chain now has seven stores in the city. Along with this, there are local small chain stores in Bucaramanga such as Mercomfenalco, Cootracolta, Cajasan, and others.
=== Labor market ===
Historically, Bucaramanga has had one of the lowest rates of unemployment among Colombian cities. As of September 2010, according to DANE statistics between July and September 2010, the city had an unemployment rate of 11.8%, increasing by 3.3% compared to October and December 2009 which showed a rate of 8.5%.

==== Transport ====
Metrolínea is the Integrated Mass Transit System of Bucaramanga. Its construction began in 2006 during the administration of Mayor Honorio Galvis; its operation is currently in its first phase, which began on 22 December 2009. The six lines inaugurated in this phase are: Avenida del Libertador (Diagonal 15), autocentral, Prospero Finch Avenue (27th Avenue), La Cumbre, Highway Floridablanca Villabel Bucarica and which have 91 stopways. The administration is currently in the process of coupling the second phase, which will cover the areas of Piedecuesta, Ciudadela Real de Minas, the Avenue of the Americas (Race 33) and will have trunks at Autosur, Real de Minas and the Americas.

==== National road connection ====
Bucaramanga is connected to the mainland by two main routes. The first is the National Route 66 which comes from Barrancabermeja and Cucuta communicates with and then into Venezuela, the second the Ruta Nacional 45A that comes from Bogotá and San Alberto comes up this road connects with the Colombian Caribbean region and major cities across the Ruta Nacional 45.

=== Air transport ===

The international airport serving Bucaramanga is Palonegro International Airport, located on the hill of Palonegro, west of the metropolitan area and close to the town of Lebrija.

The airport opened in 1974, replacing the old airport Gómez Niño located in the Ciudadela Real de Minas. The airport currently operates under the administration of the Palonegro consortium Colombo-Korean SAS East Airports Group. There are daily flights from most major cities in Colombia, as well as international flights from the city of Panama.

In 2009, Palonegro International Airport was ranked among Colombia&#x27;s most important airports.

==People==
Many important Colombian people are from Bucaramanga, such as Luis Carlos Galán, presidential candidate murdered in 1989, Carlos Ardila Lülle, one of the most important businessmen in Colombia, Claudia Florez and Ivan Garzón.

Colombian artist Oscar Rodríguez Naranjo came back from France during the Second World War and settled in Bucaramanga. Rodríguez Naranjo taught at the art school while he made a number of paintings that would build up his reputation in Colombia. In 1941 he became the Director of the Academia de Bellas Artes in Bucaramanga.

==Education==
The city has a good reputation due to its numerous universities, among them:
Industrial University of Santander (&quot;Universidad Industrial de Santander&quot;)

The Universidad Industrial de Santander is an official institution that offers 95 degrees and a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses within the health sciences, humanities, sciences, and engineering colleges. Also, it offers seven technological programs in different fields through the Distance Learning Institute. Nowadays, after 71 years of existence, there are nearly 14,000 students registered in undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as a total 22,000 alumni. It proudly stands as the leading higher education institution in the northeastern part of the country and ranks fourth among official universities nationwide. Also, the University has created affiliate branches in Barrancabermeja—home of the most important oil refinery in the country—El Socorro and Málaga. Recently it has extended its services to Barranquilla and Bogotá through the offer of its Graduate Programs.

*Universidad de Santander (UDES)
*Unidades Tecnológicas de Santander (UTS)
*Saint Thomas Aquinas University (&quot;Universidad Santo Tomás&quot;)
*Pontifical Bolivarian University (&quot;Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana&quot;)

== Culture ==
Bucaramanga&#x27;s culture has several expressions, from the visual arts such as painting, sculpture, photography, and recently also in experimental demonstrations that incorporate new technology for artistic communication, such as video. Throughout Bucaramanga&#x27;s history, it has hosted many cultural offerings in various areas, causing arts groups to form within the city.

One of the main pillars of culture in Bucaramanga is literature, as in the past there was a local cultural movement that produced a number of writers.

In 1995, the administration of Mayor Luis Fernando Peña Cote decided to convert Gabriel Turbay Public Library to hold the newly created Municipal Institute of Culture, assigning the library building to Gabriel Turbay, who has overseen space management for the institute, which has meant the movement of areas of the library to use the administrative area of the Municipal Institute of Culture. The creation of the Municipal Institute of Culture was conceived in order to expand the possibilities for sponsoring culture in the metropolitan area. But as culture has not traditionally played a leading role in local government, colleges do not receive sufficient funding and incentives to fulfill their purposes.

The Institute provides library services, art workshops, and a variety of shows and cultural work from the different neighborhoods of the city. The city sponsors these cultural activities with private investment. Bucaramanga also features a cultural radio station (Station Cultural Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento) on 100.7 FM.

=== Gastronomy ===
Typical dishes from Bucaramanga include mute santandereano (a soup made from various grains, vegetables, herbs and meat), fricassee, a preparation of viscera and goat blood mixed with white rice, roasted meat, arepa de maize pelado, and tamales.

Also popular are caramels and candied items such as celery, lemon, citrón, rice, and pineapple. Most sweets are produced in the Floridablanca neighboring. The oblea, (a large, Holy communion-like wafer), and bocadillo veleño (a type of fudge made from puréed fruit or pressed caramel, or dulce de leche/milk caramel), are examples of treats found in great quantity in Bucaramanga. 

Nevertheless, one of the most exotic foods in this Colombian city is undoubtedly the “hormigas culonas”, or “big-butt ants”, which have made Bucaramanga famous nationally and internationally; the speciality has even been exported to Tokyo and London. These ants have a naturally high protein content, and their consumption among local peoples dates from well before the colonial era. This delicacy is only available seasonally, due to the ants only emerging from underground during the months of May and June.

<doc id="747210" wikidata="Q728497" url="?curid=747210" title="Snob">
<text>Snob is a pejorative term for a person who feels superior due to their social class, education level, or social status in general; it is sometimes used especially when they pretend to belong to these classes. The word &quot;snobbery&quot; came into use for the first time in England during the 1820s.

== Examples ==

Snobs can through time be found ingratiating themselves with a range of prominent groups — soldiers (Sparta, 400 BCE), bishops (Rome, 1500), poets (Weimar, 1815) — for the primary interests of snobs is a distinction, and as its definition changes, so, naturally and immediately, will the objects of the snob&#x27;s admiration.

Snobbery existed also in medieval feudal aristocratic Europe when the clothing, manners, language, and tastes of every class were strictly codified by customs or law. Geoffrey Chaucer, a poet moving in the court circles, noted the provincial French spoken by the Prioress among the Canterbury pilgrims:

And French she spoke full fair and fetisly&lt;br&gt;
After the school of Stratford atte Bowe,&lt;br&gt;
For French of Paris was to her unknowe.
William Rothwell notes &quot;the simplistic contrast between the &#x27;pure&#x27; French of Paris and her &#x27;defective&#x27; French of Stratford atte Bowe that would invite disparagement&quot;.

Snobbery surfaced more strongly as the structure of the society changed, and the bourgeoisie had the possibility to &quot;imitate&quot; aristocracy. Snobbery appears when elements of culture are perceived as belonging to an aristocracy or elite, and some people (the snobs) feel that the mere adoption of the fashion and tastes of the elite or aristocracy is sufficient to include someone in the elites, upper classes or aristocracy.

==Snob victim==
The term &quot;snob&quot; is often misused when describing a &quot;gold-tap owner&quot;, i.e. a person who insists on displaying (sometimes non-existent) wealth through conspicuous consumption of luxury goods such as clothes, jewelry, cars etc. Displaying awards or talents in a rude manner, boasting, is a form of snobbery. A popular example of a &quot;snob victim&quot; is the television character Hyacinth Bucket of the BBC comedy series &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;.

== Analysis ==
William Hazlitt observed, in a culture where deference to class was accepted as a positive and unifying principle, &quot;Fashion is gentility running away from vulgarity, and afraid of being overtaken by it,&quot; adding subversively, &quot;It is a sign the two things are not very far apart.&quot; The English novelist Bulwer-Lytton remarked in passing, &quot;Ideas travel upwards, &quot;manners&quot; downwards.&quot; It was not the deeply ingrained and fundamentally accepted idea of &quot;one&#x27;s betters&quot; that has marked snobbery in traditional European and American culture, but &quot;aping one&#x27;s betters&quot;.

Snobbery is a defensive expression of social insecurity, flourishing most where an establishment has become less than secure in the exercise of its traditional prerogatives, and thus it was more an organizing principle for Thackeray&#x27;s glimpses of British society in the threatening atmosphere of the 1840s than it was of Hazlitt, writing in the comparative social stability of the 1820s.

==Snobbatives==
Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann proposes the term &quot;snobbative&quot; to refer to a pretentious, highfalutin phrase used by a person in order to sound snobbish. The term derives from &quot;snob&quot; + &quot;-ative&quot;, modelled upon comparatives and superlatives. Thus, in its narrow sense, a &quot;snobbative&quot; is a pompous (phonetic) variant of a word. Consider the following hypercorrect pronunciations in Israeli Hebrew:

#&quot;khupím&quot; is a snobbative of &quot;khofím&quot; (), which means &quot;beaches&quot;;
#&quot;tsorfát&quot; is a snobbative of &quot;tsarfát&quot; (), which refers to &quot;France&quot;;
#amán&quot; is a snobbative of omán&quot; (), which means &quot;artist&quot;.

A non-hypercorrect example in Israeli Hebrew is &quot;filozófya&quot;, a snobbative of &quot;filosófya&quot; (), which means &quot;philosophy&quot;. The snobbative &quot;filozófya&quot; (with &quot;z&quot;) was inspired by the pronunciation of the Israeli Hebrew word by German Jewish professors of philosophy, whose speech was characterized by intervocalic voicing of the &quot;s&quot; as in their German mother tongue.

<text>The Magdalena River (, ; less commonly ) is the main river of Colombia, flowing northward about through the western half of the country. It takes its name from the biblical figure Mary Magdalene. It is navigable through much of its lower reaches, in spite of the shifting sand bars at the mouth of its delta, as far as Honda, at the downstream base of its rapids. It flows through the Magdalena River Valley.

Its drainage basin covers a surface of , which is 24% of the country&#x27;s area and where 66% of its population lives.

== Course ==

The Magdalena River is the largest river system of the northern Andes, with a length of 1,612 km. Its headwaters are in the south of Colombia, where the Andean subranges Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental separate, in Huila Department. The river runs east then 
north in a great valley between the two cordilleras. It reaches the coastal plain at about nine degrees north, then runs west for about , then north again, reaching the Caribbean Sea at the city of Barranquilla in the zone known as Bocas de Ceniza.

The Magdalena River Valley was formed after a series of tectonic formed depressions that filled up with continental sediment in the Tertiary period. These sediments came from the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The Magdalena Valley, subdivided into the Upper (VSM), Middle (VMM) and Lower Magdalena Valleys (VIM), is an important area for oil exploration in Colombia.

== Flora and fauna ==
=== Fish ===
The Magdalena River basin, which includes the Cauca River and other tributaries, are very rich in fish. , 213 fish species were known from the basin. Since then several new species have been described from the basin such as five &quot;Hemibrycon&quot; in 2013, two &quot;Ancistrus&quot; in 2013 and a &quot;Farlowella&quot; in 2014. Among the more famous species in the basin are &quot;Kronoheros umbriferus&quot;, &quot;Ctenolucius hujeta&quot;, &quot;Geophagus steindachneri&quot;, &quot;Ichthyoelephas longirostris&quot;, &quot;Panaque cochliodon&quot;, &quot;Pimelodus blochii&quot;, &quot;Potamotrygon magdalenae&quot;, &quot;Prochilodus magdalenae&quot;, &quot;Pseudoplatystoma magdaleniatum&quot; and &quot;Salminus affinis&quot;. About 55% of the fish species in the basin are endemic, including four endemic genera: The catfish &quot;Centrochir&quot; and &quot;Eremophilus&quot;, and the characids &quot;Carlastyanax&quot; (often included in &quot;Astyanax&quot;) and &quot;Genycharax&quot;. In general, the fish fauna shows connections with surrounding basins, notably Atrato and Maracaibo, but to a lesser extent also Amazon–Orinoco.

The most productive fishing areas in Colombia are in the basin, but there has been a drastic decrease in the annual harvest with a fall of about 90% between 1975 and 2008. The primary threats are pollution (such as human waste, mining, farming and deforestation causing siltation) and habitat loss (such a dams). Additional dams are being constructed, including El Quimbo (opened in 2015) and Ituango (expected operational in 2018), which has caused some controversy. As a result of the pollution, heavy metals have also been detected in some commercially important fish in the river. , 19 fish species in the river basin were recognized as threatened.

=== Other animals ===

The Magdalena River and its valley crosses a wide variety of ecosystems, like páramo in its headwaters, dry forest in the upper part of its valley, rainforest in its middle course, and swamps and wetlands in its lower course. The spectacled caiman, green iguana and brown pelican are abundant in these ecosystems but other animal species like the West Indian manatee, Magdalena tinamou, Todd&#x27;s parakeet, American crocodile, Colombian slider, Magdalena River turtle, Dahl&#x27;s toad-headed turtle and red-footed tortoise are in danger of extinction.

In addition, there is a possible risk posed by invasive hippopotamus. Originally imported by Pablo Escobar, these hippopotamuses became feral following his demise, and have since expanded beyond their original home on Hacienda Napoles into nearby regions of the Magdalena River.

The Magdalena River Valley is home to a species of butterfly, Magdalena Valley ringlet or &quot;Splendeuptychia ackeryi&quot;, first identified in 2009. There are many endangered mammals and birds found in the region, including the brown spider monkey and the endemic blue-billed curassow and white-mantled barbet. These species are threatened by habitat loss, among other factors.

=== Flora ===
The first recorded European contact with the potato was in 1537 in the Magdalena Valley. The Spanish invaders became familiar with the crop and it was probably around 1570 when a Spanish ship first introduced potatoes to Europe.

== History ==

Due to its geographical position in the north of South America, the Magdalena River was since precolumbian times a route towards the interior of present-day Colombia and Ecuador. Several Carib-speaking peoples such as the Panche and the Yariguí ascended through the western bank of the river, while its eastern portion was inhabited by the Muisca civilization, which called the river &quot;Yuma&quot;.

Likewise, the Spanish conquistadores who arrived to today&#x27;s Colombia early in the 16th century used the river to push to the wild and mountainous inland after Rodrigo de Bastidas discovered and named the river on April 1, 1501. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the river was the only transport link communicating Bogotá with the Caribbean Sea port Cartagena de Indias and thus with Europe.

The Magdalena Campaign of Pierre Labatut and Simón Bolívar took place along the Magdalena River.

In 1825, the Congress of Colombia awarded a concession to establish steam navigation in the Magdalena River to Juan Bernardo Elbers, but his company closed shortly after. By 1845, steamboats regularly travelled on the river until 1961, when the last steamers ceased operation.

== In mass media ==
Much of the film &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; takes place in the historic, walled city of Cartagena in Colombia. Some screenshots showed the Magdalena River and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range.

&quot;The General in His Labyrinth&quot;, by Gabriel García Márquez, is a fictionalized account of the final voyage of Simón Bolívar down the Magdalena River, where he revisits many cities and villages along the river.

In &quot;Magdalena: River of Dreams&quot; (Knopf, 2020), Canadian writer, anthropologist, and explorer Wade Davis travels the length of the river by boat, on foot, by car, and on horseback combining descriptions of nature with episodes from Colombian history.
