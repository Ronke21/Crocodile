<text>Ragusa (; ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in southern Italy. It is the capital of the province of Ragusa, on the island of Sicily, with 73,288 inhabitants in 2016. It is built on a wide limestone hill between two deep valleys, Cava San Leonardo and Cava Santa Domenica. Together with seven other cities in the Val di Noto, it is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== History ==
The origins of Ragusa can be traced back to the 2nd millennium BC, when there were several Sicel settlements in the area. The current district of Ragusa Ibla has been identified as Hybla Heraea.

The ancient city, located on a hill, came into contact with nearby Greek colonies, and grew thanks to the nearby port of Camerina. After a short period of Carthaginian rule, it fell into the hands of the ancient Romans and the Byzantines, who fortified the city and built a large castle. Ragusa was occupied by the Arabs in 848 AD and remained under their rule until the 11th century, when the Normans conquered it. Ragusa was selected as a county seat, and its first count was Geoffrey, son of Count Ruggero of Sicily.

Thereafter, Ragusa&#x27;s history followed the events of the Kingdom of Sicily, created in the first half of the twelfth century. A Chiaramonte family fief, it remained the county capital after it has been unified with Modica in 1296, a status that it lost in the 15th century after a popular revolt.

In 1693, Ragusa was devastated by a huge earthquake, which killed some 5,000 inhabitants. After the catastrophe, the city was largely rebuilt, and many Baroque buildings from that time remain in the city. Most of the population moved to a new settlement in the former district of Patro. The new municipality was called &quot;Ragusa Superiore&quot; (Upper Ragusa) and the ancient city &quot;Ragusa Inferiore&quot; (Lower Ragusa). Both cities remained separated until 1926, when they were merged to become a provincial capital in 1927 at the expense of Modica, which had been the former capital and the most populous and important city in the region since 1296.

In 1838, an asphalt deposit was discovered, which is still being worked.

In 1848, together with the cities of Modica and Scicli, it rebelled against the Bourbon government to obtain the island&#x27;s freedom and independence. In 1860, armed volunteers were immediately sent to help Garibaldi, who had just landed in Marsala. It became part of the Kingdom of Italy under the guidance of Senator Corrado Arezzo de Spuches di Donnafugata. In 1889, the Banca Popolare Cooperativa di Ragusa was founded, the first embryo of the current Banca Agricola Popolare di Ragusa. The bank thrived thanks to the huge wealth and prosperous agriculture that belonged to the now ex-county, and it immediately became an important point of reference for the whole Ibla economy.

In the early 20th century, socialist ideas spread particularly strongly in the Ragusa area compared to rest of the region, according to many fascist historians. Ragusa was described as a &quot;fief of the reds&quot;, like that of Bologna. A strong political dialectic caused fascism to impose itself on Ragusa, which provoked a violent response similar to that in the Po Valley. On 29 January 1921, a group of fascists destroyed the socialist circle of Vittoria, killed a man and injured four others. Two months later in Ragusa, four people were killed and sixty were injured. The main promoter of fascist ideology in Ragusa was Totò Giurato, the grandfather of the television presenter Luca Giurato.

During the Second World War, Ragusa was one of many Sicilian towns in which the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini was deeply unpopular. The reasons were straightforward anti-Sicilian racism on the part of the fascist regime, which was central to the regime&#x27;s ideology, and the anti-mafia campaign led by the fascist agent Cesare Mori, which was so heavy-handed, brutal and draconian that it managed to alienate huge swaths of the Sicilian population. Also, the fascist administration in Sicily was largely incompetent and indifferent to the local population. When food became scarce and the regime had to start rationing food, Sicily was designated as being the last to receive food aid. That often included food that was grown in Sicily (particularly wheat and fruit), which was then exported to Northern Italy although scarcity had become a major problem in Sicily. Police officers from Sicily were replaced with those from Northern Italy since the former were perceived by the regime to be more loyal to their local communities than to Mussolini. Those from Northern Italy were underpaid, which led to them quickly becoming corrupt and indifferent. Also, they often held attitudes that were contemptuous towards the Sicilian population.

When the combined British and American military operation to invade Sicily began (Operation Husky), the population of Ragusa deeply resented Mussolini and his regime. British forces landed to south and east of Ragusa along the coast, and American forces landed southwest of Ragusa in the Gulf of Gela. Both groups linked up in several towns in both locations, including Ragusa. The small detachment of fascist troops in Ragusa fled without fighting while the British and American forces approached. The local population welcomed the British and American soldiers with &quot;unbridled enthusiasm&quot;.

On 6 May 1950, with a regular papal bull, Ragusa was raised to the dignity of diocese because of the wise and constant commitment of Msgr. Carmelo Canzonieri, the parish priest of Saint John the Baptist who later became auxiliary bishop of Messina before and then of Caltagirone. That took the territory from the archdiocese of Syracuse and the diocese of Noto.

Ragusa is now a dynamic and wealthy city and home to numerous companies. It is also the most important financial pole of the south because of the BAPR, which is the fourth Italian popular bank.

Since the 1990s, the economy of Ragusa has been developing towards the industrial sector, which is still growing rapidly, in contrast to the situation in Italy. The scarce presence of infrastructure has limited the great potential of this territory, but it remains the most important export area of Sicily.

== Geography ==
Ragusa is a hilltown that lies below the Hyblaean Mountains, and is historically divided into Ragusa Ibla and Ragusa Superiore. The municipality borders with Chiaramonte Gulfi, Comiso, Giarratana, Modica, Monterosso Almo, Rosolini (SR), Santa Croce Camerina, Scicli and Vittoria. It counts the hamlets (&quot;frazioni&quot;) of Marina di Ragusa, located by the sea, and San Giacomo Bellocozzo.

== Main sights ==

The city has two distinct areas, the lower and older town of Ragusa Ibla, and the higher Ragusa Superiore (Upper Town). The two halves are separated by the Valle dei Ponti, a deep ravine crossed by four bridges, the most noteworthy of which is the eighteenth-century &quot;Ponte dei Cappuccini&quot;.

=== Upper Town ===
Ragusa Cathedral, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist (&quot;San Giovanni Battista&quot;), is the biggest attraction in Ragusa Superiore. The church was originally located in the western part of ancient Ragusa, under the walls of the Mediaeval castle, where the small church of St. Agnese is today. A smaller building was quickly built on the site after the 1693 earthquake, which soon proved inadequate. The current edifice was built between 1718 and 1778, with a façade in typical southern Sicilian Baroque style, with three portals and sculptures representing the Madonna, St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist. The upper columns have two clocks showing the time in Italian and French fashions respectively. The high bell tower, on the left side, is also in Baroque style.

The ornate Baroque interior has a Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles separated by three colonnades embellished with gold. Charts showing Bible verses referring to St. John the Baptist are over every column. The dome was built in 1783, and covered with copper sheets during the 20th century. The side chapels, characterized by altars decorated with polychrome marbles, date from the 19th century.

Also noteworthy is the Hyblean Archaeological Museum, with different sections devoted to archaeological finds from the Prehistoric to the Late Roman era.

=== Ragusa Ibla ===

Ragusa Ibla is home to a wide array of Baroque architecture, including several stunning palaces and churches:
*&quot;Cathedral of San Giorgio&quot;: construction started in 1738 by architect Rosario Gagliardi, to replace temple destroyed by the 1693 earthquake. The church retains its older Catalan-Gothic style portal. The façade contains a flight of 250 steps and massive ornate columns, as well as statues of saints and decorated portals. The interior has a Latin Cross plan, with a nave and two aisles ending in half-circular apses. It is topped by a large Neoclassical dome built in 1820.
*&quot;Santa Maria delle Scale&quot; (&quot;Saint Mary of the Steps&quot;): church lies a narrow winding street connecting Ragusa Ibla with Ragusa Superiore. Built between the 15th and the 16th centuries. While badly damaged in the 1693 earthquake, half of this church was rebuilt in Baroque style, while half retained the original Gothic style (including the three Catalan-style portals in the right aisle). The last chapel of the latter has a Renaissance portal. The chapels altarpieces are by 18th-century Sicilian painters of the 18th century.
*&quot;Chiesa del Purgatorio&quot;: Dedicated to prayer for souls in purgatory, church has a baroque portal. 
*&quot;Santa Maria dell&#x27;Itria&quot;: built by the Knights of Malta in the 17th century, has a campanile with ceramics from Caltagirone and a canvas attributed to Mattia Preti.
*&quot;San Filippo Neri&quot;
*&quot;San Giorgio&quot;: designed by Rosario Gagliardi, church was built between 1739–1775, has a façade with tiers of juxtaposed columns. The Treasury contains silver items. Similar though smaller is the nearby church of San Giuseppe, with an elliptic interior housing a 17th-century statue.
*&quot;Sant&#x27;Antonino&quot;: church exemplifies Norman architecture, characterized by a Gothic portal, while the &quot;Church of Immacolata&quot; boasts a fine fourteenth-century portal.
* &quot;San Giorgio Vecchio&quot;: church boasts a façade with a notable Gothic-Catalan portal, with a high lunette portraying &quot;St George Killing the Dragon&quot;, and Aragonese eagles.
*&quot;Hyblean Garden&quot;: offers a good view to the three churches of the &quot;Cappuccini Vecchi&quot;, St. James (fourteenth century) and &quot;San Domenico&quot;.
*&quot;Zacco Palace&quot;: Baroque building, has Corinthian columns support balconies of wrought iron work, caryatids and grotesques.
*&quot;Villa Zinna&quot;: country estate.

==Government==
==Transport==
Ragusa has two railway stations, Ragusa and Ragusa Ibla, on the Canicattì-Gela-Syracuse line. Two other stations serve the localities of Donnafugata and Genisi.

The town will be served by the planned extension, from Rosolini to Gela, of the A18 motorway. The new exit of Ragusa will be located between the town and Marina di Ragusa.

<doc id="737281" wikidata="Q3646606" url="?curid=737281" title="Eddie Foy">
<text>Edwin Fitzgerald (March 9, 1856 – February 16, 1928), known professionally as Eddie Foy and Eddie Foy Sr., was an American actor, comedian, dancer and vaudevillian.

==Early years==

Foy&#x27;s parents, Richard and Mary Fitzgerald, emigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1855 and lived first in New York City&#x27;s Bowery neighborhood and then in Greenwich Village, where Eddie was born. After Richard died in an insane asylum in 1862 from syphilis-induced dementia, Mary took their four children (Eddie was second oldest) to Chicago, where at one time she reportedly tended the mentally ill widow of Abraham Lincoln.

Six-year-old Eddie began performing in the streets and local saloons to support his family. At 15 he began to use the stage name Foy, and with a partner began dancing in bars, traveling throughout the western United States. He worked for a time as a supernumerary in theatrical productions, sharing a stage at times with such leading men of the time as Edwin Booth and Joseph Jefferson. With another partner, Jim Thompson, Foy went west again and gained his first professional recognition in mining camps and cow towns. In one such town, Dodge City, Kansas, Foy and his partner lingered for some time and Foy became acquainted with notable citizens Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, and Doc Holliday. In later years, Foy told of an altercation over a girl with fellow actor Charles Chaplin (not the later film star), who was drunkenly taking pot-shots at Foy. The gunfire awakened Wyatt Earp, who disarmed the actor and sent both the players home to sleep it off. Foy is also rumored to have been in Tombstone, Arizona, in October 1881, appearing at the Birdcage Theater when the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral occurred on the 26th of that month.

In 1879, Foy married Rose Howland, one of the singing Howland Sisters, who were traveling the same circuit. Three years later, Foy and troupe relocated to Philadelphia and joined the Carncross Minstrels. That same year Rose died in childbirth, as did the child she was delivering. Foy lingered with the troupe for two seasons and then returned to the road. He joined David Henderson&#x27;s troupe and traveled all around the U.S., dancing, doing comedy, and acting in farces. In San Francisco, still in 1882, he met Lola Sefton and was romantically involved with her for ten years until her death in 1894; the two never married, but had a daughter named Catherine who was raised by Foy&#x27;s sister, Mary.

==Return to Chicago==
Foy returned to Chicago in 1888 as the star comedian in variety shows and revues, initially for his own company. In 1889 he had a tremendous success as the star of the musical &quot;Blue Beard, Jr.&quot; when it premiered at the Grand Opera House, Chicago He then toured with that production nationally; including stops at Boston&#x27;s Tremont Theatre (1889) and Broadway&#x27;s Niblo&#x27;s Garden (1890). He also played the variety circuits for years in a series of song and dance acts.

In 1896, Foy married his third wife, Madeline Morando, a dancer with his company. She gave him eleven children, of whom seven survived childhood: Bryan (1896–1977); Charley (1898–1984); Mary (1901–1987); Madeline (1903–1988); Eddie Jr. (1905–1983); Richard (1905–1947); and Irving (1908–2003). Eddie Jr.&#x27;s son, Eddie III, was a casting director with Columbia Pictures for over 40 years.

Between 1901 and 1912, Foy played the leading comic roles in a series of musical comedies in New York City and on tour, including &quot;The Strollers&quot; (1901), &quot;The Wild Rose&quot; (1902), &quot;Mr. Bluebeard&quot; (1903), &quot;Piff! Paff!! Pouf!!!&quot; (1904), &quot;The Earl and the Girl&quot; (1905), &quot;The Orchid&quot; (1907), &quot;Mr Hamlet of Broadway&quot; (1908/9), &quot;Up and Down Broadway&quot; (1910), and &quot;Over the River&quot; (1912). It was while on tour with &quot;Mr. Bluebeard&quot; that he became a hero of Chicago&#x27;s infamous Iroquois Theatre fire, December 30, 1903. A malfunctioning spotlight set fire to the scenery backstage, and Foy stayed onstage until the last minute, trying to keep the audience from panicking. Survivors later praised Foy for his bravery in trying to keep the crowd calm, even as burning debris fell onto the stage all around him. The theater&#x27;s safety features were inadequate, the theater personnel untrained, and some of the exits locked from the outside, and at least 600 people died. Foy escaped by crawling through a sewer.

==Eddie Foy and The Seven Little Foys==

Between 1910 and 1913, he formed a family vaudeville act, &quot;Eddie Foy and The Seven Little Foys&quot;, which quickly became a national sensation. While Foy was a stern disciplinarian backstage, he portrayed an indulgent father onstage, and the Foys toured successfully for over a decade, appearing in one motion picture. His wife Madeline died in 1918. The children began to go their separate ways after Foy married Marie Reilly Coombs in 1923, but four of the younger children (Charley, Mary, Madeline and Irving) performed together until the mid 1930s. Foy continued to appear in vaudeville and starred in the hit Broadway comedy &quot;The Fallen Star&quot; in 1927. He died of a heart attack while headlining on the Orpheum circuit in Kansas City, Missouri, at age 71.

The seven children reunited for a 1928 Vitaphone short #2580, &quot;Chips of the Old Block&quot;. Six of the seven appeared onscreen, doing a portion of their song-and-dance act, and Bryan directed. The film opens with the girls singing and dancing to &quot;I&#x27;ll Just Roll Along (Havin&#x27; My Ups and Downs)&quot; while Bryan plays ukulele. Charley, Eddie Jr., and Irving then perform a comedy routine. Next, Eddie Jr. does an eccentric dance routine, there&#x27;s a short song interlude, and the film ends with soft shoe routine in which each has a solo bit.
After the &quot;Seven Little Foys&quot; stopped performing together, they pursued separate careers. Eddie Foy Jr. had a successful acting career on stage and screen. Bryan composed show music, wrote for Buster Keaton, and directed and produced films in Hollywood. Richard continued to operate a theater chain business in Dallas that he had started with Foy. Irving wrote and managed cinemas in Dallas and Albuquerque. Charley and Mary operated the Charley Foy Supper Club in Sherman Oaks, California, in the San Fernando Valley, where comedians such as Jackie Gleason, Dan Rowan, Dick Martin, and Phil Silvers appeared early in their careers.

The family&#x27;s story was filmed in 1955 as &quot;The Seven Little Foys&quot; with Bob Hope as Foy and James Cagney as George M. Cohan; Charley Foy narrated. Eddie Foy Jr. appeared as his father in four films – &quot;Frontier Marshal&quot; (1939), &quot;Lillian Russell&quot; (1940), &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), and &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944) – as well as in a television version of &quot;The Seven Little Foys&quot; with Mickey Rooney as George M. Cohan (1964). The first stage musical version of &quot;The Seven Little Foys,&quot; written by Chip Deffaa, premiered at the Seven Angels Theater in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2007. In 2008, it was revived in New York at the New York International Fringe Festival; the cast included Ryan Foy, Foy&#x27;s great grandson and grandson of Irving Foy.

==Death==
On February 16th, 1928, at age 71, Foy died of a heart attack at the Hotel Baltimore in Kansas City, Missouri. All of Foy&#x27;s children except Bryan are buried with their father and mother, Madeline, at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in New Rochelle, New York.

<text>The Chief Joseph Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the Columbia River, upriver from Bridgeport, Washington. The dam is upriver from the mouth of the Columbia at Astoria, Oregon. It is operated by the USACE Chief Joseph Dam Project Office and the electricity is marketed by the Bonneville Power Administration.

==History==
The dam was authorized as Foster Creek Dam and Powerhouse for power generation and irrigation by the &quot;River and Harbor Act of 1946&quot;. The &quot;River and Harbor Act of 1948&quot; renamed the project Chief Joseph Dam in honor of the Nez Perce chief who spent his last years in exile on the Colville Indian Reservation. Because of its lack of fish ladders, Chief Joseph Dam completely blocks salmon migration to the upper Columbia River system.

Construction began in 1950, with the main dam and intake structure completed in 1955. Installation of the initial generating units was started in 1958 and completed in 1961. Ten additional turbines were installed between 1973 and 1979, and the dam and lake were raised , boosting the capacity to , making Chief Joseph Dam the second largest hydroelectric power producer in the United States.

== Type ==
Chief Joseph Dam is a run-of-the-river dam which means the lake behind the dam is not able to store large amounts of water. Water flowing to Chief Joseph Dam from Grand Coulee Dam must be passed on to Wells Dam at approximately the same rate. With 27 main generators in the powerhouse, it has the hydraulic capacity of .

In the event more water flows to Chief Joseph Dam than could be used for power generation, the spillway gates would be opened to pass the excess water. With an average annual flow rate of , the Columbia River seldom exceeds the powerplant&#x27;s capability to pass water, and spilling of water is infrequent at Chief Joseph Dam.

== Reservoir ==
The reservoir behind the dam is named Rufus Woods Lake, and runs up the river channel. Bridgeport State Park, on the lake, is adjacent to the dam.

<doc id="737289" wikidata="Q1761614" url="?curid=737289" title="Mica Dam">
<text>Mica Dam is a hydroelectric embankment dam spanning the Columbia River 135 kilometres north of Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada. It was built as one of three Canadian projects under the terms of the 1964 Columbia River Treaty and is operated by BC Hydro. Completed in 1973, the Mica powerhouse had an original generating capacity of 1,805 megawatts (MW). Mica Dam, named after the nearby settlement of Mica Creek and its associated stream, in turn named after the abundance of mica minerals in the area, is one of the largest earthfill dams in the world. The reservoir created by the dam is Kinbasket Lake. Water from the dam flows south directly into Revelstoke Lake, the reservoir for the Revelstoke Dam. Mica Dam is the tallest dam in Canada and second tallest in North America after the Chicoasén Dam in Mexico and it is the farthest upstream dam on the Columbia River. The dam&#x27;s underground powerhouse was the second largest in the world at the time of its construction, and was the first 500 kV installation of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) insulated switchgear in the world.

== History ==
Mica Dam was constructed by BC Hydro as part of three projects, along with Duncan Dam and Arrow Dam, required under the Columbia River Treaty, ratified in 1964. Construction began in 1967, and was completed on March 23, 1973.

Mica Dam was operational on March 29, 1973. The dam was built to a height of above bedrock, near the first location of the village Mica Creek. The dam operated with a reservoir containing of live storage and of total storage in McNaughton Lake, later renamed Kinbasket Lake in 1980.
The underground powerhouse, begun in 1973, was built to be high, wide and long. In 1976, the first two electrical generators were commissioned, and in 1977 two more were completed bringing the total capacity of the powerhouse to 1,805 MW. Another two 500 MW generators were added and became operational in 2014 and in 2015, giving a total generating capacity of 2,805 MW.

The Mica powerhouse delivers its power to Nicola Substation via a 500-kilovolt, transmission line. A second power transmission line was built to the Meridian Substation near Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada.

The creation of Kinbasket Lake submerged parts of the Big Bend Country, a subregion of the Columbia Country. This included a number of small communities along the Big Bend Highway, and the eastern section of that route. Also, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) line ran along the Columbia Valley from Donald to Beavermouth. Consequently, west of Donald, CP diverted the line to a higher elevation, which required constructing four new bridges and a tunnel.

Mica Dam was built to provide of water storage as outlined in the Columbia River Treaty, plus another , referred to as &quot;non-Treaty storage&quot;. Since 1977, BC Hydro and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) have made a series of long and short term agreements for using non-Treaty storage. Negotiations for a new long-term agreement began in 2011. If implemented, it would manage non-Treaty storage until 2024.

== Climate ==
Climate station located just south of Mica Dam at an elevation of .

== Pumped storage ==
Kinbasket Lake above Mica Dam normally has unused capacity to store water and Revelstoke Lake below the dam has minimal storage capacity. A proposed pumped storage addition on the side of Mica Dam would pump water into Kinbasket Lake, which would later be used to generate power at Mica and Revelstoke dams. This project was discussed in 2017 as storage for intermittent power from wind turbines in the event that the Site C Dam was cancelled.

<text>Revelstoke Dam, also known as Revelstoke Canyon Dam, is a hydroelectric dam (combined earthfill dam and gravity dam) spanning the Columbia River, north of Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada. The powerhouse was completed in 1984 and has an installed capacity of 2480 MW. Four generating units were installed initially, with one additional unit (#5) having come online in 2011. The reservoir behind the dam is named Lake Revelstoke. The dam is operated by BC Hydro.

== History ==
Construction of Revelstoke Dam started in 1978, and was completed in 1983.

Areas inundated by the dam include the Dalles des Morts or &quot;Death Rapids&quot;, which was the stretch of canyon just above the dam&#x27;s location, and various small localities along the pre-inundation route of the Big Bend Highway, which was the original route of the Trans-Canada Highway until the building of its Rogers Pass section. Just below the dam was the location of La Porte, one of the boomtowns of the Big Bend Gold Rush and the head of river navigation via the Arrow Lakes and Columbia River from Marcus, Washington.

== Revelstoke Dam Visitor Centre ==
The Revelstoke Dam Visitor Centre is located north of Revelstoke and is open seasonally. The centre features interactive exhibits, activities about the dam and hydroelectricity and a First Nations gallery opened in 2009, with exhibits about the art, history and culture of the Secwepemc (Shuswap), Okanagan and Ktunaxa peoples. Sinixt are not included in the exhibit, but also consider the Revelstoke Dam to fall within their territory. There is also a theatre, gift shop, and outdoor walkway across the top of the Powerhouse.

== Expansion ==

BC Hydro completed an expansion to add a fifth unit. The unit went online in 2011 and added 500 MW capacity, bringing the total generating capacity of the dam to around 2480 MW. In 2009, the plant generated 6,361 GWh of electricity. By 2018, after the expansion, then plant generated 7,817 GWh of electricity. The dam was built to accommodate a sixth unit, also sized around 500 MW; a contingency plan to build the sixth unit is possible but not scheduled as of December 2018.

<text>The 1923 Municipal Manager Law was the last type of reformed municipal government the state of New Jersey introduced in the Progressive Era. The law introduced to New Jersey the council–manager form of government first developed in Sumter, South Carolina.

The council is nonpartisan and elected at-large for four-year terms. The terms may be either concurrent or staggered, and there is an option for run-off elections. Presently, only Lodi Borough uses run-offs and staggered terms, with half of the council being elected for four-year terms every two years.

The mayor, elected by the council from its own numbers, has no executive responsibility beyond appointing representatives of commissions and boards, and presiding over council meetings. The mayor is elected for a four-year term in municipalities with concurrent terms or serves for a two-year term in Lodi Borough which has staggered terms.

The members of the council are subject to recall elections.

<text>Osvaldo Vieira International Airport , also known as Bissau-Bissalanca Airport, is an international airport that serves the city of Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, as well as the Metropolitan Region of Bissau. It is the only international airport in the country.

It is located in the Bissalanca district, in the city-sector of Safim, which is conurbated to Bissau.

==Name==
The name &quot;Osvaldo Vieira&quot; was given in honor of one of the most prominent nationalist commanders of the PAIGC and FARP during the country&#x27;s war of independence.

==History==
Before 1955, the city of Bissau depended mainly on the (now abandoned) Bolama airport, which was close to the town of Bolama, the colonial capital of Guinea until 1941. Travellers landing there still needed to take ferries to get to Bissau.

The airport was opened in May 1955 receiving the name &quot;Francisco Craveiro Lopes Airport&quot;, precisely during the visit of this Portuguese president. Despite its official name, it was generally called &quot;Bissalanca Airport&quot;.

Between 1961 and 1965, already during the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence, it was transformed into Base Aerodrome No. 2 (AB2), and; between 1965 and 1974 at Air Base No. 12 (BA12), of the Portuguese Air Force.

The airport had to be closed on June 7, 1998 due to intense fighting in and around Bissau. It was officially reopened in July 1999 when a TAP Portugal plane carrying Prime Minister Francisco Fadul, along with numerous other dignitaries from both Portugal and Guinea-Bissau, landed at Osvaldo Vieira.

On December 10, 2013, TAP Portugal suspended operations to Osvaldo Vieira International Airport after local police forces threatened the crew of Flight TP202 bound for Lisbon and forced the crew to board 74 Syrian refugees who had arrived in Bissau via Morocco and Turkey, and who were holding forged Turkish passports. After TAP Portugal suspended flights to Bissau in late 2013, the airport remained without flights to Lisbon until late October 2014, when euroAtlantic Airways announced a weekly flight between Bissau and Lisbon. However, TAP announced in August 2016 it would resume flights to Bissau by the end of the year.

==Facilities==
Osvaldo Vieira International Airport has one runway, heading 03/21, with a length of . The altitude of this runway is . This runway is also one of the three in Guinea-Bissau that are paved.

<text>The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, first published as &quot;The Journal of My Other Self&quot;, is a 1910 novel by Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke. The novel was the only work of prose of considerable length that he wrote and published. It is semiautobiographical and is written in an expressionistic style, with existentialist themes. It was conceptualized and written whilst Rilke lived in Paris, mainly inspired by Sigbjørn Obstfelder&#x27;s &quot;A Priest&#x27;s Diary&quot; and Jens Peter Jacobsen&#x27;s &quot;Niels Lyhne&quot;.

<text>McNary Dam is a 1.4-mile (2.2-km) long concrete gravity run-of-the-river dam which spans the Columbia River. It joins Umatilla County, Oregon with Benton County, Washington, 292 miles (470 km) upriver from the mouth of the Columbia. It is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; McNary Lock and Dam office. The dam is located a mile (2 km) east of the town of Umatilla, Oregon, and 8 miles (13 km) north of Hermiston, Oregon. The dam was originally planned to be named Umatilla Dam, but the Flood Control Act of 1945 renamed the dam in honor of Senator Charles L. McNary of Oregon, who had died in February 1944.

The dam provides for slackwater navigation, hydroelectric power generation, recreation, wildlife habitat, and incidental irrigation.
Bills for the construction of a dam were introduced in the United States Congress as early as 1931. The United States House of Representatives rivers and harbors committee initially approved the project in April 1941; navigation, power generation, and national security were the major reasons cited for construction of the dam. Construction began in 1947, and was completed in 1954. Activation of all generating units was completed in 1957. Its capacity is 980 MW. There are two fish ladders for salmon and steelhead passage, one on each shore of the dam. The Washington side also has an 86-foot (26 m) wide, 683 foot (208 m) long navigation lock that lifts boats an average of 75 feet (23 m). The dam flooded the Umatilla Rapids, forming a reservoir called Lake Wallula. The lake extends 64 miles (103 km) up the Columbia to the US DOE Hanford Site. It also extends up the Snake River to Ice Harbor Dam.

As with some other dams, it has two additional turbines whose purpose is to power the dam itself. That is, this dam is entirely self-sustaining. In the event of a large-scale grid outage, McNary would provide the black start capability necessary to restart other generation facilities. These two &quot;station service&quot; turbines are only capable of providing about three MW, compared to the 70 MW each of the other 14 turbines produce. These two turbines alternate service duty to provide the dam with its energy requirements.

The dam is equipped with three large &quot;fishway&quot; pumps which provide water to supplement the mostly gravity-fed fish ladders. These units are constructed like smaller versions of the main turbines which run &quot;in reverse.&quot;

McNary Dam is part of the Columbia River Basin system of dams and is one of fourteen hydropower facilities belonging to the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS).

<text>John Keate (30 March 1773 – 5 March 1852) was an English schoolmaster, and Head Master of Eton College.

He was born at Wells, Somerset, the son of Prebendary William Keate, rector of Laverton, Somerset, and brother of Robert Keate (1777–1857), Serjeant-Surgeon to King William IV and Queen Victoria.

He was educated at Eton, and was admitted to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1792, winning the Browne Medal in 1793, 1794 and 1795, and the Craven scholarship in 1794, graduating B.A. 1796, M.A. 1799, D.D. (&quot;per literas regias&quot;) 1810.

Taking holy orders, he became, about 1797, an assistant master at Eton College. In 1809 he was elected headmaster, having been &quot;Under Master&quot;. Although his predecessor had been somewhat relaxed, and the teacher-pupil ratio was extremely low, the discipline of the school was not improved by the harsh measures that he took as headmaster, including large-scale floggings with the birch, resulting in mass rebellions by the boys. Following an attempted rebellion, Keate flogged more than 80 boys on a single day, 30 June 1832, an event known as the &quot;great flogging&quot;. He retired in 1834.

Keate was made a canon of the eighth stall of Windsor in 1820. He died at Hartley Wespall, Hampshire, of which parish he had been rector since 1824.

<text>Laura Alice Wright (née Sisk; born September 11, 1970) is an American actress. She is best known for playing the roles of Allison &quot;Ally&quot; Rescott on &quot;Loving&quot; (1991 to 1995) and &quot;The City&quot; (1995 to 1997), Cassie Layne Winslow on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (1997 to 2005) and Carly Corinthos (Spencer) on &quot;General Hospital&quot; (2005 to present). She won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 2011. She has since received six more nominations in the same category.

==Early life==
Wright was born Laura Alice Sisk in Washington, D.C. and raised in Clinton, Maryland. She appeared in several high school plays such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Our Town&quot;, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;. She also directed a school production of &quot;Father Says No&quot;. She appeared in a few local commercials and numerous fashion shows. After high school, Wright attended one semester of college before leaving and taking a full time job at a gas station owned by her father in Clinton.

==Career==
While working at her father&#x27;s gas station, Wright took an acting class. The teacher submitted a videotape of her students to the ABC soap opera &quot;Loving&quot;. Wright almost missed the taping because she overslept that day. The show responded, and Wright (then using her maiden name of Sisk), flew to New York City for a screen test. She was cast as Allison &quot;Ally&quot; Rescott, playing the role from 1991 until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1995. She then played the same role on &quot;The City&quot;, a spin off of &quot;Loving&quot;, from 1995 to 1997.

After the cancellation of &quot;The City&quot;, Wright joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Cassie Layne Winslow in August 1997. She won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Favorite New Character for her role on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in 1998. Wright decided to leave the show when her contract expired in October 2005. She said her exit wasn&#x27;t related to budget cuts or backstage drama, she simply wanted to try other opportunities. Her final airdate was November 3, 2005. The role was recast.

On September 12, 2005, it was announced that Wright would begin playing Carly Corinthos on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She was the fourth actress to play the role, succeeding Jennifer Bransford. ABC Daytime executive Brian Frons said in a statement, &quot;Carly is a complex character, and we are excited to bring Laura&#x27;s talent, beauty and intelligence to this role.&quot; Wright&#x27;s first airdate was November 4, 2005, the day after her final episode of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; aired.

In 2011, after 20 years on daytime soap operas, Wright received her first Daytime Emmy Award nomination. She was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress for her role on &quot;General Hospital&quot; and won the award. Wright was nominated again in the same category in 2012. She also received nominations in 2015, 2017 to 2019, and 2022.

In 2013, Wright guest starred on an episode of the VH1 series &quot;Hit the Floor&quot;. In 2015, she made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Joy&quot;, alongside &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-stars Maurice Benard and Donna Mills. She starred as Dr. Lori Hanson in the Lifetime film &quot;Deadly Patient&quot; (also titled &quot;Stalked by My Patient&quot;) in 2018.

== Personal life ==
Wright announced her engagement to architect John Wright in August 1995. They had dated on and off throughout high school and college before reuniting a few years later. John proposed to her in the back of a New York taxi at 10 o&#x27;clock at night. The wedding was originally scheduled for June 1, 1996. They were married on October 7, 1995. They have a daughter, who was born in 1998, and a son, who was born in 2000. In April 2016, Wright announced that she and John had decided to end their marriage.

Wright has been in a relationship with her &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Wes Ramsey since 2017. They first met several years earlier, when they worked together on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

<text>Hugh Hale Franklin (August 24, 1916 – September 26, 1986) was an American stage and television actor. He was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma.

Franklin was best known for his role as Dr. Charles Tyler on &quot;All My Children&quot;, a role he played from the show&#x27;s first episode in 1970 until 1983. He was forced to retire as his hearing loss, which had previously been gradual, started to affect his ability to receive cues.

He also had roles on the soap operas &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, and &quot;Love of Life&quot;.

Prior to &quot;All My Children&quot;, Franklin appeared in such Broadway productions as &quot;The Joyous Season&quot;, &quot;I Know My Love&quot;, and &quot;Medea&quot;. Other theatre credits include &quot;Harriet&quot;, &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, &quot;One Man Show&quot;, and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

He was married for 40 years to Newbery Medal-winning author Madeleine L&#x27;Engle. She wrote a book about their marriage, called &quot;Two-Part Invention: The Story of a Marriage&quot; (1988), and frequently mentioned him in her other non-fiction titles.

Franklin died of cancer on September 26, 1986 in Connecticut. He and L&#x27;Engle had three children: Josephine, Maria, and Bion Franklin.

<text>Peter Michael Bergman (born June 11, 1953) is an American television actor best known for his portrayals on soap operas: as Cliff Warner on &quot;All My Children&quot; (1979–89) on ABC and as Jack Abbott on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (1989–present) on CBS.

==Biography==
The son of Walter Bergman, a United States Navy officer, he was born in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He later graduated from Crossland High School in Camp Springs, Maryland. Bergman was married to actress and singer Christine Ebersole from 1976 to 1981. In 1985, he married Mariellen, with whom he has two children.

==Career==
Bergman originally auditioned for the &quot;All My Children&quot; role of Dr. Jeff Martin. His first notable role was his portrayal of Dr. Cliff Warner on &quot;All My Children&quot;, which he played from 1979 to 1987 and again from 1988-89. His character, Cliff, married Nina (Taylor Miller) four times (1980, 1982, 1986, and 1989) and divorced her three times. 

In a Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup advertising campaign in 1986, Bergman told the viewing audience, &quot;I’m not a doctor, but I play one on TV.&quot; Chris Robinson, who played Dr. Rick Webber on ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot;, was the original spokesperson in the ad campaign, which started in 1984. Bergman replaced Robinson after the latter experienced some legal difficulties. 

Since 1989, Bergman has played the role of Jack Abbott on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. In 1997, Bergman portrayed Jack Abbott in the episode &quot;The Heather Biblow Story&quot; on &quot;The Nanny&quot;, where he shared an on-screen kiss with Pamela Anderson. In 2001, he guest starred as Jack on &quot;The King of Queens&quot; in an episode of Season 3.

<text>Oxalis ( (American English) or (British English)) is a large genus of flowering plants in the wood-sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, comprising over 550 species. The genus occurs throughout most of the world, except for the polar areas; species diversity is particularly rich in tropical Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.

Many of the species are known as wood sorrels (sometimes written &quot;woodsorrels&quot; or &quot;wood-sorrels&quot;) as they have an acidic taste reminiscent of the sorrel proper (&quot;Rumex acetosa&quot;), which is not closely related. Some species are called yellow sorrels or pink sorrels after the color of their flowers instead. Other species are colloquially known as false [[shamrock]]s, and some called [[sourgrass]]es. For the genus as a whole, the term oxalises is also used.

==Description==

The plants are annual or perennial. The leaves are divided into three to ten or more obovate and top-notched leaflets, arranged palmately with all the leaflets of roughly equal size. The majority of species have three leaflets, superficially similar to those of some clovers. Some species exhibit rapid changes in leaf angle in response to temporarily high light intensity to decrease photoinhibition.

The flowers have five petals, which are usually fused at the base, and ten stamens. The petal color varies from white to pink, red or yellow; anthocyanins and xanthophylls may be present or absent but are generally not both present together in significant quantities, meaning that few wood-sorrels have bright orange flowers. The fruit is a small capsule containing several seeds. The roots are often tuberous and succulent, and several species also reproduce vegetatively by production of bulbils, which detach to produce new plants.

== Ecology ==
Several &quot;Oxalis&quot; species dominate the plant life in local woodland ecosystems, be it Coast Range ecoregion of the North American Pacific Northwest, or the Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest in southeastern Australia where least yellow sorrel (&quot;O. exilis&quot;) is common. In the United Kingdom and neighboring Europe, common wood sorrel (&quot;O. acetosella&quot;) is the typical woodland member of this genus, forming large swaths in the typical mixed deciduous forests dominated by downy birch (&quot;Betula pubescens&quot;) and sessile oak (&quot;Quercus petraea&quot;), by sycamore maple (&quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;), common bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;), pedunculate oak (&quot;Q. robur&quot;) and blackberries (&quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot; agg.), or by common ash (&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;), dog&#x27;s mercury (&quot;Mercurialis perennis&quot;) and European rowan (&quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot;); it is also common in woods of common juniper (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot; ssp. &quot;communis&quot;). Some species – notably Bermuda-buttercup (&quot;O. pes-caprae&quot;) and creeping woodsorrel (&quot;O. corniculata&quot;) – are pernicious, invasive weeds when escaping from cultivation outside their native ranges; the ability of most wood-sorrels to store reserve energy in their tubers makes them quite resistant to most weed control techniques.

A 2019 study suggested that species from this genus have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing &quot;Bacillus&quot; endophytes, storing them in plant tissues and seeds, which could explain its ability to spread rapidly even in poor soils.

Tuberous woodsorrels provide food for certain small herbivores – such as the Montezuma quail (&quot;Cyrtonyx montezumae&quot;). The foliage is eaten by some Lepidoptera, such as the Polyommatini pale grass blue (&quot;Pseudozizeeria maha&quot;) – which feeds on creeping wood sorrel and others – and dark grass blue (&quot;Zizeeria lysimon&quot;).

&quot;Oxalis&quot; species are susceptible to rust (&quot;Puccinia oxalidis&quot;).


==Uses==

===As food===
Wood sorrel (a type of oxalis) is an edible wild plant that has been consumed by humans around the world for millennia. In Dr. James Duke&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Edible Weeds,&quot; he notes that the Native American Kiowa people chewed wood sorrel to alleviate thirst on long trips, the Potawatomi cooked it with sugar to make a dessert, the Algonquin considered it an aphrodisiac, the Cherokee ate wood sorrel to alleviate mouth sores and a sore throat, and the Iroquois ate wood sorrel to help with cramps, fever and nausea.

The fleshy, juicy edible tubers of the oca (&quot;O. tuberosa&quot;) have long been cultivated for food in Colombia and elsewhere in the northern Andes mountains of South America. It is grown and sold in New Zealand as &quot;New Zealand yam&quot; (although not a true yam), and varieties are now available in yellow, orange, apricot, and pink, as well as the traditional red-orange.

The leaves of scurvy-grass sorrel (&quot;O. enneaphylla&quot;) were eaten by sailors travelling around Patagonia as a source of vitamin C to avoid scurvy.

In India, creeping wood sorrel (&quot;O. corniculata&quot;) is eaten only seasonally, starting in December–January. The Bodos of north east India sometimes prepare a sour fish curry with its leaves. The leaves of common wood sorrel (&quot;O. acetosella&quot;) may be used to make a lemony-tasting tea when dried.

===Other uses===
In the past, it was a practice to extract crystals of calcium oxalate for use in treating diseases and as a salt called &quot;sal acetosella&quot; or &quot;sorrel salt&quot; (also known as &quot;salt of lemon&quot;). Growing oca tuber root caps are covered in a fluorescent slush rich in harmaline and harmine which apparently suppresses pests. Creeping wood sorrel and perhaps other species are apparently hyperaccumulators of copper. The Ming Dynasty text &quot;Precious Secrets of the Realm of the King of Xin&quot; from 1421 describes how &quot;O. corniculata&quot; can be used to locate copper deposits as well as for geobotanical prospecting. It thus ought to have some potential for phytoremediation of contaminated soils.
==As ornamental plants==

Several species are grown as pot plants or as ornamental plants in gardens, for example, &quot;O. versicolor&quot;.

Oxalis flowers range in colour from whites to yellow, peaches, pink, or multi-coloured flowers.

Some varieties have double flowers, for example the double form of &quot;O. compressus&quot;. Some varieties are grown for their foliage, such as the dark purple-leaved &quot;O. triangularis&quot;.

Species with four regular leaflets – in particular &quot;O. tetraphylla&quot; (four-leaved pink-sorrel) – are sometimes misleadingly sold as &quot;four-leaf clover&quot;, taking advantage of the mystical status of four-leaf clover.

<text>Gweru, originally known as Gwelo, is a city in central Zimbabwe. It is on the centre of Midlands Province. Originally an area known to the Ndebele as &quot;The Steep Place&quot; because of the Gweru River&#x27;s high banks, in 1894 it became the site of a military outpost established by Leander Starr Jameson. In 1914 it attained municipal status, and in 1971 it became a city.

The city has a population of 158,200 as of the 2022 census. Gweru is known for farming activities in beef cattle, crop farming, and commercial gardening of crops for the export market. It is also home to a number of colleges and universities, most prominently Midlands State University and Mkoba Teachers College.

The city was nicknamed City of Progress.

== History ==
Gweru used to be named Gwelo. Matabele settlement was named iKwelo (&quot;The Steep Place&quot;), after the river&#x27;s high banks. The modern town, founded in 1894 as a military outpost, developed as an agricultural centre and became a municipality in 1914.

== Geography ==
The geographical coordinates for Gweru Urban are 19° 27&#x27; 0&quot; South and 29° 49&#x27; 0&quot; East. This places Gweru at the centre of Zimbabwe. The area coverage is almost 46 166 km2. The city is built alongside Bulawayo-Harare railway and the road near the railway spur to Mabuto.

=== Climate ===
== Demographics ==
==Nature and wildlife==
In and around Gweru there are attractive places, some are man-made and some are natural. There is:

* Antelope Park
* White Waters
* Insukamini Ruins
== Economy ==
Situated along the road and railway between Harare and Bulawayo and near the rail spur to Maputo, Mozambique, Gweru has become a busy trade centre with modest industrial development. Its products include ferrochromium, textiles, dairy foods, leather, and building materials. The surrounding area, with its rich deposits of gold, chrome, iron, asbestos, and limestone, supports a number of mines. The training section of Zimbabwe&#x27;s air force is in Gweru at the Gweru-Thornhill Air Base.

The city is also known for vibrant farming activities in cattle ranching, and farming including, commercial gardening of crops for the export market. The country&#x27;s oldest shoe manufacturer, the Bata Shoe Company and the Military and Aviation Museums are also some key features for which Gweru is well known.

== Culture ==
The Boggie clock tower, located at the intersection of Main Street and Robert Mugabe Way, was built in 1928 in memory of Major William James Boggie. The clock tower is one of the city&#x27;s most famous landmarks.

The Nalatale and Danamombe archaeological sites lie approximately 70 and 85 km to the southwest, the known for their patterned stonework. The remains at these sites date back to as early as the Torwa state during the 17th century, the most substantial being a four hundred-year-old stone wall decorated with motifs known to the tradition of stone-building in Zimbabwe. The surrounding area has rich deposits of gold, chrome, iron, asbestos and platinum and supports several mines.

=== Tourism ===
The main hotel in the city is the Midlands Hotel, which was opened in 1927 by the Meikles brothers. This hotel was to be demolished but after many protests by the population it was saved. Another important hotel is the Chitukuko (formerly the Hotel Cecil), located in the downtown area of the city. Both hotels were owned by Patrick Kombayi, a former mayor. The Fairmile Motel is just one mile from the city center on the Bulawayo highway .

== Media ==
Gweru&#x27;s local newspaper, &quot;The Gweru Times&quot;, once ceased publishing in 2015 but now operational.

== Industry ==
 Gweru was famous for housing big companies that are no longer operating, and which left thousands of employees jobless. There is hope that future big SME companies will make up for the loss in economic activity created by this situation. These big companies were previously housed in and around Gweru. Below is the list of these companies grouped according to size and type of the industry. The companies that previously flourished in Gweru were Bata Shoe Company, ZimGlass, ZimCast, ZimAlloys, Delta Corporation, Anchor Yeast. Today most of their previous premises are derelict and are a painful reminder of a vibrant industrial city that Gweru once was.

 However,Midlands State University is a recent feature of Gweru which has pushed the city to seek positive recognition as an education centre.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
Railways arrived in Gwelo (Gweru) in 1902. National Railways of Zimbabwe have the country&#x27;s largest marshalling yard, Dabuka, on the south side of Gweru. Dabuka plays a pivotal role in rail movement in the country as it is the central hub of the rail links to Mozambique in the east, South Africa in the south and Botswana and Namibia in the south west, lying on the Beira–Bulawayo railway.

Gwelo was once home to the Gwelo &amp; District Light Railway, a 2 ft gauge steam for pleasure railway.

===Roads===
As a central city (hub), it has direct links to all the other cities and towns of Zimbabwe. It is 164 km from Bulawayo, 183 km from Masvingo, 471 km from Beitbridge, and 275 km from Harare.

Road names used are by destination only, for example the Harare-Bulawayo Road. There are only mainroads, no highways or freeways.

<text>Mary Anne Keeley, &quot;née&quot; Goward (22 November 1805 – 12 March 1899) was an English actress and actor-manager.

==Life==
Mary Ann Goward was born at Ipswich, her father was a brazier and tinman. Her sister Sarah Judith Goward was the mother of Lydia Foote.

Goward&#x27;s singing talents were noticed by the Ipswich writer Elizabeth Cobbold and she encouraged her to take to the stage. After some experience in the provinces, she first appeared on the stage in London on 2 July 1825 in the opera &quot;Rosina&quot;. It was not long before she gave up singing parts in favour of drama proper, where her powers of character-acting could have scope.

In June 1829 she married Robert Keeley (1793-1869), an admirable comedian, with whom she had often appeared. Between 1832 and 1842 they acted at Covent Garden, at the Adelphi with John Buckstone, at the Olympic with Charles Mathews, and at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with William Charles Macready. In 1836 they visited America. In 1838 she made her first great success as Nydia, the blind girl, in a dramatized version of Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;, and followed this with an equally striking impersonation of Smike in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;.

In 1839 came her decisive triumph with her picturesque and spirited acting as the hero of a play founded upon Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot;. So dangerous was considered the popularity of the play, with its glorification of the prison-breaking felon, that the Lord Chamberlain ultimately forbade the performance of any piece upon the subject. It is perhaps mainly as Jack Sheppard that Keeley lived in the memory of playgoers, despite her long subsequent career in plays more worthy of her remarkable gifts.

Under Macready&#x27;s management she played Nerissa in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, and Audrey in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. She managed the Lyceum Theatre with her husband from 1844 to 1847; acted with Benjamin Webster and Charles Kean at the Haymarket; returned for five years to the Adelphi; and made her last regular public appearance at the Lyceum in 1859.

A public reception, organised by the artist Walter Goodman, was held for her at this theatre on her 90th birthday. To mark this birthday, Keeley addressed a message to fellow-actresses by way of a letter to &quot;The Gentlewoman&quot;, which was reported in the Court Circular column in &quot;The Times&quot;: 

Keeley died in 1899 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

Mary Anne and Robert Keeley had two daughters, Mary Lucy (circa 1830-1870) and Louise (1835-1877), both of whom followed their parents on to the stage. Mary Lucy married the writer Albert Richard Smith, while Louise married the criminal advocate Montagu Williams, later Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

<text>The Proton Tiara is a Malaysian automobile based on the Citroën AX, built under licence by the automobile manufacturer Proton between 1996 and 2000.

==History==

The genesis of the Tiara was the result of an agreement during the mid 1990s, between Proton&#x27;s then CEO, Yahaya Ahmad, and PSA Peugeot Citroën, a producer of Citroën and Peugeot vehicles. Yahaya had expressed wishes that Proton did not use Mitsubishi platforms, and that Proton cooperated with PSA Peugeot Citroën for access to its diesel engines. 

In April 1996, Proton began a separate joint venture with PSA to build the Tiara called USPD (Usahasama Proton DRB Sdn. Bhd.).

Yahaya Ahmad was killed in a helicopter crash in 1997, and Proton returned to using recycled Mitsubishi based platforms and parts and developed in-house designed models later. Production of the Tiara ceased in 2000, due to low sales volume; in June 2005, the Proton Savvy was launched, as an indirect successor to the Proton Tiara or Citroën AX.

==Design and market==
The appearance of the Tiara mimicked that of more powerful Citroën AXs, such as the AX GT, but the grille was restyled to match the existing Saga and Wira models. Other cosmetic differences included different bumpers and taillight clusters. It was only available with a 1.1 litre engine, paired with a five speed manual.

The Tiara sold in two variants, the material coloured bumper 1.1 GL and full body paint 1.1 GLi, and came with six colour options; silver, red, royal blue, dark green, greenish blue and grey. The Proton Tiara was sold only in the Malaysian market, as the license restricted Proton from exporting the car.

<doc id="737328" wikidata="Q756769" url="?curid=737328" title="1998 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1998 Atlantic hurricane season was a catastrophic and deadly Atlantic hurricane season, which had the highest number of storm-related fatalities in over 218 years and some of the costliest ever at the time. The season had above average activity, due to the dissipation of an El Niño event and transition to La Niña conditions. It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. 
The season had a rather slow start, with no tropical cyclones forming in June.
The first tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Alex, developed on July 27, and the season&#x27;s final storm, Hurricane Nicole, became extratropical on December 1.

Several storms made landfall or directly affected land. Hurricane Bonnie made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane in late August, killing five people and causing about $1 billion in damage. Hurricane Earl caused $79 million in damage and three deaths after making landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane.

The most notable storms were Hurricane Georges and Hurricane Mitch. Georges devastated Saint Kitts and Nevis, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as a major Category 3 storm but peaked as a high-end Category 4 hurricane just before moving through many of the Caribbean Islands before affecting the southern US mainland, making its landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, causing significant damage and at least 600 confirmed deaths. Mitch was a destructive Category 5 hurricane that affected much of Central America before making landfall in Florida as a tropical storm. It caused significant damage and killed at least 11,000 people in Central America, and was the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history, behind only the Great Hurricane of 1780. Georges and Mitch caused $9.37 billion in damage and $6.08 billion (1998 USD) in damage, respectively. As a whole, and the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season was, at the time, the second-costliest season on record, after the 1992 season.

==Season forecasts==
In advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&#x27;s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center&#x27;s, William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. As stated by NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981–2010 contains roughly 12 tropical storms, 6 hurricanes, 3 major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) Index of 66–103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, of below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.

CSU began issuing outlooks in December 1997 and initially predicted 9 named storms, 5 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes would occur in the upcoming season. Later, in April 1998, CSU released a forecast calling for 10 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The predictions by CSU in June and August 1998 remained the same as the forecast in April. Additionally, forecasters at CSU predicted that the El Niño event that began in 1997 would dissipate either before or shortly after the 1998 season began. The WRC predicted 8 named storms and 5 hurricanes in early 1998, but did not include a forecast for the number of major hurricanes.
==Seasonal summary==


The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1998, with the first tropical cyclone developing on July 27. It was an above average season in which 14 tropical cyclones formed. All fourteen depressions attained tropical storm status and ten of these became a hurricane. Three hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The dissipation of an El Niño in April and the development of a La Niña by June was attributed to the above average activity. Three hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused at least 19,618 deaths and nearly $17.1 billion in damage. Hurricane Danielle also caused damage, although it never made landfall. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Nicole, dissipated on December 1, which was the day after the official season ending on November 30.

Activity in the season began very slowly, with the first tropical cyclone not forming until July 27. It did not become Tropical Storm Alex until July 29, which was an abnormally late first named storm for an Atlantic hurricane season. After being dormant for about two weeks, Hurricane Bonnie developed on August 19. Thereafter, tropical cyclogenesis became more frequent, with an additional three storms by the end of August. September was the most active month, coinciding with the climatological peak of the season. Six tropical cyclones formed in that month, four of which reached hurricane intensity. Four hurricanes were active on September 26, with Georges over the Straits of Florida, Ivan in the North Atlantic, Jeanne was located near Cape Verde, and Karl was situated over the Central Atlantic. This was the first such occurrence since August 22 in 1893. However, three hurricanes also co-existed in the Atlantic on September 11 in 1961, with a possible fourth. Following a busy September, activity began slowing, starting in October, when only two tropical cyclones developed. However, both storms became a hurricane, with the second cyclone, Hurricane Mitch, become the most intense and deadliest storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season.

Overall, the season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 182. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength.
==Systems==

===Tropical Storm Alex===

A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on July 26 and rapidly developed a surface circulation by the following day. As a result, it is estimated that Tropical Depression One formed at 1200 UTC on July 27, while centered about south-southwest of Cape Verde. Initially, minimal change in structure or convection occurred. However, after an increase in deep convection and satellite intensity estimates of , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alex early on July 29. Under the influence of a deep-layer ridge, the storm tracked west to west-northwestward at . A mid- to upper-level trough located north and west of Alex generated vertical wind shear starting on July 30, allowing for minimal intensification.

Later on July 30, a burst in deep convection resulted in slight strengthening of the storm. At 0000 UTC on July 31, Alex attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of and a minimum atmospheric pressure of . Vertical wind shear prevented Alex from strengthening further and instead caused it to weaken later that day. By August 1, the low-level circulation became exposed to the south of the remaining deep convection. Later that day, Alex curved northwestward and avoided any threat to the Lesser Antilles. At 1800 UTC on August 1, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. Early on the following day, Alex was considered dissipated after a reconnaissance aircraft failed to locate a closed low-level circulation. 
===Hurricane Bonnie===
Tropical Depression Two developed from a tropical wave at 1200 UTC on August 19, while located well east of the Lesser Antilles. After tracking west-northwestward for 24 hours, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie. While at tropical storm intensity, Bonnie passed north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on August 21. Early on the following day, a hurricane hunter aircraft indicated that the storm strengthened into a hurricane. Bonnie curved north-northwestward on August 23, shortly before it peaked with winds of . The storm weakened slightly before making landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina with winds of early on August 27. The storm briefly weakened to a tropical storm later on August 27, though it re-strengthened into a hurricane as it was re-emerging into the Atlantic. Colder waters weakened Bonnie to a tropical storm by late on August 28. The storm then accelerated east-northeastward offshore New England and Atlantic Canada, before becoming an extratropical cyclone on August 30.

In South Carolina, strong winds were reported, particularly in Charleston, Georgetown, and Horry Counties. Many trees and power lines were downed in the area; there was also structural damage. The storm caused two deaths and about $25 million in losses in South Carolina. Strong winds lashed Eastern North Carolina, downing numerous trees and power lines, which left about 500,000 people without electricity. One person was killed in Barco when a tree fell on a house. In North Carolina alone, damage reached at least $240 million. Erosion was also severe, with numerous docks, piers, and bulkheads either damaged or destroyed; many protective dunes constructed after Hurricane Fran in 1996 were ruined. In Virginia, strong winds in the eastern portions of the state caused some structural damage and downed trees and power lines, leaving about 750,000 people without electricity. Damage in Virginia reached approximately $95 million. Two other fatalities were reported, one in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and the other at Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Later in its duration, Bonnie brought rough seas, strong winds, and light rainfall to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, but caused little damage. Overall, there were five deaths and at least $720 million in damage, while other sources claimed that losses reached $1 billion. 
===Tropical Storm Charley===
An area of disturbed weather developed into Tropical Depression Three at 0600 UTC on August 21, while located about east-southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The depression moved generally northwestward throughout its duration. Based on data from oil platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Charley at 1800 UTC on August 21. The storm intensified further, with reconnaissance aircraft reporting sustained winds of at 0600 UTC on August 22. Shortly thereafter, Charley weakened and only four hours later, it made landfall near Port Aransas, Texas with winds of . Late on August 22, the system weakened to a tropical depression. Charley persisted as a tropical cyclone for about 24 hours longer, before dissipating near Del Rio, Texas.

Heavy rainfall was reported throughout southern Texas. Del Rio recorded of precipitation in a 24‑hour period, a record for the city. Charley was also responsible for serious local flooding in Val Verde County, Texas, where collectively about 2,000 houses, mobile homes, and apartments were destroyed. In that county alone, damage was estimated at $40 million. Throughout Texas, losses reached about $50 million and 13 deaths were confirmed, with an additional 6 people listed as missing. Flooding also occurred in northern Mexico, especially in the state of Coahuila. Ciudad Acuña was inundated with up to of water, which damaged about 450 houses in the city; seven deaths were also reported in the area.
===Hurricane Danielle===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 21. Convection quickly organized and by 0600 UTC on August 24, Tropical Depression Four developed while located about west-southwest of Cape Verde. Favorable conditions allowed strengthening, with an upgrade to Tropical Storm Danielle later that day. The storm sharply intensified and became a hurricane on August 25. Strengthening continued, with Danielle peaking with winds of on August 26. However, the storm oscillated in intensity for several days, ranging from a minimal Category 1 to a strong Category 2 hurricane, due to differing atmospheric conditions. While passing north of the Lesser Antilles, Danielle dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing street flooding and damaging at least one home. Damage in Puerto Rico totaled to $50,000.

Additionally, Danielle crossed seas in the wake of Hurricane Bonnie, also contributing to weakening. After tracking west-northwest for several days, an anticyclone curved the storm to the northeast while it was located northeast of the Bahamas on August 31. By early on September 2, Danielle weakened to a Category 1 hurricane, as it was passing northwest of Bermuda. Danielle produced tropical storm force winds on the island. Thereafter, the storm continued to slowly weaken and lose tropical characteristics. At 0000 UTC on September 4, Danielle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located east-southeast of Newfoundland. The remnant extratropical cyclone reached the British Isles on September 6, before merging with an extratropical low-pressure area two days later. Offshore Newfoundland, rogue waves were reported, though the only effects on land were light rainfall. The remnant extratropical storm associated with Danielle lashed the United Kingdom with large waves. Severe beach erosion and coastal flooding occurred, causing evacuations in Cornwall, England.
===Hurricane Earl===
Tropical Depression Five developed from a tropical wave in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico at 1200 UTC on August 31, while located about midway between Mérida, Yucatán and Tampico, Tamaulipas. The depression is estimated to have strengthened into Tropical Storm Earl six hours later, while located about south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana. The storm headed north-northeastward and was difficult to track, due to multiple centers on satellite imagery. Earl slowly curved east-northeastward and continued strengthening, with reconnaissance aircraft data indicating that the storm reached hurricane intensity at 1200 UTC on September 2. It briefly became a Category 2 hurricane about six hours later and peaked with winds of . However, the storm weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane early on September 3, before landfall near Panama City, Florida with winds of . Earl rapidly weakened to a tropical storm about six hours later and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Georgia late on September 3.

Prodigious precipitation fell during its transit of northern Florida, with near of Panama City. In Gulf County, 300 homes were damaged by high winds and floodwaters. At Port St. Joe, storm surge inundated 14 businesses. Storm surge in Franklin County damaged 136 homes and 15 businesses and led to a brief closure of the St. George Causeway. In Wakulla County, 216 homes and businesses were damaged by high winds and flooding. Severe flooding in coastal Taylor County caused significant damage in nine communities, with 66 structures impacted. Five homes were destroyed and 39 others were damaged by flooding in Dixie County. On September 3, the strongest tornado spawned by Earl in Florida touched down in Citrus County, where it destroyed 8 homes and damaged 24 others. There were 3 fatalities and about $76 million in damage in Florida. In other states, heavy rainfall and tornadoes resulted in severe localized damage, particularly in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. A third storm-related fatality occurred in Saint Helena, South Carolina caused by a tornado. Overall, Earl caused 3 deaths and about $79 million in damage.
===Tropical Storm Frances===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Six on September 8, while located about east of Brownsville, Texas. The depression moved south-southwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Frances on September 9. Frances then executed a small cyclonic loop, moving westward, southward, and then northeastward. By September 10, the storm moved quickly northward. After re-curving northwestward, Frances peaked with winds of early on September 11, but later then weakened slightly. At 0600 UTC, the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas with winds of . Frances slowly weakened inland and continued northwestward. Early on September 12, it curved northward, while weakening to a tropical depression. The storm degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure at 1800 UTC on September 13, while located over northeastern Texas.

The precursor to Frances produced heavy rainfall in Mexico, peaking at in Escuintla, Chiapas. Severe flooding was also reported in the United States, particularly in Louisiana and Texas. Rainfall from the storm in the United States peaked at in Terrytown, Louisiana. Flooding was worst in Calcasieu Parish, where over 20 homes in the Deatonville area reported water damage. Tides in Cameron Parish were the highest since Hurricane Carla, causing significant coastal flooding. In Texas, flooding was particularly severe in the eastern portions of the state. More than 1,400 homes and businesses in the Houston area alone were either damaged or destroyed by the floods. In the United States, there was about $500 million in damage, as well as two fatalities in Louisiana. 
===Hurricane Georges===
Tropical Depression Seven developed from a tropical wave on September 15, while located south of Cape Verde. It tracked west-northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Georges on September 16. Favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperature and good upper-level outflow allowed the storm to rapidly deepen. By September 20, Georges peaked as a Category 4 hurricane, before increasing vertical wind shear caused it to weaken. The storm&#x27;s winds were when it made landfall in Antigua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Puerto Rico on September 21. Georges made another landfall in the Dominican Republic with winds of on September 22. It weakened significantly over Hispaniola, and late on September 23, Georges struck eastern Cuba with winds of . The storm tracked inland near the north coast of Cuba, retaining hurricane-force winds. On September 25, the storm struck Key West with winds of . After heading northwestward for three days, Georges struck Biloxi at the same intensity. Georges quickly weakened to a tropical depression on September 29, by which time it turned eastward through the Southeastern United States. By October 1, it dissipated close to the Atlantic Ocean near the Florida-Georgia border.

About 2,125 homes were either damaged or destroyed in Antigua and Barbuda, with property losses reaching $160 million; there were also 3 deaths. Roughly 60% of structures on Saint Kitts were damaged, as were 35% of structures in Nevis. Five deaths and $445 million in damage were reported in Saint Kitts and Nevis. Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico left 96% of the island without electricity, impacted at least 100,610 homes, wiped out more than two-thirds of crops, and caused 8 deaths and $2 billion in losses. Heavy precipitation in Dominican Republic caused mudslides, which left about 155,000 homeless and damaged buildings and road infrastructure. Additionally, it destroyed 55% of crops, caused at least 380 deaths, and left about $1.2 billion in losses. The situation was similar in Haiti, where mudslides left 167,332 people homeless, at least 80% of certain crops ruined, 209 persons dead, and about $179 million in damage. In Cuba, mudslides and strong winds damaged 60,475 homes, of which 3,481 were completely destroyed. Additionally 1,117 businesses were damaged, of which 12 were destroyed. Extensive crops losses also occurred. Six deaths and $305.8 million in damage were reported in Cuba.
Hurricane-force winds in the Florida Keys damaged 1,536 houses and destroyed 173 homes. In the Florida Panhandle, flooding was extensive because of rainfall up to . Many residents were isolated and 132 roads were closed due to flooding. In Alabama, 251 houses, 16 apartment buildings, and 70 businesses experienced significant impacts at Gulf Shore. About 50 houses were destroyed and another 40 were left uninhabitable on Dauphin Island, Alabama. One fatality was reported in Mobile when a woman was driving and slid off the road into a creek. Mississippi bore the brunt of the storm in the United States. Along the coast of Mississippi, more than 1,000 homes were flooded. One of the worst impacted areas inland was Stone County, where 54 homes had minor damage, 26 suffered major damage and 5 were destroyed. Winds also left 230,000 people without electricity. In the state of Mississippi alone, there was approximately $665 million in losses. In Louisiana, the storm caused three indirect deaths, while strong winds and storm surge impacted at least 70 homes, destroyed 85 fishing camps, and left 160,000 people without electricity. Overall, Georges caused at least 615 deaths and roughly $9.37 billion in losses.
===Tropical Storm Hermine===
A tropical wave crossed the Africa coast and entered the Atlantic Ocean on September 5. It tracked westward for several days, until curving northwestward in the Caribbean Sea near the coast of South America. By September 16, the system entered the Gulf of Mexico and quickly developed into Tropical Depression Eight on September 17. The depression executed a cyclonic loop, first heading west-southwest, then south, before curving northeast and finally northward. By September 19, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine. The storm continued north-northeastward until it made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana with winds of at 0500 UTC on September 20. Hermine rapidly weakened inland and dissipated in Mississippi late on September 20.

The outer bands of Hermine dropped heavy rainfall throughout Florida. Several traffic accidents occurred as a result, with one man dying after losing control of his vehicle on U.S. Route 441. Effects overall in Louisiana were minimal, mostly minor flooding. At Lake Cataouatche, a man went to untangle debris in his boat propeller and attempted to swim after the boat, but instead drowned. Hermine spawned two tornadoes in Mississippi, one of which destroyed two mobile homes, damaged seven cars, and caused one injury. Locally heavy rainfall left parts of Mississippi Highway 27 and U.S. Route 11 in Alabama under water, stranding several motorists. The remnants of Hermine produced more than of rain in Charleston, South Carolina, leaving more than of standing water in some neighborhoods. Overall, the storm caused 2 deaths and $85,000 in damage.
===Hurricane Ivan===

A tropical wave developed over western Africa near the Prime meridian on September 14. Two days later, residual cloudiness and sounding data from Dakar, Senegal, indicated that the system entered the Atlantic Ocean. After the system quickly developed deep convection and improved significantly in organization, it was classified as Tropical Depression Nine starting at 0000 UTC on September 19, while located approximately southwest of Cape Verde. The depression initially tracked west to west-southwestward with slow intensification, due to vertical wind shear. By September 20, an elongated trough turned the depression northwestward. Later that day, the depression strengthened enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Ivan.

On September 21, Ivan re-curved northward, while still in the far eastern Atlantic. While heading north-northwestward on September 23, the storm briefly weakened, but quickly re-strengthened and became a hurricane later that day. Two days later, Ivan began slowly turning northeastward. At 0600 UTC on September 26, Ivan attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum atmospheric pressure of . As it was tracking east-northeastward, Ivan briefly posed a threat to the Azores, though tropical storm or hurricane-force winds did not impact the archipelago. Shortly thereafter, colder sea surface temperatures weakened Ivan to a tropical storm by early on September 27. Six hours later, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while northeast of the Azores.
===Hurricane Jeanne===

Between September 19 and September 20, a slow-moving tropical wave crossed the west coast of Africa. By the following day, an increase in deep convection allowed it to be classified as Tropical Depression Ten. Forming about west of Guinea-Bissau, it was the easternmost tropical cyclone development in the Atlantic basin since Tropical Storm Christine in 1973. Due to light wind shear, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jeanne by 1800 UTC on September 21. Further significant intensification occurred and Jeanne became a hurricane about 24 hours later. Late on September 23, the storm became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. At 1800 UTC on September 24, Jeanne attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of .

After peaking as a moderate Category 2 hurricane, an increase in vertical wind shear slowly weakened the storm. Around that time, Jeanne began curving northwestward. By late on September 25, the storm was downgraded back to a Category 1 hurricane. Three days later, a trough forced Jeanne to accelerate toward the north-northeast. It re-strengthened slightly on September 28, though the storm began weakening again. Late on September 29, Jeanne was downgraded to a tropical storm. Shortly before weakening further to a tropical depression on October 1, a wind gust of was reported on Horta in the Azores. The storm then passed through the Azores, but lost tropical characteristics by 1200 UTC on October 1. The remnant extratropical cyclone struck Portugal on October 4 and became unidentifiable over Spain later that day.
===Hurricane Karl===

A non-tropical low-pressure system was first noted on the coast of the Carolinas on September 21. Deep convection became better organized, and on September 23, the system was designated as Tropical Depression Eleven while located near Bermuda. Initially, the depression moved quickly towards the east, ahead of a frontal boundary moving off the East Coast of the United States. Early on September 24, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl. At the time, the storm began curved east-southeastward and slowed in forward speed. By later that day, westerly and northwesterly wind shear caused the center to become partially exposed from the deep convection. Despite this, Karl strengthened into a hurricane at 1200 UTC on September 25.

In response to a large mid- to upper-level trough, Karl accelerated towards the northeast. Shortly after developing a well-defined eye, the storm reached its peak intensity of at 0000 UTC on September 27. However, wind shear caused Karl to begin weakening. Later on September 27, satellite imagery indicated that the cyclone was beginning to lose tropical characteristics. Deep convective activity was limited to the north and northwest of the center, and the low-level center became separated from the center of the cloud circulation. Karl weakened to a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on September 28, while located near the Azores. Later that day, the storm became extratropical over cooler waters, when the center of circulation became separated from the deep convection. The extratropical remnants were last noted south of Ireland on September 29.
===Hurricane Lisa===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 29. The system soon became unidentifiable within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, preventing quick development. However, by October 3, the system became more distinguishable and better-defined, with a low-level circulation forming on October 4. It was reported that Tropical Depression Twelve formed at 0000 UTC on October 5, while located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles. Although strong wind shear kept the depression disorganized, it was able to intensify into Tropical Storm Lisa about six hours later. Because of unfavorable conditions, further intensification was deemed unlikely. Lisa initially tracked northwestward, though by October 6, an upper-level low-pressure system caused the storm to turn northeastward.

A baroclinic trough within the westerlies transitioned into a deep low, causing Lisa to accelerate starting on October 7. Despite winds of at a buoy and an improved appearance on satellite imagery, no strengthening was predicted. By October 8, convection persisted near the center and banding features developed. Lisa further accelerated, with forward speed reaching over on October 9. Later that day, a deep low to the west and a strong high-pressure system to the east caused Lisa to turn northward. At 1200 UTC on October 9, Lisa unexpectedly strengthened into a hurricane, simultaneously peaking with winds of . Later that day, the storm began merging with an extratropical frontal system and eventually became unidentifiable by early on October 10.
===Hurricane Mitch===

Tropical Depression Thirteen was spawned by a tropical wave on October 22, while located offshore Colombia in the Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the depression became Tropical Storm Mitch, and within two days it intensified into a hurricane. While curving westward, the storm rapidly deepened, reaching its peak as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of and a minimum pressure of late on October 26. Mitch weakened significantly while turning to the south, and on October 29 it moved ashore with winds of east of La Ceiba, Honduras. It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, but did not deteriorate into a tropical depression until October 31 while over Central America. Mitch degenerated into a low-pressure area on November 2 near the border of Mexico and Guatemala, although it was re-designated a tropical storm on November 3, after emerging into the Bay of Campeche. After turning to the northeast, the storm struck the city of Campeche early on November 4, and Mitch briefly weakened into a tropical depression over the Yucatán Peninsula. The storm re-intensified after reaching the Gulf of Mexico again, and Mitch made its final landfall near Naples, Florida with winds of on November 5. Shortly thereafter the storm became extratropical near the northern Bahamas, which lasted several more days while crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

Heavy rainfall in Jamaica flooded numerous houses and caused three fatalities from mudslides. Strong winds, rough seas, and large amounts of precipitation resulted in minor effects in Cuba and the Cayman Islands. Offshore Honduras, the &quot;Fantome&quot; sank, drowning all 31 people on board. In Honduras, the large and slow-moving storm dropped of rain, causing the destruction of at least 70% of the country&#x27;s crops and an estimated 70-80% of road infrastructure. About 25 villages were completely dismantled, while about 33,000 homes were destroyed and another 50,000 were damaged. Damage totaled about $3.8 billion in Honduras and at least 7,000 fatalities were reported. In Nicaragua, rainfall totals may have reached . Over of roads required replacement or repairs, while effects to agriculture were significant. Almost 24,000 houses were destroyed and an additional 17,600 were damaged. About 3,800 deaths and $1 billion in damage were reported in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, the storm impacted 2,135 homes, of which 241 were destroyed. Extensive road infrastructure and crop damage was also reported. There were 7 people killed and $92 million in damage in Costa Rica.

The storm caused flooding as far south as Panama, where three fatalities occurred. Flash flooding and landslides in El Salvador damaged more than 10,000 homes, of roadway, and caused heavy losses to crops and livestock. Damage totaled $400 million and 240 deaths were confirmed. Effects were similar but slightly more significant in Guatemala, where 6,000 houses were destroyed and an additional 20,000 were impacted to some degree. Additionally, of roads were affected, with nearly of it being major highways. Crop damage in Guatemala alone was nearly $500 million. It was reported that 268 deaths and $748 million in losses occurred in Guatemala. The storm caused relatively minor effects in Mexico and Belize, with 9 and 11 fatalities in both countries, respectively. Mitch brought tropical storm winds to South Florida and rainfall up to . In the Florida Keys, several buildings that were damaged by Georges were destroyed by Mitch. Tornadoes in the state spawned by Mitch damaged or destroyed 645 houses. The storm caused two fatalities and $40 million in damage in Florida. Overall, Mitch caused $6.08 billion in losses and at least 11,374 people were left dead.
===Hurricane Nicole===
An intense frontal low that persisted near the Canary Islands gradually acquired tropical characteristics and a low-level circulation. Tropical Depression Fourteen developed at 0000 UTC on November 24, while located about west-southwest of La Palma, Canary Islands. Due to light wind shear, Nicole was able to strengthen swiftly while tracking west-southwestward, reaching winds of later that day. However, on November 25, wind shear increased, causing the storm to weaken. By 1200 UTC on November 26, Nicole was downgraded to a tropical depression. The low-level circulation became almost entirely devoid of deep convection. As a result, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Nicole at 1500 UTC on November 26 and did not forecast re-development. However, post-analysis indicates that Nicole remained a tropical cyclone.

At 1500 UTC on November 27, the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories after Nicole unexpectedly &quot;regenerated&quot;. Deep convection began re-developing and about three hours later, Nicole was upgraded back to a tropical storm. Under the influence of a cold front, Nicole curved northeastward starting on November 27. While crossing sea surface temperatures that were above normal, the storm began to significantly intensify. After development of an eye and increasing satellite intensity estimates, Nicole was upgraded to a hurricane early on November 30. Twenty-four hours later, Nicole attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of and a minimum atmospheric pressure of . However, Nicole weakened to a tropical storm later on December 1, while also losing tropical characteristics. By 1800 UTC that day, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located northwest of the Azores. Nicole was the most intense Atlantic storm recorded in the month of December.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1998. This is the same list used in the 1992 season, with the exception of &quot;Alex&quot;, which replaced &quot;Andrew&quot;. The names &quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Lisa&quot;, &quot;Mitch&quot;, and &quot;Nicole&quot; were used for the first (and only in the case of &quot;Mitch&quot;) time this year.

===Retirement===

The World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;Georges&quot; and &quot;Mitch&quot; in the spring of 1999 from the Atlantic hurricane name lists on account of their destructiveness. They were replaced by &quot;Gaston&quot; and &quot;Matthew&quot; for the 2004 season.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1998 USD.

<text>Elbridge Trask also known as Eldridge Trask (July 15, 1815 – June 23, 1863) was an American fur trapper and mountain man in the Oregon Country. Immortalized by a series of modern historical novels by Don Berry, he is best known as an early white settler along Tillamook Bay on the coast of the U.S. state of Oregon. The Trask River and Trask Mountain along the Northern Oregon Coast Range are also named after him.

==Early life==
Elbridge Trask (aka Eldridge Trask) was born on July 15, 1815, in Beverly, Massachusetts. He was the son of John and Bethiah Trask.

==Frontiersman==
In 1835, Elbridge Trask joined the employ of the Columbia River Fishing and Trading Company of Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth. In December he arrived at Fort Hall in present-day Idaho and joined his first trapping expedition with experienced mountain men the following December. Much of what is known about this portion of his life comes from the journals of his traveling companion Osborne Russell. In January 1838 he camped at Jackson Hole with Jim Bridger and spent the next year acquiring a large number of beaver pelts in the Yellowstone area. In August 1839, he became separated from his party, which waited for him for several days until threat of an attack from the Blackfoot forced his party to return to Fort Hall. The following month he returned to Fort Hall by himself unharmed. On August 22, 1842, while in the Snake River valley, he and Osborne Russell joined a wagon train led by the missionary Dr Elijah White headed the Willamette Valley.

==Marriage and family==
While serving as a guide for the wagon train, Elbridge Trask met Hannah Able, a young widow from Indiana with a baby daughter traveling with the William T. Perry wagon. On arriving at Willamette Falls at present-day Oregon City, the two were married on October 20, 1842.

Elbridge Trask and his wife Hannah set up a homestead in Clatsop Plains near Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River. In 1852, they left the Clatsop Plains to settle near Tillamook Bay south along the coast. They were the first white family to settle in the bay, establishing a homestead along the Trask River, which is named for him. Trask Mountain in the Northern Oregon Coast Range is also named after him.

As conflict between the white settlers and the natives of the Tillamook region grew, Trask met with the last free leaders of the Tillamook people, Chief Kilchis and Chief Illga, to negotiate a peace agreement, but conflicts continued intermittently.

==Death==
Elbridge Trask died on June 23, 1863, near Tillamook in Tillamook County, Oregon. He was buried on his own property.

==Descendants==
Elbridge Trask is further survived by a number of his great-grandchildren, including Jaycee Miller and Leif Schueler. There is a Trask family reunion yearly at the Trask River.

==In popular culture==
In 1960 Elbridge Trask was popularized in the historical novel &quot;Trask&quot; by Don Berry. The novel, as well as its two sequels, are collectively known as the &quot;Trask novels.&quot;

<text>Queen Alia International Airport () is an international airport located in Zizya, 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Amman, the capital and largest city of Jordan. It is the largest airport in the country, named after Queen Alia, who died in a helicopter crash in 1977. The airport is home to the country&#x27;s flag carrier, Royal Jordanian, and serves as a hub for Jordan Aviation.

==History==


===Foundation and early years===
Queen Alia International Airport (QAIA) was built in 1983 in response to the growing airport traffic needs that Amman Civil Airport could not accommodate. At the time, passenger traffic was increasing at a rate above the international average, recording 25–30% growth per annum and placing considerable pressure on airport facilities despite continuous expansion and development. In 1981, the number of arriving, departing, and transit passengers exceeded 2.3 million, while cargo traffic reached 62,000 tonnes and aircraft traffic topped 27,000 movements.

The Jordanian Ministry of Transport undertook the building of a new international airport with sufficient capacity to cope with demand in the foreseeable future. QAIA was built at an estimated total cost of JOD 84 million (~120 million USD as of January 2023) . Passenger facilities were designed to serve 3.5 million passengers per year. QAIA has since grown to become the kingdom&#x27;s primary international gateway and a stop-over for international airlines in the Middle East. By 2012, QAIA was serving on average more than 6 million passengers and 40 airlines from around the world.

In 2007, the Government of Jordan selected Airport International Group (AIG) through an open tender to operate, rehabilitate and manage QAIA under a 25-year concession agreement. In response to the continual surge in passenger traffic at the time, AIG was also placed in charge of constructing a new terminal, one which not only would expand the airport&#x27;s then insufficient annual capacity of 3.5 million passengers, but that would also introduce a &quot;unique travel experience&quot; to help advance QAIA&#x27;s position as a niche transit hub in the region.

Accordingly, AIG invested an estimated $750 million USD in the construction of the new terminal.
The new terminal accommodates rising annual passenger traffic, taking the original airport capacity from 3.5 million passengers per year to 7.5 million.

A new terminal was opened in March 2013 to replace the airport&#x27;s older two passenger terminals and one cargo terminal. The three original terminals were made obsolete once the new terminal officially began operations. Inaugurated by King Abdullah II on 14 March 2013, the new airport was launched officially following an overnight operational transfer which coincided the airport&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The last flight departed from the old terminal at 10:05 pm on 20 March 2013, upon which all operations were shifted to the new terminal, where its first flight departed at 2:30 am on 21 March 2013. On 20 January 2014, AIG launched the second phase of QAIA&#x27;s expansion, valued at a total cost of over $100 million USD.

===Development since 2015===
In 2016, the second expansion phase, costing $1 billion, was completed raising QAIA&#x27;s annual passenger traffic capacity to 12 million, supporting Jordan&#x27;s national tourism strategy to serve as a regional transit hub for leisure and business travel. The aim is to boost its capacity to 16 million passengers annually by the end of the concession time frame in 2032. Following the airport expansion, Emirates operated a one-off Airbus A380 service to Amman, celebrating 30 years of Emirates&#x27; operation to Jordan. The superjumbo (registration A6-EUC) operated EK901/EK902 on 25 September 2016, and it was the first-ever A380 service to the Levant. Since then, Emirates has continued daily A380 service to Amman through EK903/EK904.

On 14 March 2020, it was announced by the Jordanian Ministry of Health that &quot;...all flights to and from the Kingdom will be suspended from Tuesday, 17 March 2020, until further notice, excluding commercial freight traffic.&quot; The airport had been closed to passenger traffic since 17 March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, several Royal Jordanian flights were commissioned to return Jordanian citizens, especially students, back to Jordan during the pandemic if they desired.

On 8 September 2020, the airport was reopened for commercial flights but was subject to strict health and safety regulations. On 1 March 2022, all travel restrictions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic were subsequently lifted.

==Terminal==
QAIA&#x27;s new design was created by architects Foster + Partners. The roof was inspired by Bedouin tents and is composed of 127 concrete domes, each weighing up to 600 metric tonnes.

The airport has three lounges, one operated by Royal Jordanian for business and first-class passengers, one operated by Airport Hotel next to the North Concourse, and the last exclusively run by telecom operator Zain Jordan for its VIP customers. Retail space was expanded by 25% at the new terminal, covering more than . The terminal houses several international food and beverage venues. In addition to restaurants and supermarkets, the terminal also includes a nuts roastery, a large Duty-Free area, a children&#x27;s play area, shopping outlets, and internet connectivity.

==Airport management==
Airport International Group (AIG) is a French company formed to rehabilitate, expand, and operate Queen Alia International Airport under a 25-year Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) concession agreement. The concession was awarded to AIG in 2007 by the Government of Jordan after an open international tender that was overseen by the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank acting as an advisor to the Government.

In 2023, QAIA became the first airport in the Middle East to achieve Level 3 of the Airport Customer Experience Accreditation (ACEA).

According to a statement from Airport International Group (AIG), QAIA also became one of eight airports in the Middle East and one of sixty one airports all around the world to have received ACEA.

The global &quot;Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Survey&quot; for Q1 2014 ranked QAIA first place in 18 different service and facility categories from ten airports across the Middle East. QAIA came in at 13th place from amongst 81 airports worldwide within the group of airports serving 5–15 million passengers and recorded an Overall Satisfaction Score of 4.42 out of a possible 5.0, an improvement compared to its 4.23 score in Q4 2013. Regarding luggage delivery speed, QAIA earned a 4.13 score, up from 3.99 during the previous quarter.

QAIA received two 2013 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards in February 2014, ranking at first place in the category of &quot;Best Improvement by Region: Middle East&quot; and 5th in the category of &quot;Best Airport by Region: Middle East.&quot; The ASQ Awards results were based on the ASQ Survey, an international airport passenger satisfaction benchmark program. In the 2014 version of the awards, QAIA again received the &quot;Best Improvement in the Middle East region&quot; award.

In March 2013, QAIA was named one of the world&#x27;s top 40 public–private partnership PPP projects, receiving Gold recognition as &quot;Best Emerging Market Infrastructure Project for Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa&quot; in &quot;Emerging Partnerships&quot;. The winning PPPs, selected from among projects nominated by governments, industry, NGOs, academia and other organizations following a global call for submissions, demonstrated best practices for governments working with the private sector to provide a wide range of public services and to spur economic development in their countries.

In June 2013, QAIA became the second airport in the Middle East to achieve the &quot;Mapping&quot; level of the Airport Carbon Accreditation program run by Airports Council International Europe. The &#x27;Mapping&#x27; level recognizes the airport&#x27;s commitment to determining its carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emission sources at its operational boundary, as well as to engaging a third party to verify the airport&#x27;s annual carbon footprint.

==Ground transport==
The airport is connected to Amman by shuttle buses that ply back and forth between Amman and the airport every 30 minutes. An airport taxi service as well as car rental is also available. A shuttle bus is available to transport passengers between the terminal and car park.

<doc id="737366" wikidata="Q15075189" url="?curid=737366" title="Soup spoon">
<text>A soup spoon is a type of spoon with a large or rounded bowl, used for consuming soup. The term can either refer to the British soup spoon or the Chinese spoon. Round bowled soup spoons were a Victorian invention. Sets of silverware made prior to about 1900 do not have round soup spoons; a tablespoon was used (and still is in some British houses where the silver predates 1900).

==Western==

The British soup spoon is the length of a dessert spoon (i.e., smaller than a tablespoon) but with a deeper, more circular bowl for holding liquid. Modern soup spoons are usually stainless steel or silver-plated, but in the past wooden and horn spoons were more common. The idea of including a separate soup spoon in a table setting originated in the eighteenth century, when the bowl shapes varied widely, deep or shallow, oval, pointed, egg-shaped or circular. Spoon shapes became more standardized in nineteenth-century silverware.

The rounded form of soup spoon is not generally used in continental Europe, where an oval-shaped spoon is traditionally used.

==Chinese==
The Chinese soup spoon, usually ceramic and of a distinct shape, can vary in size from normal soup spoon size to near-platter size.

<doc id="737420" wikidata="Q6772544" url="?curid=737420" title="Marquess of Halifax">
<text>The title Marquess of Halifax was created in the Peerage of England in 1682 for the George Savile, 1st Earl of Halifax.

He had previously been created Baron Savile, of Elland in the County of York, Viscount Halifax in 1668, and [[Earl of Halifax]] in 1679, all also in the Peerage of England. The baronetcy, styled &quot;of Thornhill in the County of York&quot;, had been created in the Baronetage of England in 1611 for his great-grandfather George Savile. All peerages became extinct on the death of the 2nd Marquess in 1700. The baronetcy was inherited by a kinsman, the 6th Baronet, and became extinct on the death of the 8th Baronet in 1784.

The courtesy title used by the heir apparent to the earldom and marquessate was Lord Elland, taken from the territorial designation of the barony of Savile. The family seat was originally Thornhill Hall, which was destroyed in the English Civil War, after which the seat was transferred to Rufford Abbey.

==Family==
The 1st Marquess&#x27;s sister married the 1st Earl of Plymouth. His daughter by his first wife (daughter of the 1st Earl of Sunderland) married the 3rd Earl of Carbery. His daughter by his second wife (sister of the 1st Duke of Kingston) married the 3rd Earl of Chesterfield.

The 2nd Marquess was son of the first by his first marriage. He married Mary Finch, a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Nottingham and Lady Essex Rich. Essex was daughter of the 3rd Earl of Warwick and Anne Cheeke. Anne was daughter of Sir Thomas Cheeke of Pirgo and a senior Essex Rich. The elder Essex was daughter of the 1st Earl of Warwick and Penelope Devereux, Lady Rich. Essex was probably named after her maternal grandfather the 1st Earl of Essex. Her maternal grandmother was Lettice Knollys. William Savile was father-in-law to the 4th Earl of Cork, the 7th Earl of Thanet and the 4th Earl of Elgin.

==The Savile estates==
The 8th and last Savile Baronet bequeathed the Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire estates (including Rufford Abbey and Thornhill) of the family on his nephew, The Hon. Richard Lumley-Saunderson, later 6th Earl of Scarbrough, younger son of the 4th Earl of Scarbrough and Barbara Savile, sister and heiress of Sir George Savile. Eventually, in 1887, the Savile estates passed to his great-nephew, the diplomat John Lumley-Savile, who assumed the surname of Savile only and was created Baron Savile the following year.

<doc id="737423" wikidata="Q990440" url="?curid=737423" title="Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)">
<text>Dáil Éireann () served as the directly elected lower house of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1937. The Free State constitution described the role of the house as that of a &quot;Chamber of Deputies&quot;. Until 1936 the Free State Oireachtas also included an upper house known as the Seanad. Like its modern successor, the Free State Dáil was, in any case, the dominant component of the legislature; it effectively had authority to enact almost any law it chose, and to appoint and dismiss the President of the Executive Council (prime minister). The Free State Dáil ceased to be with the creation of the modern &#x27;Dáil Éireann&#x27; under the terms of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland. Both the Dáil and Seanad sat in Leinster House.

==Composition==

Under the Free State constitution, membership of Dáil Éireann was open to all citizens who had reached the age of twenty-one. However those who were legally disqualified or who were members of the Seanad were excluded. For most of the period of the Irish Free State the constitution also contained a controversial requirement that all members of the Oireachtas swear an oath of fidelity to the King, which caused Sinn Féin to refrain from taking any seats, as well as an Oath of Allegiance to the constitution of the Free State. The oath was, however, abolished by a constitutional amendment in 1936.

As today, during the Irish Free State, Dáil Éireann was elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. However, the franchise was restricted to those over twenty-one. As adopted, the constitution required that a Dáil&#x27;s term would last for four years, unless the law specified a shorter period or the house was dissolved early. However, after changes to the constitution and the law in 1927, the constitutional maximum became six years, and the legal maximum five1. The Dáil could theoretically have been dissolved at any time by the King, acting on the advice of Executive Council, but it is probable that the Free State would have broken all constitutional ties if that had happened.

The Free State constitution required that the Dáil be elected by &quot;proportional representation&quot; and the Single Transferable Vote system was used. While every Irish Government since 1937 has restricted Dáil constituencies to a maximum of five seats, during the Irish Free State, there were several six, seven and eight seat constituencies. During the Free State, Galway was a single nine seat constituency.

As well as geographical constituencies, the Free State also included two university constituencies: Dublin University and the National University. The franchise for the university constituencies was open to all those who had been awarded degrees from either institution. However anyone voting in a university constituency was excluded from voting in their geographical district. The constitution required that each return three TDs, regardless of population. Because these constituencies had much lower populations that the ordinary geographical constituencies this resulted in malapportionment. The university constituencies were abolished in 1936 under the Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Act and the Electoral (University Constituencies) Act. However, in 1937 university constituencies would be revived for the newly created Senate. The following general elections took place to the Free State Dáil during its existence:
*1922 general election
*1923 general election
*June 1927 general election
*September 1927 general election
*1932 general election
*1933 general election
*1937 general election

==Powers==

The Free State constitution provided that the President of the Executive Council would be appointed by the King &quot;on the nomination of&quot; the Dáil and that the Executive Council as a whole had to resign &quot;en bloc&quot; if it lost the confidence of the lower house. In practice these provision meant that the President was chosen by the Dáil, which could bring down his cabinet by a vote of no confidence, or failure to approve a vote of confidence. A constitutional amendment passed in 1936 removed the role of the King entirely and provided that, in the final months of the Free State, the President would be elected by the Dáil directly, rather than merely being &#x27;nominated&#x27; by the lower house.

Technically a bill had to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and to receive the Royal Assent to become law. However, in practice it was the Dáil that decided what laws would be enacted and repealed. Before its complete abolition the Free State Seanad merely had power to delay legislation.

While during the early years of the Irish Free State there existed a theoretical possibility that the King, or the Governor-General acting on his behalf, might veto an act of the Oireachtas or dismiss the Executive Council against the wishes of the Dáil. (This occurred in 1975 in Australia when the Governor-General John Kerr dismissed the government and forced an election.) With the passage of the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927 the British Government lost the right to formally advise the King in relation to the Free State and so the possibility of the Governor-General taking any action without the approval of the other institutions of government became very remote.

Unlike its modern successor, the Free State Dáil did not have authority to declare war, this power being reserved for the Oireachtas as a whole. However, in practice this distinction was not important. During the later days of the Irish Free State the Dáil, as the dominant component of the Oireachtas, had the effective authority to amend the constitution in any way it chose. Today this is a level of authority that no Dáil has had since 1941.

==History==
From 1919 to 1922 &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; served as the revolutionary, unicameral parliament of the Irish Republic. The First Dáil and the Second Dáil thus existed outside, or in parallel to, of British law. The Third Dáil was elected under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty as a constituent assembly to approve the Free State constitution and pave the way for the creation of the new state. However, once the Constitution of the Irish Free State was in effect the Third Dáil served as the lower house of a new parliament, called the Oireachtas. Under the terms of the constitution, however, the Third Dáil merely carried out the functions of the Dáil during this period until a new chamber could be elected. The first Dáil of the Irish Free State was therefore officially the Fourth Dáil, which was elected in 1923.

On 29 December 1937 the Constitution of Ireland came into force and the Irish Free State was succeeded by a state know today as Ireland. The new constitution had been adopted by plebiscite on 1 July of that year, and on the same day the Ninth Dáil was elected. The Ninth Dáil was therefore elected as the lower house of the Free State Oireachtas but in December its role changed to that of lower house of a new legislature.

==Footnotes==
#The constitutional maximum was increased from four to six years by the Constitution (Amendment No. 4) Act, 1927. The five-year legal maximum was imposed by the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1927.

<doc id="737429" wikidata="Q2474430" url="?curid=737429" title="Affirmation (Savage Garden album)">
<text>Affirmation is the second and final studio album by Australian pop duo Savage Garden, released on 1 November 1999 by Columbia Records. It won the 2000 ARIA Music Award for Highest Selling Album. It was nominated for Best Group and Best Pop Release.

==Background==
The band recorded their second studio album after they recorded &quot;The Animal Song&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Other Sister&quot;. The majority of the album was written by Hayes in New York in September 1999 or slightly earlier that year. The exception was &#x27;You Can Still Be Free&#x27;, a much older song that dated back to at least 1995 - a demo recording appeared on their 1995 demo tape, then titled &#x27;Free&#x27;. The track was written in tribute to a friend of the band who died by suicide some years previously, and was revisited after said friends&#x27; family explained they loved the song and wanted to see it released on an album. Preceded by the second single &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, the album was released on 9 November 1999 to worldwide success. The album spawned a further five singles, one of which was exclusive to the Australian market (&quot;Chained to You&quot;), and one of which was exclusive to the British market (&quot;The Best Thing&quot;).

Following the success of the &quot;Superstars and Cannonballs&quot; video album, the album was reissued in November 2000, containing a bonus live album, &quot;Declaration&quot;, featuring recordings from the concert at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre on 21 May 2000. Including sales of the re-issue, the album has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide, being certified platinum in a number of countries. It became the band&#x27;s last studio album after Daniel decided to leave in 2001.

Similarly to &quot;Savage Garden&quot;, the album&#x27;s track listing varied internationally. The Australian version of the album features a bonus remix of &quot;The Animal Song&quot;, a CD-ROM featuring video footage and bonus material, and the uncut version of &quot;Gunning Down Romance&quot;. The International version removes the remix, CD-ROM and features a cut version of &quot;Gunning Down Romance&quot;, due to a manufacturing error where six seconds of music are cut between 4:36 and 4:42, causing the music to stop abruptly.

<doc id="737439" wikidata="Q415496" url="?curid=737439" title="Dopamine receptor">
<text>Dopamine receptors are a class of G protein-coupled receptors that are prominent in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Dopamine receptors activate different effectors through not only G-protein coupling, but also signaling through different protein (dopamine receptor-interacting proteins) interactions. The neurotransmitter dopamine is the primary endogenous ligand for dopamine receptors.

Dopamine receptors are implicated in many neurological processes, including motivational and incentive salience, cognition, memory, learning, and fine motor control, as well as modulation of neuroendocrine signaling. Abnormal dopamine receptor signaling and dopaminergic nerve function is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, dopamine receptors are common neurologic drug targets; antipsychotics are often dopamine receptor antagonists while psychostimulants are typically indirect agonists of dopamine receptors.

==Subtypes==

The existence of multiple types of receptors for dopamine was first proposed in 1976. There are at least five subtypes of dopamine receptors, D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. The D1 and D5 receptors are members of the D1-like family of dopamine receptors, whereas the D2, D3 and D4 receptors are members of the D2-like family. There is also some evidence that suggests the existence of possible D6 and D7 dopamine receptors, but such receptors have not been conclusively identified.

At a global level, D1 receptors have widespread expression throughout the brain. The relative amount of DA receptors is in the following order: D1 &gt; D2 &gt; D3 &gt; D5 &gt; D4. D1-2 receptor subtypes are found at 10–100 times the levels of the D3-5 subtypes.

===D1-like family===
The D1-like family receptors are coupled to the G protein Gsα. D1 is also coupled to Golf.

Gsα subsequently activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the intracellular concentration of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

* D1 is encoded by the Dopamine receptor D1 gene ().
* D5 is encoded by the Dopamine receptor D5 gene ().

===D2-like family===
The D2-like family receptors are coupled to the G protein Giα, which directly inhibits the formation of cAMP by inhibiting the enzyme adenylyl cyclase.

*D2 is encoded by the Dopamine receptor D2 gene (), of which there are two forms: D2Sh (short) and D2Lh (long):
** The &quot;D2Sh&quot; form is pre-synaptically situated, having modulatory functions (viz., autoreceptors, which regulate neurotransmission via feedback mechanisms. It affects synthesis, storage, and release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft).
** The &quot;D2Lh&quot; form may function as a classical post-synaptic receptor, i.e., transmit information (in either an excitatory or an inhibitory fashion) unless blocked by a receptor antagonist or a synthetic partial agonist.
* D3 is encoded by the Dopamine receptor D3 gene (). Maximum expression of dopamine D3 receptors is noted in the islands of Calleja and nucleus accumbens.
* D4 is encoded by the Dopamine receptor D4 gene (). The D4 receptor gene displays polymorphisms that differ in a variable number tandem repeat present within the coding sequence of exon 3. Some of these alleles are associated with greater incidence of certain disorders. For example, the D4.7 alleles have an established association with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

===Receptor heteromers===

Dopamine receptors have been shown to heteromerize with a number of other G protein-coupled receptors. Especially the D2 receptor is considered a major hub within the GPCR heteromer network. Protomers consist of

Isoreceptors
*D1–D2
*D1–D3 
*D2–D3 
*D2–D4 
*D2–D5 

Non-isoreceptors
*D1–adenosine A1
*D2–adenosine A2A
*D2–ghrelin receptor
*D2sh–TAAR1 (an autoreceptor heteromer)
*D4–adrenoceptor α1B
*D4–adrenoceptor β1

==Signaling mechanism==

Dopamine receptor D1 and Dopamine receptor D5 are Gs coupled receptors that stimulate adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP, which in turn increases intracellular calcium and mediates a number of other functions. The D2 class of receptors produce the opposite effect, as they are Gαi and/or Gαo coupled receptors, which blocks the activity of adenylyl cyclase. cAMP mediated protein kinase A activity also results in the phosphorylation of DARPP-32, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1. Sustained D1 receptor activity is kept in check by Cyclin-dependent kinase 5. Dopamine receptor activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II can be cAMP dependent or independent.

The cAMP mediated pathway results in amplification of PKA phosphorylation activity, which is normally kept in equilibrium by PP1. The DARPP-32 mediated PP1 inhibition amplifies PKA phosphorylation of AMPA, NMDA, and inward rectifying potassium channels, increasing AMPA and NMDA currents while decreasing potassium conductance.

===cAMP independent===
D1 receptor agonism and D2 receptor blockade also increases mRNA translation by phosphorylating ribosomal protein s6, resulting in activation of mTOR. The behavioral implications are unknown. Dopamine receptors may also regulate ion channels and BDNF independent of cAMP, possibly through direct interactions. There is evidence that D1 receptor agonism regulates phospholipase C independent of cAMP, however implications and mechanisms remain poorly understood. D2 receptor signaling may mediate protein kinase B, arrestin beta 2, and GSK-3 activity, and inhibition of these proteins results in stunting of the hyperlocomotion in amphetamine treated rats. Dopamine receptors can also transactivate Receptor tyrosine kinases.

Beta Arrestin recruitment is mediated by G-protein kinases that phosphorylate and inactivate dopamine receptors after stimulation. While beta arrestin plays a role in receptor desensitization, it may also be critical in mediating downstream effects of dopamine receptors. Beta arrestin has been shown to form complexes with MAP kinase, leading to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Furthermore, this pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the locomotor response mediated by dopamine receptor D1. Dopamine receptor D2 stimulation results in the formation of an Akt/Beta-arrestin/PP2A protein complex that inhibits Akt through PP2A phosphorylation, therefore disinhibiting GSK-3.

==Role in the central nervous system==
Dopamine receptors control neural signaling that modulates many important behaviors, such as spatial working memory. Dopamine also plays an important role in the reward system, incentive salience, cognition, prolactin release, emesis and motor function.

==Non-CNS dopamine receptors==

===Cardio-pulmonary system===
In humans, the pulmonary artery expresses D1, D2, D4, and D5 and receptor subtypes, which may account for vasodilatory effects of dopamine in the blood. Such receptor subtypes have also been discovered in the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium of the heart. In rats, D1-like receptors are present on the smooth muscle of the blood vessels in most major organs.

D4 receptors have been identified in the atria of rat and human hearts. Dopamine increases myocardial contractility and cardiac output, without changing heart rate, by signaling through dopamine receptors.

===Renal system===
Dopamine receptors are present along the nephron in the kidney, with proximal tubule epithelial cells showing the highest density. In rats, D1-like receptors are present on the juxtaglomerular apparatus and on renal tubules, while D2-like receptors are present on the glomeruli, zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex, renal tubules, and postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals. Dopamine signaling affects diuresis and natriuresis.

=== The Pancreas ===
The role of the pancreas is to secrete digestive enzymes via exocrine glands and hormones via endocrine glands. Pancreatic endocrine glands, composed of dense clusters of cells called the Islets of Langerhans, secrete insulin, glucagon, and other hormones essential for metabolism and glycemic control. Insulin secreting beta cells have been intensely researched due to their role in diabetes.

Recent studies have found that beta cells, as well as other endocrine and exocrine pancreatic cells, express D2 receptors and that beta cells co-secrete dopamine along with insulin. Dopamine has been purported to be a negative regulator of insulin, meaning that bound D2 receptors inhibit insulin secretion. The connection between dopamine and beta cells was discovered, in part, due to the metabolic side-effects of certain antipsychotic medications. Traditional/typical antipsychotic medications function by altering the dopamine pathway in the brain, such as blocking D2 receptors. Common side effects of these medications include rapid weight gain and glycemic dysregulation, among others. The effects of these medications are not limited to the brain, so off-target effects in other organs such as the pancreas have been proposed as a possible mechanism.

=== Adipose Tissue ===
Dopamine receptors D1, D2, D4, and D5 are present in human subcutaneous, visceral, and brown adipose tissue, and have been implicated in lipid and glucose metabolism, and thermogenesis. Dopamine that reaches dopamine receptors in adipose tissue can originate from multiple sources: from the circulation, sympathetic nerves innervating adipose tissue that release dopamine from nerve terminals, local synthesis, or immune cells

==In disease==
Dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the CNS has been implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including social phobia, Tourette&#x27;s syndrome, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, schizophrenia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and drug and alcohol dependence.

===Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder===

Dopamine receptors have been recognized as important components in the mechanism of ADHD for many years. Drugs used to treat ADHD, including methylphenidate and amphetamine, have significant effects on neuronal dopamine signaling. Studies of gene association have implicated several genes within dopamine signaling pathways; in particular, the D4.7 variant of D4 has been consistently shown to be more frequent in ADHD patients. ADHD patients with the 4.7 allele also tend to have better cognitive performance and long-term outcomes compared to ADHD patients without the 4.7 allele, suggesting that the allele is associated with a more benign form of ADHD.

The D4.7 allele has suppressed gene expression compared to other variants.

===Addictive drugs===
Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter involved in the reward and reinforcement (mesolimbic) pathway in the brain. Although it was a long-held belief that dopamine was the cause of pleasurable sensations such as euphoria, many studies and experiments on the subject have demonstrated that this is not the case; rather, dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway is responsible for behaviour reinforcement (&quot;wanting&quot;) without producing any &quot;liking&quot; sensation on its own. Mesolimbic dopamine and its related receptors are a primary mechanism through which drug-seeking behaviour develops (Incentive Salience), and many recreational drugs, such as cocaine and substituted amphetamines, inhibit the dopamine transporter (DAT), the protein responsible for removing dopamine from the neural synapse. When DAT activity is blocked, the synapse floods with dopamine and increases dopaminergic signaling. When this occurs, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, increased D1 and decreased D2 receptor signaling mediates the &quot;incentive salience&quot; factor and can significantly increase positive associations with the drug in the brain.

=== Pathological gambling ===
Pathological gambling is classified as a mental health disorder that has been linked to obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder and behavioral addiction. Dopamine has been associated with reward and reinforcement in relation to behaviors and drug addiction. The role between dopamine and pathological gambling may be a link between cerebrospinal fluid measures of dopamine and dopamine metabolites in pathological gambling. Molecular genetic study shows that pathological gambling is associated with the TaqA1 allele of the Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) dopamine receptor. Furthermore, TaqA1 allele is associated with other reward and reinforcement disorders, such as substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders. Reviews of these studies suggest that pathological gambling and dopamine are linked; however, the studies that succeed in controlling for race or ethnicity, and obtain DSM-IV diagnoses do not show a relationship between TaqA1 allelic frequencies and the diagnostic of pathological gambling.

===Schizophrenia===

While there is evidence that the dopamine system is involved in schizophrenia, the theory that hyperactive dopaminergic signal transduction induces the disease is controversial. Psychostimulants, such as amphetamine and cocaine, indirectly increase dopamine signaling; large doses and prolonged use can induce symptoms that resemble schizophrenia. Additionally, many antipsychotic drugs target dopamine receptors, especially D2 receptors.

===Genetic hypertension===
Dopamine receptor mutations can cause genetic hypertension in humans. This can occur in animal models and humans with defective dopamine receptor activity, particularly D1.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
Parkinson&#x27;s disease is associated with the loss of cells responsible for dopamine synthesis and other neurodegenerative events. Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients are treated with medications which help to replenish dopamine availability, allowing relatively normal brain function and neurotransmission. Research shows that Parkinson&#x27;s disease is linked to the class of dopamine agonists instead of specific agents. Reviews touch upon the need to control and regulate dopamine doses for Parkinson&#x27;s patients with a history of addiction, and those with variable tolerance or sensitivity to dopamine.

==Dopamine regulation==

Dopamine receptors are typically stable, however sharp (and sometimes prolonged) increases or decreases in dopamine levels can downregulate (reduce the numbers of) or upregulate (increase the numbers of) dopamine receptors.

Haloperidol, and some other antipsychotics, have been shown to increase the binding capacity of the D2 receptor when used over long periods of time (i.e. increasing the number of such receptors). Haloperidol increased the number of binding sites by 98% above baseline in the worst cases, and yielded significant dyskinesia side effects.

Addictive stimuli have variable effects on dopamine receptors, depending on the particular stimulus. According to one study, cocaine, opioids like heroin, amphetamine, alcohol, and nicotine cause decreases in D2 receptor quantity. A similar association has been linked to food addiction, with a low availability of dopamine receptors present in people with greater food intake. A recent news article summarized a U.S. DOE Brookhaven National Laboratory study showing that increasing dopamine receptors with genetic therapy temporarily decreased cocaine consumption by up to 75%. The treatment was effective for 6 days. Cocaine upregulates D3 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, further reinforcing drug seeking behavior. and Caffeine increases striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in the human brain, Caffeine, or other more selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonists, causes significantly less motor stimulation in dopamine D2 receptor.

Certain stimulants will enhance cognition in the general population (e.g., direct or indirect mesocortical DRD1 agonists as a class), but only when used at low (therapeutic) concentrations. Relatively high doses of dopaminergic stimulants will result in cognitive deficits.

<text>Wilfred Bouma (; born 15 June 1978) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played most notably for PSV Eindhoven, Aston Villa and the Netherlands national team.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Helmond, North Brabant, Bouma started his career at amateur club SV Rood-Wit &#x27;62 before joining PSV on a youth contract in 1994. The PSV head coach at the time, Aad de Mos handed him his professional debut against Willem II on 26 October 1994 which his team lost 2–1. After not featuring for a long time, he was loaned out to MVV in 1996 and played in the Eerste Divisie where he scored seven goals in 18 games. The following season, he scored sixteen goals in 33 games after helping his team back into the Eredivisie. After impressing at Fortuna Sittard in 1998–99, he was drafted back into the PSV squad the following season.

===PSV===
At PSV, he played as a left winger and as forward because of his quick pace and direct passing, teaming up with Arnold Bruggink and at times, with Ruud van Nistelrooy.

When Arthur Numan departed to Rangers at the end of the 1999–00 season, Bouma was moved to left-back where he had to compete with Danish international Jan Heintze.

With the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers entering its crucial stages, Bouma was handed his international debut for the Netherlands national team against the Republic of Ireland on 2 September 2000. In the Euro 2004 tournament in Portugal, he was chosen by Dick Advocaat to play as a central defender and he has also retained that spot while playing for PSV under Guus Hiddink in the 2004–05 season.

===Aston Villa===

Just before the close of the international transfer window, Bouma signed for Aston Villa on 30 August 2005 for £3.5 million. He struggled to establish himself during the 2005–06 campaign at Villa Park, as his debut season was heavily tarnished with injuries. However, when Martin O&#x27;Neill replaced boss David O&#x27;Leary, Bouma – after recovering from a hamstring injury – replaced stand-in left-back Gareth Barry.

Under O&#x27;Neill, Bouma begun to flourish during the 2006–07 season – he established himself as first choice left back and went on to total 28 appearances in the claret and blue shirt. This turn in form also attributed to Bouma reclaiming his place in the Netherlands national team, playing in the friendly against Russia in February 2007, the tour of Asia in June 2007 and the following UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying fixtures.

On 9 February 2008, Bouma – who was in the process of making his 76th appearance in claret and blue – netted his only goal for the club in the 48th minute of the match against Newcastle United. The deflected goal levelled the game at 1–1, before a hat-trick by teammate John Carew, wrapped up a 4–1 victory.

Upon returning from international duty for the Netherlands at Euro 2008, Bouma participated in both legs of Aston Villa&#x27;s Intertoto Cup third round tie against Odense, however the second leg at Villa Park on 26 July 2008 was marred by a serious ankle injury to the full-back. Bouma caught his studs on the turf as he attempted to challenge opposition forward Baye Djiby Fall. Initially, the injury looked like a break, however reports later confirmed that Bouma had suffered a dislocation, an injury which looked set to keep him out until October. His recovery however took much longer. Bouma&#x27;s increasing importance to the Villa cause, as well as his &#x27;cult-hero status&#x27; was noted as he was carried off early in the tie whilst being accompanied by a 30,000 strong chant of support by the Villa faithful.

On 9 September 2008, Bouma signed a new two-year deal at Villa Park with the option of a third year.

In January 2009, it was announced that Bouma, along with other long-term absentee John Carew had returned to full training. He was scheduled to return on 16 February for the reserves but he pulled out at the last minute because he &quot;felt sore&quot;. On 2 March 2009, Bouma finally played 90 minutes in a 4–3 win in a reserve match against Chelsea. However, he suffered a setback on his road to recovery in April after learning bone fragments had broken away from his ankle, and underwent surgery soon after.

On 16 September 2009, after being out of action for fourteen months, it was announced that Bouma had resumed full training with the club. Yet to make a return to Villa&#x27;s first team, Bouma suffered another setback and was again out of action with a stubbed toe injury.

On 29 January 2010, Aston Villa announced that Bouma had finally returned to full training following eighteen months of absence through injury. However, while Bouma played a full ninety minutes for the Aston Villa reserves in February 2010, he never made a return to the first team. On 6 May 2010, Aston Villa confirmed that Bouma was set to leave the club at the end of the 2009–2010 season. Bouma said his goodbyes to the Villa faithful during half-time of the home defeat to Blackburn in their final league game, later stating that he intended to address the fans but &quot;just couldn&#x27;t do it&quot; after becoming too emotional.

===Return to PSV===
On 26 June 2010, it was revealed that Bouma&#x27;s former club PSV Eindhoven had offered him a trial at the club in an attempt to revive his career and he joined up with the rest of the PSV squad for pre-season training. Bouma later sealed his return on 30 August 2010, signing a two-year contract with the club. Bouma scored his first goal since his return to the Netherlands in a 3–0 home win against VVV-Venlo. Bouma played 66 minutes during a record Eredivisie 10–0 victory over Feyenoord.

Bouma continued his good goal scoring form when he netted his third goal in only 16 league games during the 3-0 away win against VVV-Venlo. On 24 February 2011, Bouma was handed the captain&#x27;s armband for the final five minutes of the UEFA Europa League match against Lille that PSV went on to win 3–1 on the day and 5–3 on aggregate.

==International career==

Bouma was a member of the Dutch squad at the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship. As of July 2008, Wilfred Bouma has played for the Netherlands 35 times, scoring twice. Bouma made his debut on 2 September 2000, in the 2–2 draw with the Republic of Ireland. Several steady appearances followed in the coming years, including four appearances at UEFA Euro 2004, whilst playing as a centre-back.

Bouma was also included in the Dutch squad for UEFA Euro 2008, and he made two appearances, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute against France and playing the full 90 minutes against Romania. Bouma&#x27;s only two goals at international level came within four months of each other, as the defender netted in the 3–2 defeat to Czech Republic in the group stage of Euro 2004. He then went on to net the opener against Macedonia in October of the same year, in a match which ended 2–2.

==Coaching career==
Bouma did an internship in 2015 as a youth coach at PSV. Since 2019, he has been an assistant coach at Jong PSV, under head coach Peter Uneken.

==Personal life==
Bouma was born in the Netherlands and is of Surinamese and Indonesian descent. He lives in Eindhoven.

<doc id="737454" wikidata="Q535403" url="?curid=737454" title="The Dalles Dam">
<text>The Dalles Lock and Dam is a concrete-gravity run-of-the-river dam spanning the Columbia River, east of the city of The Dalles, Oregon, United States. It joins Wasco County, Oregon, with Klickitat County, Washington, upriver from the mouth of the Columbia near Astoria, Oregon. The closest towns on the Washington side are Dallesport and Wishram.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began work on the dam in 1952 and completed it five years later. Slack water created by the dam submerged Celilo Falls, the economic and cultural hub of Native Americans in the region and the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in North America. Inhabitants of the submerged area include the Wasco–Wishram and Skinpah.

On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as the rising waters rapidly silenced the falls, submerged fishing platforms, and consumed the village of Celilo. Ancient petroglyphs were also in the area being submerged. Approximately 40 petroglyph panels were removed with jackhammers before inundation and were placed in storage before being installed in Columbia Hills State Park in the 2000s.

The reservoir behind the dam is named Lake Celilo and runs up the river channel, to the foot of John Day Dam. The dam is operated by the USACE, and the power is marketed by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). It is part of an extensive system of dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers.

The Dalles Dam Visitor Center, in Seufert Park on the Oregon shore, was built in 1981. A tour train was closed in autumn 2001, partly due to post-September 11 security concerns, and partly due to deteriorating track conditions and a small derailment. The Columbia Hills State Park is nearby.

The Dalles Dam is one of the ten largest hydroelectric dams in the United States. Along with hydro power, the dam provides irrigation water, flood mitigation, navigation, and recreation. The Dalles Lock and Dam has been designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

== Environmental and social consequences ==

Prior to the construction of the dam, Celilo Falls was a hub for local Native American trading and fishing. The area served as a spiritual monument as well, and continues to be the site of traditional ceremonies, during which people celebrate the end of winter and the beginning of the spring salmon run.

The construction of the Dalles Dam was extremely damaging to salmon runs in the Columbia River. The physical dam makes it difficult for fish to navigate the river and reach their spawning grounds. Even with the installation of fish ladders, salmon populations have struggled.

Celilo Falls and the traditional rights of local Native American tribes to fish were protected by a government treaty, but with the onset of the Cold War and the legacy of Bonneville Dam, completed in 1938, the USACE looked to develop another hydro power production facility on the Columbia River. The Dalles&#x27; location on the mid-Columbia River below the falls made it an ideal hydro power production site. The Dalles Dam was authorized under the 1950 Flood Control Act, with the federal government able to work around the treaty with local tribes by paying them a settlement. However, despite assurances from the USACE that they would work to improve living conditions in Celilo as part of the settlement, these efforts failed for lack of attention by the federal government.

Since 2016, the USACE has worked on The Dalles Lock &amp; Dam Tribal Housing Village Development Plan. This plan is designed to find a location for and construct a village for members of the tribes that historically relied on Celilo Falls for fishing. The Village Development Plan had been slated to be finished by fall of 2020, however, as of April 2023 it has not been completed. In 2017, various senators from the states of Oregon and Washington signed a letter to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, expressing concern about the Office&#x27;s plan to halt the project.

In 2007, the USACE conducted a sonar survey of the riverbed of Celilo Falls to determine whether the former site of the falls had been destroyed by the construction of the dam. The survey found that the geological features on the riverbed match those observed in photos of the falls prior to the construction of the dam. Hypothetically, this establishes that the falls would return if the dam were to be removed.

<doc id="737458" wikidata="Q374778" url="?curid=737458" title="Edgar Prado">
<text>Edgar S. Prado (born June 12, 1967) is a retired Peruvian jockey in thoroughbred horse racing.

Prado&#x27;s big break came in 1997 when he won 536 races, making him the fourth rider in history to win 500 races in one year. Much of that success was gained in Maryland, where he ruled that circuit for several years.

A resident of Hollywood, Florida, in 2004 Prado became the 19th jockey in thoroughbred racing history to win 5,000 races. Edgar is married to Liliana and has three children named Edgar Jr, Louis and Patricia. Louis works as a scribe at Joe DiMaggio Children&#x27;s Hospital in Hollywood, Florida.

==Career==
On May 6, 2006, Prado rode Barbaro to victory in the 132nd Kentucky Derby, 6½ lengths ahead of the second finisher, Bluegrass Cat. The margin of victory was the largest since Triple Crown winner Assault won by eight lengths in 1946. Barbaro was pulled up following a horrific ankle injury during the Preakness Stakes two weeks later. Prado was visibly moved, declining comment, but by all accounts his fast action on the track contributed to saving the colt&#x27;s life. (However, Barbaro was euthanized by veterinarians at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s New Bolton Center on January 29, 2007.)

Other racing accomplishments include victories in the 2002 and 2004 Belmont Stakes, in each case aboard a longshot depriving a favorite of the United States Triple Crown. In 2002 Prado won the Belmont aboard Sarava, who is the longest shot to ever win the Belmont Stakes in its history at odds of 70¼/1. In 2004 Prado rode Birdstone to victory in the Belmont, denying heavy favorite Smarty Jones the Triple Crown. Prado and Birdstone then went on to win the prestigious Travers Stakes at the Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York in August 2004.

Prado had not won a Breeders&#x27; Cup race until 2005, when he won two, riding Folklore to victory in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Fillies and Silver Train in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Sprint.

On September 24, 2006, Prado received the New York Racing Association&#x27;s 2006 Mike Venezia Memorial Award in a paddock ceremony at Belmont Park. The winner of this award is decided by the votes of fellow jockeys, turf writers and an online vote by fans. It honors those &quot;...who exemplify extraordinary sportsmanship and citizenship&quot;, and is given in memory of Mike Venezia, killed on October 13, 1988 in a spill at Belmont Park.

On February 10, 2008 at Gulfstream Park, Edgar Prado achieved his 6000th win. Only 16 jockeys in the United States have achieved this record. 

Prado is involved with Belmont Park&#x27;s &quot;Anna House&quot;, a child day care centre providing care for the children of backstretch workers.

On August 4, 2008 he was formally inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame.

On October 31, 2015 he rode Runhappy to Breeder&#x27;s Cup Sprint victory setting a new track record.

On May 15, 2018 Prado became the 8. North American Rider to reach 7,000 wins.

On March 25, 2020, Prado tied for eighth on the all time win list with Angel Cordero, Jr with a win aboard Cory Gal in that day&#x27;s third race at Gulfstream Park.

Prado last rode on January 6, 2023 at Gulfstream. He announced his retirement on June 20, 2023, citing difficulties obtaining mounts and time missed with his family.

<doc id="737472" wikidata="Q3640798" url="?curid=737472" title="Mayors in Brazil">
<text>In Brazil, the mayor is the chief executive of the smallest territorial unit — the municipality () — and holds executive powers of the local government, in a &quot;strong mayor-council&quot; arrangement. In Portuguese, the mayor is called the &quot;prefeito&quot; (if male) or &quot;prefeita&quot; (if female), while the government itself is termed the &quot;prefeitura&quot;.

The current system of mayor and council (called the &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;) dates from the 1930 revolution and the Vargas era, albeit with changes how elections are conducted. Until 1982, Brazilian mayors were usually elected by the local population, with the exception of state capitals, international border towns, and &quot;national security zones&quot; (which included strategic mining places).

With the end of the military dictatorship and enacting of the 1988 Constitution, all mayors and councillors in the nation are elected every four years. Mayors are elected by a first past the post system in most municipalities—however, if its population is over 200,000, an outright majority is needed to win or the vote will go to a second round runoff election. The most recent election was held in 2020.

The federal capital, Brasília, has no mayor; instead, executive duties are carried out by the Governor of the Federal District.

The insular district of Fernando de Noronha which belongs to the State of Pernambuco doesn&#x27;t have a mayor, but has an administrator appointed by the Governor, the administrator performs the duties of a mayor during a four-year term, and like Brasília, the district doesn&#x27;t have municipal elections.

In Brazil, mayors of larger cities, such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, have considerable influence in national politics and are usually potential presidential candidates.

== Mayors of Brazilian state capitals as of April 2021 ==

*Maguito Vilela of the MDB was elected in 2020, but died during his term. Vice-mayor Rogério Cruz thus succeeded him.

**Bruno Covas of the PSDB was elected in 2020, but died during his term. Vice-mayor Ricardo Nunes thus succeeded him.

<doc id="737476" wikidata="Q1665608" url="?curid=737476" title="Iwo, Osun">
<text>Iwo is a city in Osun State, Nigeria. The Iwo people, like all other people of the Yoruba kingdom, are said to have originated from Ile-Ife, where they migrated sometimes in the 11th century according to Alademomi kenyon and Prince Adelegan Adegbola (2009). The only predicted land with the symbol of the parrots (which signifies the location of the promised land) is the Iwo kingdom. The city was formerly part of old Oyo state and was later separated and became one of the major townships in Osun State, Nigeria.

<doc id="737484" wikidata="Q599237" url="?curid=737484" title="Sandline affair">
<text>The Sandline affair was a political scandal that became one of the defining moments in the history of Papua New Guinea, and particularly the conflict in Bougainville. It brought down the government of Sir Julius Chan, and brought Papua New Guinea to the verge of a military revolt. The event was named after Sandline International, a United Kingdom-based private military company.

After coming to power in mid-1994, Prime Minister Chan made repeated attempts to resolve the Bougainville conflict by diplomatic means. These were ultimately unsuccessful, due to the repeated failure of Bougainvillean leaders Francis Ona, Sam Kauona and Joseph Kabui to arrive at scheduled peace talks. In November 1994, Chan attempted to set up the Bougainville Transitional Government, under a moderate Bougainvillean, Theodore Miriung. However, this too was doomed to failure, as Ona, Kauona, Kabui and others all chose not to take part. This was the last straw for Chan, and he decided to resolve the conflict using military force.

==First meetings==
Chan&#x27;s defence minister, Mathias Ijape, requested logistical assistance from Australia and New Zealand, in preparation for an assault on the island. However, both nations refused to provide any military assistance. The decision was then made to investigate the use of mercenaries. Through some overseas contacts, Ijape was put in contact with Tim Spicer (an ex-Lt Colonel in the Scots Guards) who had recently founded Sandline International, a company specialising in providing arms, equipment, and contractors to participate in conflicts.

Spicer attempted to persuade the head of the Papua New Guinea Defence Forces (PNGDF), Jerry Singirok, to support the purchase of a package of military equipment that he had previously discussed with Ijape. Singirok dismissed the idea, and concentrated on proceeding with a planned assault on the island, codenamed &quot;Operation High Speed II&quot;. However, the operation was a dismal failure, and within six days, Papua New Guinean forces had retreated from the island.

Later that year, Spicer met Chris Haiveta, the Deputy Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, and convinced him of the benefits of using Sandline mercenaries to end the Bougainville conflict permanently, neutralise the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, and reopen the controversial Panguna copper mine. While Singirok still refused to deal with Spicer, Haiveta invited him to visit the country and make an assessment of the situation. He did so in December 1996, and received US$250,000 as a result. He estimated that Sandline mercenaries could do the job for a total of US$36 million .

==Official dealings begin==

On 8 January 1997, Tim Spicer had his first meeting with Prime Minister Chan. Spicer succeeded in convincing Chan that Sandline could assist in retaking Bougainville before the upcoming elections. They agreed that Sandline would provide 44 special forces personnel, mainly British, South African and Australian, to fight alongside PNGDF personnel. The US$36 million was never voted upon by the full Cabinet of Parliament, but instead by the secretive National Security Council. Half was to be paid up front, with the other half to follow after completion of the mission. The money came from cutbacks to a number of ministries, including the education and health departments.

Sandline had subcontracted most of its crew for the Bougainville mission through Executive Outcomes, a South African mercenary provider. The first mercenaries arrived on an Air Niugini flight from Singapore on 7 February 1997. After a week, a total of 44 had arrived, 8 from the UK, 5 from Australia and the remainder from South Africa.

In the meantime, a series of meetings were undertaken between Deputy Prime Minister Haiveta, Tim Spicer, and several other figures, with regard to buying out CRA&#x27;s stake in Bougainville Copper Limited, the owner of the Panguna mine, which was at the heart of the Bougainville conflict. 

On 19 February 1997, Prime Minister Chan mentioned to Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer that Papua New Guinea was bringing in mercenaries for &quot;training purposes&quot;. Downer condemned the move, and was particularly opposed to their use on Bougainville. On 10 February, the move was leaked to &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper.

==Affair becomes public==
The immediate public stir in Australia was larger than Chan had expected.The international furor also hardened the dislike that Jerry Singirok had for the Sandline deal. By the time he returned from a visit to the Philippines on 27 February, his mind was made up. He condemned the government for leaving him, as head of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF), out of the loop, and condemned the fact that Spicer had more access to the government than he did. Over the next week, he made plans for &quot;Opareisen Rausim Kwik&quot; (). On 8 March, he asked Major Walter Enuma to command the operation. Enuma agreed.

Over the next few days, the Australian government tried in vain to persuade the Papua New Guinean government not to proceed with the mercenary deal. On the night of 16 March 1997, the revolt began. PNGDF soldiers were approached by leaders of the NGO Melanesian Solidarity (MELSOL). Jonathan O&#x27;ata and Peti Lafanama wanted to consolidate a military-NGO civil protest against the Chan-Haiveta decision to engage the Sandline mercenaries. By the time the night was over, the entire band of Sandline mercenaries had been disarmed and arrested. Prime Minister Chan did not find out until the next morning. That morning, Singirok accused Chan, Ijape, and Haiveta of corruption, and gave them 48 hours to resign. He also fiercely denied allegations that he was aiming to take power himself. Chan refused to resign, and the same day, sacked Singirok as Commander of the PNGDF, replacing him with controversial Colonel Alfred Aikung. The NGOs activated a nationwide protest in support of General Singirok.

The weapons, including Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships, piston engined light aircraft, military small arms and 600 crates of ammunition, were shipped in an Antonov An-124 Ruslan giant plane. The Antonov had been impounded in Thailand for a week after Papua New Guinea authorities refused to allow the aircraft to land. Australian diplomats and defence and intelligence chiefs had been involved in secret negotiations for days with Sandline and the governments of PNG and Thailand before agreeing to accept the weapons for storage in Australia. The Antonov was allowed to fly to Tindal RAAF base, near Katherine, Northern Territory, until the government of PNG arranged for the materiel to be returned to Sandline. 

The two attack helicopters remained in storage at RAAF Base Tindal until 2016, when they were buried at the Shoal Bay Landfill site near Darwin due to their dilapidated condition and possible contamination, for example with asbestos, and the cost of shipping them anywhere.

==Military standoff begins==

Singirok stated that he would accept the decision to fire him, and urged his soldiers to support his replacement. Chan told the media that Singirok had been neutralised and would be arrested. He also alleged that Singirok had attempted a coup, but had not had his men&#x27;s support behind him. However, Chan&#x27;s optimism turned out to be premature. The soldiers at the central Murray Barracks began to disobey orders, and police units had to be flown in from outside of the capital, Port Moresby. Two days later, a boycott of classes began at the University of Papua New Guinea in support of Singirok. Crowds of civilians blocked the roads around the barracks, and bomb hoaxes closed down government departments. 

Chan still continued to insist that he was in complete control, and accused Singirok of a plot to manipulate the price of copper. The following day, the protests turned somewhat violent, and looting began. The situation grew darker for Chan when Governor-General, Sir Wiwa Korowi, took out a newspaper advertisement that also accused the government of widespread corruption. Another two days saw Port Moresby almost grind to a halt.

The protests continued to get larger with each day, and the police and the army faced off against each other, with the army under Major Enuma&#x27;s strict orders to hold their positions and the police appeared in no hurry to confront the army. Enuma also instructed the army to halt the looting. The Australian government sent emissaries to Port Moresby, and threatened to withdraw financial aid altogether if the Sandline deal was not cancelled. Reluctantly, Chan cancelled the deal and announced an inquiry. While this meant that Singirok and Enuma had accomplished one of their major goals, they continued to demand the resignation of Chan, Ijape and Haiveta. On 21 March, all Sandline&#x27;s personnel, with the exception of Tim Spicer, who remained to give evidence to the enquiry, were withdrawn from Papua New Guinea.

Despite the cancellation of the Sandline contract, the security situation continued to slip further out of the government&#x27;s control. The Acting Commander, Alfred Aikung was attacked and his vehicle was burned. Aikung subsequently fled into hiding fearing for his life. Chan considered asking for foreign military intervention, but Aikung advised him against it. Speaker of Parliament and former Prime Minister Sir Rabbie Namaliu met with Chan and Singirok, and advised the latter that two of his demands had been met, but that Chan would resign only at the request of Parliament.

==Prime Minister Chan resigns==
The next session of Parliament began on 25 March, and Bill Skate, then Governor of Port Moresby, was ready to bring forth a motion calling on Chan to resign. On the night of 24 March, several members deserted the Chan government, and the capital once again came to a standstill. Soldiers at Murray Barracks demanded to be able to march on the Parliament, but Enuma steadfastly refused. Large crowds began to gather outside the Parliament. The police attempted to stop students from reaching the Parliament, but the soldiers escorted them in. Inside, Sir Michael Somare amended Skate&#x27;s motion, so it only called upon Chan to step down for the period of the inquiry. A fierce debate ensued, with the Parliament divided. In the end, Chan realised that his position was hopeless. He spread the word inside the Parliament that if members supported him, he would resign anyway. The Parliament voted against the motion.

The crowd outside, upon hearing of the news, began to riot. They had not heard that Chan planned to resign anyway. The police advised parliamentarians to remain inside the Parliament, as they could not be safely evacuated. Chan and Haiveta had to be disguised and then raced out in a police car. All through the night, the standoff continued, with the parliamentarians fearing that they would be arrested. Though many soldiers continued to demand to move in on the building, Enuma resisted his soldiers, and convinced them to remain in their positions. He also addressed the Parliament, assuring them that there was not going to be a military coup. Enuma attempted to order the soldiers back to barracks and the crowds to disperse, but they remained until Parliament began sitting again the following morning. That morning, Chan sacked both Ijape and Haiveta then resigned himself.

Bill Skate, who had moved the motion against Chan, replaced him as Prime Minister on 22 July after a Federal election, (Giheno took on the acting PM role up until 2 June, where Chan was again raised to the PM for his last six weeks of term). Under Skate, the peace process continued, and within a year after the Sandline affair, a treaty was in place, which , remains intact. 

A number of inquiries into the affair followed. Jerry Singirok was reappointed to his previous position as head of the PNGDF in 1998, but was dismissed again in 2000 over charges stemming from the incident. However, in April 2004, Singirok was formally acquitted of all charges laid against him over the events of February and March 1997, notwithstanding that he had been found to have received illicit payments from J&amp;S Franklyn, a UK arms dealer, paid into a secret account at Lloyds Bank in the UK, as first reported by Mary-Louise O’Callaghan in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper.

Chan was later acquitted on corruption charges relating to the Sandline affair.

The John Day Lock has the highest lift (at ) of any U.S. lock. The reservoir impounded by the dam is Lake Umatilla, and it runs up the river channel to the foot of the McNary Dam. John Day Dam is part of the Columbia River Basin system of dams.

== Location ==
John Day Dam is located east of the city of The Dalles, Oregon, and just below the mouth of the John Day River. The closest town on the Washington side is Goldendale, north. The closest town on the Oregon side is Rufus. The dam&#x27;s crest elevation is approximately above sea level. It joins Sherman County, Oregon with Klickitat County, Washington, upriver from the mouth of the Columbia near Astoria, Oregon.

== History ==
Construction of the dam began in 1958 and was completed in 1971, making it the newest dam on the lower Columbia, at a total cost of US$511 million. The pool was filled in 1968 and a dedication ceremony was held on September 28, 1968. John Day Dam was built and is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The condemnation of land upstream of the dam led to the Supreme Court case &quot;United States v. Rands&quot;, a well-known case regarding the constitutional doctrine of navigable servitude. The dam&#x27;s power generation capacity is 2,480,000 kW (overload capacity). 
Skeleton units for eventual installation of four additional generators were fitted to the powerhouse during construction, allowing for a 20% increase in output should the decision be taken to complete them.
The dam underwent a major repair to the upper lock gate in 2010, as documented in an episode of the National Geographic Channel program &quot;World&#x27;s Toughest Fixes&quot;.

As of 2007, the 76-mile-long reservoir formed the deadliest stretch of the Columbia River for migrating young salmon. The reservoir is the longest lake on the Columbia that young salmon must swim on their way to the ocean.

<text>This is a list of [[mayor]]s of [[Rio de Janeiro]].

==History==

The city of Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565. It was the seat of the Crown captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a district of colonial Brazil under Portuguese rule. In 1763 Rio de Janeiro city became the capital of the colony, then named &quot;State of Brazil&quot;. In 1815 Brazil became a kingdom within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves; the captaincy of Rio de Janeiro became the province of Rio de Janeiro, within the Kingdom of Brazil, and the city of Rio de Janeiro continued to be the capital of both the Kingdom and the Province. Also, the Portuguese Court had moved to Rio in 1808, so that, even before the creation of the United Kingdom, the city was the de facto capital of the whole Portuguese Empire. In 1821 the Royal Court returned to Portugal, and in 1822 Brazil proclaimed its independence, with the establishment of the Empire of Brazil. The city of Rio de Janeiro was the Empire&#x27;s capital, and, until 1834, it also remained the capital of the Province of Rio de Janeiro.

Not only in the case of Rio, but for all Brazilian cities, the office of mayor, separate from the city council, only came into existence after Brazil became a Republic in 1889. In the pre-independence era (comprising both the colonial and the United Kingdom periods), the city council discharged both Executive, as well as limited Legislative and Judicial functions. After independence, city councils lost its Judicial powers with the establishment of an independent Judicial Branch distinct from the political Branches of the State, but, during the Empire of Brazil era (1822–1889), city councils remained invested with limited legislative powers (the enactment of &quot;municipal postures&quot;, in Portuguese &quot;posturas municipais&quot;), as well as with Executive functions, with no office of mayor.

During the colonial period, the city councils of the major cities, such as Rio, were referred to as the &quot;Senado da Câmara&quot;. Also, during the pre-independence period, the presiding officer of the most important city councils was a royal magistrate (known as the &quot;Juiz de Fora&quot;, literally &quot;Outside Judge&quot;) appointed by the King or by other royal functionaries (colonial governors, etc.), to lead the city council. After the Independence of Brazil, the office of &quot;Juiz de Fora&quot; was abolished, city councils ceased to have a judicial role; after Independence, in the Empire of Brazil era, all Brazilian city councils were led by a president, who was the councilman with the most votes in the elections for the council. The composition, structure and powers of Rio&#x27;s city council, and of all the city and village councils of Brazil, was reformed in 1828, with the adoption of the Organic Law of the Municipal Councils (Imperial Law of 1 October 1828). In the case of Rio, the newly constituted city council (no longer titled &quot;Senado da Câmara&quot;, but instead named &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;, began to operate in 1830.

Until 1834, although it was the Nation&#x27;s Capital, Rio was administered just like any other Brazilian city: it was part of a Province, and its municipal government was discharged by a local council, with no mayor, and with the council&#x27;s presiding officer (first the Outside Judges in the pre-independence period, then the council presidents in the era of the independent Empire), leading the council&#x27;s affairs. However, until 1834, unlike other Provinces, that were led by a president appointed by the imperial government, alongside an elected provincial general council, the Province of Rio de Janeiro, because it contained the Empire&#x27;s capital, had no president or general council, instead being administered directly by the imperial government, under the authority of the Minister and Secretary of State for the Affairs of the Empire (&quot;Ministro e Secretário de Estado para os Negócios do Império&quot;), the country&#x27;s Justice and Interior minister.

However, in 1834, an amendment to the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil (the 1834 Additional Act), among other provisions, set the city of Rio de Janeiro, as the country&#x27;s capital, apart from the Nation&#x27;s provinces. The seat of the province of Rio de Janeiro was moved to the city of Niterói, and the city of Rio de Janeiro was included in a &quot;Neutral Municipality&quot; (in Portuguese, &quot;Município Neutro&quot;), belonging to no province, and answering directly to the imperial government. The 1834 Additional Act also replaced provincial general councils with more powerful provincial legislative assemblies. Along with separating the Empire&#x27;s capital (the city of Rio de Janeiro) from the Province of Rio de Janeiro, the 1934 Additional Act put an end to the direct administration of the Province of Rio de Janeiro by the Imperial Government under the responsibility of the Minister for the Empire. Thus, from 1834 onwards, the Province of Rio de Janeiro, with its capital in Niterói, was governed under the same system that applied to the other Provinces of the Empire: the Executive authority was vested in a province president, appointed by the emperor, who served alongside an elected Provincial Legislative Assembly. After this 1834 reform, however, the Province of Rio de Janeiro had no jurisdiction over the city of Rio de Janeiro, that was a separate political entity as the Neutral Municipality, not belonging to any Province. Within the Neutral Municipality, the imperial government, in addition to discharging the competences of the central government, directly discharged, with regard to the city of Rio de Janeiro, the competences that were proper to provincial governments. Nevertheless, in the Neutral Municipality, Municipal functions continued under the authority of the city council (&quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;), and, after the 1834 Additional Act, the city council remained constituted as before: led by its president, and with no separate office of mayor, the president of the city council being the councilman elected with most votes in the local elections. The powers and duties of the municipal authorities of the Neutral Municipality were the same of the municipal authorities of all other Brazilian municipalities, and the election, composition and powers of the city council continued to be regulated by the 1828 Organic Law of the Municipal Councils. However, as a result of the 1834 reform, since it was no longer part of any province, the city of Rio de Janeiro gained direct representation in the Imperial Parliament: the people of Neutral Municipality were represented in the General Assembly (the Empire&#x27;s Parliament) by a delegation of senators and members of the Chamber of Deputies, elected as if the Neutral Municipality were a province.

In 1889 the Empire of Brazil was abolished by a military coup d&#x27;état, and replaced with a Federal Republic. Brazil&#x27;s provinces became States, and the &quot;Neutral Municipality&quot; became the &quot;Federal District&quot; (&quot;Distrito Federal&quot; in Portuguese), with the city of Rio de Janeiro continuing to be the Nation&#x27;s capital. The old Province of Rio de Janeiro became the State of Rio de Janeiro (retaining Niterói as its capital), and it continued to be an entity completely separate from the city of Rio de Janeiro. While in the imperial era the central government retained the provincial-level functions and the Neutral Municipality discharged only municipal functions, in the new Federal Republic, the Federal District discharged all municipal competences and most competences of a state, except as otherwise provided by the Federal Constitution or by Federal Laws; it elected senators and federal deputies as if it were a state.

However, the Federal Government of the newly created Republic assumed the power of appointing the city&#x27;s executive leaders, and the power to elect the municipal executive of the Republic&#x27;s capital was only given to the people decades after the capital of Brazil had been transferred from Rio to Brasília, while in the imperial period the leadership of the municipality was elected by popular vote. Rio was the capital of republican Brazil from the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889 until 1960. During the period of the Provisional Government (1889–1891), when the institutional framework of the new republican Federation was still being created, the elected city council (&quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;) was dissolved, and the Federal District was transitionally administered by a council of unelected &quot;Intendentes Municipais&quot;, appointed by the Federal Provisional Government. Francisco Antonio Pessoa de Barros was the first president of that council of &quot;Intendentes&quot;. The Council of Intendentes discharged both executive and legislative functions. In 1891, that temporary arrangement ceased, the Council of Intendentes was abolished, and the permanent structures of the government of the Federal District were created, with the recreation the city council, resuming the old name of &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;, and with the establishment of the separate executive office of the mayor of the Federal District. Thus the city council (&quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;), elected by the city&#x27;s people, resumed its role as the local body of lawmaking and oversight, but it lost its executive powers, and a separate executive office of mayor was created for the Federal District. From then on, therefore, the presidents of the council became mere presiding officers of a legislative chamber, and administrative functions were transferred from the council and its president to the mayor of the Federal District (in Portuguese, &quot;Prefeito do Distrito Federal&quot;, literally meaning Prefect of the Federal District). While the several States elected its Governments, the mayors of the Federal District during that period were appointed by the president of the Republic, and thus answered to the Federal Government. Accordingly, all mayors of the Federal District during the period when Rio de Janeiro was the capital of the Republic (1889–1960) were presidential appointees. The presidential appointment of the mayor required confirmation by the Brazilian Federal Senate. Barata Ribeiro took office as the first mayor of the Federal District in 1892.

From 1937 to 1946, during the Estado Novo dictatorship of President Getúlio Vargas, the city council of the Federal District was dissolved (on a theoretically provisional basis, pending elections that, however, were never held until the overthrowal of the dictator), and, during that period, and a Federal Interventor governed the Federal District, discharging both the executive functions of the office of mayor and the legislative functions of the dissolved city council. Henrique Dodsworth was the Federal Interventor during the whole period of the Estado Novo regime. When Vargas was deposed, Dodsworth was removed as Interventor by transitional administration of President José Linhares, and, appointed by Linhares, Filadelfo de Azevedo served as the second and last Federal Interventor, pending elections for a National Constituent Assembly and for the city council of the Federal District. In 1946, after the deposition of the dictatorship and the restoration of democratic freedoms in Brazil, the Federal Intervention ceased, and the separate institutions of the mayor and the city council were reestablished, following the same pattern that existed before 1937: the executive mayor was nominated by the president of the Republic and appointed after approval by the Federal Senate, and legislative powers within the Federal District were vested in the directly elected city council. Appointed by President Eurico Gaspar Dutra, Hildebrando de Araújo Góis became the first mayor of the Federal District after the termination of the Intervention on 2 February 1946.

On 21 April 1960, the city of Rio lost its status as the country&#x27;s capital: the capital of Brazil was transferred to the newly built city of Brasília, and that city thus became the seat of the new Federal District. On that day, the old Federal District became a new State within the Brazilian Federal Republic, under the name of &quot;State of Guanabara&quot;. Because it was made up of a single city (the city of Rio de Janeiro), the State of Guanabara was the only State in Brazil not divided into municipalities. Therefore, Guanabara was a state, and its State Government discharged both state and municipal competences. The first governor of Guanabara, José Sette Câmara Filho, was appointed on an interim capacity by the president of the Republic, after his nomination was approved by the Brazilian Federal Senate, to lead a provisional Administration until the State could organize itself and elect its officers. Sette Camara took office on the same date the new State came into being, but in December 1960 Carlos Lacerda was sworn-in as the first elected governor of the newly constituted State of Guanabara, serving alongside the State Legislative Assembly. Lacerda thus became the first leader directly elected by the people of Rio to govern the city in a purely Executive office held by a single person and separate from the city council (or its successor State Legislative Assembly).

Under Brazil&#x27;s 1946 Constitution, state governors were elected by direct popular ballot (as they are nowadays) but, during the 1964–1985 military dictatorship, indirect elections for governor were implemented from 1970 onwards, and governors were elected by the State Legislative Assemblies during the 1970s. As part of the process of transition to democracy, popular elections for state governors were reinstated from 1982 onwards. Accordingly, in the 1960 and 1965 elections, the governors of the State of Guanabara were chosen by popular vote, and in the 1970 election the governor was chosen by the state assembly.

In 1975, during Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship, the Federal Government decided to abolish the State of Guanabara by forcing it to merge with the State of Rio de Janeiro. This was possible only due to the exceptionally centralizing constitutional legislation that governed Brazil during the 1964–1985 military regime: the merger was implemented by federal statute, without any vote of the populations affected and without any consultation with the state assemblies involved. Juridically, a new state was born out of the merger of the two preceding ones, although this new State was also named &quot;State of Rio de Janeiro&quot;, and in spite of the fact that the Constituent Assembly of the new State later decided to keep the same flag that had been used by the old State of Rio de Janeiro. The city of Rio de Janeiro (formerly the seat of the State of Guanabara), became the capital of the new State of Rio de Janeiro. With the abolition of the old State of Rio de Janeiro, the city of Niterói ceased to be a State capital. The merger was implemented on 15 March 1975. From then on, therefore, the city of Rio de Janeiro ceased to be included in the State of Guanabara and the position of governor of Guanabara ceased to exist.

While the new State of Rio de Janeiro assumed the state-level powers and state duties of the former state of Guanabara, a new political entity was created at the local level as a result of the merger of the two States: the &quot;Municipality of Rio de Janeiro&quot; (&quot;Município do Rio de Janeiro&quot;), the legal entity that governs the city at the municipal level and that assumed the municipal-level powers and duties that previously had been discharged by the state of Guanabara jointly with state-level functions.

Therefore, after the 1975 merger between the old State of Rio de Janeiro and the State of Guanabara, with the creation of the new State of Rio de Janeiro and of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, the city of Rio became for the first time since 1834 a normal Brazilian city, with an ordinary municipal administration like other cities: it is constituted as a municipality that forms part of a State, that in turn forms part of the Nation; indeed, with the 1975 merger of States, for the first time since 1834, the city of Rio de Janeiro became once again a part of the surrounding Rio de Janeiro Province or State (and its Capital city). From then on, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, a city council (&quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;) discharges the municipal Legislative authority, while Executive functions of the Municipality are vested in the separate office of mayor (&quot;Prefeito&quot;, literally Prefect). The Executive Branch of the city&#x27;s government is called &quot;Municipal Prefecture&quot; (&quot;Prefeitura Municipal&quot;).

Until the termination of Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship in 1985, mayors of the City of Rio de Janeiro (as well as the mayors of the other Brazilian state capitals) were appointed by the state governor. In March 1975 Marcos Tamoio became the first mayor of Rio de Janeiro as a Municipality of the State of Rio de Janeiro, by appointment of the new state&#x27;s first governor, Floriano Faria Lima.

Since 1985 the mayors of Rio de Janeiro – as well as the mayors of all other Brazilian municipalities, including state capitals – are elected by the people, by direct universal suffrage. In 1985 Saturnino Braga became the city&#x27;s first directly elected chief executive since the 1965 election for Governor of Guanabara, and Rio&#x27;s first directly elected mayor. Since the adoption of a Federal Constitutional Amendment in 1997, mayors can stand for reelection, for one consecutive term.

<text>Cottles Bridge is a town in Victoria, Australia, 30 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Cottles Bridge recorded a population of 609 at the 2021 census.

==History==

The area, previously known as Back Creek, was named after Thomas Cottle, who settled in the area in the 1870s. Cottle&#x27;s Bridge Post Office opened on 1 January 1910 and closed in 1960.

The actual Cottles Bridge is located west of St. Andrews in a location that was once full of small farms and orchards

From the 1950s onwards, various artists settled in the area, most notably Clifton Pugh AO, who established the Dunmoochin Artists Society there in 1953.

==Present day==

Cottles Bridge is home to the Lovegrove Vineyard and Winery, an award-winning Yarra Valley winery which established in 1983 and produces sparkling wines, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, cabernet and merlot.

<doc id="737498" wikidata="Q5270756" url="?curid=737498" title="Diamond Creek, Victoria">
<text>Diamond Creek is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 23 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Diamond Creek recorded a population of 12,503 at the 2021 census.

== History ==
There are two ideas about where Diamond Creek got its name. Victoria&#x27;s Register of Geographic Names says that it was because of the way the stones glistened in the creek water. Local legend says it is because of a bull who was trying to cross a creek. The bull had a diamond shaped white patch on its head and found difficulty crossing the creek. Thus the Bullocky named the town after the bull with the diamond shape on its head and the creek it drowned in.

The Ellis family were pioneers of the District and benefactors of the Nillumbik cemetery gateway. Ellis Cottage, a rubble-stone hipped roof cottage contains its original fabric and is considered historically significant and is on the Victorian Heritage database.

Gold was first discovered in Diamond Creek in 1863 by Messrs Peers, Haley and Wilson. The Diamond Creek mine was opened some years after gold was first discovered and dug 700 feet vertical and 300 feet underlay. The value of gold taken from the mine was reported to be between £1,000,000 and £2,000,000 Australian at the time.

In 1867, the Nillumbik cemetery at Diamond Creek was established. It occupies an area of two acres between Main and Edinburgh Streets and is positioned on high ground above Sawpit Creek and the Diamond Creek floodplain. It is laid out in a grid formation. A brick and rendered archway was built in 1897. The cemetery is considered significant and is listed on the Victorian heritage database.

From 1894–1969 there were a number of bushfires. In 1894, houses and stock were destroyed.

In the postwar years, population increased dramatically in Diamond Creek and its neighbouring areas. The Diamond Valley Shire was created out of the northern part of the Shire of Heidelberg in 1964. Further population growth occurred throughout the 1970s. The early 20th century saw a decline in the orchard industry, as orchards in Melbourne&#x27;s eastern townships such as Doncaster and Nunawading, fell into favour due to better marketing. Diamond Creek remained relatively untouched during the boom in recreational travel that followed the popularity of the motor car. 

Diamond Creek was home to a Donkey Shelter from 1997 to 2012, which provided accommodation and care for neglected donkeys from around the state of Victoria. In 2012, this moved to Tongala.

==Geography==

The Diamond Creek Shopping Centre and railway station are located on the banks of Diamond Creek, and the Hurstbridge railway line follows the course of Diamond Creek northwards from Eltham to its terminus at Hurstbridge.

==Schools==

Schools in Diamond Creek include Diamond Valley College, Plenty Valley International Montessori School, Sacred Heart Primary School, Diamond Creek Primary School, Diamond Creek East Primary School. The Diamond Creek East Primary School opened in 1970.

==Facilities==

The St John&#x27;s Anglican church complex in Main Street includes a Sunday school and parish hall. The church is amongst the oldest buildings in the Shire of Nillumbik, built about 1867. It has three stained glass windows. The complex is considered significant and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

On the other side of St John&#x27;s is Ashton Manor, previously known as The Abbey. It was a reception centre and very popular for weddings and other celebrations. It is now the location for Tobin Brothers Funerals.

Nillumbik Historical Society was formed in 1973 and is situated in the Ellis Cottage historical precinct.

The Diamond Creek Community Centre is jointly administered by the Shire of Nillumbik and the YMCA, and provides a venue for basketball, gymnasium and group fitness classes, child care, community classes and public and private functions. The centre also houses Nillumbik&#x27;s Maternal and Child Health Service. The Community Centre served as an evacuation point, providing emergency accommodation, first aid and government relief to local residents affected by the February 2009 Victorian bushfires. Diamond Creek has two football clubs, Diamond Creek Football Club and Diamond Creek Women&#x27;s football club playing in the Northern Football League.

The Rotary Club of Diamond Creek organise the annual Diamond Creek Town Fair, a community event held in September. It commences with a parade which features local schools, scouting groups, child care centres and community groups. The fair offers food, crafts and fairground attractions, rides, wood chopping, local community stallholders, and entertainment. It traditionally concludes with an evening torchlight parade by the local CFA units and a fireworks display.

Diamond Creek Little Athletics Club is one of the eight clubs competing weekly at the Diamond Valley Little Athletics Centre at Willinda Park Greensborough.

Diamond Creek also has a busy CFA (Country Fire Authority) volunteer fire brigade, which attends to over 230 emergency calls annually. The brigade was established in 1942. In 2005, a new emergency services centre was built on the Main Hurstbridge Rd, which includes CFA, Metropolitan Ambulance Service and Police facilities. The Diamond Creek CFA brigade has approximately 60 members, one pumper, two tankers, a slip on ute and a Toyota Hilux FCV, as well as an extensive collection of modern, advanced firefighting equipment and training facilities.

Diamond Creek is serviced by the Diamond Valley Division of St John Ambulance Australia (Victoria). St John Ambulance provides emergency pre-hospital care to local events in Diamond Creek, such as the Town Fair, Pet Expo, Fun Runs and many other local events. The Diamond Valley division is based in Greensborough.

In 1981, an opportunity shop opened to raise funds for the Austin Hospital in Heidelberg. It raised over $2 million in its 30-year operation until its closure in 2011 when the building was deemed unsafe. In February 2013, the shop re-opened after a benefactor donated funds for the hospital to meet the cost of the renovations.

The Diamond Creek OM:NI discussion group was formed in 2010. They meet at the Diamond Creek Netball Club

A new dedicated ambulance home base was opened in April 2019. Paramedics were previously housed in the emergency services complex with police and firefighters. The branch features a spacious garage for vehicles, rest and recline areas, a training room and kitchen, The branch provides 24-hour emergency care.

A Tram Cafe opened in October 2020. This is a fully refurbished W Class Melbourne tram acquired from the Victorian State Government after a successful application by the Rotary Club of Diamond Creek, Diamond Creek CFA, Diamond Creek Men&#x27;s Shed and Nillumbik Shire Council. The cafe features a large deck and pergola and state of the art playground. Araluen, a disability support service in Diamond Creek, run the cafe three days a week.

Diamond Creek is serviced by Yarra Plenty Regional Library&#x27;s Mobile Library.

<text>Hurstbridge is a suburb in Melbourne, Australia, 28 km north-east of the Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Hurstbridge recorded a population of 3,554 at the 2021 census.

Hurstbridge lies between Wattle Glen to the south, Arthur&#x27;s Creek to the north, and Panton Hill to the east.

==History==
Before colonisation, the land around Hurstbridge was occupied by the Wurundjeri-Willam clan, an Aboriginal Australian people of the Woiwurrung language group. The Wurundjeri-Willam clan were part of the larger Kulin alliance.
Hurstbridge was first settled by colonists in 1842 by Cornelius Haley, a grazier. The area was originally known as Upper Diamond Creek, or Allwood, after the homestead built there on Haley&#x27;s selection. The town was renamed in 1924. The town&#x27;s current name is from the Hurst family. Henry Hurst worked for Haley, and in 1857 was joined by his father Robert, mother, and siblings. The Hursts took over from Haley and built the first log bridge across the Diamond Creek, upstream from the present Monash Bridge, in 1858. In 1866, Henry Hurst was fatally wounded by a bushranger, Robert Bourke. The latter was captured and tied to a wheel of a wagon under a tree (now known as Bourke&#x27;s Tree) until troopers from nearby St Andrews (formerly Queenstown) arrived. Bourke was tried and found guilty of the murder and was later hanged.

For many years the area was characterised by orchards and nurseries, and in 1912 a railway line was extended to Hurstbridge to transport fruit to Melbourne. As a result of this rail connection, a settlement started developing near the bridge. A post office was opened in 1912 and the current single-lane bridge, designed by Sir John Monash, was completed in 1918. The township was originally known as Hurst&#x27;s Bridge until 1915, and then as Hurst Bridge until about 1954. Further development of the town occurred in the Post-War years, and electricity was connected in 1957.

The artist Albert Tucker moved to a property in Hurstbridge in the 1960s, where he lived for many years. A series of paintings from the time depict the natural bushland around his property.

==Today==
The area is home to a diverse mix of families, artists, musicians and people looking for a balance between city and country. The suburb services local residents and visitors from 60+ small businesses and artisan shops. A number of surrounding attractions include wineries, walking tracks, farmers&#x27; markets, and local artists&#x27; markets.

In 2022, the Diamond Creek Trail extension to Hurstbridge was completed. The extension makes a continuous trail from Hurstbridge to the CBD via the Yarra River Trail.

Hurstbridge&#x27;s most iconic event is the annual Hurstbridge Wattle 
Festival. The festival is held on the last Sunday in August and is a significant cultural event that has its roots firmly planted in the early railway history of the area. Festival goers are able to view the wattles in a blaze of glory along the Diamond Creek as they approach the area.

<doc id="737517" wikidata="Q64228" url="?curid=737517" title="Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal">
<text>Ehrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, &quot;suo jure&quot; Duchess of Kendal, &quot;suo jure&quot; Duchess of Munster (25 December 166710 May 1743) was a longtime mistress to King George I of Great Britain.

==Early life==
She was born at Emden in the Duchy of Magdeburg. She was a daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, Baron von der Schulenburg, Privy Councillor to the Elector of Brandenburg, by his wife Petronella Ottilie von Schwencken. Her brothers were Marshal Johann Matthias Imperial Count (&quot;Reichsgraf&quot;) von der Schulenburg and General Daniel Bodo Count von der Schulenburg and her sisters were Margarethe &quot;Gertrud&quot; von der Schulenburg (married to kinsman Friedrich Achaz von der Schulenburg und Hehlen), Sophia Juliane von der Schulenburg (married to Rabe Christoph von Oeynhausen), and Anna Elisabeth von der Schulenburg (married to Georg Friedrich von Spörcken). Her middle name was probably given in reference to the Melusine legends.

==Royal mistress==

Once a Maid of Honour to Electress Sophia, she became a mistress of the Electoral Prince, George Louis. George Louis succeeded as Elector of Hanover in 1698 and King of Great Britain (as George I) in 1714.

Melusine moved with him to England, and on 18 July 1716 was created for life Duchess of Munster, Marchioness of Dungannon, Countess of Dungannon and Baroness Dundalk, in the Peerage of Ireland. On 19 March 1719 she was further created Duchess of Kendal, Countess of Feversham and Baroness Glastonbury, in the Peerage of Great Britain. In 1723 Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, created her Princess of Eberstein. This last creation in particular tended to support the theory that she had married the King in secret. Robert Walpole said of her that she was &quot;as much the queen of England as anyone was&quot;. George&#x27;s wife Sophia had been kept in imprisonment since their divorce in 1694.

The Duchess of Kendal was a very thin woman, being known in Germany as &quot;the Scarecrow&quot; () and in England as &quot;the Maypole&quot;. The Jacobites called her &quot;the Goose&quot;, most famously in the taunting Scots ballad &quot;Cam Ye O&#x27;er Frae France&quot;. When in England, she lived principally at Kendal House in Isleworth, Middlesex. She obtained large sums of money by selling public offices and titles; she also sold patent rights, including the privilege of supplying Ireland with a new copper coinage. This she sold to William Wood, a Wolverhampton merchant, who flooded the country with inferior coins, leading Jonathan Swift to write his &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot;. In political matters, she had much influence with the king, and she received £10,000 (£ in ) for procuring the recall of Viscount Bolingbroke from exile.

Melusine bore George three illegitimate children:
*Anna Luise Sophie von der Schulenburg, Countess of Dölitz (1 January 1692– 2 November 1773), who married Ernest August Philipp von dem Bussche-Ippenburg.
*Petronilla &quot;Melusina&quot; von der Schulenburg (1 April 1693–16 September 1778), who married Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, a leading Whig politician.
* Margarethe Gertrud von Oeynhausen (10 January 1701–8 April 1726), who married Albrecht Wolfgang, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe.

Anna Luise Sophie and Petronilla Melusina were officially acknowledged as the children of Melusine&#x27;s sister Gertrud (1659–1697) and her husband Friedrich Achaz von der Schulenburg (1647–1701), a kinsman of the sisters who shared their surname. Margarethe Gertrud was officially named von Oeynhausen because she was recognised as the daughter of Melusine&#x27;s other sister, Sophia Juliane (1668–1755) and her husband Rabe Christoph von Oeynhausen (1655–1748).
==Later life and death==
After George&#x27;s death, she kept a raven she believed to be the dead king. She died, unmarried (unless George I had wedded her), on 10 May 1743.

<doc id="737521" wikidata="Q1723723" url="?curid=737521" title="Kangaroo Ground, Victoria">
<text>Kangaroo Ground is a town in Victoria, Australia, 26 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Kangaroo Ground recorded a population of 1,208 at the 2021 census.

There are two sources for the origin of the name. The name arises from the extraordinary richness of the locality with kangaroo grass before it was settled. It is a descriptive term, apparently coined by William Ryrie but first formally recorded in February 1838 by Robert Hoddle in his diary: &quot;Crossed a creek nearly dry and entered some forest land distant from Melbourne called Kangaroo Grounds... It abounds in kangaroos, hence its name.&quot;

==History==

An agricultural district, Kangaroo ground was considered one of the oldest and richest in the early History of Victoria, due to the extraordinary richness of its soil. It was on the road to the Woods Point gold diggings. The Kangaroo Ground Post Office opened on 4 October 1854. In the centre of the district stands a high knoll, known as Garden Hill occupied by Kangaroo Ground War Memorial Park. In 1874 views could be seen of the Kew Asylum and ships coming up Hobson&#x27;s Bay. The earliest settler in the area was Mr Donaldson who purchased land when it part of New South Wales holdings.

Kangaroo ground got its name when over 200 kangaroos were spotted.

Kangaroo Ground is one of the earliest settled areas of the Shire of Nillumbik. At one time it rivalled Eltham as the major centre of the former Shire of Eltham.&quot;Kangaroo Ground General Store&quot; /&gt; A sugar gum tree on a road reserve in the centre of the township is an especially large specimen and is considered significant as a rare example of this species of eucalyptus commonly planted elsewhere in the early 1900s. Similarly a very mature remnant manna gum of the former indigenous landscape is a local landmark tree of significant size and age and considered significant.

In 1878 while on a trip to England, John Donaldson visited Windsor Great Park where he collected some acorns. He returned to Kangaroo Ground and planted them on his property &quot;Kangaroo Hall.&quot; The quercus robur or oak tree was estimated to be 110 years old in 2004.

In 1878 the Presbyterian Church was constructed of polychrome brick and is attributed to the architect C. W. Maplestone. In 1892 a weatherboard vestry was added at the rear of the church. It is considered historically, architecturally, aesthetically, socially and spiritually significant to the Shire of Nillumbik.

The &quot;Pigeon Bank&quot; residence and garden commenced in the 1860s includes mature exotic site plantings and is considered historically and aesthetically significant to the Shire of Nillumbik. The house is associated with Francis Rogerson, an early pioneer, and politician Ewan Cameron who lived at the property from 1874 until 1915. Cameron farmed one hundred acres or forty hectares on this property. He married Agnes Bell, daughter of John Bell, a farmer also of Kangaroo Ground. They had eight sons and three daughters. Cameron died at Kangaroo Ground on 27 September 1915.

Hawthorn hedges (or crateaegus monogyna) were planted about 1860s to the 1870s in the area, reflecting the adoption of European farming techniques by European settlers. Some hedges remain and are considered historically and aesthetically significant to the Shire of Nillumbik.

The Wippell Farm complex consists of a surviving timber slab farm building representative of the complex Victorian and Edwardian-era farming at Kangaroo Ground. Rare mature planting remains on the site which is considered significant to the Nillumbik Shire and are listed on the Victorian Heritage Database. 

The nineteenth century &quot;Garden Hill&quot; weatherboard house and its associated shearing shed are historically and aesthetically significant to the Shire of Nillumbik. It was modest accommodation for local pioneer Andrew Harkness. The house is also historically significant for its association with industrialist and philanthropist Sir Henry Gepp and his association with a Canary Island palm on the property. The home is near the Kangaroo Ground War Memorial Park and affords a view extending to Kinglake.

A building which accommodated the Evelyn Observer newspaper was built on top of a local hill about 1874. After the transfer of the newspaper to an office in Hurstbridge, Eltham Shire Council purchased the property. It was subsequently used as the building for the Eltham Shire Offices. It was destroyed in a fire in 1934.

In 1892 the Kangaroo Ground Fire Brigade was formed. Members have fought in a number of fires including the Black Saturday bushfires. In 1980 a new station was built. It has been extended a number of times since. In 2017 it had about 70 members.

In 1964 local families established the Kangaroo Ground Pony Club. In 1988 land was purchased which was developed into an equestrian facility of six arenas, a mount rig, a cross country course, sheds and clubhouse. Kangaroo Ground Adult Riders also ride on these grounds.

==Facilities==
A school has operated in the district since 1851. The first school master was Andrew Ross. His diaries of that time have been published. The School was established circa 1878 with a school room to the west established circa 1887. The School includes a residence built circa 1879 with a small room built on the front verandah of the residence in the 1920s. This served as a State Savings bank agency until 1934. A bathroom and rear porch were built about 1937. The School and residence are considered historically, socially and aesthetically significant to the Shire of Nillumbik and are on the Victorian Heritage Database. The residence was used by the Eltham District Historical Society and subsequently by the Andrew Ross Museum. The house is used for displays and houses a collection which focuses on the first schoolmaster Andrew Ross and the region&#x27;s farming history

Kangaroo Ground Pre-School operates on the same site as the Kangaroo Ground Primary School. The General Store and Post Office has a long association with Kangaroo Ground and has been an important centre of community life since about 1900. Shire of Eltham council meetings used to be conducted in the front room of the store. The store is considered socially and historically significant and is on the Victorian Heritage Database.

Its post office is reputed to be the only one in Australia which is also a winery. Winemaker Ken King integrated the post office into his winery.

The Kangaroo Ground Emergency Operations Centre was constructed in 1988 of mudbrick, a version of the &quot;Eltham style&quot; and features a central entry with a tile mural. It is considered architecturally, aesthetically, socially and historically significant to the Shire of Nillumbik and is registered on the Victorian Heritage Database.

Weller&#x27;s Hotel was built in 1872 and is considered historically significant to the Shire of Nillumbik. It has served as a hotel, store and staging post for Cobb &amp; Co coaches bound for the goldfields. The restaurant is now known as Fondata 1872.

The first burial at the Kangaroo Ground cemetery was a child Judith Furphy, who died 17 May 1851. Early pioneering families represented in the cemetery include Armstrong, Barr, Bell, Harkness, Jardine, Johnston, Rogerson, Stevenson, Thomson and Walters. Others buried there include feminist and journalist Irene Frances Taylor.

Kangaroo Ground is the Australian headquarters for Wycliffe Australia, part of the Wycliffe Global Alliance. Volunteer translators work to translate the Bible. In 1967 donated land and money was raised to develop a national centre. Mudbrick architect Alistair Knox designed the centre at no charge. Volunteers made mudbricks and planted thousands of native plants on the property of 11 hectares.

A mobile library operated by Yarra Plenty Regional Library regularly visits the township.

<doc id="737532" wikidata="Q7784824" url="?curid=737532" title="Third Dáil">
<text>The Third Dáil was elected at the general election held on 16 June 1922. This election was required to be held under the Anglo-Irish Treaty signed on 6 December 1921. It first met on 9 September and until 6 December 1922, it was the Provisional Parliament or the Constituent Assembly of Southern Ireland. From 6 December 1922, it was the lower house (Dáil Éireann) of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State, until its dissolution on 9 August 1923.

==Article 17 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty==
Article 17 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty provided:
Article 17 therefore envisaged by way of &quot;provisional arrangement&quot; the creation of a provisional government. For the purposes of giving effect to Article 17, Section 1(2) of the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, provided:

* the British Government could by Orders in Council transfer powers to the Provisional Government of Ireland;
* the Parliament of Southern Ireland would be dissolved within four months from the passing of the Act; and
* elections would be held for &quot;the House of the Parliament&quot; to which the Provisional Government would be responsible. The Act did not give a name to that Parliament, but said that in matters within the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government (i.e. only certain matters concerning Southern Ireland), it would have power to make laws in like manner as the Parliament of the Irish Free State when constituted. This last-mentioned &quot;House of the Parliament&quot; is what is more commonly referred to as the Third Dáil.

==Election of the Third Dáil/Provisional Parliament==
The election to the Third Dáil took place on 16 June 1922. It occurred under the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. Unlike the Second Dáil, which included members from the whole island of Ireland, the Third Dáil did not include members elected from Northern Ireland. Since the largely uncontested election of the Second Dáil in 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty had been negotiated, and Sinn Féin—the only political party represented in the Dáil—had split into pro- and anti-Treaty factions; these two factions became the major contestants of the 1922 election, and other parties stood for the first time.

On 20 May Arthur Griffith read out to the Second Dáil the agreed pre-election Sinn Féin &quot;Pact&quot;, and also declared new elections for the constituencies of the former Southern Ireland, and this was agreed to unanimously. Griffith could not call elections in Northern Ireland because of the Treaty provision that: &quot;… no election shall be held for the return of members to serve in the Parliament of the Irish Free State for constituencies in Northern Ireland&quot;.

Despite the pact between the two Sinn Féin factions, the elections were seen by many as an endorsement of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and a draft of the proposed Constitution of the Irish Free State was published in the week before election as an example of the work under way. The pro-treaty side won a majority of seats; the anti-treaty faction boycotted the new assembly, refusing to recognise the body as the legitimate heir to the Second Dáil, and the Irish Civil War broke out shortly afterwards.

==Rival political theories==
The assembly was:
* the Third Dáil, the successor of the First Dáil (1919–1921) and the Second Dáil (1921–1922) according to Irish political theory; and
* the Provisional Parliament, the successor of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland (1921–1922) according to British political theory.

From both perspectives, it was a constituent assembly which created the constitution of the Irish Free State.

Ireland since 1919 had been governed under two rival political administrations. To nationalists and republicans, an assembly of Irish members of parliament (who adopted the equivalent Irish language term Teachta Dála or TD) had formed in Dublin in 1919 and was seen as the valid parliament of the Irish people, from which the Irish Republic received its sovereignty. Each Dáil in turn was the successor of the earlier one and the legitimate parliament of the Irish Republic. The Second Dáil had been chosen through an election in 1921 called by the British administration in Ireland, the elected republican members forming themselves into the Second Dáil rather than the Parliament of Southern Ireland they had been elected to. The Second Dáil agreed to the elections leading to the Third Dáil.

However, according to British political theory, the assembly of Irish MPs in Dublin did not constitute a valid parliament, and was subsequently declared illegal. In this view, legal government remained vested in His Majesty&#x27;s Government in Westminster, and its Irish executive, under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland based in Dublin Castle. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 created two Irish parliaments with effect from May 1921: one for Northern Ireland in Belfast and one for Southern Ireland, which was called to assemble in Royal College of Science in Dublin. The uncontested elections in Southern Ireland produced the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, though when the new house was called to assemble, only four MPs turned up. The remaining members assembled as TDs of the Second Dáil. Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Westminster parliament passed the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 which provided for dissolution of the Parliament of Southern Ireland and the election of a replacement parliament to which the Provisional Government would be responsible. The Act named this parliament as &quot;the House of the Parliament&quot;, perhaps to distinguish it from the Houses of parliament at Westminster.

==Two governments, two parliaments==
Under the Treaty, procedures were set in place to merge the republican and British systems. Initially both remained separate to validate the Treaty from their own perspectives. The Second Dáil and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland both voted separately to ratify the Treaty. Each house chose distinct and separate governments but which substantially overlapped in membership. Arthur Griffith was elected as President of Dáil Éireann on 10 January 1922 and formed a new Ministry of Dáil Éireann, while Michael Collins was appointed as Chairman of the Provisional Government on 16 January 1922 and formed the Provisional Government of Ireland. The Proclamation by the Provisional Government which called the body stated that it was made &quot;pursuant to the provisions of … an Act entitled the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922&quot;.

On 12 August, Arthur Griffith died of natural causes and on 22 August Michael Collins was assassinated. On 25 August, W. T. Cosgrave was appointed to succeed Collins as Chairman of the Provisional Government. He formed the 2nd Provisional Government on 30 August.

==First meeting of the Third Dáil==
The Third Dáil was first due to meet on 1 July. It was prorogued on five occasions, with its first meeting successively postponed to 15 July, to 29 July, to 12 August, to 16 August, and finally to 9 September. On this date, W. T. Cosgrave was appointed as President of Dáil Éireann. He formed the 5th Ministry of Dáil Éireann, with the same membership as the 2nd Provisional Government.

Whether the new house, the Third Dáil/Provisional Parliament, was a republican parliament or crown assembly was queried by some anti-Treaty Irish republicans. Laurence Ginnell turned up in the assembly to demand an answer as to which category, crown or republic, it belonged. The Ceann Comhairle read a message from Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Lord FitzAlan &quot;conveying to this Parliament his very best wishes&quot;, which suggests that both the Lord Lieutenant and the Ceann Comhairle considered this body one convened under the terms of the Treaty rather than Dáil of the Irish Republic.

==Enactment of the Constitution – two systems become one==
The Constitution of the Irish Free State provided, within its own articles, that it would not come into effect until it had been adopted by both the British Parliament and the Third Dáil, which it referred to as the &quot;constituent assembly&quot;. The Third Dáil adopted the Constitution of the Irish Free State on 25 October 1922. The document was then enacted by the British Parliament by the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922 and came into force on 6 December. The new constitution used the name &quot;Dáil Éireann&quot; for the house of representatives of a new parliament called the Oireachtas. However it provided that until the first elections to this new lower house the &quot;constituent assembly&quot; would exercise &quot;all the powers and authorities&quot; conferred on the &quot;new&quot; Dáil Éireann. The Third Dáil therefore functioned as a legislative lower house from December 1922 until it was dissolved on 9 August 1923 before the 1923 general election. The Fourth Dáil was convened on 19 September 1923. The numbering system of Dála begins with the First Dáil convened in January 1919.

<doc id="737534" wikidata="Q144104" url="?curid=737534" title="List of first overall NBA draft picks">
<text>The first overall pick in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is the player who is selected first among all eligible draftees by a team during the league&#x27;s annual draft. The first pick is awarded to the team that wins the NBA draft lottery; in most cases, that team had a losing record in the previous season. The NBA team that garners the top overall draft pick selection generates significant media attention, as does the respective player who eventually gets selected with that first pick.

Eleven first picks have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award: Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (record six-time winner), Bill Walton, Magic Johnson (three-time winner), Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan (two-time winner), LeBron James (four-time winner), and Derrick Rose (youngest winner).

China&#x27;s Yao Ming (2002), Italy&#x27;s Andrea Bargnani (2006), France&#x27;s Victor Wembanyama (2023) and Zaccharie Risacher (2024) are the only players without competitive experience in the United States to be drafted first overall. Eleven other international players with U.S. college experience have been drafted first overall—Mychal Thompson (Bahamas) in 1978, Olajuwon (Nigeria) in 1984, Patrick Ewing (Jamaica) in 1985, Duncan (U.S. Virgin Islands) in 1997, Michael Olowokandi (Nigeria) in 1998, Andrew Bogut (Australia) in 2005, Kyrie Irving (Australia) in 2011, Anthony Bennett (Canada) in 2013, Andrew Wiggins (Canada) in 2014, Ben Simmons (Australia) in 2016, and Deandre Ayton (Bahamas) in 2018. Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an &quot;international&quot; player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or the District of Columbia. Ewing had dual Jamaican-American citizenship when he was drafted, and Irving and Simmons had dual Australian-American citizenship when they were drafted.

Note that the drafts between 1947 and 1949 were held by the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The Basketball Association of America became the National Basketball Association after absorbing teams from the National Basketball League in the fall of 1949. Official NBA publications include the BAA Drafts as part of the NBA&#x27;s draft history.

<text>Panton Hill is a town in Victoria, Australia, 32 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Panton Hill recorded a population of 1,063 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Originally called Kingstown, the area experienced population growth in the mid-1850s during the Victorian gold rush when prospectors mined the hills around the town known as the Caledonia Goldfields.

It was named after Joseph Anderson Panton, who was the magistrate at Heidelberg and spent much of his spare time mapping the Yarra Valley.

Panton Hill Post Office opened on 1 October 1875.

The Panton Hill Primary School, number 1134, was originally a two (2) room building with the Headmasters residence beside it.

==Today==

The town has a hotel, general store/post office, an Australian rules football club called the Panton Hill Redbacks, competing in the Northern Football League and a cricket club in the Diamond Valley Cricket Association, with 4 senior teams and 4 junior teams. It is also home to a small church, St. Matthews Anglican Church,() and several wineries including Panton Hill Winery.

Panton Hill Primary School has an enrolment of approximately 150. The nearest high schools are Diamond Valley Secondary College and Eltham College. Panton Hill also has a volunteer Country Fire Brigade that services Panton Hill and the surrounding areas. A park in the centre of town has been dedicated to the memory of 5 of Panton Hill&#x27;s firefighters who perished on Ash Wednesday. Panton Hill Primary School&#x27;s houses are named after these firefighters.

A mobile library service operated by Yarra Plenty Regional Library regularly visits the township.

<text>Plenty is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Plenty recorded a population of 2,575 at the 2021 census.

Plenty is located within Greater Melbourne, beyond the Melbourne metropolitan area Urban Growth Boundary. It is a semi-rural area consisting mostly of large lots, with many being several acres in size. However, increasing urbanisation is evident near the border with the suburb of Greensborough. New housing estates are being established with the population in the area set to increase, however large areas of Plenty are still relatively untouched with development limited due to being in the green wedge.

==History==

Plenty Post Office opened on 3 August 1923 and closed in 1979. An earlier office opened in 1853 and was replaced by Whittlesea in 1864.

Plenty Primary School on Howell Road was closed in the 1990s under the Kennett Government.

Plenty Cricket Club was formed in 1946 and continues to play today.

The Plenty Historical Society was formed in 2001.

==Main features and attractions==
The main features of Plenty include the Greensborough Hockey Club and the Plenty War Memorial Park sports facilities, which is home to the Diamond Creek Women&#x27;s Football Club at 21 Memorial Drive. DCWFC is a female-only Australia Rules club, with players ranging from 7 to 70 years old.

The Plenty River makes up the border between Mill Park and Plenty. &quot;Blue Lake&quot; is located in Yellow Gum Recreation Area named for the beautiful colours of the water owing to the mineral contents. Yellow Gum Recreation Area is located in the Plenty Gorge Parklands and offers many natural and cultural experiences. A bushfire in Plenty Gorge Park occurred on 30 December 2019 and burnt approximately 65 hectares, the affected areas have now reopened. The area know known as Plenty Gorge Park has been seasonally visited by the Wurundjeri people for tens of thousands of years.

The Plenty Views Golf Park is also located on Yan Yean Rd.

Plenty Fire Station, a general store, and Plenty Hall are also within Plenty&#x27;s boundaries.

==Transport==
The main arterial running through Plenty is Yan Yean Road. Increased pressure is being placed on this road as it is used primarily by commuters travelling between the City and new estates in Doreen and surrounds, including Laurimar. Severe congestion is experienced during peak hours and it is often difficult to enter Plenty from Memorial Drive and River Avenue heading towards the City (traditional access routes). Throughout 2018 and 2019, Yan Yean Road was upgraded from a single-lane rural road into a two-lane divided Arterial Road, with traffic lights installed at Memorial Drive, River Avenue, and Browns Lane. This has greatly improved access for local residents of Plenty and improved congestion on Yan Yean Road.

Three metropolitan bus routes run along Yan Yean Rd. Since October 2010, SmartBus route 901 links Plenty with Melbourne Airport (T4), Broadmeadows, Epping, South Morang (Plenty Valley), Greensborough, Ringwood, and Frankston. It runs via Yan Yean Road, stopping at the Plenty Store/Plenty Fire Station every 15 minutes, much increasing the public transport connections in this area.

The nearest train stations are Diamond Creek or Greensborough, on the Hurstbridge line, and South Morang, on the Mernda line.

==Sport==
Plenty War Memorial Park is the main sports ground in Plenty. It is home to the Plenty Cricket Club, who play in the Diamond Valley Cricket Association. Plenty Park is also used for Australian Rules Football during winter by the Diamond Creek Women&#x27;s Football Club as their training and playing venue. Plenty Tennis Club play their home games at the Tennis courts at Plenty Park. Greensborough Hockey Club play their home games, senior and junior, at the Hockey Field at Plenty Park. Plenty Knights Basketball Club, who play in the Diamond Valley Basketball Association domestic competition, are based in Plenty.

<doc id="737566" wikidata="Q2047428" url="?curid=737566" title="Erstwhile Records">
<text>Erstwhile Records is an independent record label devoted to free improvisation, particularly the electroacoustic variety, contemporary, experimental composed music, and combinations of both. Erstwhile was founded by Jon Abbey in 1999, whose personality and tastes are closely identified with the label.

Characteristic label artists include guitarist Keith Rowe, percussionist Günter Müller, guitarist / turntablist Otomo Yoshihide, homemade electronics group Voice Crack, sine wave improviser Sachiko M, concrete artist Jason Lescalleet, guitarist / laptop composer Fennesz, guitarist Burkhard Stangl and synthesizer player Thomas Lehn, as well as younger musicians such as clarinetist Kai Fagaschinski. In recent years, also artists connected to the Wandelweiser group started releasing albums on the label, such as American composer Michael Pisaro.

==History==
The first few Erstwhile releases were something of a mixed set in terms of the music, ranging from the melancholy avant-blues of Loren Connors to the rather traditional free jazz of VHF. With the release of &quot;Tom and Gerry&quot;, however ― a double-disc duet between Lehn and drummer Gerry Hemingway ― the label&#x27;s focus notably shifted. It was the first album containing electroacoustic improvisation techniques which Erstwhile has become known for, as well as the first to feature meticulous post-production. The fifth Erstwhile release, &quot;World Turned Upside Down&quot;, featured a trio of guitarists Keith Rowe, Taku Sugimoto and percussionist Günter Müller. Rowe and Müller would both become fixtures of the label, and are a generation older than many of their younger collaborators. The album&#x27;s abstract, sparse sound resembles live releases by AMM and MIMEO, Rowe&#x27;s previous European improvisation groups.

Subsequent Erstwhile releases have largely focused on slow-moving, often quiet compositions played using non-standard computers and electronics (such as Sachiko M&#x27;s &quot;empty sampler&quot; or Toshimaru Nakamura&#x27;s &quot;no-input mixing board&quot;). These electronics often get paired with acoustic instruments, which are then played with amplification and extended techniques. The most prominent example of this modified instrumentation is Keith Rowe&#x27;s tabletop guitar, which he uses to create textured soundscapes by incorporating household objects and sampled radio transmissions through the instrument&#x27;s pickups. Another instance includes trumpeters Matt Davis and Axel Dörner, who sometimes play their instruments by blowing through the valves rather than the mouthpiece.

Releases like guitarist Martin Siewert and drummer Martin Brandlmayr&#x27;s &quot;Too Beautiful to Burn&quot; or laptop artist Christof Kurzmann and guitarist Burkhard Stangl&#x27;s &quot;Schnee&quot; maintain some elements of melody and accessibility, resembling other alternative genres such as post-rock or ambient music. Most Erstwhile albums however tend to showcase slow, quiet, unmoving textures of sound in a style similar to lowercase music. &quot;Good Morning Good Night&quot; by Sachiko M, Toshimaru Nakamura, and Otomo Yoshihide, for example, is 100 minutes of &quot;vertical music&quot; marked by piercing sine waves, bursts of static, feedback loops, and quiet vinyl crackle, demanding even for veteran listeners to avant-garde music.

The label&#x27;s aesthetic has yet to find an agreed-upon name, though many categorize the music as electroacoustic improvisation, or &quot;EAI.&quot; Some critics argue that Erstwhile and the term EAI have become almost synonymous, with NYC musician Jeremiah Cymerman regarding them as &quot;The Blue Note of lowercase music.&quot; &quot;Laminal music,&quot; &quot;granular music,&quot; &quot;reductionism,&quot; &quot;the new London silence,&quot; &quot;Onkyokei,&quot; &quot;Berlin minimalism,&quot; are additional terms which have been used to define the label.

The music packaging was the responsibility of designer Friederike Paetzold, whose works often entirely forgo details like artist&#x27;s names, instrumentation and album titles. Album covers tend to be characterized by stark, minimalist artwork, often painted by guitarist Keith Rowe, or Paetzold&#x27;s own photography. Critic John Eyles writes, &quot;Just as such labels as Blue Note, ECM, and Incus have captured and defined the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; at various points in the past, Erstwhile is now doing so. Like them, it has its own distinctive roster of players, its own sound and a distinctive visual style ... No need to see the label to know it’s on Erstwhile.&quot; Currently, most of the label&#x27;s designs are done by producer Yuko Zama.

Unusually, Erstwhile&#x27;s releases have been issued without UPCs.

==Associated festivals==
Abbey has also organized the Amplify Festival, an annual series of live free improvisation concerts. A box set of recordings from a 2002 festival held in Tokyo was released as &quot;AMPLIFY02: Balance&quot;, and featured some of the label&#x27;s flagship artists. The results of the 2004 event have been emerging as separate releases under the subsidiary label name ErstLive. In September 2005, Abbey put together a separate music festival in New York City, this time in collaboration with Tim Barnes&#x27; label Quakebasket and MoMA&#x27;s The Artist Project, called ErstQuake. In 2008, an edition of the Amplify Festival called AMPLIFY:light was held in Tokyo. In 2011 and 2013, the festival again took place in New York.

<doc id="737579" wikidata="Q2589426" url="?curid=737579" title="Warlords (1980 video game)">
<text>Warlords is an arcade video game released by Atari, Inc. in 1980. The game resembles a combination of &quot;Breakout&quot; and &quot;Quadrapong&quot; (an early Atari arcade game). Up to four players are able to play the game at the same time and the &quot;castles&quot; in the four corners of the screen are brick walls that can be destroyed with a flaming ball.

&quot;Warlords&quot; used spinner controllers for player control and came in both a two-player upright version and a four-player cocktail version. The upright version used a black and white monitor and reflected the game image onto a mirror, with a backdrop of castles, giving the game a 3D feel. The upright version only supported up to two simultaneous players, who moved through the levels as a team. The cocktail version was in color and supported 1–4 players. Three-to-four player games were free-for-alls where the game ended as soon as one player won. One-to-two player games played identical to the upright version.

According to Atari production numbers, 1014 uprights and 1253 cocktails were produced. The prototype version of &quot;Warlords&quot; was called &quot;Castles and Kings&quot; and was housed in a large four-player &quot;Sprint 4-like&quot; cabinet. Only two versions of the prototype were made. The game was considered a success, although a redesign to a smaller cabinet was necessary, as the large cabinet made it impossible to produce in large quantities and unfeasible to install.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Warlords&quot; is a battle between four warlords, 1-4 of which can be controlled by the player(s). The objective is to destroy the three other castles while protecting one&#x27;s own castle with a moving shield. Each castle is an L-shaped wall distinguished by a different color, each containing and protecting a Warlord icon (a crown for player-controlled Kings, a dark lord helmet for computer-controlled Black Knights). On the upright version, multiple players must cooperate as a team.

The weapons for accomplishing this are spinning fireballs which bounce off anything they touch and destroy chunks of a castle wall on contact. Fireballs can be caught, held, and thrown by shields for greater hitting force, via a &quot;Power stone&quot; button, but at the cost of slowly deteriorating the player&#x27;s own walls. When an icon is destroyed it releases another fireball onto the playfield, traveling in the opposite direction of the killing shot. The first fireball is launched by a dragon, always at a human player. Subsequent fireballs, up to a maximum of four at once, appear after timeouts or when a warlord icon is destroyed.

The last player with their icon intact is awarded a point bonus. A game ends when all human players are eliminated.

== Development ==
The Atari 2600 version of the game was released in 1981 and was written by Carla Meninsky. The debugger was Jerry Richardson.

The coin-op group developed the arcade version from the same &quot;Castles and Kings&quot; concept, adding and changing features to make the game more suitable for coin-operated play.

==Reception==
Critical reception of the game was positive. &quot;Warlords&quot; won an award for &quot;Best &#x27;Pong&#x27; Variant&quot; and an honorable mention for &quot;Best Competitive Game&quot; at the 3rd annual Arkie Awards. Arkie Award judges characterized the game as &quot;something really new and different in &#x27;Pong&#x27;-style designs&quot;, and commented that &quot;Warlords&quot; &quot;delivers plenty of on-screen excitement&quot;.

Richard A. Edwards reviewed the home cartridge version of &quot;Warlords&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 47. Edwards commented that &quot;If you have a need for a multi-player game for your Atari, then that is it. But for one or two players, it&#x27;d be better to pass it up.&quot;

In 2009 &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked it the 25th best video game of all time. The staff called it the &quot;original trash-talking four-player combat game&quot; and felt that it held up years later.

==Legacy==
In 2002, a 3D remake of Warlords was included in the Atari Revival pack, which also included the previously released Missile Command and Combat 3D remakes.

A port of &quot;Warlords&quot;, including a &quot;remix&quot; version, is included in &quot;Retro Atari Classics&quot; for the Nintendo DS. It allows multiplayer play through wireless. It was released on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on May 27, 2008, featuring a new special HD mode and Xbox Live Vision Camera support.

The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of &quot;Warlords&quot; were made available on Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Game Room&quot; service for its Xbox 360 console and for Microsoft Windows in June 2010 and December 2010 respectively.

A new version of &quot;Warlords&quot; was released on PlayStation Network on October 9, 2012, in North America and October 10, 2012, in Europe. It was also released on Xbox Live Arcade on November 14, 2012. The Xbox Live Arcade version had been made available on Xbox One and Xbox Series through backward compatibility program on November 15, 2021.

In 2004, Bryan Edewaard developed and published an unlicensed homebrew version of &quot;Warlords&quot; for the Atari 5200 and Atari 8-bit computers named &quot;Castle Crisis&quot;. In 2006, Darrell Spice Jr. released &quot;Medieval Mayhem&quot;, a homebrew Atari 2600 game inspired by &quot;Warlords&quot;. In 2011, a Commodore 64 clone was released as &quot;Space Lords&quot;. It supports a 4 player adapter.

In 1999, Working Designs included an 8 player remake of Warlords as an Easter Egg on the &quot;Making of&quot; disc in . The remake is titled &quot;Lords of Lunar&quot; by Timon Marmex Trezpacz and is accessed by pressing (up, down, left, right, triangle, start) as soon as the &quot;Making of&quot; video begins.

<doc id="737584" wikidata="Q243543" url="?curid=737584" title="Toyota Corolla">
<text>The is a series of compact cars (formerly subcompact) manufactured and marketed globally by the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. Introduced in 1966, the Corolla was the best-selling car worldwide by 1974 and has been one of the best-selling cars in the world since then. In 1997, the Corolla became the best-selling nameplate in the world, surpassing the Volkswagen Beetle. Toyota reached the milestone of 50 million Corollas sold over twelve generations in 2021. 

The name &quot;Corolla&quot; is part of Toyota&#x27;s naming tradition of using names derived from the Toyota Crown for sedans, with &quot;&quot; Latin for &quot;small crown&quot;. The Corolla has always been exclusive in Japan to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; locations, and manufactured in Japan with a twin, called the Toyota Sprinter until 2000. From 2006 to 2018 in Japan and much of the world, and from 2018 to 2020 in Taiwan, the hatchback companion had been called the Toyota Auris.

Early models were mostly rear-wheel drive, while later models have been front-wheel drive. Four-wheel drive versions have also been produced, and it has undergone several major redesigns. The Corolla&#x27;s traditional competitors have been the Nissan Sunny, introduced the same year as the Corolla in Japan and the later Nissan Sentra, Subaru Leone, Honda Civic and Mitsubishi Lancer. The Corolla&#x27;s chassis designation code is &quot;E&quot;, as described in Toyota&#x27;s chassis and engine codes.


== Production locations ==
Corollas are manufactured in Japan at the original Takaoka plant built in 1966. Various production facilities have been built in Brazil, (Indaiatuba, São Paulo), Canada (Cambridge, Ontario), China (Tianjin), Pakistan (Karachi), South Africa (Durban), Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey (Sakarya), and the United Kingdom (Derbyshire). Production or assembly has previously been carried out in Australia (Dandenong and Altona), India (Bangalore), Indonesia (Jakarta), Malaysia (Shah Alam), New Zealand (Thames), the Philippines (Santa Rosa, Laguna), and Venezuela.

Corollas were made at NUMMI in Fremont, California until March 2010. Production resumed in November 2011 at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Mississippi in Blue Springs, Mississippi.

== First generation (E10; 1966) ==

The first generation Corolla was introduced in November 1966 with the new 1100 cc K pushrod engine. The Corolla Sprinter was introduced as the fastback version in 1968, and exclusive to a Toyota Japan dealership retail outlet called &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot;. It was the second car available to Japanese buyers at &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; next to the Toyota Publica.

== Second generation (E20; 1970) ==

In May 1970, the E20 was restyled with a more rounded body. The now mutually exclusive Corolla and Sprinter names were used to differentiate between two slightly different treatments of sheet metal and trim. The Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno names were introduced as the enhanced performance version of the Corolla and Sprinter respectively when a double overhead camshaft version of the 2T engine was introduced in March 1972 (TE27).

In September 1970, the 1400 cc T and 1600 cc 2T OHV engines were added to the range.

In Australia, only the 1.2 L engine (3K) powered 2-door KE20 was available as a sedan and wagon / panelvan. The brakes were single system with no booster, solid discs on the front and rear drums. Front sway bar but no rear sway bar. Parts are not compatible with later models.

In New Zealand, the 4-door KE20 was available alongside the 2-door KE25 and KE26 2-door wagon respectively.

Most models stopped production in July 1974 but the KE26 wagon and van were still marketed in Japan alongside the new 30-series, until production finally ended in May 1978.

== Third generation (E30, E40, E50, E60; 1974) ==

April 1974 brought rounder, bigger and heavier Corollas and Sprinters. The range was rounded out with the addition of a two-door liftback. The Corollas were given E30 codes while the Sprinters were given E40 codes. A facelift in March 1976 saw most Corolla E30 models replaced by equivalent E50 models and most Sprinter E40 models were replaced by equivalent E60 models. The E30 Corolla was fitted with retracting front seat belts.

In Australia, the KE3x/KE5x was available as 4-door sedan (KE30/KE55), 2-door sedan (KE30), 2-door hardtop coupe (KE35/KE55), 2-door panel van (KE36/KE38), 4-door wagon (KE36/KE38) and a 2-door liftback (KE50/KE55). All KE3x models had 3K engines and K40 4-speed manual, K50 5 speed manual, 2-speed automatic or 3-speed automatic gearbox. Sprinters were not available. The KE5x models 4K engines. The KE55 was 50 kg heavier due to the addition of side impact protection in the doors, but due to a change in the body metal and seam sealing they are prone to rust. Later KE55s also used plastic ended bumper bars as opposed to the all chrome bumpers of the previous models, but included a rear sway bar for the first time.

== Fourth generation (E70; 1979) ==

A major restyle in March 1979 brought a square edged design. The Corollas had a simpler treatment of the grill, headlights and tail lights while the Sprinter used a slightly more complex, sculptured treatment. The new A series engines were added to the range as a running change. This was the last model to use the K &quot;hicam&quot; and T series engines. Fuel injection was introduced as an extra cost option on Japanese market vehicles.

The wagon and van continued to be made until June 1987 after the rest of the range was replaced by the E80 generation.

== Fifth generation (E80; 1983) ==

A sloping front bonnet and a contemporary sharp-edged, no-frills style was brought in during May 1983. The new 1839 cc 1C diesel engine was added to the range with the E80 Series. From 1985, re-badged E80 Sprinters were sold in the U.S. as the fifth-generation Chevrolet Nova. Fuel injection was introduced as an extra cost option internationally.

Most models now used the front-wheel drive layout except the AE85 and AE86, which were to be the last Corollas offered in the rear-wheel drive or FR layout. The AE85 and AE86 chassis codes were also used for the Sprinter (including the Sprinter Trueno). The Sprinter was nearly identical to the Corolla, differing only by minor body styling changes such as pop-up headlights.

This generation was made until 1990 in Venezuela.

== Sixth generation (E90; 1987) ==

A somewhat more rounded and aerodynamic style was used for the E90 introduced in May 1987. Overall this generation has a more refined feel than older Corollas and other older subcompacts. Most models were now front-wheel drive, along with a few AWD All-Trac models. Many engines were used on a wide array of trim levels and models, ranging from the 1.3-liter 2E to the supercharged 4A-GZE. In the US, the E90 Sprinter was built and sold as both the Toyota Sprinter and the Geo Prizm. In Australia, the E90 Corolla was built and sold as both the Toyota Corolla and the Holden Nova.

In South Africa, this generation continued to be built until August 2006.

== Seventh generation (E100; 1991) ==

In June 1991, Corollas received a redesign to be larger, heavier, and have the completely rounded, aerodynamic shape of the 1990s. In the United States, the somewhat larger Corolla was now in the compact class, rather than subcompact, and the coupé was still available in some markets, known as the AE101 Corolla Levin. Carburetors were mostly retired with this generation.

== Eighth generation (E110; 1995) ==

Production of the E110 Corolla started in May 1995. The design of the car was slightly altered throughout but retained a look similar to that of the E100. In 1998, for the first time, some non-Japanese Corollas received the new 1ZZ-FE engine. The 1ZZ-FE engine had an aluminum engine block and aluminum cylinder heads, which made models powered by this motor lighter than versions powered by A series engines which had cast iron blocks with aluminium heads. The model range began to change as Toyota decided styling differences would improve sales in different markets. Starting with this generation, General Motors renamed the Geo Prizm, a rebadge of the Toyota Sprinter, as the Chevrolet Prizm when the Geo brand was discontinued.

This generation was delayed in North America until mid-1997 (US 1998 model year), where it had unique front and rear styling. Europe and Australasia received versions of their own as well. In Pakistan, this model was halted in November 1998, while production was closed in March 2002.

== Ninth generation (E120, E130; 2000) ==
In August 2000, the E120 ninth-generation Corolla was introduced in Japan, with edgier styling and more technology to bring the nameplate into the 21st century. This version was sold in Japan, Australasia, Europe and the Middle East.

In mid-2001, the E120 Corolla Altis was released. It had a refreshed look and was slightly longer and wider than the E120 for other markets, but with similar body panels and interior. The Altis was sold in Southeast Asia, India, and Taiwan. India received a de-tuned version of the 1ZZ-FE and was comparatively slower than its rivals.

The North American release was delayed until March 2002 (for the 2003 model year). The E130 was sold in North America from 2003 to 2008. It had similar look to the Corolla Altis sold in Southeast Asia. The E120 continued in parallel in separate markets to the E130.

The station wagon model is called the Corolla Fielder in Japan. Production in Japan ended in January 2007 (for Corolla Runx and Allex), but production in North America continued until October 2007.

Production continued in China as the Corolla EX until February 2017.

== Tenth generation (E140, E150; 2006) ==
=== Japan (E140 narrow) ===
The tenth generation of the E140 Corolla was introduced in October 2006. Japanese markets called the sedan Corolla Axio. The station wagon retained the Corolla Fielder name.
=== International (E140/E150 wide) ===
For international markets, a wider version of the E140 was sold with different styling, with the Southeast Asian, Pakistani, Indian and Taiwanese markets retaining the Corolla Altis branding. Production continued from June 2014 until 2020 in South Africa as the entry-level Corolla Quest.

In Australasia, the related first-generation Toyota Auris was also sold as the Corolla hatchback alongside the sedan body shape of the International E140 Corolla.

== Eleventh generation (E160, E170, E180; 2012) ==

=== Japan (E160; 2012) ===

The eleventh generation of the Corolla went on sale in Japan in May 2012. The sedan is named the Corolla Axio while the wagon is called the Corolla Fielder. In Japan, both are made by a Toyota subsidiary, Central Motors, in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. The redesigned model has slightly smaller exterior dimensions and is easier to drive in narrow alleys and parking lots for the targeted elderly drivers.

The new Corolla Axio is available with either a 1.3-liter &quot;1NR-FE&quot; or 1.5-liter &quot;1NZ-FE&quot; four-cylinder engines; front- or all-wheel drive. Both 5-speed manual and CVT transmissions are offered. The 1.3-liter engine and all-wheel-drive variants are available only with the CVT transmission. The Corolla Fielder is available with 1.5-liter &quot;1NZ-FE&quot; or 1.8-liter &quot;2ZR-FAE&quot; four cylinder engines mated with a CVT transmission. The 1.5-liter is available with front- and all-wheel drive, the 1.8-liter is offered only in front-wheel drive. Since 2015 there&#x27;s a new engine 2NR-FKE, with its VVT-ie technology.

Toyota released hybrid versions of the Corolla Axio sedan and Corolla Fielder station wagon for the Japanese market in August 2013. Both cars are equipped with a 1.5-liter hybrid system similar to the one used in the Toyota Prius C, with a fuel efficiency of under the JC08 test cycle. Toyota&#x27;s monthly sales target for Japan is 1,000 units of the Corolla Axio hybrid and 1,500 units of the Corolla Fielder hybrid.

The E160 was also sold in Hong Kong, Macau, and New Zealand.

=== International (E170/E180; 2013) ===

International markets continued on with the E140/E150 until at least 2013 when the E170/E180 model arrived. The E170/E180 is larger and substantially different from the Japanese E160, with a unique body and interior. Two basic front and rear styling treatments are fitted to the E170: a North American version that debuted first and a more conservative design for other markets that debuted later in 2013. The latter version sold in Southeast Asian, Pakistani, Indian and Taiwanese markets retained the Corolla Altis branding. The Corolla E180 went on sale in Europe and South Africa in February 2014.

In Australasia, the European market second-generation Toyota Auris was also sold badged as the Corolla hatchback, alongside the international E170 Corolla. 

In 2015, for the 2016 model year, Toyota’s North American Sub-brand, Scion, introduced the Scion iM, based on the second generation Toyota Auris. In 2016, for the 2017 model year, the iM was rebranded as the Toyota Corolla iM when the Scion brand was discontinued.

== Twelfth generation (E210; 2018) ==
The twelfth generation of the Corolla is available in three body styles:

=== Hatchback ===

The twelfth generation Corolla in hatchback body style was unveiled as a pre-production model in early March 2018 at the Geneva Motor Show as the Auris. The production version of the Corolla Hatchback for the North American market was unveiled on 28 March 2018 at the New York International Auto Show, with the official details and photos revealed on 22 March 2018. The Corolla Hatchback was launched in Japan on 27 June 2018 as the Corolla Sport. The Corolla Hatchback went on sale in the United States in mid-July 2018, and was later launched in Australia on 7 August 2018. Production of the European market Corolla Hatchback began on 14 January 2019, and sales began in the UK in February 2019 and across Europe in March 2019.

A high-performance variant of the Corolla hatchback, called the GR Corolla, debuted in March 2022.

=== Estate ===
The estate variation of the twelfth generation Corolla, called the Corolla Touring Sports (simply called Corolla Touring in Japan), was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show. The official images of the Corolla Touring Sports were revealed on 4 September 2018.

The Corolla Touring Sports is also sold by Suzuki as the Swace in Europe.

=== Sedan ===
The sedan variation of the Corolla was unveiled simultaneously between 15 and 16 November 2018 in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, United States, and in China at the 2018 Guangzhou International Motor Show. The model is sold in two versions: &quot;Prestige&quot; (sold in China, Europe and other countries) and &quot;Sporty&quot; (sold in North America, Japan, Australia and other countries), and sold in China as the Levin. The Prestige model uses a different front fascia, which is more similar to the XV70 Camry. This model is sold as the Corolla Altis in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The Sporty model uses a similar front fascia to the hatchback and wagon versions. A long-wheelbase version of the Prestige model with a slightly altered front fascia is sold as the Allion in China, while the long-wheelbase Sporty version is called the Levin GT.

== Sales ==
== Alternative versions ==

In Japan, the Corolla has always been exclusive to the Japanese retail sales chain called &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot;, which was previously established in 1961, known as &quot;Toyota Publica Store&quot;, selling the Publica. A rebadged version called the Sprinter was introduced around the same time as the Corolla in Japan, and sold through a different Toyota Japan dealership sales channel known since 1966 as &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot;.

There have been several models over the years, including the Corolla Ceres (and similar Sprinter Marino) hardtop, Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno sports coupés and hatchbacks, and the Corolla FX hatchback, which became the Corolla RunX, while the Sprinter became the Allex, with the introduction of the E120 series Corolla. The RunX and Allex was replaced by the Auris in 2006 (known only as Corolla in markets outside Japan, Europe and South Africa). A luxury version of the Auris installed with V6 engines was briefly sold at Japanese Toyota dealerships &quot;Toyota Store&quot; and &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; locations as the Blade, which was sold until 2012.

A compact MPV named the Corolla Verso has also been released in European markets. Its Japanese counterpart is the Corolla Spacio, which has been discontinued as of the tenth generation. The Corolla Rumion is also sold in the US market as the Scion xB.

The Corolla Matrix, better known just as the Matrix, shares the E120 and E140 platforms, and is considered the hatchback/sport wagon counterpart of the North American Corolla sedan, as the European/Australasian Corolla hatchback is not sold there. Toyota frequently combines the sales figures of the Corolla sedan and Matrix. The Pontiac Vibe, which is the General Motors badged version of the Matrix, shares the Corolla platform. The Vibe was exported from Fremont, California, to the Japanese market where it was sold as the Toyota Voltz.

The Corolla Cross is the crossover SUV-counterpart of the E210 series Corolla.

Over many years, there have been rebadged versions of the Corolla, sold by General Motors, including the Holden Nova in Australia during the early 1990s, and the Sprinter-based Chevrolet Nova, Chevrolet Prizm, and Geo Prizm (in the United States as part of the GM S platform). The Corolla liftback (TE72) of Toyota Australia was badged as simply the T-18. The five-door liftback was sold with the Corolla Seca name in Australia and the nameplate survived on successive five-door models.

The Daihatsu Charmant was produced from the E30 to the E70 series.

The Tercel was a front wheel drive car, first introduced in 1980 at Japanese Toyota dealerships called &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot;, and was called the Corolla Tercel then, and later given its own name in 1984. The Tercel platform was also used for the Corolla II hatchback in Japan.

<text>The Toyota Camry (; Japanese: トヨタ・カムリ &quot;Toyota Kamuri&quot;) is an automobile sold internationally by the Japanese auto manufacturer Toyota since 1982, spanning multiple generations. Originally compact in size (narrow-body), the Camry has grown since the 1990s to fit the mid-size classification (wide-body)—although the two widths co-existed in that decade. Since the release of the wide-bodied versions, Camry has been extolled by Toyota as the firm&#x27;s second &quot;world car&quot; after the Corolla. , the Camry is positioned above the Corolla and below the Avalon or Crown in several markets.

In Japan, the Camry was once exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store retail dealerships. Narrow-body cars also spawned a rebadged sibling in Japan, the Toyota Vista (トヨタ・ビスタ)—also introduced in 1982 and sold at Toyota Vista Store locations. Diesel fuel versions have previously retailed at Toyota Diesel Store. The Vista Ardeo was a wagon version of the Vista V50.


== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Camry&quot; derives from the Japanese word (:ja:冠, かんむり), meaning &quot;&quot;. This follows Toyota&#x27;s naming tradition of using the crown name for primary models starting with the Toyota Crown (1955), continuing with the Toyota Corona (1957) and Corolla (1966); the Latin words for &quot;crown&quot; and &quot;small crown&quot;, respectively. Maintaining this theme was the Toyota Tiara (1960), named after the &quot;tiara&quot; form of crown. The Atara trim level name, used on the Camry in Australia since 2011, means &quot;crown&quot; in Hebrew. The rebadged Camry variant for Japan, the Toyota Scepter (1991), took its name from &quot;scepter&quot;, a royal accessory to a crown. In 1980 the Toyota Cresta was introduced to Japan only, and was based on the Toyota Mark II. &#x27;Cresta&#x27; is Latin for a decorative, ceremonial feature added to the top of a helmet.

==History==
Between 1979 and 1982, the Camry nameplate was delegated to a four-door sedan model in Japan, known as the Celica Camry. When Camry became an independent model line in 1982 with the V10 series, Toyota made it available as a five-door liftback in addition to the sedan. The subsequent Camry V20 series, debuted in 1986 with a station wagon substituting for the liftback body variant and Japan-only hardtop sedans making their debut. The company replaced the V20 in 1990 with the V30 sedan and hardtop, but this model series was exclusive to Japan. Automotive tax regulations in that country dictated the retention of a narrower body as used in previous Camry generations. However, overseas demand for a larger Camry resulted in the development of a wide-body XV10 sedan and station wagon that arrived in 1991. Japan also received the wider XV10 as the Toyota Scepter (トヨタ・セプター). The company then issued an XV10-bodied coupé in 1993 that was spun off in 1998 as an independent model line, titled Camry Solara.

When the Japanese market received a new narrow-body V40 series in 1994 to replace V30, the wide-body XV10 continued unchanged. Its replacement, the XV20, arrived in 1996—named Camry Gracia in Japan. It was not until the narrow V40 ended manufacture in 1998 that the Camry in Japan was to again mirror the cars sold internationally. Japanese sedans dropped the Gracia suffix in 1999, although it was retained by the wagon until its 2001 demise. From 1998, the Vista ended its Camry alignment, and instead branched into an independent model line with the V50 series for an extra generation before the nameplate was withdrawn in 2003.

The next wide-body model, the XV30, came in 2001. Now sold only as a sedan, it now offered two different front- and rear-end design treatments. Japan and most global markets received one style; a separate, more conservative version covered markets in East and Southeast Asia. With the XV40 of 2006, the Camry-derived Aurion become the donor model for the more conservative Camry sold in this region. The subsequent XV50 series, sold from 2011 until 2019, has resulted in even more markets adopting the alternative body panels, such as Japan and Eastern Europe. The current generation is called the XV70.

When Toyota launched their luxury Lexus brand in 1989, it offered a close derivative of the Camry/Vista hardtop sedan as the Lexus ES. The relationship continues to this day, but over the generations, the ES—sold as the Toyota Windom in Japan from 1991 through to 2005—gravitated further away from its Camry brethren. Between 2000 and 2010, and then 2012 and 2023, Daihatsu had offered a badge engineered Camry as the Daihatsu Altis (ダイハツ・アルティス) sold only in Japan. Badge engineering has also occurred in Australia with the Holden Apollo between 1989 and 1996. From 1993, Toyota Australia badged V6-engined versions as Camry Vienta, becoming Toyota Vienta in 1995 until the badge&#x27;s departure in 2000. Between 2006 and 2017, the Toyota Aurion model from Australia was derived from the V6 Camry, but with revised front-end and rear-end styling treatment and a partially refurbished cabin.

Sales of the Camry ended in late 2023 for the Japanese market after 43 years as the result of poor sales.

=== Celica Camry (A40/A50; 1979–1982) ===

The &quot;Camry&quot; nameplate originated on a four-door sedan approximate to the Toyota Celica called the Celica Camry. Toyota designated this initial application of the Camry name as the A40/A50 series. Celica Camry made its sales debut in January 1980 at &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; retail dealerships in Japan. Production had earlier commenced in December 1979 at the Tsutsumi plant at Toyota, Aichi. Despite the marketing position, Celica Camry shares few components with its namesake—but rather the Carina (A40/A50). Toyota modified the Carina by elongating its front-end and incorporating styling cues such as the T-bar grille motif that resembled the Celica XX/Supra (A40). Strictly speaking, Celica Camry is not the first generation of Camry, but rather its predecessor.

Celica Camry uses the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and in A40 guise, a standard four-link rigid axle suspension system with gasoline inline-four engines displacing 1.6 liters for the &quot;12T-U&quot; (TA41) and 1.8 liters with the &quot;13T-U&quot; (TA46). Initial model grades comprised: 1600 LT, 1600 XT, 1800 LT, 1800 XT, and 1800 XT Super Edition. In August 1980, Toyota released high-end models with four-wheel independent suspension, denoted A50 (front MacPherson struts, rear semi-trailing arm setup; four-wheel disc brakes). For the TA57 series 1800 SX, Toyota fitted the 1.8-liter &quot;3T-EU&quot; engine. Toyota designated the new 2.0-liter grades, the &quot;21R-U&quot; powered 2000 SE and &quot;18R-GEU&quot;-based 2000 GT as RA56 and RA55, respectively.

The Celica Camry was available in six exterior colors with contrasting blue, gray, or brown interiors, and the XT Super Edition offered two-tone exterior paint in dark brown over light brown. Power steering with adjustable tilt steering, air conditioning, two stereo choices, a choice of a digital or electric analog clock, rear window defroster, and rear child door lockout were available. The side-view mirrors installed on the fenders ahead of the front wheels were electrically adjustable on higher trim packages and manually adjustable on entry-level models. The aluminum alloy wheels were shared with the Celica and Supra on higher trim packages.
=== V10 (1982–1986) ===
Toyota started production of the first generation series Camry in March 1982 at the Tsutsumi plant. Designated the model code V10, when fitted with S-series gasoline engines it was known as the SV10, SV11, or SV12 depending on the exact version. Likewise, the C-series diesel versions are identified by the CV10 and CV11 codes. Released to the Japanese market on 24 March 1982, Toyota issued the V10 series as a four-door notchback sedan retailing at the &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; dealerships. At the same time, a twinned model—the Toyota Vista—launched as a rebadged Camry sold at separate &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; locations. Five-door liftback versions of the Vista came to the market in August 1982, although outside of export markets the Camry remained exclusively a sedan. These cars served above the comparably sized Toyota Carina and Corona in the Toyota hierarchy. Unlike the preceding Celica Camry, exports were achieved with the first generation Camry to Australia, Europe and North America.

Development of the V10 series Camry and Vista began in August 1977 following the 1973 oil crisis and would later cover the 1979 crisis. Automobile manufacturers were making the inexorable move to downsized, lighter, more fuel efficient cars with better aerodynamic performance. The industry also began wide-scale switching from the rear-wheel-drive layout to the lighter and more compact front-wheel-drive in the interest of increased fuel economy. With a development focus on exports, particularly to the US, Toyota designed Camry to replace the Toyota Corona (T130) in many overseas markets. It needed to compete with the compact, front-drive Honda Accord sedan from Japan. Via one-upmanship, Camry exceeded the Accord&#x27;s wheelbase by and offered larger engines. The design brief also established the compact front-wheel-drive X platform vehicles by General Motors in the US as competitors. In light of this competition—and a first for Toyota—the V10 adopted front-wheel drive with the engine transversely mounted. Between this layout that reduced the size of the engine compartment, the notchback sedan and liftback bodies with rear quarter windows, and the longer wheelbase of —the V10 series was considered spacious for its time and class. Furthermore, by situating the fuel tank underneath the back seat, luggage space is increased. The styling of the V10 followed the box-shaped trends characteristic of the early 1980s. Wind tunnel testing led to the fitment of drag-reducing flush pillars, a flat roofline to reduce wind buffeting, and one-piece front bumper with air dam to direct air flow. Drag coefficient is quoted at for the sedan and for the liftback.

Coil spring independent suspension features by way of a MacPherson strut type with stabilizer and strut bar up front, and a MacPherson rear setup with parallel lower arms. Steering uses a rack and pinion design; braking hardware is made up of front ventilated discs and rear drums with a double proportioning valve to suppress lock-up. Innovatively, a sensor is fitted to detect worn-out brake pads, alerted by use of an audible chime.

Powertrain design was reassessed for front-wheel-drive and this generated a foundation for which other models were developed. The transaxle is connected inline with the engine, and to create a simple and compact structure, a single rail system that replaces the three shafts normally used for each gear range with a single shaft, was adopted. In addition, automatic transmission fluid was used for the lubricating oil in order to reduce friction. Existing gasoline S- and diesel C-series engines were converted for use in transverse applications. Initially, the V10 featured the 1.8-liter &quot;1S-LU&quot; engine good for and an S50 five-speed manual transmission. From July 1982, four-speed automatic with overdrive became available after starting manufacture the previous month. The 2.0-liter &quot;2S-ELU&quot; engine with an improved S51 five-speed manual transmission and four-speed automatic followed in August. August 1983 saw the 1.8-liter &quot;1C-TL&quot; turbocharged diesel offered () exclusive to Japanese dealerships called &quot;Toyota Diesel Store&quot;. June 1984 introduced the twin-cam 2.0-liter &quot;3S-GELU&quot; engine offered on higher trims with depending on the version. For lower trims, the &quot;Ci&quot; 1.8-liter &quot;1S-iLU&quot; arrived. The diesel was upgraded to the 2.0-liter &quot;2C-TL&quot; specification in August 1985 ().

Japanese trims levels initially comprised LT, XT, SE, and ZX for Camry sedan. Lumiere and XE grades came to the market in June 1984, and the GLi TwinCam in May 1985. Vista sedan and liftback specification levels were at first VC (sedan only), VL, VE, and VX. The VF arrived in August 1982, and VR and VS models in June 1984 at the expense of the departing VE. Special edition models comprised: VE Extra (December 1982), VL Extra (January 1983), VL Super Extra (January 1985), VF-II (April 1985 and April 1986), and VL Grand Extra (December 1985 and April 1986). Wing mirrors became door-mounted as opposed to fender-mounted in May 1983. Facelifted models arrived in June 1984 featuring a new grille, redesigned bumpers, revised tail-lamps, updated dashboard, enlarged glovebox, and general trim alterations.

The shift to smaller cars amid the oil crises doubled Japanese automobile market share from 10 to 20 percent in the United States between 1970 and 1980; thus, causing economic tensions between the two nations. Toyota then began investigating the option of building a US production facility, following the announcements in January and April 1980 by Honda and Nissan, respectively, to manufacture automobiles locally. As investigations proceeded, Toyota proposed entering a joint venture with Ford in May 1980 to produce a compact car. Toyota advocated that its Camry be manufactured at a Ford factory and sold through the sales channels of both brands, but Ford deemed Camry to be in competition with a model it was developing, which became the Ford Tempo, leading to an impasse and then the cessation of negotiations in July 1981. Increasing Japan–United States unease culminated with the Japanese government, at the urging of its US counterpart, imposing a voluntary cartel in May 1981 with a threshold for the export of motor vehicles to the US. Toyota would eventually pursue circumvention; firstly by entering into venture by forming NUMMI with General Motors in 1984 to manufacture the Toyota Corolla, and then by setting up its own facility at Georgetown, Kentucky in 1988 for the next generation Camry.

Sales of the V10 Camry in the US began in March 1983 after exports commenced in January, and by 1985 it had sold 128,000 units. Unlike other markets, federalized quad headlamps were fitted for the 1983 and 1984 model years. Buyers could specify sedan or liftback bodies with a five-speed manual transmission or extra-cost four-speed automatic paired to the 2.0-liter gasoline &quot;2S-ELC&quot; motor rated at . Toyota then offered DX (deluxe) and LE (luxury edition) trim levels, the latter adding standard features such as body-colored bumpers, tachometer, tilt steering wheel, upgraded stereo, electric mirrors and variable intermittent windshield wipers. Updates for the 1984 model year included an overdrive lockout switch for the automatic transmission. Also optional was the manual-only 1.8-liter &quot;1C-TLC&quot; turbo diesel for the DX with , a special gauge cluster, and quieter exhaust system. Changes for 1985 involved the facelift (now with one-piece headlamps), the transfer of the optional cruise control&#x27;s switchgear from the dashboard to the wiper stalk, and wider LE-type tires for the DX trim (from ). 1985 cars received gas-charged front shock absorbers and stiffer rear springs, an anti-theft alarm system was now optional on both grades, automatic became an option for the diesel, the DX added a standard tilt steering wheel, and the LE models offered an optional electronic instrument cluster. For 1986, a replacement diesel engine, the automatic-only 2.0-liter &quot;2C-TLC&quot; arrived for the DX and LE (), and the gasoline model increased power by around . Other revisions for this model year were a revised powered brake system and new cloth seat and door trim for LEs.

For Australia, the Camry range—based on the Vista front styling—was limited to a single-grade GLi liftback variant between April 1983 and April 1987. Sold as an upmarket alternative to the locally produced Toyota Corona (T140), the sole powertrain offered was the gasoline 2.0-liter &quot;2S-EL&quot; engine with coupled with the five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Optional extras included powering steering, air conditioning, electric moonroof, power doors and windows, plus an upgraded stereo. Facelifted models with more standard appointments arrived in August 1984, and the unleaded version from early 1986 reduced power output by .

Europe and the United Kingdom received both body variants when released there in mid 1984—these were available in the gasoline DX trim (1.8- &quot;1S-L&quot;) and 2.0-liter GLi (&quot;2S-EL&quot;) or the GLD turbo diesel (1.8- &quot;1C-TL&quot; in early models; later models upgraded to the 2.0-liter &quot;2C-TL&quot;).

=== V20 (1986–1992) ===
The second generation, V20 series Camry went on sale during August 1986 in Japan. As with the previous series, there was again a parallel Vista model for the home market that Toyota released simultaneously. V20 Camry and Vista sedans continued with the four-door sedan configuration. For overseas markets, Toyota issued a station wagon for the first time. The Vista also launched with a four-door pillared hardtop sedan with unique body panels all-round in lieu of the liftback offered with the previous car—a body extended to the Camry in August 1988. To attain a sportier appearance with lower and wider proportions, Toyota reduced the height of the hardtop by over the sedan. Not intended for export, this hardtop body with few changes would later form the basis of the upscale but hastily conceived Lexus ES 250 produced for North American customers from June 1989 through to 1991. Toyota rushed the ES 250 as a stopgap measure to flesh out the fledgling Lexus lineup so as not to launch the flagship LS 400 as a stand-alone model.

The V20 Camry originated from a time at Toyota when considerable cost and attention to detail was engineered into its cars such as high-quality materials and build quality to transcend the competition. Sedans retained the V10&#x27;s rear quarter glass with styling less angular than before. To appease export customers, styling lost some of its Japanese legacy in its transition to a more Americanized design, with a softer and sleeker silhouette. Toyota designed the body with aerodynamics in mind, with performance of for the sedan. V20 also features headlamps and a grille that are sculptured into a gently curved hood that partially conceal the windshield wipers, wind splitters up the ends of the windshield, near-flush glass, and a third door seal to close the gap between the body and window frames. Body dimensions were largely unchanged from the previous model, including an identical wheelbase, although length increases . Basic sub-skin hardware is also closely related, including the platform and the fully independent suspension with a strut and a coil spring at each corner and an anti-roll bar at each end. Noise isolation is improved by mounting the rear suspension on a subframe akin to the Toyota Celica (T160) that had now switched to Camry-based mechanicals. As before, the braking package encompasses ventilated discs up front, conventional drums in the rear, upgraded to rear discs in some cars. The braking system has a tandem-type booster and diagonally divided hydraulic circuits. Wagons receive a load-sensing proportioning valve that grants greater braking pressure when laden and prevents wheel lockup under light payloads. Entry-level V20 wheel size increases from 13 to 14 inches.

All engines now use fuel injection exclusively and were common to Camry and Vista. Entry-level customers were offered the carry-over &quot;Ci&quot; 1.8-liter &quot;1S-i&quot; (designated &quot;1S-iLU&quot; in the V10) inline-four with five-speed manual or an automatic with four gears. Stepping up from this were the new &quot;3S-FE&quot; and GT high-performance &quot;3S-GE&quot; (designated &quot;3S-GELU&quot; for V10s) 2.0-liter twin-cam four-cylinder cars. Turbo-diesel models were again limited to the &quot;2C-T&quot; motor displacing 2.0 liters (labeled &quot;2C-TL&quot; for V10s). Transmission were either a five-speed manual or an electronically controlled automatic with four gears. When launched in Japan, the V20 series Camry (sedan only) offered the following trim levels: LT, XT, XT Saloon, ZE, ZT, ZX, and GT. 

For the Vista sedan, Toyota offered: VC, VL, VE, VR, and VX. Hardtop versions comprised: VE, VR, VX, and GT. Flagship models of the Japanese specification Camry sedan, the Camry Prominent and Prominent G arrived in April 1987 with the 2.0-liter &quot;1VZ-FE&quot; V6 engine, a protruding chrome grille, larger North American-type bumpers, wood grain interior highlights, an electric seat function, plus electronic instrument cluster. All-Trac full-time four-wheel-drive became an option in October 1987 with select &quot;3S-FE&quot; manual variants (VL Extra, VR); automatics equipped with an electronic front- and rear-wheel torque distribution optimizer followed in August 1988. The Vista was not available with the V6, but in April 1987, the special edition Vista VL Extra sedan and hardtop arrived, followed by the Etoile in August and again in January 1989; limited edition Etoile V cars were offered in September 1989 and January 1990. Toyota discontinued the Vista VC in December 1989 and released a special edition VX Limited in May 1989 and then again for January 1990. 

When the Camry Prominent hardtop variant arrived in August 1988, it offered base, G, and E-Type levels of trim alongside a new sedan-only Camry Lumière. Also in August 1988, a diesel version of the Vista hardtop made its debut, and the 1.8-liter gasoline engine was upgraded to the twin-cam &quot;4S-Fi&quot; specification. Special editions for the Camry comprised: Lumière S sedan (January 1989), Prominent X hardtop (May 1989), Lumière G sedan (June 1989), and XT Saloon Special sedan (January 1990).

North American market V20 series Camry sedan and wagons came to the market in late 1986 for the 1987 model year. Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky, the first wholly owned Toyota plant in the US, began producing the Camry in May 1988. The country of manufacture can be found by looking at the first character of the VIN; a Camry manufactured in Japan has a VIN starting with &quot;J&quot;, a model made in the US starts with &quot;4&quot; and a model made in Australia starts with &quot;6&quot;. All Camry station wagons for the United States originated from Japan, while sedans were a mix of Japanese built and American built, with the ratio of American-built sedans increasing yearly. Three trim levels of the V20 Camry were made: the unbadged base model, the DX, and the LE. The four-wheel-drive Camry, dubbed &quot;All-Trac&quot; was introduced for 1988 and a 2.5-liter V6 engine was also added as an option, though notably not in combination with the All-Trac option. The V6 was fuel-injected with 24 valves, and dual overhead camshafts. The 1989 model year saw the Camry&#x27;s mid-life update which included new front and rear bumper covers that were one piece instead of two, new taillight design, along with a few interior styling updates. The 1990 model year saw a slight upgrade in horsepower for V6 models, from 153 to 156. North American 1990 Camrys built from February 1990-August 1990 also saw another refresh that included Toyota&#x27;s new logo introduced that year onto the front grille. Color-keyed door handles and grille also appeared on DX and LE models, along with a new ignition chime. In 1989, anti-lock brakes became optional on the LE V6 sedan and wagon, and LE All-Trac.

1991 model year Camrys began production in August 1990, and can be identified by a newly redesigned front valence panel under the front bumper. In addition, the DX model gains new standard color keyed bumpers, new interior cloth that replaces the older tweed, and new hubcap designs on both DX and LE models.

Toyota Australia released the second generation Camry in April 1987. Local manufacture of the V20 had begun earlier in February at its recently acquired Australian Motor Industries facility at Port Melbourne, Victoria as a replacement for the Toyota Corona (T140) and the Camry before it. Four-cylinder engine production and panel-stamping was undertaken at the Toyota Australia Altona Plant all part of a model localization and factory upgrades investment totaling . In fact, it was the first Camry made outside Japan, and is notable for being the most localized Toyota Australia product thus far with a lead time of less than six months, the shortest yet between start of Japanese and Australian manufacture. Higher levels of specification were fitted with the locally built 2.0-liter &quot;3S-FE&quot; motor, but the imported 1.8-liter &quot;1S-i&quot; unit distinguished base SE and CS cars. Both sedans and wagons were offered and either engine offered standard five-speed manual transmission, upgradeable to the four-speed automatic. Features standard at the base level SE comprised: AM/FM radio, center console storage compartment, remote fuel filler release, intermittent windshield wipers, digital clock. CS cars added a tilt steering column to which the CS-X adds a key lock warning system. The CS driver&#x27;s seat has front height adjustment; the CS-X&#x27;s front and rear height adjustment. The CS gets a two speaker AM/FM radio cassette player; the CS-X a four-speaker system and automatic electric antenna, plus central locking, variable intermittent wipers and center rear arm rest. The sedan-only Ultima grade gains power windows, cruise control, automatic transmission as standard, velour trim, and a nine-stage graphic equalizer for the audio system. A fleet-focused Executive pack based on the SE arrived in May 1988, adding automatic transmission, power steering, and air conditioning. In June 1988, the 2.5-liter V6 was introduced, being an imported fully optioned model from Japan sold in limited numbers and distinguished from local four-cylinder cars by its unique bumpers and trim. Coinciding with the August 1989 facelift, the 2.0-liter &quot;3S-FC&quot; engine with carburetor superseded the imported 1.8. The updates brought minor adjustments inside and out, including improved suspension, steering, and headlights. In May 1991, Toyota made the fuel-injected &quot;3S-FE&quot; version standard upon the carbureted engine&#x27;s deletion, and the CS trim level became CSi. Coinciding with this change, power steering became standard fitment and Toyota Australia refreshed badging, including the attachment of the new corporate logo consisting of three overlapping ellipses to form the letter &quot;T&quot;. With the May 1991 update, the Ultima models gained a CD player, the first Australian-built car to offer this. Towards the end of the series, special editions were released, starting with the Spirit of February 1991. Then in September 1992, value-added CSi Limited and Olympic Spirit cars came onto the scene. Australian production ended in late November 1992, in time for production of the XV10 to commence on 2 December. The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that V20 Camry models provide an &quot;average&quot; (3/5 stars) level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.


;Holden Apollo (JK, JL)

The Holden Apollo, a rebadged variant to the Toyota Camry, retailed in Australia alongside the facelifted Camry V20 series from August 1989. Production had started in July. This model sharing occurred due to the United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI) joint venture between Toyota Australia and General Motors-Holden&#x27;s starting in 1987 that resulted in model sharing between both automakers from August 1989. Known as the JK series, the Apollo differentiated itself by way of a redesigned grille, rehashed tail lamps and other minor trim items. This rebranding scheme was the result of the Button car plan, introduced in May 1984 to rationalise and make the Australian automotive industry more competitive on a global scale by means of reducing import tariffs. Offered in sedan and wagon guises, Apollo replaced the Camira.

Powertrains were verbatim of the Camry, with the &quot;3S-FC&quot; for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the &quot;3S-FE&quot; engine. An SLX option pack, known as the Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windshield wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, as opposed to the SL model&#x27;s steel wheels with center caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windshield wipers, a four-speaker stereo, body-colored bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, center back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver&#x27;s door lock and front map lamps. As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.

In August 1991, there was a small Apollo facelift, given the designation JL, with an altered model range. The SL and SLX continued, with the SLE now available only as a sedan. The Executive pack was now no longer offered, and a sports version, dubbed GS was introduced in both body variants. Equipment levels mostly mirrored the previous JK, although the SLX was now similar in specification to the discontinued Executive and the GS to the JK SLE, albeit without standard automatic transmission. GS specification cars also added body stripes, red highlights, a tachometer and upgraded audio. Appearance-wise, the JK and JL are very similar, with the JL&#x27;s grille treated with bolder chrome highlighting and slightly altered tail lamps on sedans. The XV10 Camry-based JM Apollo replaced the JL in March 1993.

====Model codes====
=== V30 (1990–1994) ===
Introduced exclusively to Japan in July 1990, the Camry V30 carried forward the four-door sedan and a differently styled hardtop sedan. Like before, either shape could be had in a Vista branded variety with revised styling. Both bodies would also form the basis of enlarged wide-body XV10 versions from September 1991, aimed primarily at international markets. The V30 remained smaller than the XV10 to offer buyers a vehicle within the &quot;five-number&quot; registration category concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement for Japanese vehicle size regulations. The rules required a body width under , length under , and engines at or below 2,000 cc. Sedans in the wide-body format would sell overseas as the Camry XV10—identical to the smaller V30 in most respects except for the front- and rear-end styling grafted to an otherwise unchanged body and interior. Hardtop sedans would engender the luxury Lexus ES 300 (XV10), which again would couple the existing side profile with rehashed front, rear, and interior designs. The export-oriented ES 300 would sell as the Toyota Windom in Japan.

Dimensions grew slightly with sedan body length extended to , and for the Vista and Camry hardtops to , respectively. Penned by Osamu Shikado, the V30&#x27;s design is much rounder when compared to the V20 series. Rather than the V20&#x27;s six-window greenhouse, the V30 sedans have a four-part setup with integrated window sashes. Up front, the sedan&#x27;s curved headlamps converge with a slimline grille insert; hardtops get a thinner front assembly with narrower lights, and the C-pillar is raked more sharply. Base cars gain full body-color coding of peripheral exterior components.

The four-wheel strut/coil suspension carried over from the V20, although as option on high-end front-drive trims, Toyota added a wheel-stroke-sensitive Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension (TEMS) and speed sensitive four-wheel steering. The available powerplants were three twin-cam inline-four engines—the 1.8-liter &quot;4S-FE&quot;, plus the &quot;3S-FE&quot; and higher-performance &quot;3S-GE&quot; 2.0-liter units. Toyota also offered the 2.0-liter &quot;2C-T&quot; turbo-diesel inline-four known from the previous generations, and for the flagship Camry Prominent only, the 2.0-liter &quot;1VZ-FE&quot; gasoline V6. In May 1991 a 2.5-liter V6 engine also became available on the Camry Prominent, while the earlier 2-liter V6 became the &quot;Prominent E&quot;.

An updated model appeared in July 1992. The scope of changes ranged from a new, larger grille and a revised air conditioning unit. At the same time the ZX Touring package appeared in place of the GT, which Toyota discontinued in conjunction with the sporting &quot;3S-GE&quot; engine option. The 2.0 V6 engine was removed from the lineup at the same time, leaving the 2.5-liter unit as the only offering in the Camry Prominent.

=== V40 (1994–1998) ===
The Camry V40 appeared in July 1994 exclusively for the Japanese market. The Toyota Vista twin continued on, although the Camry Prominent hardtop was no longer offered; only the Vista was available as a hardtop. As before in previous generations, the Camry was exclusive to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot;, while the Vista was only available at &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; locations.

V40 continued to be built around the x length-width bracket, legacy of a Japanese taxation law. The car is taller than its predecessor.

Engines for the V40 were a 1.8-liter (4S-FE type) and 2.0-liter (3S-FE type), and a 2.2-liter turbo-diesel (3C-T type). At launch only the 2.0-liter model was available in all-wheel drive mode, although afterwards the 2.2-liter turbodiesel could be optioned with this system.

Toyota updated the V40 in June 1996. In the update anti-lock brakes and dual air bags became standard equipment. After 1998, the Japanese market Camry and international Camry became in-line with each other, with the Vista taking over the V30 and V40 Camry roles.

=== V50 (1998–2003) ===
The V50 generation was not available as a Camry—only as a Vista—as a sedan, plus a station wagon called Vista Ardeo. 1.8 L and 2.0 L engines were available. The interior features a center instrument panel/navigation display.

Vista V50 is significant because it&#x27;s one of the first fruits of Toyota&#x27;s company-wide platform renewal efforts known as the MC. Studies for new front-wheel drive (FWD) platform and packaging layout began in 1993 and appeared on market in December 1997 in the Toyota Prius, but the Vista is the first mass-production, FWD Toyota with a new platform. Toyota claims this is the first true redesign and rethink of its FWD platforms since the 1982 Camry/Vista. With this platform, Toyota trades the rear MacPherson struts for a torsion beam axle setup. A double-wishbone setup is available for all-wheel drive. Toyota also flipped the engine orientation so that the intake manifold is in front, improving space efficiency.

Vista production ended in September 2003, as Toyota prepared to rename the Vista dealership network as Toyota Netz. In October 2003, the Vista was replaced by the second generation Avensis. The move to simplify Toyota&#x27;s dealership organization came in light of the pending (August 2005) launch of Lexus in Japan. In April 2005 the process was complete and all Vista dealers became Netz dealers.

== Wide-body ==

=== XV10 (1991–1996) ===

Toyota replaced the compact V20 Camry with the Japanese market-only V30 series in 1990. However, international markets such as Australia and North America received a widened version of the V30, known as the XV10 series. While marginally larger than the V20, the V30 had to comply with Japanese dimension regulations, which restricted the car&#x27;s width to and length to for a lower tax obligation. Particularly in the United States, this narrower model was seen as compromised, thus limiting its sales potential. As a result, the &quot;wide-body&quot; mid-size Camry (XV10) released to North America in 1991 was developed from early 1988 and the final design frozen later that year. It was with the XV10 that Toyota upgraded the Camry&#x27;s status to its second &quot;world car&quot; after the Corolla, with exports starting from Australia to Southeast Asia. Japan also received the wider XV10 model, although it was sold under the Toyota Scepter name there. Toyota chose the name &quot;Scepter&quot; as a reference to the Camry/Crown naming tradition, as a &quot;scepter&quot; is a symbolic ornamental staff held by a ruling monarch, a prominent item of royal regalia.

A notable point of the &quot;Wide body&quot; SXV10 Camry is the influence of engineering developed from the launch of Lexus and the LS400, which came to market just a few years prior to its public debut. The kinship to Lexus models in engineering standards (such as CMM and GD&amp;T development standards) and tolerances on the SXV10 is often perceived to be closer than any prior or latter iterations of the Camry. In an interview with Automotive News, Chris Hostetter, group vice president for Toyota NA, admitted that the 1992 Camry was considered by many company insiders to be more of a &quot;Lexus product&quot; than most Toyota badge cars, going on to mention that it borrowed technologies such as hydraulically powered cooling fans directly developed from the ES300. However, the Lexus standards of the SXV10 created a division in product development philosophies in the company. Also according to Automotive News, some company insiders considered it too upscale for its price point and the market segment it was set to compete within (mid-sized, mid-segment).

It was Robert McCurry in conjunction with Dave Illingworth and Jim Press, who, with great initial opposition from the Japanese executives, convinced the Japanese company that the 1992 Camry be re-designed, enlarged, and shaped to resemble a scaled-down LS400 with a more affordable FWD format, to help establish the reputation of Lexus, which at the time was still in its infancy and lacked brand heritage. The intensive platform and component sharing with the 1992 ES300 allowed Toyota to leverage costs better to allow the SXV10 Camry&#x27;s high level of specification at a reasonable price. The 1992 Camry also took more resemblance to the LS400 in the sloped roofline, wide C pillar and framed windows, where as the ES300 featured a hardtop design with an upgraded/stiffened suspension. However, the LS400 and the SXV10 Camry featured no sharing of powertrain layout nor design. Many insiders of Toyota argued even after critical acclaim that the SXV10 Camry overlapped too greatly with Lexus, even though Chris Hostetter, current vice president of advanced technology research at Toyota, believed the model had to be developed to develop buyers who would become interested in Lexus. This division as well as cost-cutting led to the Camry and Lexus line to become more distinctive, as the Camry became a more economical, affordable, spacious sedan typical of the segment.

The smaller V30 Camry varied in other areas besides the size. Although the underpinnings, doors and fenders, and overall basic design cues were common between the two cars, the smaller Camry sported harder, more angular front- and rear-end styling treatment, with the wide-body model presenting a more curvaceous silhouette. This was a departure from the V20 generation Camry which, although had many more rounded panels than the V10 series, was nevertheless generally slab-sided in shape. A two-door Camry coupé was added to compete with the Honda Accord coupé. However, the Camry Coupé was never popular and was dropped in 1996. A two-door Camry would not be reintroduced until 1999, with the Toyota Camry Solara.

The Japanese V30 model was replaced by the Camry V40 in 1994, however, this was also a Japan-only model. International markets instead retained the wider XV10 until it was replaced by the XV20 in 1996. The V40 and XV20 models were sold alongside one another in the Japanese market until 1998. At this time, the Vista V50 took the place of the V40, ending the period of separate Camrys for the Japanese and international markets.

The XV10, at its most basic level, offered a 2.2-liter &quot;5S-FE&quot; four-cylinder engine, up from 2.0 liters in the V20 and V30 Camrys. This unit produced of power and of torque, although the exact figures varied slightly depending on the market. Power and displacement increases were also received for the V6 engine. The 3.0-liter &quot;3VZ-FE&quot; unit was rated at and . An all-new aluminum &quot;1MZ-FE&quot; V6 debuted in North American models from 1993 for the 1994 model year, with other markets retaining the &quot;3VZ-FE&quot; V6. Power and torque rose to and , respectively.

In Australia, the V6 engine Camry was badged &quot;Camry Vienta&quot; when launched in 1993, later becoming the Toyota Vienta in 1995. In South Africa, the XV10 Camry was manufactured by Toyota SA in Durban from 1992 to 2002, offering both the 2.2-liter and 3.0-liter engines, as well as a 2.0-liter engine derived from the Celica. Only a sedan configuration was available. These were also marketed and sold into Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.

A variant of the UK market V6 model - detuned to run on 91 rather than 95 octane unleaded gasoline - was launched in New Zealand in 1991. These Japanese-built models were replaced with an Australian-made line, with unique New Zealand specification, in 1993 at which point the 2.2-liter I4 was offered as well.

=== XV20 (1996–2002) ===

In late 1991, development on the XV20 commenced after launch of the XV10 under the 415T program. Design work was frozen in early 1994 and later launched in the United States in September 1996 and Japan in December 1996. It continued as a sedan and station wagon (called the Camry Gracia in Japan), though the wagon was not sold in the United States. This was the first generation where it was sold in Japan as the Daihatsu Altis, replacing the Daihatsu Applause.

In August 1999 for the 2000 model year, the sedan models received a mid-model upgrade to the front and rear fascias, but remained otherwise similar to the 1997 to 1999 models.

In the United States, the Camry SE was dropped and the base model was renamed the &quot;CE&quot; for the 1997 model year. Both the &quot;LE&quot; and the &quot;XLE&quot; trims were carried over from the previous series. All trim levels were available with either the 2.2-liter I4 or the 3.0-liter V6 engine except the Solara SLE, which was only available with the V6. TRD offered a supercharger kit for 1997 through to 2000 V6 models raising power to and of torque. A coupe was added in 1999, and then a convertible form in 2000. In contrast to the coupe from the XV10 generation Camrys, the new two-door cars were given a separate nameplate Camry Solara, or simply Solara. They were also a significant styling departure from the sedan. The Solara was available in &quot;SE&quot; and &quot;SLE&quot; trims, corresponding roughly to the sedan&#x27;s LE and XLE trims.

Power was increased slightly to SAE for the 5S-FE 2.2 L I4 and SAE for the 1MZ-FE V6. Manual transmissions (model: S51) were only available on the CE trim level, LE V6, and any Solara model. Camrys and Solaras equipped with the 5S-FE 4 cylinder engine and appropriate trim package received the S51 manual transmission, while those equipped with the 1MZ-FE 6 cylinder engine received the E153 manual transmission.

=== XV30 (2001–2006) ===

;Regular
Released in September 2001 for the 2002 model year, Toyota released the Camry XV30 series as a larger sedan, but without a station wagon for the first time. The wagon&#x27;s demise occurred due to its sales erosion to minivans and crossover SUVs.

Toyota redesigned this series from the ground up for the first time since the launch of the Camry nameplate. Through efficiency gains such as increased computerization, and by having the XV30 ride on the K platform introduced with the Toyota Highlander (XU20) of 2000, Toyota expedited the XV30 production development stage to 26 months, down from 36 months with the XV20. As a consequence, Toyota claimed the XV30 to have cost 30 percent less to design and develop than its predecessor. XV30 also had increased parts content over the XV20, but did not cost any more to manufacture.

Until the 2003 model year, the Camry Solara remained on the XV20 series chassis, and received only minor styling upgrades to the front and rear ends. However, the Solara did receive the same 2.4-liter &quot;2AZ-FE&quot; I4 engine that was available on the Camry sedan. The US received three engine options, a 2.4-liter inline-four, a 3.0-liter V6, and a 3.3-liter version of the same. The 3.3-liter was only available for the Camry&#x27;s sportier &quot;SE&quot; model.

;Prestige
Compared to the international version with a less conservative design (styled by Hiroyuki Metsugi, approved 1999), the Southeast Asian and Taiwanese &quot;prestige&quot; Camry had a different distinctive design with more chrome, larger head lamps and tail lamps and a general greater emphasis on its width.

=== XV40 (2006–2012) ===
;Regular
This generation of Camry saw even greater differentiation between &quot;regular&quot; model sold internationally (including Japan) and the &quot;prestige&quot; Camry sold in the rest of Asia. The regular Camry, fitted with four-cylinder engines sold alongside the V6-engined prestige Camry in Oceania and the Middle East as the Toyota Aurion. Between 2006 and 2010, the regular Camry was also rebadged as the Daihatsu Altis model, which sold alongside the Camry in Japan. The Daihatsu differed only in badging, with no cosmetic changes.

The XV40 Camry was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show alongside a hybrid version and went on sale in March 2006 for the 2007 model year.

Power comes from a choice of four and six-cylinder engines. The 2.4-liter &quot;2AZ-FE&quot; I4 engine was carried over and produced . It came with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5-liter &quot;2GR-FE&quot; V6 in contrast came with a new six-speed automatic and produced .

The Camry was facelifted in early 2009 for the 2010 model year with a redesigned fascia, taillights, and an all-new 2.5-liter &quot;2AR-FE&quot; four-cylinder engine with a new six-speed automatic transmission. The 2.5-liter engine produces for the base, LE, XLE models, and for the SE. Power locks, stability control, traction control and tires () were also made standard for 2010. A six speed manual transmission was available on the base model.

The XV40 series Camry is the first in which the Camry has been available as a gasoline/electric hybrid. The Camry Hybrid uses Toyota&#x27;s second-generation Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) and a &quot;2AZ-FXE&quot; four-cylinder with in conjunction with a electric motor for a combined output of .

;Prestige
The Asian market Camry features different front and rear styling, plus a revised interior. In Asia, the Camry occupied a higher end of the market, priced just below entry-level German luxury models. The Asian Camry lineup includes a 3.5-liter V6 model and is sold as the Toyota Aurion (XV40) in Australia, competing against large Australian sedans like the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore.

=== XV50 (2011–2019) ===


;Regular
The XV50 Camry was produced from 21 August 2011, introduced on 23 August 2011, and began U.S. sales in September 2011. The interior received a major restyling, while the exterior received all-new sheet metal and more angular styling.

The US Camry carried over three different engine choices from the previous model. Starting with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid model rated at , a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine rated at and , and a 3.5-liter V6 rated at and . Power output has been increased mostly by switching to electro-hydraulic power steering. The trim levels include the L, LE, SE, XLE, SE V6, XLE V6, Hybrid LE, Hybrid XLE and for 2014 a Hybrid SE model. All models except for the hybrids are standard with six-speed automatic transmissions. For the first time, the manual transmission was not available. Hybrids are equipped with an eCVT transmission. The SE model gets paddle shifters, and a stiffer suspension. The new model has increased fuel economy due to lighter weight, a sleeker body, and low rolling-resistance tires.

A major facelift released to North America in April 2014 for the 2015 model year updated most of the exterior panels.

The US-built Toyota Camry took the top spot in 2015 and 2016 as the most American-made car with over 75 percent of its parts and manufacturing coming from the United States.

;Prestige
In this generation, the Camry line-up for the Japanese domestic market was reduced to being just a single variant (hybrid only). The Japanese market will now share the same Camry model as the Asian market &quot;prestige&quot; Camry—a design also adopted by the Toyota Aurion (XV50), albeit with minor visual changes. The Brazilian market also carries the Prestige variant instead of the one sold in North America (only in the 3.5L V6 configuration). Prior to the XV50, the Japanese and Brazilian markets wide-body Camry were similar to the US models. The &quot;prestige&quot; Camry was discontinued in Southeast Asia and India in late 2018, but continued to be sold in Vietnam until April 2019.

=== XV70 (2017–2024) ===


The XV70 Camry was introduced at the 2017 North American International Auto Show on 9 January 2017. It was launched in Japan on 10 July 2017, and in Australia on 21 November 2017. North American production started in June 2017, and sales began in late July 2017. It is built on GA-K platform.

Engine choices include a base 2.5 L inline four-cylinder (I4) that now produces in base form ( when equipped with the optional quad exhaust), the same 2.5 L inline four-cylinder (I4) engine with an electric motor (Hybrid) that produces , or the top-of-the-line 3.5 L V6 that produces . In some markets the old 2.5 L 2AR-FE engine is carried over from the previous generation which produces .

The only major components shared with the previous generation are the Toyota emblem on the front grille and rear trunk lid.

=== XV80 (2023–present) ===

The XV80 Camry was unveiled on 14 November 2023 and introduced at the 2023 Los Angeles Auto Show. It is built on the same GA-K platform from its predecessor, retaining the underlying body structure, front doors and roofline.

Unlike the previous generations, the XV80 Camry is not available with a pure gasoline engine for markets like North America and Europe. While the Camry is still assembled in Japan, the XV80 is the first Camry not available in its home market, only being exported to other markets.

== Sales ==
Competing with mainstream and more affordable models in Western markets, for other export markets in Asia and Latin America, the Camry is seen as a luxury car where it sells strongly (and serves as Toyota&#x27;s flagship vehicle along with the Land Cruiser). In the United States, except for 2001, the Camry was the best-selling passenger car from 1997 through 2020, and was the best-selling sedan as of 2024. Despite international success, and early success in Japan, the later wide-body models have been a low-volume model in its home market. However, since the introduction of the XV50 Camry in 2011, sales of the wide-body models in Japan have resurged, thanks, in large part, to the inclusion of Toyota&#x27;s Hybrid Synergy Drive system.

The Camry is also a prolific seller within Australia. The Camry has profited within its medium-sized class, where it has been its best selling since 1993, beating traditional competitors including the Mazda 6, as well as contemporary ones in that of the Ford Mondeo and Skoda Superb. The Middle East, as well as Eastern Europe, each have seen the Camry sell well, with Western Europe previously having small amounts exported.

<text>St Andrews is a town in Victoria, Australia, 52 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. St Andrews recorded a population of 1,186 at the 2021 census.

St Andrews is well known for its alternative market, which is open every Saturday from 8am to 2pm except total fire ban days. It also contains a hotel, primary school, bakery, CFA, general store and the Wadambuk community centre where a mobile library managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library has a regular scheduled stop.

==History==
Originally called Queenstown, the area was surveyed in 1858 and proclaimed a town on 25 February 1861. Located between Panton Hill and Kinglake, by 1865 it was also known as St Andrews, and the presence of large numbers of Scottish miners gave rise to the town being called both ‘Caledonia’ and ‘St Andrews’.

St Andrew Post Office had opened earlier on 1 January 1856 and was renamed St Andrews in 1923.

It experienced population growth during the Victorian gold rush, when prospectors mined the hills around the town. St Andrews was the earliest goldfield in the area and by 1855 there were 3000 miners. The first discovery of gold in Queenstown was recorded in The Herald on 9 and 11 March 1855 and was attributed to a George Boston and two Scotsmen.

===Bushfires===
On 7 February 2009 a major bushfire destroyed houses on Ninks, Muller, Jacksons and Wild Dog Creek Roads, as well as Buttermans Track and Olives Lane. Its progression toward the town centre was halted by a southerly wind change, which saved the rest of the town, but drove the fire front further east, destroying the towns of Kinglake and Marysville.

== Facilities ==
A mobile library service managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library stops weekly at the Wadamuk Community Centre.

<doc id="737607" wikidata="Q1292193" url="?curid=737607" title="Tagline">
<text>In entertainment, a tagline (alternatively spelled tag line) is a short text which serves to clarify a thought for, or is designed with a form of, dramatic effect. Many tagline slogans are reiterated phrases associated with an individual, social group, or product. As a variant of a branding slogan, taglines can be used in marketing materials and advertising.

The idea behind the concept is to create a memorable dramatic phrase that will sum up the tone and premise of an audio/visual product, or to reinforce and strengthen the audience&#x27;s memory of a literary product. Some taglines are successful enough to warrant inclusion in popular culture.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;Tagline&quot;, &quot;tag line&quot;, and &quot;tag&quot; are American terms. In the U.K. they are called &quot;end lines&quot;, &quot;endlines&quot;, or &quot;straplines&quot;. In Belgium they are called &quot;baselines&quot;. In France they are &quot;signatures&quot;. In Germany they are &quot;claims&quot;. In the Netherlands and Italy, they are &quot;pay offs&quot; or &quot;pay-off&quot;.

==Organizational usage==
 may encourage taglines to be used as the conclusion to an introduction by each attendee. The purpose would be to make the introduction and that speaker more memorable in the minds of the other attendees after the meeting is over. Other terms for taglines are &quot;memory hooks&quot; (used by BNI®) and &quot;USP&quot; or &quot;Unique Selling Proposition&quot; which is a more commonly known term.

===Difference from headlines===

The tagline is sometimes confused with a headline because information is only presented with the one or the other. Essentially the headline is linked to the information; Once the information changes, the headline is abandoned in favor of a new one. The tagline is related to the entertainment piece and can, therefore, appear on all the information of that product or manufacturer. It is linked to the piece and not to the concept of a specific event. If the sentence is presented next to a logo, as an integral part, it is likely to be a tagline.

==Function==
A tagline is sometimes used as a supplementary expression in promoting a motion picture or television program. It is an explanatory subtitle, in addition to the actual title, on posters or the CD/DVD packaging of videos and music. Taglines can have an enticing effect and are therefore an important aspect in the marketing of films and television programs. Increasingly also found in the advertising world, taglines are a form of advertising slogan. A tagline for the movie series Star Wars, for example:
: &quot;Tagline&quot;: &quot;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...&quot; – &quot;Star Wars&quot;
: &quot;Effect&quot;: It was a long time ago in a far, far away galaxy ...

===E-texts===
Websites also often have taglines. The Usenet use taglines as short description of a newsgroup. The term is used in computing to represent aphorisms, maxims, graffiti or other slogans.

In electronic texts, a &quot;tag&quot; or &quot;tagline&quot; is short, concise sentences in a row that are used when sending e-mail instead of an electronic signature. The tagline is used in computing with the meaning of a &quot;signature&quot; to be affixed at the end of each message. In the late eighties and early nineties, when the amateur computer network FidoNet began to flourish, the messages that were exchanged between users often had a tag-line, which was no longer than 79 characters, containing a brief phrase (often witty or humorous).

<text>Verein für Bewegungsspiele Stuttgart 1893 e. V. (), commonly known as VfB Stuttgart (), is a German professional sports club based in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg. The club&#x27;s football team is currently part of Germany&#x27;s first division, the Bundesliga. VfB Stuttgart has won the national championship five times, most recently in 2006–07, the DFB-Pokal three times and the UEFA Intertoto Cup a record two times. In the all-time Bundesliga table the club sits in fourth place.

The football team plays its home games at the MHPArena, in the Neckarpark which is located near the Cannstatter Wasen, where the city&#x27;s fall beer festival takes place. Second team side VfB Stuttgart II currently plays in the 3. Liga, which is the highest division allowed for a reserve team. The club&#x27;s junior teams have won the national under 19 championships a record ten times and the national under 17 championships seven times.

A membership-based club with over 100,000 members, VfB is the largest sports club in Baden-Württemberg and the eighth-largest football club in Germany. It has departments for fistball, field hockey, track and field, table tennis, and football referees, all of which compete only at the amateur level. The club also maintains an esports department and a social department, the &quot;VfB-Garde&quot;.

==History==
===Foundation to WWII===
&quot;Verein für Bewegungsspiele Stuttgart&quot; was formed through a 2 April 1912 merger of predecessor sides &quot;Stuttgarter FV&quot; and &quot;FC Krone Cannstatt&quot; following a meeting in the Concordia hotel in Cannstatt. Each of these clubs was made up of school pupils with middle-class roots who learned new sports such as rugby union and football from English expatriates such as William Cail who introduced rugby in 1865.

====FV Stuttgart====

&quot;Stuttgarter Fußballverein&quot; was founded at the Zum Becher hotel in Stuttgart on 9 September 1893. &quot;FV&quot; were initially a rugby club, playing games at Stöckach-Eisbahn before moving to Cannstatter Wasen in 1894. The rugby club established a football section in 1908. The team drew players primarily from local schools, under the direction of teacher Carl Kaufmann, and quickly achieved its first success; in 1909, they were runners-up to &quot;FSV 1897 Hannover&quot; in the national rugby final, losing 6–3. Rugby was soon replaced by association football within the club, as spectators found the game too complicated to follow.

In 1909, &quot;FV&quot; joined the Süddeutschen Fußballverband (South German Football Association), playing in the second tier B-Klasse. In their second season &quot;FV&quot; won a district final against future merger partner &quot;Kronen-Klub Cannstatt&quot; before being defeated by &quot;FV Zuffenhausen&quot; in the county championship that would have seen the side promoted. They eventually advanced to the senior Südkreis-Liga in 1912.

====Kronenclub Cannstatt====

&quot;Cannstatter Fußballklub&quot; was formed as a rugby club in 1890 and also quickly established a football team. This club was dissolved after just a few years of play and the former membership re-organized themselves as &quot;FC Krone Cannstatt&quot; in 1897 to compete as a football-only side. The new team joined the Süddeutschen Fußballverband (SFV) as a second division club and won promotion in 1904. &quot;Krone&quot; possessed their own ground, which still exists today as the home of TSV Münster.

Following the 1912 merger of these two clubs, the combined side played at first in the Kreisliga Württemberg and then in the Bezirksliga Württemberg-Baden, earning a number of top three finishes and claiming a title there in 1927. The club also made several appearances in the final rounds of the SFV in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

===1930s and 1940s===
In 1933, VfB moved to Neckar Stadium, the site of its current ground. German football was re-organized that same year under the Third Reich into sixteen top-flight divisions called Gauligen. Stuttgart played in the Gauliga Württemberg and won division titles in 1935, 1937, 1938, 1940, and 1943 before the Gauliga system collapsed part way through the 1944–45 season due to World War II. The club had an intense rivalry with Stuttgarter Kickers throughout this period.

VfB&#x27;s Gauliga titles earned the team entry to the national playoff rounds, with their best result coming in 1935 when they advanced to the final where they lost 4–6 to defending champions Schalke 04, the dominant side of the era. After a third-place result at the national level in 1937, Stuttgart was not able to advance out of the preliminary rounds in subsequent appearances.

===Successes through the 1950s===

VfB continued to play first division football in the Oberliga Süd, capturing titles in 1946, 1952, and 1954. They made regular appearances in the German championship rounds, emerging as national champions in 1950 and 1952, finishing as runner-up in 1953, and winning two DFB-Pokal titles in 1954 and 1958. The team which won four titles in eight years was led by Robert Schlienz who had lost his left arm in a car crash. Despite these successes, no player from the Stuttgart squad had a place in the team that won the 1954 FIFA World Cup.

===Original Bundesligist===
Due to disappointing results in international competition including the 1958 and 1962 FIFA World Cup, and in response to the growth of professionalism in the sport, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball Bund, or DFB) replaced the regional top flight competitions with a single nationwide professional league in 1963. Stuttgart&#x27;s consistently solid play through the 1950s earned them a place among the 16 clubs that would make up the original Bundesliga. As an amateur organisation, and due to proverbial Swabian austerity, the club hesitated to spend money, and some players continued to work in an everyday job. Throughout the balance of the decade and until the mid-1970s, the club would generally earn mid-table results. One of the few stars of the time was Gilbert Gress from Strasbourg.

In 1973, the team qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time and advanced to the semi-finals of the 1974 tournament where they were eliminated by eventual winners Feyenoord (1–2, 2–2).

===1975–2000: Era of president MV===
VfB Stuttgart was in crisis in the mid-1970s, having missed new trends in football such as club sponsorship. Attempts to catch up with new levels of professionalism by spending money failed. Towards the end of the 1974–75 season, with the team in imminent danger of being relegated to Second Bundesliga, local politician Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder was elected as new president. However, a draw in the final game of the season meant that VfB would be ranked 16th and lose its Bundesliga status. The first season in the second league, considered the worst in its history, ended with VfB being ranked 11th, having even lost a home game against local rival SSV Reutlingen in front of just 1,200 spectators.

With new coach Jürgen Sundermann and new talents like Karlheinz Förster and Hansi Müller (1975/76-1981/82), the team built around Ottmar Hitzfeld scored one hundred goals in 1976–77 and thus returned to the top-flight after just two seasons.

The young team was popular for offensive and high-scoring play, but suffered from lack of experience. At the end of 1977–78, VfB was ranked fourth, but the average attendance of over 53,000 set the league record until the 1990s. In 1978/79 they finished second in the Bundesliga. They made another UEFA Cup semi-final appearance in 1980 and delivered a number of top four finishes on their way to their first Bundesliga title – the club&#x27;s third national title – in the 1983/84 season, now under coach Helmut Benthaus.
In 1986, VfB lost the DFB-Pokal final 2–5 to Bayern Munich. In the 1989 UEFA Cup Final, with Jürgen Klinsmann in their ranks, they lost out to Napoli (1–2, 3–3), where Diego Maradona was playing at the time.

In 1991–92, Stuttgart clinched its fourth title, in one of the closest races in Bundesliga history, finishing ahead of Borussia Dortmund on goal difference. Internationally, they had been eliminated from UEFA Cup play that season (1991–92) after losing their second round match to Spanish side Osasuna (2–3). As national champions, the club qualified to play in the UEFA Champions League in 1992–93, but were eliminated in the first round by Leeds United after a tie-breaking third match in Barcelona which was required due to coach Christoph Daum having substituted a fourth non-German player in the tie&#x27;s second leg.

VfB did not qualify for any European competition again until 1997, by way of their third German Cup win, with coach Joachim Löw. They enjoyed a measure of success on their return, advancing to the 1998 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final in Stockholm, where they lost to Chelsea in what was the penultimate year of the competition. Only one player of the &quot;magic triangle&quot;, captain Krassimir Balakov, remained after Giovane Élber and Fredi Bobic left. Löw&#x27;s contract was not renewed, and he was replaced by Winfried Schäfer, who in turn was sacked after one season.

Stuttgart&#x27;s performance, however, fell off after this as the club earned just mid-table results over the next two seasons despite spending money on the transfer market and having veterans like Balakov.

===2000–2007: The post-MV-era return to success===
Due to high debts and the lack of results, Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder finally resigned from VfB in 2000 to take over offices at the DFB, UEFA, and FIFA. New president Manfred Haas had to renegotiate expensive contracts with players who seldom appeared on the field anyway. As in 1976, when Mayer-Vorfelder had taken over, the team had to be rebuilt by relying on talents from the youth teams. The VfB has Germany&#x27;s most successful program in the German youth Championship.

Coach Ralf Rangnick had started a restructuring of the team that won the Intertoto Cup, but the resulting extra strain of the UEFA Cup participation ended in narrowly escaping from relegation in 2001 by clinching the 15th spot in the league table. Rangnick was replaced by Felix Magath.

With players like Andreas Hinkel, Kevin Kurányi, Timo Hildebrand, and Alexander Hleb earning themselves the nickname &quot;the young and wild&quot; , the club soon re-bounded and finished as Bundesliga runners-up in the 2002–03 season. In July 2003, Erwin Staudt became the new president of the club.

====2003–04 Champions League====
VfB qualified for their second Champions League appearance for 2003–04, beating Manchester United and Rangers once and Panathinaikos twice to advance from the group stage as runners-up to Manchester United. They were then matched against Chelsea in the round of 16, falling 0–1 and 0–0 over two legs.

Stuttgart continued to play as one of the top teams in the country, earning fourth and fifth place Bundesliga finishes in 2003–04 and 2004–05 respectively, and again taking part in the UEFA Cup, but without great success. In addition, coach Magath and several players left for another clubs: Kevin Kurányi for Schalke 04, Philipp Lahm for Bayern Munich and Alexander Hleb for Arsenal.

Halfway through the disappointing 2005–06 season, Giovanni Trapattoni was sacked and replaced by Armin Veh. The new coach was designated as a stop-gap due to having resigned from Hansa Rostock in 2003 to focus on his family and having no football job since 2004, save for coaching his home team FC Augsburg for one season. Supported by new manager Horst Heldt, Veh could establish himself and his concept of focusing on promising inexpensive players rather than established stars. Team captain, Zvonimir Soldo, retired, and other veterans left the team that slipped to ninth place and did not qualify for European competition for the first time in four years.

====Bundesliga champions 2006–07====

Despite early-season losses and ensuing criticism in 2006–07, including a 3–0 loss at home to 1. FC Nürnberg, Veh managed to turn the collection of new players like Mexicans Pável Pardo, and Ricardo Osorio, Brazilian Antônio da Silva and fresh local talents, including Mario Gómez, Serdar Tasci, and Sami Khedira, into a strong contender that led the league on 12 November 2006 for the first time in two years. Stuttgart established themselves among the top five and delivered a strong challenge for the Bundesliga title by winning their final eight games. In the penultimate week on 12 May 2007, Stuttgart beat VfL Bochum 3–2 away from home, taking the Bundesliga lead from Schalke 04 and at minimum securing a spot in the 2007–08 Champions League. After trailing 0–1 in the final match of the season against Energie Cottbus, Stuttgart came back to win 2–1 and claim their first Bundesliga title in 15 years. The victory celebrations in Stuttgart, totalling 250,000 people, even topped those of Germany&#x27;s third place win over Portugal in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

In addition, VfB had their first ever chance to win the double as they also reached the final of the German Cup for the first time since their victory there ten years former. Their opponents in the cup final in Berlin were 1. FC Nürnberg, a team that had beaten them twice by three goals in regular season, 3–0 and 4–1, and had last won the cup in 1962. With the game level at 1–1 in the first half, Stuttgart&#x27;s scorer Cacau was sent off. Nürnberg gained a 2–1 lead early in the second half, but the ten men of VfB managed to fight back and equalize. In the second half of extra time, however, with both teams suffering from exhaustion and the humid conditions, Nürnberg scored the winning goal.

===2007 to 2018: Decline and two relegations===
====2007–08 UEFA Champions League====
The 2007–08 UEFA Champions League draw on 30 August 2007 paired the German champions with Spanish giants Barcelona, French champions Lyon and Scottish Old Firm side Rangers. Like in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League season, Stuttgart&#x27;s 2007–08 European campaign started with a match at Ibrox Park in Glasgow against Rangers. It ended in a 2–1 defeat. The second match at home against Barcelona was likewise lost, 0–2, as well as the third match, against Lyon at home, with the visitors coming out 2–0 winners from two-second-half strikes. Five defeats and just one win (over Rangers) meant the early exit on the European stage. In the league, they managed to finish in sixth place after a poor start. New German international star Mario Gómez scored 19 goals.

Subsequently, UEFA Cup qualification was ensured in the summer by succeeding in the 2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

====Post-championship seasons 2008–12====

The 2008–09 season, like the one before it, got off to a bad start. After matchday 14 in November, VfB was only 11th in the table and as a result, Armin Veh was sacked and replaced by Markus Babbel. After exiting the German Cup after a 1–5 thrashing from Bayern Munich in January, prospects improved considerably and the team ended third in the table, with second place just being missed after a loss to Bayern on the last matchday. That meant the chance of making the Champions League again.

Internationally, VfB mastered the group stages of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, but lost to Cup defenders Zenit Saint Petersburg in the round of the last 32 in February.

Stuttgart went into the 2009–10 season with Mario Gómez leaving for Bayern Munich, just as Pavel Pogrebnyak arrived from Zenit Saint Petersburg and Alexander Hleb returning on loan from Barcelona.

On the European level, Stuttgart started the season with a huge success by qualifying for the group stage of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League. Stuttgart entered that competition for the third time in six years (after 2003 and 2007) by defeating Romanian side Politehnica Timișoara in the Champions League play-off round on 18 and 26 August 2009. VfB were then drawn into Group G against Spanish side Sevilla, Scottish champions Rangers, against whom they had also been drawn against in their previous two Champions League Group stage appearances, and Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni. With two wins (one each against Rangers and Unirea), three draws (one each against all opponents) and a loss (to Sevilla) they managed second spot in the group, thus qualifying for the round of the last 16, where they had to face title holders Barcelona in late winter. After a superb home game against Barça which Stuttgart, however, did not manage to win (1–1), they were eliminated in a 4–0 rout at Camp Nou.

In the 2009–10 DFB-Pokal, they did not proceed further than the last 16 either, losing to second-tier side SpVgg Greuther Fürth. That defeat came in the course of a disappointing first half of the 2009–10 Bundesliga. As a consequence of slipping to 16th spot in December, young coach Markus Babbel was fired after matchday 15 and replaced by the more experienced Swiss Christian Gross. Under his tenure, VfB improved their situation domestically as well as internationally before the winter break. During that break, Thomas Hitzlsperger, Jan Šimák and Ludovic Magnin left the club; Cristian Molinaro was loaned out from Juventus. In the later half of the season, the team – as in the 2008–09 season – had a fantastic, almost unbroken, winning streak. As the best team of that second (return) round of the Bundesliga, the Swabians under Gross climbed into the upper half of the table and, after a sensational rally, eventually managed to secure European football for the following season by qualifying for the Europa League.

The 2010–11 season was a mediocre one—after again spending the first half of the season almost always in the relegation zone (17th and 18th spot), with Christian Gross being fired and interim coach Jens Keller taking over for the rest of the first leg, Bruno Labbadia was hired as new coach in January and managed to save VfB from relegation. Eventually, the team finished 12th after a decent second-half performance. In July 2011, Erwin Staudt did not participate again in the election of the president and Gerd E. Mäuser was elected as president.

In the following 2011–12 season, they managed to constantly climb up the table; this was especially thanks to a long unbeaten streak in the spring. Subsequently, VfB qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League. Key players during that season were Martin Harnik, who scored 17 goals, as well as winger Gōtoku Sakai and forward Vedad Ibišević, who both came to Stuttgart in January 2012.
With effect from 3 June 2013, Gerd E. Mäuser announced his resignation as president of VfB Stuttgart. On 2 July 2013, the supervisory board of the club named Bernd Wahler as the candidate for the presidential elections. On 22 July 2013, Wahler was elected by 97.4% of the votes cast.

After barely avoiding relegation from the Bundesliga in the 2014–15 season, Stuttgart were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga in the 2015–16 season after finishing in 17th place, having been unable to lift themselves out of the bottom three positions until the end of the season. Following matchday 13, a home match against FC Augsburg and their second consecutive 4–0 loss, Stuttgart decided to terminate Alexander Zorniger&#x27;s contract and appointed Jürgen Kramny as their manager for an indefinite period. After Stuttgart were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga, Wahler resigned as president on 15 May 2016. Kramny was subsequently sacked as coach.

On 17 May 2016, Jos Luhukay was announced as the new head coach. In July 2016, Jan Schindelmeiser became the sporting director and member of the executive board. Head coach Luhukay resigned on 15 September 2016 and was replaced by Hannes Wolf. At the end of the season, Stuttgart returned to the Bundesliga as the 2. Bundesliga champions. On 22 December 2017, after nearly 10 years since his departure, Bundesliga title winning striker Mario Gomez returned to the team from fellow Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, The team made a solid return season to the Bundesliga, finishing in 7th place. However, they slumped to 16th the following season, eventually ending up relegated via play-offs against Union Berlin.

===2019–present: Re-emergence and the runner-up position===

Stuttgart appointed Thomas Hitzlsperger as the sporting CEO, and in April they appointed Sven Mislintat as the sporting director, coming from Borussia Dortmund and Arsenal. In July 2019, Stuttgart was relegated to the second division, and started to rebuild the team. In mid-season, December 2019, former coach Tim Walter was fired and Pellegrino Matarazzo was signed. After one season, Stuttgart returned to the Bundesliga after finishing second in the 2019–20 2. Bundesliga season. In 2020, the contract of Mislintat was prolonged to give him more responsibility.

Stuttgart stayed in the Bundesliga in the 2020–21 season, finishing in ninth place in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bundesliga Tabelle 2020/21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2021–22 season, the team narrowly avoided relegation; a last-minute-win against 1. FC Köln on the last match day guaranteed them a spot in the first league for a third consecutive season. In the 2022–23 season, Stuttgart managed to stay in the Bundesliga for a fourth consecutive season, but again only very closely, with Stuttgart finishing in 16th place and only qualifying for the next season thanks to successful play-offs.

The 2023–24 season for Stuttgart has been one of the most successful ones of the club&#x27;s history. Stuttgart was frequently called &quot;the surprise team of the season&quot;. In Bundesliga, they played their best season ever based on the number and rate of victories. They remained in 3rd place of the Bundesliga for most of the matchdays, only behind Leverkusen and Bayern, until they surpassed Bayern Munich on the final matchday to finish as Bundesliga runners-up. It was the club&#x27;s best performance since winning the league in 2007. They also reached the quarter-finals in the DFB Pokal, where they defeated 1. FC Union Berlin and Borussia Dortmund before losing to eventual winners Bayer Leverkusen 3–2. Strikers Serhou Guirassy and Deniz Undav were among the top goalscorers worldwide, with Guirassy even breaking the all-time Stuttgart record of most goals in a season despite missing some games. Deniz Undav, Alexander Nübel, Chris Führich, Maximilian Mittelstädt and Waldemar Anton were nominated for the preliminary squad of the Germany national team for the UEFA Euro 2024, a club record high for number of players ever selected from the club in a major tournament.

==Stadium==
The home ground of VfB Stuttgart is the MHPArena which was originally built in 1933. It lies close to the River Neckar on Bad Cannstatt&#x27;s Mercedesstraße near the new Mercedes-Benz Museum and Mercedes-Benz factory. After being renovated several times, the stadium was able to hold a maximum capacity of 55,896 spectators (50,000 for international matches). For the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion (its original name) was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, hosting five preliminary round matches, a first knockout round match (England vs. Ecuador) and the third place play-off (Germany vs. Portugal). From the 2008–09 season, the stadium was named the Mercedes-Benz-Arena, starting with a pre-season friendly against Arsenal on 30 July 2008. The stadium recently went through extensive restructuring and rebuilding as it was being converted into a pure football arena. In 2011, the capacity was increased to 60,449.

==Rivalries, friendships and cooperations==

The longest rivalry of VfB is the city rivalry with Stuttgarter Kickers (&quot;Die Roten&quot;/&quot;Reds&quot; against &quot;Die Blauen&quot;/&quot;Blues&quot;). However, the respective first teams of the two clubs have not played each other since Kickers were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga in 1992. Thus, this derby has increasingly been overtaken in importance by the Baden-Württemberg-Derby between VfB and Karlsruher SC. In this derby, old Badenese-Württembergian animosities are played out. The rivalry with Bavarian side Bayern Munich (&quot;Süd-/South Derby&quot;) is mainly one-sided, as VfB fans maintain animosity towards Bayern for buying some of Stuttgart&#x27;s best players and coaches in recent years, such as Giovane Élber, Felix Magath, Mario Gómez, and Benjamin Pavard.

Regional friendships exist between VfB and the South Württemberg side SSV Reutlingen 05 (the &quot;little brother&quot; of VfB) as well as with North Württembergers SpVgg Ludwigsburg but also with Heidenheim FC Heidenheim. On a national level, supporters groups of VfB used to be closely connected with those of Energie Cottbus, 1. FC Saarbrücken, Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt. All of these supporter group friendships have been discontinued by today or are only maintained by few supporter groups. Current ultras friendships are with the ultras of SSV Reutlingen 05 and Italian club Cesena.

In 2005, a cooperation treaty between VfB and Swiss Super League side St. Gallen was signed, with particular emphasis on the youth sectors of both clubs.

<doc id="737610" wikidata="Q718694" url="?curid=737610" title="Exploding whale">
<text>There have been several cases of exploding whale carcasses due to a buildup of gas in the decomposition process. This can occur when a whale strands itself ashore. Actual explosives have also been used to assist in disposing of whale carcasses, ordinarily after towing the carcass out to sea, and as part of a beach cleaning effort. It was reported as early as 1928, when an attempt to preserve a carcass failed due to faulty chemical usages.

A widely reported case of an exploding whale occurred in Florence, Oregon, in November 1970, when the Oregon Highway Division (now the Oregon Department of Transportation) blew up a decaying sperm whale with dynamite in an attempt to dispose of its rotting carcass. The explosion threw whale flesh around away, and its odor lingered for some time. American humorist Dave Barry wrote about it in his newspaper column in 1990 after viewing television footage of the explosion, and later the same footage from news station KATU circulated on the Internet. It was also parodied in the 2007 American film &quot;Reno 911!: Miami&quot;, the 2018 Australian film &quot;Swinging Safari&quot;, and the 2010 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;The Squirt and the Whale&quot;. It has since been honored by the Eugene Emeralds of Minor League Baseball in 2023.

An example of a spontaneously bursting whale carcass occurred in Taiwan in 2004, when the buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale caused it to burst in a crowded urban area while it was being transported for a post-mortem examination. Other cases, natural and artificial, have also been reported in Canada, South Africa, Iceland, Australia, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. Artificial explosions have also been imposed by governments, and approved by the International Whaling Commission in emergency situations. However, it has also been criticized for its long-lasting odor.

==United States==
===Florence whale===

On November 9, 1970, a sperm whale washed ashore at Florence on the central Oregon Coast. The weight of the carcass was estimated at . At the time, Oregon beaches were under the jurisdiction of the state&#x27;s Highway Division, which, after consulting with the United States Navy, decided to remove the whale using dynamiteassuming that the resulting pieces would be small enough for scavenger animals to consume.

George Thornton, the engineer in charge of the operation, told an interviewer that he was not sure how much dynamite would be needed, saying that he had been chosen to remove the whale because his supervisor had gone hunting. A charge of  of dynamite was selected. A military veteran with explosives training who happened to be in the area warned that the planned twenty cases of dynamite was far too much, and that 20 sticks () would have sufficed, but his advice went unheeded.

The dynamite was detonated on November 12 at 3:45p.m. A cameraman, Doug Brazil, filmed it for a story by news reporter Paul Linnman of KATU-TV in Portland, Oregon. In his voice-over, Linnman joked that &quot;land-lubber newsmen&quot; became &quot;land- newsmen[...] for the blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds&quot;. The explosion caused large pieces of blubber to land near buildings and in parking lots some distance away from the beach. Only some of the whale was disintegrated; most of it remained on the beach for the Oregon Highway Division workers to clear away. In his report, Linnman also noted that scavenger birds, who it had been hoped would eat the remains of the carcass after the explosion, did not appear as they were possibly scared away by the noise.

The explosives-expert veteran&#x27;s brand-new automobile, purchased during a &quot;Get a Whale of a Deal&quot; promotion in a nearby city, was damaged by a chunk of falling blubber.

Ending his story, Linnman noted that &quot;It might be concluded that, should a whale ever be washed ashore in Lane County again, those in charge will not only remember what to do, they&#x27;ll certainly remember what to do&quot;. When 41 sperm whales beached nearby in 1979, state parks officials burned and buried them.

Later that day, Thornton told the Eugene &quot;Register-Guard&quot;, &quot;It went just exactly right.[...] Except the blast funneled a hole in the sand under the whale&quot; and that some of the whale chunks were subsequently blown back toward the onlookers and their cars.

Thornton was promoted to the Medford office several months after the incident, and served in that post until his retirement. When Linnman contacted him in the mid-1990s, the newsman said Thornton felt the operation had been an overall success and had been converted into a public-relations disaster by hostile media reports.

The Siuslaw Pioneer Museum has bone fragments of the Florence exploding whale, called &quot;Florence&#x27;s most infamous moment&quot; by local press. Currently, Oregon State Parks Department policy is to bury whale carcasses where they land. If the sand is not deep enough, they are relocated to another beach.

====Renewed interest====
The story was brought to widespread public attention by writer Dave Barry in his &quot;Miami Herald&quot; column of May 20, 1990, when he reported that he possessed footage of the event. Barry wrote: &quot;Here at the institute we watch it often, especially at parties.&quot; Some time later, the Oregon State Highway division started to receive calls from the media after a shortened version of the article was distributed on bulletin boards under the title &quot;&quot;The Far Side&quot; Comes to Life in Oregon&quot;. The unattributed copy of Barry&#x27;s article did not explain that the event had happened approximately 25 years earlier. Barry later said that, on a fairly regular basis, someone would forward him his own column and suggest he write something about the described incident. As a result of these omissions, an article in the ODOT&#x27;s &quot;TranScript&quot; notes that:

The KATU footage resurfaced later as a video file on several websites, becoming a viral video. A 2006 study found that the video had been viewed 350million times across various websites. In 2020, residents of Florence voted to name a new recreational area &quot;Exploding Whale Memorial Park&quot; in honor of the incident; it also has a memorial plaque. For the 50th anniversary of the event, KATU pulled the original 16 mm footage from the archives and released a remastered edition of the news report in 4K resolution. Commemorating the anniversary as well, locals were reported to visit the beach and dress as whales.

Florence celebrates Exploding Whale Day annually at Exploding Whale Memorial Park. In 2024, the public was invited to build an altar for the exploded whale.

==Taiwan==
Another whale explosion occurred on January 29, 2004, in Tainan City, Taiwan. This time the explosion resulted from the buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale, which caused it to burst. The cause of the phenomenon was initially unknown, since it occurred in the spinal area of the whale, not in its abdomen as might be expected. It was later determined that the whale had most likely been struck by a large shipping vessel, damaging its spine and weakening the area, and leading to its death. The whale died after beaching on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, and it took three large cranes and 50 workers more than 13 hours to shift the whale onto the back of a truck.

&quot;Taiwan News&quot; reported that, while the whale was being moved, &quot;a large crowd of more than 600 local Yunlin residents and curiosity seekers, along with vendors selling snack food and hot drinks, braved the cold temperature and chilly wind to watch workmen try to haul away the dead marine leviathan&quot;. Professor Wang Chien-ping had ordered the whale be moved to the Sutsao Wild Life Reservation Area after he had been refused permission to perform a necropsy at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan. When it burst, the whale carcass was on the back of a truck near the center of Tainan, &quot;en route&quot; from the university laboratory to the preserve. The bursting whale splattered blood and entrails over surrounding shop fronts, bystanders, and cars. The explosion did not, however, cause injuries or prevent researchers from performing a necropsy on the animal.

Over the course of about a year, Wang completed a bone display from the remains of the whale. The assembled specimen and some preserved organs and tissues have been on display in the Taijiang Cetacean Museum since April 8, 2005.

==Others==

* In 1928, entrepreneurs Harold L. Anfenger and M. C. Hutton accidentally exploded a whale carcass they were attempting to preserve for a sideshow when the embalmer they had hired badly misjudged the balance of salt and formaldehyde necessary to preserve the specimen.
* Whale corpses are regularly disposed of using explosives; however, the whales are usually first towed out to sea. Government-sanctioned explosions have occurred in South Africa, Iceland, and Australia.
* A number of controlled explosions have been made in South Africa. Explosives were used to kill a beached humpback whale west of Port Elizabeth on August 6, 2001, while a southern right whale that beached near Cape Town on September 15, 2005, was killed by authorities through detonation. In the latter instance, the authorities stated that the whale could not have been saved, and that the use of explosives in such cases was recommended by the International Whaling Commission. A few weeks after the Port Elizabeth explosion, the carcass of a second humpback was dragged out to sea and explosives were used to break it into pieces so it would not pose a hazard to shipping. Yet another explosion was performed in Bonza Bay on September 20, 2004, when an adult humpback whale died after beaching itself. In order to sink the whale, authorities towed it out to sea, affixed explosives to it, and set them off from a distance.
*A whale carcass adrift in the Icelandic harbour of Hafnarfjörður was split in two by a controlled explosion on June 5, 2005. The remains were dragged out to sea; however, they soon drifted back, and eventually had to be tied down.
* On September 2, 2010, a humpback whale that had been stranded for two weeks near the Western Australian city of Albany was killed by the Department of Environment and Conservation using explosives. The department had planned to let the whale die of natural causes, but decided to kill the animal with explosives after it repositioned itself on a sandbar.
* A sperm whale carcass burst in Við Áir, Faroe Islands, on November 26, 2013, when measures were taken to avoid a larger burst by perforating its skin. Footage of the incident was shown on Kringvarp Føroya, the national Faroese broadcaster.
* In April 2014, officials in Trout River, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, expressed concern that the carcass of a blue whale which had washed ashore might burst, as it had expanded to twice its normal size from trapped gas.
* One of three sperm whales that died after becoming beached on the Lincolnshire coast near Skegness, United Kingdom in January 2016 burst due to a build-up of gases in the carcass, after a marine biologist cut into it while trying to perform a post-mortem. The bursting caused a &quot;huge blast of air&quot;.

<doc id="737613" wikidata="Q5326244" url="?curid=737613" title="Earl of Darlington">
<text>Earl of Darlington is a title that has been created twice, each time in the Peerage of Great Britain. Baroness von Kielmansegg, half-sister of King George I, was made countess of Darlington in 1722. This creation was for life only, and so the title expired on her death in 1725.

The second creation came in 1754 in favour of Henry Vane, 3rd Baron Barnard, who became the first Earl of Darlington.
*Henry Vane, 1st Earl of Darlington (c. 1705–1758)
*Henry Vane, 2nd Earl of Darlington (1726–1792)
*William Harry Vane, 3rd Earl of Darlington (1766–1842)

In 1827 Lord Darlington was created Marquess of Cleveland and in 1833 Duke of Cleveland.
*William Harry Vane, 1st Duke of Cleveland (1766–1842)
*Henry Vane, 2nd Duke of Cleveland (1788–1864)
*William John Frederick Vane, 3rd Duke of Cleveland (1792–1864)
*Harry George Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland (1803–1891)

== Family tree ==
==In fiction==
The Earl of Darlington was a character in Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s novel &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;. He was the lord of Darlington Hall. Among his employees were the butler Stevens, his father and the housekeeper Miss Kenton. During the 1930s, the Earl hosted numerous conferences and secret meetings between Germany, the United Kingdom, and other European powers in Darlington Hall. The Germans manipulated the Earl so that he persuaded the British government to negotiate the appeasement peace treaty in its favour, which eventually resulted in the outbreak of the Second World War. The Earl died in the early 1950s. Afterwards, his heirs auctioned off Darlington Hall and all of its belongings in order to raise money to pay for death duties and other taxes.

The novel was adapted into a 1993 film by Merchant Ivory Productions starring Anthony Hopkins as Stevens and Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton. Lord Darlington was played by James Fox.

<text>The GABA receptors are a class of receptors that respond to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the chief inhibitory compound in the mature vertebrate central nervous system. There are two classes of GABA receptors: GABAA and GABAB. GABAA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels (also known as ionotropic receptors); whereas GABAB receptors are G protein-coupled receptors, also called metabotropic receptors.

==Ligand-gated ion channels==

===GABAA receptor===
It has long been recognized that, for neurons that are stimulated by bicuculline and picrotoxin, the fast inhibitory response to GABA is due to direct activation of an anion channel. This channel was subsequently termed the GABAA receptor. Fast-responding GABA receptors are members of a family of Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels. Members of this superfamily, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, GABAA receptors, glycine and 5-HT3 receptors, possess a characteristic loop formed by a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues.

In ionotropic GABAA receptors, binding of GABA molecules to their binding sites in the extracellular part of the receptor triggers opening of a chloride ion-selective pore. The increased chloride conductance drives the membrane potential towards the reversal potential of the Cl¯ ion which is about –75 mV in neurons, inhibiting the firing of new action potentials. This mechanism is responsible for the sedative effects of GABAA allosteric agonists. In addition, activation of GABA receptors lead to the so-called shunting inhibition, which reduces the excitability of the cell independent of the changes in membrane potential.

There have been numerous reports of excitatory GABAA receptors. According to the excitatory GABA theory, this phenomenon is due to increased intracellular concentration of Cl¯ ions either during development of the nervous system or in certain cell populations. After this period of development, a chloride pump is upregulated and inserted into the cell membrane, pumping Cl− ions into the extracellular space of the tissue. Further openings via GABA binding to the receptor then produce inhibitory responses. Over-excitation of this receptor induces receptor remodeling and the eventual invagination of the GABA receptor. As a result, further GABA binding becomes inhibited and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are no longer relevant.

However, the excitatory GABA theory has been questioned as potentially being an artefact of experimental conditions, with most data acquired in in-vitro brain slice experiments susceptible to un-physiological milieu such as deficient energy metabolism and neuronal damage. The controversy arose when a number of studies have shown that GABA in neonatal brain slices becomes inhibitory if glucose in perfusate is supplemented with ketone bodies, pyruvate, or lactate, or that the excitatory GABA was an artefact of neuronal damage. Subsequent studies from originators and proponents of the excitatory GABA theory have questioned these results, but the truth remained elusive until the real effects of GABA could be reliably elucidated in intact living brain. Since then, using technology such as in-vivo electrophysiology/imaging and optogenetics, two in-vivo studies have reported the effect of GABA on neonatal brain, and both have shown that GABA is indeed overall inhibitory, with its activation in the developing rodent brain not resulting in network activation, and instead leading to a decrease of activity.

GABA receptors influence neural function by coordinating with glutamatergic processes.

===GABAA-ρ receptor===
A subclass of ionotropic GABA receptors, insensitive to typical allosteric modulators of GABAA receptor channels such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, was designated GABAС receptor. Native responses of the GABAC receptor type occur in retinal bipolar or horizontal cells across vertebrate species.

GABAС receptors are exclusively composed of ρ (rho) subunits that are related to GABAA receptor subunits. Although the term &quot;GABAС receptor&quot; is frequently used, GABAС may be viewed as a variant within the GABAA receptor family. Others have argued that the differences between GABAС and GABAA receptors are large enough to justify maintaining the distinction between these two subclasses of GABA receptors. However, since GABAС receptors are closely related in sequence, structure, and function to GABAA receptors and since other GABAA receptors besides those containing ρ subunits appear to exhibit GABAС pharmacology, the Nomenclature Committee of the IUPHAR has recommended that the GABAС term no longer be used and these ρ receptors should be designated as the ρ subfamily of the GABAA receptors (GABAA-ρ).

==G protein-coupled receptors==

===GABAB receptor===
A slow response to GABA is mediated by GABAB receptors, originally defined on the basis of pharmacological properties.

In studies focused on the control of neurotransmitter release, it was noted that a GABA receptor was responsible for modulating evoked release in a variety of isolated tissue preparations. This ability of GABA to inhibit neurotransmitter release from these preparations was not blocked by bicuculline, was not mimicked by isoguvacine, and was not dependent on Cl¯, all of which are characteristic of the GABAA receptor. The most striking discovery was the finding that baclofen (β-parachlorophenyl GABA), a clinically employed muscle relaxant mimicked, in a stereoselective manner, the effect of GABA.

Later ligand-binding studies provided direct evidence of binding sites for baclofen on central neuronal membranes. cDNA cloning confirmed that the GABAB receptor belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors. Additional information on GABAB receptors has been reviewed elsewhere.

== GABA receptor gene polymorphisms ==
Two separate genes on two chromosomes control GABA synthesis - glutamate decarboxylase and alpha-ketoglutarate decarboxylase genes - though not much research has been done to explain this polygenic phenomenon. GABA receptor genes have been studied more in depth, and many have hypothesized about the deleterious effects of polymorphisms in these receptor genes. The most common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in GABA receptor genes rho 1, 2, and 3 (GABBR1, GABBR2, and GABBR3) have been more recently explored in literature, in addition to the potential effects of these polymorphisms. However, some research has demonstrated that there is evidence that these polymorphisms caused by single base pair variations may be harmful.

It was discovered that the minor allele of a single nucleotide polymorphism at GABBR1 known as rs1186902 is significantly associated with a later age of onset for migraines, but for the other SNPs, no differences were discovered between genetic and allelic variations in the control vs. migraine participants. Similarly, in a study examining SNPs in rho 1, 2, and 3, and their implication in essential tremor, a nervous system disorder, it was discovered that there were no differences in the frequencies of the allelic variants of polymorphisms for control vs. essential tremor participants. On the other hand, research examining the effect of SNPs in participants with restless leg syndrome found an &quot;association between GABRR3rs832032 polymorphism and the risk for RLS, and a modifier effect of GABRA4 rs2229940 on the age of onset of RLS&quot; - the latter of which is a modifier gene polymorphism. The most common GABA receptor SNPs do not correlate with deleterious health effects in many cases, but do in a few.

One significant example of a deleterious mutation is the major association between several GABA receptor gene polymorphisms and schizophrenia. Because GABA is integral to the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters which produce a calming effect and play a role in reducing anxiety, stress, and fear, it is not surprising that polymorphisms in these genes result in more consequences relating to mental health than to physical health. Of an analysis on 19 SNPs on various GABA receptor genes, five SNPs in the GABBR2 group were found to be significantly associated with schizophrenia, which produce the unexpected haplotype frequencies not found in the studies mentioned previously.

Several studies have verified association between alcohol use disorder and the rs279858 polymorphism on the GABRA2 gene e, and higher negative alcohol effects scores for individuals who were homozygous at six SNPs. Furthermore, a study examining polymorphisms in the GABA receptor beta 2 subunit gene found an association with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and examined three SNPs and their effects on disease frequency and treatment dosage. A major finding of this study was that functional psychosis should be conceptualized as a scale of phenotypes rather than distinct categories.

<doc id="737622" wikidata="Q576319" url="?curid=737622" title="Acharnae">
<text>Acharnae or Acharnai (; ) was a &quot;deme&quot; of ancient Athens. It was part of the phyle Oineis.

Acharnae, according to Thucydides, was the largest deme in Attica. In the fourth century BCE, 22 of the 500 members of the Athenian council came from Acharnae, more than from any other deme.

==Name==
The place-name of Acharnae is most likely pre-Greek in origin, similar to other place-names throughout Attica. During antiquity it was believed that the name originated from the word () or (), meaning seabass, due to the shape of the plain that Acharnae was in looking like a fish. Another view was that the name originated from Acharnas, one of the mythical heroes from Attica and the supposed founder of the city.

==Location==
Acharnae was located in the west-northwest part of the Attic plain, 60 stadia north of Athens, south of Mount Parnes. The site of Acharnae is located at and southwest of Menidi (renamed to modern Acharnes). It was from the woods of this mountain that the Acharnians were enabled to carry on that traffic in charcoal for which they were noted among the Athenians. Their land was fertile; their population was rough and warlike; and they furnished at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War 3,000 hoplites, or a tenth of the whole infantry of the republic. They possessed sanctuaries or altars of Apollo Aguieus, of Heracles, of Athena Hygieia, of Athena Hippia, of Dionysus Melpomenus, and of Dionysus Cissus, so called, because the Acharnians said that the ivy first grew in this deme. One of the plays of Aristophanes bears the name of the Acharnians.

==History==
The oldest confirmed evidence of permanent inhabitation in the area dates from the Neolithic.

During the Mycenaean period in the Greek Bronze Age the area was continuously inhabited. Near the neighbourhood of Lykopetra a Mycenaean tholos tomb has been discovered, while traces of another Bronze Age tomb have been found in the area today called Nemesis. Many archaeological reports claim several tomb excavations across the entirety of the area, which all point to the possibility of Acharnae possibly being a politically independent region during the period.

The largest amount of archaeological evidence dates from the Classical and Hellenistic periods (5th - 2nd centuries BCE). It consists mostly of graveyards found throughout the entire area, parts of the ancient deme&#x27;s road network, as well as parts of hydraulic infrastructure from the 4th century BCE. A lot of information is given about the public and private life of the locals during the period by the remnants of the road networks.

In the first phase of the Peloponnesian War the Lacedaemonian (Spartan) army invaded the Athenian home-region of Attica under the command of king Archidamos II, advancing up to Acharnae as the statesman Pericles gathered the citizens of Attica inside the walls of Athens. The Spartan army ravaged the deme and its forestry, setting a series of camps within it, hoping to draw out the Athenians to a pitched battle where the Spartans would have the upper hand. The total destruction of Acharnae and the abandonment of the temple of Ares, a sanctuary of great importance in the deme, led to the warlike depiction of its citizens. Notably, Aristophanes depicted the Acharnians in his work Lysistrata as violent raiders. According to Thucydides the deme offered an army of 3,000 hoplites, 1/10 of the total Athenian army, although this information is believed by historians to be mistaken - there was an analogy of 42 free citizens for every politician of a deme according to the Athenian constitution, thus the number of hoplites Acharnae could offer was only 1,000.

In the aftermath of the Peloponnesian war and during the Athenian civil war, a large battle was commenced in the area between the democratic rebels of Thrasybulus and the forces of the Thirty Tyrants imposed by Sparta. Thrasybulus clashed with all the city&#x27;s Spartan guard with a force of only 700 men and 2 cavalry divisions attempting to cut off supplies. The battle was victorious for the democrats, who drove away the enemy and slew about 120 of them.

==Economy==
The Acharnians chiefly grew cereals, grapes, and olives. Acharnae was the centre of the Athenian charcoal-burning industry, and the chorus of Aristophanes&#x27; comedy &quot;The Acharnians&quot; is made up of charcoal-burners. Pindar characterizes them as notably brave. A tholos tomb at Menidi suggests Acharnae was once an independent entity; a temple to Ares was later moved to the Athenian Agora.

Donkeys from Acharnae were noted for their large size, perhaps in humor. Peisander the oligarch (), a native of the &quot;deme&quot;, was nicknamed (&quot;donkey&quot;) for at least that reason.

<text>Waldo Peirce (December 17, 1884 – March 8, 1970) was an American painter, who for many years reveled in living the life of a bohemian expatriate.

Peirce was both a prominent painter and a well-known colorful figure in the world of the arts. In a modern account, he was described as Rabelaisian, bawdy, witty, robust, wild, lusty, protean, lecherous, luscious, and was sometimes called &quot;the American Renoir.&quot; Peirce once said he never worked a day in his life. He did, however, spend many hours every day for 50 years of his life painting still lifes, figures, and landscapes as well as hundreds of pictures of his beloved families (he was married four times and had numerous children). With a mustache and full beard and a large cigar jammed perpetually into his mouth he looked every inch of a cartoonist&#x27;s notion of an artist. Peirce himself was adamant about one thing: &quot;I&#x27;m a painter,&quot; he insisted, &quot;not an artist.&quot; 

==Biography==
Waldo Peirce was born December 17, 1884, in Bangor, Maine, to Mellen Chamberlain Peirce and Anna Hayford. His father was a Bangor lumber baron. Peirce had three siblings, an older brother and a younger sister and brother. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and graduated in 1903. He then attended Harvard University and, by his own account, barely graduated due to copious amounts of time spent in the local pool hall and other trivial pursuits. Although Peirce always identified with the Class of 1907, the exact year of his graduation is not clear, and he may have received his diploma in either 1908 or 1909. Peirce was a large man for his time, and he was drafted onto the Harvard football team, solely, he said, because of his size. He played the center position. After Harvard, Peirce studied art at the Art Students League in New York City, and later, traveled to Europe where he studied at both the Académie Julian in Paris and with the Spanish artist Ignacio Zuloaga. He initially focused on Impressionism.

In 1915, two years before the entry of the United States into World War I, he joined the American Field Service, an ambulance corps that served on the French battlefields. He was later decorated with the Croix de Guerre by the French government for bravery at Verdun. For 10 years, between 1910 and 1920, Peirce lived the expatriate life in France and Paris, before returning to the United States for a couple of years. He then returned to Europe for several more years, and only returned to the U.S. permanently with the advent of World War II.
In 1938, he was commissioned by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts to paint two murals, &quot;Legends of the Hudson&quot; and &quot;Rip van Winkle&quot;, for the U.S. Post Office in Troy, New York.

In 1960 Lehigh University exhibited his paintings along with ceramics by Raymond Gallucci and paintings by Charles Ward in an exhibition curated by Francis Quirk.

===John Reed prank===
In 1910, Peirce enjoyed a bit of local notoriety when his prank on friend John Reed, the American communist who is buried in the Kremlin walls, became known and circulated. The duo had booked passage on a cattle freighter from Boston to England, but as the ship was leaving Boston Harbor, Peirce apparently decided that the accommodations were not to his taste. Without a word to anyone, he jumped off the back of the ship and swam several miles back to shore. Reed was then arrested by the ship&#x27;s captain for his alleged involvement in the disappearance of his traveling companion and thrown into the brig. When the freighter eventually arrived in England, Peirce was at the dock waiting to greet his friend Reed. After his swim back to shore, or, by another account, being picked up by a lobster boat, he had then taken a faster ship to England. In later accounts, Peirce&#x27;s John Reed story seemed to evolve and shift, to the extent its veracity may never be truly known. One further embellishment to the story is that Peirce had swum in a multi-mile swimming contest at Harvard a few days prior.

===Friendship with Ernest Hemingway===
Peirce was a longtime friend of Ernest Hemingway. After WWI had come to an end, Peirce befriended Hemingway in Europe and the two traveled together to various continental locations, in particular Spain. In 1937, a painted portrait of Hemingway by Peirce appeared on the cover of the October 18th issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Peirce was once called &quot;the Ernest Hemingway of American painters.&quot; To that he replied, &quot;They&#x27;ll never call Ernest Hemingway the Waldo Peirce of American writers.&quot; His friendship with Hemingway ended only with Hemingway&#x27;s death in 1961.

==Personal life==
Peirce was married four times and had five children.

His first marriage was to Dorothy Rice, an artist, aviator, and the first woman to receive a U.S. motorcycle license. Her father was Isaac Rice, a New York lawyer, professor of law, and the founding publisher of &quot;Forum Magazine&quot;. Dorothy studied sculpture and painting in the Art Students League, with instruction from Robert Henri, William Merritt Chase, John Sloan, and George Bellows. She met Peirce through a mutual friend, George Biddle, and wrote in her 1938 autobiography, &quot;Curiouser and Curiouser&quot;, &quot;I inquired Waldo&#x27;s height—he was six feet two. This seemed a dignified height. I told George to produce Waldo, which he did. We got married in Madrid, in a German Methodist Church, with the American vice-consul, who was a Filipino, to make it legal.&quot; Rice filed for divorce in 1917. She remarried and would go on to become a world-class bridge player with husband Hal Sims. Aside from being an artist, Dorothy Rice was a writer and published the mystery novel &quot;Fog&quot;, with Valentine Williams. She died in 1960 [in Cairo] while still working as an international political news correspondent.

Ivy Troutman (1884–1979) was an actress who appeared &quot;in at least 21 Broadway productions between 1902 and 1945,&quot; according to Wikipedia, many of them long-running hits, one of them, &quot;The Late George Apley&quot;, a satire on Boston high society co-written by George S. Kaufman and John P. Marquand, running through 384 shows. The two were married in 1920 and moved to Paris. According to her former paperboy, Jim Forest, Ivy became close friends with writer James Joyce during her time in Paris. &quot;Perhaps the greatest treasure in her treasure-filled house was a copy of the first edition of Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses...&quot;

Alzira Handforth Boehm was the granddaughter of Vienna-born August Abraham Boehm, the high-flying developer who built an 11-story skyscraper in the Manhattan Diamond District that was one of the first in the world. Known as 14 Maiden Lane or The Diamond Exchange, it still stands. She studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan and later studied in Paris. Dr. William Gallagher of Bangor, an expert on Waldo Peirce, writes in the &quot;Harvard Review&quot; that Alzira met Waldo &quot;at a Matisse show in New York.&quot; In Paris she delivered the couple&#x27;s twin boys, Michael and Mellen. They then had a daughter, Anna. Mellen Chamberlain Peirce is an active poet and playwright who lives in London. His wife is Gareth Peirce, the human rights activist attorney for the Birmingham Six and Gerry Conlon and the Guildford Four. Emma Thompson was nominated for an Oscar playing Gareth in the 1993 movie &quot;In The Name of the Father&quot;, with Daniel Day-Lewis also nominated for his role as Conlon.

In 1938, both Alzira and Waldo joined the Works Progress Administration as a husband-and-wife team. Ellsworth&#x27;s City Hall is graced by an Alzira mural, Ellsworth, Lumber Port. During World War II, Alzira was an Army captain in the American Red Cross Motor Corps. When the war was over, she and Waldo divorced. She then moved to New Mexico and worked as an organizer for the United Mine Workers.

Alzira&#x27;s talent, drive, and the children she had with Waldo deeply influenced his art. When Waldo was painting Hemingway in Key West, or sailors dancing at Sloppy Joe&#x27;s, Alzira was painting, too, literally and figuratively, at his side. She was painting across generations.

Ellen Antoinette Larsen was Waldo&#x27;s fourth wife, and they remained married for 24 years until his death. &quot;I spoke with my Aunt Karin,&quot; Will Peirce, Waldo&#x27;s grandson, writes. &quot;Her mother was Ellen Larsen, born in Minneapolis in 1920, passed away in 2001. She studied art in New York—she painted. A friend of Ellen&#x27;s used to model for Waldo, and she and Waldo went to a well-known cafe or restaurant where Ellen waited tables. It was during wartime. The romance started there. She preferred the quiet life in Maine, but she kept a pied-à-terre in Manhattan. After they got married, she modeled for Waldo, as did his kids. There was no escaping that job in our family! Her painting style resembled Waldo&#x27;s sometimes. Sometimes it was quite different.&quot;

Peirce was devoted to his children and painted them many hundreds of times. In a letter written in the mid-1930s, Ernest Hemingway described a visit by Peirce to his home in Key West, Florida: &quot;Waldo is here with his kids like untrained hyenas and him as domesticated as a cow. Lives only for the children and with the time he puts on them they should have good manners and be well trained but instead they never obey, destroy everything, don&#x27;t even answer when spoken to, and he is like an old hen with a litter of ape hyenas. I doubt if he will go out in the boat while he is here. Can&#x27;t leave the children. They have a nurse and a housekeeper too, but he is only really happy when trying to paint with one setting fire to his beard and the other rubbing mashed potato into his canvasses. That represents fatherhood.&quot;

Peirce&#x27;s older brother, Hayford, was a noted authority on Byzantine art and his third wife, Alzira Peirce (1908–2010), also enjoyed a modest reputation as a painter. His nephew, Hayford Peirce (1942–2020), was a science-fiction and mystery writer. Prominent British solicitor Gareth Peirce married his son Bill.

==Death and legacy==
A resident of Searsport, Maine, Peirce died on March 8, 1970, in Newburyport, Massachusetts, of a cerebral thrombosis. He was 85 years old. He was survived by his fourth wife, Ellen Antoinette Larsen, and his three sons and two daughters. He is interred in Mount Hope Cemetery, Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine.

Peirce&#x27;s paintings have been acquired and exhibited by several prominent museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and the Brooklyn Museum, among others.

<text>Wattle Glen is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 25 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Wattle Glen recorded a population of 1,911 at the .

The nearest public libraries are Diamond Valley Library and Eltham Library and the mobile library which stops at Hurstbridge operated by Yarra Plenty Regional Library.

==History==

The Post Office opened on 1 November 1901 as Diamond Creek Upper, was renamed Wattle Glen on 1 November 1922, and closed on 4 April 1975. When the railway line arrived in 1912 the railway station was named Balee on 25 June. This was renamed &quot;Wattleglen&quot; (as one word) on 14 August 1922. &quot;Balee&quot; was changed to &quot;Wattleglen&quot; (one word) on 14 August 1922 as advised by Victorian Railways Weekly Notice No. 32 of 1922, although it is now more commonly known and signed as &quot;Wattle Glen&quot; (two words).

Its popular meet and greet spot is the local general store, which was built and opened in 1988. The original general store was burnt down in the early 1900s and was located across the road from this one. Locals also gather at the Wattle Glen Cricket Club.

Wattle Glen is a small town wedged between suburbia, Diamond Creek, and the rural fringes of Hurstbridge. There are few facilities except the Railway Station, General Store, Tennis Club, CFA station, and a scout hall. Wattle Glen has a small primary school known as Wattle Glen Primary School.

<text>Ballyporeen () is a village in County Tipperary, Ireland. The 2016 census recorded a village population of 318.

==Location==
It lies in the Galtee-Vee Valley with the Galtee Mountains to the north and the Knockmealdowns to the south. The River Duag which is a tributary of the Suir runs through the village. It is located on the R665 regional road. The nearest large towns are Mitchelstown and Cahir, which are 12 km and 21 km respectively.

The village is approximately 11 km from Junction 12 of the M8 Motorway.

==Transport==
During the week, it is served five times a day in each direction by Bus Éireann route 245 linking it to Clonmel, Mitchelstown, Fermoy and Cork. During the weekend, there are three buses each way.

==Name==
The origins of the name are not definitively understood. The most accepted Irish translation is the &quot;Ford Mouth of the Round Stones&quot;. Those stones may have been river deposits or dye stones left there by inhabitants from a cloth dyeing process.
Another theory is the original name got corrupted and ambiguated over time; a 1618 document referred to &quot;Bealanporan&quot;, this and possible previous forms would alter its meaning. One respected historian believed &#x27;Powers-town&#x27; was the correct translation of its origins. An Anglo-Norman family called Power did have connections with the area.

==History==
The birth period of Ballyporeen as a nucleated settlement is unknown. Up until the 18th century, Carrigvisteal (approx 1.5 km north of the village) was the main settlement node in the area.
Ballyporeen&#x27;s subsequent growth may put down to a number of factors. In the 1700s the village was on the main coach road between Cork and Dublin, this would have led to passing trade and the opportunity for providing boarding houses and inns for travellers. There was also a mill at lower Main Street, this was known as Kingston&#x27;s Mills and would have provided employment opportunities. It was operational until at least 1811.

The biggest single factor for the development and expansion of the village, was the involvement of the Earls of Kingston, the main landlord in the area. They owned the market rights on the estate and by 1810 (at the latest), large open air markets were held in the village three times a year. The fact the mill also bore their name indicates they were also probably influential in its creation.

Robert the 2nd Earl is most likely responsible for the village&#x27;s planned street design, he initiated an ambitious building programme across the estate in the late 1700s. 
Ground rents were kept low in the village to attract shopkeepers and tradespeople. The first edition Ordnance Survey maps (circa 1840) show the basic layout of the village as it is today encompassing the wide straight main street.

Lewis&#x27; survey of 1837 notes the village as being located in the barony of Iffa and Offa West and reported that there were 113 houses and 513 inhabitants.

==People==
Ballyporeen is best known for being the ancestral home of United States President Ronald Reagan. His great-grandfather, Michael Regan (who later changed the spelling of his name), was baptised in the village in 1829 and lived there until his emigration to London not later than 1851 and ultimately the United States in 1857. President Reagan visited the village on 3 June 1984 and delivered a speech to its residents, during which he discussed his ancestry and what he called the &quot;Irish-American tradition&quot;.

There was some opposition to Reagan&#x27;s visit to Ireland, particularly from the Roman Catholic Church. Authorities kept approximately 600 protesters behind barriers on the outskirts of the village on that day, they were not permitted inside until the presidential party had departed. The main focus of the protesters was toward the Reagan administration&#x27;s foreign policy, in particular its support of the Contras in Nicaragua.

Ballyporeen was previously home to The Ronald Reagan Pub. While the building still stands, the pub closed in 2004 and the following year its fittings and external signage were transferred to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

Ballyporeen is home to the singer/songwriter Gemma Hayes whose hits include Hanging Around from her debut album Night on my Side which was released to critical acclaim and was nominated for the 2002 Mercury Music Prize.

==Sport==
Soccer, Gaelic football, hurling, racquetball and handball are all represented by clubs in the area.

The local Gaelic football club, Ballyporeen GAA, competes at Senior level within the Southern division of Tipperary GAA. The rural settlement of Skeheenarinky has a hurling club, Skeheenarinky GAA, currently competing at Intermediate level. Ballyporeen has also had a very successful record in handball.

==Parish==
The Catholic and Anglican parishes were historically known as Templetenny.

The Catholic Church and clergy based in Ballyporeen service both communities of Ballyporeen and Skeheenarinky which are in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore.
The church is called &#x27;The Church of the Assumption&#x27; and was opened in 1828.

The local Church of Ireland parish has been amalgamated into the wider Clonmel Union of Parishes. St Matthews; a 50-seater church which stood at the top of Main Street was dismantled c.1911.

There is a ruin of an ancient church at Templetenny approximately 4 km east of the present village of Ballyporeen. The site itself has Christian monastic origins and dates to at least 750 AD when St. Finnchadh was recorded as being abbot.

==Cultural references==
Ballyporeen is mentioned in the Counting Crows song &quot;Washington Square&quot; off their album &quot;Saturday Nights &amp; Sunday Mornings&quot; and Christy Moore&#x27;s song &quot;Hey! Ronnie Reagan&quot; about Reagan&#x27;s 1984 visit to Ireland.

<text>Yarrambat is a town in Victoria, Australia, 24 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. Yarrambat recorded a population of 1,602 at the .

Yarrambat is located within Greater Melbourne, beyond the Melbourne metropolitan area Urban Growth Boundary.

==History==
Prominent as a gold mining area in the late 19th century, much of the land was surveyed and cleared for farming once the mining boom subsided. The area was rich with local orchards including well known local farming family the Stuchbery&#x27;s. Church services began in the area in 1884 with many denomination using the local schoolhouse. After purchasing land and working with local builders the St Michaels Anglican Church was officially opened on 21 February 1954. 

The Post Office opened on 1 March 1910 as Tanck&#x27;s Corner and was renamed Yarrambat around 1928.

It is unknown why the name was changed however Yarrambat is named from a Woiwurrung word meaning &quot;high hills&quot; or &quot;pleasant views&quot;. The initial choice of residents was to rename the area Kanangra however it was decided it was too close to the Queensland township name of Kanungra.

==Today==
Recently land has been allowed to be subdivided into 1 hectare allotments by the Shire of Nillumbik, with large prestige homes dotting the landscape. Yarrambat has become one of Melbourne&#x27;s affluent north eastern suburbs due to many of its properties being constructed on large allotments within relatively close proximity to the City.

==Facilities==

It contains a post office, veterinarian clinic, child minding centre, recreation reserve, war memorial, a primary school (Yarrambat Primary School), kindergarten, a private school, a general store, memorial hall and a CFA fire station, as well as a railway museum. The Yarrambat Historical Society Inc was formed in 1990 to preserve the heritage of the area. Its major project being the relocation of original 1878 Primary School to become the Yarrambat Heritage Museum.

In 1978, Yarrambat celebrated its centenary, including a festival at the primary school, which at that time was adjacent to the main T-intersection (which has been referred to as Tanck&#x27;s Corner). The school was relocated to new buildings in the 1980s. Further upgrades (in excess of $3 million (AUD)) to the school have occurred during 2007, the most prominent feature being 5 open plan classrooms, office redevelopment and a gymnasium (3/4 size basketball court). The school has spent significant time and effort into developing Inquiry Based Learning.

A mobile library operated by Yarra Plenty Regional Library regularly stops in the township.

==Sport==

Golfers play at the Yarrambat Park Golf Course on Yan Yean Road.

War Memorial park is the home to Yarrambat Junior Football Club, Plenty Valley Cricket Club, and Yarrambat Netball Club.

Yarrambat Park is also home to the Diamond Valley Archery Club, which includes an outdoor target range, an 18 metre indoor range and a field course. The Northern Suburbs Fly Fishing Club is based at Yarrambat Park Lake sharing its clubhouse with the archery club. Yarrambat Horse and Pony Club have regular rallies and clinics.

Greensborough Model Aircraft Club is located at the heart of the park. GMAC was formed in 1966. Today, nearing 60 years later, GMAC still runs strong, with 100s of pilots performing 10,000+ flights a year. GMAC offers members some of the best model flying facilities in Australia including covered and powered pitts area.

The Yarrambat-Plenty Little Athletics Club competes as part of the Diamond Valley Little Athletics Centre.

<doc id="737654" wikidata="Q2885187" url="?curid=737654" title="Keenleyside Dam">
<text>Hugh Keenleyside Dam (formerly known as the High Arrow Dam) is a flood control dam spanning the Columbia River, 12 km (6.5 miles) upstream of the city of Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada.

==Dam==
The dam is at the outflow of what was the upper and lower Arrow Lakes; today the two lakes are joined forming one long reservoir extending north to Revelstoke Dam, and contains 8.76 km3 (7.1 MAF) of reservoir volume. The dam is operated by BC Hydro.

The long earth fill and concrete dam was built as part of fulfilling Canada&#x27;s obligations under the Columbia River Treaty, along with the Duncan Dam, both were built to prevent flooding and control the flow of water in the Columbia River for downstream hydroelectric dams. It was commissioned on October 10, 1968, six months ahead of schedule.

Immediately downstream of the dam a 185 megawatt (MW) hydroelectric powerhouse, the Arrow Lakes Generating Station, began construction in 1999 and was completed in 2002. The station is owned by the Columbia Power Corporation.

Lower Arrow Lake was raised 12 metres (40 feet) above the natural levels, resulting in several towns being dismantled and relocated before their sites were flooded, including Burton.

The dam was named after Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside, the Canadian ambassador to Mexico, 1944–1947. Hugh Keenleyside served as the chairman of the British Columbia Power Commission and co-chairman at the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority from 1962 to 1969.

The Arrow Lakes reservoir is described by BC Hydro as a &quot;great waterway for boating&quot;, despite the effect that the difference between high and low water has on docks and ramps. The dam is equipped with a navigation lock - the only such lock west of Manitoba - which is available at no charge to boaters. However, commercial traffic and floating logs have priority over leisure craft.

<doc id="737656" wikidata="Q158576" url="?curid=737656" title="Oxalis acetosella">
<text>Oxalis acetosella, the wood sorrel or common wood sorrel, is a rhizomatous flowering plant in the family &quot;Oxalidaceae&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;acetosella&quot; refers to its sour taste. The common name wood sorrel is often used for other plants in the genus &quot;Oxalis&quot;.

In much of its range, most of Europe and parts of Asia, it is the only member of its genus and hence simply known as the wood sorrel. While &#x27;common wood sorrel&#x27; may be used to differentiate it from most other species, this name is also used for North America&#x27;s &quot;Oxalis montana&quot;.

==Description==

The plant grows up to tall. It has trifoliate compound leaves, the leaflets heart-shaped and folded through the middle, that occur in groups of three on the long petioles. Appearing atop the thin stems from spring to midsummer are small open-faced flowers with five petals which are white with reddish venation. The flowers rarely appear reddish or mauve. During the night or when it rains, the flowers close and the leaves fold.

=== Similar species ===
&quot;Anemonoides nemorosa&quot; (wood anemone) is similar. Both have white flowers, are small, and are found in woody shady places. &quot;Anemonoides nemorosa&quot; however has palmately lobed leaves and does not have true petals but large sepals which are petal-like.

== Distribution and habitat ==
It grows in woods and shady places in the Northern Hemisphere. It is commonly found in Great Britain and Ireland.

==Uses==
As with other species of wood sorrel, the leaves are sometimes eaten by humans, but are high in oxalic acid. An oxalate called &quot;sal acetosella&quot; was formerly extracted from the plant by boiling it.

==In culture==
The common wood sorrel is sometimes referred to as a shamrock and given as a gift on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. This is due to its trifoliate clover-like leaf, and to early references to shamrock being eaten. Despite this, it is generally accepted that the plant described as &quot;true&quot; shamrock is a species of clover, usually lesser clover (&quot;Trifolium dubium&quot;).

Common wood sorrel is also known as &quot;Alleluia&quot; because it blossoms between Easter and Pentecost, when the Psalms which end with Hallelujah are sung.

<text>Jean Despres (1903 – August 19, 1878) was a perfume industry businessman, known for his work with Coty

The French-born Jean Despres came to New York in 1921 working for Coty. Starting as a shipping clerk, he went on to become a travelling salesman, covering thousands of miles on the Santa Fe Railroad across America to sell Coty perfumes and gift sets. He soon became a sales manager, and in 1942 was appointed Executive Vice President of Coty. He had held this position for more than 25 years when Pfizer purchased Coty in 1968.

Coty, was a French perfume company created by wealthy François Coty, proprietor of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, the French daily newspaper headquartered on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, France and owner of numerous chateaux and villas in France and Corsica. Coty died in 1934. Jean Despres led Coty in New York with Philippe Cortney, brother-in-law of Mrs.Coty-Cotnareanu. He founded the Fragrance Foundation in New York, for the perfume industry, serving as its president. When he retired he appointed Anette Greene. He was a founder of the Toilet Goods Association Inc., Washington, D.C., and served as its president in the 1960s, attending its annual meetings until 1987, a year before his death.

With the expansion of department stores in the 1930s and 1940s, he created &quot;in-store&quot; displays and &quot;in-store&quot; merchandising staff, which evolved into the cosmetics counters of today.

He was a founding member of the Coty American Fashion Critics&#x27; Awards, along with Grover Whalen, created to encourage and honor American talent and American fashion designers. The awards presentation ceremony initially took place at the Metropolitan Club (where he was a member for 50 years) subsequently moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and eventually held at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center. He joined the New York Athletic Club when it opened in 1924, was a director of the French Hospital in New York City, of Coty International, the French-American Chamber of Commerce, Compagnie de St. Gobain and Lilly Dache, Inc., a Chevalier of the Confrerie des Chevaliers de Tastevin, and resident of New York City, Pound Ridge, NY, Delray Beach, Florida and Meudon, France. In the 1940s he became an American Citizen.

Despres married milliner and fashion designer Lilly Daché in Palm Beach, Florida on March 13, 1786. His grandson, John Gordon Gauld, is a New York and Massachusetts artist. Daughter, Suzanne Dache, continues the Dache businesses.

<text>David Oliver Tonkin (20 July 1929 – 2 October 2000) was an Australian politician who served as the 38th Premier of South Australia from 18 September 1979 to 10 November 1982. He was elected to the House of Assembly seat of Bragg at the 1970 election, serving until 1983. He became the leader of the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia in 1975, replacing Bruce Eastick. Initially leading the party to defeat at the 1977 election against the Don Dunstan Labor government, his party won the 1979 election against the Des Corcoran Labor government. Following the 1980 Norwood by-election the Tonkin government was reduced to a one-seat majority. His government&#x27;s policy approach combined economic conservatism with social progressivism. The Tonkin Liberal government was defeated after one term at the 1982 election by Labor led by John Bannon.

==Early life==
David Tonkin was born in Unley, South Australia, on 20 July 1929. When he was five, his father, Oliver, died, leaving Tonkin&#x27;s mother, Bertha, to raise him. Tonkin attended local public schools before gaining a scholarship to St Peter&#x27;s College. Accepted into Medicine at the University of Adelaide, Tonkin worked as a taxi driver while completing his degree and practised as a General Practitioner before undertaking a postgraduate ophthalmology course in London. He established a practice in Adelaide and was soon considered one of the city&#x27;s leading eye surgeons. Tonkin was of Cornish ancestry.

Tonkin&#x27;s dedication to aiding the wider community was manifest through his honorary service as an eye surgeon to Adelaide public hospitals and through the initiation, through the Lions Club, of Australia&#x27;s first public screening programme for glaucoma. In 1962 Tonkin became executive director of the Australian Foundation for Prevention of Blindness SA Inc.

==Career==

From a young age, Tonkin was a supporter of the Liberal and Country League (LCL), handing out how-to-vote cards at the 1939 election for the party. His prominence in Adelaide society and his community service made him an ideal LCL candidate. In 1968, he unsuccessfully challenged Premier Don Dunstan in Dunstan&#x27;s seat of Norwood before becoming the first member for the adjacent seat of Bragg at the 1970 election.

Tonkin quickly gained a reputation as a progressive member of the LCL. He was an early supporter of the Liberal Movement faction created by former premier Steele Hall, although Tonkin remained with the LCL when the Liberal Movement split from it.

Tonkin gained statewide prominence in 1974, when he successfully introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to outlaw sex discrimination, the first such law in Australia. A year later, this prominence led him to challenge Bruce Eastick for the leadership of what by then had become the South Australia branch of the Liberal Party. Tonkin became leader after Eastick stood aside.

As leader, Tonkin worked toward healing the internal party wounds by coaxing the Liberal Movement back into the Liberal fold. Although the Liberals lost the 1977 election (Dunstan&#x27;s government remained fairly popular with voters, and memories of the LCL split were still vivid), they easily won the 1979 election against Labor, briefly led by Des Corcoran. At that election, the Liberals won 55 percent of the two-party vote on a swing of over eight percent. At the time, this was the largest two-party victory for any party since the end of the Playmander, exceeding Labor taking 54.5 percent in 1973. While this would have normally been enough for a strong majority government in the rest of Australia, the Liberals won only 13 seats in Adelaide. As a result, they only won 25 of 47 seats, just two more than needed to govern alone. Even so, it was the first time that the main non-Labor party in South Australia had won a majority of the two-party vote while also winning the most seats since its predecessor, the LCL, won 50.3 percent of the two-party vote in 1959.

Already governing on a knife-edge, Tonkin&#x27;s majority became even slimmer in 1980 after a court decision threw out a Liberal victory in Dunstan&#x27;s old seat Norwood, and Labor regained it in the ensuing by-election. As a result, Tonkin found himself with a bare majority of one seat.

===Premier===
Also serving as his own state Treasurer, Tonkin combined fiscal conservatism with implementing socially progressive reforms. In the former, Tonkin made significant cuts to the public service, earning him the enmity of the unions, while an example of the latter was the passage of the land rights bill and the return to the Pitjantjatjara people of 10 per cent of South Australia&#x27;s area.

Other significant actions include the development of the copper and uranium mine at Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs), extending his earlier anti-discrimination provisions to include physical disability, establishing the Ethnic Affairs Commission and introducing random breath testing (RBT).

Bidding for re-election at the 1982 election, Tonkin had support of the South Australian media. However, the economy was hit by the early 1980s recession. The government suffered a large swing at the 1982 Florey state by-election before narrowly losing the state election two months later to Labor led by John Bannon. Tonkin resigned from parliament shortly after following a heart complaint. Graham Ingerson easily retained the seat for the Liberals at the ensuing by-election.

Until the defeat of Steven Marshall in 2022, Tonkin was the only non-Labor Premier to have served for at least a full term since the main non-Labor party in South Australia adopted the Liberal banner.

==After politics==
Subsequently, Tonkin returned to ophthalmology and served in various capacities in different government and community organisations, including chairman of the board of the State Opera from 1985 to 1986 and vice-president of Sturt Football Club. In 1986, he assumed the London-based position of Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.

Returning to Australia in 1992, Tonkin was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1993 and served as chairman of the South Australian Film Corporation from 1994 to 1996. A stroke in 1996 permanently affected his speech and forced him into retirement.
Tonkin was awarded the Liberal Party&#x27;s outstanding achievement award in 2000 by Prime Minister John Howard and died in his sleep at Mengler Hill, Barossa Valley, South Australia, on 2 October 2000 while attending a music festival. He was survived by his wife Prue, six children and 10 grandchildren.

Following his death, the Pitjantjatjara people paid tribute to Tonkin, stating that no Liberal politician had done as much for Aboriginal people. Others stated that he lost the 1982 election because he lacked the ruthlessness required of successful politicians.

The Board Room in the Bragg Electorate Office is named in his honour. In addition, a Memorial Dinner in his name is also now held each year by The South Australian Young Liberal Movement.

<text>The prytaneis (πρυτάνεις; sing.: πρύτανις &quot;prytanis&quot;) were the executives of the &quot;boule&quot; of ancient Athens.

==Origins and organization==
The term (like &quot;basileus&quot; or &quot;tyrannos&quot;) is probably of Pre-Greek etymology (possibly cognate to Etruscan &quot;(e)prθni&quot;).

When Cleisthenes reorganized the Athenian government in 508/7 BCE, he replaced the old Solonian boule, or council, of 400 with a new boule of 500. The old boule consisted of 100 members of each of the four ancestral tribes. Cleisthenes created ten new tribes and made the boule consist of 50 men from each of these tribes. Each tribe&#x27;s delegation would be an executive of the boule for one-tenth of the year, so that ten groups of prytaneis served each year, a position granted by sortition. The executive officers were known as prytaneis and their term of office as a prytany (πρυτανία).

==Duties==
The &quot;prytaneis&quot; served every day during their prytany. They formally called to meeting the full boule and the ecclesia of Athens, though in practice many meetings were mandatory and evidence suggests that persuasive individuals could enjoin the prytaneis to call or not to call a supplementary meeting. The prytaneis received ambassadors from foreign states and generally conducted the day-to-day business of the state. They ate at public expense in the &quot;tholos&quot;, a circular edifice constructed for them next to the boule house.

Each day, for one 24-hour period, one member of the 50 prytaneis was selected by lot to serve as the foreman (ἐπιστάτης &quot;epistates&quot;, &quot;caretaker&quot;). He administered the state seal and the keys to the state treasuries and archives. He was, in effect, the chief executive officer of Athens. No man was allowed to hold this office more than once, and so probably more than half of all adult male Athenians held it, at one time or another.

During meetings of the &quot;ecclesia&quot; or &quot;boule&quot;, the current foreman also chaired these meetings. In the Fourth Century, this practice changed and the chairmanship of meetings was taken over by an office specifically created for this task (the πρόεδροι &quot;proedroi&quot;).

==In other cities==
&quot;Prytanis&quot; as a title is used in other ancient Greek cities including Rhodes, Alexandria and other cities along the west coast of Asia Minor. Offices that use this title usually have responsibility for presiding over councils of some kind. In the city of Miletus, the &quot;prytanis&quot; had enough power that he was able to become a &quot;tyrannos&quot; (Aristotle Politics V.5, 1305a17).

<doc id="737686" wikidata="Q348408" url="?curid=737686" title="Martianus Capella">
<text>Martianus Minneus Felix Capella () was a jurist, polymath and Latin prose writer of late antiquity, one of the earliest developers of the system of the seven liberal arts that structured early medieval education. He was a native of Madaura.

His single encyclopedic work, &quot;De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii&quot; (&quot;On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury&quot;), also called &quot;De septem disciplinis&quot; (&quot;On the seven disciplines&quot;), is an elaborate didactic allegory written in a mixture of prose and elaborately allusive verse.

Martianus often presents philosophical views based on Neoplatonism, the Platonic school of philosophy pioneered by Plotinus and his followers.

Like his near-contemporary Macrobius, who also produced a major work on classical Roman religion, Martianus never directly identifies his own religious affiliation. Much of his work occurs in the form of dialogue, and the views of the interlocutors may not represent the author&#x27;s own.

==Life==
According to Cassiodorus, Martianus was a native of Madaura—which had been the native city of Apuleius—in the Roman province of Africa (now Souk Ahras, Algeria). He appears to have practiced as a jurist at Roman Carthage.

Martianus was active during the 5th century, writing after the sack of Rome by Alaric I in 410, which he mentions, but apparently before the conquest of North Africa by the Vandals in 429.

As early as the middle of the 6th century, Securus Memor Felix, a professor of rhetoric, received the text in Rome, for his personal subscription at the end of Book I (or Book II in many manuscripts) records that he was working &quot;from most corrupt exemplars&quot;. Gerardus Vossius erroneously took this to mean that Martianus was himself active in the 6th century, giving rise to a long-standing misconception about Martianus&#x27;s dating.

The lunar crater Capella is named after him.

== &quot;De nuptiis&quot; ==
This single encyclopedic work, De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii (&quot;On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury&quot;), sometimes called &quot;De septem disciplinis&quot; (&quot;On the seven disciplines&quot;) or the &quot;Satyricon&quot;, is an elaborate didactic allegory written in a mixture of prose and elaborately allusive verse, a &quot;prosimetrum&quot; in the manner of the Menippean satires of Varro. The style is wordy and involved, loaded with metaphor and bizarre expressions. The book was of great importance in defining the standard formula of academic learning from the Christianized Roman Empire of the fifth century until the Renaissance of the 12th century. This formula included a medieval love for allegory (in particular personifications) as a means of presenting knowledge, and a structuring of that learning around the seven liberal arts.

The book, embracing in résumé form the narrowed classical culture of his time, was dedicated to his son. Its frame story in the first two books relates the courtship and wedding of Mercury (intelligent or profitable pursuit), who has been refused by Wisdom, Divination and the Soul, with the maiden Philologia (learning, or more literally the love of letters and study), who is made immortal under the protection of the gods, the Muses, the Cardinal Virtues and the Graces. The title refers to the allegorical union of the intellectually profitable pursuit (Mercury) of learning by way of the art of letters (Philology).

Among the wedding gifts are seven maids who will be Philology&#x27;s servants. They are the seven liberal arts: Grammar (an old woman with a knife for excising children&#x27;s grammatical errors), Dialectic, Rhetoric (a tall woman with a dress decorated with figures of speech and armed in a fashion to harm adversaries), Geometry, Arithmetic, Astronomy and (musical) Harmony. As each art is introduced, she gives an exposition of the principles of the science she represents, thereby providing a summary of the seven liberal arts. Two other arts, Architecture and Medicine, were present at the feast, but since they care for earthly things, they were to keep silent in the company of the celestial deities.

Each book is an abstract or a compilation from earlier authors. The treatment of the subjects belongs to a tradition which goes back to Varro&#x27;s &quot;Disciplinae&quot;, even to Varro&#x27;s passing allusion to architecture and medicine, which in Martianus Capella&#x27;s day were mechanics&#x27; arts, material for clever slaves but not for senators. The classical Roman curriculum, which was to pass—largely through Martianus Capella&#x27;s book—into the early medieval period, was modified but scarcely revolutionized by Christianity. The verse portions, on the whole correct and classically constructed, are in imitation of Varro.
The eighth book describes a modified geocentric astronomical model, in which the Earth is at rest in the center of the universe and circled by the Moon, the Sun, three planets and the stars, while Mercury and Venus circle the Sun. The view that Mercury and Venus circle the Sun was singled out as one not to &quot;disregard&quot; by Copernicus in Book I of his &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;.

===Influence===
Martianus Capella can best be understood in connection with the reputation of his book. The work was read, taught, and commented upon throughout the early Middle Ages and shaped European education during the early medieval period and the Carolingian Renaissance.

As early as the end of the fifth century, another African, Fulgentius, composed a work modeled on it. A note found in numerous manuscripts—written by one Securus Memor Felix, who was intending to produce an edition—indicates that by about 534 the dense and convoluted text of &quot;De nuptiis&quot; had already become hopelessly corrupted by scribal errors (Michael Winterbottom suggests that Securus Memor&#x27;s work may be the basis of the text found in &quot;an impressive number of extant books&quot; written in the ninth century). Another sixth-century writer, Gregory of Tours, attests that it had become virtually a school manual. In his 1959 study, C. Leonardi catalogued 241 existing manuscripts of &quot;De nuptiis&quot;, attesting to its popularity during the Middle Ages. It was commented upon copiously: by John Scotus Erigena, Hadoard, Alexander Neckham, and Remigius of Auxerre. In the eleventh century the German monk Notker Labeo translated the first two books into Old High German. Martianus continued to play a major role as transmitter of ancient learning until the rise of a new system of learning founded on scholastic Aristotelianism. As late as the thirteenth century, Martianus was still credited as having been the efficient cause of the study of astronomy.

Modern interpreters have less interest in Martianus&#x27;s ideas, &quot;except for the light his work throws on what men in other times and places knew or thought it was important to know about the &quot;artes liberales&quot;&quot;. C. S. Lewis, in &quot;The Allegory of Love&quot;, states that &quot;the universe, which has produced the bee-orchid and the giraffe, has produced nothing stranger than Martianus Capella&quot;.

The editio princeps of &quot;De nuptiis&quot;, edited by Franciscus Vitalis Bodianus, was printed in Vicenza in 1499. The work&#x27;s comparatively late date in print, as well as the modest number of later editions, is a marker of the slide in its popularity, save as an elementary educational primer in the liberal arts. For many years the standard edition of the work was that of A. Dick (Teubner, 1925), but J. Willis produced a new edition for Teubner in 1983.

A modern introduction, focusing on the mathematical arts, is &quot;Martianus Capella and the Seven Liberal Arts&quot;, vol. 1: &quot;The Quadrivium of Martianus Capella: Latin Traditions in the Mathematical Sciences, 50 B.C. – A.D. 1250&quot;. Volume 2 of this work is an English translation of &quot;De nuptiis&quot;.

<text>Nguyễn Thị Thiên Thanh (born October 24, 1981), better known by her stage name Tila Tequila, is an American model, singer, television and social media personality. She has also used the names Tila Nguyen, Miss Tila and Tornado Thien. Born in Singapore and raised in Houston, Texas, Tequila moved to Los Angeles in 2001 to pursue her modeling career. She first gained recognition for her active presence on social networking websites. After being featured as a model in numerous men&#x27;s magazines (including &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot; and &quot;Maxim&quot;), she made her reality television debut on the VH1 show &quot;Surviving Nugent&quot; (2003). After becoming the most popular person on Myspace, Tequila was offered the opportunity to star in her own reality television series. Her bisexuality-themed dating show, &quot;A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila&quot; (2007), aired for two seasons and became MTV&#x27;s second-highest-rated series premiere of that year.

In addition to her career in modeling and television, Tequila also pursued her career as a recording artist. She was the lead singer of the bands Beyond Betty Jean and Jealousy, before launching a solo career. Her debut single &quot;I Love U&quot; was released in 2007 to mixed reviews. Despite having strong online sales, the song failed to enter any charts. Tequila followed with several independently released singles, including &quot;Stripper Friends&quot; and &quot;Paralyze&quot;. In 2010, she released her second EP, &quot;Welcome to the Dark Side&quot;. Her book, &quot;Hooking Up With Tila Tequila: A Guide to Love, Fame, Happiness, Success, and Being the Life of the Party&quot;, was published in 2008.

She has long used social media and personal blogs to post her comments and has made posts that are described as antisemitic and homophobic. In a 2013 blog post, she expressed her support and admiration of Adolf Hitler. When these comments came to light in 2015, they led to her removal from &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;; she blamed depression and drug use for the comments. She has also made associations with Neo-Nazism and the alt-right.

==Early life==
Nguyen was born in Singapore, where her family were Vietnamese boat people, who arrived from Vietnam after the Vietnam War. Nguyen has an older brother, Daniel, and an older sister, Terri. When she was one year old, the family relocated to a neighborhood in Houston, Texas and was eventually admitted to a gated community run by a strict Buddhist temple. The family left the community when Nguyen was eight. She says she became rebellious and used the drug ecstasy at 11, and says &quot;I used to rob houses, steal cars and stuff. And it just got worse in high school.” This led to her being sent to a reform school for six months.

Nguyen was nicknamed &quot;Tila Tequila&quot; by friends due to her apparent allergy to alcohol. In her memoir, she would later explain that she felt &quot;confused&quot; and &quot;lost&quot; by various personal family and environmental issues. She turned to writing poetry in an attempt to release powerful emotions. At age 16, Nguyen ran away to Queens, New York City, for several months. While still 16, she experienced a drive-by shooting in Houston. She reports having become pregnant and suffering a miscarriage the following year.

Nguyen graduated from Alief Hastings High School in 2000. She has cited her violent adolescence in Texas as her reason for becoming a model and moving to California in 2001. In a March 2003 interview, she revealed that she has taken some college classes but does not have a degree, stating, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to college for an actual degree because there&#x27;s nothing out there I like besides doing something that involves the entertainment industry.&quot;

==Career==
===2001–2005: Modeling career, Beyond Betty Jean and Myspace===

Nguyen&#x27;s modelling career began when she posed for a friend&#x27;s calendar. Then, at the age of 19, she was discovered at the Sharpstown Mall by a &quot;Playboy&quot; scout and was offered a chance to model nude for the magazine. She did a test shoot, then eventually moved to Southern California and was featured as &quot;Playboy&quot;″s Cybergirl of the Week on April 22, 2002, and soon thereafter she became the first Asian Cyber Girl of the Month. A few more pictorials for the magazine followed.

At age 20, Nguyen acted on her interest in rock music and started looking for bands willing to let her join. She eventually assembled a band called Beyond Betty Jean, for which she was singer and songwriter. Beyond Betty Jean eventually broke up and Nguyen started working in recording studios to sharpen her vocal skills and wrote music. Later, she became the lead singer of a band called Jealousy, which released a few songs online before breaking up. In 2003, Nguyen was a contestant on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Surviving Nugent&quot;, a reality TV show where participants performed compromising tasks and stunts for rock star Ted Nugent.

Nguyen gained further popularity through the import racing scene. She has been featured on the cover of &quot;Import Tuner&quot; magazine, at car shows such as Hot Import Nights, and in the video game &quot;Street Racing Syndicate&quot;. Nguyen joined Myspace in the fall of 2003 after getting booted off of Friendster multiple times. She says that &quot;At that time no one was on there at all. I felt like a loser while all the cool kids were at some other school. So I mass e-mailed between 30,000 and 50,000 people and told them to come over. Everybody joined overnight.&quot; She eventually amassed 1.5 million followers on the site and turned it into a business venture selling merchandise. At her maximum, she had 1,771,920 MySpace friends.

===2006–2009: Solo career, and &quot;A Shot at Love&quot;===
During the first season of Fuse TV&#x27;s dance show, &quot;Pants-Off Dance-Off&quot;, on which a group of contestants strip to music videos, Nguyen was the most frequent host. In April 2006, during the taping of an interview with MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; VJs, will.i.am announced that Nguyen had been signed to the Will.I.Am music group, a record label under A&amp;M Records. Despite this major-label signing, Nguyen independently released her first single &quot;I Love U&quot; through iTunes on February 27, 2007, justifying the independent release through her desire to become famous by herself. She also shot a music video for the song. In March 2007, Washington-based record label The Saturday Team released an EP called &quot;Sex&quot;, by Tila Tequila. On July 27, 2007, Italian website MusicBlob reported that The Saturday Team and distributor Icon Music Entertainment Services sued Nguyen over breaching her contract related to the album. However, Nguyen claimed in a MySpace bulletin that the EP was not authorized for release by her, and was removed from most retailers. The Saturday Team won a legal case, making &quot;Sex&quot; available for digital purchase. Nguyen made an appearance as one of the 12 strangers in the first game on April 6, 2007, episode of NBC&#x27;s game show &quot;Identity&quot;. On March 4, 2007, she made a cameo appearance on the show &quot;The War At Home&quot;. She also appeared as a Hooters Girl in the 2007 film &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot;.
In May 2007, Nguyen began filming for a reality show which first aired on MTV on October 9, 2007, as &quot;A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila&quot;. The program was a bisexual-themed dating show where 16 straight men and 16 lesbian women competed for Nguyen&#x27;s affections, the twist being that the contestants were not aware of her bisexuality until the end of the first episode. The ten-episode series was produced by SallyAnn Salsano and MTV. The show led to a heated online debate between Nguyen and conservative Christians after an article appeared on &quot;The Christian Post&quot; on September 13, 2007. After seeing the article, Nguyen wrote an impassioned response in her blog on September 28, 2007, criticizing churches for &quot;bashing&quot; the gay community while thanking God for saving her life. The show premiered for a second season in April 2008 and became a popular gossip subject in Asian media, such as &quot;AsianWeek&quot;. The season finale premiered July 8, 2008, the winner being Kristy Morgan, who declined her &quot;shot at love&quot;.

On October 9, 2007, Nguyen released her second official single, &quot;Stripper Friends&quot;. A video premiered via Yahoo! Music on February 26, 2008, and was released to iTunes on March 4, 2008. The single failed to chart. In April 2008, the single &quot;Paralyze&quot; and its accompanying music video were released via Yahoo! Music and iTunes. The &quot;I Love U Remixes&quot; EP was released to digital music retailers on April 7, 2009. On December 2, 2008, Nguyen released a self-help book, &quot;Hooking Up with Tila Tequila: A Guide to Love, Fame, Happiness, Success, and Being the Life of the Party&quot; ().

===2010–2014: &quot;Welcome to the Darkside&quot; and hiatus===

By 2010, Tequila decided to reinvent her image and changed her stage name to Miss Tila. Her first single released under the new moniker was &quot;I Fucked the DJ&quot;, along with an edited version entitled &quot;I Love My DJ&quot;. Released under her newly established label Little Miss Trendsetter, the single received negative reviews and failed to be successful in charts. In May, she launched her celebrity gossip blog, MissTilaOMG.com, and the EP, &quot;Welcome to the Darkside&quot;, which marked a musical departure from her previous material. Influenced by classical music and artists such as Nina Simone and Billie Holiday, &quot;Welcome to the Darkside&quot; received more positive reviews. However, it did not manage to gain commercial success.

Tequila began a tour supporting the new EP and at one of her tour stops in August 2010, she appeared at the Gathering of the Juggalos, a music festival founded by hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse. She was repeatedly pelted with rocks and bottles among other objects, and she vowed to take legal action against the organizers and promoters for the event.

During this time, a sex tape featuring a lesbian threesome in which she performed was leaked. Tequila tried to buy back the tape before its release, but could not come to terms with Vivid Entertainment. She later starred in a sex tape that won a 2015 AVN Award for &quot;Best Celebrity Sex Tape&quot;.

===2015–present: &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; and return to music===
In May 2015, it was announced that Nguyen was working on new music. In June, she posted a snippet of the song &quot;Drunk Dialing&quot; on her Instagram and wrote it would be released in the Summer. In August, she became one of the contestants on the sixteenth season of Channel 5 reality series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. However, she was ejected from the house after just one day, due to many viewer complaints of her controversial statements made in 2013, when she posted anti-Semitic comments and praised Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler on Facebook. Tequila posted a snippet of &quot;Drunk Dialing&quot; again in September and confirmed it would be released by the end of October along with a music video. In November, Tequila and her management confirmed the single would be released on December 4. Tequila also announced her own line of e-liquids for vaporizers in collaboration with Blaze Vapors. In 2018, she began using another stage name, Tornado Thien.

In 2019, she took to Youtube to announce a Gospel album, and that she would use GoFundme to raise money to produce it.

=== Online ventures ===
In July 2001, Nguyen started the website TilasHotSpot.com, which later began redirecting to MissTila.com. Originally the site featured information, quotes, blog, and pictorials requiring adult verification and a monthly fee. Later, the site was revamped to feature all-ages content and information to promote her career, business ventures, personal information, and a premium membership section including videos, non-nude picture galleries, blogs, and chat sessions. In 2008 the site was transformed into a social network.

During 2005, Nguyen launched TilaFashion.com, a site featuring her custom line of clothing for men and women. In 2006, Nguyen created another website, TilaZone.com which features content to use on Myspace and other social networking websites including layouts, widgets, and clipart.

In December 2009, Nguyen partnered with Joe Francis to launch the now-defunct dating website TilasHotSpotDating.com, aimed at people ages 18 and up. The site included a free membership with basic access, and paid membership for other areas of the site. Nguyen took in webcam chats on the site.

In 2010, Nguyen launched a celebrity blog site, MissTilaOMG.com; it transformed into her personal blog in 2012.

As of 2018, Nguyen sells artwork online under the name of Tornado Thien.

==Public image==
Nguyen was featured on the cover of the April 2006 issue of &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine; in the interview, she claimed that her nickname &quot;Tila Tequila&quot; came about when she experimented with alcohol at the age of 13. She appeared on the August 2006 &quot;Maxim&quot; UK cover, was named #88 in their Hot 100 List, and also appeared in the December 2007 issue. She was ranked #100 on the &quot;Maxim&quot; Hot 100 list in 2008.

Nguyen has been featured on the front page of magazines such as &quot;Penthouse&quot;, &quot;King&quot;, &quot;Blender&quot;, and most recently &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;.

==Political views==
In December 2013, Nguyen posted an article on her website titled &quot;Why I Sympathize with Hitler: Part I&quot;. In the post she calls Hitler &quot;a good man&quot; and additionally a “man of compassion.” Additionally, she also posted a photo of herself with a Nazi armband, posing with a gun in front of a photo of the Auschwitz concentration camp. In other posts, she also said that she believes that Eastern European Jewish people are descended from the Khazar people. On her blog she also claimed that Elisa Lam and Paul Walker were killed in &quot;ritualistic murders&quot;.

In 2015, she endorsed Donald Trump for President and cited his opposition to Trans-Pacific Partnership as a reason.

In August 2015, Tequila became a contestant in the sixteenth series of British television reality game show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, but was asked to leave the program on its second day when producers became aware of her comments about Hitler and photos. She subsequently apologized for her earlier comments, blaming them on depression and drug addiction saying that she is “deeply sorry for my irresponsible, reckless and selfish actions and I hope that everyone can forgive me for the pain that I may have caused.”

On May 6, 2016, Nguyen tweeted that Jewish-American political commentator Ben Shapiro should &quot;be gassed and sent back to Israel&quot; and later posted that &quot;There are only two things in this world, for which I would gladly sacrifice my own life; the destruction of all Jews and preservation of the white race&quot; and &quot;You know what will help Asians earn respect? An Asian version of Adolf Hitler… I want that person to be me; I want to save the world from this Zionist disease!&quot;.

In June 2016, Tila Tequila accused Sarah Silverman and the Jews of killing Jesus before saying the comedian was next on a &quot;celebrity sacrifice&quot; list.

She has made associations with the alt-right and neo-Nazism. On November 19, 2016, she attended an alt-right National Policy Institute meeting celebrating the election of Donald Trump, organized by white supremacist Richard B. Spencer, and posted photos on social media of herself doing a Nazi salute. One was posted to Twitter with the text &quot;Seig heil!&quot; [sic] and a raised hand. On November 22, 2016, her account was suspended by Twitter. Consequently, she joined Gab.

She has expressed her views on several scientific topics as well. Tequila released a video on YouTube expressing anti-vaccine views saying &quot;vaccines causes 240% of black boys to have Autism.&quot; She has also expressed her belief that the Earth is not a sphere but is flat.

==Personal life==

=== Health ===
On March 7, 2012, it was reported that Tequila had agreed to check into rehab after having reportedly &quot;almost died&quot; from an attempted suicide by overdosing on pills. The incident caused her to be hospitalized from a brain aneurysm. Tequila completed her rehab treatment on April 5, 2012.

=== Sexuality ===
By the end of 2007, Tequila was linked to the winner of her dating show &quot;A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila&quot;, Bobby Banhart. In January 2008, she revealed that she and Banhart had ended their relationship. Shortly afterwards, Banhart posted a message on his Myspace stating he had never dated Tequila and that she &quot;never called him after the last show and no one would give him her number.&quot; Tequila later came out as a lesbian rather than a bisexual and stated that she wanted to pick the show&#x27;s runner-up Dani Campbell but the producers made her pick Banhart.

In March 2018, Tequila uploaded a video to YouTube, saying that she was neither lesbian nor bisexual. She only pretended to be lesbian and bisexual in order to create ratings for &quot;A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila&quot;; she had a boyfriend while filming the show. Additionally, she associated homosexuality with the Devil and referred to former contestants of the show as &quot;degenerate&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;.

=== Relationships and children ===
On December 9, 2009, Tequila stated she was engaged to heiress Casey Johnson, daughter of businessman Woody Johnson, and was photographed with a diamond ring. Johnson died on January 4, 2010, of complications resulting from diabetic ketoacidosis.

Tequila began dating musician Thomas Paxton Whitaker (born 1971) in 2013, which ended due to Whitaker&#x27;s financial problems. On April 18, 2014, Tequila confirmed her pregnancy on her Facebook page. Tequila gave birth to her first daughter on November 16, 2014.

In September 2018, Tequila gave birth to her second child, also a daughter.

=== Legal issues ===
On September 6, 2009, Tequila was allegedly strangled and restrained by former boyfriend Shawne Merriman, who was later arrested. San Diego district attorney Bonnie Dumanis decided not to charge Merriman after her office spent three days reviewing reports from the San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. On November 17, 2009, Tequila sued Merriman for $1.5 million. Several weeks later, Merriman countersued, alleging intentional interference with contract, unfair competition, and trademark infringement. She declined to respond to his more recent actions and a default judgment was entered in his favor for $2 million. However, the default judgment was later set aside in January 2010. In February 2010, both sides jointly moved the court to dismiss the claim, and the court dismissed the case on the same day.

<doc id="737695" wikidata="Q776873" url="?curid=737695" title="Kaskaskia River">
<text>The Kaskaskia River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately long, in central and southern Illinois in the United States. The second largest river system within Illinois, it drains a rural area of farms, as well as rolling hills along river bottoms of hardwood forests in its lower reaches. The lower reaches of the river have been canalized to allow barge traffic. In 1819, Vandalia up the river in the interior of the then new state of Illinois was chosen as its capital, which it served as until 1839.

&quot;Cascasquia&quot; is an alternative, supposedly more French, spelling of &quot;Kaskaskia&quot; that is sometimes encountered. It was named after a clan of the Illiniwek encountered by the early French Jesuits and other settlers. &quot;Okaw River&quot; was an alternative name for the Kaskaskia that persists in place names along the river, including Okawville, and in a major tributary, the West Okaw River.

==Hydrography==
The Kaskaskia rises in east central Illinois in several farm ditches along the west side of Champaign. The headwaters of the river is just north of Interstate 74, where it is marked with a sign. The river flows south across rural Champaign and Douglas counties, then southwest across southern Illinois, past Vandalia. It joins the Mississippi from the north approximately northwest of Chester and south-southeast of St. Louis, Missouri. The watershed of the river encompasses approximately , approximately 10.2% of the state of Illinois.

The Kaskaskia is impounded in Shelby County to form Lake Shelbyville. It is also impounded in Clinton County southwest of Vandalia to form Carlyle Lake.

For most of the 19th century, the river joined the Mississippi at Chester. Deforestation of river banks of the Mississippi and tributaries to fuel the hundreds of steamboats that plied the river had several significant environmental effects: destabilizing the banks, causing the Mississippi to become wider and more shallow, causing more severe flooding and leading to lateral channel changes in the American Bottoms area. In the aftermath of a major 1881 flood, the Mississippi changed its channel and moved east to flow along the lower of the channel of the Kaskaskia, shifting the confluence 10 miles north. As a result, a small portion of Illinois, including the former capital, Kaskaskia, was cut off from Illinois when the river moved to its east side. It is now located on the west side of the Mississippi. The community of Kaskaskia can now only be reached from the Missouri shore. The Kaskaskia River State Fish &amp; Wildlife Area is located along the lower river in southern Illinois.

Fort Kaskaskia was located near the mouth of the river in Randolph County.

<doc id="737696" wikidata="Q2894099" url="?curid=737696" title="1997 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1997 Atlantic hurricane season was a below-average hurricane season. It officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30 of that year. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The 1997 season was fairly inactive, with only seven named storms forming, with an additional tropical depression and an unnumbered subtropical storm. It was the first time since the 1961 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the entire month of August—historically one of the more active months of the season—a phenomenon that would not occur again until 2022. A strong El Niño is credited with reducing activity in the Atlantic, while increasing the number of storms in the eastern and western Pacific basins to 19 and 26 storms, respectively. As is common in El Niño years, tropical cyclogenesis was suppressed in the tropical latitudes, with only two becoming tropical storms south of 25°N.

The first system, an operationally unnoticed subtropical storm, developed north of the Bahamas on June 1 and dissipated by the following day without any impact. Tropical Storm Ana developed offshore South Carolina on June 30 and dissipated on July 4, after causing minor affects in North Carolina. Hurricane Bill was a short-lived storm that lasted from July 11 to July 13 and produced light rainfall in Newfoundland. As Bill was dissipating, Tropical Storm Claudette developed and generated rough seas in North Carolina. The most devastating storm was Hurricane Danny, which caused extensive flooding, particularly in southern Alabama. Danny resulted in 9 fatalities and about $100 million (1997 USD) in damage. The outer bands of Hurricane Erika brought rough seas and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles, resulting in two deaths and $10 million in losses. The precursor to Tropical Storm Grace caused flooding in Puerto Rico, while Tropical Depression Five and Tropical Storm Fabian did not impact any land. Collectively, the storms of the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 12 fatalities and approximately $111.46 million in damages.

== Seasonal forecasts ==
Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). As stated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981–2010 contained roughly twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, three major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 66–103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, of below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.

CSU&#x27;s first outlook for the season, issued in December 1996, predicted eleven named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, which are defined as a tropical cyclone reaching at least a Category 3 rating on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. These numbers went unchanged during their forecast updates released in April and May. CSU issued these predictions based on the possibility of El Niño weakening, a cessation of drought conditions over the Sahel, and nearly identical trade wind and atmospheric pressure patterns compared to the previous season. In August, however, CSU slightly decreased their predicted number of hurricanes and major hurricanes to six and two, respectively, after the El Niño strengthened instead. In early 1997, the WRC anticipated a less active season, forecasting seven named storms and four hurricanes, but issuing no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.
== Seasonal summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, and an unnamed subtropical storm developed on the same day. Only nine tropical depressions formed. Eight of the depressions attained tropical storm status, making 1997 the least active Atlantic hurricane season in the ongoing above-average era of tropical cyclogenesis, which began in 1995. Just three of these systems attained hurricane status and only one tropical cyclone intensified into a major hurricane, which was below the 1981–2010 average of three per season. Only Danny made landfall at hurricane strength during the season, although Hurricane Erika and Tropical Storm Grace also caused damage and fatalities. Those three cyclones collectively caused 12 deaths and $111.46 million in damage. The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Grace, dissipated on October 17, over a month before the official end of the season on November 30.

The 1997 Atlantic hurricane season had a very active beginning. In June, two tropical cyclones developed – the unnoticed subtropical storm and Tropical Storm Ana. An unusual four tropical cyclones formed in the month of July, three of which reached tropical storm intensity, and two of them became hurricanes. Despite the active start, the other months of the season featured record low activity, especially in August and September, both of which combined produced only one tropical cyclone. As a result of the active start and subsequent lack of activity, it showed that early season activity has no correlation to the entire season. Further, this marked the first occurrence of no tropical cyclogenesis in August since 1961, and the most recent instance of no activity in that month until 2022. The lone tropical cyclone during the period was Hurricane Erika, which developed on September 3. In October, two short-lived tropical cyclones developed, Fabian and Grace. Tropical cyclogenesis ceased after Grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 17.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a low accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 41. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Unnumbered subtropical storm ===

A cluster of thunderstorms developed over Florida in late May. A shortwave trough brought it to the northeast, enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation. The low pressure area, which formed on May 31, developed into a subtropical depression on June 1. Operationally, it was treated as a frontal low, but post-analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime, and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm. It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The convection continued to wrap around the center, and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify. Late on June 1, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) while off the coast of North Carolina. The storm turned to the east, and transitioned extratropical late on June 2 southeast of Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of the storm merged with a cold front.
=== Tropical Storm Ana ===

A frontal low pressure system off the coast of South Carolina developed into Tropical Depression One at 1200 UTC on June 30. It moved slowly eastward, and attained tropical storm status on July 1. After becoming a tropical storm, Ana slightly intensified. Early on July 2, Ana attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of . Later on July 2, a shortwave trough forced Ana to northeastward, into a region of increasing vertical wind shear. Simultaneously, Ana began to weaken, as it was moving into an area of decreasing sea surface temperatures.

By late on July 3, Ana weakened to a tropical depression. The storm also lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on July 4, over the western Atlantic Ocean. The extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating about twenty-four hours later. Minimal impact was reported as a result of Ana, other than rip currents in coastal North Carolina. Due to the rough seas, 14 rescues and one serious injury occurred at Carolina Beach. In addition, five rescues were made at Kure Beach and at least one person was hospitalized. However, there were no fatalities at either location.
=== Hurricane Bill ===

A large upper-level low separated from a trough north of Puerto Rico in early July. Convection increased on July 7 after a surface trough developed, and a low pressure area formed east of the Bahamas once the upper-level low retreated to the southwest. Wind shear decreased across the region, allowing the convection to increase and organize, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on July 11 about 330 mi (530 km) southwest of Bermuda. After developing, the cyclone moved northeastward in advance of an approaching cold front. It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Bill, and briefly threatened to pass near Bermuda. As a result, a tropical storm warning was issued, although it was quickly dropped; there was no impact on the island from Bill.

Bill quickly intensified as it continued northeastward. By midday on July 12, an eye feature was observed on satellite images, which suggested that Bill intensified into hurricane status at a relatively high latitude. Bill had in fact intensified into a hurricane, and the storm had attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . After only 12 hours at hurricane status, Bill weakened back to tropical storm status, and on July 13 was absorbed by the cold front about south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Bill dropped very light rainfall on Newfoundland, peaking at slightly less than 1 in (25 mm).
=== Tropical Storm Claudette ===

The frontal system that influenced the track of Hurricane Bill spawned a non-tropical low off the southeast United States on July 11. The low remained nearly stationary as the front dissipated, and it developed into Tropical Depression Three on July 13 about south-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Claudette, based on reconnaissance aircraft data. It moved northeastward, passing southeast of the Outer Banks. Despite the presence of wind shear it developed banding features. On July 14, the storm reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Thereafter, Claudette turned eastward ahead of a frontal system.

Its associated thunderstorm activity was sporadic and relatively disorganized, and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on July 16. Claudette briefly re-intensified into a tropical storm before becoming extratropical later that day. Shortly thereafter, it merged with a cold front, while the remnants were last noted near the Azores on July 23. Tropical Storm Claudette had minimal effects on land. Severe rip currents from Claudette in North Carolina caused several rescues and one person was injured, although no fatalities occurred. Some residents of coastal North Carolina were even disappointed that Claudette was to remain offshore, as the region was suffering from dry conditions.
=== Hurricane Danny ===
A tropical low over the northern Gulf of Mexico developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16. The depression headed slowly east-northeastward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Danny on the following day. Danny continued east-northeastward, and reached hurricane strength just before landfall near Buras, Louisiana. Because of the narrowness of that piece of land, most of Danny remained over water and it lost little strength. Danny re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened slightly making two landfalls in Alabama as a low-end Category 1 hurricane on July 19. After remaining stationary for a day, Danny moved northward and weakened to a tropical depression. Heading northward across Alabama, Danny turned to the east and crossed over the Southeastern United States. While centered over North Carolina, Danny interacted with a developing trough, which caused it to re-intensify into a tropical storm. Shortly thereafter, Danny emerged over the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina–Virginia border on July 24. Danny took a northward turn, and came within of Nantucket Island on July 26. It then turned out to sea and was absorbed by a front on July 27.

Although Danny was a hurricane upon landfall, strong winds were confined to a small area, with only portions of extreme eastern Louisiana reporting hurricane-force winds. Danny also dropped torrential amounts of rain in Louisiana, peaking at in Buras-Triumph. Flooding occurred in portions of the state due to heavy rainfall. The floods and high winds produced by Danny damaged over 300 houses and more than 170 businesses in Louisiana alone. In Mississippi, Danny dropped heavy rainfall on the southern portion of the state, resulting in minor street and house flooding. As Danny crossed Dauphin Island, Alabama on July 19, it dropped of rain. This made Danny the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Alabama. Hurricane force-winds were reported on Dauphin Island and the western shores of Mobile Bay. In the same area, many buildings had sustained roof damage. In addition, many homes on the Fowl and Fish Rivers reported significant damage. Further north in South Carolina and Virginia, Danny spawned several tornadoes; some of them caused significant damage. Heavy rainfall also occurred in some isolated areas; in central North Carolina between 8–12 in (200–300 mm) of rain was reported. Danny eventually affected Massachusetts, bring light rainfall and tropical storm-force winds to the southeastern portions of the state. Overall, Danny caused nine fatalities, and approximately $100 million in damage.
=== Tropical Depression Five ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 11. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, and finally began to show consistent evidence of a cloud system center. Deep convection associated with the wave became concentrated on satellite images on July 17, and it is estimated that the disturbance became Tropical Depression Five around 0600 UTC on that day while centered about east of Barbados. The tropical depression moved west-northwestward and started showing signs of falling apart on July 18. Early on the following day, the depression degenerated into a tropical wave. Recon observations before the storm fell apart suggested that it may have briefly reached tropical storm strength. The tropical wave continued westward without regenerating and lost its identity on July 23 over the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
=== Hurricane Erika ===
A tropical wave, which would later also develop Hurricane Nora, developed into Tropical Depression Six while it was centered about 1,150 mi (1,850 km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles on September 3. Later that day, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Erika. It moved west-northwestward and steadily intensified to attain hurricane status on September 4. Erika passed a short distance to the north of the Lesser Antilles, and later turned to the north in response to an approaching trough. The hurricane quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on September 8, and after maintaining peak strength for 24 hours Erika weakened over cooler waters. It turned to the east, weakened to a tropical storm, and became extratropical after passing near the Azores on September 15.

The hurricane produced light rainfall and winds throughout the northern Lesser Antilles. The passage of Erika brought a cloud of ash to Antigua from the eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat, a rare occurrence. Strong waves from the hurricane produced beach erosion and coastal flooding in northern Puerto Rico, and killed two surfers. Moderate wind gusts in Puerto Rico left thousands without power, and the hurricane resulted in $10 million in damage to the Caribbean territory of the United States. Erika also produced gusty winds and light rain in the Azores. Later in its duration, the storm brought hurricane-force wind gusts and rainfall to the Azores, though no damage was reported. Erika was the only tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin in the month of September in this year, the first such occurrence in a hurricane season since 1929.
=== Tropical Storm Fabian ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September 22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving in the same direction as the upper-level winds.

At 1800 UTC October 4, it is estimated that system developed into Tropical Depression Seven, while north of Puerto Rico. However, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories until 1500 UTC on October 7. The depression strengthened and about 24 hours after forming, it became Tropical Storm Fabian later on October 5. No further significant change in intensity occurred for the remainder of its duration, as Fabian had peaked with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The storm began losing tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 1200 UTC on October 8.
=== Tropical Storm Grace ===

An extratropical low formed just north of Hispaniola on October 14, and on the following day, it attained gale-force winds. In addition, the system was also acquiring tropical characteristics, and was classified as Tropical Storm Grace on October 16 at 0000 UTC. Strong vertical wind shear prevented further intensification, and Grace immediately peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Though Grace was classified as a tropical cyclone, it still held onto some extratropical characteristics. Thereafter, Grace steadily weakened and eventually degenerated into an extratropical low on October 17.

The precursor disturbance of Grace dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at in Aibonito. As a result, flash flooding occurred throughout the island of Puerto Rico, while landslides caused damage to roads and bridges. In addition, numerous rivers overflowed their banks, which forced 37 people to seek shelter across the island. One fatality occurred, and damage amounted to $1.46 million. In addition, the extratropical system produced light to moderate rainfall in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and precipitation reached along western sides of the islands.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1997. This is the same list used for the 1991 season, except for &quot;Bill&quot;, which replaced &quot;Bob&quot;. A storm was named &quot;Bill&quot; for the first time in 1997. There were no names retired from this list after the season, so it was used again for the 2003 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1997 USD.

<doc id="737700" wikidata="Q6946654" url="?curid=737700" title="My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117">
<text>My Wrongs #8245–8249 &amp; 117 is a 2002 British short film written and directed by Chris Morris, starring Paddy Considine as a mentally disturbed man taking care of a friend&#x27;s Doberman Pinscher (named Rothko, and voiced by Morris) while she is away. The dog talks to him and convinces him that he is on trial for everything he has done wrong in his life, and the dog is his lawyer.

This was the first film by Warp Films, an imprint of British record label Warp Records. It was released on DVD in 2003, on a region 0, PAL disc. The disc featured a false commentary track, among other bonuses. The packaging included a list of various wrongs committed by the protagonist, although one would have to destroy the case to read them all. The title comes from this tendency of the protagonist to record his sins: the film depicts numbers 8245–8249 in the timeline, and number 117, which was an unguarded comment made as a small boy, in a flashback.

==Plot==
The protagonist (Paddy Considine) is a man tasked with looking after his friend Imogen&#x27;s house, and is instructed to take her dog Rothko for walks, but not to let him off the leash. After putting Imogen&#x27;s keys through the mail slot in her door (so they do not get lost), the man ensures that he will not lose Rothko by tying the dog&#x27;s leash around his own neck. Rothko leads him to a park, where he viciously attacks and kills a duck in front of onlookers. As they shout at the man, Rothko (Chris Morris) begins to speak to him, taunting him.

The pair run away onto a bus, where the dog tells the man that he is his lawyer and is defending everything the man has ever done wrong. The man recalls a time where he was spoken to similarly by a gerbil as a child, telling him his father was cheating on his mother. The man and dog are kicked off the bus after the conductor finds out the man has no money.

The dog, enticed by a little girl&#x27;s used handkerchief, follows her into a church, dragging the man with him. Inside, a christening is going on, and the dog tells the man he has brought him here for forgiveness for what he is about to do. The baby being christened speaks to the man, telling him to speak up and tell everyone in attendance that the priest is a paedophile and the baby&#x27;s mother is a prostitute. Urged on by Rothko, the man does so, only for the baby to say, &quot;Only joking!&quot;

In the resulting commotion, the priest is knocked over, the baby is sent flying, and Rothko breaks free. The man catches the baby and chases Rothko out of the church, only to see the dog struck by a vehicle. The dying dog tells the man that he should now seek out legal counsel from the baby before he dies. When the man asks to speak to the baby, the baby&#x27;s father punches him.

In a closing monologue, the man reveals he left a note to Imogen apologizing for the keys and dog, and imagines her being satisfied with it, but he is sure she is not. He no longer goes to the park, as he hears the ducks tell passers-by that he thought a dog could talk, and they refuse to stop when he tells them to.

==Production==
The short film was based on a monologue from Chris Morris&#x27; earlier radio programme &quot;Blue Jam&quot;, and was attempted as a sketch in the television adaptation &quot;Jam&quot;. The sketch was omitted from &quot;Jam&quot;, but very short clips were edited into the TV series (there are small sections before the last sketches in episodes 1 and 6, showing the man running after the dog, with the leash around his neck). The film omits a scene from the monologue in which the protagonist tries to order food for Rothko at a cafe, and changes Rothko from an Irish wolfhound to a Doberman pinscher. A couple of actors featured in &quot;Jam&quot; appear in cameo form and uncredited - Mark Heap is seen as a park warden, while Kevin Eldon is the man&#x27;s father in a flashback.

The film won a BAFTA for best short film at the 2003 awards.

<doc id="737701" wikidata="Q862099" url="?curid=737701" title="1993 Russian constitutional crisis">
<text>In September and October 1993, a constitutional crisis arose in the Russian Federation from a conflict between the then Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the country&#x27;s parliament. Yeltsin performed a self-coup, dissolving parliament and instituting a presidential rule by decree system. The crisis ended with Yeltsin using military force to attack Moscow&#x27;s House of Soviets and arrest the lawmakers. In Russia, the events are known as the &quot;October Coup&quot; () or &quot;Black October&quot; ().

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the Russian Federation became an independent country. The Soviet-era 1978 Russian constitution remained in effect, though it had been amended in April 1991 to install a President independent of the parliament. Boris Yeltsin, elected President in July 1991, began assuming increasing powers, leading to a political standoff with Russia&#x27;s parliament, which in 1993 was composed of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and the Supreme Soviet. After holding a four-part referendum in April on support for his leadership and socio-economical policies, as well as on support for early elections, Yeltsin called for parliamentary elections and dissolved the legislature on 21 September in a move not authorized by the constitution, nor approved by the referendum.

On 23 September, the parliament (led by Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov) impeached Yeltsin, proclaimed vice president Alexander Rutskoy the acting president, and barricaded itself in the White House building. Ten days of street fighting commenced between police and demonstrators loyal to Yeltsin and the parliamentarians. On 3 October, demonstrators removed militia cordons around the parliament and, urged by their leaders, took over the mayor&#x27;s offices and tried to storm the Ostankino television centre. On 4 October, the army, which had remained neutral, shelled the White House using tanks and stormed the building with special forces on Yeltsin&#x27;s orders, arresting the surviving leaders of the resistance. All of those involved in the events were later granted amnesty by the State Duma in February 1994 and released from jail.

At the climax of the crisis, Russia was thought by some to be &quot;on the brink&quot; of civil war. The ten-day conflict became the deadliest single event of street fighting in Moscow&#x27;s history since the October Revolution; 147 people were killed and 437 wounded according to the official Russian government statistics. In the wake of the events, Yeltsin consolidated his position, further expanded the powers of the executive, and pushed through the adoption of the 1993 constitution of the Russian Federation.

==Origins==
===Intensifying executive–legislative power struggle===
The Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991 and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic gained its independence as the Russian Federation. In Russia, Yeltsin&#x27;s economic reform program took effect on 2 January 1992. Soon afterward, prices skyrocketed, government spending was slashed, and heavy new taxes went into effect. A deep credit crunch shut down many industries and led to a protracted depression. As a result, unemployment reached record levels. The program began to lose support, and the ensuing political confrontation between Yeltsin on one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform on the other, became increasingly centered in the two branches of government.

Throughout 1992, opposition to Yeltsin&#x27;s reform policies grew stronger and more intractable among bureaucrats concerned about the condition of Russian industry and among regional leaders who wanted more independence from Moscow. Russia&#x27;s vice president, Alexander Rutskoy, denounced the Yeltsin program as &quot;economic genocide&quot;. From 1991 to 1998, the first seven years of Yeltsin&#x27;s incumbency, the Russian GDP (measured by purchasing power parity) went from over two trillion U.S. dollars annually to less than one and a quarter trillion U.S. per annum. The United States provided an estimated $2.58 billion of official aid to Russia during the eight years of Clinton&#x27;s presidency, to build a new economic system, and he encouraged American businesses to invest. Leaders of oil-rich republics such as Tatarstan and Bashkiria called for full independence from Russia.

Also throughout 1992, Yeltsin wrestled with the Supreme Soviet (the standing legislature) and the Russian Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies (the country&#x27;s highest legislative body, from which the Supreme Soviet members were drawn) for control over government and government policy. In 1992 the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, Ruslan Khasbulatov, came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin&#x27;s overall goals.

The president was concerned about the terms of the constitutional amendments passed in late 1991, which meant that his special powers of decree were set to expire by the end of 1992 (Yeltsin expanded the powers of the presidency beyond normal constitutional limits in carrying out the reform program). Yeltsin, awaiting implementation of his privatization program, demanded that parliament reinstate his decree powers (only parliament had the authority to replace or amend the constitution). In the Russian Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and in the Supreme Soviet, the deputies refused to adopt a new constitution that would enshrine the scope of presidential powers demanded by Yeltsin into law.

Another cause of conflict also called repeated refusal of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies to ratify the Belovezha Accords on the termination of the existence of the USSR, and to exclude from the text of the Constitution of the RSFSR of 1978 references to the Constitution and laws of the USSR.

====Seventh Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies====
During its December session, the parliament clashed with Yeltsin on a number of issues, and the conflict came to a head on 9 December when the parliament refused to confirm Yegor Gaidar, the widely unpopular architect of Russia&#x27;s &quot;shock therapy&quot; market liberalizations, as prime minister. The parliament refused to nominate Gaidar, demanding modifications of the economic program and directed the Central Bank, which was under the parliament&#x27;s control, to continue issuing credits to enterprises to keep them from shutting down.

In an angry speech the next day on 10 December, Yeltsin accused the Congress of blocking the government&#x27;s reforms and suggested the people decide on a referendum, &quot;which course do the citizens of Russia support? The course of the President, a course of transformations, or the course of the Congress, the Supreme Soviet and its Chairman, a course towards folding up reforms, and ultimately towards the deepening of the crisis.&quot; Parliament responded by voting to take control of the army.

On 12 December, Yeltsin and parliament speaker Khasbulatov agreed on a compromise that included the following provisions: (1) a national referendum on framing a new Russian constitution to be held in April 1993; (2) most of Yeltsin&#x27;s emergency powers were extended until the referendum; (3) the parliament asserted its right to nominate and vote on its own choices for prime minister; and (4) the parliament asserted its right to reject the president&#x27;s choices to head the Defense, Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Security ministries. Yeltsin nominated Viktor Chernomyrdin to be prime minister on 14 December, and the parliament confirmed him.

Yeltsin&#x27;s December 1992 compromise with the seventh Congress of the People&#x27;s Deputies temporarily backfired. Early 1993 saw increasing tension between Yeltsin and the parliament over the language of the referendum and power sharing. In a series of collisions over policy, the congress whittled away the president&#x27;s extraordinary powers, which it had granted him in late 1991. The legislature, marshaled by Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, began to sense that it could block and even defeat the president. The tactic that it adopted was gradually to erode presidential control over the government. In response, the president called a referendum on a constitution for 11 April.

====Eighth congress====
The eighth Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies opened on 10 March 1993, with a strong attack on the president by Khasbulatov, who accused Yeltsin of acting unconstitutionally. In mid-March, an emergency session of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies voted to amend the constitution, strip Yeltsin of many of his powers, and cancel the scheduled April referendum, again opening the door to legislation that would shift the balance of power away from the president. The president stalked out of the congress. Vladimir Shumeyko, first deputy prime minister, declared that the referendum would go ahead, but on 25 April.

The parliament was gradually expanding its influence over the government. On 16 March, the president signed a decree that conferred Cabinet rank on Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, and three other officials; this was in accordance with the decision of the eighth congress that these officials should be members of the government. The congress&#x27; ruling, however, had made it clear that as ministers they would continue to be subordinate to parliament. In general, the parliament&#x27;s lawmaking activity decreased in 1993, as its agenda increasingly became dominated by efforts to increase the parliamentarian powers and reduce those of the president.

====&quot;Special regime&quot;====
The president&#x27;s response was dramatic. On 20 March, Yeltsin addressed the nation directly on television, declaring that he had signed a decree on a &quot;special regime&quot; (Об особом порядке управления до преодоления кризиса власти), under which he would assume extraordinary executive power pending the results of a referendum on the timing of new legislative elections, on a new constitution, and on public confidence in the president and vice-president. Yeltsin also bitterly attacked the parliament, accusing the deputies of trying to restore the Soviet-era order.

Soon after Yeltsin&#x27;s televised address, Valery Zorkin (Chairman of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation), Yuri Voronin (first vice-chairman of the Supreme Soviet), Alexander Rutskoy and Valentin Stepankov (Prosecutor-General) made an address, publicly condemning Yeltsin&#x27;s declaration as unconstitutional. On 23 March, although not yet possessing the signed document, the Constitutional Court ruled that some of the measures proposed in Yeltsin&#x27;s TV address were unconstitutional; however, the decree itself, that was only published a few days later, did not contain unconstitutional steps.

====Ninth congress====

The ninth congress, which opened on 26 March, began with an extraordinary session of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies taking up discussions of emergency measures to defend the constitution, including impeachment of President Yeltsin. Yeltsin conceded that he had made mistakes and reached out to swing voters in parliament. Yeltsin narrowly survived an impeachment vote on March 28, votes for impeachment falling 72 short of the 689 votes needed for a 2/3 majority. The similar proposal to dismiss Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet was defeated by a wider margin (339 in favour of the motion), though 614 deputies had initially been in favour of including the re-election of the chairman in the agenda, a tell-tale sign of the weakness of Khasbulatov&#x27;s own positions (517 votes for would have sufficed to dismiss the speaker).

By the time of the ninth Congress, the legislative branch was dominated by the joint communist–nationalist Russian Unity bloc, which included representatives of the CPRF and the Fatherland faction (communists, retired military personnel, and other deputies of a socialist orientation), Agrarian Union, and the Russia faction led by Sergey Baburin. These groups, together with more centrist groups like Change (Смена), left the opposing bloc of Yeltsin supporters (Democratic Russia and Radical Democrats) in a clear minority.

====National referendum====
The referendum would go ahead, but since the impeachment vote failed, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies sought to set new terms for a popular referendum. The legislature&#x27;s version of the referendum asked whether citizens had confidence in Yeltsin, approved of his reforms, and supported early presidential and legislative elections. The parliament voted that in order to win, the president would need to obtain 50 percent of the whole electorate, rather than 50 percent of those actually voting, to avoid an early presidential election. This time, the Constitutional Court supported Yeltsin and ruled that the president required only a simple majority on two issues: confidence in him, and economic and social policy; he would need the support of half the electorate in order to call new parliamentary and presidential elections.

On 25 April, a majority of voters expressed confidence in the president, and called for new legislative elections. Yeltsin termed the results a mandate for him to continue in power. Before the referendum, Yeltsin had promised to resign, if the electorate failed to express confidence in his policies. Although this permitted the president to declare that the population supported him, not the parliament, Yeltsin lacked a constitutional mechanism to implement his victory. As before, the president had to appeal to the people over the heads of the legislature.

On 1 May, antigovernment protests organized by the hardline opposition turned violent. Numerous deputies of the Supreme Soviet took part in organizing the protest and in its course. One OMON police officer suffered fatal injuries during the riot. As a reaction, a number of the representatives of Saint Petersburg intelligentia (e.g., Oleg Basilashvili, Aleksei German, Boris Strugatsky) sent a petition to president Yeltsin, urging &quot;putting an end to the street criminality under political slogans&quot;.

===Constitutional convention===

On 29 April 1993, Boris Yeltsin released the text of his proposed constitution to a meeting of government ministers and leaders of the republics and regions, according to ITAR-TASS. On 12 May Yeltsin called for a special assembly of the Federation Council, which had been formed 17 July 1990 within the office of the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, and other representatives, including political leaders from a wide range of government institutions, regions, public organizations, and political parties, to finalize a draft for a new constitution from 5–10 June, and was followed by a similar decree 21 May.

After much hesitation, the Constitutional Committee of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies decided to participate and present its own draft constitution. Of course, the two main drafts contained contrary views of legislative–executive relations. Some 700 representatives at the conference ultimately adopted a draft constitution on 12 July that envisaged a bicameral legislature and the dissolution of the congress. But because the convention&#x27;s draft of the constitution would dissolve the congress, there was little likelihood that the congress would vote itself out of existence. The Supreme Soviet immediately rejected the draft and declared that the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies was the supreme lawmaking body and hence would decide on the new constitution.

===July–September===
The parliament was active in July–August, while the president was on vacation, and passed a number of decrees that revised economic policy, in order to &quot;end the division of society&quot;, It also launched investigations of key advisers of the president, accusing them of corruption. The president returned in August and declared that he would deploy all means, including circumventing the constitution, to achieve new parliamentary elections.

In July, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the election of Pyotr Sumin to head the administration of the Chelyabinsk Oblast, something that Yeltsin had refused to accept. As a result, a situation of dual power existed in that region from July to October in 1993, with two administrations claiming legitimacy simultaneously. Another conflict involved the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation regarding the regional presidency in Mordovia. The court delegated the question of legality of abolishing the post of the region&#x27;s president to the Constitutional Court of Mordovia. As a result, popularly elected President Vasily Guslyannikov, member of the pro-Yeltsin Democratic Russia movement, lost his position. Thereafter, the state news agency (ITAR-TASS) ceased to report on a number of Constitutional Court decisions.

The Supreme Soviet also tried to further foreign policies that differed from Yeltsin&#x27;s line. Thus, on 9 July 1993, it passed resolutions on Sevastopol, &quot;confirming the Russian federal status&quot; of the city. Ukraine saw its territorial integrity at stake and filed a complaint to the Security Council of the UN. Yeltsin condemned the resolution of the Supreme Soviet. In August 1993, a commentator reflected on the situation as follows: &quot;The President issues decrees as if there were no Supreme Soviet, and the Supreme Soviet suspends decrees as if there were no President.&quot; (&quot;Izvestiya&quot;, August 13, 1993).

The president launched his offensive on 1 September when he attempted to suspend Vice President Rutskoy, a key adversary. Rutskoy, elected on the same ticket as Yeltsin in 1991, was the president&#x27;s automatic successor. A presidential spokesman said that he had been suspended because of &quot;accusations of corruption&quot;, due to alleged corruption charges, which was not further confirmed. On 3 September, the Supreme Soviet rejected Yeltsin&#x27;s suspension of Rutskoy and referred the question to the Constitutional Court.

Two weeks later, Yeltsin declared that he would agree to call early presidential elections provided that the parliament also called elections. The parliament ignored him. On 18 September, Yeltsin then named Yegor Gaidar, who had been forced out of office by parliamentary opposition in 1992, a deputy prime minister and a deputy premier for economic affairs. This appointment was unacceptable to the Supreme Soviet.

==Siege and assault==
On 21 September, Yeltsin declared the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and the Supreme Soviet dissolved; this act was in contradiction with a number of articles of the Constitution of 1978 (as amended 1989–1993), such as, Article 1216 which stated:

In his television appearance to the citizens of Russia, President Yeltsin argued for the decree nr 1400 as follows:
Already for more than a year attempts were made to reach a compromise with the corps of deputies, with the Supreme Soviet. Russians know well how many steps were taken by my side during the last congresses and between them. ... The last days destroyed once and for all the hopes for a resurrection of at least some constructive cooperation. The majority of the Supreme Soviet is directly against the will of the Russian people. A course was taken in favour of the weakening of the president and ultimately his removal from office, of the disorganization of the work of the government; during the last months, dozens of unpopular decisions have been prepared and passed. ... Many of these were deliberately planned to worsen the situation in Russia. The more flagrant ones are the so-called economic policies of the Supreme Soviet, and its decisions on the budget and privatization; there are many others that deepen the crisis, cause colossal damage to the country. All attempts of the government undertaken to at least somewhat alleviate the economic situation are met with incomprehension. There is hardly a day when the cabinet of ministers is not harassed, its hands are not being tied. And this happens in a situation of a deepest economic crisis. The Supreme Soviet has stopped taking into account the decrees of the president, his amendments of the legislative projects, even his constitutional veto rights. Constitutional reform has practically been pared down. The process of creating rule of law in Russia has essentially been disorganized. On the contrary, what is going on is a deliberate reduction of the legal basis of the young Russian state, which is weak enough without this. The legislative work became a weapon of political struggle. Laws, that Russia urgently needs, are being delayed for years. ...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;For a long time, most of the sessions of the Supreme Soviet take place with infringements of elementary procedures and order... A cleansing of committees and commissions is taking place. Everyone who does not show personal loyalty to its leader is being mercilessly expelled from the Supreme Soviet, from its presidium. ... This is all bitter evidence of the fact that the Supreme Soviet as a state institution is currently in a state of decay ... . The power in the Supreme Soviet has been captured by a group of persons who have turned it into an HQ of the intransigent opposition. ... The only way to overcome the paralysis of the state authority in the Russian Federation is its fundamental renewal on the basis of the principles of popular power and constitutionality. The constitution currently in force does not enable this. The constitution in force also does not provide for a procedure of passing a new constitution, that would provide for a worthy exit from the crisis of state power. I as the guarantor of the security of our state have to propose an exit from this deadlock, have to break this vicious circle.

At the same time, Yeltsin repeated his announcement of a constitutional referendum, and new legislative elections for December. He also repudiated the Constitution of 1978, declaring that it had been replaced with one that gave him extraordinary executive powers. According to the new plan, the lower house would have 450 deputies and be called the State Duma, the name of the Russian legislature before the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The Federation Council, which would bring together representatives from the 89 subdivisions of the Russian Federation, would assume the role of an upper house. Yeltsin claimed that by dissolving the Russian parliament in September 1993 he was clearing the tracks for a rapid transition to a functioning market economy. With this pledge, he received strong backing from the leading powers of the West. Yeltsin enjoyed a strong relationship with the Western powers, particularly the United States, but the relationship made him unpopular with many Russians. In Russia, the Yeltsin side had control over television, where hardly any pro-parliament views were expressed during the September–October crisis.

===Parliament purports to impeach Yeltsin as president===
Rutskoy called Yeltsin&#x27;s move a step toward a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. The next day, the Constitutional Court held that Yeltsin had violated the constitution and could be impeached. During an all-night session, chaired by Khasbulatov, parliament declared the president&#x27;s decree null and void. Rutskoy was proclaimed acting president until new elections. He dismissed the key ministers Pavel Grachev (defense), Nikolay Golushko (security), and Viktor Yerin (interior). Russia now had two presidents and two ministers of defense, security, and interior. Although Gennady Zyuganov and other top leaders of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation did not participate in the events, individual members of communist organizations actively supported the parliament.

On 23 September, with the observance of a quorum, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies was convened (the quorum was 638). Congress purported to impeach Yeltsin. The same day, Yeltsin announced presidential elections for June 1994. On 24 September, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies voted to hold simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections by March 1994. Yeltsin scoffed at the parliament-backed proposal for simultaneous elections, and responded the next day by cutting off electricity, phone service, and hot water in the parliament building.

===Mass protests and the barricading of the parliament===
Yeltsin also sparked popular unrest with his dissolution of a Congress and parliament increasingly opposed to his neoliberal economic reforms. Tens of thousands of Russians marched in the streets of Moscow seeking to bolster the parliamentary cause. The demonstrators were protesting against the deteriorating living conditions. Since 1989, the GDP had been declining, corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing and life expectancy falling. Yeltsin was also increasingly getting the blame. It is still hotly debated among Western economists, social scientists, and policy-makers as to whether or not the IMF, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury Department-backed reform policies adopted in Russia, often called &quot;shock therapy&quot;, were responsible for Russia&#x27;s poor record of economic performance in the 1990s or rather that Yeltsin had not gone far enough.

Under the Western-backed economic program adopted by Yeltsin, the Russian government took several radical measures at once that were supposed to stabilize the economy by bringing state spending and revenues into balance and by letting market demand determine the prices and supply of goods. Under the reforms, the government let most prices float, raised taxes, and cut back sharply on spending in industry and construction. These policies caused widespread hardship as many state enterprises found themselves without orders or financing. The rationale of the program was to squeeze the built-in inflationary pressure out of the economy so that the newly privatized producers would begin making sensible decisions about production, pricing and investment instead of chronically overusing resources, as in the Soviet era. By letting the market rather than central planners determine prices, product mixes, output levels, and the like, the reformers intended to create an incentive structure in the economy where efficiency and risk would be rewarded and waste and carelessness were punished. Removing the causes of chronic inflation, the reform&#x27;s architects argued, was a precondition for all other reforms. Hyperinflation would wreck both democracy and economic progress, they argued; only by stabilizing the state budget could the government proceed to restructure the economy. A similar reform program had been adopted in Poland in January 1990, with generally favorable results. However, Western critics of Yeltsin&#x27;s reform, most notably Joseph Stiglitz and Marshall Goldman (who would have favored a more &quot;gradual&quot; transition to market capitalism) consider policies adopted in Poland ill-suited for Russia, given that the impact of communism on the Polish economy and political culture was far less indelible.

Outside Moscow, the Russian masses overall were confused and disorganized. Nonetheless, some of them also tried to voice their protest, and sporadic strikes took place across Russia. The protesters included supporters of various communist (Labour Russia) and nationalist organizations, including those belonging to the National Salvation Front. A number of armed militants of Russian National Unity took part in the defense of the Russian White House, as reportedly did veterans of Tiraspol and Riga OMON. The presence of Transnistrian forces, including the KGB detachment &#x27;Dnestr&#x27;, stirred General Alexander Lebed to protest against Transnistrian interference in Russia&#x27;s internal affairs.

On 28 September, Moscow saw the first bloody clashes between the special police and anti-Yeltsin demonstrators. Also on the same day, the Russian Interior Ministry moved to seal off the parliament building. Barricades and wire were put around the building. On 1 October, the Interior Ministry estimated that 600 fighting men with a large cache of arms had joined Yeltsin&#x27;s political opponents in the parliament building.

===Storming of Ostankino Television Tower===

The Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies still did not discount the prospect of a compromise with Yeltsin. The Russian Orthodox Church acted as a host to desultory discussions between representatives of the Congress and the president. The negotiations with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II as mediator continued until 2 October. On the afternoon of 3 October, the Moscow Municipal Militsiya failed to control a demonstration near the White House, and the political impasse developed into armed conflict.

On 2 October, supporters of parliament constructed barricades and blocked traffic on Moscow&#x27;s main streets. Rutskoy signed a decree that had no practical consequences on the release of Viktor Chernomyrdin from the post of Prime Minister.

On the afternoon of 3 October, armed opponents of Yeltsin successfully stormed the police cordon around the White House territory, where the Russian parliament was barricaded. Paramilitaries from factions supporting the parliament, as well as a few units of the internal military (armed forces normally reporting to the Ministry of Interior), supported the Supreme Soviet.

Rutskoy greeted the crowds from the White House balcony, and urged them to form battalions and to go on to seize the mayor&#x27;s office and the national television center at Ostankino. Khasbulatov also called for the storming of the Kremlin and imprisoning &quot;the criminal and usurper Yeltsin&quot; in Matrosskaya Tishina. At 16:00 Yeltsin signed a decree declaring a state of emergency in Moscow.

On the evening of 3 October, after taking the mayor&#x27;s office located in the former Comecon HQ nearby, pro-parliament demonstrators and gunmen led by General Albert Makashov moved toward Ostankino, the television center. But the pro-parliament crowds were met by Militsiya and OMON forces who took positions in and around the TV complex. A pitched battle followed. Part of the TV center was significantly damaged. Television stations went off the air and 46 people were killed, according to official Russian state estimates, including Terry Michael Duncan, an American lawyer, who was in Moscow to establish a law firm and was killed while attempting to help the wounded. The government originally refused to report the number killed, which led to reports that as many as 1,500 people were killed. Before midnight, the Interior Ministry&#x27;s units had turned back the parliament loyalists.

When broadcasting resumed late in the evening, vice-premier Yegor Gaidar called on television for a meeting in support of democracy and President Yeltsin &quot;so that the country would not be turned yet again into a huge concentration camp&quot;. A number of people with different political convictions and interpretations over the causes of the crisis (such as Grigory Yavlinsky, Alexander Yakovlev, Yury Luzhkov, Ales Adamovich, and Bulat Okudzhava) also appealed to support the President. Similarly, the Civic Union bloc of &#x27;constructive opposition&#x27; issued a statement accusing the Supreme Soviet of having crossed the border separating political struggle from criminality. Several hundred of Yeltsin&#x27;s supporters spent the night in the square in front of the Moscow City Hall preparing for further clashes, only to learn in the morning of 4 October that the army was on their side.

The Ostankino killings went unreported by Russian state television. The only independent Moscow radio station&#x27;s studios were burnt. Two French, one British, and one American journalist were killed by sniper fire during the massacre. A fifth journalist died from a heart attack. The press and broadcast news were censored starting on 4 October, and by the middle of October, prior censorship was replaced by punitive measures.

===Storming of the White House===

Between 2 and 4 October, the position of the army was the deciding factor. The military equivocated for several hours about how to respond to Yeltsin&#x27;s call for action. By this time dozens of people had been killed and hundreds had been wounded. Rutskoy, as a former general, appealed to some of his ex-colleagues. After all, many officers and especially rank-and-file soldiers had little sympathy for Yeltsin. The supporters of the parliament did not send any emissaries to the barracks to recruit lower-ranking officer corps, making the fatal mistake of attempting to deliberate only among high-ranking military officials who already had close ties to parliamentary leaders. In the end, a prevailing bulk of the generals did not want to take their chances with a Rutskoy–Khasbulatov regime. Some generals had stated their intention to back the parliament, but at the last moment moved over to Yeltsin&#x27;s side.

The plan of action was proposed by Captain Gennady Zakharov. Ten tanks were to fire at the upper floors of the White House, with the aim of minimizing casualties but creating confusion and panic amongst the defenders. Five tanks were deployed at Novy Arbat bridge and the other five at Pavlik Morozov playground, behind the building. Then, special troops of the Vympel and Alpha units would storm the parliament premises. According to Yeltsin&#x27;s bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov, firing on the upper floors was also necessary to scare off snipers. By sunrise on 4 October, the Russian army encircled the parliament building, and a few hours later army tanks began to shell the White House, punching holes in the front of it. At 8:00 am Moscow time, Yeltsin&#x27;s declaration was announced by his press service. Yeltsin declared:
Those, who went against the peaceful city and unleashed bloody slaughter, are criminals. But this is not only a crime of individual bandits and pogrom-makers. Everything that took place and is still taking place in Moscow is a pre-planned armed rebellion. It has been organized by Communist revanchists, Fascist leaders, a part of former deputies, and the representatives of the Soviets.

Under the cover of negotiations they gathered forces, recruited bandit troops of mercenaries, who were accustomed to murders and violence. A petty gang of politicians attempted by armed force to impose their will on the entire country. The means by which they wanted to govern Russia have been shown to the entire world. These are cynical lies and bribery. These are cobblestones, sharpened iron rods, automatic weapons and machine guns.

Those, who are waving red flags, again stained Russia with blood. They hoped for the unexpectedness, for the fact that their impudence and unprecedented cruelty will sow fear and confusion.

Yeltsin assured the listeners: &quot;The fascist-communist armed rebellion in Moscow shall be suppressed within the shortest period. The Russian state has necessary forces for this.&quot; By noon, troops entered the White House and began to occupy it, floor by floor. Rutskoy&#x27;s desperate appeal to Air Force pilots to bomb the Kremlin was broadcast by the Echo of Moscow radio station but went unanswered. He also tried to have the Chairman of the Constitutional Court, Valery Zorkin, call the Western embassies to guarantee Rutskoy&#x27;s and his associates&#x27; safety – to no avail. Hostilities were stopped several times to allow some in the White House to leave. By mid-afternoon, popular resistance in the streets was completely suppressed, barring occasional sniper fire.

The &quot;second October Revolution&quot;, as it came to be known, saw the deadliest street fighting in Moscow since 1917. The official list of the dead, presented on July 27, 1994 by the investigation team of the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office of the Russian Federation, includes 147 people: 45 civilians and 1 serviceman in Ostankino, and 77 civilians and 24 military personnel of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the &quot;White House area&quot;.

Some claim Yeltsin was backed by the military only grudgingly, and only at the eleventh hour. The instruments of coercion gained the most, and they would expect Yeltsin to reward them in the future. A paradigmatic example of this was General Pavel Grachev, who had demonstrated his loyalty during this crisis. Grachev became a key political figure, despite many years of charges that he was linked to corruption within the Russian military.

===Public opinion on crisis===

The Russian public opinion research institute VCIOM, a state-controlled agency, conducted a poll in the aftermath of October 1993 events and found out that 70% of the people polled thought that the use of military force by Yeltsin was justified and 30% thought it was not justified. This support for Yeltsin&#x27;s actions declined in later years. When VCIOM-A asked the same question in 2010, only 41% agreed with the use of the military, with 59% opposed. When asked about the main cause of the events of 3–4 October, 46% in the 1993 VCIOM poll blamed Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. Nine years following the crisis, the most popular culprit was the legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev with 36%, closely followed by Yeltsin&#x27;s policies with 32%.

==Yeltsin&#x27;s consolidation of power==

===Immediate aftermath===
On 5 October 1993, the newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; published the open letter &quot;Writers demand decisive actions of the government&quot; to the government and President signed by 42 well-known Russian literati and hence called the Letter of Forty-Two. It was written in reaction to the events and contained the following seven demands: 

In the weeks following the storming of the White House, Yeltsin issued a barrage of presidential decrees intended to consolidate his position. On 5 October, Yeltsin banned political leftist and nationalist organizations and newspapers like &quot;Den&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Sovetskaya Rossiya&quot; and &quot;Pravda&quot; that had supported the parliament (they would later resume publishing). In an address to the nation on 6 October, Yeltsin also called on those regional Soviets that had opposed him – by far the majority – to disband. Valery Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court, was forced to resign. The chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions was also sacked. The anti-Yeltsin TV broadcast &quot;600 Seconds&quot; of Alexander Nevzorov was ultimately closed down.

Yeltsin decreed on 12 October that both houses of parliament would be elected in December. On 15 October, he ordered that a popular referendum be held in December on a new constitution. Rutskoy and Khasbulatov were charged on 15 October with &quot;organizing mass disorders&quot; and imprisoned. On 23 February 1994, the State Duma amnestied all individuals involved in the events of September–October 1993. They were later released in 1994 when Yeltsin&#x27;s position was sufficiently secure. In early 1995, the criminal proceedings were discontinued and were eventually placed into the archives.

&quot;Russia needs order,&quot; Yeltsin told the Russian people in a television broadcast in November in introducing his new draft of the constitution, which was to be put to a referendum on 12 December. The new basic law would concentrate sweeping powers in the hands of the president. The bicameral legislature, to sit for only two years, was restricted in crucial areas. The president could choose the prime minister even if the parliament objected and could appoint the military leadership without parliamentary approval. He would head and appoint the members of a new, more powerful security council. If a vote of no confidence in the government was passed, the president would be enabled to keep it in office for three months and could dissolve the parliament if it repeated the vote. The president could veto any bill passed by a simple majority in the lower house, after which a two-thirds majority would be required for the legislation to be passed. The president could not be impeached for contravening the constitution. The central bank would become independent, but the president would need the approval of the State Duma to appoint the bank&#x27;s governor, who would thereafter be independent of the parliament. At the time, most political observers regarded the draft constitution as shaped by and for Yeltsin and perhaps unlikely to survive him.

===End of the first constitutional period===
On 12 December, Yeltsin managed to push through his new constitution, creating a strong presidency and giving the president sweeping powers to issue decrees; however, the parliament elected on the same day (with a turnout of about 53%) delivered a stunning rebuke to his neoliberal economic program. Candidates identified with Yeltsin&#x27;s economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge protest vote, the bulk of which was divided between the Communists (who mostly drew their support from industrial workers, out-of-work bureaucrats, some professionals, and pensioners) and the ultra-nationalists (who drew their support from disaffected elements of the lower middle classes). Unexpectedly, the most surprising insurgent group proved to be the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky. It gained 23% of the vote while the Gaidar-led Russia&#x27;s Choice received 15.5% and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 12.4%. Zhirinovsky alarmed many observers abroad with his neo-fascist and chauvinist declarations. Nevertheless, the referendum marked the end of the constitutional period defined by the constitution adopted by the Russian SFSR in 1978, which was amended many times while Russia was a part of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s Soviet Union. Although Russia would emerge as a dual presidential–parliamentary system in theory, substantial power would rest in the president&#x27;s hands. Russia now had a prime minister who heads a cabinet and directs the administration. Despite officially following a semi-presidential constitutional model, the system was effectively an example of president–parliamentary presidentialism because the prime minister is appointed and in effect freely dismissed by the president.
