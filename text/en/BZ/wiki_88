<text>In biology, matrix (: matrices) is the material (or tissue) in between a eukaryotic organism&#x27;s cells.

The structure of connective tissues is an extracellular matrix. Fingernails and toenails grow from matrices. It is found in various connective tissues. It serves as a jelly-like structure instead of cytoplasm in connective tissue.

==Tissue matrices==
===Extracellular matrix (ECM)===

The main ingredients of the extracellular matrix are glycoproteins secreted by the cells. The most abundant glycoprotein in the ECM of most animal cells is collagen, which forms strong fibers outside the cells. In fact, collagen accounts for about 40% of the total protein in the human body. The collagen fibers are embedded in a network woven from proteoglycans. A proteoglycan molecule consists of a small core protein with many carbohydrate chains covalently attached, so that it may be up to 95% carbohydrate. Large proteoglycan complexes can form when hundreds of proteoglycans become noncovalently attached to a single long polysaccharide molecule. Some cells are attached to the ECM by still other ECM glycoproteins such as fibronectin. Fibronectin and other ECM proteins bind to cell surface receptor proteins called integrins that are built into the plasma membrane. Integrins span the membrane and bind on the cytoplasmic side to associated proteins attached to microfilaments of the cytoskeleton. The name integrin is based on the word integrate, integrins are in a position to transmit signals between the ECM and the cytoskeleton and thus to integrate changes occurring outside and inside the cell. Current research on fibronectin, other ECM molecules, and integrins is revealing the influential role of the ECM in the lives of cells. By communicating with a cell through integrins, the ECM can regulate a cell&#x27;s behavior. For example, some cells in a developing embryo migrate along specific pathways by matching the orientation of their microfilaments to the &quot;grain&quot; of fibers in the ECM. Researchers are also learning that the ECM around a cell can influence the activity of genes in the nucleus. Information about the ECM probably reaches the nucleus by a combination of mechanical and chemical signaling pathways. Mechanical signaling involves fibronectin, integrins, and microfilaments of the cytoskeleton. Changes in the cytoskeleton may in turn trigger chemical signaling pathways inside the cell, leading to changes in the set of proteins being made by the cell and therefore changes in the cells function. In this way, the ECM of a particular tissue may help coordinate the behavior of all the cells within that tissue. Direct connections between cells also function in this coordination.

===Bone matrix===

Bone is a form of connective tissue found in the body, composed largely of hardened hydroxyapatite-containing collagen. In larger mammals, it is arranged in osteon regions. Bone matrix allows mineral salts such as calcium to be stored and provides protection for internal organs and support for locomotion.

===Cartilage matrix===
Cartilage is another form of connective tissue found in the body, providing a smooth surface for joints and a mechanism for growth of bones during development.

==Subcellular matrices==
===Mitochondrial matrix===

In the mitochondrion, the matrix contains soluble enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of pyruvate and other small organic molecules.

===Nuclear matrix===

In the cell nucleus the matrix is the insoluble fraction that remains after extracting the solubled DNA.

===Golgi matrix===

The Golgi matrix is a protein scaffold around the Golgi apparatus made up of Golgins, GRASP&#x27;s and miscellaneous other proteins on the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi apparatus involved in keeping its shape and membrane stacking.

==Matrix (medium)==
A matrix is also a medium in which bacteria are grown (cultured). For instance, a Petri dish of agar may be the &quot;matrix&quot; for culturing a sample from a patient&#x27;s throat.

<text>Bovekerke is a village in the Belgian province of West Flanders, and since 1971 it&#x27;s a “deelgemeente” of the municipality of Koekelare. Besides the chief town of Koekelare proper, Bovekerke also borders the villages Vladslo (part of Diksmuide) and Werken (part of Kortemark).

Bovekerke has about 1,000 inhabitants. The Roman Catholic parish and church are named after Saint Gertrude. The Saint Gertrude church, with three naves, is built in brick in 1848. Only the octagonal church is left from the late roman church. This tower dates from the 12th century and might be the oldest building in Koekelare, and is a protected monument. During World War I, the tower was used as an observation tower, and the church was used as a hospital.

<text>Fiumicino () is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Rome, Lazio, central Italy, with a population of 80,500 (2019). It is known for being the site of Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport, the busiest airport in Italy and the ninth-busiest in Europe, which serves Rome and much of central Italy.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name literally means &quot;little river&quot;. The town of &quot;Fiumicino&quot; should not be confused with like-named Fiumicino, a small river near Rimini.

===Recent history===
The destroyer &quot;Velos&quot;, in May 1973, (with a crew of 270 men in total) commanded by one of the pioneers of the movement, Admiral Nikos Pappas at the time, left the formation of vessels participating in a NATO exercise off the coast of Sardinia and rushed at the port of the city where seven officers (including the captain) and twenty-five petty officers requested political asylum from the Italian authorities, which, after many days of suffering, was granted. This went down in Greek history as the Navy Movement against the Regime of the Colonels.

Fiumicino became a &quot;comune&quot; in 1992; previously it was part of the municipality of Rome, being almost totally included in the former Municipio XIV.

On 24 August 2013, a small mud volcano popped up at the centre of the via Coccia di Morto roundabout.

==Geography==
Located by the Tyrrhenian coast. Fiumicino borders the municipalities of Anguillara Sabazia, Cerveteri, Ladispoli and Rome. It is on the northern side of the mouth of the river Tiber, next to Ostia.

It includes the hamlets () of Aeroporto &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;, Ara Nova (or Aranova), Casale del Castellaccio, Castel Campanile, Focene, Fregene, Isola Sacra, Le Vignole, Maccarese, Palidoro, Parco Leonardo, Passo Oscuro (or Passoscuro), Porto, Testa di Lepre, Torre in Pietra, Tragliata and Tragliatella.

==Economy==
Fiumicino is home to the largest airport in Italy, the Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport, which includes the Fiumicino Aeroporto railway station.

In addition, Fiumicino has a large fishing center on the Tyrrhenian Sea coast and a sea resort.

==Education==
The Istituto di Istruzione Superiore Leonardo da Vinci is in Fiumicino.

==Transport==

Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, also known as &quot;Rome–Fiumicino&quot;, lies in the north-eastern suburb of the town. It is served by the A91 motorway from Rome and by the Roman Suburban Railway line FL1.

The municipality contains the railway stations of Fiumicino Aeroporto and Parco Leonardo, both on the line FL1. Airport station is also served by a non-stop train from/to Roma Termini named the Leonardo Express.

The other stations within the municipality, Maccarese–Fregene and Torre in Pietra–Palidoro, are on the Rome–Pisa line. The branch line from Parco Leonardo to the town&#x27;s centre, including the stations of Porto, Fiumicino and Fiumicino Porto Canale, was closed in 2000.

<text>Jesus on Mars is a 1979 science fiction novel by American writer Philip José Farmer, set on Mars and involving an alien civilization. It makes social commentary on a just society and on religious belief.

==Plot summary==
An unmanned scientific probe sent to Mars discovers an alien artifact. A follow-up robotic explorer lands and verifies that an enormous alien ship is partially buried on Mars. So a crewed expedition is sent to explore this apparently abandoned alien ship. The expedition members are captured and taken underground to the habitat occupied by a combined society of humans living harmoniously with the alien Krsh.

The expedition learns that, in previous millennia, the technologically advanced Krsh were won over to the religion of the humans. This society practices Judaism but accepts Jesus as their Messiah. Included in their Bible is the &quot;Book of Matthias&quot; which is the testament written by Judas Iscariot. However, unlike mainstream Christianity, this society views Jesus as a man and not as God (see Nicene Creed).

Originally, the Krsh had arrived at Earth on an exploratory mission. To study humans, the Krsh had offered to bring injured humans to their spaceship for medical treatment. Then, the ship was attacked by another alien species which is especially hostile and xenophobic. Even though the attack was repelled and the ship of the xenophobic aliens was destroyed, the Krsh&#x27;s own ship was damaged. So they landed on Mars to hide from more potential hostility which never arrived. During the years of camouflage, the Krsh and humans crew joined together into a unified society.

Halfway through the novel, we learn that Jesus himself miraculously arrived among these people almost two thousand years earlier and had been living with them ever since. The proximity of Jesus is overwhelming and convincing both in terms of concrete, scientifically verifiable miracles as well as a strong visceral presence. This proximity convinces even the scientifically advanced Krsh. Also, three of the four crew members accept this Jesus and convert to this hybrid form of Judaism and Christianity. The fourth crew member, an atheist and the only female crew member, commits suicide. She is subsequently resurrected using advanced technology but not before she suffers brain damage that erases much of her personality.

Towards the end of the novel, Jesus leads a flotilla of spaceships back to Earth in a reenactment of the Second Coming. Although desiring peaceful interaction and offering immortality and boundless manna, they are prepared for hostile action. As can be expected, Jesus is accused of being the Antichrist.

Such doubts afflict Richard Orme who is the astronaut leading the crewed expedition from Earth. In the penultimate chapter, Orme wavers on his conversion and submission to this Martian Jesus. He then prepares to assassinate the Jesus but throws himself upon a grenade from another assassin so as to save Jesus. In the final chapter, he awakens naked and disoriented to discover that he has been resurrected by Jesus while the world media looked on. Then, Orme reaffirms his commitment and the novel ends abruptly with a sense of the years of impending struggle against the forces of evil.

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Jesus on Mars&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #1. Costikyan commented that &quot;&quot;Jesus on Mars&quot; would be brilliant if it were written by a novice; but from Farmer, one expects better things.&quot;

<text>In music, especially folk and popular music, a matrix is an element of variations which does not change. The term was derived from use in musical writings and from Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;The Act of Creation&quot;, who defines creativity as the bisociation of two sets of ideas or matrices. Musical matrices may be combined in any number, usually more than two, and may be — and must be for analysis — broken down into smaller ones. They are not necessarily intended by the composer or perceived by the listener, and they may be purposefully ambiguous.

The simplest examples given by van der Merwe are fixed notes, definite intervals, and regular beats, while the most complex given are the Baroque fugue, Classical tonality, and Romantic chromaticism. The following examples are some matrices which are part of &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;:
*major mode
*6/8 time
*four-bar phrasing
*regular beat
*rhyming tune structure
*ending both halves of the tune with the same figure
*melodic climax
*perfect cadence
*three primary triads implied
Co-ordinated matrices may possess &quot;&quot;bound-upness&quot; or &quot;at-oddness&quot;&quot;, depending on the degree to which they are connected to each other or go their separate ways, respectively, and are more or less easy to reconcile. The matrices of the larger matrix known as sonata rondo form are more bound up than the matrices of rondo form, while African and Indian music feature more rhythmic at-oddness than European music&#x27;s coinciding beats, and European harmony features more at-oddness (between the melody and bass) than the preceding organum. At-oddness is a matter of degree, and almost all at odd matrices are partially bound up.

== Mathematical matrices in music ==

Mathematical matrices are used in the visualization of all permutations or forms of a tone row or set in music written using the twelve tone technique or serialism (set-complex).

<text>Joseph Farwell Glidden (January 18, 1813 – October 9, 1906) was an American businessman and farmer. He was the inventor of the modern barbed wire. In 1898, he donated land for the Northern Illinois State Normal School in DeKalb, Illinois, which was renamed as Northern Illinois University in 1957.

== Early life ==
Glidden was born in Charlestown, New Hampshire, of English descent. His family later moved to Clarendon, New York. Glidden was a teacher there for about 8 years, during which years he married Clarissa Foster in 1837. In 1843, he moved to Illinois with his wife and children, first to Ogle County and then to DeKalb where they had purchased a farm. His wife died in 1846, in childbirth of their daughter in Ogle County, Illinois. Their three children, including the infant daughter Clara (Clarissa) died in an epidemic in 1847. Their two sons died after the move. Glidden married Lucinda Warne in 1851, with whom he had one daughter, Elva Frances.

==Invention and patent for barbed wire ==

Glidden began work on ways to make a useful barbed wire to fence cattle in 1873. He made his best design of barbed wire by using a coffee mill to create the barbs. Glidden placed the barbs along a wire and then twisted another wire around it to keep the barbs in place, in a design that he called &quot;The Winner&quot;, being his best design. He received the patent for that barbed wire design on November 24, 1874, when he was 61 years old. He and local hardware dealer Isaac L. Ellwood began manufacturing and selling the barbed wire with his patent, as the Barb Fence Company in DeKalb, Illinois. In 1876, Glidden exited the manufacturing aspect, though retaining royalties, by selling his half of the manufacturing business to Washburn and Moen, who had a wire manufacturing plant in Worcester, Massachusetts and from whom Glidden and Ellwood had been purchasing steel wire. Ellwood stayed in DeKalb and renamed the company I. L. Ellwood &amp; Company of DeKalb. That company evolved into American Steel and Wire, and eventually was bought by U. S. Steel Manufacturing Company.

Glidden was embroiled in a legal battle initiated by fellow DeKalb resident Jacob Haish over whether the design for holding the barbs in place with an extra strand of wire was novel, an improved design. An earlier patent for barbed wire had been issued to a man in Ohio, among other patents related to barbed wire. Glidden eventually won at the US Supreme Court in an 1892 case, his patent protection expired the same year. The legal fees were estimated to have cost Glidden $100,000.
This invention made him extremely rich. It was estimated that Glidden earned $1,000,000 in royalties until his patent expired in 1892. Companies manufacturing the barbed wire under his license ranged from New York state to Kansas by 1884. By the time of his death in 1906, he was one of the richest men in America. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Collection, 1840–1895, MSS 791, LXIII, 130, Baker Library, Harvard, recorded his assets at one million dollars. This included the Glidden House Hotel; the &quot;DeKalb Chronicle&quot;; 3,000 acres (12 km2) of farmland in Illinois; 35,000 acres (1,360 km2) in Texas; and the Glidden Felt Pad Industry.

===Local political activity and other businesses===
From 1852 to 1854, he served as sheriff of DeKalb County. In 1851, 1861, 1862, 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872, and 1876 he served on the county&#x27;s board of supervisors. In 1867, he served on the executive committee of DeKalb County Agriculture and Mechanical Society&#x27;s Seventh Annual Fall Fair, held September 25–28. In 1876, he was the Democratic nominee for Illinois State Senator. From 1861 to 1874, he served as a member of the board of school directors, and for 20 years paid the largest school tax of any citizen of the county. He was also one of the largest contributors to the erection of one of the churches. He was also vice-president of the DeKalb National Bank, director of the North Western Railroad, and owner of the DeKalb Rolling Mill.

===Demonstration of use in Texas changes ranching===
To demonstrate the effectiveness of barbed wire, Glidden and his sales agent for the State of Texas, Marques Fortner, in 1881 developed the &quot;Frying Pan Ranch&quot; in Bushland in Potter County near Amarillo, Texas. The wire was brought in by wagon from the railhead at Dodge City, Kansas, and the timbers were cut from Palo Duro Canyon and along the Canadian River Valley. A herd of 12,000 head of cattle was branded with the &quot;Panhandle Brand&quot;, which the cowboys called &quot; frying pan&quot;. The ranch proved the success of the wire and changed ranching.

Henry B. Sanborn, a sales representative for Glidden&#x27;s company, owned a ranch in Grayson County north of Dallas and wished to advertise barbed wire there. In 1881, Sanborn purchased ninety-five sections of land in southwestern Potter County from near the Canadian River extending into Randall County south of Amarillo. Included in the purchase was Tecovas Spring, once a watering site and a trading post for Indians and Comancheros. John Summerfield, a surveyor from Sherman, Texas, reported a constant flow of freshwater from the spring. Sanborn chose this site for his ranch headquarters and enclosed 120 miles of land in barbed wire for $39,000 ($ in dollars). Warren W. Wetzel, also of Sherman, used cedar posts brought from both the Palo Duro Canyon and the breaks of the Sierrita de la Cruz in the northwestern portion of the ranch to hold up the wire.

Besides ranchers, railroads were large purchasers of barbed wire, so that cattle did not stray onto their tracks. 

The Frying Pan Ranch soon had 15,000 head of cattle, and 125,000 more acres were added. Later the ranch was divided. In 1898, Glidden deeded Frying Pan Ranch to his son-in-law William Henry Bush. Between 1908 and 1920, William Henry Bush and his second wife Ruth Bush built a larger ranch house near Tecovas Spring, which later became the residence of Stanley Marsh 3 and his wife, Wendy. Gwendolyn &quot;Wendy&quot; Bush O&#x27;Brien was the daughter of Emeline Bush and her husband Frank O&#x27;Brien; Emeline was a daughter of William Henry and Ruth Bush. Stanley Marsh called the estate &quot;Toad Hall&quot;.

==Land for the Northern Illinois State Normal School ==
Glidden, a former teacher, gave 63 acres (255,000 m2) of his homestead as a site for the Northern Illinois State Normal School. The school opened on September 12, 1898, with 139 students and 16 members of the faculty. The school&#x27;s name was changed to Northern Illinois University in 1957.

The town of Glidden, Iowa, is named in his honor.

==Personal life==
He and his wife Lucinda had one daughter, Elva Frances, in 1851. She married William Henry Bush in DeKalb on February 1, 1877. His wife Lucinda died on October 28, 1895. Elva died in 1906 not long before her father died, and is buried in the Glidden family plot in a cemetery in DeKalb.

In 1898, Glidden deeded his Frying Pan ranch in Texas to his son-in-law, W. H. Bush. Bush married again in 1908, after being widowed, to Ruth Russell Gentry. He is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;barbed wire salesman&quot; in &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; is either based on Joseph F. Glidden or John Warne Gates who was a pioneer promoter of barbed wire. He is played by Richard Dysart.

<doc id="752409" wikidata="Q5030774" url="?curid=752409" title="Canadian federal election results in Eastern Montreal">
<text>Canadian federal elections have provided the following results in Eastern Montreal.
==Regional profile==
The eastern end of the Island of Montreal was the birthplace of the sovereigntist movement, and remained a sovereigntist stronghold for four decades. During this time, whenever the Parti Québécois won provincially, the entire eastern half of the island was coated light blue. Federally, it was the Bloc Québécois&#x27;s power base from 1993 to 2011, partly due to its leftist bent. With the exception of ethnic areas that protrude from Northern Montreal into the East Island&#x27;s Honoré-Mercier riding, where Liberal support is strong, the area is relatively homogeneously Francophone and lower-income, a recipe for Bloc dominance. Prior to the rise of the Bloc, the region voted solidly Liberal for decades before being swept up in the Brian Mulroney tide, electing Quebec nationalists under the Progressive Conservative banner. The Conservative Party of Canada has never approached this level of support, and eastern Montreal is currently the weakest region in Canada for the Tories. In 2011, the federalist NDP swept every seat in this region amid the surge of popular support in the province and the concurrent Bloc meltdown, in all but one case by well over 6,000 votes. The NDP surge even cost longtime Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe his seat in Laurier-Sainte-Marie.

The NDP largely held its gains in 2015, losing Honoré-Mercier to the Liberals and La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île—long reckoned as the most strongly sovereigntist riding in Quebec—to the Bloc. However, Duceppe came up well short in his bid to retake his old riding. In 2019, however, the NDP was cut down to just one riding in eastern Montreal, with the Bloc holding onto La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île and the Liberals taking the other three.

<text>Werken is a small rural village in the centre of the Belgian province of West Flanders with around a thousand inhabitants. It is a district of Kortemark.

==Origins of the name==
The first mentions (Weretha) were found in texts from the Abbey of Sint-Bertinus in Sint-Omaars, dating from 830. The Old Dutch word &quot;Weretha&quot; dates from the time that the village of Werken was still on the sea-front, with a meaning equating to that of the English word &#x27;haven&#x27; (the literal meaning would be &quot;ashore on the water&quot;). In modern Dutch &quot;werken&quot; (uncapitalised) is coincidentally the verb &#x27;to work&#x27;.

==History==
For a long time Werken was closely associated with the sea, in the low-lying area that is now called the Handzamevaart Valley - gradually reclaimed for around the year 1000 through the erection of dikes. Handzamevaart was under the influence of the tide until the twelfth century. The Mortagne family is recorded to have been in the area since the eleventh century, eventually becoming the lords of Werken - inhabiting a motte castle known as Hogen Andjoen (the &#x27;high onion&#x27;).

The Order of St.Clare founded a convent in 1286, and in 1295 the Cistercians of Hemelsdale Abbey moved their nuns to Werken (while the Clares relocated to Petegem). In 1578 the convent was destroyed during religious disputes, and the sisters returned to Bruges .

At the end of the seventeenth century, Werken also cam under attack from French forces, the situation normalising in 1713. At Barisdam (a little to the east of the Werken-Zarren line) ships were able to moor, which caused some activity. In the 19th century there was also a shipping route to the market of Diksmuide.

From 1851 the Sisters of St.Vincent de Paul were based in Werken to provide education. In the second half of the nineteenth century there was also brewery and a gin distillery.

During the close of the First World War there was fighting around Werken and on October 16, 1918 the village was liberated. There were many demolitions, but the village was not completely ruined.

Until 1925 there was still shipping on the Handzamevaart. In 1943, the church was destroyed during the Second World War.

Werken merged with Zarren in the beginning of 1971 to form the municipality of Zarren-Werken, but this was abolished in early 1977 and added to the Kortemark merged municipality in the form of two sub-municipalities.

==Geography==
The surface area of Werken is approximately 9.79 km², the majority of which is arable land.

The northern part of the borough is sloping (Sandy Flanders) with a highest point of 19 metres near Edewalle, and a lowest point of approximately 4 metres in the Handzamevaart valley. The surrounding bowl is approximately 7 metres high. Various streams, including the Calvebeek, flow to the southwest and waters into the Handzamevaart.

The Handzamevaart is a medium-sized stream that crosses Zarrenstraat and Steenstraat and eventually flows into the IJzer in Diksmuide. This stream runs through Werken by &#x27;de Broeken&#x27;, a flood plain now used for agricultural purposes. Between the Oude Gracht (Zarren) and the Handzamevaart there is a channel with a pumping station which systematically pumps excess water in to the Handzamevaart.

== Archaeological and historical sites==
* The &quot;Hogen Andjoen&quot; (the &quot;high onion&quot;) is a motte that dates from somewhere between the eighth and the ninth century.
* Saint Martinus Kerk, one of the first churches in the area — is about 20 metres from the motte. The original church made of wood dated from the eighth century, but has been rebuilt on several occasions in history. The present building was rebuilt after the first world war of 1918 in its original Roman style.

<doc id="752415" wikidata="Q2113078" url="?curid=752415" title="Cleveland Stadium">
<text>Cleveland Stadium, commonly known as Municipal Stadium, Lakefront Stadium or Cleveland Municipal Stadium, was a multi-purpose stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. It was one of the early multi-purpose stadiums, built to accommodate both baseball and football. The stadium opened in 1931 and is best known as the long-time home of the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB), from 1932 to 1993 (including 1932–1946 when games were split between League Park and Cleveland Stadium), and the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL), from 1946 to 1995, in addition to hosting other teams, other sports, and concerts. The stadium hosted three AAFC Championship Games, six NFL Championship Games, served as one of the host venues of the 1948 and 1954 World Series to go along with being a four-time host of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the site of the original Dawg Pound, Red Right 88, and The Drive.

Through most of its tenure as a baseball facility, the stadium was the largest in Major League Baseball by seating capacity, seating over 78,000 initially and over 74,000 in its final years. It was superseded only by the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1958 to 1961, while it was the temporary home of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and by Mile High Stadium in 1993, the temporary home of the expansion Colorado Rockies. For football, the stadium seated approximately 80,000 people, ranking as one of the larger seating capacities in the NFL.

Former Browns owner Art Modell took over control of the stadium from the city in the 1970s and while his organization made improvements to the facility, it continued to decline. The Indians played their final game at the stadium in October 1993 and moved to Jacobs Field the following season. Although plans were announced to renovate the stadium for use by the Browns, in 1995 Modell announced his intentions to move the team to Baltimore citing the state of Cleveland Stadium as a major factor. The Browns played their final game at the stadium in December 1995, after which they were renamed the Baltimore Ravens. As part of an agreement between Modell, the city of Cleveland, and the NFL, the Browns were officially deactivated for three seasons and the city was required to construct a new stadium on the Cleveland Stadium site. Cleveland Stadium was demolished in 1996 to make way for Cleveland Browns Stadium, which opened in 1999. Much of the debris from the demolition was placed in Lake Erie to create an artificial reef.

==History==
The impetus for Cleveland Stadium came from city manager William R. Hopkins, Cleveland Indians&#x27; president Ernest Barnard, real estate magnate and future Indians&#x27; president Alva Bradley, and the Van Sweringen brothers, who thought that the attraction of a stadium would benefit area commerce in general and their own commercial interests in downtown Cleveland in particular. However, some have incorrectly stated that it was built in a failed bid to attract the 1932 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Los Angeles in 1923, long before ground was broken on the stadium. Another common misconception is that Cleveland Stadium was a Works Progress Administration project; in fact, the WPA was not created until 1935, four years after the stadium was built.

In November 1928, Cleveland voters passed by 112,448 to 76,975, a 59% passage rate, with 55% needed to pass, &quot;a US$2.5 million levy for a fireproof stadium on the Lakefront.&quot; Actual construction costs overran that amount by $500,000.

==Construction==

Built during the administrations of city managers William R. Hopkins and Daniel E. Morgan, it was designed by the architectural firms of Walker and Weeks and by Osborn Engineering Company. It featured an early use of structural aluminum.
The stadium was dedicated on July 1, 1931. On July 3, 1931, it hosted a boxing match for the National Boxing Association World Heavyweight Championship between Max Schmeling and Young Stribling, with 37,000 fans in attendance. Schmeling retained his title by a technical knockout victory in the 15th round.

The Donald Gray Gardens were installed on the stadium&#x27;s north side in 1936 as part of the Great Lakes Exposition. They remained until construction started on Cleveland Browns Stadium in 1997.

==Tenants==

===Indians===
The stadium was built for football as well as for the Cleveland Indians, who played their first game there on July 31, 1932, losing to the Philadelphia Athletics&#x27; great pitcher Lefty Grove 1–0 while attracting a then-major-league-record crowd of 80,184. The Indians played all of their games at the stadium from the middle of the 1932 season through 1933. However, the players and fans complained about the huge outfield, which reduced the number of home runs. Moreover, as the Great Depression worsened, attendance plummeted. The Indians returned to their smaller previous home, League Park, which was owned by the team, for all of the 1934 and 1935 seasons.

The Indians used the stadium to host the 1935 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and returned to the stadium in 1936 to host the New York Yankees on August 2 as part of the Great Lakes Exposition, drawing a crowd of 65,342. In 1937, the Indians began playing Sunday and holiday games at Cleveland Stadium during the summer, adding selected important games there in 1938. League Park lacked field lighting, so the emergence of night baseball in the 1930s led to the addition of night games to the schedule after lights were installed at the stadium in 1939. In 1940 and from 1942 on, the Indians played the majority of their home slate at the stadium, abandoning League Park entirely after the 1946 season. They remained at Cleveland Stadium until the end of the 1993 season, after which they moved to Jacobs Field.

The stadium foreshadowed problems that would emerge 40 years later when cookie-cutter stadiums were in vogue. Due to the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of baseball and football fields, the baseball sight lines generally left much to be desired. Many of the seats in the upper deck were too far from the field to be of any use during the regular season. The original baseball playing field was so large that an inner fence was constructed in 1947 to cut down the size of the spacious outfield. Even after the fence was installed, the distance markers on the bleacher walls remained visible for many years: from home plate to the bleachers in straightaway center field, to either corner of the bleachers, and to the far corners of the main stands in left-center and right-center. No player ever hit a home run into the center field bleachers. 
According to his autobiography, &quot;Veeck – As in Wreck&quot;, Indians owner Bill Veeck would move the fence in or out, varying by as much as , depending on how it would favor the Indians, a practice that ended when the American League specifically legislated against moving fences during the course of a given season. But over the years, various ownerships tinkered with the position of the fence from time to time.

Like some other facilities built before warning tracks became standard, the stadium had an earthen berm in front of the center field wall. After the inner fence was installed, the berm was still visible during football season.

Jim Palmer was convinced that the pitcher&#x27;s mound at the stadium was taller than most. &quot;The mound was, despite whatever the rules claim, just a little lower than Mount Kilimanjaro.&quot;

The facility, located just south of Lake Erie, was known for the biting cold winds that would blow into the stadium in winter, as well as during much of the spring and fall. Because of its proximity to the lake during hot summer nights, its lights attracted swarms of midges and mayflies. Game 2 of the 2007 American League Division Series at Jacobs Field on October 5, 2007, brought back memories of the old stadium, when swarms of midges (misidentified by the television announcers as mayflies) infested the field, particularly the pitcher&#x27;s mound.

The Indians set three Major League attendance records during the 1948 season, when they won the American League pennant and World Series behind pitcher Bob Feller and shortstop/player-manager Lou Boudreau. That season, Cleveland had the highest single season attendance, 2,620,627, which was not eclipsed until 1962 by the Los Angeles Dodgers, largest regular season night game attendance of 72,434 for the first major league start of Satchel Paige, and biggest World Series game attendance of 86,288 for game 5 on October 10, 1948. However, during the Indians&#x27; lean years from the 1960s through the 1990s, they rarely attracted more than 30,000 people, and even crowds of 40,000 looked sparse in the cavernous environment. After the Indians were eliminated from the pennant race in 1949, as a black humor-themed stunt they held a mock funeral procession on the field and buried their 1948 pennant behind the center field fence. Due to the large size of the facility, the Indians began using a bullpen car in 1950.

In addition to the 1935 MLB All-Star Game, Cleveland Stadium also hosted three additional all-star games: 1954, 1963, and 1981. Cleveland Stadium and Yankee Stadium are the only venues to host four MLB all-star games. On May 15, 1981, Len Barker threw a perfect game at the stadium, the second in franchise history and eighth in modern Major League history. The final Indians home game at Cleveland Stadium was held October 3, 1993, a 4–0 loss to the Chicago White Sox in front of 72,390 fans. During the game, fans, led by comedian Bob Hope, who grew up an Indians fan and was once a part-owner, sang a version of his signature song &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot; with special lyrics for the occasion.

===Browns===

The Cleveland Browns, originally members of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), began playing at the facility in 1946, and played there through 1995. The stadium was the site of the AAFC Championship game in 1946, 1948 and 1949, all Browns wins. The Browns joined the NFL in 1950 and hosted the NFL Championship Game in 1950, 1952, 1954, 1964, and 1968, winning titles in 1950, 1954, and 1964.

The first Browns game at the stadium was also the first AAFC game, when the Browns hosted the Miami Seahawks on September 6, 1946. The Browns won the game 44–0 and drew 60,135 fans, what was then a record for a professional football crowd. During the 1980s, the center field bleachers at the east end of the stadium were home to many of the club&#x27;s most avid fans and became known as the Dawg Pound after the barks that fans made to disrupt opposing teams&#x27; offensive plays. The fans were copying Browns players Hanford Dixon and Frank Minnifield, who frequently appeared to bark to each other and to the opposition. Some of the fans even wore dog masks and threw dog biscuits at opposing players. The Dawg Pound was included in the design of Cleveland Browns Stadium (built on the same site as Cleveland Stadium), where the east end zone also has bleacher seating.

The stadium was also the site of two notable moments in Cleveland sports and Browns history. In a 1981 divisional playoff game on January 4, Browns quarterback Brian Sipe was intercepted in the end zone with less than a minute remaining in the game, resulting in a 14–12 loss to the Oakland Raiders. The game has since been referred to by the name of the pass play, Red Right 88. Six years later, during the 1987 AFC Championship game on January 11, John Elway led the Denver Broncos on what is referred to as The Drive, a 98-yard touchdown drive with 5:32 left that tied the game and sent it into overtime. The Broncos ultimately prevailed 23–20.

The final game in the stadium was held December 17, 1995, an emotional 26–10 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, the Browns&#x27; final game before the franchise was officially deactivated until 1999. At the end of that game, many fans cut and removed their seats.

===Football Indians and Rams===
Prior to the arrival of the Browns, the stadium was briefly the home field for two other NFL teams, the Cleveland Indians in 1931, and the Cleveland Rams from 1936 to 1937 and again from 1939 to 1941. The football Indians played two home games in their 1931 season, a 6–0 win over the Brooklyn Dodgers and a 14–0 loss to the Chicago Cardinals. The team drew a crowd of around only 2,000 spectators for the September 26th game against Brooklyn and 10,000 for the loss to the Cardinals on November 8.
The Rams were founded in 1936 as members of the second American Football League and joined the NFL in 1937. They played home games at the stadium their first two seasons, before moving to the smaller Shaw Stadium in 1938. The Rams returned to the stadium in 1939 and played home games there through the 1941 season before moving to League Park for the remainder of their time in Cleveland. The team returned to the stadium one last time to host the 1945 NFL Championship Game, a 15–14 win in what was the final Rams game in Cleveland before the team relocated to Los Angeles.

==Other events==

===College football===
The only Great Lakes Bowl was held there in 1947.

The stadium hosted the annual college football game between Notre Dame and Navy 11 times: in 1932, 1934, 1939, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1947, 1950, 1952, 1976 and 1978. The games were well attended, with an average attendance of 69,730 and a high of 84,090 fans for the 1947 game, which was won by Notre Dame 27–0.

Local college teams, including Western Reserve Red Cats, Case Tech Rough Riders, John Carroll Blue Streaks, and Baldwin Wallace Yellow Jackets often used the stadium for home games and local matchups, especially during the 1930s and 1940s when the city &quot;Big Four Conference&quot; was strong. Of the 60 all-time &quot;Big Four&quot; matchups, 22 were played at Cleveland Stadium, the most of any venue.

The Illinois Fighting Illini played the Penn State Nittany Lions there in 1959. The Ohio State Buckeyes played in the stadium four times, the first three as the home team during World War II. The first was in a 1942 win over Illinois before 68,656, the second a 1943 loss to Purdue, and the third a 1944 victory over Illinois. The final college football contest played there was on October 19, 1991, when the Northwestern Wildcats played a neutral site &quot;home&quot; game against the Buckeyes. While Northwestern received the home team&#x27;s share of the gate receipts, Buckeye fans made up the vast majority of the crowd.
===Concerts===
In addition to sporting events, the stadium hosted a number of other events including concerts. The first concert held at the stadium, featuring the Beatles, took place in 1966. From 1974 to 1980, the World Series of Rock concerts were held each summer featuring acts such as the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys and Aerosmith. The Rolling Stones&#x27; July 1, 1978 concert of 82,238 attendees was reportedly the first concert to gross over $1 million.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the stadium hosted concerts by the Jacksons, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Genesis, the Who and Paul McCartney, plus more concerts by Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones.

On September 2, 1995, the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was celebrated with an all-star concert which featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Jerry Lee Lewis and others.

===Religious events===
The stadium also hosted numerous religious services. Its most heavily attended event was the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s Seventh Eucharistic Congress, hosted by the Diocese of Cleveland in 1935, which attracted 75,000 to a midnight mass on September 24, 1935, and an estimated 125,000 to Eucharistic service the following day. One of the stadium&#x27;s last events was a Billy Graham crusade, held in 1994.

==Demise==

As the stadium aged and maintenance costs increased, the facility became an economic drain on the City of Cleveland, which owned and originally operated it. In 1973, then-Browns owner Art Modell signed a 25-year lease to operate Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Modell&#x27;s newly formed company, Stadium Corporation, assumed the expenses of operations from the city, freeing up tax revenue for other purposes. Also, Modell would pay an annual rent of $150,000 for the first five years and $200,000 afterward to the city. In exchange, Modell would receive all revenue generated by the stadium. Stadium Corp invested in improvements, including new electronic scoreboards and luxury suites. However, the stadium&#x27;s inadequacy was becoming apparent in any event; chunks of concrete were falling off and the pilings were starting to petrify.

Modell, mistakenly believing that his revenues were not endangered, refused to participate in the Gateway Project that built a new ballpark for the Indians and a new arena for the Cavaliers. Modell&#x27;s assumptions proved incorrect, and Stadium Corp.&#x27;s suite revenues declined sharply in the 1994 season without the approximately 81 games the Indians played in the facility each season. The following year, Modell announced plans to move the Browns to Baltimore after the 1995 season.

Modell&#x27;s move of the Browns breached the team&#x27;s lease, and the City of Cleveland sued. As part of the settlement, the city agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site. Modell agreed to leave the Browns&#x27; name, colors, and history in Cleveland, and the NFL agreed to have a resurrected Browns team by 1999, either by relocation or expansion. Demolition on Cleveland Stadium began in November 1996 and was completed in early 1997. of demolition debris was dumped into Lake Erie to create three artificial reefs for fishermen and divers, offshore of Cleveland and neighboring Lakewood. Construction on the new stadium began later in 1997 and it opened in August 1999 as Cleveland Browns Stadium.

==Popular culture==
Several scenes for the motion picture, &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;, were filmed during the game between the Browns and the visiting Minnesota Vikings on October 31, 1965. Much of the 1949 movie &quot;The Kid from Cleveland&quot;, in which Bob Feller, Lou Boudreau, Bill Veeck and Satchel Paige played themselves, was filmed there. Despite being set in the stadium, the 1989 motion picture &quot;Major League&quot; was not filmed in the stadium. While aerial distance shots of the stadium were used, Milwaukee County Stadium, whose grandstand interior looked similar to that of Municipal Stadium, was used for filming. Some scenes in the 1991 made-for-TV biopic &quot;Babe Ruth&quot;, starring Stephen Lang as Ruth and with a cameo by Pete Rose as Ty Cobb, were filmed there.

<text>The common buttonquail (Turnix sylvaticus), also called Kurrichane buttonquail, small buttonquail, or Andalusian hemipode is a buttonquail, one of a small family of birds which resemble but are not closely related to the true quails.

==Taxonomy==
The common buttonquail was formally described and illustrated in 1789 by the French botanist René Louiche Desfontaines under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao sylvaticus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;sylvaticus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;of the woods&quot;. It is now placed in the genus &quot;Turnix&quot; that was named in 1840 by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre.

Nine subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;T. s. sylvaticus&quot; (Desfontaines, 1789) – the southern Iberian Peninsula and northwestern Africa
* &quot;T. s. lepurana&quot; (Smith, A, 1836) – Africa south of the Sahara
* &quot;T. s. dussumier&quot; (Temminck, 1828) – eastern Iran to Myanmar
* &quot;T. s. davidi&quot; Delacour &amp; Jabouille, 1930 – central Thailand to southern China, northern Indochina and Taiwan
* &quot;T. s. bartelsorum&quot; Neumann, 1929 – Java and Bali, Indonesia
* &quot;T. s. whiteheadi&quot; Ogilvie-Grant, 1897 – Luzon, the northern Philippines
* &quot;T. s. celestinoi&quot; McGregor, 1907 – Bohol and Mindanao, the southern Philippines
* &quot;T. s. nigrorum&quot; duPont, 1976 – Negros island
* †&quot;T. s. suluensis&quot; Mearns, 1905 – the Sulu Archipelago

==Description==
The common buttonquail resembles the common quail. It has streaked sandy brown upperparts, buff underparts with black flank markings, and a plain face. In flight, a whitish wingbar contrasts with the grey wing. Sexes are similar, but immature birds are more spotted below. This tiny buttonquail is notoriously difficult to see. It is a small, long drab running bird, which avoids flying.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is resident from southern Spain and Africa through India and tropical Asia to Indonesia. It inhabits warm grasslands or scrub jungle and feeds on insects and seeds. This species avoids thick forest and hilly country, and lives by preference in cornfields and stretches of grassy plain though it may also be found in any type of low herbage and open scrub jungle.

==Behaviour==
It skulks and is flushed with difficulty, rising often close by one&#x27;s feet. When flushed it flies low over the ground and soon settles again, after which it is very difficult to put up a second time. The female calls with a deep &quot;hoom-hoom-hoom&quot; and the male replies &quot;kek-kek-kek&quot;.

===Breeding===

The female initiates courtship and builds the ground nest. The male incubates the normally four speckled greyish eggs, and tends the young, which can run as soon as they are hatched. The nesting season is June to September. The nest is a slight pad of grass placed in a natural hollow in the ground where it is usually tucked away amongst the stems of a tuft of grass. Very occasionally the grass is bent over it in a sort of canopy.

==Conservation==
Widespread throughout its large range, the common buttonquail is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the nominate subspecies, which is distributed in the Mediterranean region, is critically endangered. It disappeared from most of its range during the 20th century and is currently only present in Morocco after Spain officially declared the extinction of the species in 2018. In 2021, the IUCN also declared the common buttonquail extinct in Europe. This makes it the first bird species to have become extinct in Europe since the great auk in 1852.

<doc id="752429" wikidata="Q1581819" url="?curid=752429" title="Matrix (printing)">
<text>In the manufacture of metal type used in letterpress printing, a matrix (from the Latin meaning &quot;womb&quot; or &quot;a female breeding animal&quot;) is the mould used to cast a letter, known as a sort. Matrices for printing types were made of copper.

However, in printmaking the matrix is whatever is used, with ink, to hold the image that makes up the print, whether a plate in etching and engraving or a woodblock in woodcut.

==Description==
In letterpress or &quot;cold metal&quot; typesetting, used from the beginning of printing to the late nineteenth century, the matrix of one letter is inserted into the bottom of an adjustable-width hand mould, the mould is locked and molten type metal is poured into a straight-sided vertical cavity above the matrix. When the metal has cooled and solidified the mould is unlocked and the newly cast metal sort is removed. The matrix can then be reused to produce more copies of the sort. The sorts could then be cleaned up and sent to the printer. In a low-pressure hand mould matrices are long-lasting and so could be used many times.
In the hot metal typesetting systems of the later years of metal type printing, from the late nineteenth century onwards, new type is cast for each job under the control of a keyboard. The matrix or mats for a complete font are loaded into a matrix-case and inserted into a casting machine, which casts the required sorts (or, in a Linotype machine, a solid block for each line) for a page composition automatically, often from a paper reel.

===Manufacture===

The standard method to make a matrix was to drive a steel punch in the shape of the type to be made into soft copper. The matrix could then be cleaned up and cut down to the width of the letter to be cast: this is called &quot;justification&quot; and sets the width of the letter when cast. A matrix that has not yet been justified is called a &quot;strike&quot;. Adjustment of the matrix had to be done very carefully to ensure even flow of letters on the page.

Large typefaces, or wide designs such as emblems or medallions, were never very easily produced by punching since it was hard to drive large punches evenly. Early alternative methods used included printing from woodblocks, &#x27;dabbing&#x27;, where wood-blocks were punched into metal softened by heating, or carefully casting type or matrices in moulds made of softer materials than copper such as sand, clay, or punched lead. One solution to the problem in the early nineteenth century was William Caslon IV&#x27;s riveted &quot;Sanspareil&quot; matrices formed by cut-out from layered sheets. The problem was ultimately solved in the mid-nineteenth century by new technologies, electrotyping and pantograph engraving, the latter both for wood type and then for matrices.

From the nineteenth century additional technologies arrived to make matrices. The first was electrotyping from the 1840s, which forms a copper matrix around a pattern letter by electrodeposition of copper. The advantage of electrotyping was that the pattern letter did not have to be out of hard steel, so it could be cut in soft lead alloy much faster than a punch could. This allowed an explosion in the number of display typefaces available. It also allowed printers to form matrices for types for which they did not have matrices, or duplicate matrices when they had no punches, and accordingly was less honourably used to pirate typefaces from other foundries. The technology was most commonly used for larger and more esoteric display typefaces, with punched matrices preferred for body text types. An additional technology from the 1880s was the direct engraving of punches (or matrices, especially with larger fonts) using a pantograph cutting machine, controlled by replicating hand movements at a smaller size.

A duplexed matrix with two sites for casting letters was common on Linotype machines. By switching the position of the matrices in the machine it was easy to switch between casting two styles in the same line, the characters of which would have identical width. A common combination was regular and italic for printing body text, or regular and bold as with Metro, but Linotype also offered more unusual combinations, such as a serif text face duplexed with a bold sans-serif for emphasis.

<text>The Provinces of Prussia () were the main administrative divisions of Prussia from 1815 to 1946. Prussia&#x27;s province system was introduced in the Stein-Hardenberg Reforms in 1815, and were mostly organized from duchies and historical regions. Provinces were divided into several , sub-divided into &quot;Kreise&quot; (districts), and then into &quot;Gemeinden&quot; (townships) at the lowest level. Provinces constituted the highest level of administration in the Kingdom of Prussia and Free State of Prussia until 1933, when Nazi Germany established &quot;de facto&quot; direct rule over provincial politics, and were formally abolished in 1946 following World War II. The Prussian provinces became the basis for many federal states of Germany, and the states of Brandenburg, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein are direct successors of provinces.

==History==
Following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the various German states gained nominal sovereignty. However, the reunification process that culminated in the creation of the German Empire in 1871, produced a country that was constituted of several principalities and dominated by one of them, the Kingdom of Prussia after it had ultimately defeated its Austrian rival. Its territory covered some 60 percent of the territory that was to become the German Reich.

===German Confederation===

The German Confederation was established at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Kingdom of Prussia was a member until the dissolution in 1866 following the Austro-Prussian War.

The Prussian state was initially subdivided into ten provinces. The Prussian government appointed the heads of each province known as &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; (i.e. High Commissioner). The Oberpräsident represented the Prussian government in the province, and was busy with implementing and supervising central prerogatives of the Prussian government. The provinces of Prussia were further subdivided into government districts (Regierungsbezirke), subject to the High Commissioner. As to self-rule each province also had a provincial diet (&quot;Provinziallandtag&quot; in German), the members of which were elected in indirect election by county councillors and city councillors of the constituent rural counties and independent cities.

Western Provinces:
* Jülich-Cleves-Berg (Cologne), until 1822; regions: Cleves [until 1821], Cologne and Düsseldorf
* Lower Rhine (Koblenz), Grand Duchy, until 1822; regions: , Coblentz and Trier
* Saxony (Magdeburg); regions: , Magdeburg and 
* Westphalia (Münster); regions: Arnsberg, Minden and Münster
In 1822 the Rhine Province was created from the merger of the Lower Rhine and Jülich-Cleves-Berg provinces.
* Rhine Province (Koblenz); regions: Aachen, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Coblentz and Trier

Eastern Provinces (East Elbia):
* Brandenburg (Potsdam, Berlin [1827-1843]); regions: [until 1821], Frankfurt and 
* East Prussia (Königsberg in Prussia); regions: Gumbinnen and Königsberg
* Pomerania (Stettin); regions: Köslin, Stettin and Stralsund
* Posen (Posen), Grand Duchy of Posen until 1848; regions: Bromberg and Posen
* Silesia (Breslau); regions: Breslau, Liegnitz, Oppeln and [until 1820]
* West Prussia (Danzig); regions: Danzig and Marienwerder
In 1829 the Province of Prussia was created by the merger of East Prussia and West Prussia, lasting until 1878 when they were again separated. Congruent with the Kingdom of Prussia proper (i.e. former Ducal and Royal Prussia), its territory, like the province of Posen, was not part of the German Confederation.
* Province of Prussia (Königsberg in Prussia); regions: Danzig, Gumbinnen, Königsberg and Marienwerder

In 1850 the Province of Hohenzollern in Southern Germany, was created from the annexed principalities of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.
* Hohenzollern (Sigmaringen); region: Sigmaringen

In 1866, following the Austro-Prussian War, Prussia annexed several German States that had been allied with Austria and, together with previously occupied Danish territory, organized them into three new provinces:
* Hanover (Hanover; constituted from the Kingdom of Hanover); regions: , Hanover, , Lüneburg, and Stade 
* Hesse-Nassau (Kassel; constituted from the Free City of Frankfurt upon Main, Electorate of Hesse, Hesse-Homburg and the Duchy of Nassau); regions: Kassel and Wiesbaden
* Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel; constituted from the Duchy of Holstein and the Duchy of Schleswig); regions: Holstein (until 1868) and Schleswig; in 1876 Saxe-Lauenburg, a separate German state, was merged in.

===German Empire===

The outcome of the Austro-Prussian War put an end to the aspirations of a grand unified state consisting of all German-speaking states. Instead the North German Confederation was created under Prussian leadership. Following the Franco-Prussian War and the incorporation of the southern states of Bavaria, Baden and Württemberg into the confederation, the German Empire was proclaimed in 1871.

From 1875 the provinces were bodies combining regional home rule through representatives delegated from each rural and urban district ( and ), forming the provincial diet () with a 6-year term, which elected from its midst a head of this self-administration, the Landesdirektor (with a 6 to 12-year term), and a provincial government (, ) as well as part of the superordinated overall Prussian royal administration, supervising - on a provincial range - the self-governing municipalities and counties as well as each governorate (, mere supervising bodies of the Prussian government). For this purpose, the respective Prussian minister of interior affairs appointed a High Commissioner () to each province, who fulfilled his task with the help of a Prussian government-appointed provincial council ().

In 1881 the final province of the Kingdom of Prussia was established when Berlin was separated from Brandenburg.

* Berlin (On 1 April 1881 the city was separated from Brandenburg to become a city-province. Its lord mayor () carried out the duties of a Landesdirektor in the other provinces, while the city council doubled as the provincial committee. The Prussian government-appointed chief of police () served as the High Commissioner of Berlin.)

In 1918 following World War I the German Empire was dissolved and replaced by the Weimar Republic. The following were the existing Prussian provinces:

* Berlin 
* Brandenburg (Potsdam; from 1881 on without Berlin, but provincial offices remained in Berlin); regions: Frankfurt and 
* East Prussia (Königsberg in Prussia); regions: Allenstein (as of 1905), Gumbinnen and Königsberg
* Hanover (Hanover;); regions: , Hanover, , Lüneburg, and Stade 
* Hesse-Nassau (Kassel;); regions: Kassel and Wiesbaden
* Hohenzollern (Sigmaringen); region: Sigmaringen
* Pomerania (Stettin); regions: Köslin, Stettin and Stralsund
* Posen (Posen); regions: Bromberg and Posen
* Rhineland (Düsseldorf as to provincial self-rule, Koblenz as to High Commissioner offices); regions: , Cologne, Düsseldorf, Koblenz and Trier
* Saxony (Magdeburg); regions: , Magdeburg and 
* Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel;); regions: Holstein (until 1868) and Schleswig
* Silesia (Breslau); regions: Breslau, Liegnitz and Oppeln 
* Westphalia (Münster); regions: Arnsberg, Minden and Münster
* West Prussia (Danzig;); regions: Danzig and Marienwerder

===Weimar Republic===

After the fall of the German Empire the Kingdom of Prussia was reconstituted with a republican government as the Free State of Prussia. The Free State promoted the democratisation of the provinces, the provincial parliaments (Provinziallandtage) were elected in direct elections by the voters, unlike before when elected county councillors chose from their midst members for the provincial parliaments.

Prussia had to cede virtually all territory belonging to the provinces of Posen and West Prussia to the newly created state of Poland and the League of Nations mandate of the Free City of Danzig. Smaller areas had been ceded to Belgium (East Cantons, formerly in the Rhineland), Czechoslovakia (Hlučín Region, formerly in Silesia), Denmark (Northern Schleswig, formerly in Schleswig-Holstein), the League of Nations mandate of the Memel Territory (formerly in East Prussia), Poland (eastern Upper Silesia, formerly in Silesia), and the Saar Territory (formerly in the Rhineland).

Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, the Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich was enacted on 30 January 1934. This formally de-federalized the German Reich and created a centralized state. Prussia and its provinces formally continued to exist, but the state &quot;Landtag&quot; and provincial parliaments were abolished and governance was placed under the direct control of a &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich Governor). In addition, the Law on the Abolition of the Reichsrat of 14 February 1934 removed the right of the state and its provinces to participate in the Reich legislative process. They previously had controlled 26 of the 66 &quot;Reichsrat&quot; seats. 

The following is a summary of the changes in the Prussian provinces between 1919 and 1945:

* Berlin (in 1920 the city was considerably extended (Prussian Greater Berlin Act) at the expense of Brandenburg)
* Brandenburg (Berlin); regions: Frankfurt and 
* East Prussia (Königsberg in Prussia); regions: Allenstein, Gumbinnen, Königsberg and West Prussia (1922-1939)
* Hanover (Hanover; in 1921 Pyrmont, previously a district of the Free State of Waldeck-Pyrmont, was merged in); regions: , Hanover, , Lüneburg, and Stade 
* Hesse-Nassau (Kassel; in 1929 the Free State of Waldeck, previously a German state of its own, was merged in); regions: Kassel and Wiesbaden. In July 1944, the province was partitioned into two new provinces along the lines of its regions: the Province of Kurhessen (Kassel); region: Kassel; and the Province of Nassau (Wiesbaden); region: Wiesbaden.
* Hohenzollern (Sigmaringen); region: Sigmaringen
* Lower Silesia (Breslau; merged with the Province of Upper Silesia to form the unified Province of Silesia between 1938 and 1941); regions: Breslau and Liegnitz 
* Pomerania (Stettin); regions: Köslin, Stettin, Posen-West Prussia (as of 1938) and Stralsund (until 1932)
* Posen-West Prussia (Schneidemühl; created in 1922 from parts of the provinces Posen and West Prussia that had not been ceded to Poland, the province was dissolved in 1938 with its territory being mainly incorporated into Pomerania, and two exclaves into Brandenburg and Silesia.); region: 
* Rhineland (Düsseldorf as to provincial self-rule, Koblenz as to High Commissioner offices); regions: , Cologne, Düsseldorf, Koblenz and Trier
* Saxony (Magdeburg); regions: , Magdeburg and . In July 1944, the province was partitioned along the lines of its regions. Erfurt was ceded to Thuringia, while the bulk of the province was divided into the Province of Magdeburg (Magdeburg) and the Province of Halle-Merseburg (Merseburg) 
* Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel; in 1920 Northern Schleswig was ceded to Denmark); region: Schleswig
* Upper Silesia (Oppeln [1919-1938], Kattowitz [1941-1945]; merged with the Province of Lower Silesia to form the unified Province of Silesia between 1938 and 1941); region: Oppeln 
* Westphalia (Münster); regions: Arnsberg, Minden and Münster

Prussia did not survive the defeat and the division of Germany following the end of World War II in 1945 and was formally abolished in February 1947 by . Several of its provinces attained statehood or became a part of other post-war states in East Germany and West Germany.

<doc id="752445" wikidata="Q870897" url="?curid=752445" title="League Park">
<text>League Park was a baseball park located in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. It was situated at the northeast corner of Dunham Street (now known as East 66th Street) and Lexington Avenue in the Hough neighborhood. It was built in 1891 as a wood structure and rebuilt using concrete and steel in 1910. The park was home to a number of professional sports teams, most notably the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball. League Park was first home to the Cleveland Spiders of the National League from 1891 to 1899 and of the Cleveland Lake Shores of the Western League, the minor league predecessor to the Indians, in 1900. From 1914 to 1915, League Park also hosted the Cleveland Spiders of the minor league American Association. In the 1940s, the park was also the home field of the Cleveland Buckeyes of the Negro American League.

In addition to baseball, League Park was also used for American football, serving as the home field for several successive teams in the Ohio League and early National Football League (NFL) during the 1920s and 1930s, as well as for college football. Most notably, the Cleveland Rams of the NFL played at League Park in 1937 and for much of the early 1940s. Later in the 1940s, the Cleveland Browns used League Park as a practice field.

The Western Reserve Red Cats college football team from Western Reserve University played a majority of homes games at League Park from 1929 to 1941, and all home games after joining the Mid-American Conference from 1947 to 1949. Western Reserve played many of its major college football games at League Park, including against the Ohio State Buckeyes, Pittsburgh Panthers, West Virginia Mountaineers, and Cincinnati Bearcats. Western Reserve and Case Tech often showcased their annual Thanksgiving Day rivalry game against one another, as well as playing other Big Four Conference games against John Carroll and Baldwin-Wallace. The final football game played at League Park was a 30–0 victory by Western Reserve University over rival Case Tech on Nov 24, 1949.

Although Cleveland Stadium opened in 1932 and had a much larger seating capacity and better access by car, League Park continued to be used by the Indians through the 1946 season, mainly for weekday games. Weekend games, games expecting larger crowds, and night games were held at Cleveland Stadium. Most of the League Park structure was demolished in 1951, although some remnants still remain, including the original ticket office built in 1909.

After extensive renovation, the site was rededicated on August 23, 2014, as the Baseball Heritage Museum and Fannie Lewis Community Park at League Park.

==History==
League Park was built for the Cleveland Spiders, who were founded in 1887 and played first in the American Association before joining the National League in 1889. Team owner Frank Robison chose the site for the new park, at the corner of Lexington Avenue and Dunham Street, later renamed East 66th Street, in Cleveland&#x27;s Hough neighborhood, because it was along the streetcar line he owned. The park opened May 1, 1891, with 9,000 wooden seats, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. The first pitch was made by Cy Young, and the Spiders won 12–3.

During their tenure, the Spiders finished as high as 2nd place in the NL in 1892, 1895, and 1896, and won the 1895 Temple Cup, an early version of the modern National League Championship Series, in 1895. During the 1899 season, however, the Spiders had most of their best players stripped from the roster and sent to St. Louis by their owners, who had purchased the St. Louis Browns that year. Consequently, Cleveland finished 20–134, and the Spiders season was so poor they drew only 6,088 fans for their entire home season—an average of only 145 per game—and were forced to play 112 of their 154 games on the road as the other NL teams deemed it pointless to travel to Cleveland&#x27;s League Park, since their cut of the ticket revenue would not come close to covering their travel and hotel expenses.

The team was contracted by the National League after 1899, being replaced the next year by the Cleveland Lake Shores, then a minor league team in the American League. The American League declared itself a major league after the 1900 season and the Cleveland franchise, initially called the Blues, was a charter member for the 1901 season.

The park was rebuilt for the 1910 season as a concrete-and-steel stadium, one of two to open that year in the American League, the other being Comiskey Park. The new park seated over 18,000 people, more than double the seating capacity of its predecessor. It opened April 21, 1910, with a 5–0 loss to the Detroit Tigers in front of 18,832 fans in a game started by pitcher Cy Young.

During 1914 to 1915, the Toledo Mud Hens of the minor league American Association were temporarily moved to League Park, to discourage the Federal League from trying to place a franchise in Cleveland. During their two-year stay, they were initially known as the Bearcats, then the Spiders, reviving the old National League club&#x27;s name.

 The Indians hosted games four through seven of the 1920 World Series at League Park. The series, won by the Indians five games to two, was notable as the first championship in franchise history, as well as for game five, which featured the first grand slam in World Series history and the only unassisted triple play in postseason history.

In 1921, team owner &quot;Sunny&quot; Jim Dunn, who had purchased the team in 1916, renamed the park Dunn Field. When Dunn died in 1922, his wife inherited the ballpark and the team. When Dunn&#x27;s widow, by then known as Mrs. George Pross, sold the franchise in 1927 for $1 million to a group headed by Alva Bradley, the name reverted to the more prosaic &quot;League Park&quot; (there were a number of professional teams&#x27; parks generically called &quot;league park&quot; at the time).

From July 31, 1932, through the 1933 season, the Indians played at the new and far larger Cleveland Stadium. However, the players and fans complained about the huge outfield, which reduced the number of home runs. Moreover, as the Great Depression worsened, attendance at the stadium plummeted. After the 1933 season, the Indians exercised their escape clause in the lease at the stadium and returned to League Park for the 1934 season.

The Indians played all home games at League Park for the 1934 and 1935 seasons, and played one home game at Cleveland Stadium in 1936 as part of the Great Lakes Exposition. In 1937, the Indians began splitting their schedule between the two parks, playing Sunday and holiday games at the stadium during the summer and the remainder at League Park, adding selected important games to the stadium schedule in 1938. Lights were never installed at League Park, and thus no major league night games were played there. However, at least one professional night game was played on July 27, 1931, between the Homestead Grays and the House of David, who borrowed the portable lighting system used by the Kansas City Monarchs.

In 1940 and from 1942 on, the Indians played the majority of their home schedule at Cleveland Stadium, abandoning League Park entirely after the 1946 season. The final Indians game at League Park was played on Saturday, September 21, a 5–3 loss in 11 innings to the Detroit Tigers in front of 2,772 fans. League Park became the last stadium used in Major League Baseball never to install permanent lights.

The Indians continued to own League Park until March 1950 when they sold it to the city of Cleveland for $150,000. After the demise of the Cleveland Buckeyes of the Negro American League during the 1950 season, League Park was no longer used as a regular sports venue. Most of the structure was demolished in 1951 by the city to convert the facility for use by local amateur teams and recreation and to prevent any competition with Cleveland Stadium. The lower deck seating between first base and third base remained, as did the Indians&#x27; clubhouse under the third base stands. The Cleveland Browns began using League Park as a practice field in 1952, including the former clubhouse, until 1965. All of the remaining seating areas were removed in 1961 except for the area above the former clubhouse, which was finally torn down in 2002.

==Structure==

When it originally opened in 1891, it had 9,000 wooden seats. A single deck grandstand was behind homeplate, a covered pavilion was along the first base line, and bleachers were located at various other places in the park. The ballpark was configured to fit into the Cleveland street grid, which contorted the dimensions into a rather odd rectangular shape by modern standards. The fence in left field was , away in center, and down the right field foul line. Batters had to hit the ball over a fence to get a home run (by comparison, the Green Monster at Fenway Park is high).

It was essentially rebuilt prior to the 1910 season, with concrete and steel double-decker grandstands, expanding the seating capacity to 21,414. The design work was completed by Osborn Architects &amp; Engineers, a local architecture firm that would go on to design several iconic ballparks over the next three years, including Comiskey Park, the Polo Grounds, Tiger Stadium, and Fenway Park. The front edges of the upper and lower decks were vertically aligned, bringing the up-front rows in the upper deck closer to the action, but those in back could not see much of foul territory.

The fence was reconfigured, bringing the left field fence in 10 feet closer () and center field fence in 40 feet (); the right field fence remained at .

Batters still had to surmount a fence to hit home runs. The fence in left field was only five feet tall, but batters had to hit the ball down the line to hit a home run, and it was fully to the scoreboard in the deepest part of center field. The diamond, situated in the northwest corner of the block, was slightly tilted counterclockwise, making right field not quite as easy a target as Baker Bowl&#x27;s right field (which had a wall), for example.

==Modern League Park==

Currently the site is a public park. A small section of the exterior brick facade (along the first-base side) still stands, as well as the old ticket office behind what was the right field corner. The last remnant of the grandstand, crumbling and presumably unsafe, was taken down in 2002 as part of a renovation process to the decaying playground. Local schools&#x27; youth teams still compete on the ball field.

On February 7, 2011, the Cleveland City Council approved a plan to restore the ticket house and remaining bleacher wall, as well as build a new diamond on the site of the old one (and with the same slightly counterclockwise tilt from the compass points). On October 27, 2012, city leaders including Mayor Frank G. Jackson and Councilman TJ Dow took part in the groundbreaking of the League Park restoration. The project included a museum, a restoration of the ball field, and a community park featuring pavilions and walking trails. The community park was dedicated in September 2013 as the Fannie M. Lewis Community Park at League Park. Lewis was a city councilwoman who encouraged League Park&#x27;s restoration.
Restoration was completed in 2014, and League Park reopened August 23 of that year. As part of the renovation, the Baseball Heritage Museum, housing artifacts from baseball history as well as many specifically from the history of League Park, was relocated from downtown Cleveland to the restored ticket house.

<text>The Church and Convent of Santo Domingo de Guzmán () in the city of Oaxaca de Juárez (Mexico) is an example of New Spanish Baroque architecture. The first construction projects for the building date back to 1551, when the Antequera de Oaxaca&#x27;s City Council ceded a total of twenty-four lots to the Dominican Order for the construction of a convent in the city. However, it was not until 1608 that the conventual complex of Santo Domingo was inaugurated, still unfinished.

Throughout its history, the Convent of Santo Domingo has been the scene of several important events in the history of Mexico: it was converted into a military warehouse, a stable, closed to Catholic worship in times of Jacobin secularism of the governments emanating from the Reform War, and then returned again to the Church by agreement of Porfirio Díaz. In 1979 it received the visit of the Catholic pontiff John Paul II, and was later declared —along with the entire Historic Center of Oaxaca— a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==History==
The first Dominicans arrived in Oaxaca at the end of 1528. More or less at the same time, the site of the indigenous town of Huaxyacac was erected in Villa de Antequera, by decree of King Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Later, in 1551, the town council granted the Dominicans some land located in the vicinity of the Cerro del Fortín hill for the purpose of building a convent. Although the original agreement committed the Dominican order to complete the works within a period of no more than twenty years, in 1572 the construction had not advanced too much. After some negotiations, the City Council extended the term for thirty more years, in exchange for the Dominicans supporting the financing of the drinking water supply works for the city. In the following thirty years, the construction of the building continued with its ups and downs, due to the fact that the Order did not have sufficient financial resources.

Two earthquakes at the beginning of the 17th century (the first, in 1603, and the second, in 1604) destroyed the Convent of San Pablo of Oaxaca, a fact that motivated the acceleration of the works of Santo Domingo. Four years later, the convent complex was formally inaugurated, and in 1623 the establishment was elevated to the category of university, where philosophy and theology courses were taught. The final works of the temple were concluded in 1666, when the decoration of the same was finalized. The last modification to the building occurred in 1724, the year in which the construction of the Chapel del Rosario began.

As of 1812, the Church of Santo Domingo and its annexed convent were occupied by the hosts of the different armies of the factions that disputed the control of the country. In this way, it was occupied by the royalist Army and the Insurgent Army during the Mexican War of Independence; and then by centralists and federalists throughout the nineteenth century until the arrival of Benito Juárez as president of Mexico.

In 1859, with the application of the Iglesias Law, the convent and the church of Santo Domingo were destined for the use of the Mexican Army. Seven years later, in 1866, Catholicism was suspended by the federal government, until in 1902 it was returned to the Church by President Porfirio Díaz.

==Description==
The front of the church is of three bodies and topped, in which Saint Dominic and Saint Hippolitus emerge holding a temple on which the Holy Spirit descends. The two bell towers have arched openings and four columns attached to each side, with fluted shafts and crowned with a pinnacle. Its domes are covered with azulejos and display small cups with lanterns.

Santo Domingo is an architectural complex that includes the temple itself, which currently continues to provide religious services for the Catholic community of the city of Oaxaca, and the annexed convent that is the headquarters of the Regional Museum of Oaxaca. The Convent of Santo Domingo currently houses an important museum collection made up of historical objects from the state of Oaxaca. One of the most important collections is that of the artistic objects discovered by Alfonso Caso in Tomb 7 of Monte Albán, belonging to the Mixtec culture. Another part of the convent currently houses the Oaxaca Ethnobotanical Garden, made up of plant species native to the state.

To access both the convent and the temple, it is necessary to cross a small square. This square is used as a stage for some popular festivals and other entertainment. Plaza de Santo Domingo is located half a kilometer from the main square of the city, with which it is connected through the Macedonio Alcalá Tourist Corridor, which is a cobblestone street that is very popular among tourists who visit Oaxaca de Juárez. As an anecdote, it is that when the sun is setting, the whole church is illuminated, and you can really appreciate all the architecture.

==Museum==
The rooms that formerly constituted the convent now house the Cultural Centre of Oaxaca, which was founded with the help of Oaxacan-born artist Francisco Toledo. This museum includes an important collection of pre-Columban artefacts, among them the contents of Tomb 7 from the nearby Zapotec site of Monte Albán. The former monastery garden is now an ethnobotanical garden, containing a large collection of plants native to the region.

The entrance to both church and museum is across a wide plaza that acts as a center for local fiestas and other entertainments. It is located about half a kilometre north of the central squares of the city, the Zócalo and the Alameda, and the connecting street is pedestrianised, so it is a popular place for both tourists and local residents to stroll.

<doc id="752454" wikidata="Q343525" url="?curid=752454" title="Catfish Collins">
<text>Phelps &quot;Catfish&quot; Collins (October 17, 1943 – August 6, 2010) was an American musician. A lead guitarist and rhythm guitarist, he is known mostly for his work in the P-Funk collective. Although frequently overshadowed by his younger brother, Bootsy Collins, Catfish played on many important and influential records by James Brown, Parliament, Funkadelic, and Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band.

==Early life==
Phelps Collins was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was the elder brother of William &quot;Bootsy&quot; Collins, whom he encouraged musically from a young age. It was Bootsy who nicknamed Phelps &quot;Catfish&quot; because Bootsy thought he looked like a fish.

==Career==
In 1968, the Collins brothers, along with Kash Waddy and Philippé Wynne, formed a group called The Pacemakers. Later the Pacemakers were hired by James Brown to accompany his vocals, at this they became known as The J.B.&#x27;s. Some of Brown&#x27;s previous band members had walked out because of money disputes.

During their tenure in the J.B.&#x27;s, they recorded such classics as &quot;Super Bad&quot;, &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine&quot;, &quot;Soul Power&quot; and &quot;Give It Up or Turnit a Loose&quot;. By 1971, Collins and the rest of the J.B.&#x27;s had quit James Brown.

The Collins brothers and Kash Waddy formed House Guests and shortly after joined Funkadelic and contributed to the Funkadelic album &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot;. On Catfish&#x27;s early work with James Brown and Funkadelic, Catfish played a Vox Ultrasonic guitar with built-in effects. Some of his most famous playing can be heard on the Parliament hit single &quot;Flash Light&quot;. Four years later, Collins joined Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band, which included Waddy, Joel &quot;Razor Sharp&quot; Johnson (keyboards), Gary &quot;Muddbone&quot; Cooper (vocals) and Robert &quot;P-Nut&quot; Johnson (vocals), along with The Horny Horns.

Collins played on albums by Freekbass and H-Bomb. In 1990, he performed on Deee-Lite&#x27;s biggest hit &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot;. In 2007, he contributed guitar work to the &quot;Superbad&quot; movie soundtrack.

==Personal life==
He died on August 6, 2010, in Cincinnati after a long battle with cancer. He was survived by two children.

Catfish Nation Celebration, a memorial concert, was held outside Cincinnati in Covington, Kentucky, at the Madison Theater and was attended by a number of musicians as well as hundreds of concertgoers.

<text>Canadian federal elections have provided the following results in Western Montreal.

==Regional profile==
Montreal boasts some of the most highly polarized political geography in Canada. While the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois dominated the mostly francophone East End for 20 years, the largely anglophone and Jewish western portions of the city have been a Liberal and federalist fortress for over six decades, being to the Liberals what rural Alberta is to the Conservatives. The region is home to some of the safest Liberal ridings in the nation (e.g. Mount Royal and Saint-Laurent—Cartierville). Even in the surge of support for Brian Mulroney in Quebec in 1984 and 1988, the Liberals took the most seats in this region. This continued amid the Liberal meltdown in Quebec in 2006, although one seat at the eastern end of the area was lost to the Bloc. Before 2011, 1984 was the only election in recent memory in which traditional Liberal dominance was seriously threatened in this region. Two former Prime Ministers, Paul Martin and Pierre Trudeau, represented ridings in this area.

Nevertheless, in 2011, several Liberal bastions, such as Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, LaSalle—Émard (Martin&#x27;s former riding), and Pierrefonds—Dollard, fell to the New Democratic surge felt throughout Quebec. Additionally, the Conservatives came very close to taking Mount Royal (Trudeau&#x27;s former riding), which has been in Liberal hands since 1940. Ultimately, the NDP took five of the region&#x27;s nine seats, with the Liberals holding the remainder. The region reverted to form in 2015, with the Liberals taking every seat here except Outremont, the riding of NDP leader Tom Mulcair.

The West End returned to a Liberal sweep when Mulcair resigned and the Liberals seized Outremont in the ensuing by-election. In 2019, the Liberals dominated the region, taking every riding by 11,000 votes or more.

<text>The Philosophical Gourmet Report, also known as the Leiter Report or PGR, is a ranking of graduate programs in philosophy in the English-speaking world. It was founded by philosophy and law professor Brian Leiter and is now edited by philosophy professors Berit Brogaard and Christopher Pynes.

==History==
===20th century===
The &quot;Gourmet Report&quot; ranking was created in response to the Gourman Report, and is based on a survey of philosophers who are nominated as evaluators by the report&#x27;s advisory board. Its purpose is to provide guidance to prospective PhD students, particularly those students who intend to pursue a professional career in academic philosophy. The report first appeared on the web in 1996; it is currently published and distributed by Blackwell.

In 1989, while he was a graduate student, Leiter made a subjective list of what he believed to be the top 25 graduate philosophy programs in the United States, which came to be the PGR. 

===21st century===
PGR was described by David L. Kirp in a 2003 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed as &quot;the bible for prospective [philosophy] graduate students.&quot; Carlin Romano, in &quot;America the Philosophical&quot; (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2013), referred to the PGR rankings as &quot;often-criticized&quot; and &quot;biased towards mainstream analytic departments&quot;.

In 2002, 175 philosophers signed an open letter calling on Leiter to stop producing the PGR. In fall 2014, over 600 philosophers signed a petition to boycott the PGR. The petition was organized by some philosophers at the University of British Columbia to protest what they called a &quot;derogatory and intimidating&quot; e-mail sent by Leiter to one of their colleagues. Leiter claimed the recipient had threatened him. Twenty-four of the 56 members of the advisory board of the PGR recommended he relinquish control over the report&#x27;s management. In response, Leiter appointed Berit Brogaard, a philosophy professor at the University of Miami, as co-editor for the 2014 report and agreed to step down as editor of subsequent editions. Leiter subsequently appointed Christopher Pynes of Western Illinois University as co-editor of future editions.

<doc id="752468" wikidata="Q4547027" url="?curid=752468" title="10th Division (Australia)">
<text>The 10th Division was a division of the Australian Army, which served briefly during World War II. It was initially formed on 15 April 1942 from the Militia units of the Newcastle Covering Force. However, personnel shortages led to the division being disbanded in August that year. 

In 1945, as plans were being made for an invasion of the Japanese home islands, the name 10th Division was revived for a proposed Australian contingent. It was to use personnel drawn from existing units of the Australian Imperial Force. The war ended before the invasion took place and the division was not formally re-raised.

==History==
===Formation and disbandment===
In April 1941, the Newcastle Covering Force was formed, taking over responsibility for the defence of Newcastle from the 1st Division. A Militia formation&#x27;s main element was initially the 1st, although the 32nd Brigade was raised in January 1942 at Warners Bay, and given control of the elements defending the area south of the Hunter River. The formation was commanded by Major General John Murray. Following the start of the Pacific War in December 1941, the Newcastle Covering Force, was mobilised. After this, its headquarters moved from Fort Scratchley to Broadmeadow. The 1st Brigade was detached to the command of the 2nd Division in March 1942 and moved to Greta to undertake a period of training; during this time the 14th Brigade was attached to the force.

The covering force was renamed the 10th Division on 15 April 1942 following a complete re-organisation of the higher command of the Australian Army. The divisional headquarters moved to New Lambton at this time. The 14th Brigade was deployed to Port Moresby in May 1942, and the 1st Brigade returned to the Newcastle Bight. As the situation in New Guinea turned in favour of the Allies, the threat to Australia reduced. This, coupled with personnel shortages, resulted in the Army deciding to disband or amalgamate a number of units. In September, the division was disbanded, along with the 32nd Brigade, and responsibility for the defence of Newcastle given solely to the 1st Brigade, which was transferred to the 1st Division.

Australian Prime Minister John Curtin referred to the disbandment of the division in a letter to Winston Churchill in October 1942, saying:
===Plans to re-raise===
Much later in the war, as Allied forces approached the Japanese home islands, planning began for a Commonwealth Corps, including an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) division, to be the re-raised 10th Division. The division was to be made up of experienced personnel from the existing divisions. The corps would have included British and Canadian divisions, and was to be part of a landing on Honshū in 1946. Regardless, the planned landing would have been dominated by US forces, and was known as Operation Coronet.

However, the introduction of the atomic bomb, and its use at Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused Japan to surrender before the invasion took place. As a result, the 10th Division was never re-raised. Instead, the decision was made to raise the 34th Brigade for occupation duties in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. This formation consisted of volunteers from the three remaining AIF divisions—the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions.

<text>Yavatmal district , formerly known as Yeotmal, is a district of the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is located in the region of Vidarbha, in the east-central part of the state. It is Vidarbha&#x27;s third-largest district by population, after Nagpur and Amravati. Yavatmal city is the administrative headquarters of the district.

==History==

It is believed that Yavatmal, along with the rest of the former Berar province, was part of the legendary kingdom of Vidarbha mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Berar also formed part of the Mauryan Empire during the reign of Ashoka (272 to 231 BCE). Berar later came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty ( to ), the Vakataka dynasty (3rd to 6th centuries), the Chalukya dynasty (6th to 8th centuries), the Rashtrakuta dynasty (8th to 10th centuries), the Western Chalukya (10th to 12th centuries), and finally the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri (late 12th to early 14th centuries). A period of Muslim rule began when Ala ud din Khilji, Sultan of Delhi, conquered the region in the early 14th century. The region was part of the Bahmani Sultanate, which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate broke into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century, and in 1572 Berar became part of the Nizam Shahi sultanate, based at Ahmednagar. The Nizam Shahis ceded Berar to the Mughal Empire in 1595. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, Asaf Jah I, Nizam of Hyderabad, seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724, forming an independent state.

A detailed account of Berar was added to the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; in 1596–97, immediately after the treaty of Ahmadnagar under which the province was ceded to the Mughal Empire; this account may be regarded as a description of the province as it was administered by the Nizam Shahi and Imad Shahi kings, and probably also by the Bahamani Sultans. The account notes that Berar was divided into thirteen sarkars or revenue districts. The Yavatmal district comprised the greater part of Akbar&#x27;s sarkars of Kalam and Mahur. But some few mahals of these sarkars lay beyond the present limits of the district. Yavatmal appears in the record as the headquarters of a pargana under the name of Yot-Lohara – &quot;Yot&quot; being the Urdu or Persian corruption of &quot;Yevata&quot;, the original name of the town; and &quot;Lohara&quot; the name of a village about to the west of Yavatmal. The suffix &quot;mal&quot; is a corruption of &quot;mahal&quot; (pargana-town). A rough estimate makes the land revenue demand in Akbar&#x27;s time for the area now occupied by the district more than ten lakhs (one million) rupees, while it is certain that collection must have fallen far short of the nominal demand.

In 1853 the district, together with the rest of Berar, came under the administration of the British East India Company. Berar was divided into East Berar and West Berar with Yavatmal district included in the former. In 1864 Yavatmal, along with some other &quot;talukas&quot;, was formed into the district initially called Southeast Berar and later renamed Wani. In 1903, Berar was leased by the Nizam of Hyderabad to the British Government of India.

== Geography ==

<doc id="752474" wikidata="Q2066077" url="?curid=752474" title="Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Canada)">
<text>In Canada, the leader of the Opposition in the Senate () is the leader of the largest party in the Canadian Senate not in government.

Even though the position&#x27;s name is very similar to the leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons (the Opposition House leader), the leader of the Opposition in the Senate&#x27;s role is more analogous to the leader of the Official Opposition because its holder is the leader of the party&#x27;s Senate caucus. The responsibilities that, in the House of Commons, are done by the house leaders—including day-to-day scheduling of business—are undertaken in the Senate by Government and Opposition deputy leaders and Opposition whips.

== Selection ==

Since it is the House of Commons of Canada that determines what party(ies) form government, the size of party caucuses in the Senate bear no relation to which party forms the government side in the Senate and which party forms the opposition. Thus, the leader of the Opposition in the Senate may lead more Senators than the leader of the Government in the Senate. Since senators normally have longer tenure than MPs, this is often the case immediately following a change in government, until the new prime minister can appoint more people from their party.

There are no set rules governing the manner in which the position is filled from within caucuses. When the Conservative Party (and its predecessor, the Progressive Conservative Party) have been in opposition, the party&#x27;s Senate caucus has historically elected its own leader, although as noted by John Williams in a 1956 book on the Conservative Party, it may choose to follow the wishes of the national leader. The traditional practice of the Liberal party in opposition had been for the party leader to select their leader in the Senate.

The leader of the Opposition in the Senate is not necessarily from the same party as the opposition in the House of Commons. From 1993 until 2003, the leader of the Opposition in the Senate was a Progressive Conservative despite the fact the Progressive Conservatives were not the Official Opposition in the House of Commons; this was because the Official Opposition in the Commons (Bloc Québécois, Reform, Canadian Alliance) did not have Senate representation. This scenario repeated itself following the results of the 2011 election that saw the Liberal Party lose Official Opposition status in the House to the New Democratic Party, but since the NDP had no representation in the Senate, the Liberals continued to form the Official Opposition in the Senate.

The Official Opposition also does not need to be linked to a party in the Commons. This was determined on January 29, 2014, after Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced that all Liberal Senators would no longer be members of the national Liberal caucus. When the Senate met in the afternoon, Senator Jim Cowan informed the Senate that the Liberal Senators intended to self-designate as Liberals, as well as sit and act together as a caucus. Following a lengthy discussion, the Senate Speaker ruled that the Liberal Senators met the definition under the Senate rules of being a caucus of at least five Senators of the same political party, that the rules state that the leader of the Opposition in the Senate is the head of the party other than the government party with the most Senators, and that &quot;as has been indicated by Senator Cowan, he has been elected by his colleagues and, therefore, meets the definition of the leader of the Opposition in the Senate.&quot; (Debates of the Senate, January 29, 2014).

<doc id="752476" wikidata="Q1968751" url="?curid=752476" title="Volkmann's contracture">
<text>Volkmann&#x27;s contracture is a permanent flexion contracture of the hand at the wrist, resulting in a claw-like deformity of the hand and fingers. Passive extension of fingers is restricted and painful.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most important signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome are observable before actual contracture. What is known as the five Ps of compartment syndrome include: pain, generally the initial symptom, accompanied by pulselessness, pallor, paralysis, and paraesthesias. Pain will likely also increase upon extension of the affected limbs hands and fingers, which is one of the earliest signs of compartment syndrome and should urgently be followed up by an exam to look for potential development of Volkmann contracture itself. Palpating for tissue firmness in the forearm, and the pulse volume and character of the radial artery, also reflects the degree of compartment syndrome.

==Causes==
Any fracture in the elbow region or upper arm may lead to Volkmann&#x27;s ischemic contracture, but it is especially associated with supracondylar fracture of the humerus. It is also caused by fractures of the forearm bones if they cause bleeding from the major blood vessels of the forearm.

The condition may be caused by obstruction on the brachial artery near the elbow, possibly from improper use of a tourniquet, improper use of a plaster cast, or compartment syndrome.

== Pathophysiology ==
Volkmann&#x27;s contracture results from acute ischaemia and necrosis of the muscle fibres of the flexor group of muscles of the forearm, especially the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus. The muscles become fibrotic and shortened.
==Prevention==
Prevention of the condition requires restoration of blood flow after injury and reduction of compartmental pressure on the muscles. Any splints, bandages, or other devices that might be obstructing circulation must be removed.

A fasciotomy may be required to reduce pressure in the muscle compartment.

== Treatment ==
If contracture occurs, surgery to release the fixed tissues may help with the deformity and function of the hand. In established stage reconstructive surgery may be needed. 

==History==
It is named after Richard von Volkmann (1830–1889), the 19th century German doctor who first described it, in a paper on &quot;non-Infective Ischemic conditions of various fascial compartments in the extremities&quot;. Because the contracture occurred at the same time as the paralysis, he considered a nerve cause to be unlikely.

<text>Sutri (Latin &quot;Sutrium&quot;) is an Ancient town, modern &quot;comune&quot; and former bishopric (now a Latin titular see) in the province of Viterbo, about from Rome and about south of Viterbo. It is picturesquely situated on a narrow tuff hill, surrounded by ravines, a narrow neck on the west alone connecting it with the surrounding country. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

The modern &quot;comune&quot; of Sutri has a few more than 5,000 inhabitants. Its ancient remains are a major draw for tourism: a Roman amphitheatre excavated in the tuff rock, an Etruscan necropolis with dozens of rock-cut tombs, a Mithraeum incorporated in the crypt of its church of the Madonna del Parto, a Romanesque Duomo.

== History ==
Ancient Sutrium occupied an important position, commanding as it did the road into Etruria, the later Via Cassia: Livy describes it as one of the keys of Etruria, nearby Nepi being the other. It came into the hands of Rome after the fall of Veii, and a Latin colony was founded there; it was lost again in 386 BC, but was recovered and recolonized around 383 BC. It was besieged by the Etruscans in 311–310 BC, but not taken. With Nepi and ten other Latin colonies it refused further help in the Second Punic War in 209 BC. Its importance as a fortress explains, according to Festus, the proverb &quot;Sutrium ire&quot;, of one who goes on important business, as it occurs in Plautus. It is mentioned in. the war of 41 BC, and received a colony of veterans under the triumviri (&quot;Colonia coniuncta lulia Sutrina&quot;). Inscriptions show that it was a place of some importance under the empire, and it is mentioned as occupied by the Lombards.

Sutri retained its strategic importance as a fortified place near the borders of the Duchy of Rome. The Donation of Sutri was an agreement reached at Sutri between the Lombard king Liutprand the Lombard and Pope Gregory II in 728. At Sutri the two reached an agreement, by which Sutri and some hill towns in Latium (see Vetralla) were given to the Papacy, &quot;as a gift to the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul&quot; according to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;. The pact formed the first extension of Papal territory beyond the confines of the Duchy of Rome. An important hoard of jewellery dating from this time, known as the Sutri Treasure, was found near the town in the 19th century. It is now in the British Museum.

Sutri, the seat of a bishopric (see below), was retrieved for the Papacy after the defeat of the Lombards.

Pope Gregory VI abdicated at Sutri on December 20, 1046, following the Synod of Sutri convened at the request of Emperor Henry III. In 1111 it was the seat of the treaty between Paschal II and Emperor Henry V; in 1146 and 1244 Eugene III and Innocent IV took refuge here, respectively. In 1244 it was conquered by Pietro di Vico, but was later taken by Pandolfo, count of Anguillara, who gave it back to the Papal States.

The city witnessed the struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines. In 1433 the condottiero Niccolò Fortebraccio set fire to Sutri, and from that point onward the city declined in favour of Ronciglione.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Established circa 500 as Diocese of Sutri (Italian) or Sutrium (Latin), without direct predecessor.

In 900 it gained canonical territory from the suppressed Diocese of Monterano.
Pope Gregory VI abdicated at Sutri on December 20, 1046, following the Synod of Sutri, a non-ecumenical council convened at the request of Emperor Henry III to resolve three rival claims to the papacy, ultimately in favor of an imperial German protégé, Pope Clement II.

On 1435.12.12 it was suppressed itself, its territory and title being merged into the newly renamed Diocese of Nepi-Sutri.

Recorded incumbent Bishops &quot;(very incomplete):&quot;
* Tommaso, Dominican Order (O.P.) (1325.06.07 – ?)

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored in 1991 as Latin Titular bishopric of Sutri (Curiate Italian) or Sutrium (Latin).

* Titular Bishop: Christoph Schönborn, Dominican order (O.P.) (1991.07.11 – 1995.04.13) as Auxiliary Bishop of Wien (Vienna, Austria) (1991.07.11 – 1995.04.13); later promoted Coadjutor Archbishop of above Wien (Austria) (1995.04.13 – 1995.09.14), succeeding as Metropolitan Archbishop of above Vienna (Wien, Austria) (1995.09.14 – ...), also Ordinary of Austria of the Eastern Rite (1995.11.06 – ...), created Cardinal-Priest of Gesù Divin Lavoratore (1998.02.21 [1998.11.22] – ...), President of Episcopal Conference of Austria (1998.06.30 – ...), Member of Commission of Cardinals overseeing the Institute for Works of Religion (2014.01.15 – ...)
* Titular Archbishop: Antonio Guido Filipazzi (2011.01.08 – ...)

== Main sights ==
The most striking edifice is the rock-hewn amphitheatre of the Roman period, one of the most suggestive monuments of the ancient Latium (Lazio). Of elliptical plan, it measures about .

There are some remains of the ancient city walls of rectangular blocks of tuff on the southern side of the town, and some rock-cut sewers in the cliffs below them.

The cathedral, of Romanesque origin, is largely modern: of the medieval edifice the belltower (1207) and the crypt, from the Lombard period, with seven naves divided by twenty columns of different origin.

In the cliffs opposite the town on the south is the rock-cut church of the &quot;Madonna del Parto&quot;, developed out of one of the numerous Etruscan tombs of the area (according to some scholars, it was a mithraeum, pagan soldier cult site).

== Transportation ==
Sutri can be reached through the Via Cassia from Rome or Viterbo. The nearest railway station, on the line for Rome, is that of Capranica.

<doc id="752483" wikidata="Q5364177" url="?curid=752483" title="USS Shark (SS-8)">
<text>USS &quot;Shark&quot; (SS-8) was the third vessel of the U.S. Navy to bear the name. She was an early in the service of the United States Navy, later renamed as A-7.

&quot;Shark&quot; was laid down on 11 January 1901 at Elizabethport, New Jersey in the Crescent Shipyard under the direction of Crescent&#x27;s superintendent, Arthur Leopold Busch. She was launched on 19 October 1901, and commissioned on 19 September 1903 at New Suffolk, New York with Lieutenant Charles P. Nelson in command.

==Early service==

Over the next three and a half years, &quot;Shark&quot; operated locally at the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, conducting firing tests with torpedoes, and participating in early research and development efforts in the field of undersea warfare. Assigned to the First Submarine Flotilla in March 1907, &quot;Shark&quot; was stationed at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in the spring of 1907.

Taken to the New York Navy Yard in April 1908, she was decommissioned there on the 21 April. Loaded onto the collier , &quot;Shark&quot; and her sister ship comprised the auxiliary&#x27;s deck cargo as she proceeded, via the Suez Canal, to the Philippines. &quot;Shark&quot; was launched soon after her arrival at Cavite in July and was recommissioned on 14 August 1908.

Over the next several years, the submarine torpedo boat operated out of Cavite, interspersing training with periodic upkeep and repair work. On 17 November 1911, &quot;Shark&quot; was renamed &quot;A-7&quot;.

==World War I==
During World War I, &quot;A-7&quot; and her sister ships based at Cavite and carried out patrols of the entrance to Manila Bay. In the early spring of 1917, Lieutenant, junior grade Arnold Marcus assumed command of &quot;A-7&quot;. On 24 July 1917, shortly after her engine had been overhauled, gasoline fumes ignited and caused an explosion and fire while in the course of a patrol in Manila Bay.

After Marcus and his men had battled the blaze, he ordered the crew topside and into the boats that had been summoned alongside. The last man to emerge from the interior of the crippled submersible, Marcus sent up distress signals to the nearby monitor and then took the helm himself in an attempt to beach the ship. He refused medical treatment until all his men had been attended to and he had to be ordered to leave his post. Marcus and six of his crew died the next day, 25 July 1917, from the effects of the explosion and fire that had ravaged &quot;A-7&quot;. The last remaining member of the crew, Fireman Second Class Arthur M. Jacobs, succumbed to his injuries on 1 August 1917. The Navy recognized Marcus&#x27; heroism by naming the destroyer in his honor.

==Later service==
Placed in ordinary at Cavite on 1 April 1918, &quot;A-7&quot; was decommissioned as of 12 December 1919. Given the alphanumeric hull number SS-8 on 17 July 1920, &quot;A-7&quot; — initially advertised for sale in the 16th Naval District — was subsequently authorized for use as a target in 1921. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 January 1922.

<text>Jan-Ove Waldner (; born 3 October 1965), in Sweden commonly &quot;J-O Waldner&quot; or simply mononymously as &quot;J-O&quot; (), is a Swedish former professional table tennis player. He is often referred to as &quot;the Mozart of table tennis.&quot; A sporting legend in his native Sweden as well as in China, he is known in China as 老瓦 &quot;Lǎo Wǎ&quot; (&quot;Old Wa&quot;) or 常青树 &quot;Cháng Qīng Shù&quot; (&quot;Evergreen Tree&quot;), because of his extraordinary longevity and competitiveness.

==Biography==
Jan-Ove Waldner was born in Stockholm on 3 October 1965. His athletic potential was recognised at an early age and was displayed in 1982 when, as a 16-year-old, he reached the final of the European Championships, losing to distinguished left-handed teammate Mikael Appelgren, who was perceived then as the logical successor to the first Swedish World Champion, Stellan Bengtsson. While still developing his game, Waldner, along with several other Swedish players, traveled to a national-level training camp held in China, and was reportedly amazed by the dedication and solidarity of the Chinese players. He has claimed ever since that he learned much during his stay, and thereafter first began to regard his opportunity to succeed in table tennis as paramount.

Waldner won gold in the men&#x27;s singles at 1992 Summer Olympics, becoming the first and to date only player not from China, Japan, or South Korea to win an Olympic table tennis title. Eight years later, he won silver in the same event at the 2000 Summer Olympics, narrowly losing to Kong Linghui.

In China, a country that adores table tennis, he is undisputedly the best-known Swedish person, and still one of the most well-known sports personalities. In the 1990s, he was more recognisable in China than then-President of the United States Bill Clinton. His venerable status and long career has led to his being nicknamed &quot;the Evergreen Tree&quot; (Changqing Shu 常青树) in Mandarin. He is considered by many to be the most technically complete player of all time, and is almost inarguably the most successful non-Chinese player of the sport.

In 2010 Waldner won his ninth Swedish championship, defeating Pär Gerell, who was born the same year Waldner became Swedish national champion for the first time.

He played for TTC Rhön-Sprudel Fulda-Maberzell in the German Bundesliga until May 2012. In May 2012 Stefan Frauenholz, Fulda-Maberzell&#x27;s President, confirmed that Jan-Ove Waldner had finished his contract with the club. Timo Boll: &quot;Was yesterday&#x27;s match against us the last one for Jan-Ove Waldner?&quot;, referring to the Bundesliga semifinal between Borussia Düsseldorf and Fulda-Maberzell. This ended his career at the international elite level, at the age of 46 years.

In 2012 he began playing for Spårvägens BTK.

On 11 February 2016, Waldner played his last game in the Swedish first league for Ängby/Spårvägen and officially announced his retirement as a player.

When he retired, Waldner had been playing international elite level table tennis for more than thirty years, which is somewhat unusual in the table tennis world given that hand–eye coordination and quick reactions are essential. Some young Chinese players whom he has recently played against were trained by those he played against in the 1990s, who were in turn trained by others he played in the 1980s.

He is one of the seven table tennis players who competed at the first five Olympic Games table tennis tournaments since the sport&#x27;s introduction at the Games in 1988. The others are Swede Jörgen Persson, Croatian Zoran Primorac, Belgian Jean-Michel Saive, Hungarian Csilla Bátorfi, Serbian-American Ilija Lupulesku, and German Jörg Roßkopf.

He was also the first of only six male players in the history of table tennis to achieve a career grand slam (World Champion, World Cup and Olympic gold medal winner in singles) (in 1992). The others are: Liu Guoliang, China (in 1999), Kong Linghui, China (in 2000), Zhang Jike, China (in 2012), Ma Long, China (in 2016), and Fan Zhendong, China (in 2024).

<text>Assebroek () is a sub-municipality of the city of Bruges located in the province of West Flanders, Flemish Region, Belgium. It was a separate municipality until 1971. On 1 January 1971, it was merged into Bruges. On 31 December 2014, Assebroek had 19,737 inhabitants. Since 1999, this number has hardly changed. Assebroek is home to 16.75% of Bruges’ population.

== History ==

Through artifacts retrieved near Saint-Lucas hospital (and stored at Gruuthusemuseum in Bruges) we assume that the &quot;Leitje&quot; region was already inhabited in the Stone Age.

Aerial views of the &quot;Ver-Assebroekse meersen&quot; reveals an approximately 300 m-wide ring of ditches and rampart complex dating from the 5th century where the lords of Assebroek later built their castle.

Apparently around the 12th century, a lord called &quot;Boudewijn of Assebroek&quot; bought his domain – limited by Oostkamp, Oedelem, Michel van Hamme street, Astridlaan and Lorreinendreef - free from Sijsele.

The Assebroek municipality only consisted of some scattered maisonnettes and a mill along the old road to Bruges. Instigated by the &quot;lords of Assebroek&quot;, a local church and &quot;Engelendale&quot; convent were established.

Nowadays Assebroek includes 6 parishes: &quot;Immaculata&quot; (Ver-Assebroek), &quot;Assumpta&quot;, &quot;Saint Lutgardis&quot;, &quot;Saint Catharina&quot;, &quot;Saint Christopher&quot;, and &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; (Steenbrugge).

== Etymology ==

Before the 20th Century, the town&#x27;s name was recorded as &quot;Ars(e)brouc&quot;, later becoming &quot;Assebroek&quot;.

&quot;Ars(e)brouc&quot; probably meant &quot;wetland with horses&quot;. The medieval Dutch &quot;Arse&quot; or &quot;Ors&quot; being &quot;horses&quot; and &quot;brouc&quot; meaning &quot;marsh&quot;. In medieval times, the &quot;Meersen&quot; area had several inns, all named after horses, with only the ruin of &quot;The Flying Horse&quot; in &quot;Oedelem&quot; is still standing. Some sources claim &quot;Arse&quot; stands for &quot;ashes&quot; so that &quot;Assebroek&quot; would mean &quot;marsh surrounded by ashes&quot;.

== Geography ==

Assebroek is situated on a lower sand plain south west of Bruges. Forming a typical polder landscape, in winter an area called &quot;Assebroekse Meersen&quot;, characterised by small grass fields separated by willow trees often gets flooded.

The &quot;Meersen area&quot; arose as prolongation within the so-called &quot;Flemish Valley&quot;. The slope contains sand, lime and peat deposits from the Holocene Epoch. Underneath the peat remains an approx. 30 cm marsh lime layer from the early Holocene. 10,000 years ago, this region was a real marsh.

== Assebroek - a sacred place ==

Each year thousands of pilgrims honour the miraculous figurine of The Madonna at Ver-Assebroek and pray with the Benedictine monks of Steenbrugge. According to the legend (represented by the stained-glass windows in the church) this marble figurine floated when the &quot;Geuzen&quot; threw it into the sea.

== Assebroek beer community ==

In medieval times, the inner city of Bruges imposed significant taxes on beer consumption. Hence so called &quot;outside drinkers&quot; found their way to Assebroek&#x27;s inns till the early morning when Bruges’ city gates were opened.

Many beers are named after this place (&quot;Steenbrugge Blonde&quot;, &quot;Steenbrugge Double Brown&quot;, &quot;Steenbrugge Triple&quot; and &quot;Steenbrugge White&quot;) or were locally brewed by the Regenboog Brewery (now moved to Mater).

<text>Koolkerke () is a sub-municipality of the city of Bruges located in the province of West Flanders, Flemish Region, Belgium. It was a separate municipality until 1971. On 1 January 1971, it was merged into Bruges.

== History ==
Although Roman remains have been found, the first written mention of the village Koolkerke dates from the 12th century. The name &quot;Coolkercke&quot; was first mentioned in 1243. The Old Zwin, a watercourse which connected Bruges to the Zwin in Knokke and the Nortsea, ran past the village. Old Zwin silted up, replaced by a canal constructed by the order of Napoleon and two forts were built in the 17th century: Fort Lapin south of Koolkerke and the &#x27;Fort de Bavière&#x27; or Fort van Beieren, the remains of this can be seen today.

It is believed that the name derives from Kool, a short version of the name Nicolas, hence from the church of St Nicholas. The church in Koolkerke was named by the settlement&#x27;s founder, Nicolaas Gaillaerd.

Other local attractions include the old windmill Ter Panne, and the Groene Poort castle, Dudzeelse steenweg 460 (now called Château Rougesse).

<text>Dąbie is a town on the Ner River in central Poland with 1,940 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is situated in Koło County in Greater Poland Voivodeship. It is located within the historic Łęczyca Land.

==History==
In the 10th century, the area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I. The town was first mentioned in 1232. Municipal status was granted in 1423. It was a royal town, administratively located in the Łęczyca County in the Łęczyca Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

Before World War II, about 1,000 Jews lived in Dąbie. During the German occupation, they were confined to a ghetto in summer of 1940. Some were sent to forced labor camps, but most were sent directly to Chełmno extermination camp in December 1941 where they were gassed in specially adapted vans. Only a few Dąbie Jews survived the war. The Polish resistance was active in the town, and Polish underground press was distributed there.

==Transport==
Dąbie is located at the intersection of Voivodeship roads 263 and 473, and the A2 motorway runs nearby, south of the town.

<doc id="752521" wikidata="Q7892493" url="?curid=752521" title="United States government role in civil aviation">
<text>The Air Commerce Act of 1926 created an Aeronautic Branch of the United States Department of Commerce. Its functions included testing and licensing of pilots, certification of aircraft and investigation of accidents.

In 1934, the Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce, to reflect the growing importance of commercial flying. It was subsequently divided into two authorities: the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), concerned with air traffic control, and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), concerned with safety regulations and accident investigation. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, the CAA&#x27;s powers were transferred to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In the same year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created after the Soviet Union’s launch of the first artificial satellite.
The accident investigation powers of the CAB were transferred to the new National Transportation Safety Board in 1967, at the same time that the United States Department of Transportation was created.

In response to the September 11 attacks, the federal government launched the Transportation Security Administration with broad powers to protect air travel and other transportation modes against criminal activity.

==National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and airmail==
European enthusiasm for air power was sparked by an arms race and then by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. During the following year, the United States Congress took a step toward revitalizing American aviation by establishing the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), an organization dedicated to the science of flight.

Upon entering World War I in 1917, the United States government mobilized the nation&#x27;s economy, with results that included an expansion of the small aviation manufacturing industry. Before the end of the conflict, Congress voted funds for an innovative postal program that would serve as a model for commercial air operations. With initial help from the U.S. Army, the Post Office in 1918 initiated an intercity airmail route. The subsequent achievements of the Air Mail Service included the establishment of a transcontinental route and the development of airway lighting.

In 1925, the Airmail Act of 1925 authorized the Post Office to contract with private airlines to transport mail. The Airmail Act created American commercial aviation and several of today&#x27;s airlines were formed to carry airmail in the late 1920s (including Trans World Airlines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines).

==Air Commerce Act==

Aviation in the United States was not regulated during the early 20th century. A succession of accidents during the pre-war exhibition era (1910–16) and barnstorming decade of the 1920s gave way to early forms of federal regulation intended to instill public confidence in the safety of air transportation. As claimed by the &quot;Aircraft Year Book&quot;, barnstormers caused 66% of fatal accidents during 1924. Opponents of this view included those who distrusted government interference or wished to leave any such regulation to state authorities. Barnstorming accidents that led to such regulations during this period are accurately depicted in the 1975 film &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot;.

At the urging of the aviation industry, that believed the airplane could not reach its full commercial potential without federal action to improve and maintain safety standards, President Calvin Coolidge appointed a board to investigate the issue. The board&#x27;s report favored federal safety regulation. To that end, the Air Commerce Act became law on May 20, 1926. The act was sponsored by Rep. Laurence H. Watres, and subsequently referred to as the Watres Act.

The Act created an Aeronautic Branch assigned to the United States Department of Commerce, and vested that entity with regulatory powers to ensure a degree of civil air safety. Among these powers were: testing and licensing pilots, issuing certificates to guarantee the airworthiness of aircraft, making and enforcing safety rules, certificating aircraft, establishing airways, operating and maintaining aids to air navigation, and investigating accidents and incidents in aviation. The first head of the Branch was William P. MacCracken, Jr. High visibility accidents such as the 1931 Transcontinental &amp; Western Air Fokker F-10 crash and the 1935 crash of TWA Flight 6 continued to make headlines.

In fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the Department of Commerce initially concentrated on functions such as safety rulemaking and the certification of pilots and aircraft. It took over the building and operation of the nation&#x27;s system of lighted airways, a task begun by the Post Office Department. The Department of Commerce improved aeronautical radio communications, and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation.

In 1934, the Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce. As commercial aviation grew, the Bureau encouraged airlines to establish three centers (Newark, New Jersey; Cleveland, Ohio; and Chicago, Illinois) to provide air traffic control in airways. In 1936, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system. Pioneer air traffic controllers resorted to using maps, blackboards, and calculations to perform their new roles, making sure aircraft traveling along designated routes did not collide.

==Bureau of Air Commerce==
The Department of Commerce created an Aeronautics Branch in 1926. The first head of this organization was William P. MacCracken, Jr. (first recipient of its pilot certification license), whose approach to regulation included consultation and cooperation with industry. A major challenge facing MacCracken was to enlarge and improve the nation&#x27;s air navigation system. The Aeronautics Branch took over the Post Office&#x27;s task of building airway light beacons, and in 1928 introduced a new navigation beacon system known as the low frequency radio range, or the &quot;Four Course Radio Range&quot;. The branch also built additional airway communications stations to encourage broader use of aeronautical radio and combat adverse weather.

NACA began its own aeronautics research undertaking in 1920. In 1928, having created one of the first wind tunnels years earlier, the organization&#x27;s work with the latter produced a new type of engine cowling with much less drag than former designs.

Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Aeronautics Branch cooperated with public works agencies on projects that represented an early form of federal aid to airports. The Branch was restructured and in 1934 received a new name, the Bureau of Air Commerce. Eugene Vidal, nephew of Senator Thomas Gore became its first director. Vidal resigned on February 28, 1937, and was replaced by Fred D. Fagg, Jr. Fagg reorganized the bureau, but retired in April 1938, being replaced by &quot;Hindenburg&quot; crash investigator Denis Mulligan.

The year 1934 also saw a crisis over airmail contracts that former Postmaster General W.F. Brown had used to strengthen the airline route structure. In the Air Mail scandal, Senate investigators charged that Brown&#x27;s methods had been illegal, and President Roosevelt canceled the contracts. In 1935 the BAC encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers (Newark, New Jersey; Cleveland, Ohio; and Chicago, Illinois) for providing air traffic control along the airways, the following year taking over the centers itself and expanding the traffic control system.

== Civil Aeronautics Authority ==
In 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred federal responsibilities for non-military aviation from the Bureau of Air Commerce to a new, independent agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The legislation also gave the authority the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve.

===Civil Aeronautics Administration and Civil Aeronautics Board===

In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt split the Civil Aeronautics Authority into two agencies, the Civil Aeronautics Administration and a five-member Civil Aeronautics Board. The CAA was responsible for air traffic control, safety programs, and airway development. The CAB was entrusted with safety rulemaking, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. Although both organizations were housed in the Department of Commerce, the CAB functioned independently. When a Douglas DC-3A crashed shortly after departing Washington, DC, on August 31, 1940, the CAB had their first major investigation, that of the Lovettsville air disaster, setting the pattern for subsequent accident investigations.

In 1942, President Roosevelt appointed L. Welch Pogue as Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board. Pogue served as Chairman until 1946. During his tenure he helped strike down a plan for a single world airline.

After World War II began in Europe, the CAA launched the Civilian Pilot Training Program to provide new pilots. On the eve of America&#x27;s entry into the conflict, the agency began to take over operation of airport control towers, a role that eventually became permanent. During the war, the CAA also greatly enlarged its en route air traffic control system. In 1944, the United States hosted a conference in Chicago that led to the establishment of the International Civil Aviation Organization and set the framework for future aviation diplomacy. In 1946, Congress gave the CAA the task of administering a federal-aid airport program aimed exclusively at promoting development of the United States&#x27; civil airports.

This included the establishment of semi-permanent colonies in remote, U.S.-owned territories, such as the Palmyra Atoll, where beginning in 1948, nearly 100 men, women, and children were sent to live and work. They occupied the facilities of what had been a Navy refueling base during World War II, manning its radio station and maintaining the 6,000-foot runway. Strangely, this community was dispersed in 1949, and while the exact reasons why are unclear, it was likely because the benefits of operating the facilities did not outweigh the cost of providing for the colony members.

==Federal Aviation Administration and NASA==
Several mid-air collisions occurred during the latter half of the 20th century, such as the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision, the first time more than 100 people were killed. Jet travel was nascent at this time, prompting the passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The legislation gave the CAA&#x27;s functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency. The act transferred safety rulemaking from CAB to the new FAA (the CAB continued), and also made the FAA responsible for a common civil-military system of air navigation and air traffic control. The FAA&#x27;s first administrator, Elwood R. Quesada, was a former U.S. Air Force Lt. General who commanded the early tactical air forces of the Ninth Air Force in Europe in World War II, and served as an advisor to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

The same year witnessed the transformation of NACA into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the wake of the Soviet Union&#x27;s launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik. NASA assumed NACA&#x27;s role of aeronautical research.

==Department of Transportation, NTSB and TSA==
The accident investigation powers of the Civil Aeronautics Board were transferred to the new National Transportation Safety Board in 1967, at the same time that the United States Department of Transportation was created. The CAB&#x27;s remaining authority was economic regulation of commercial air transportation. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 phased out these controls, resulting in the elimination of the CAB at the end of 1984, with most residual powers transferred to the DOT.

The September 11, 2001 attacks challenged the air transportation system by presenting a new type of terrorist attack: hijacked airliners used for terrorist attacks. The government&#x27;s response included the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, enacted that November, that established a new DOT organization: the Transportation Security Administration. It received broad powers to protect air travel and other transportation modes against criminal activity.

<text>The Histories (, &quot;Historíai&quot;; also known as The History) of Herodotus (Ancient Greek: Ἡρόδοτος, romanized: Hēródotos; c. 484 – c. 425 BC) is considered the founding work of history in Western literature. Although not a fully impartial record, it remains one of the West&#x27;s most important sources regarding these affairs. Moreover, it established the genre and study of history in the Western world (despite the existence of historical records and chronicles beforehand).

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Histories&quot; also stands as one of the earliest accounts of the rise of the Persian Empire, as well as the events and causes of the Greco-Persian Wars between the Persian Empire and the Greek city-states in the 5th century BC. Herodotus portrays the conflict as one between the forces of slavery (the Persians) on the one hand, and freedom (the Athenians and the confederacy of Greek city-states which united against the invaders) on the other. &quot;The Histories&quot; was at some point divided into the nine books that appear in modern editions, conventionally named after the nine Muses.

The oldest extant copy of &quot;Histories&quot; by Herodotus are manuscripts from the Byzantine period dating back to the 9th and 10th centuries CE, the (Codex Laurentianus (Codex A))

==Motivation for writing==
Herodotus claims to have traveled extensively around the ancient world, conducting interviews and collecting stories for his book, almost all of which covers territories of the Persian Empire. At the beginning of &quot;The Histories&quot;, Herodotus sets out his reasons for writing it:

In his introduction to Hecataeus&#x27; work, &quot;Genealogies&quot;:

This points forward to the &quot;folksy&quot; yet &quot;international&quot; outlook typical of Herodotus. However, one modern scholar has described the work of Hecataeus as &quot;a curious false start to history,&quot; since despite his critical spirit, he failed to liberate history from myth. Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his &quot;Histories&quot;, on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history. It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by Porphyry in a quote recorded by Eusebius. In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the crocodile, hippopotamus, and phoenix from Hecataeus&#x27;s &quot;Circumnavigation of the Known World&quot; (&quot;Periegesis&quot; / &quot;Periodos ges&quot;), even misrepresenting the source as &quot;Heliopolitans&quot; (&quot;Histories&quot; 2.73).

But Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history. There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times. Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism. For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (&quot;Histories&quot; 4.36 and 4.42). However, he retains idealizing tendencies, as in his symmetrical notions of the Danube and Nile.

His debt to previous authors of prose &quot;histories&quot; might be questionable, but there is no doubt that Herodotus owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers. For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the hubris of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure. His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Persae&quot;, including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at Salamis caused the defeat of the land army (&quot;Histories&quot; 8.68 ~ &quot;Persae&quot; 728). The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of &quot;The Histories&quot; in his plays, especially a passage in &quot;Antigone&quot; that resembles Herodotus&#x27;s account of the death of Intaphernes (&quot;Histories&quot; 3.119 ~ &quot;Antigone&quot; 904–920). However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.

Homer was another inspirational source. Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.

== Mode of explanation ==
Herodotus writes with the purpose of explaining; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of an event. He lays this out in the preamble: &quot;This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, &quot;to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other&quot;.&quot;

This mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer, who opened the &quot;Iliad&quot; by asking:

:&quot;Which of the immortals set these two at each other&#x27;s throats?&quot;
:&quot;Zeus&#x27; son and Leto&#x27;s, offended&quot;
:&quot;by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored&quot;
:&quot;Chryses, Apollo&#x27;s priest, so the god&quot;
:&quot;struck the Greek camp with plague,&quot;
:&quot;and the soldiers were dying of it.&quot;

Both Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homer&#x27;s case, &quot;who set these two at each other&#x27;s throats?&quot; In Herodotus&#x27;s case, &quot;Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?&quot;

Herodotus&#x27;s means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that &quot;the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.&quot;

Some readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.

=== Types of causality ===
Herodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from Homer onward. Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question &quot;why did this happen?&quot; but rather &quot;why did this happen to me?&quot; By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.

Some authors, including Geoffrey de Ste-Croix and Mabel Lang, have argued that Fate, or the belief that &quot;this is how it had to be,&quot; is Herodotus&#x27;s ultimate understanding of causality. Herodotus&#x27;s explanation that an event &quot;was going to happen&quot; maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of &quot;it was going to happen&quot; reveals a &quot;tragic discovery&quot; associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; as well.

John Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a &quot;philosophy of history&quot; or &quot;simple causality.&quot; Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus&#x27;s means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:

==Reliability==
The accuracy of the works of Herodotus has been controversial since his own era. Kenton L. Sparks writes, &quot;In antiquity, Herodotus had acquired the reputation of being unreliable, biased, parsimonious in his praise of heroes, and mendacious&quot;. The historian Duris of Samos called Herodotus a &quot;myth-monger&quot;. Cicero (&quot;On the Laws&quot; I.5) said that his works were full of legends or &quot;fables&quot;. The controversy was also commented on by Aristotle, Flavius Josephus and Plutarch. The Alexandrian grammarian Harpocration wrote a whole book on &quot;the lies of Herodotus&quot;. Lucian of Samosata went as far as to deny the &quot;father of history&quot; a place among the famous on the Island of the Blessed in his &quot;Verae Historiae&quot;.

The works of Thucydides were often given preference for their &quot;truthfulness and reliability&quot;, even if Thucydides basically continued on foundations laid by Herodotus, as in his treatment of the Persian Wars. In spite of these lines of criticism, Herodotus&#x27; works were in general kept in high esteem and regarded as reliable by many. Many scholars, ancient and modern (such as Strabo, A. H. L. Heeren, etc.), routinely cited Herodotus.

To this day, some scholars regard his works as being at least partly unreliable. Detlev Fehling writes of &quot;a problem recognized by everybody&quot;, namely that Herodotus frequently cannot be taken at face value. Fehling argues that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources. For Fehling, the sources of many stories, as reported by Herodotus, do not appear credible in themselves. Persian and Egyptian informants tell stories that dovetail neatly into Greek myths and literature, yet show no signs of knowing their own traditions. For Fehling, the only credible explanation is that Herodotus invented these sources, and that the stories themselves were concocted by Herodotus himself.

Like many ancient historians, Herodotus preferred an element of show to purely analytic history, aiming to give pleasure with &quot;exciting events, great dramas, bizarre exotica.&quot; As such, certain passages have been the subject of controversy and even some doubt, both in antiquity and today.

Despite the controversy, Herodotus has long served and still serves as the primary, often only, source for events in the Greek world, Persian Empire, and the broader region in the two centuries leading up to his own days. So even if the &quot;Histories&quot; were criticized in some regards since antiquity, modern historians and philosophers generally take a more positive view as to their source and epistemologic value. Herodotus is variously considered &quot;father of comparative anthropology,&quot; &quot;the father of ethnography,&quot; and &quot;more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history.&quot;

Discoveries made since the end of the 19th century have generally added to Herodotus&#x27; credibility. He described Gelonus, located in Scythia, as a city thousands of times larger than Troy; this was widely disbelieved until it was rediscovered in 1975. The archaeological study of the now-submerged ancient Egyptian city of Heracleion and the recovery of the so-called &quot;Naucratis stela&quot; give credibility to Herodotus&#x27;s previously unsupported claim that Heracleion was founded during the Egyptian New Kingdom.

===Babylon===
Herodotus claimed to have visited Babylon. The absence of any mention of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon in his work has attracted further attacks on his credibility. In response, Dalley has proposed that the Hanging Gardens may have been in Nineveh rather than in Babylon.

===Egypt===
The reliability of Herodotus&#x27;s writing about Egypt is sometimes questioned. Alan B. Lloyd argues that, as a historical document, the writings of Herodotus are seriously defective, and that he was working from &quot;inadequate sources.&quot; Nielsen writes: &quot;Though we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of Herodotus having been in Egypt, it must be said that his narrative bears little witness to it.&quot; German historian Detlev Fehling questions whether Herodotus ever traveled up the Nile River, and considers doubtful almost everything that he says about Egypt and Ethiopia. Fehling states that &quot;there is not the slightest bit of history behind the whole story&quot; about the claim of Herodotus that Pharaoh Sesostris campaigned in Europe, and that he left a colony in Colchia. Fehling concludes that the works of Herodotus are intended as fiction. Boedeker concurs that much of the content of the works of Herodotus are literary devices.

However, a recent discovery of a baris (described in &quot;The Histories&quot;) during an excavation of the sunken Egyptian port city of Thonis-Heracleion lends credence to Herodotus&#x27;s travels and storytelling.

Herodotus&#x27; contribution to the history and ethnography of ancient Egypt and Africa was especially valued by various historians of the field (such as Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney, W. E. B. Du Bois, Pierre Montet, Martin Bernal, Basil Davidson, Derek A. Welsby, Henry T. Aubin). Many scholars explicitly mention the reliability of Herodotus&#x27;s work (such as on the Nile Valley) and demonstrate corroboration of Herodotus&#x27; writings by modern scholars. A. H. L. Heeren quoted Herodotus throughout his work and provided corroboration by scholars regarding several passages (source of the Nile, location of Meroë, etc.).

Cheikh Anta Diop provides several examples (like the inundations of the Nile) which, he argues, support his view that Herodotus was &quot;quite scrupulous, objective, scientific for his time.&quot; Diop argues that Herodotus &quot;always distinguishes carefully between what he has seen and what he has been told.&quot; Diop also notes that Strabo corroborated Herodotus&#x27; ideas about the Black Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Colchians. Martin Bernal has relied on Herodotus &quot;to an extraordinary degree&quot; in his controversial book &quot;Black Athena&quot;.

British egyptologist Derek A. Welsby said that &quot;archaeology graphically confirms Herodotus&#x27;s observations.&quot; To further his work on the Egyptians and Assyrians, historian and fiction writer Henry T. Aubin used Herodotus&#x27; accounts in various passages. For Aubin, Herodotus was &quot;the author of the first important narrative history of the world.&quot;

===Scientific reasoning===
====On geography====
Herodotus provides much information about the nature of the world and the status of science during his lifetime, often engaging in private speculation likewise. For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the Nile was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff). He also passes on reports from Phoenician sailors that, while circumnavigating Africa, they &quot;saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards&quot;, although, being unaware of the existence of the southern hemisphere, he says that he does not believe the claim. Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been. His accounts of India are among the oldest records of Indian civilization by an outsider.

====On biology====


After journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist Michel Peissel claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in the &quot;Histories&quot;. In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry &quot;ants&quot; lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the Persian Empire. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Later Pliny the Elder would mention this story in the gold mining section of his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;.

Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the Deosai Plateau in Gilgit–Baltistan province, there is a species of marmot – the Himalayan marmot, a type of burrowing squirrel – that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the Minaro tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their burrows.

Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for &quot;marmot&quot; with the word for &quot;mountain ant.&quot; Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described. Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the &quot;ants&quot; are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.

===Accusations of bias===
Some &quot;calumnious fictions&quot; were written about Herodotus in a work titled &quot;On the Malice of Herodotus&quot; by Plutarch, a Chaeronean by birth, (or it might have been a Pseudo-Plutarch, in this case &quot;a great collector of slanders&quot;), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school. Similarly, in a &quot;Corinthian Oration&quot;, Dio Chrysostom (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against Corinth, sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments – an account also given by Marcellinus in his &quot;Life of Thucydides&quot;. In fact, Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with Periclean Athens becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece. As a result, his reports about Greek events are often coloured by Athenian bias against rival states – Thebes and Corinth in particular.

=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===
It is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the &quot;Histories&quot; that Herodotus uses (or at least claims to use) various sources in his narrative. K. H. Waters relates that &quot;Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being &quot;philobarbaros&quot;, a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.&quot;

Herodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io. However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: &quot;I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man &quot;who I know for a fact&quot; began the wrong-doing against the Greeks.&quot; Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: &quot;I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.&quot;

Throughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states &quot;[Solon] sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, &quot;but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down&quot;.&quot; Again, in the story about Croesus and his son&#x27;s death, when speaking of Adrastus (the man who accidentally killed Croesus&#x27; son), Herodotus states: &quot;Adrastus ... &quot;believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known&quot;, cut his own throat over the grave.&quot;
==Herodotus and myth==
Although Herodotus considered his &quot;inquiries&quot; a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his historical method, by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability. While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that &quot;many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man&quot; (IX, 100).

In Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of Arion, the renowned harp player, &quot;second to no man living at that time,&quot; who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that &quot;a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,&quot; and alleges its veracity by adding that the &quot;Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter.&quot; Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore.

Herodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotus&#x27;s dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought – Herodotus as centaur:

Herodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales – he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the &quot;Histories&quot;, we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual. For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.

<text>Being and Time () is the 1927 &quot;magnum opus&quot; of German philosopher Martin Heidegger and a key document of existentialism. &quot;Being and Time&quot; had a notable impact on subsequent philosophy, literary theory and many other fields. Though controversial, its stature in intellectual history has been compared with works by Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel. The book attempts to revive ontology through an analysis of Dasein, or &quot;being-in-the-world.&quot; It is also noted for an array of neologisms and complex language, as well as an extended treatment of &quot;authenticity&quot; as a means to grasp and confront the unique and finite possibilities of the individual.

==Background==
Richard Wolin notes that the work &quot;implicitly adopted the critique of mass society” epitomized earlier by Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. &quot;Elitist complaints about the &#x27;dictatorship of public opinion&#x27; were common currency to the German mandarins of the twenties,&quot; according to J. Habermas (1989). Wolin writes that &quot;Being and Time&quot; is &quot;suffused by a sensibility derived from secularized Protestantism” and its stress on original sin. The human condition is portrayed as &quot;essentially a curse.” Wolin cites the work&#x27;s extended emphasis on “emotionally laden concepts” like guilt, conscience, angst and death.

The book is likened to a secularized version of Martin Luther&#x27;s project, which aimed to turn Christian theology back to an earlier and more “original” phase. Taking this view, John D. Caputo notes that Heidegger made a systematic study of Luther in the 1920s after training for 10 years as a Catholic theologian. Similarly, Hubert Dreyfus likens Division II of the volume to a secularized version of Kierkegaard&#x27;s Christianity. Almost all central concepts of &quot;Being and Time&quot; are derived from Augustine, Luther, and Kierkegaard, according to Christian Lotz.

The critic George Steiner argues that &quot;Being and Time&quot; is a product of the crisis of German culture following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I. In this respect Steiner compared it to Ernst Bloch&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Utopia&quot; (1918), Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; (1918), Franz Rosenzweig&#x27;s &quot;The Star of Redemption&quot; (1921), Karl Barth&#x27;s &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot; (1922), and Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (1925).

In terms of structure, &quot;Being and Time&quot; consists of the lengthy two-part introduction, followed by Division One, the &quot;Preparatory Fundamental Analysis of Dasein,&quot; and Division Two, &quot;Dasein and Temporality.” Heidegger originally planned to write a separate, second volume but quickly abandoned the project. The unwritten “second half” was to include a critique of Western philosophy.

==Summary==
===&quot;Dasein&quot;===
&quot;Being and Time&quot; explicitly rejects Descartes&#x27; notion of the human being as a subjective spectator of objects, according to Marcella Horrigan-Kelly (et al.). The book instead holds that both subject and object are inseparable. In presenting the subject, &quot;being&quot; as inseparable from the objective &quot;world,&quot; Heidegger introduced the term “Dasein” (literally being there), intended to embody a ‘‘living being’’ through their activity of ‘’being there” and “being in the world” (Horrigan-Kelly). Understood as a unitary phenomenon rather than a contingent, additive combination, being-in-the-world is an essential characteristic of Dasein, according to Michael Wheeler (2011).

Heidegger&#x27;s account of Dasein passes through an analysis of &quot;Angst,&quot; &quot;the Nothing&quot; and mortality, and of the structure of &quot;Care&quot; as such. He then defines &quot;authenticity,&quot; as a means to grasp and confront the finite possibilities of Dasein. Moreover, Dasein is &quot;the being that will give access to the question of the meaning of Being,&quot; according to Heidegger.

===Being===
The work claims that ordinary and even mundane &quot;being-in-the-world&quot; provides &quot;access to the meaning, or &#x27;sense of being.&#x27; [&quot;Sinn des Seins&quot;].&quot; This access via Dasein is also that &quot;in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something.&quot; This meaning would then elucidate ordinary &quot;prescientific&quot; understanding, which precedes abstract ways of knowing, such as logic or theory.

Heidegger&#x27;s concept of Being is metaphorical, according to Richard Rorty, who agrees with Heidegger that there is no &quot;hidden power&quot; called Being. Heidegger emphasizes that no particular understanding of Being (nor of Dasein) is to be valued over another, according to an account of Rorty&#x27;s analysis by Edward Grippe. This supposed &quot;non-linguistic, pre-cognitive access&quot; to the meaning of Being didn&#x27;t underscore any particular, preferred narrative.

Thomas Sheehan and Mark Wrathall each separately assert that commentators&#x27; emphasis on the term &quot;Being&quot; is misplaced, and that Heidegger&#x27;s central focus was never on &quot;Being&quot; as such. Wrathall wrote (2011) that Heidegger&#x27;s elaborate concept of &quot;unconcealment&quot; was his central, life-long focus, while Sheehan (2015) proposed that the philosopher&#x27;s prime focus was on that which &quot;brings about being as a givenness of entities.&quot;)
&quot;Being and Time&quot; actually offers &quot;no sense of how we might answer the question of being as such,&quot; writes Simon Critchley in a nine-part blog commentary on the work for &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2009). The book instead provides &quot;an answer to the question of what it means to be human&quot; (Critchley). Nonetheless, Heidegger does present the concept: &quot;&#x27;Being&#x27; is not something like a being but is rather &quot;what determines beings as beings.&quot;

===Time===
Heidegger believes that time finds its meaning in death, according to Michael Kelley. That is, time is understood only from a finite or mortal vantage. Dasein&#x27;s fundamental characteristic and mode of &quot;being-in-the-world&quot; is temporal: Having been &quot;thrown&quot; into a world implies a &quot;pastness&quot; in its being. &quot;The present is the nodal moment which makes past and future intelligible,&quot; writes Lilian Alweiss. Dasein occupies itself with the present tasks required by goals it has projected on the future.

Dasein as an intertwined subject/object cannot be separated from its objective &quot;historicality,&quot; a concept Heidegger credits in the text to Wilhelm Dilthey. Dasein is &quot;stretched along&quot; temporally between birth and death, and thrown into its world; into its future &quot;possibilities&quot; which &quot;Dasein&quot; is charged with assuming. &quot;Dasein&#x27;s&quot; access to this world and these possibilities is always via a history and a tradition—or &quot;world historicality&quot;.

==Methodologies==
===Phenomenology===

Heidegger&#x27;s mentor Edmund Husserl developed a method of analysis called &quot;phenomenological reduction&quot; or &quot;bracketing,&quot; that emphasized primordial experience as its key element. Husserl used this method to define the structures of consciousness and show how they are directed at both real and ideal objects within the world.

&quot;Being and Time&quot; employs this method but purportedly modifies Husserl&#x27;s subjectivist tendencies. Whereas Husserl conceived humans as constituted by consciousness, Heidegger countered that consciousness is peripheral to Dasein, which cannot be reduced to consciousness. Consciousness is thus an &quot;effect&quot; rather than a determinant of existence. By shifting the priority from consciousness (psychology) to existence (ontology), Heidegger altered the subsequent direction of phenomenology.

But &quot;Being and Time&quot; misrepresented its phenomenology as a departure from methods established earlier by Husserl, according to Daniel O. Dahlstrom. In this vein, Robert J. Dostal asserts that &quot;if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger&#x27;s approach,&quot; then it&#x27;s impossible to exactly understand &quot;Being and Time&quot;.

On publication in 1927, &quot;Being and Time&quot; bore a dedication to Husserl, who beginning a decade earlier, championed Heidegger&#x27;s work, and helped him secure the retiring Husserl&#x27;s chair in Philosophy at the University of Freiburg in 1928. Because Husserl was Jewish, in 1941 Heidegger, then a member of the Nazi Party, agreed to remove the dedication from &quot;Being and Time&quot; (restored in 1953 edition).

===Hermeneutics===

&quot;Being and Time&quot; employed the &quot;hermeneutic circle&quot; as a method of analysis or structure for ideas. According to Susann M. Laverty (2003), Heidegger&#x27;s circle moves from the parts of experience to the whole of experience and back and forth again and again to increase the depth of engagement and understanding. Laverty writes (Kvale 1996), &quot;This spiraling through a hermeneutic circle ends when one has reached a place of sensible meaning, free of inner contradictions, for the moment.&quot;

The hermeneutic circle and certain theories concerning history in &quot;Being and Time&quot; are acknowledged within the text to rely on the writings of Wilhelm Dilthey. The technique was later employed in the writings of Jürgen Habermas, per &quot;Influence and reception&quot; below.

===Destructuring===

In &quot;Being and Time&quot; Heidegger briefly refutes the philosophy of René Descartes (in an exercise he called &quot;destructuring&quot;), but the second volume, intended as a &quot;Destruktion&quot; of Western philosophy, was never written. Heidegger sought to explain how theoretical knowledge came to be seen, incorrectly in his view, as fundamental to being. This explanation takes the form of a destructuring (&quot;Destruktion&quot;) of the philosophical tradition, an interpretative strategy that reveals the fundamental experience of being hidden within the theoretical attitude of the metaphysics of presence.

In later works, while becoming less systematic and more obscure than in &quot;Being and Time&quot;, Heidegger turns to the exegesis of historical texts, especially those of Presocratic philosophers, but also of Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Plato, Nietzsche, and Hölderlin, among others.

==Influence and reception==
Upon its publication, reviewers credited Heidegger with &quot;brilliance&quot; and &quot;genius&quot;. The book was later seen as the &quot;most influential version of existential philosophy.&quot; 
Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s existentialism (of 1943) has been described as merely &quot;a version of &quot;Being and Time&quot;&quot;. The work also influenced other philosophers of Sartre&#x27;s generation, and exerted a notable influence on French philosophy.

Heidegger&#x27;s work influenced the output of the Frankfurt School including Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s hermeneutics and Herbert Marcuse&#x27;s early and abortive attempt to develop &quot;Heideggerian Marxism.&quot; Theodore Adorno, in his 1964 book &quot;The Jargon of Authenticity,&quot; was critical of Heidegger&#x27;s popularity in post-war Western Europe. Adorno accused Heidegger of evading ethical judgment by disingenuously presenting &quot;authenticity&quot; as a value-free, technical term rather than a positive doctrine of the good life.
Heidegger influenced psychoanalysis through Jacques Lacan as well as Medard Boss and others. Paul Celan, in his essays on poetic theory, incorporated some of Heidegger&#x27;s ideas. &quot;Being and Time&quot; also separately influenced Alain Badiou&#x27;s work &quot;Being and Event&quot; (1988), and also separately the enactivist approach to cognition theory.

Bertrand Russell was dismissive of &quot;Being and Time&quot; (&quot;One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot&quot;), and the analytic philosopher A. J. Ayer outright called Heidegger a charlatan. But the American philosopher Richard Rorty ranked Heidegger among the important philosophers of the twentieth century, including John Dewey and Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
The conservative British writer Roger Scruton called (2002) &quot;Being and Time&quot; a &quot;description of a private spiritual journey&quot; rather than genuine philosophy. But Stephen Houlgate (1999) compares Heidegger&#x27;s achievements in &quot;Being and Time&quot; to those of Kant and Hegel. Simon Critchley (2009) writes that it is impossible to understand developments in continental philosophy after Heidegger without understanding &quot;Being and Time&quot;.

==Related work==
&quot;Being and Time&quot; is the major achievement of Heidegger&#x27;s early career, but he produced other important works during this period:
*The publication in 1992 of the early lecture course, &quot;Platon: Sophistes&quot; (Plato&#x27;s Sophist, 1924), made clear the way in which Heidegger&#x27;s reading of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; was crucial to the formulation of the thought expressed in &quot;Being and Time&quot;.
*The lecture course, &quot;Prolegomena zur Geschichte des Zeitbegriffs&quot; (History of the Concept of Time: Prolegomena, 1925), was something like an early version of &quot;Being and Time&quot;.
*The lecture courses immediately following the publication of &quot;Being and Time&quot;, such as &quot;Die Grundprobleme der Phänomenologie&quot; (The Basic Problems of Phenomenology, 1927), and &quot;Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik&quot; (Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, 1929), elaborated some elements of the destruction of metaphysics which Heidegger intended to pursue in the unwritten second part of &quot;Being and Time&quot;.

Although Heidegger did not complete the project outlined in &quot;Being and Time&quot;, later works explicitly addressed the themes and concepts of &quot;Being and Time&quot;. Most important among the works which do so are the following:
*Heidegger&#x27;s inaugural lecture upon his return to Freiburg, &quot;Was ist Metaphysik?&quot; (What Is Metaphysics?, 1929), was an important and influential clarification of what Heidegger meant by being, non-being, and nothingness.
*&quot;Einführung in die Metaphysik&quot; (An Introduction to Metaphysics), a lecture course delivered in 1935, is identified by Heidegger, in his preface to the seventh German edition of &quot;Being and Time&quot;, as relevant to the concerns which the second half of the book would have addressed.
*&quot;Beiträge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis)&quot; (Contributions to Philosophy [From Enowning], composed 1936–38, published 1989), a sustained attempt at reckoning with the legacy of &quot;Being and Time&quot;.
*&quot;Zeit und Sein&quot; (Time and Being), a lecture delivered at the University of Freiburg on January 31, 1962. This was Heidegger&#x27;s most direct confrontation with &quot;Being and Time&quot;. It was followed by a seminar on the lecture, which took place at Todtnauberg on September 11–13, 1962, a summary of which was written by Alfred Guzzoni. Both the lecture and the summary of the seminar are included in &quot;Zur Sache des Denkens&quot; (1969; translated as On Time and Being [New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1972]).

<doc id="752534" wikidata="Q2505705" url="?curid=752534" title="Speaker of the Senate of Canada">
<text>The speaker of the Senate of Canada () is the presiding officer of the Senate of Canada. The speaker represents the Senate at official functions, rules on questions of parliamentary procedure and parliamentary privilege, and presides over debates and voting in the chamber. The office of the speaker is held by Raymonde Gagné who has held the position since May 16, 2023.

== Appointment and precedence ==

By convention, the speaker of the Senate is appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister.

The speaker of the Senate takes precedence only after the monarch, the governor general, members of the Canadian Royal Family, former governors general and their spouses, the prime minister, former prime ministers, and the chief justice of Canada in the Canadian Order of Precedence.

== History of the speaker ==

The role of the speaker in the Senate was originally based on that of the lord chancellor in the United Kingdom, who presided over the British House of Lords. In keeping with the role of the lord chancellor, the speaker of the Senate was expected to be partisan; the speaker of the Senate would, at all times, have the right to leave the chair, to participate in debates, and to hold an original vote—unlike the speaker of the House of Commons, who has a vote only in the event of a tie.

The speaker of the Senate was also similar to the lord chancellor in being considered equal to other senators. Decisions of the chair were not binding on the Senate unless the speaker&#x27;s decision was also the pleasure of a majority of senators. Also similar to the practice of the House of Lords was that the speaker would not intervene unless another senator brought a matter to the attention of the speaker. Decisions from the chair remain subject to appeals from the Senate.

Canada has more recently departed from the traditions of the House of Lords, notably since 1991, when new rules for the Senate were adopted. The new Standing Orders have made it clear that the speaker of the Senate &quot;could&quot; intervene without being called to do so by the Senate. The new guidelines move the Senate further from the model of the self-governing practices of the House of Lords, and more toward the chair-governed customs of the House of Commons.

The position was preceded by the speaker of the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada.

== Role of the speaker ==
The speaker of the Senate is historically responsible for deciding on points of order, only once risen by another senator. However, with the 1991 amendments to the Standing Orders and Guidelines that govern the Senate of Canada, the speakership has generally begun to assert its right to intervene, where appropriate, without being prompted to do so. Therefore, the speaker is, broadly speaking, responsible for the maintenance of order and decorum in the Senate.

As a high-ranking individual on the order of precedence, the speaker of the Senate often receives visiting heads of state and heads of government — this role is not merely ceremonial; the speaker is a real delegate and representative of Canada abroad. They are expected to represent Canada internationally, and sometimes visit other nations on behalf of the Government of Canada.

While the speaker is an officer of the Senate, the speaker as a senator also remains a representative of the province or territory from which they were appointed. Unlike the speaker of the House of Commons, the speaker of the Senate has the right to participate in debates. The speaker has the right and power to cast an original vote, and to simultaneously preside over the voting process (rather than the speaker merely delivering a tie-breaking vote).

Another significant difference between the two speakers is that the speaker of the House of Commons holds a management role within the administration of the House of Commons and chairs the Board of Internal Economy. The speaker of the Senate holds no similar role, as the Senate&#x27;s Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets, and Administration is chaired by another senator.

In the absence of the speaker in the chamber, their duties are carried by the speaker pro tempore, a senator appointed at the beginning of each session by the Senate. Should both chair officers be absent, any senator can be called upon to take the chair. Irrespective of who is in the chair, their decisions hold the same force as that of the speaker of the Senate.

== Ceremony ==
The speaker of the Senate performs the Senate Speaker&#x27;s Parade to mark the opening of a sitting in the Senate with the help of the Black Rod.

== List of speakers of the Senate ==
Key:


Hays, Housakos, and Furey are the only current living former speakers of the Senate.

Several speakers have died during their time in office:

* Josiah Burr Plumb, 1888
* Hewitt Bostock, 1930
* Georges Parent, 1942
* Pierre Claude Nolin, 2015

<doc id="752544" wikidata="Q17675706" url="?curid=752544" title="Civil Aeronautics Board">
<text>The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) was an agency of the federal government of the United States, formed in 1940 from a split of the Civil Aeronautics Authority and abolished in 1985, that regulated aviation services (including scheduled passenger airline service) and, until the establishment of the National Transportation Safety Board in 1967, conducted air accident investigations. The agency was headquartered in Washington, D.C.

==Powers==
The authority of the Civil Aeronautics Board to regulate airlines was established by the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. The 1938 Act was amended by the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, but the main effect of that was to establish the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA), which among other things regulated (as it still does) airline operations and safety. The 1966 Department of Transportation Act, which established the US Department of Transportation (DOT), had a bigger impact on the CAB. The 1966 Act established the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of DOT, which absorbed the CAB safety function, which was to investigate most airline accidents. Unlike the FAA, which (renamed as the Federal Aviation Administration) became part of DOT in the 1966 Act, the CAB remained an independent government agency.

While CAB regulation suppressed free competition, it provided security for the existing airlines, avoided gluts and shortages of passengers on certain routes, and (partly by allowing airlines to carry air mail) secured airline service for communities that would have otherwise been served less, or not have been served at all (due to low passenger traffic or other reasons).

CAB authority included:

* Entry Companies could not enter the airline industry, either for domestic or foreign (between the US and foreign points) routes unless certificated by the Board. The Act stated: &quot;No air carrier shall engage in any air transportation unless there is in force a certificate issued by the Board authorizing such air carrier to engage in such transportation.&quot; However, as described below, the Board also had the ability to provide exemptions from this and other Act requirements. The Board, when issuing a certificate, was required to determine a carrier was &quot;fit, willing and able&quot; to provide air transportation, that it would obey the Board and Act, and that the certificate issuance was required by &quot;public necessity and convenience&quot;. Further, the Board had to specify for each certificate the end and intermediate points of all routes. Thus the CAB not only determined entry into the industry, but also the specific routes a carrier served. It could also put limitations on that service. For instance, the CAB could approve a route from A to B to C but not allow the carrier to fly nonstop from A to C.
* Exit An airline could not leave a market without CAB approval.
* Fares The CAB had broad authority to set or limit fares. There was a fairly uniform national fare structure based on distance flown set by the CAB. In particular, carriers serving the same markets were held to the same fares, so competition on the basis of fares did not exist, other than in the final years of the CAB when it experimented with liberalization. Fares also tended to underprice short-haul markets and overprice longer-haul markets.
* Mergers The CAB had the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, not only between airlines, but between an airline and any other common carrier (e.g. a bus line or a railroad) or a company engaged in any other phase of aviation (like an aircraft manufacturer). Moreover &quot;merger&quot; was defined broadly, encompassing more general concepts of common control.
* Interlocking relationships Any interlocking relationship, such as common directors, between airlines, or between an airline and a common carrier, or a company in any other phase of aviation, required CAB approval.
* Inter-carrier agreement All agreements between carriers had to be filed with the CAB, which evaluated whether such agreements were in the public interest. If not, they were not approved. In 1970, the CAB reviewed over 1000 such agreements, many of a routine nature such as the cooperation of airlines at a particular airport. This could also work, on occasion, to shield airlines from anti-trust laws.
* Unfair competition and Misleading business practices. The Act authorized the Board to investigate and correct such behavior.
* Subsidy The Board was authorized to subsidize carriers. As shown below, in 1978 the CAB paid subsidies to a dozen carriers, including nine that flew jet equipment.
* Exemption The Board had broad authority to provide exemptions from provisions of the Act. For example, originally all US non-scheduled carriers were authorized this way, the Board simply exempting them from certification. As discussed below, in 1952, the CAB also simply carved out a blanket exemption for airlines flying &quot;small&quot; aircraft in scheduled service (thereby birthing the commuter airline business).

Airlines had no ability to make competitive decisions, absent CAB approval, on choice of route or fare charged on any particular route.

===Not included===

The Act also prevented the CAB from regulating certain things: frequency, equipment, accommodations and facilities. It was up to the carrier to determine what aircraft it flew and how often and what airport or ticket facilities it built/rented, and so forth. However, the CAB did generally require a minimum adequate service, e.g. often two flights/day, in a market.

==History==
The Civil Aeronautics Authority Act of 1938 superseded the Watres Act, which had regulated commercial aviation since the mid-1920s, and created a new agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The agency was renamed in 1940, due to a merger with the Air Safety Board. It became an independent agency under Reorganization Plans Nos. III and IV of 1940, effective on June 30, 1940. The Air Safety Board had formed in 1938.

Other predecessor agencies included the Aeronautics Branch (1926–1934), the Bureau of Air Commerce (1934–1938), and the Bureau of Air Mail, Interstate Commerce Commission (1934–38).

The first air accident investigation led by the CAB was the 1940 Lovettsville air disaster.

Some duties were transferred to the Federal Aviation Agency in 1958.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967, taking over air accident investigation duties.

===Deregulation===
In 1975, Senator Ted Kennedy, in his capacity as Chair of the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, assisted by Stephen Breyer, then a counsel to the judiciary committee (and later a Supreme Court Justice), held widely-reported hearings on the CAB. These hearings were later seen as the beginning of the process which ended in airline deregulation by the end of 1978. These publicized, among much else, the success that carriers like Southwest Airlines and Pacific Southwest Airlines had as intrastate airlines in Texas and California, despite the much lower fares they charged, and the degree to which the CAB acted primarily in the interests of the airlines, rather than consumers (the CAB chair until 1974, Robert D. Timm, prioritized ensuring scheduled airlines made a 12% return on investment and was caught accepting a Bermuda golf vacation from those airlines—Kennedy&#x27;s subcommittee referred Timm to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.) Links to the transcripts of those hearings, the associated evidence and exhibits, and the report that Kennedy and Breyer wrote, are in External links below.

Also in 1975, President Ford appointed John E. Robson as CAB Chair. Under the chairmanship of John Robson, the Civil Aeronautics Board &quot;in April 1976 did the unthinkable, becoming the first regulatory body to support deregulation,&quot; which President Gerald Ford first spurred in February 1975 with a proposal to abolish the CAB altogether. Robson was followed as CAB Chair by Cornell University professor Alfred E. Kahn, appointed by President Jimmy Carter. Kahn was a well-known specialist in regulatory economics, having written one of the standard texts and had previously been chairman of the New York Public Service Commission, the body regulating utilities in New York State. The CAB continued to be a focus of the early deregulation movement, and its dissolution was one of the most conspicuous pioneering event of that movement. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 specified that the CAB would eventually be disestablished — the first federal regulatory regime, since the 1930s, to be totally dismantled — and this happened on January 1, 1985. The remaining tasks were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation except for a few going to the U.S. Postal Service.

==Airlines not regulated by the CAB==
The CAB regulated almost all commercial air transportation in the US, but there were some exceptions.

===Air taxis===

The CAB chose not to regulate airlines flying &quot;small aircraft&quot;. This was formalized in Part 298 of the Board&#x27;s economic regulations, which in 1952 gave a blanket authorization for any airline operating an aircraft with a maximum gross takeoff weight of 12,500 lbs or less. Such airlines were originally known as &quot;air taxis&quot;, later as commuter airlines or Part 298 carriers. Confusingly, &quot;air taxi&quot; was also the term by which the CAB referred to Aspen Airways and Wright Air Lines (after they became certificated carriers) within the CAB&#x27;s taxonomy of certificated scheduled airlines (see &quot;Airline categories&quot; below). However, in 1972 the CAB expanded this category to include aircraft of 30 passengers or fewer, with a payload of less than 7,500 lbs. Such carriers did have to obtain Federal Aviation Administration operational/safety certification but were otherwise able to fly wherever they pleased.

The CAB would, on occasion, also exempt air-taxi or commuter operators to operate aircraft larger than the limits. For instance, in 1971, it exempted Executive Airlines and Air New England (at that time a commuter carrier) to fly propeller aircraft up to 44 seats to expand service in New England.

On five occasions, the CAB certificated former air taxi/commuter airlines to fly larger aircraft. These airlines were then regulated by the CAB like any other CAB carrier:
* Aspen Airways in 1967
* TAG Airlines in 1969
* Wright Air Lines in 1972
* Air New England in 1974
* Air Midwest in 1976
===Intrastate airlines===

An airline that restricted flying to within one state and took other steps to minimize participation in interstate commerce could avoid CAB regulation and fly as an intrastate airline. In the case of air taxis, the CAB chose not to regulate. In the case of intrastate airlines, it was legally unable to. Restriction of flying to a single state was not sufficient to avoid CAB regulation; the additional measures to avoid interstate commerce were critical. Furthermore, flying within a single state was generally interpreted strictly. An aircraft flying outside the boundaries of that one state could trigger CAB authority, including, in the case of Hawaii, flying overwater between the islands, which was upheld in court as being intrinsically interstate commerce because the Federal government had domain over the seas.

Note that the Federal government, while not providing economic regulation over intrastate carriers, did regulate them from an operational/safety standpoint. For those purposes intrastate airlines were regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration just like any other carrier.

===Uncertificated carriers===
Uncertificated carriers, known by a variety of names over time, such as contract carriers or Part 45 carriers, were airlines which escaped CAB regulation by not being common carriers - in other words, they did not hold themselves out to the public as a carrier. Zantop Air Transport was an example of such a company, flying aircraft on behalf of the US automakers on a private basis (before it acquired a supplemental certificate in 1962). &quot;Part 45&quot; was a reference to the then Civil Aviation Regulations under which the then Federal Aviation Agency regulated the operations/safety of such non-common carrier operators.

Over time, the Civil Aviation Regulations (subsequently the Federal Aviation Regulations) changed. Instead of Part 45, such uncertificated carriers were moved to being regulated under Part 42. They then became known as Part 42 carriers. Finally, the regulations were completely revamped, with most commercial operations moved to Part 121. Such operators were then known as Part 121 commercial operators or simply just commercial operators. A prominent example of such a carrier was Zantop International Airlines (ZIA), which started in 1972 as a Part 121 commercial operator, uncertificated by the CAB.

The CAB regularly enforced its powers against uncertificated carriers engaged in activities the CAB saw as making them common carriers. For instance, in February 1961, the issued a cease-and-desist order to, among others, Trans Global Airlines, Inc. aka Golden State Airlines, a Part 45 carrier, for carrying passengers to the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas for &quot;free&quot;. The fact that transportation was provided as part of the cost of accommodation did not make the airline any less a common carrier, and therefore guilty of providing interstate air transportation without a CAB certificate. The results of such investigations were not necessarily a foregone conclusion. In 1976, the CAB ended a long investigation by deciding ZIA was, in fact, not a common carrier (and thus did not require certification), going against the decision of its own administrative law judge. Ironically, this happened only a year before ZIA separately applied for and received certification as a supplemental air carrier.

===Air travel clubs===

Air travel clubs were membership organizations, nominally private, that had their own aircraft and ran trips for members. In 1968, the FAA instituted Part 123 of the Federal Aviation Regulations under which air travel clubs had their own operational requirements. Starting in the early 1970s, the CAB went after some of the largest air travel clubs for being de-facto common carriers. In 1973, it shut down Voyager 1000, a large Indiana-based air travel club. Voyager, which had a fleet comprising a Boeing 720, two Lockheed Electras and some piston aircraft and its own terminal at Indianapolis Airport, unsuccessfully appealed to the federal courts. The chief pilot of Voyager was George Mikelsons, who left to found what later became ATA Airlines. The CAB went on to shut two other large clubs in 1974 and 1975. Notwithstanding these enforcement actions, in November 1979 (within the first year of deregulation) there were still 11 air travel clubs operationally regulated under Part 123, though by May 1980 it had dropped to seven.

==Airline categories==
The CAB divided the airlines it regulated into categories according to the roles they were meant to play. The following draws from the CAB&#x27;s FY 1977 Report to Congress dated May 1978, and so reflects the state of CAB airline certification just prior to deregulation.

===Supplemental air carrier===
Until 1978 the CAB referred to charter carriers as supplemental air carriers. Prior to 1955, the CAB called them irregular air carriers, and prior to 1946 they were known as nonscheduled air carriers or nonskeds. These airlines sprang into existence, over 150 of them, at the end of World War II, using a loophole that was meant to be used by small businesses, like fixed base operators, to offer occasional small-aircraft charters without needing to get CAB approval.

From 1964, these airlines were simply charter carriers, but until 1964 they also had limited but flexible ability to fly scheduled service, which explains why they were not simply called charter carriers. Most of them failed to survive the regulated era, as the table below shows, unlike the scheduled carriers, which generally had the support of the CAB. At times the supplementals operated on the edge of legality—the CAB spent much of the 1950s trying to shut down a number that blatantly violated CAB regulations and the law. Supplementals also played a substantial role in the development of the first freight airlines—all of the first scheduled US freight airlines (like Flying Tiger Lines) started as irregular or supplemental air carriers.


===International air carrier===

Scheduled carriers were split between domestic and international. Two carriers were exclusively international: Air Micronesia (a subsidiary of Continental Airlines) and cargo carrier Seaboard. One carrier was almost exclusively international: Pan Am and, until deregulation, was not permitted to sell tickets for transport within the continental US. While it could fly aircraft from, say, New York to Los Angeles, it could not sell tickets between New York and Los Angeles despite having significant international operations in both cities. All other international carriers were also domestic carriers. There was a split within international between passenger airlines (which were always free to carry cargo and sometimes flew pure cargo aircraft) and cargo airlines.

===Trunk carrier===

Domestic had many subcategories. The original CAB scheduled carriers were known as trunkline carriers, trunklines, trunk airlines or simply just trunks, with most (but not all) such carriers having certificates dating back to 1938, the date of the Civil Aeronautics Authority Act that created the CAB. These were carriers such as United Air Lines, American, TWA, etc, all with origins going back to the 1920s and 1930s. For a summary, see the table below.

===Local service carrier===

After World War II, the CAB certificated a second set of scheduled carriers, the local service carriers. In theory, local service airlines served smaller routes than the trunklines, though most trunklines tended to have some legacy points on their networks that were quite small. Over time, the CAB allowed local service carriers to compete on some routes with trunklines and some local service carriers became sizeable airlines. However, as shown in the table below, in 1978, just prior to deregulation, the largest local service carrier Allegheny (soon to rename itself USAir) was still smaller in revenue terms than the smallest trunk, National, and basic operating statistics show the local service carriers as flying distinctly less capacity, smaller aircraft and shorter routes than the trunks.

Local service carriers were also the biggest recipients of CAB subsidies, as shown below. In 1978, the CAB paid a total of $66.3 million in subsidies to airlines (over $275 million in 2024 dollars) of which $58.5 million was paid to local service carriers, equivalent to over 40% of local service carrier operating profits that year.

===Other domestic certificate categories===

Other CAB domestic categories included intra-Alaskan, Hawaiian, helicopter, regional, air taxi, and cargo. Historically there was a territorial category, superseded by Hawaiian and Intra-Alaskan after Hawaii and Alaska became states. Some carriers had more than one domestic status. For instance, Alaska Airlines was listed as both an Alaska carrier and a trunk, however, for the purposes of 1978 CAB statistics it was counted as an Alaska carrier.

===1978 CAB scheduled carriers===
The wide variety of carriers in the table below hints at problems with just one facet of CAB regulation. Tiny Alaskan back-country carriers like Munz Northern and Kodiak-Western were subject to the same kind of proceedings as huge airlines like United and American. 1975 certification proceedings for Munz Northern were memorialized in 32 pages of CAB reports, encompassing the deliberations of the (usually five but in this case four) member CAB board itself, plus the earlier deliberations of an administrative law judge in front of whom six people appeared, representing Munz and two other interested parties. At the time, Munz had six aircraft, each carrying 10 people or fewer. Further, Munz then had the same reporting requirement as carriers like United, all the usual reams of data that had to be sent to the CAB, for a carrier a tiny fraction of the size.

==Offices==
The agency had its headquarters in the Universal Building in Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. The agency had moved there by May 1959. Previously it had been headquartered in the Commerce Building (a.k.a. the Herbert C. Hoover Building), and its offices were in several buildings. After moving into the Universal Building, CAB leased space there. By 1968 the agency had acquired an additional approximately of space in the same building, resulting in additional rent expenses.

<text>Kevin Earl Federline, (born March 21, 1978), also known as K-Fed, is an American dancer, actor, and DJ. He is known for his two-year marriage to American singer Britney Spears and the public child custody battle that followed their divorce. In 2006, Federline released a debut album, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, which was panned by critics as one of the worst albums ever released. He has since made a number of television and film appearances, and also worked as a DJ.

== Early life ==
Kevin Earl Federline was born on March 21, 1978, in Fresno, California, to parents Mike and Julie (née Story), a car mechanic and former bank teller from Oregon, respectively. Federline&#x27;s parents divorced when he was eight years old; then he moved to Carson City, Nevada, with his mother, but returned to Fresno when he was 11, when he and his brother Chris moved to his father&#x27;s house. In the ninth grade, Federline dropped out of high school (later earning a certificate of General Educational Development), and delivered pizzas for work.

== Career ==

=== 1996–2004: Early career as a dancer ===
In 1996, Federline moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in dance and began dancing with a nonprofit organization called Dance Empowerment. Federline lived in a one-bedroom apartment with six roommates. For a number of years, Federline worked as a backup dancer for Michael Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Pink, and LFO. He appeared as a Dirt Track Dancer in two episodes of the television sitcom &quot;Nikki&quot; (2001–2002) and as a dancer on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; (2001). He also had an uncredited role as an Angel Dancer for Cher on the sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (2002). He appeared as a dancer in a commercial for department store chain Target.

Federline has appeared in several music videos as a dancer, including Christina Milian&#x27;s &quot;AM to PM&quot; (2001), Pink&#x27;s &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; (2001) and Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Like I Love You&quot; (2002). He also appeared as a dancer in the dance drama film &quot;You Got Served&quot; (2004). Federline has said that dancers often don&#x27;t get enough credit for their work, telling &quot;People&quot; magazine: &quot;There&#x27;s nobody that gets less credit than somebody dancing.&quot;

=== 2005–2009: Wrestling and musical debut ===
Federline and his then-wife Britney Spears starred in UPN&#x27;s reality television series &quot;Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic&quot; (2005), which consisted of their home videos. The series chronicles the couple&#x27;s relationship from their courtship, engagement and wedding. He was nominated for a Choice TV: Male Reality/Variety Star award for his role on &quot;Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic&quot; at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards. He portrayed a hunter in a commercial for Britney Spears&#x27;s fragrance &quot;Fantasy&quot;. Federline appeared on the cover and a 12-page shoot for &quot;L&#x27;uomo Vogue&quot;, an Italian version of &quot;Men&#x27;s Vogue&quot;, shot by Steven Meisel. He subsequently guest-starred as Cole &quot;Pig&quot; Tritt, an arrogant teenager who harasses investigators on a job, in an episode of &quot;&quot; (2006). He also appeared on NBC&#x27;s game show &quot;1 vs. 100&quot; (2006), along with the cast of &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. In June 2006, he teamed up with Richard Branson to launch a &quot;Pennies for a Purpose&quot; campaign, which aimed to save the U.S. penny from annihilation.

Federline initially released a download-only song, &quot;Y&#x27;all Ain&#x27;t Ready&quot;, and a physical single, &quot;PopoZão&quot; in 2006, shortly after his marriage to Spears. Following poor critical reaction, neither song was included on his debut album. Instead, the first official single was &quot;Lose Control&quot;, which he premiered on the Teen Choice Awards show on the Fox network in late summer 2006. He released his debut album, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, on October 31, 2006, with the album being panned by critics. Federline has been signed to model for the Five Star Vintage line by the San Francisco-based Blue Marlin clothing company. The initial series of ads ran in August 2006 and was subsequently extended for Christmas 2006. The line he modeled for the fall 2006 was the top-selling line in Macy&#x27;s, Kitson, and Lord &amp; Taylor.

Federline appeared on WWE programming to promote his album, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, and participate in an angle. He first appeared on the October 16, and October 23, 2006, editions of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, in which he got into physical altercations with WWE Champion John Cena. The following week, he came to the ring to aid Johnny Nitro in his match against John Cena. After Cena got in Federline&#x27;s face, Federline slapped him hard. Federline appeared again during the November 5, 2006, pay-per-view event &quot;Cyber Sunday&quot;, hitting Cena with King Booker&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship belt and helping Booker win the Champion of Champions match that was organized between Cena, Booker, and Big Show. The next night, November 6, 2006, he challenged Cena to a match at the New Year&#x27;s Day edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, which Cena accepted. He went on to win this no-disqualification match thanks to interference from Johnny Nitro and Umaga. Later in the night, after John Cena&#x27;s main event match, Cena went after Federline and brought him into the ring and delivered his FU finishing move twice before cameras stopped rolling. According to the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;, Federline was well-received backstage. Sources say he worked so well with the company and personnel that the WWE may give him a regular role on the company&#x27;s show &quot;Raw&quot; in the near future. Other sources and wrestlers have spoken about Federline&#x27;s generally good attitude backstage as well.

Federline starred in a Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company commercial during Super Bowl XLI on February 4, 2007, as part of its &quot;Life Comes at You Fast&quot; ad series. In the commercial, Federline initially appeared in a music video, rapping about living a high-flying lifestyle. Then reality sets in as Federline is shown now working in a fast-food restaurant with his manager yelling at him, the punchline of the ad being &quot;Life comes at you fast&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that Federline was paid $377,000 for the commercial, and made $15,000 for appearing at his 29th birthday party at Pure nightclub in Las Vegas. He also earned $50,000 for a number of Las Vegas club appearances in December 2007. Federline appeared on the December 2007 cover of &quot;Details&quot; magazine, and he was named 7th most-influential man under 45, a spot he shared with Larry Birkhead. &quot;HuffPost&quot; reported three months later, that the December 2007 issue was on track to sell more than 75,000 copies, nearly 15,000 copies more than Federline&#x27;s March 2005 cover issue.

Federline guest-starred as Jason &quot;J-Fed&quot; Federline in three episodes of The CW&#x27;s television series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; (2008). He played Lollipop Love Dancer in &quot;The Onion Movie&quot; (2008), which was filmed in 2003, and a Canadian border guard in the comedy film &quot;American Pie Presents: The Book of Love (2009).&quot; In February 2009, he announced plans to start a children&#x27;s clothing line.

=== 2010–2022: Focus on DJing ===
In 2010, Federline appeared on the seventh season of VH1&#x27;s weight-loss reality television show &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;. He told &quot;Access Hollywood,&quot; that the reason for his weight gain was feeling depressed about his divorce from Spears and not feeling happy with himself. While appearing on the show, Federline lost 30 pounds. In November 2011, on a weight-loss show in Australia called &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; (2012), he was hospitalized for what was called &quot;heat stress&quot;. Filming was taking place in November which is the hottest time of the year in the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. On January 23, 2012, he suffered chest pains while filming the show.

On March 7, 2015, Federline worked as a DJ at Heat nightclub in Orange Country alongside DJ Prophet. He also hosts club events regularly with his wife Victoria Prince, such as a fantasy football event in 2015, with Federline saying: &quot;We take [fantasy football] so seriously that there are months of planning that go into the strategy of what your going to do with the other people. This is our 6th season. It&#x27;s been same people from the beginning. We have a waiting list to get into our league.&quot; He was featured as an ice sculpture in fast-food restaurant chain Jack in the Box&#x27;s television commercial in 2015. In April 2016, Federline released a music video for his new song, &quot;Hollywood&quot; with rapper Crichy Crich. Produced by Styles &amp; Complete, the song was inspired by &quot;the ridiculousness of Hollywood&quot;. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Vegas Seven&quot;, Federline said that he has been producing music for other artists. In 2018, he was a DJ at Three Wisemen club in Scottsdale, Arizona. He has also played DJ sets in Washington, Texas and California. In June 2019, Federline performed a DJ set at Harrah&#x27;s Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

In his first televised interview in over a decade, Federline and some of his family members appeared in a one-hour special interview on the Australian show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in September 2022. In the interview, Federline discussed his family life, saying: &quot;I want my sons to have the closest thing to a normal life that they can possibly have because it&#x27;ll make them better people. They see me, so they know that if they really want to get away they know how to get away.&quot;

== Personal life ==

=== Relationship with Shar Jackson ===
In 2000, Federline began dating actress and singer Shar Jackson. He was engaged to Jackson, with whom he has a daughter, Kori Madison Federline (b. July 31, 2002), and a son, Kaleb Michael Jackson Federline (b. July 20, 2004). The couple separated shortly before their son&#x27;s birth, as Federline ended things with Jackson for a relationship with pop singer Britney Spears. Jackson later commented that Federline&#x27;s relationship with Spears &quot;wasn&#x27;t like just breaking up a relationship. It was like breaking up a family&quot;, but the pair sustained an amicable relationship, with Jackson complimenting his parenting.

=== Marriage to Britney Spears ===
After three months of dating, Federline and Spears announced their engagement in July 2004; they were married on September 18 in a nondenominational ceremony at a residence in Studio City, California, but became legally valid on October 6. Due to the fact that Federline got into a relationship with Spears when his ex-girlfriend Shar Jackson was pregnant with Federline&#x27;s second child, the romance between Federline and Spears received intense attention from the media, with Federline being seen as a &quot;gold digger&quot;. The controversy of his breakup with Jackson, his relationship with Spears, the accusations of him being a &quot;gold digger&quot;, and the disparity in fame between him and Spears all made Federline both a frequent target of ridicule and an extremely disliked celebrity. Federline and Spears have two sons together.

On November 7, 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for both physical and legal custody of their two sons, with visitation rights for Federline. The following day, Federline filed a response to Spears&#x27; divorce petition, seeking physical and legal custody of their children. According to a representative for Federline&#x27;s lawyer, the divorce filing &quot;caught Kevin totally by surprise&quot;. On December 4, 2006, MSNBC reported that Federline set up a home for himself and his family in the Hollywood Hills. The pair reached a global settlement agreement in March 2007 and their divorce was finalized on July 30, 2007. Members of Spears&#x27; family have been photographed in and out of his home and babysitting the boys while Kevin was out of town.

On October 1, 2007, a court ruling granted Kevin Federline sole physical custody of his children, with legal custody to be decided. On the late evening of January 3, 2008, police were called to Spears&#x27; home after the singer reportedly refused to relinquish custody of her children to Federline (as told in Spears&#x27; memoir, because Federline was refusing to allow Spears to see her kids for lengthy periods and she feared that she wouldn&#x27;t see them again). Spears was taken from her home on a stretcher and hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. As a result of this, Federline was &quot;awarded sole legal custody and sole physical custody of the minor children&quot;.

On July 26, 2008, court papers were filed stating Federline would retain sole legal and physical custody of the children while Spears would get visitation rights that would increase over time. In addition to this, Federline would receive $20,000 per month from Spears in child support as well as additional funds to cover any custody-related legal expenses.

=== Marriage to Victoria Prince ===
Federline was first linked to former volleyball player Victoria Prince in 2008, when the two were both on the same recreational bowling team, the Party Animals. Their first daughter was born in 2011. They wed on August 10, 2013. Their second daughter was born in 2014. In the summer of 2023, the family moved to Hawaii, because Prince was offered a job at a Hawaii university. Prince played volleyball and graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2005.

<text>Irwin Corey (July 29, 1914 – February 6, 2017) was an American stand-up comic, film actor and activist, often billed as &quot;The World&#x27;s Foremost Authority&quot;. He introduced his unscripted, improvisational style of stand-up comedy at the San Francisco club the hungry i. Lenny Bruce described Corey as &quot;one of the most brilliant comedians of all time.&quot;

== Biography ==
Corey was born Irwin Eli Cohen to a Jewish family on , in Brooklyn, New York. Poverty-stricken after his father deserted the family, his mother was forced to place him and his five siblings in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum of New York, where Corey remained until his early teens. He then rode in boxcars out to California, and enrolled himself at Belmont High School in Los Angeles. During the Great Depression he worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps and, while working his way back East, became a featherweight Golden Gloves boxing champion.

Corey supported Communist/Socialist left-wing politics. He appeared in support of Cuban children, Mumia Abu-Jamal, and the American Communist Party, and was blacklisted in the 1950s, the effects of which he stated lingered throughout his life. (Corey never returned to &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; after his first appearance in 1982, which he claimed was a result of the blacklist still being in effect.) During the 1960 election, Corey campaigned for president on Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; ticket. During the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Corey endorsed Vermont United States Senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination and presidency. Corey was a frequent guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; hosted by Johnny Carson during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

When the publicity-shy Thomas Pynchon won the National Book Award Fiction Citation for &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in 1974, he asked Corey to accept it on his behalf. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the resulting speech as &quot;... a series of bad jokes and mangled syntax which left some people roaring with laughter and others perplexed.&quot;

In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Friday&quot;, the eponymous heroine says
At one time there really was a man known as &quot;the World&#x27;s Greatest Authority.&quot; I ran across him in trying to nail down one of the many silly questions that kept coming at me from odd sources. Like this: Set your terminal to &quot;Research.&quot; Punch parameters in succession &quot;North American culture,&quot; &quot;English-speaking,&quot; &quot;mid-twentieth century,&quot; &quot;comedians,&quot; &quot;the World&#x27;s Greatest Authority.&quot; The answer you can expect is &quot;Professor Irwin Corey.&quot; You&#x27;ll find his routines timeless humor.

== Career ==

=== Comedy ===
In 1938, Corey returned to New York, where he got a job writing and performing in &quot;Pins and Needles&quot;, a musical comedy revue about a union organizer in the &quot;garment district&quot;. He claimed that he was fired from this job for his union organizing activities. Five years later, he was working in &quot;New Faces of 1943&quot; and appearing at the Village Vanguard, doing his stand-up comedy routine. He was drafted during World War II, but was discharged after six months, after he claimed he convinced an Army psychiatrist that he was a homosexual.

From the late 1940s, Corey cultivated his &quot;Professor&quot; character. Dressed in seedy formal wear and sneakers, with his bushy hair sprouting in all directions, Corey would amble on stage in a preoccupied manner, then begin his monologue with &quot;However …&quot; He created a new style of double-talk comedy; instead of making up nonsense words like &quot;krelman&quot; and &quot;trilloweg&quot;, like double-talker Al Kelly, the Professor would season his speech with many long and florid, but authentic, words. The professor would then launch into observations about anything under the sun, but seldom actually making sense.

However … we all know that protocol takes precedence over procedure. 

This parliamentary point of order based on the state of inertia of developing a centrifugal force issued as a catalyst rather than as a catalytic agent, and hastens a change reaction and remains an indigenous brier to its inception. 

This is a focal point used as a tangent so the bile is excreted through the pancreas.

Changing topics suddenly, Corey would wander around the stage, pontificating all the while. His quick wit allowed him to hold his own against the most stubborn straight man, heckler or interviewer. One fan of Corey&#x27;s comedy, despite their radically different politics, was Ayn Rand. Theatre critic Kenneth Tynan wrote of the Professor in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Corey is a cultural clown, a parody of literacy, a travesty of all that our civilization holds dear, and one of the funniest grotesques in America. He is Chaplin&#x27;s tramp with a college education&quot;. Corey frequently appeared at the &quot;hungry i&quot; nightclub in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, and remained the favorite comedian of club owner Enrico Banducci. In 1980, Corey appeared with Banducci, Mort Sahl, Jonathan Winters, Bill Cosby, Jackie Vernon, and Maya Angelou in a tribute to the &quot;hungry i&quot; entitled &quot;hungry i Reunion&quot;, televised in 1981 on PBS.

In 1975, Corey gave a typically long-winded, nonsensical performance in New York City for journalists waiting for The Rolling Stones to announce the band&#x27;s 1975 tour of the Americas. The press was still listening to Corey ramble on when they finally noticed that the Stones were playing &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; on a flatbed truck driving down Fifth Avenue.

=== Broadway ===
In 1951, Corey appeared as &quot;Abou Ben Atom&quot;, the Genie, in the cult flop Broadway musical &quot;Flahooley&quot; along with Yma Sumac, the Bil and Cora Baird Marionettes, and Barbara Cook (in her Broadway debut). Corey&#x27;s performance of &quot;Springtime Cometh&quot; can be heard on the show&#x27;s original cast album. He also appeared in the Broadway play, &quot;Mrs. McThing,&quot; in 1952, with Helen Hayes, Jules Munshin and Brandon deWilde.

=== Film and television ===
Corey appeared occasionally in 1950s television as a character actor. He appeared in an episode of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; titled &quot;Bilko&#x27;s Grand Hotel&quot;, in which Corey plays an unkempt Bowery bum being passed off as a hotelier by Sgt. Bilko. The Professor was a frequent guest comic on variety shows and a guest panelist on game shows during the 1960s and 1970s.

Corey became so synonymous with comic erudition that in June 1977, when a Providence, Rhode Island television station, WJAR, wanted a spokesman to explain changes in network affiliations, Corey got the job. Lecturing with pointer in hand, Corey manipulated magnetic signs to demonstrate how television schedules would be disrupted. By the end of the commercial, the professor had wandered from his original point, and the magnetic field holding the visual aids in place was turned off, causing the set to collapse around Corey. He would do the same promos for WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee that same year, when rival stations WITI and WISN-TV switched affiliations.

Corey often appeared on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; (1962–1964), whereupon he would end his rambling stand-up routine with Allen and stagehands literally chasing Corey with a giant butterfly net. He later guest starred on &quot;The Donald O&#x27;Connor Show&quot; in 1968. Corey appeared in various Broadway productions, including as a gravedigger in a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

In 2009, filmmaker Jordan Stone began filming what was to become an award-winning documentary film called &quot;Irwin &amp; Fran&quot;. Political activist and fellow stand-up comedian Dick Gregory shared some in-depth and provocative memories and Academy Award-winning actress Susan Sarandon narrated in a very personal tone. The film won The People&#x27;s Film Festival Best Film Award in 2013.

== Personal life and death ==
Corey was married for 70 years to Frances Berman Corey, who died in May 2011. The couple had two children, Margaret Davis, née Corey, an actress, and Richard Corey, a painter. Their two grandsons are Amadeo Corey and Corey Meister. Irwin Corey turned 100 in July 2014.

For an interview in October 2011, the 97-year-old Corey invited a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter to visit his 1840 carriage house on East 36th Street. Corey estimated its resale value at $3.5 million. He said that, when not performing, he panhandled for change from motorists exiting the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, in exchange for cleaning their windshields with a squeegee. Every few months, he told the interviewer, he donated the money to a group that purchased medical supplies for Cuban children. He said of the drivers who supplied the cash, &quot;I don&#x27;t tell them where the money&#x27;s going, and I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t care.&quot; Irvin Arthur, Corey&#x27;s agent for half a century, assured the reporter that Corey did not need the money for himself. &quot;This is not about money,&quot; Arthur said. &quot;For Irwin, this is an extension of his performing.&quot; In his memoir, &quot;Phoning Home&quot;, Jacob M. Appel cites a personal encounter with Corey on a street in New York City as the basis for his novel, &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Stand Up&quot;.

Corey died at the age of 102 on February 6, 2017, at his apartment in Manhattan with his son, Richard, at his side.

<doc id="752559" wikidata="Q356792" url="?curid=752559" title="Frank Klepacki">
<text>Frank Klepacki (; ) is an American musician and video game composer, best known for his work on the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series. Having learned to play drums as a child, he joined Westwood Studios as a composer when he was 17 years old. He has scored several games there, including the &quot;Lands of Lore&quot; series, Westwood Studios&#x27; &quot;Dune&quot; games, &quot;The Legend of Kyrandia&quot; series, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series. His work in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot; won two awards.

He lives in Las Vegas, where he has shaped a solo career and played and produced for several local bands. His personal and band work touches upon several genres, including orchestral, rock music, hip hop music, soul music, and funk. He has dubbed the style of music he writes as &quot;Rocktronic&quot;. His work has appeared in various media, including the Spike TV program &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;.

Klepacki is currently the audio director of Petroglyph Games, where he scored &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot;. Klepacki was contacted to score &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot;, but was too busy with Petroglyph to take the project, and declined to mention the offer. Klepacki composed three songs for &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot; by EA Los Angeles. His solo CD entitled &quot;Viratia&quot; is packaged with a comic he helped produce.

== Early life and career ==
Klepacki was raised by a family of musicians of Polish and Italian descent who played on the Las Vegas strip. He drew art as a hobby, but music prevailed in his early interests. He received his first drumset at age 8 and began performing professionally by age 11. Among his early influences were electronica and heavy metal groups, including Depeche Mode, Afrika Bambaataa, AC/DC, and Iron Maiden. Seeking to master guitar, bass, and keyboards, he formed local bands and created a demo tape of original material by age 17. His impetus for diversifying his instrumental abilities was &quot;not being able to communicate with other band members on ideas...for original songs.&quot; His first piece of audio gear was a TASCAM 4-track cassette recorder, which he used to record demos, band practices, and live shows.

After learning to program BASIC on a Tandy 1000 and becoming interested in computer and video games, he applied for a job as a game tester at Westwood studios. He submitted his demo tape—described as &quot;an acoustic guitar song with electric guitar leads and keyboard strings, and raining sound effects&quot;—to the company&#x27;s audio director. The growing company enlisted him as a composer for the NES port of &quot;DragonStrike&quot; and the computer game &quot;Eye of the Beholder II&quot;. He later composed with MIDI sequencing for several other &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games. In 1992, he helmed the audio of &quot;Dune II&quot;, attempting to complement the music of the original &quot;Dune&quot;. He later noted that he pushed the sequencing program on his Amiga to the limit while scoring the game. While working on &quot;Disney&#x27;s The Lion King&quot; in 1994, he and the Westwood team were shown sketches of the unfinished feature film. Film composer Hans Zimmer later praised Klepacki for reworking his scores. After finishing the third entry into &quot;The Legend of Kyrandia&quot; series, &quot;Malcolm&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, Frank Klepacki met with Westwood leaders to discuss the upcoming game &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, the first in a series which would bring him wider fame and critical acclaim.

=== &quot;Command and Conquer&quot; series ===
In 1994, Klepacki met with Westwood Studios developers to discuss the soundtrack of the company&#x27;s next project&quot;, Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. To define the game&#x27;s style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands, including Nine Inch Nails and Ministry, which would supply the iconic industrial style found in the majority of the songs. He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company&#x27;s recent shift to 22 kHz audio, Klepacki composed with an Ensoniq ASR-10 sampler, a Roland S760 sampler, a Roland JD-990 synth module, and an electric guitar. The first few songs he composed for &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; contained voice samples, including the notable pieces &quot;Act on Instinct&quot; and &quot;No Mercy&quot; (which featured wild declarations from &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;). The samples were later found to interfere with the game&#x27;s spoken audio, and were replaced with versions lacking the voices, although the original versions (and several other unused pieces) can still be found on the DOS &quot;C&amp;C&quot; and &quot;Covert Operations&quot; discs. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game&#x27;s commercial soundtrack. He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career, using a quote from &quot;The Brain from Planet Arous&quot; in the &quot;Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot; track &quot;Brainfreeze&quot;, for example. Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, drawing influences from orchestral, house, heavy metal, and hip hop music. For the credits, Klepacki wrote &quot;Airstrike&quot;, featuring a hook later used in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun&quot; for the Global Defense Initiative. Conversely, the Brotherhood of Nod ending used the song &quot;Destructible Times&quot;, written by Klepacki&#x27;s local band, I AM. The developers requested the song because it &quot;reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of Nod&#x27;s side.&quot; The &quot;C&amp;C&quot; expansion pack &quot;The Covert Operations&quot; featured seven new ambient pieces, all of which were also included on the disc in high quality CD Audio format. Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.

While working on &quot;Covert Operations&quot;, Klepacki composed &quot;Hell March&quot;, from the idea of &quot;a rock tune to marching boots,&quot; finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff. Upon listening, director Brett Sperry insisted this song be used as the signature theme of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert&quot;. Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples—including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders. Klepacki initially scored &quot;Red Alert&quot; with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the &quot;Red Alert&quot; team to expand upon the style of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like &quot;Workmen&quot; and &quot;Crush&quot;, then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as &quot;Vector&quot; and &quot;Roll Out&quot;. Klepacki also composed &quot;Fogger&quot; and &quot;Mud&quot;, one of his personal favorites, before finishing with &quot;Militant Force&quot; and &quot;Radio 2&quot;. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by Kane and an Allied commander in the cut scenes of &quot;Red Alert&quot;. He previously appeared as a Nod soldier and the voice of the commando in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.

After completing &quot;Red Alert&quot;, he took a short break to review his work. He concluded that some songs could be enhanced, but &quot;Red Alert&quot; had already gone gold, precluding new versions. These remixes later appeared on the unsuccessful &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Sole Survivor&quot;. &quot;Red Alert&quot;″s soundtrack was voted best video game soundtrack of 1996 by &quot;PC Gamer&quot; and &quot;Gameslice &quot;magazines, defeating Trent Reznor&#x27;s score for &quot;Quake&quot;. Reviewers called it &quot;fun to listen to&quot; and &quot;second to none.&quot; As of 2005, &quot;Red Alert&quot; was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for selling several million units, bringing Klepacki his widest audience. He wrote additional music for the game&#x27;s expansion packs, &quot;Counterstrike&quot; and &quot;Aftermath&quot;. He attributed the success of &quot;Red Alert&quot; to an infusion of modern styles not found in other games. Klepacki initially wrote off the popularity of his music, assuming that his music &quot;must only appeal to die-hards.&quot; He considered it &quot;very surreal&quot; to realize his soundtracks had gained him fame, and has since embraced his fans and critics.

=== Later Westwood games ===
In 1997, Klepacki scored a &quot;Blade Runner&quot; adaptation. Though Westwood acquired the rights to use the original film score by Vangelis, the company was not allowed access to the original master recordings, and Klepacki had to recreate the themes by ear. Developers were satisfied by his attention to detail, feeling that his digital recreations sounded clearer than the originals. In 1998, Klepacki composed the soundtrack for &quot;Dune 2000&quot;. He attempted to update the music from &quot;Dune II&quot; into &quot;this non-blip stuff,&quot; and worked in homages to the original style of the films as composed by Toto. &quot;Dune 2000&quot; was panned by critics, though Klepacki&#x27;s score was praised for adhering to the traditional &quot;Dune&quot; style. Klepacki considered &quot;2000&quot; to be a more definitive work than &quot;Dune II&quot;, which was constrained by software and hardware limitations. He then composed the soundtrack for &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun&quot; with Jarrid Mendelson, with whom he would later collaborate on &quot;&quot;. He began by writing &quot;Stomp&quot;, an energetic rock piece intended to recreate the effect of &quot;Hell March&quot; for the new game. Coincidentally, one of the trailers for &quot;Command and Conquer 3&quot; featured &quot;Stomp&quot; as the soundtrack. Westwood instead wanted &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot; to feature darker, more moody music, and &quot;Stomp&quot; was shelved in favor of the current sound. Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction, Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best. &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot; ultimately featured dark, ambient techno music and ambient space music suited to the game&#x27;s post-apocalyptic and futuristic setting. Klepacki cited the piece &quot;Mad Rap&quot; as his favorite. An avid &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, he enjoyed scoring cut scenes featuring James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader. The scenes also allowed him to integrate the &quot;Airstrike&quot; and &quot;No Mercy&quot; themes into the game&#x27;s score, despite the aforementioned shift. With the expansion pack &quot;Firestorm&quot;, he attempted to &quot;set things right&quot; by writing more upbeat songs and including &quot;Stomp&quot;, which would also appear in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot;.

He next scored &quot;Lands of Lore III&quot; and &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2&quot;. Klepacki defined &quot;Red Alert 2&quot;″s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats. Klepacki scored the game with a Korg TR Rack, Novation Nova desktop, and Roland XV-5080. &quot;Red Alert 2&quot; included a remix of &quot;Hell March&quot;. The return to high-energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of &quot;Tiberian Sun&quot;. Klepacki maintained the energetic style in &quot;Red Alert 2&quot;″s expansion pack &quot;Yuri&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. For &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot;, the next entry in the series, Klepacki tried to update the style of the original &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; by making it &quot;hipper and more elaborate.&quot; Several &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; mainstays appear as reworked versions, including &quot;Target (Mechanical Man)&quot;, &quot;Industrial&quot;, &quot;Act on Instinct&quot; and &quot;No Mercy&quot;. The main theme&#x27;s melody comes from &quot;C&amp;C 80&#x27;s Mix&quot;, a piece composed for &quot;Covert Operations&quot;, but which was scrapped before release. Klepacki&#x27;s last contribution to Westwood Studios was the music of &quot;Earth &amp; Beyond&quot;, comprising four albums of material. Acquired by Electronic Arts in 1998, Westwood was liquidated in 2002 and the remaining employees were relocated to EA Los Angeles. Several Westwood founders left the company. Though Klepacki offered to score &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Generals&quot;, and submitted a demo to EA, he was not offered the job. When asked in 2002 whether he&#x27;d continue scoring music after ten years in the business, he exclaimed, &quot;ten down, next ten to go!&quot; After Westwood&#x27;s closure, he reflected on his past work at a dinner held by Joseph Kucan and other former employees.

=== Petroglyph Games ===
Klepacki took a brief hiatus to work on solo albums, then joined Petroglyph Games as full-time audio director in 2004. He prepared by becoming versed in the job&#x27;s requirements and demands. His first task was scoring &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot;, Petroglyph&#x27;s launch title; he also helped select voice actors. A die-hard fan of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, Klepacki enjoyed complementing John Williams&#x27;s style as he worked with sound effects used in the feature films. He worked closely with programmers to ensure perfect aural functionality. Though most of the game&#x27;s score is John Williams&#x27;s work, Klepacki estimates that he contributed 20% original material. Apart from the main theme, he aimed to minimize his editing in order to retain the classic &quot;Star Wars&quot; sound. He chiefly composed for new areas of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe only found in &quot;Empire at War&quot;. He calls his work on the game &quot;the peak of my career,&quot; and felt he had spent his entire life grooming his abilities for that soundtrack. As a perk of composing, he visited the Skywalker Ranch and Industrial Light and Magic, and took pride in having his name associated with an official &quot;Star Wars&quot; product.
For the &quot;Forces of Corruption&quot; expansion pack, he took greater creative liberty with the &quot;Star Wars&quot; feel by writing an original theme for the new criminal faction. In attempting to compose this piece, he wrote several preliminary hooks that were later integrated into the game&#x27;s battle themes. He composed six pieces for the expansion total, including the finale theme. In line with the criminal theme of the game, Klepacki borrowed motifs and recreated the mood from scenes involving Jabba the Hutt in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. His score for the expansion pack was accepted upon first submission to LucasArts. As Petroglyph&#x27;s audio director, he also selected sound effects, a tricky process due to the issue of making the criminal faction&#x27;s sounds a &quot;little different, without straying too much from the original signature sounds.&quot; Klepacki worked with LucasArts to select voice actors, and contributed his own talents to the role of IG-88 and other minor characters. A blooper reel of his voice acting was released on Petroglyph&#x27;s forums after the one-thousandth member registered. Klepacki was contacted to score &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3&quot;, but was too busy with duties at Petroglyph and declined to mention the offer publicly. Electronic Arts hired Steve Jablonsky to score the game instead; an EA community manager at &quot;C&amp;C 3&quot;″s forums suggested that the audio team studied Klepacki&#x27;s music and tried to recreate his style. Klepacki feels that &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; is a significant part of his life and that he would like to return to the &quot;Tiberian&quot; era. He conceded that employment at Petroglyph games would probably prevent him from working with Electronic Arts. Years later, in 2018, he would have that opportunity due to EA partnering with Petroglyph to remaster the games since many of the former developers from Westwood Studios had started, and continue to work at, Petroglyph.

Klepacki&#x27;s next project was a game collaboration by SEGA and Petroglyph named &quot;Universe at War: Earth Assault&quot;. As of December 2006, he had composed several songs for various factions and enjoyed the &quot;opportunity to create something new again, not based on...existing intellectual property. Klepacki &quot;began by taking into account what songs were identified as fan favorites in...past related work&quot;. He was interviewed about the creative process on 27 March 2007 by Kevin Yu, a Petroglyph community manager, and provided a detailed tour of his studio at the company. His office included one of the fastest computers at Petroglyph and a vocal booth where unit responses and other vocalizations were tested and tweaked before voice actors performed finishing work. Klepacki was glad that Universe of War did not demand strict obedience to a particular style. He declared that surprises were in store for &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; fans waiting for him to return to his &quot;roots&quot; and &quot;adrenaline-pumping soundtrack style&quot;, and suggested that they &quot;imagine my mindset...when &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; first came out, and add about fifteen years experience to that.&quot; Klepacki summarized the game&#x27;s main styles shortly before release:

As audio director, Klepacki also created many sound effects for &quot;Universe at War&quot;. For the alien Hierarchy, he cultivated an &quot;unnatural&quot; aesthetic through an &quot;arsenal of mangled noises&quot;. Klepacki used a &quot;combination of heavy cranes recorded with overdriven impacts&quot; to give the faction&#x27;s walkers a &quot;menacing machinelike breathing sound&quot;, and made up his own language to record &quot;various grunts, growls, mannerisms, and strange vocalizations. Since Hierarchy heroes needed to communicate to the player in English, Klepacki engineered dialogue to seem as if the aliens were &quot;telepathically speaking to you, with a back-masking effect on their voices...as if the words are being channeled straight to your brain&quot;. The Novus effects were usually phased and involved &quot;mechanical movement, electricity, and metal sounds&quot;. He invented yet another language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel, who occasionally speak to one another. Lastly, he drew on weather and other natural sounds for the Masari, describing their ambience as having &quot;more weight, thunder, heavy bass rumblings, vortex gusts...&quot; Klepacki directed the voice-acting to have a &quot;noble and strong&quot; feel without appearing typically medieval or overly dramatic. He ultimately felt he did the work of &quot;three people&quot; with &quot;Universe at War&quot;, as the game&#x27;s audio requirements changed constantly, requiring vigilance and programmer support. &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; was later nominated for a &quot;Game Audio Network Guild&quot; award, and the soundtrack was released as a free download after Petroglyph&#x27;s efforts toward a traditional release were frustrated.

Klepacki next composed three songs for &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot;, including &quot;The Red Menace&quot;, &quot;Grinder 2&quot;, and &quot;Hell March 3&quot;. &quot;Hell March 3&quot; was recorded with the aid of a four-piece rock band alongside the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and Choir at the Skywalker Sound scoring stage; the choir also sang in Russian for an updated version of &quot;Grinder&quot; from &quot;Red Alert 2&quot;. He remarked in 2008 that he would never grow tired of &quot;Hell March&quot;, and was thankful it had resonated with so many fans. Around this time, he composed using Cubase, Kontakt, a MOTU 2408 audio interface, and several instruments. Collaborating with Video Games Live, Klepacki performed &quot;Hell March&quot; and its &quot;Red Alert 2&quot; version in Las Vegas in 2008, and later performed &quot;Hell March 3&quot; in the Netherlands with a choir and orchestra through the &quot;Games in Concert&quot; series; he wore a Soviet army conscript uniform for the song.

=== Solo and band work ===

Klepacki has also played in and produced albums for several Las Vegas bands. I AM&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Home&quot; is his first full-length CD appearance. The band featured Greg Greer on vocals, Rod Arnett on bass, Dan Ryan on guitar, and Klepacki on drums. Formed from the rhythm section of local band &quot;Shatterbone&quot;, I AM released one album in 1995 and broke up. Described as alternative progressive rock, the band&#x27;s music drew influences from Tool and Soundgarden. The song &quot;Destructible Times&quot; was used for the Brotherhood of Nod ending in the original &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. After the break-up, Klepacki joined Home Cookin&#x27;, a ten-member ensemble which played funk and soul in the tradition of Tower of Power. Founded in 1989, Home Cookin&#x27; commercially debuted with &quot;Mmm, Mmm, Mmm,&quot; in 1997 (which featured a number one hit) and released a second album (&quot;Pink in the Middle&quot;) in 2000 before disbanding following a tour in California. Towards the end of its run, the band played at Quark&#x27;s Bar in Star Trek: The Experience and at the Boston Grill and Bar. The group sometimes opened shows with a four-member funk act named Junkfood. Home Cookin&#x27; was popular by readers of &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot;, winning several awards over its history—including &quot;Best Horns&quot; in a band. Klepacki boasted that turnout for the band at clubs was usually above four hundred people. In 2003, he formed The Bitters, a trio composed of Klepacki, bassist Vinny Moncada, and guitarist Jeff Murphy. With a style described as metal and jazz fusion, the group has released one album as of August 2006. Klepacki is also a member of the group Mo Friction, supported by former Home Cookin&#x27; members. Their debut album will mark Klepacki&#x27;s first outing as a band&#x27;s lead vocalist.

Klepacki&#x27;s solo work debuted in 2002 with &quot;Morphscape&quot;. Production began in 1996 with the song &quot;Cybertek&quot;, though an album was not planned at this time. The rest of &quot;Morphscape&quot;″s songs were composed after &quot;Red Alert 2&quot;. Klepacki composed the album&#x27;s title track while working on &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade&quot;, and feels the game&#x27;s style is visibly present in &quot;Morphscape&quot;. Klepacki released the final product after Westwood&#x27;s dissolution. His biggest inspiration in creating solo works is the legion of fans interested in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. Klepacki took a hiatus from composing video game music to write two other solo albums, the first of which is entitled &quot;Rocktronic&quot;. Released in 2004, the album was described as dark, edgy, and heavy in a way that will appeal to &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; fans. Klepacki sought out specific samples and instruments used in the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; soundtrack for use in the release; the title &quot;Rocktronic&quot; was an attempt to name his style of music. Featuring live drumming in certain songs, the album is Klepacki&#x27;s best-seller. Following &quot;Rocktronic&quot; was &quot;Virtual Control&quot;, released in 2005. Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album. Tracks from each release have been periodically used in &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot;, along with certain custom themes written for the show.

On 1 August 2006, he revealed his next solo project would be named &quot;Awakening of Aggression&quot; and confirmed the music would be &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;hard-hitting.&quot; When interviewed, Klepacki said that he channeled stress into the heavy music of the new album. &quot;Aggression&quot; was released in October of the same year, and was made available on iTunes on 7 December. He filled the liner notes of the album with the names of several supportive fans who had purchased his music. As of April 2007, he speculates that a new solo release will be ready by the end of the year. After establishing recognition on &quot;Ultimate Fighter&quot;, Klepacki began scoring themes for HDNet&#x27;s &quot;Inside the MMA&quot; and &quot;HDNet Fights&quot; in autumn 2007. Around this time, he made it to the district finals of the Guitar Center &quot;drum-off&quot; competition after winning two store challenges in Las Vegas but was eliminated. His solo album &quot;Infiltrator&quot; was released in April 2009. According to Klepacki, the album was inspired by his recent work on the &quot;Red Alert&quot; series. Klepacki enjoys Las Vegas thanks to its diversity of musical talent and prolific number of shows and attractions. He attributes his showmanship to being raised in the city, noting that one has to &quot;stand out&quot; to be noticed among the entertainment atmosphere of Vegas. The city&#x27;s &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot; honored him as a &quot;badass composer&quot; in its mid-April 2009 issue, highlighting his prolific fan-base and work as producer for various local bands.

== Work and beliefs ==
When composing for video games, Klepacki spends a few days to compose and master one song on average. He feels writing music for games is somewhat difficult as only early software builds are available to play; he sometimes must compose songs based on vague descriptions. Composing for cut scenes is easier by comparison, and Klepacki enjoys drawing inspiration and direction from game design art. Nonetheless, he prefers to compose for a game throughout its development rather than write songs for a finished product. He feels that game music has been harder to compose than film or solo music as he must compose for all situations a player may discover or engineer. Klepacki maintains templates with a base of common instruments prepared for sudden bursts of inspiration, as he resents &quot;having technical issues...as an obstacle.&quot; When asked how the composing process begins, Klepacki related:

Klepacki has said that the most rewarding part of composing video game music is working with a team—which he compares to chemistry between band members—and knowing he is part of a greater cause. He believes that game music could improve if artists focused on quality and derived inspiration from playing games. He has expressed interest in having Electronic Arts sell his soundtracks in retail stores, preferably next to video games in electronic departments. He advises those wishing to get in the video game business to attend conventions and investigate developer companies. He also noted in 2008 that &quot;composition and engineering skills are now required,&quot; advising upstart composers to ensure their work is film-quality. Klepacki is happy to see older games offered on the Wii, hoping that gamers are &quot;recognizing once again that simple, short fun experiences are just as good as...long, huge-production experiences.&quot; Klepacki listed several influences for his style of composition: &quot;John Williams naturally for my love of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and his style in general, Michael Kamen for his composing diversity, Metallica for sparking my metal influence, Vince Dicola who in my opinion is way under-rated for his great work, Sly &amp; The Family Stone for inspiring funk, syncopation, and positive energy, Larry Graham for inspiring me to play funk bass, Nine Inch Nails for their unique uses of mangled sound, and Rob Zombie for combining music with a theme and persona.&quot;
Klepacki runs a personal website featuring a biography, archived interviews, and a playlist of songs streamed in 128 kbit/s mp3. His music is also available from iTunes. As a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, he has extensively written about the film premieres of the last two prequels on his website. He maintains an account at YouTube and has posted three videos of his work with other bands. He is an ardent supporter of digital cinema, believing the medium to be the pinnacle of quality. He has scored two short films, and won a CineVegas award for his work with &quot;Unreel Invasion&quot;. Klepacki believes that the genre of video game music is more respected than it has ever been. He notes that complex and quality music comes at a higher cost, prompting certain producers to simply &quot;get somebody who could cop the Hollywood sound&quot; instead of nurturing original style. When asked about his career low-point, he named &quot;Order of the Griffon&quot; for the TurboGrafx-16, citing difficulties with the system&#x27;s limited musical capabilities. Concerning his solo career and Westwood, Klepacki regrets &quot;not having attended more of the fun company functions and parties while I was instead playing club gigs with bands with the mentality of trying to get signed or discovered.&quot; When asked to reflect on his career, he replied:

Klepacki is not seeking a record deal, citing a &quot;horrible chain of steps to getting famous.&quot; Scathingly critical of the recording industry, he blames MTV—described as a &quot;teenage reality show channel&quot;—for putting a pretty face on music and destroying the independent valuation of actual sound. Klepacki has declared pop music as having become the &quot;largest farce in music history—soul-less, mechanical, and only made for the sole purpose of making the fastest dollar possible, with more emphasis on imagery than the music.&quot; He&#x27;s also criticized lip-synching and the repackaging of music genre through different labels—such as Nu metal for rock music and Neo soul for soul music. He believes that signing a deal does not guarantee profits, and would rather keep his day job as audio director. These sentiments were echoed in a special feature on the band Home Cookin&#x27;; in 2000, Klepacki said the group wanted to &quot;work with a label, not for them.&quot; Stating that he would not compromise his work for popularity, he believes that &quot;the only artists that have any longevity are the ones that pioneer a movement—not follow one.&quot; He enjoys working independently, as he does not have to &quot;change...music for the sake of pop radio.&quot; He champions the internet as a medium through which creative and original artists can be found. Klepacki believes it is the preferred avenue for music when compared to radio airplay—where one hears &quot;the exact same songs 3 months at a time.&quot; When interviewed about file-sharing, he expressed mixed emotions. Holding that compact discs are &quot;just too damn expensive&quot;, Klepacki believes that a few dollars&#x27; reduction in price would &quot;deter people from downloading for free.&quot; Conversely, he notes that artists—who &quot;don&#x27;t get as much money as you think&quot;—need to be compensated for their work. His favorite artists by decade, starting with the 1960s, are Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station, Metallica, Home Cookin&#x27;, and Bob Schneider.

<doc id="752572" wikidata="Q1056769" url="?curid=752572" title="Colby cheese">
<text>Colby is a semihard orange cheese made from cow&#x27;s milk. It is named after the city of Colby, Wisconsin, USA, where it was first developed in 1885 and quickly became popular. Today the cheese is typically used in snacks, sandwiches, and salads.

Colby was developed by eliminating the cheddaring process used in making cheddar cheese, and instead partially draining the whey after the curd is cooked and adding cold water to decrease the mixture&#x27;s temperature; the result is a moister and softer cheese. Traditional &quot;washed-curd&quot; Colby is pressed into a cylindrical form called a longhorn, and cures into an open texture with irregular holes. 

Derivatives include Colby-Jack, a marble cheese produced by mixing Colby and Monterey Jack curds, and Pinconning cheese, a style of Colby that was developed in Michigan. The city of Colby considers the cheese an important part of its history, and organizes an annual festival to promote Colby cheese. Several proposals have been made in the Wisconsin state legislature to designate Colby the official state cheese.

==History==

In 1882, Ambrose and Susan Steinwand established a cheese factory near Colby, Wisconsin, on a site they had purchased five years before. The Steinwands&#x27; son Joseph developed the cheese at the factory in 1885 when he was handling a batch of cheddar cheese and washed the curd with cold water. Accounts differ on whether the creation was intentional. According to some sources, Joseph had attended a cheesemaking course and was specifically interested in developing a new type of cheese; according to others, he neglected to drain the excess moisture after adding cold water and accidentally discovered the result. The resulting cheese, which was moister than cheddar, was named after the nearby city and quickly became popular because it did not involve the complicated cheddaring process.

By 1896, the family was producing US$3000 () worth of cheese each year. In 1898, the &quot;Colby Phonograph&quot; reported that &quot;a merchant in Phillips gives as one of the 13 reasons why people should trade with him, that he sells the genuine Steinwand Colby Cheese.&quot; The city of Colby has organized an annual festival in July, &quot;Colby Cheese Days&quot;, to promote the cheese since 1965. That same year, Lawrence Hoernke built a new Colby Cheese Factory on the site of the Steinwands&#x27; original factory; it produced about of Colby a day until it shut down in 1983.

Several proposals have been put forth to make Colby the official state cheese of Wisconsin and to add the designation to the &quot;Wisconsin Blue Book&quot; published by the state government. In 1998, the city of Colby adopted a resolution supporting the measure and the Wisconsin State Assembly voted 81–15 in support, but the bill was not voted on by the Senate. A similar measure was introduced in 2019, but did not receive a vote in either the Assembly or the Senate. In 2021, the bill was introduced again in an Assembly committee, with Joseph Steinwand&#x27;s great-granddaughter speaking in support of the measure. Supporters of the bill said that it commemorates Wisconsin&#x27;s dairy history, while critics argued that a special designation for Colby could undermine the sales of other cheeses, including cheddar and mozzarella, that are also produced in the state.

==Production==

The manufacturing process for Colby is similar to that of cheddar cheese, except that the mixture does not go through the cheddaring process. Cow&#x27;s milk that has been standardized to a protein–fat ratio of 0.96 undergoes pasteurization and is stored at while the starter &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; (subspecies &quot;lactis&quot; and/or &quot;cremoris&quot;) is added. After an hour, of annatto, a coloring agent, and of diluted rennet are added per of milk. The mixture is left to set for 15 to 30 minutes. The curd is then cut and cooked at until the pH of the whey is about 6.2 to 6.3.

Next, instead of draining all of the whey and cheddaring the remaining curds, only about two-thirds of the whey is drained until the curds break the surface. Cold water is added until the temperature of the mixture is about ; increasing this temperature slightly produces a cheese that is less moist. After washing with the cold water for 15 minutes, the mixture is fully drained and salt is added to the curd. The curd is placed into molds that press it at for 16 to 18 hours. It is then packaged and ripened for 2 to 3 months at . This process produces of cheese per of milk. Monterey Jack has a similar manufacturing process, with the difference of allowing the curd to sit after draining the whey until it reaches a pH of 5.3. Colby is traditionally pressed into a cylindrical form that is long with a diameter of . In this form, it is also known as a &quot;longhorn&quot;. The cheese can also be pressed into a rectangular form with smaller rectangles or half-moon shapes cut from it.

In its annual report on the dairy industry, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) groups together &quot;other American varieties&quot; of cheese, including Colby, Monterey Jack, and other washed- and stirred-curd varieties. In 2020, the USDA reported that the United States produced of these cheeses at 144 plants. Wisconsin was the leading state with produced at 44 plants, and California produced of cheese at 11 plants.

==Character==

Colby is a semihard cheese. Its washed-curd process produces a moister and softer texture than cheddar. The reduced acidity of the curd results in a mild and milky flavor, with its orange coloring derived from annatto. Compared to more crumbly cheeses such as an English Cheshire, Colby is relatively elastic because its whey is drained at a high pH. The standard of identity in the United States, according to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, dictates that Colby must have a moisture content of 40% or less and that the solids content must contain at least 50% milkfat, resulting in a minimum 30% total fat content of the cheese. In practice, the solids content is typically 52–53%, with a total fat content of 31–32%, and salt content of 1.5–1.8%. Compared to cheddar, the calcium content is slightly lower. Traditional Colby has an open texture with irregular holes. This aspect used to be required by its standard of identity in Wisconsin, but the requirement was removed due to vacuum packaging removing the holes from the cheese and creating a compact texture.

The higher moisture content of Colby compared to cheddar leads to a weak body and it does not keep its quality for as long. It often develops a bitter taste and becomes extremely soft after 100 days, and is typically recommended to be consumed within three months. Foodborne bacteria including &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot; species are less likely to grow in hard or semihard cheeses such as Colby, with a moisture content less than 50%.

==Uses and derivatives==
Because of its mild flavor, Colby is typically used as a table cheese and in snacks, sandwiches, and salads. It can also be grated and combined with other cheeses for use on pizza.

Colby is combined with Monterey Jack to produce a marble cheese known as &quot;Colby-Jack&quot;, where the colored Colby and uncolored Monterey Jack curds are mixed before the pressing and ripening steps. It is more popular than either cheese sold individually, with estimated 2006 supermarket sales of .

Pinconning cheese is a style of Colby named after Pinconning, Michigan, where it was created in 1915 by Dan Horn, who had moved to the city from Wisconsin and found an excess of cows and milk in the city. Pinconning is aged variously, as long as 16 years.

<text>Tongyangxi (), also known as Shim-pua marriage in Hokkien (; and in phonetic Hokkien transcription using Chinese characters: 新婦仔), was a tradition of arranged marriage dating back to pre-modern China, in which a family would adopt a pre-adolescent daughter as a future bride for one of their pre-adolescent (usually infant) sons, and the children would be raised together.

A direct translation of the Hokkien word &quot;sim-pu-a&quot; is &quot;little daughter-in-law&quot;, in which the characters &quot;sim-pu&quot; () mean daughter-in-law and the particle character &quot;a&quot; ( or ) indicates a diminutive. The similarly used Mandarin Chinese term &quot;tongyangxi&quot; () means literally &quot;child (童) raised (養) daughter-in-law (媳)&quot; and is the term typically used as translation for the English term &quot;child bride&quot;.

These child marriages, which guaranteed a wife for a poor son, were more prevalent among the impoverished. So long as they were spared from having to support a daughter who would eventually marry and leave the family, the families who gave up their daughters also gained from this. Since these unions were rarely successful, China outlawed them in 1949. Compulsory education in Taiwan allowed these girls to leave their homes and gain exposure to the outside world, which frequently resulted in their adoption from their adoptive families. The practice ended there by the 1970s.

==Social anthropology perspective==
Within social anthropology research of Chinese marriage, shim-pua marriage is referred to as a &quot;minor marriage&quot; because the daughter-in-law joins her future husband&#x27;s household when both are minors, in contrast to Chinese major marriage, in which the bride joins her husband&#x27;s household on the day of the wedding. The shim-pua daughter was often adopted into a family who already had a son to whom she would be betrothed, though this was not always the case. Instead, some families adopted a shim-pua daughter prior to having a son, prompted by a traditional belief that adopting a shim-pua would enhance a wife&#x27;s likelihood of bearing a son. Although the shim-pua daughter joins the household as a child, the marriage would only occur after both had reached puberty. Depending upon the family&#x27;s socioeconomic status and financial means, the wedding could range from a large banquet on par with a major marriage to a small family ceremony, or in the simplest cases &quot;a bow to the ancestors and a slight change in the family&#x27;s sleeping arrangements.&quot;

Shim-pua marriage occurred over a range of socioeconomic classes, but was particularly common among poor and rural families. Among the well to do, marrying a son in a major marriage was prestigious and a display of status, but also costly. In poorer and more rural communities, shim-pua minor marriage was inexpensive and helped to ensure that no matter how poor a family was, their sons would have wives when they reached marrying age, and thus a greater likelihood of producing descendants. In contrast, the high bride price to acquire a bride for a son to wed in a major marriage could be prohibitive, sometimes as much as a year&#x27;s income for the family. If the family could not afford such a bride for major marriage, this could result in a failure to produce descendants and the end of the family lineage. In contrast, the costs of adopting an infant daughter were low and the costs of raising her as a shim-pua often included only food and clothing. In poor communities, limited wealth or status motivated both the adoption of a shim-pua daughter into the family and the giving up of biological daughters as shim-pua to other families. For a family of limited means or social status, a biological daughter offered little surety; traditionally she would be married off into another family and would neither care for her parents in old age nor extend the family lineage. In contrast, a shim-pua daughter would remain in the household, caring for the parents through their old age, and would bear their descendants. For these reasons, adoption of an infant shim-pua daughter frequently coincided with giving up a biological infant daughter for adoption and then raising the shim-pua daughter in her place.

These marriages were often unsuccessful. This has been explained as a demonstration of the Westermarck effect.

==End of the practice==
In mainland China following the Chinese Communist Revolution, the practice was outlawed by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949.

In Taiwan, several legal issues arose in the 1950s, when shim-pua daughters were registered as adopted daughters, or their male equivalent were registered as adopted sons. Because the couple were legally considered step-siblings, the Taiwanese common law forbade their marriage. Three judicial reviews were made by the Judicial Yuan to allow their marriage. Shim-pua marriage fell out of practice by the 1970s due to increased wealth resulting from Taiwan&#x27;s economic success, making such arrangements unnecessary. One factor that accelerated the demise of shim-pua marriage was the establishment of compulsory public education in Taiwan, which compelled families to send all children, including daughters and adoptive shim-pua daughters to school. Greater exposure outside the home and education itself often created opportunities for shim-pua daughters to resist or escape the marriage arrangement.

==Related concepts==

&quot;Zhaozhui&quot; ( or ) is a related custom by which a wealthy family that lacks an heir might take in a boy child, although such marriages usually involve a procreation-age male. Since these marriages required the husband entering the wife&#x27;s household (contrary to traditional Chinese norms), they were relegated to a lower social status. During the Qing dynasty, these marriages became increasingly common to maintain inheritance bloodlines. The boy would take on the familial name of his new family, and typically would marry the family&#x27;s daughter.

<doc id="752576" wikidata="Q541215" url="?curid=752576" title="Captain Moroni">
<text>According to the Book of Mormon, Captain Moroni was an important Nephite military commander who lived during the first century BC. He is first mentioned in the Book of Alma as &quot;the chief captain over the Nephites.&quot;

Captain Moroni is presented as a righteous and skilled military commander. Among his accomplishments were his extensive preparations for battle and his fierce defense of the right of the Nephites to govern themselves and worship as they saw fit.

Captain Moroni shares a name with the prophet Moroni; the former is indexed in the Book of Mormon as Moroni1.

==Narrative==
In Alma 43:16, the Nephites appoint Moroni, twenty-five years old, to be chief captain of their armies. Moroni leads the Nephite military in the Zoramite War (Alma 43–44) and the Amalickiahite Wars (Alma 46–62).

=== Early command ===
Moroni is appointed in response to a looming war with Lamanites and Zoramites, a force led by Zerahemnah and included many Nephite dissenters. The Lamanite army attacked the Nephites in the land of Jershon and the battle ended on the banks of the river Sidon. In this war, Moroni set to work readying the Nephite people with body armor for the first time. He sent spies to investigate the Lamanites&#x27; weaknesses, and then he led his troops with the plan to surround those of the Lamanites. Moroni&#x27;s overriding objective was to defend his people and their right to worship their God as they pleased. Ultimately, Moroni met that objective, which resulted in keeping many of the Lamanites from ever coming to combat against the Nephites again.

Moroni introduced to the Nephites revolutionary strategies in military tactics, safety, and precaution. He kept the people physically safe while he prayed, guiding and leading his armies by divine intervention. He was also known by his people for his firm ideology and integrity and his constant willingness to support the causes of personal freedom gaining the people&#x27;s trust.

=== Title of Liberty ===

Moroni is associated with the &quot;title of liberty&quot;, a standard that he raised to rally the Nephites to defend their liberties from a group of dissenters who wanted to establish their leader as a king. Moroni was so angry with Amalickiah&#x27;s dissension and wicked influence that he tore his coat and wrote upon it, &quot;In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children.&quot; With those words, he rallied his people to defend their families and their freedom and drive out the armies of Amalickiah. Moroni put to death any dissenters who did not flee and would not support the cause of freedom, and his &quot;title of liberty&quot; was raised over every Nephite tower.

According to the Book of Mormon, Moroni sought to strengthen the Nephites spiritually to be better prepared against the Lamanites, leading Mormon to comment on Moroni&#x27;s righteousness.

=== King-men ===
Years later, Moroni encountered problems with a group of men called &quot;king-men&quot;, who were so called because they wanted to replace the chief judge and democracy with a king, an aim seen as destroying the liberty of the people. Moroni had written to Pahoran for help in the war, and the Lamanites attacked before the help could arrive. Moroni wrote again, chastising Pahoran in the process for failing to respond, even threatening to &quot;stir up insurrections&quot; against what he perceived to be the nonresponsive government authorities. Pahoran wrote back, saying that the king-men had driven him from the judgment seat, and he had been unable to respond to Moroni&#x27;s requests for assistance. Moroni left command of his armies in the hands of his deputies and led an insurrection of the people against the king-men. The leader of the king-men, Pachus, was killed and his followers were taken prisoner. Moroni and Pahoran regained control of the city of Nephihah, which they had lost, restoring the previous form of government by judges.

=== Retirement ===
After fortifying the Nephites&#x27; lands, Moroni transferred command of his armies to his son Moronihah and permanently retired to his own home. Four years later, in the 36th year of the reign of the judges (or around 56 BC), Moroni died. According to the chronology of years, listing the time from when Moroni took command of the armies at 25, he would have been about 45 when he died.

== Reception ==

=== Rhetoric ===
The narrative of Captain Moroni plays a significant role in how members of the LDS Church understand and justify the political realities of war and violence. In this context, important aspects of Moroni&#x27;s narrative include that he &quot;did not delight in the shedding of blood,&quot; his warfare was strictly defensive, he sought the guidance of prophets before battle, and he did not seek for power. When the U.S.-led War in Afghanistan commenced during the LDS Church&#x27;s October 2001 General Conference, Church President Gordon B. Hinckley referenced the story of Captain Moroni saying, &quot;There are times when we must stand up for right and decency, for freedom and civilization, just as Moroni rallied his people in his day to the defense of their wives, their children, and the cause of liberty.&quot;

Some Latter-day Saint authors, such as Nicholeen Peck, have drawn comparisons between the lives of Captain Moroni and General George Washington. Peck writes, &quot;Many many years before George Washington, Captain Moroni did the same thing George Washington did. He wrote the Title of Liberty, and put on his military uniform, to show he would fight for his liberties if it was necessary.&quot; Mormon writer Heather Hemingway makes similar observations by noting, &quot;Captain Moroni’s humility and valor is similar to that of George Washington during the winter of 1777–1778.&quot;

On October 28, 2020, United States Senator Mike Lee, a Latter-day Saint from Utah, compared President Donald Trump to Captain Moroni. Lee told rallygoers in Arizona: &quot;To my Mormon friends, my Latter-day Saint friends, think of him as Captain Moroni.&quot; Lee went on to say that the president &quot;seeks not the praise of the world&quot; and wants only &quot;the well-being and peace of the American people.&quot; Lee&#x27;s comparison was met with extensive backlash. The overwhelming majority of comments on Lee&#x27;s Facebook accounts found it to be &quot;shameful&quot; or &quot;blasphemous.&quot; In a follow-up Facebook post, Lee pointed out that he had praised Trump for his willingness to &quot;threaten the established political order&quot; in spite of the &quot;constant ridicule and scorn&quot; to which this has subjected him and his family. To those who were offended by any suggestion that Trump should be held up as an example of personal righteousness, Lee wrote: &quot;Finally, in no way did I suggest that people should seek to emulate President Trump in the same way they might pattern their lives after Captain Moroni.&quot;

=== Militancy ===
Cliven Bundy, an antigovernment activist and a member of the LDS Church, has frequently made references to the Book of Mormon in his conflicts with the U.S. government. According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, during the Bundy family’s 2014 occupation of federally owned lands in Nevada, Bundy used banners quoting Moroni: &quot;In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children.&quot;

In 2016, Ammon Bundy, a son of Cliven, used much of the same language as his father, &quot;mixing Mormon religious symbolism with a disgust of the federal government,&quot; during an occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. One member of Bundy&#x27;s antigovernment extremist group refused to give any other name to the press than &quot;Captain Moroni, from Utah.&quot; The man calling himself &quot;Captain Moroni&quot; was later identified in media reports and a criminal complaint as 34-year-old Dylan Wade Anderson.

On January 4, 2016, the LDS Church released a statement strongly condemning the armed seizure of the facility by the antigovernment activists in the standoff at the wildlife refuge, expressing deep concern the activists were suggesting their actions were justified on a scriptural basis, and affirming American civic life provides for peaceful resolution of conflict between government and private groups, according to the laws of the land.

On January 6, 2021, a banner copying the Title of Liberty was displayed by those attacking the US Capitol. That evening, the church released a statement. &quot;We peacefully accept the results of elections. We will not participate in the violence threatened by those disappointed with the outcome,&quot; Dallin H. Oaks said. &quot;In a democratic society, we always have the opportunity and the duty to persist peacefully until the next election.&quot;

<doc id="752593" wikidata="Q956056" url="?curid=752593" title="Transylvania University">
<text>Transylvania University is a private university in Lexington, Kentucky, United States. It was founded in 1780 and is the oldest university in Kentucky. It offers 46 major programs, as well as dual-degree engineering programs, and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Its medical program has graduated 8,000 physicians since 1859.

Transylvania&#x27;s name, meaning &quot;across the woods&quot; in Latin, stems from the university&#x27;s founding in the heavily forested region of western Virginia known as the Transylvania Colony, which existed briefly between 1775 and 1776 in south and western Kentucky.

It is the alma mater of two U.S. vice presidents, two U.S. Supreme Court justices, 50 U.S. senators, 101 U.S. representatives, 36 U.S. governors, and 34 U.S. ambassadors, making it a large producer of 19th century U.S. statesmen.

==History==
Transylvania—Latin for &#x27;across the woods&#x27;—was the first college west of the Allegheny Mountains and was named for the short-lived Transylvania Colony. The Virginia Assembly chartered Transylvania Seminary in 1780, before Kentucky became a separate state. It was chiefly promoted by Presbyterians. Initially situated in a log cabin in Boyle County, Kentucky, the school moved to Lexington in 1789. The first site in Lexington was a single building in what is now the historic Gratz Park.

By 1799, the institution was called Transylvania University. By 1818, a new main building was constructed for students&#x27; classes. That building burned down in 1829, and the school was moved to its location north of Third Street. Old Morrison was erected 1830–34, under the supervision of Henry Clay, who both taught law and was a member of Transylvania&#x27;s Board. By 1818, the university included a medical school, law school, a divinity school, and a college of arts and sciences.

The Disciples of Christ church founded Bacon College in Georgetown. It operated from 1837 to 1851 and 1858 to 1861. It was renamed Kentucky University in 1858. In 1865, the remnants of the school were merged into Transylvania University. The merged institution took the name &quot;Kentucky University.&quot;

From these early years, Transylvania has dominated academe in the bluegrass region and was the sought-after destination for the children of the South&#x27;s political leadership, military families, and business elite. It attracted many politically ambitious young men, including Stephen F. Austin, the founder of Texas.

===After the Civil War===

The new institution used Transylvania&#x27;s campus in Lexington while perpetuating the Kentucky University name. The university was reorganized into several new colleges, including the Agricultural and Mechanical College (A&amp;M) of Kentucky, publicly chartered as a department of Kentucky University as a land-grant institution under the Morrill Act. However, due to questions regarding having a federally funded land-grant college controlled by a religious body, the A&amp;M college was spun off in 1878 as an independent, state-run institution. The A&amp;M of Kentucky soon developed into one of the state&#x27;s flagship public universities, the University of Kentucky. Kentucky University&#x27;s College of the Bible, which traced its roots to Bacon College&#x27;s Department of Hebrew Literature, received a separate charter in 1878. Kentucky University&#x27;s seminary eventually separated but remained on the same campus until 1950. It later changed its name to the Lexington Theological Seminary. In 1903, Hamilton College, a Lexington-based women&#x27;s college founded in 1869, merged into Kentucky University.

Due to confusion between Kentucky University and its daughter institution, the University of Kentucky, it was renamed &quot;Transylvania University&quot; in 1908.

===1988 trademark dispute===
In 1988, Transylvania University experienced an infringement on the institution&#x27;s trademark when Hallmark Cards began selling &quot;Transylvania University&quot; T-shirts. The product, developed for the Halloween season, was intended to be a novelty item purporting to be college wear from the fictional Count Dracula&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;. When contacted by Transylvania University, Hallmark admitted that they were unaware of the Kentucky-based institution and immediately recalled all unsold products.

==Campus==
The university is located on a urban campus about four blocks from the center of the city of Lexington, Kentucky. It has 24 buildings, 3 athletic fields, 3 dining areas, and a National Historic Landmark. The campus is divided by North Broadway: to the East stand the academic buildings of the university; to the West, most of the residential buildings.

===Academic campus===

The academic side of campus lies to the East of North Broadway, one of the major streets in Lexington. Old Morrison is the central administration building. Designed by pioneer Kentucky architect Gideon Shryock and erected in 1833 under the supervision of Henry Clay (then professor of law at Transylvania), Old Morrison is the central image on the city seal of Lexington. It houses the offices of financial aid, accounting, the registrar, the president, the dean, communications, the Center for Academic and Professional Enrichment, and more. The building also holds the tomb of Constantine Rafinesque, professor of natural science at the university from 1819 to 1826, and Sauveur Francois Bonfils, who taught at the university from 1842 to 1849 (a native of France, he was forced to flee because of political discord). During the Civil War, Old Morrison was a hospital for Union and Confederate soldiers. It was gutted by fire in 1969 but was renovated and reopened in 1971. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 in recognition of the university&#x27;s status as the oldest west of the Allegheny Mountains.

Beside Old Morrison, the Carpenter Academic Center houses the faculties of English, philosophy, history, political science, foreign languages, and classics, as well as offices for professors. The center, formerly known as Haupt Humanities, was renovated during the 2017–2018 academic year; the renovation updated classrooms and faculty offices, added student gathering spaces and integrated new technologies. Carpenter Academic Center was reopened in May 2018.

Behind the Carpenter Academic Center is Alumni Plaza, which opened in 2015 as an outdoor classroom and social gathering area. Also on the academic side of campus, a state-of-the-art student indoor athletic facility, called the Clive M. Beck Center, was completed and opened in 2003; it is a location for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletics and holds student fitness equipment.

The Mitchell Fine Arts Center is the home of the music program, providing offices and classrooms for drama and music programs. It contains a large concert hall, a small theater, a recital hall, the Morlan Gallery, the music technology classroom, and the Office of Information Technology. The Morlan Gallery in the center is the location for six or seven art exhibitions every year during the academic calendar, primarily as a gallery of contemporary art, including Appalachian folk art, Chinese art, contemporary African art, sculptural installations, and performance and video pieces. The gallery offers guided tours and lectures for school groups, civic clubs, and senior-citizen organizations.

The Cowgill Center for Business, Economics, and Education holds classrooms for these subjects and offices for professors. It features a high-tech multimedia classroom, a specialized classroom for training education majors, a computer lab, lecture halls, seminar rooms, study areas, faculty offices, and the Monroe Moosnick Medical and Science Museum. The L.A. Brown Science Center houses classrooms, laboratories and offices for the natural sciences, computer science, and mathematics programs. A state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer is available to enhance students&#x27; academic and research experience.

===Library===
Originally completed in 1952 and dedicated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the main library building was renovated and enlarged in 1985; it was re-dedicated by then Vice President George H. W. Bush as the Douglas Gay Jr. and Frances Carrick Thomas Library. The Special Collections of the library houses a manuscript collection with letters, diaries, and documents of notable historical figures associated with the university, including Henry Clay, Jefferson Davis, Robert Peter, John Wesley Hunt, Daniel Drake, and Horace Holley. The rare books section houses a collection of books relating to the history of horses and natural history and a collection of pre-1800 medical books. The books belonging to the Transylvania Medical Department, which closed in 1859, are now kept in special collections. The library was the setting for the film &quot;American Animals&quot;, which told how four twenty-year-old students stole and attempted to sell some of the rare books.

The basement of the library was renovated and became the Dugi Academic Center for Excellence in 2013 and the first floor was renovated in 2015.

The Glenn Building was constructed as a multi-purpose building in 2005 and houses a coffee shop, Gratz Perk, admissions offices, and expansion space for the library. It was named in honor of James F. Glenn, a former Board of Trustees member who donated $1.1 million for its construction. It utilizes an environmentally friendly geothermal heating and air conditioning system, and several mature trees near the site were preserved during construction.

===Residence halls===
The western half of the campus contains most of the residential parts of the campus. Dalton-Voigt Hall opened in the fall of 2015 and houses first-year students. This $7 million, 144-bed facility offers suite-style living and common spaces for studying and activities. Jefferson Davis Hall and Henry Clay Hall were demolished in June 2015 to make space for construction of Kincaid Hall and Bassett Hall, which are similar to Dalton-Voigt and opened in January 2017.

Thomson Hall was opened in the fall of 2008. It received Energy Star rating in 2009. It features 31 suite-style units, including study areas, living rooms, kitchenettes, bathrooms, and bedrooms. The building is three stories tall, has of space, and cost $5.5 million.
Thomson Hall was built to be environmentally friendly and exceeds state insulating value requirements by 28 percent. It has geothermal heating and energy, low-flow shower heads, a total energy recovery wheel on outside ventilation, fifty percent recycled material in the parking lot surface, and energy-saving lighting.

Dalton-Voigt, Thomson, Kincaid, and Bassett Halls surround Back Circle, a central outdoor field where students can socialize, play sports, or do homework.

The other residence spaces on campus are Poole Residence Center and Rosenthal Apartment Complex. Poole houses first-year students in large, suite-style rooms. Rosenthal houses upper-class students in an outdoor apartment style.

===Campus Center===
The newly built and renovated William T. Young Campus Center opened in the fall of 2020. It is a building—61,400 square feet of new construction and 36,310 square feet of renovated space. Replacing Forrer Hall, the structure offers two dining locations, an athletic workout facility, a competition-sized swimming pool, and numerous meeting spaces of all sizes and uses. It also houses the health and wellness center, student life offices, and the bookstore.

The Campus Center was dedicated in October 2021 where William T. Young Sr., whom the original Campus Center was named for, and William T. Young Jr. were recognized for their many contributions to the university over the years. Both chaired the Transylvania Board of Trustees. Portraits of both Youngs adorn a wall of the new Center to commemorate the family&#x27;s contributions.

==Academics==

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Transylvania University has an acceptance rate of 92%. Accepted applicants have an SAT score range (25th–75th percentile) of 1050–1360. Transylvania presently offers 46 majors and 37 minors and many pre-professional tracks spread among four divisions: Fine Arts, Humanities, Natural Sciences &amp; Mathematics and Social Sciences. It offers such majors as Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) and Writing, Rhetoric, and Communication (WRC), as well as interdisciplinary studies, or the ability of students to design their majors.

In 2018, Transylvania became the first of Kentucky&#x27;s liberal arts colleges to partner with the Peace Corps to establish a Peace Corps Prep program, a diversity-oriented program designed to prepare undergraduates for international development fieldwork and potential Peace Corps service.

Transylvania also partnered with Appalachian Regional Healthcare to incentivize students from Eastern Kentucky and West Virginia interested in healthcare, whether as a practitioner or administrator, to attend Transylvania. Students who participate will return to their home region and communities to work for ARH post-graduation.

==Student life==
Before beginning classes, first-year students participate in an orientation week and various community-building exercises, including long-standing traditions, such as the first-year serenade and greet line. The serenade divides the class in two for a fun sing-off. The greeting line starts as a large arch comprising every member of the first-year class (and various faculty, staff, and campus student leaders). Every line member goes down and shakes hands with all other members, introducing themselves along the way. 

There is a week-long celebration of Halloween by students known as &quot;Raf Week&quot; in honor of the 19th-century botanist, inventor, and Transylvania professor Constantine Rafinesque. The university ends October with a unique combination of activities, including a lottery for four students to win the chance to spend the night in Rafinesque&#x27;s tomb. The steps of Old Morrison are lined with pumpkins carved by students, faculty, staff, and members of the community around Halloween for what is called Pumpkinmania. In honor of Professor Rafinesque, the grab-and-go dining space in the Campus Center is named the &quot;Rafskeller&quot;—a pun on the word &quot;Rathskeller&quot;.

Transylvania is also known for the Kissing Tree, a white ash tree estimated to be nearly 280 years old–35 years older than the university itself. In the 1940s and 1950s, the administration ignored students kissing in public near the tree when it was frowned upon elsewhere on campus. Today, with the rules on public displays of affection slackened, students refer to the tree as the Kissing Tree. In 2003, &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; included the Kissing Tree among the most romantic places on college campuses in America and was mentioned in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article about romance on college campuses.

===Arts===
The campus, home to various Transylvania choirs and instrumental ensembles, also hosts several exhibitions in its Morlan Gallery that change by season. The gallery focuses on work produced in the past decade from worldwide viewpoints. Transylvania was honored with an international Gold Award for &quot;Transylvania Treasures&quot;, its publication dedicated to showcasing the rare and valuable items in Transylvania University&#x27;s special collections and medical and science museum, and now is considered a treasure in its own right, concluding a prestigious national competition sponsored by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. Transylvania&#x27;s theatre department produces two to three stage productions every year. The Lucille C. Little Theater provides a performance space for theatre performances by students and professionals on campus.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Transylvania has Greek life on campus, with five fraternities and five sororities and 42% of the students as members of Greek organizations. In its 2022 edition of &quot;The Best 387 Colleges&quot;, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; named Transylvania in the top 10 U.S. schools on its list of colleges with &quot;Lots of Greek Life&quot;.

==Athletics==
Transylvania&#x27;s athletic teams are nicknamed the Pioneers. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference (HCAC) since the 2001–02 academic year. The Pioneers previously competed in the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC; now known as the River States Conference (RSC) since the 2016–17 school year) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1916–17 to 2000–01.

Transylvania competes in 27 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, triathlon and volleyball; and co-ed teams include cheerleading, dance and equestrian (eventing).

The Transylvania Pioneers student-athletes compete under colors crimson and white at a variety of venues throughout the country; maintain successful results; and often compete against larger institutions including Ohio University.

Philanthropists have increased sizable gifts to the university in its present period more so than ever before, and coaches at Transylvania University have been continually recognized for athletic achievements.

=== Football ===

Transylvania won the first-recorded football game in the state of Kentucky by defeating the Centre Praying Colonels of Centre College 13–0. Its 1903 team claimed a southern championship. The Pioneers played football from 1888 to 1941 (except 1906), when the team disbanded.

==Notable people==

Amongst Transylvania&#x27;s prominent alumni are two U.S. vice presidents, John C. Breckinridge and Richard Mentor Johnson, and two U.S. Supreme Court justices, John Marshall Harlan and Samuel Freeman Miller.

<doc id="752594" wikidata="Q6642428" url="?curid=752594" title="List of tallest structures in the United States">
<text>The height of structures in the United States has been poorly documented. However, the data is a matter of public record, appearing in documents maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

This list is populated heavily by antenna masts. The engineering aspects of super-tall masts are highly specialized. Only four companies erect the majority of such structures: Doty Moore Tower Services (Cedar Hill, Texas); Kline Towers (Columbia, South Carolina); LeBlanc Royal Telecom (Oakville, Ontario); and Stainless Inc. (North Wales, Pennsylvania). The design and construction are largely governed by RS222E Electronic Industries Alliance standards. A tall mast costs between $0.7 and $1.1 million to build, while a tall mast costs $2.4 to $4 million. Prices generally vary depending on tower capacity and wind loading specifications.

A common misperception is that landmarks such as the Stratosphere Tower are the tallest United States structures, but they are in fact the tallest &quot;buildings&quot;. Likewise, Taipei 101 was often misrepresented as the world&#x27;s tallest structure (although it was the tallest occupied building, before the certification of Dubai&#x27;s Burj Khalifa as such), but in fact is far eclipsed by antenna towers in over a dozen states in the United States and in other countries.

In the United States, the FAA and the FCC must approve all towers exceeding in height. Furthermore, it is very difficult to get permission for structures over tall. The FCC presumes them to be inconsistent with the public interest, while the FAA presumes them to be a hazard to air navigation, resulting in poor airspace usage. A significant burden of proof is placed on the applicant to show that such a structure is in the public&#x27;s best interests. Only when both agencies have resolved all legal, safety, and management concerns is such an application approved.

Since 1978, the United States has maintained 11 tethered aerostats sites along the southern borders. These balloons rise to , carrying radar units for drug interdiction purposes. However, since the balloons are aided by buoyancy and are not permanent, they are not considered true structures.

This tower was built because the owners of WBIR-TV could not obtain land atop nearby House Mountain, because the only land suitable for a television tower base on the mountain had been purchased by the station&#x27;s main competitor WATE-TV, Knoxville. When completed, it was, for a short time the tallest man-made structure on Earth.

<doc id="752596" wikidata="Q2075161" url="?curid=752596" title="Tirumular">
<text>Tirumular, also known as Suntaranāthar, was a Tamil Shaivite mystic and writer, considered one of the sixty-three poet-saints called the Nayanars, and is listed among a group of 18 sages called the Siddhars. His magnum opus, the &quot;Tirumantiram&quot;, consisting of over 3000 verses, forms a part of the key text of the Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta compilation called the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;.

== Chronology ==
The dates of Tirumular&#x27;s life are controversial, and because his work makes reference to so many currents of religious thought, the dates that different scholars assign are often appealed to for anchoring the relative chronology of other literature in Tamil and Sanskrit. Verse 74 of the &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; makes the claim that Tirumular lived for 7 &quot;yuga&quot;s (ages) before composing the &quot;Tirumantiram&quot;.

Some are therefore inclined to place his composition well before the Common Era. The scholar and lexicographer S. Vaiyapuripillai, however, suggested that he probably belonged to the beginning of the eighth-century CE, pointing out that Tirumular could not very well be placed earlier given that he appears to refer to the &quot;Tevaram&quot; hymns of Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar, that he used &quot;very late words&quot; and that he made mention of the weekdays.
Others wish to push the date still later: Dominic Goodall, for instance, appears to suggest, on the grounds of religious notions that appear in the work with Tamil labels for which a certain historical development can be traced in other datable works, that the &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; cannot be placed before the 11th- or 12th-century CED. Yet another view, alluded to for instance by Vaiyapuripillai (&quot;ibid.&quot;), is that the text may contain an ancient core, but with &quot;a good number of interpolated stanzas&quot; of later date. Whatever the case, allusions to works and ideas in the &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; cannot, at least for the moment, be used as useful indicators of their chronology.

== Legend ==
Suntaranāthar, as the saint was known, was a yogi originally from then Madurai. According to legend, he is believed to have travelled to Mount Kailash, where he was initiated by the deity Shiva. After spending 5 years at Mount Kailash, he undertook a journey under the order of Shiva to Tamilakam to meet his contemporary, the sage Agastya in Pothigai Hills. After meeting Agastya, he went to Chidambaram, and after worshiping Shiva at the Nataraja Temple, he was about to return to Mount Kailash. During his journey, near Sathanur village (a village near Aaduthurai), he saw a group of cows crying. He discovered that their cowherd, Mulan, was dead, having been bitten by a snake. Touched by the sight of the cows, he decided to use his yogic powers and move his soul from his body to that of the dead cowherd&#x27;s, leaving his own body inside a log. On waking up in the body of the cowherd, the cows became happy; he then motioned them towards the village. When the saint wished to return to his own body, he was surprised to find that it was nowhere to be found. At this moment, he heard a divine voice from the sky, that of Shiva, who told him that he had been behind the disappearance of the body. The deity told him that he wished the saint to spread his teachings through the body of Mulan, allowing him to preach to the common folk in the vernacular Tamil spoken by the cowherd, as opposed to the literary Tamil in which the saint was well-versed. Suntaranāthar was henceforth called &quot;Tiru&quot;mular, &quot;tiru&quot; meaning an epithet indicating respect. The saint is regarded to have engaged in meditation under a peepal tree in Thiruvavaduthurai, receiving holy hymns in Tamil. These three thousand holy hymns were compiled to become the book called the &quot;Tirumantiram&quot;.

<doc id="752599" wikidata="Q234793" url="?curid=752599" title="Joan Robinson">
<text>Joan Violet Robinson ( Maurice; 31 October 1903 – 5 August 1983) was a British economist known for her wide-ranging contributions to economic theory. One of the most prominent economists of the century, Robinson incarnated the &quot;Cambridge School&quot; in most of its guises in the 20th century. She started out as a Marshallian, became one of the earliest and most ardent Keynesians after 1936, and ended up as a leader of the neo-Ricardian and post-Keynesian schools.

==Early life and education==
Before leaving to fight in the Second Boer War, Joan&#x27;s father, Frederick Maurice, married Margaret Helen Marsh, the daughter of Frederick Howard Marsh, and the sister of Edward Marsh, at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. Joan Violet Maurice was born in 1903, a year after her father&#x27;s return from Africa, the third of five siblings.

Joan Maurice studied economics at Girton College, Cambridge. She completed her studies in 1925 but due to Cambridge University&#x27;s refusal to grant degrees to women until 1948, she did not formally graduate. Following her marriage to economist Austin Robinson the next year, she became known as Joan Robinson.

The couple moved to India shortly after their marriage where Joan Robinson became interested in the relations between the British Raj and the Indian princely states and wrote a report on the subject. This time in India was a formative experience on Robinson, shaping her future research interest in both the country and her studies of developing economies. In 1928, the couple returned to Cambridge and Robinson started teaching in the early 1930s as a Junior Assistant Lecturer.

== Career ==
Robinson crossed swords with the economist Marjorie Hollond, Girton&#x27;s director of studies, over the teaching of economics. Robinson wanted to teach the latest economic theories whereas Hollond believed that they were as yet unproven. In 1937, Robinson became a lecturer in economics at the University of Cambridge. She joined the British Academy in 1958 and was elected a fellow of Newnham College in 1962. In 1965 she assumed the position of full professor and fellow of Girton College. In 1979, just four years before she died, she became the first female honorary fellow of King&#x27;s College.

As a member of &quot;the Cambridge School&quot; of economics, Robinson contributed to the support and exposition of Keynes&#x27; General Theory, writing especially on its employment implications in 1936 and 1937 (it attempted to explain employment dynamics in the midst of the Great Depression).

During World War II, Robinson worked on a few different committees for the wartime national government. During this time, she visited the Soviet Union as well as China, gaining an interest in underdeveloped and developing nations.

Robinson was a frequent visitor to Centre for Development Studies (CDS), Thiruvananthapuram, India. She was a visiting fellow at the Centre in the mid-1970s. She instituted an endowment fund to support public lectures at the centre. She was a frequent visitor to the centre until January 1982 and participated in all activities of the centre and especially student seminars. Professor Robinson donated royalties of two of her books (&quot;Selected Economic Writings&quot;, Bombay: Oxford University Press, 1974, &quot;Introduction to Modern Economics&quot; (jointly with John Eatwell), Delhi; Tata McGraw Hill, 1974) to CDS.

Robinson also made several trips to China, reporting her observations and analyses in &quot;China: An Economic Perspective&quot; (1958), &quot;The Cultural Revolution in China&quot; (1969), and &quot;Economic Management in China&quot; (1975; 3rd edn, 1976), in which she praised the Cultural Revolution. In October 1964, Robinson also visited North Korea, which was effectively a single-party Communist state, and wrote in her report &quot;Korean Miracle&quot; that the country&#x27;s success was due to &quot;the intense concentration of the Koreans on national pride&quot; under Kim Il Sung, &quot;a messiah rather than a dictator.&quot; She also stated in reference to the division of Korea that &quot;[o]bviously, sooner or later the country must be reunited by absorbing the South into socialism.&quot; During her last decade, she became more and more pessimistic about the possibilities of reforming economic theory, as expressed, for example, in her essay &quot;Spring Cleaning.&quot;

Robinson was a strict vegetarian. She slept in a small unheated hut at the bottom of her garden all year round.

== Works ==
In 1933, her book &quot;The Economics of Imperfect Competition&quot;, Robinson coined the term &quot;monopsony&quot;, which is used to describe the buyer converse of a seller monopoly. Monopsony is commonly applied to buyers of labour, where the employer has wage setting power that allows it to exercise Pigouvian exploitation and pay workers less than their marginal productivity. Robinson used monopsony to describe the wage gap between women and men workers of equal productivity.

In 1942, Robinson&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Marxian Economics&quot; famously concentrated on Karl Marx as an economist, helping to revive the debate on this aspect of his legacy.

In 1956, Robinson published her magnum opus, &quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot;, which extended Keynesianism into the long run.

In 1962, she published &quot;Essays in the Theory of Economic Growth&quot;, another book on growth theory, which discussed Golden Age growth paths. Afterwards, she developed the Cambridge growth theory with Nicholas Kaldor. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1964.

In 1964 she made important contributions to the field of economic methodology. She explored the philosophical foundations of economic analysis in her influential book Economic Philosophy, criticizing traditional methodological approaches and arguing in favor of a more diverse and interdisciplinary approach to economics. She promoted a more practical and historically informed approach that considers the social and institutional environment within which economic phenomena occur.

In 1984, Robinson was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Near the end of her life, she studied and concentrated on methodological problems in economics and tried to recover the original message of Keynes&#x27; General Theory. Between 1962 and 1980, she wrote many economics books for the general public. Robinson suggested developing an alternative to the revival of classical economics.

&quot;The Cultural Revolution in China,&quot; 1968, is written from the perspective of trying to understand the thinking that lay behind the revolution, particularly Mao Zedong&#x27;s preoccupations. 

In June 2019, the United States Supreme Court used Robinson&#x27;s monopsony theory in its decision for &quot;Apple v. Pepper&quot;. Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered the majority opinion, stating Apple can be sued by application developers, &quot;on a monopsony theory.&quot;

== Achievements ==
In 1945, she was appointed to the Ministry of Works&#x27; Advisory Committee on Building Research, the only economist and the only female member of that committee.

In 1948, she was appointed the first economist member of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

In 1949, she was invited by Ragnar Frisch to become the vice-president of the Econometric Society but declined by saying she that could not be part of the editorial committee of a journal that she could not read. 

During the 1960s, she was a major participant in the Cambridge capital controversy alongside Piero Sraffa.

At least two students who studied under her have won the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel; they are Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz. In his autobiographical notes for the Nobel Foundation, Stiglitz described their relationship as &quot;tumultuous&quot; and Robinson as unused to &quot;the kind of questioning stance of a brash American student&quot;; after a term, Stiglitz therefore &quot;switched to Frank Hahn&quot;. In his own autobiography notes, Sen described Robinson as &quot;totally brilliant but vigorously intolerant.&quot;

She also influenced Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh which altered his approach towards economic policies.

=== Discussion surrounding the Nobel Prize ===
Robinson never received a Nobel Prize for her contribution to economics. She was widely anticipated to receive the prize for Economics in 1975, and Rachel Reeves described her as &#x27;the most famous economist not to be awarded the Nobel Prize&#x27;. Of all 93 recipients of the Nobel Prize in Economic Science, only 10 winners have been cited more widely than Robinson. It is widely assumed that the committee&#x27;s oversight of Robinson was due to her outspoken support of Mao&#x27;s economic policies in China, but others have argued this is instead due to sexism within the awarding committee.

== Family ==
Robinson&#x27;s father was Frederick Maurice, her mother was Margaret Helen Marsh. The London surgeon and Cambridge academic Howard Marsh was Joan Robinson&#x27;s maternal grandfather.

Joan Maurice married fellow economist Austin Robinson in 1926. They had two daughters.

== Recognition ==

In 2016, the Council of the University of Cambridge approved the use of Robinson&#x27;s name to mark a physical feature within the North West Cambridge Development.

In April 2024, a blue plaque was erected in Kensington Gardens, London, to honour Robinson&#x27;s life and work. English Heritage, the awarding organisation, described her as &#x27;one of the first women to achieve academic prominence in the discipline of economics&#x27;.

The economics society of Girton College, Cambridge is named the Joan Robinson Society.

<text>Tzadik ( &quot;ṣaddīq&quot; , &quot;righteous [one]&quot;; also &quot;zadik&quot; or &quot;sadiq&quot;; pl. &quot;tzadikim&quot; &quot;ṣadīqīm&quot;) is a title in Judaism given to people considered righteous, such as biblical figures and later spiritual masters. The root of the word &quot;ṣadiq&quot;, is &quot;ṣ-d-q&quot; ( &quot;tsedek&quot;), which means &quot;justice&quot; or &quot;righteousness&quot;. When applied to a righteous woman, the term is inflected as &quot;tzadeket&quot; singularly or &quot;tzidkaniot&quot; in the plural.

&quot;Tzadik&quot; is also the root of the word &quot;tzedakah&quot; (&#x27;charity&#x27;, literally &#x27;righteousness&#x27;). The term &quot;tzadik&quot; &quot;righteous&quot;, and its associated meanings, developed in rabbinic thought from its Talmudic contrast with &quot;hasid&quot; (&quot;pious&quot; honorific), to its exploration in ethical literature, and its esoteric spiritualisation in Kabbalah.

Since the late 17th century, in Hasidic Judaism, the institution of the mystical tzadik as a divine channel assumed central importance, combining popularization of (hands-on) Jewish mysticism with social movement for the first time. Adapting former Kabbalistic theosophical terminology, Hasidic philosophy internalised mystical experience, emphasising devekut attachment to its Rebbe leadership, who embody and channel the Divine flow of blessing to the world.

==Etymology==

&quot;Ṣedeq&quot; in Canaanite religion may have been an epithet of a god of the Jebusites. The Hebrew word appears in the biblical names Melchizedek, Adonizedek, and Zadok, the high priest of David.

==Nature of the &quot;Tzadik&quot;==

===Definitions===
In classic Jewish thought, there are various definitions of a &quot;tzadik&quot;. According to Maimonides (based on Tractate Yevamot of the Babylonian Talmud 49b-50a): &quot;One whose merit surpasses his iniquity is a &quot;tzadik&quot;&quot;.

According to Shneur Zalman of Liadi&#x27;s &quot;Tanya&quot;, a work of Hasidic Judaism, the true title of &quot;tzadik&quot; denotes a spiritual description of the soul. Its true meaning can only be applied to one who has completely sublimated their natural &quot;animal&quot; or &quot;vital&quot; soul inclinations into holiness, so that they experience only love and awe of God, without material temptations. Hence, a tzadik serves as a vehicle (מרכבה &quot;merkavah&quot;) to God and has no ego or self-consciousness. Note that a person cannot attain such a level, rather it is granted from on High (or born with, etc.). This select level elevates the &quot;Intermediate&quot; person &quot;(beinoni)&quot; into one who never sins in thought, speech or action. Unlike the Tzadik, they only experience divine &quot;devekut&quot; (communion) during devoted moments of worship or study, while in mundane life they can be tempted by natural inclinations, but always choose to stay connected to holiness. In the Tanya the difference between the former Talmudic-Maimonidean and latter Kabbalistic-Hasidic conceptions is raised. Since the &quot;Torah has 70 facets&quot; of interpretation, perhaps both conceptions are metaphysically true:
===Tzadikim Nistarim===
The Talmud says that at least 36 &quot;Tzadikim Nistarim&quot; (anonymous &quot;tzadikim&quot;) are living among us in all times.

===Tzaddik of the Generation===

Hasidim adhere to the belief that there is a person born each generation with the potential to become Messiah, if the Jewish people warrant his coming. This candidate is known as the &quot;Tzadik Ha-Dor&quot;, meaning Tzaddik of the Generation.

===Miracle workers===

While &quot;tzadik&quot; status, according to its above definitions, is not necessarily related to the ability to perform or call upon miracles, the term &quot;tzadik&quot; is often used loosely by the Talmud to indicate those who have achieved especially outstanding piety and holiness. In this context, the &quot;tzadik&#x27;s&quot; prayers are considered especially potent, as the Talmud states: &quot;A &quot;tzadik&quot; decrees and the Holy One (blessed be He) fulfills.&quot; This is line with the Talmudic dictum: Rabban Gamliel the son of Rabbi Judah haNasi used to say: &quot;Make His Will your own will, that He make your will as His Will.&quot;

==In Muslim Countries and Israel==
The veneration of tzadikim and the veneration of prophets and other figures from the Torah, Bible, and Quran overlapped significantly, as did the veneration of figures from one religion by other local religions. Certain theological concepts overlapped as well. In the Medieval Muslim worldview, places like Egypt, al-Shām (especially Syria), and Karbala were holy or blessed land, though not necessarily as much as Mecca, Medinah, and Jerusalem. Jews never regarded other cities as sacred as Jerusalem, but lands like Syria, Iraq, and Egypt were also seen holy. A more specific location often became holy when someone saw a prophet or saint in a vision and was told to build a shrine. The prophet or saint made the place holy, but their granting of holiness was limited. The holiness was perpetuated via ritual behaviors such as prayer, supplication, votive offerings, sprinkling perfume and water, laying on the shrines and tombs, living in them, circumambulation, touching, and taking soil and rocks away that were thought to heal through &quot;baraka&quot;. These actions marked the sites associated with saints and prophets as separate from their surroundings. Sites that were destroyed and never rebuilt were seen as having lost favor with God, the prophets, and the saints. Sites also became holy due to their place in scripture, eschatological tradition, legends, local performance of ritual, the import/export of sacred objects and substances, and the production and display of talismans. Saint and prophet shrines were more common in cities, but plenty have been recorded in rural areas. 

Saints and prophets in the view of Medieval Jews and Muslims possessed baraka (which can be translated as &quot;blessing&quot;), an innate force which was also conferred into objects they&#x27;d used or places they&#x27;d been, both of which are very important to saint veneration. Jews also use the word qadosh (&quot;holiness&quot;) in the same context. In both religions, God is the ultimate source of holiness, and holiness comes from being or having been in service of God. While some ideas, such as these, are shared, and saints were common in popular Jewish practice at various points in time, Judaism does not have a doctrine for sainthood in the way Islam does. This is despite the fact that saint veneration was common among Medieval Jewish communities in the region. One of the key traits throughout history, from the writing of 1 Kings to the Modern era, of a Jewish saint is their ability to produce rain. 

Holy places, particularly the shrines and tombs associated with saints and prophets, were associated with supernatural sensory phenomena, particularly in the pre-modern era. This includes unnatural lights descending to holy sites or emanating from them, visions, unexplained pleasant smells, and clouds ascending from shrines or hovering over them. Both Jews and Muslims also said that a shrine of a prophet or saint would evoke a feeling of awe or holiness.

Hagiographic style literature, called &quot;ma&#x27;asiyyot&quot; (meaning tales, legends, or deeds), was published by Medieval Jews, such as A Book of Belief after Advertisity, published in the 11th century by the Jewish sage Ibn Shahin.

Both votive and free will offerings were common at saint&#x27;s shrines, and could be done for an individual&#x27;s sake, or for the sake of an entire community.

Some Jewish literature places the tzadikim above the angels. 
===Egypt===
In Egypt, Jewish saint veneration is not often a topic of research and is not prominently practiced today, though a number of Egyptian saints are said to be Jews who converted to Islam. There are three Jewish mausoleums in Egypt currently associated with the practice: Maimondes&#x27; tomb in Musky, Cairo; Sidi al-Amshati&#x27;s tomb in El-Mahalla El-Kubra in Gharbia, which has not hosted any celebrations for some time; and Hatsera&#x27;s mausoleum near Damanhur in Beheria. The Synagogue of Moses at Dammuh was also well regarded as a holy pilgrimage site, and in the Medieval era, other synagogues devoted to Moses and many shrines to Elijah existed. Such shrines commemorated the various places Elijah had taken refuge from King Ahab in.

The Synagogue of Moses was important to both Karaite and Rabbinic Jews, and was particularly important on Shavuot (which commemorates the giving of the Torah), and on the 7th of Adar (Moses&#x27;s birthday). The 7th itself would be full of fasting and prayer, while the 8th was a more festive occasion. People would travel from all over Egypt to visit the Synagogue at these times. Pilgrims lit candles, burned incense, played music and games, and danced. Pilgrimage here was considered by some to be a substitute for pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The Synagogue was destroyed in 1498 on the orders of Qansuh al-Ghawri, but even after this it remained in the popular consciousness of Egyptian Jews. 

In Egypt, Israel, and Syria, some synagogues had a small room (a &quot;hevyah&quot;, &quot;hidden enclosure&quot;) inside them that served as a shrine to Elijah, who was seen as somewhat equivalent to al Khadir. These were often in caves under the synagogue, and in Egypt and Palestine, occasionally were described as having chairs of Elijah and eternal lights inside them.

Hatsera was a Moroccan rabbi who died in Egypt while on pilgrimage, and was subsequently buried in Egypt. His tomb has been taken care of by Muslim Egyptians for many years, though it and it&#x27;s pilgrimage has become a contentious legal and political issue. The tomb sits on a hill, and all hilltop tombs in Egypt are believed to protect surrounding villages from floods. Many locals mistakenly believe he was Muslim, or do not know what religion he was. A few even believe he was a Christian from the Pre-Islamic era. The local Muslim villagers often visit his tomb for healing, protection from the evil eye, or before Friday prayers. 89 other Jewish graves surround Hatsera&#x27;s tomb.

In the anniversary of Hatsera&#x27;s death, pilgrims come on a &quot;hillūla&quot; journey, mostly from Morocco and France. A market pops up, and pilgrims gather in the tomb to pray, ask for blessings, and place items on the grave in hopes they&#x27;ll be blessed. After the prayers, a meal is held. A rabbi and one of Hatsera&#x27;s descendants are typically in attendance.

Many Egyptians do not distinguish between saints of different religions, and simply rank them. First are the family of Mohammed, then the Companions, the martyrs, holy men, and lastly, local saints who are not well known outside their villages.

===Iraq===
In Iraq, Muslims and Jews served alongside each other as keeps of shrines associated with saints and prophets. Both Muslims and Jews visited the shrine of Ezra and Ezekiel. 

Among the tombs and shrines frequented by Jews in Iraq are the shrine of Ezekiel and the tomb of Ezra (in the 11th century said to be surround by the graves of seven tzadikim). Special songs were composed and sung during the pilgrimage to the former. Pilgrims often left valuable books there in hopes they would be blessed with sons, and vows of lamp oil for the eternal light were made. Pilgrims also left purses of money at Ezekiel&#x27;s shrine for safekeeping until they returned from long travels. At one point there were also shrines for Daniel, Barukh ben Neriah, Rabbi Meir, and other Talmudic sages. 

===Lebanon===
In Lebanon, Karak Nuh hosts a tomb thought to be that of Noah, an identification dating back to the Medieval era.
===Morocco===
In Morocco, emphasis has been put on saint veneration&#x27;s similarities between Jewish and Muslim communities to different political ends. While these practices are indeed similar, and saints may be shared between communities, certain elements are uniquely Jewish. Saints and their icons are often likened to Torah scrolls and are physically treated in similar ways- the tomb of a saint is like a Torah&#x27;s ark, and the frames of icons are made with similar materials to Torah mantles. Pilgrimages also borrow elements from Torah services. Annual Jewish pilgrimages to tzadik&#x27;s tombs were called &quot;hillūla&quot;, meaning celebration.

Both Jews and Muslims held communal meals in the tomb sanctuary. Both attributed saints with the power to heal, do miracles, control nature, perform spiritual and ritual healing via trance, and control jinn. Tzadikim were also attributed to swnd messages in dreams, spirit forms, and while transformed into animals. Some of these traits are also similar to Christian saints, which likely influenced Iberian Judaism and was brought to Morocco by the expulsion of Jews from Spain.

The differences between the traditions include the fact that Muslim marabouts were recognized while alive, and were commonly related to, or were students or followers of, other holy figures. Tzadikim typically did not come from such holy lineages and were recognized after their deaths. Marabouts also often joined or were said to join anti-colonial resistance groups, while tzadikim did not.

Tzadikim in Morocco are typically Torah scholars, miracle workers, and divine mediators. Stories and poems written about them are done in the same style and tradition as other Rabbinic literature. They were usually Rabbis, which is not uncommon in the Jewish tzadik tradition. Many saints in both Judaism and Islam were localized and only worshipped in specific areas. Others gained widespread recognition. Jews believed their saints to be superior to Muslim saints, and sometimes viewed the Muslim worship and serving of the tzadikim as evidence of this.

The similarities of Moroccan Jewish and Muslim practices, including saint veneration, were used by colonial European powers to claim Morocco was unified and consisted of a distinct nation, but that Moroccans were not sufficiently united to resist imperialism. Today, these similarities are used to emphasize and display tolerance of religious minorities. In the colonial era, these overlaps and similarities led to positive economic relations in regard to saint veneration. The infrastructure introduced during colonialism increased the number of pilgrims for everyone, which increased their economies and the logistics for organizing them. The festive nature of Jewish pilgrimages in Morocco also increased during this time. Muslims often did the upkeep and protection of tombs, as the sultan would appoint them to protect the cemeteries of dhimmis. Today the government of Morocco continues to upkeep tombs and help organize and facilitate pilgrimages.

===Israel===
In Israel, the sites associated with tzadikim and other holy figures have become politically contentious. These sites were once frequented by all religions in the area, with varying personal beliefs about who was buried there, but following the creation of the State of Israel, Arabs, whether they are Muslim or otherwise, have often been banned from these sites. As such these sites are often at the center of violence.

===Syria===
Like in Morocco, Syrian Jews historically did not recognize living saints, while their Muslim neighbors did.

In Damascus, Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians would all visit the same tomb of a medieval Muslim saint (Shaykh Arslan), a sharing of holiness that was once common throughout Muslim majority countries.

Both the Medieval Jews and Muslims of Damascus believed the city would be the site of the coming of the Messiah at the end of time. Many sites in the city were given specific future roles in this, as well as being associated with various holy figures such as Abraham and Noah.

Some of the holy sites frequented by Jews in Syria throughout history include the Synagogue of Elijah in Damascus (which contained a shrine dedicated to Elijah as well), another shrine dedicated to Elijah in Jawbar, east of Damascus, the propurted Tomb of Ezra in Taduf near Aleppo, the shrine of Abraham in Kefar Avaraham (aka Barza) near Damascus, and several other shrines dedicated to Elijah throughout Syria. Abraham has been associated with Damascus as far back as Josephus&#x27;s writings, who recorded the belief that he had ruled Damascus as a king during some of his life.

==Terminology in Kabbalah==

===Identification with &quot;Yesod&quot;===

&quot;..For all that is in Heaven and on Earth..&quot;
&quot;-For &quot;all כל&quot; (Yesod) joins the Heaven and the Earth&quot;
&quot;The Tzadik is the foundation (Yesod) of the World&quot;

In the system of 10 Sephirot Divine emanations in Kabbalah, each of the 7 emotional expressions is related to an archetypal figure in the Hebrew Bible. The first emanated realm to emerge from God&#x27;s potential Will in Creation is Atziluth, the World of &quot;Emanation&quot;. As it is still nullified to Divinity, so not yet considered a self-aware existence, it is the realm where the 10 Sephirot attributes of God are revealed in their essence. In lower spiritual worlds the sephirot also shine, but only in successively lower degrees, concealed through successive contractions and veilings of the Divine vitality. Seven biblical tzadikim, righteous figures are considered as embodiments of the emotional sephirot of Atzilut: Abraham-Kindness, Isaac-Restraint, Jacob-Mercy, Moses-Endurance, Aaron-Glory, Joseph-Foundation, David-Kingship. While all seven figures are considered supreme Tzadikim, in particular contexts, either Joseph as &quot;Yesod&quot;, and Moses as inclusive soul of the community, are identified especially as archetypes for the Tzadik in general.

In the sephirot, Chesed-Abraham, Gevurah-Isaac and Tiferet-Jacob are higher spiritual powers than Yesod-Joseph, which channels the higher powers to their fulfilment in Malchut action. However, traditionally in Judaism, Joseph is referred to with the quality of &quot;Tzadik-Righteous&quot;. While the Patriarchs lived righteously as shepherds, Joseph remained holy in Egypt, surrounded by impurity, tested by Potiphar&#x27;s wife, captive in prison, and then active as viceroy to Pharaoh. As the Heavenly sephirah of Yesod-&quot;Foundation&quot; channels spirituality to our physical realm, so in Kabbalah and the further development in Hasidic thought, its function also parallels the human role of the Tzadik in this world:

* In the Divine, Yesod is the 9th Sefirah, in the middle balanced column, connecting all the higher sefirot, centred on Tiferet-&quot;Beautiful&quot; emotional harmony, to the last sefirah Malchut- realisation in &quot;Kingship&quot;. In the flow of Divine Creative lifeforce, this represents the connecting channel between Heaven and Earth, between the &quot;Holy One Blessed Be He&quot; (Tiferet Divine transcendent male manifestation of God), and the &quot;Shekhinah&quot; (Malkuth indwelling Divine immanent female presence of God). The 16th century Safed Kabbalists introduced the prayer &quot;For the sake of the union&quot; of these principles before Jewish observances.
* In the soul, Yesod is contact, connection and communication with outer reality of malchut, similar to the way the foundation of a building connects it with the earth.
* In the bodily form of man and woman, Yesod corresponds to the organ of procreation, analogously where the Tiferet body descends towards action, expressed in the procreative power to create life. This relates to the Circumcision &quot;Covenant of Abraham&quot;, the Jewish &quot;Sign of the Covenant&quot; with God. As the Torah describes two levels of Jewish covenant, physical &quot;covenant of circumcision&quot; and spiritual &quot;circumcision of the heart&quot;, so women are considered born already physically circumcised. Joseph&#x27;s resistance to Potiphar&#x27;s wife represents his perfection of the &quot;Sign of the Covenant&quot;. Yesod is the foundation of a person&#x27;s future generations, the power of generating infinity in the finite.
* Yesod is identified with the righteous tzadik, &quot;the tzadik is the foundation of the world&quot;. As Jewish mysticism describes different levels of Tzadik, Kabbalah sees this verse as particularly referring to the one perfect tzadik of the generation. In the tzadik, God&#x27;s infinite-transcendent light becomes manifest in this finite-immanent world. The tzadik procreates spiritually through revealing Divinity in new Torah interpretations, and through awakening return to God in his generation.
* Yesod connects beginning to end in God who encompasses all. In the Bible, Abraham began the Yesod covenant of circumcision, though his sefirah is Chesed love-kindness, the first emotional expression. Love creates the unity of spiritual covenant. For Abraham this descended into action, to become expressed in the physical covenant of circumcision. Yesod expresses this descent, uniting spiritual and physical. &quot;Foundation&quot; is the beginning of a building and the conclusion of planning. Yesod is the power to bring action to conclusion, to reveal that the beginning and end are united in God, &quot;the end is wedged in the beginning, and the beginning in the end&quot;.
* Each Sefirah contains an inner dimension, as a soul motivating its outer Kabbalistic emanation function. Hasidic thought explores the Divine motivation within, by psychologising Kabbalah through man&#x27;s experience. The inner motivation of Yesod is &quot;Emet&quot;-truth, each person&#x27;s desire for their actions to reflect their true soul intention, fulfilling in action God&#x27;s essential intention for Creation. The Tzadik experiences the wish for Divine purpose consummately.

===Intellect in the supernal soul of the community===

&quot;..To love the Lord your God, to listen to His voice, and to cleave to Him..&quot;
&quot;Cleaving to a Torah scholar is as cleaving to the Divine Shechinah&quot;
The leaders of Israel over the masses stem from the intellect of Adam&#x27;s soul
&quot;In every generation there is a leader like Moses&quot;

* The soul of the Tzadik is an inclusive, general soul of the community. In Kabbalah, gematria (numerical value) has significance, because Creation is formed through Divine &quot;speech&quot; as in Genesis 1. The gematria of Yesod (יסוד) is 80, 8 times 10, forming reduced value of 18 (חי Life), as a tzadik is called truly alive spiritually. 80 is the value of Klal (כלל), the &quot;community&quot;, the extension of Kol (כל), the term in Kabbalah for the sephirah of Yesod. The &quot;Tzadik of the generation&quot; is a &quot;general soul&quot; (neshama klalit) of the generation, in which each individual soul is included. Hasidic thought focuses on this parallel, and its application for each person. Through the personal connection of each soul to the tzadik, their &quot;Yechidah&quot; soul-essence becomes revealed, through the revelation of the &quot;Yechidah&quot; of the Tzadik.

====Breslov Hasidut====
Rebbe Nachman of Breslov explained how only a true leader can awaken the most genuine Jewish faith: this leader is the Tzadik.

<text>Walther Franz Anton von Dyck (6 December 1856 – 5 November 1934), born Dyck () and later ennobled, was a German mathematician. He is credited with being the first to define a mathematical group, in the modern sense in . He laid the foundations of combinatorial group theory, being the first to systematically study a group by generators and relations.

==Biography==

Von Dyck was a student of Felix Klein and served as chairman of the commission publishing Klein&#x27;s encyclopedia. Von Dyck was also the editor of Kepler&#x27;s works. He promoted technological education as rector of the Technische Hochschule of Munich. He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1908 at Rome.

Von Dyck is the son of the Bavarian painter Hermann Dyck.

==Legacy==
The Dyck language in formal language theory is named after him, as are Dyck&#x27;s theorem and Dyck&#x27;s surface in the theory of surfaces, together with the von Dyck groups, the Dyck tessellations, Dyck paths, and the Dyck graph.

<text>State Route 140 (SR 140) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California, 102 miles (164 km) in length. It begins in the San Joaquin Valley at Interstate 5 near Gustine, and runs east into Sierra Nevada, terminating in Yosemite National Park.

==Route description==

Heading east from I-5, the highway passes Gustine; it then jogs to cross the San Joaquin River. It roughly marks the southern edge of the farmable land around Livingston. It intersects with State Route 99 in Merced, which it overlaps for a few miles. Travelers coming from most regions of the San Francisco Bay Area or other parts of Northern California to Yosemite Valley and the southern portion of Yosemite would transfer from Highway 99 to Highway 140 at this point. For those coming from San Jose and the rest of the Silicon Valley, the most direct, fastest route is State Route 152 east; then the roads of Road 9, Bliss Road, Sandy Mush Road, and Plainsburg Road to reach Highway 140 in Planada. (Those going to the northern portion of Yosemite would have instead taken either I-580 and I-205 leaving the Bay Area, then State Route 120 east through Manteca, or State Route 132 east through Modesto.)

After exiting Highway 99, Highway 140 continues through Planada, after which the farmland gives way to grazing land. It is quite dry in the summer due to California&#x27;s Mediterranean climate, and the dry grass gives the landscape a golden color. Western meadowlarks, American kestrels, red-tailed hawks and turkey vultures are frequently glimpsed. A few blue oaks can be seen as the highway leaves the valley and begins to climb through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. They become more and more numerous as the elevation increases. As the highway passes through Catheys Valley the vegetation begins to diversify a little. California live oaks and ponderosa pines intermingle with the blue oaks as it nears Mariposa. In Mariposa, it briefly runs concurrently with State Route 49.

A ponderosa pine forest borders the highway on both sides as it passes through Midpines. As it approaches Briceburg, the roadway follows a steep, winding grade down to the Merced River valley. The highway then runs alongside the Merced River for about to the Yosemite National Park entrance, after passing through El Portal. The upper stretch of the Merced River valley below the park, which the highway follows, is designated as Wild and Scenic River Area. The area separates Sierra National Forest (south) and Stanislaus National Forest (north).

Inside Yosemite, state routes are federally maintained and are not included in the state route logs. The highway continues into the park as El Portal Drive, following the Merced River to Yosemite Valley. The road intersects with Big Oak Flat Road, providing a connection to State Route 120. El Portal Drive then splits into a one way loop road to connect the rest of the valley, heading east as Southside Drive on the south side of the river and then looping back west as Northside Drive on the north side of the river. State Route 41/Wawona Road intersects with Southside Drive just east of the split.

SR 140 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 140 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only the part of the road from Mariposa to El Portal is designated as a scenic highway.

==History==
The &quot;All-Weather Highway&quot; (now State Route 140) opened in 1926, ensuring year-long visitation and delivery of supplies under normal conditions.[74] NPS 1989, p. 113.
In June 2006, the road between El Portal and Mariposa was closed due to a rock slide. The Ferguson Slide buried about of SR140 between Cedar Lodge and Briceburg Visitor Center between SR-49 and SR-41.

A small detour opened in August, 2006, with a traffic light system to allow drivers to circumvent the original slide damage area.
Plans are underway for construction of a rock shed through the slide area to restore the original alignment.

The road was closed in 2018 due to the Ferguson Fire.

<text>The Battle of the Rails (French: La Bataille du rail) is a 1946 French war film directed by René Clément. It depicts the efforts by railway workers in the French Resistance to sabotage German military transport trains during the Second World War, particularly during the Invasion of Normandy by Allies. Many of the cast were genuine railway workers. While critics have often historically treated it as similar to Italian neorealism, it is closer to the traditional documentaries on which the director had worked.

The film was shown at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival where it won the &quot;Prix international du jury&quot; and Clément won the Best Director Award. The film also won the inaugural Prix Méliès. In 1949 the film was distributed in America by Arthur Mayer and Joseph Burstyn.

<doc id="752626" wikidata="Q890278" url="?curid=752626" title="Boerewors">
<text>Boerewors () is a type of sausage which originated in South Africa. It is an important part of South African, Zimbabwean cuisine and is popular across Southern Africa. The name is derived from the Afrikaans words (literally, a farmer) and (&#x27;sausage&#x27;). According to South African government regulation, boerewors must contain at least 90 percent meat or fat from beef, pork, lamb or goat. The other 10% is made up of spices and other ingredients. Not more than 30% of the meat content may be fat. Boerewors may not contain offal other than the casings, or any mechanically separated meat (as recovered through a process where meat and bone are mechanically separated).

==History==
Boerewors is made from coarsely minced beef, minced pork, lamb and or goat. When locally available antelopes such as springbok or oryx are included, the sausage must be labeled with the species from which the meat originates. It also contains spices (usually toasted coriander seed, black pepper, nutmeg, cloves and allspice). Like many other forms of sausage, boerewors may contain a high proportion of fat, and is preserved with salt and vinegar, and packed in edible sausage casings, which are the only part of the sausage which may be offal. Traditional boerewors is usually formed into a continuous spiral. It is often served with pap (traditional South African porridge / polenta made from mielie-meal). Boerewors is also very common throughout Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe as well as with expatriate South African communities worldwide.

===Guinness World Record===
On 3 May 2014, the Guinness World Record for braaing the longest boerewors in the world was broken in South Africa. The sausage measured in length. The boerewors was distributed freely to old-age homes and the Abraham Kriel Orphanage.

==Preparation==

Boerewors is most traditionally &quot;braaied&quot; (grilled over charcoal or wood), but is often cooked under an electric grill, or roasted in an oven, or fried in a pan. When cooking Boerewors, pricking the casing will lead to the sausage losing much of the moisture and fat during cooking. A local variant of the hot dog is the boerewors roll, or &quot;boerie&quot; roll, which is a piece of boerewors in a hot dog bun, often served with a tomato, chili and onion relish or chakalaka. Some people prefer boerewors stew which can be prepared with mash potatoes or pap.

==Variations==
The many varieties of boerewors include specialties such as garlic wors, &quot;kameeldoring&quot; (camel thorn), &quot;Karoowors&quot; (sausage from the Karoo region in South Africa), and &quot;spekwors&quot; (made with cubed pork fat). Other ingredients include cheese and chilli peppers.

A similar sausage may also be made from the meat of different animal species, such as kudu, and springbok, but it may not be sold as boerewors. Instead, it is named after the predominant meat species, but only if it contains at least 75% meat from that specific species. When a sausage is made from different types of game, it may not be labelled boerewors but must be labelled as game sausage and with the names of the game species in it.

Boerewors does not keep well unrefrigerated. A similar dried or cured sausage called droëwors is prepared instead in a process similar to the preparation of biltong. Droëwors has become popular in its own right as a snack.

In response to the modern plant-based food movement, various vegan boerewors substitutes, mostly made by small and home-based industries, have begun to appear in retailers and food markets in South Africa. They may not be labeled as boerewors.

==Competitions==
The preparation and grilling of boerewors has become a fine art with many local, regional and national competitions taking place. The Shoprite supermarket chain hosts an annual competition to determine the best new preparations. The winner of this competition has the privilege of having their product/recipe manufactured and sold in all Checkers stores nationwide, under the Championship Boerewors brand.

<doc id="752630" wikidata="Q510679" url="?curid=752630" title="Köprülüzade Fazıl Ahmed Pasha">
<text>Köprülüzade Fazıl Ahmed Pasha (, ; ; 1635 – 3 November 1676) was an Ottoman nobleman and statesman, who belonged to the renowned Köprülü family of Albanian origin, which produced six grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire.
== Life ==
He was born into the Köprülü family, the son of Köprülü Mehmed Pasha and Ayşe Hatun (Hanım), daughter of Yusuf Ağa. His father was an Ottoman general of &quot;devshirme&quot; origin who in 1656 became Grand Vizier, while his mother was the daughter of a notable originally from Kayacık, a village of Havza in Amasya. His maternal grandfather was a &quot;voyvoda&quot; (tax-farmer) who built a bridge in Kadegra, that because of this was renamed Köprü, where his father Mehmed was stationed, and to which the Köprülü family owes its name.

He served as grand vizier from 1661 to 1676 after he inherited the title from his father. Prior to this appointment, he served as the Ottoman governor of the Damascus Eyalet (1660 to 1661) and the Erzurum Eyalet (1659 to 1660).

He was dubbed &quot;Fazıl&quot;, meaning &quot;wise&quot; (from the Arabic &quot;fazilet&quot;, meaning &quot;wisdom&quot;), for reducing taxation and promoting education. On the other hand, he was brutal in war. He led the Ottoman Army in the Austro-Turkish War (1663–64) in which he intended to subdue Austria and to finally conquer Vienna itself. At the beginning of July 1664, he succeeded in destroying Novi Zrin in the northern part of the Kingdom of Croatia after nearly a month-long siege. Although defeated in the Battle of Saint Gotthard, he was able to gain territory by the Peace of Vasvár in 1664.

Following this treaty, he concentrated on the Cretan War and captured Candia (present-day Heraklion) from the Republic of Venice in 1669. At the end of the Polish–Ottoman War (1672–1676) against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, he signed the Treaty of Buchach in 1672 and the Treaty of Żurawno in 1676.

Contemporary European observers frequently remarked upon the atheistic tendencies of Fazıl Ahmed&#x27;s inner circle of courtiers, and particularly those of Fazıl Ahmed himself. Nevertheless, his exact religious views remain unknown.

Fazıl Ahmed Pasha died on November 3, 1676, from complications resulting from his lifestyle of heavy drinking.

<text>Isabel Emily Jay (17 October 1879 – 26 February 1927) was an English opera singer and actress, best known for her performances in soprano roles of the Savoy Operas with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company and in Edwardian musical comedies. During Jay&#x27;s career, picture postcards were immensely popular, and Jay was photographed for over 400 different postcards.

After studying at the Royal Academy of Music, Jay joined the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1897, with whom she began singing principal roles immediately, becoming the company&#x27;s leading soprano in 1899, where she played leading roles in comic operas including &quot;The Rose of Persia, The Pirates of Penzance, Patience, The Emerald Isle&quot; and &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. She married and left the company in 1902. She returned to the West End stage in 1903 and starred in eleven musicals over the ensuing years, including &quot;A Country Girl, The Cingalee, Véronique, The White Chrysanthemum, The Girl Behind the Counter, Miss Hook of Holland, King of Cadonia&quot; and &quot;The Balkan Princess&quot;. She retired in 1911 at age 31.

==Life and career==

===Early life and D&#x27;Oyly Carte years===
Jay was born in Wandsworth, London, the youngest child of John Wimburn Jay, an insurance officer, and his wife Isabelle Clara (Wicks). She was the great-granddaughter of John George Henry Jay (1770–1849), a musician and composer connected with the Royal Academy of Music. She began to sing in public at the age of twelve. She entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1895, where she studied piano and voice. In 1897, she was the first winner of the Gilbert R. Betjemann gold medal for operatic singing. While still at the Academy, she drew the attention of Helen Carte.
On leaving the Academy, in 1897, she joined the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company with a week-long trial at the Savoy Theatre, singing the part of Elsie Maynard in the first London revival of &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;. She immediately became principal soprano in a D&#x27;Oyly Carte touring company, playing the roles of Elsie, Phyllis in &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, Yum-Yum in &quot;The Mikado&quot;, Princess Lucilla Chloris in &quot;His Majesty&quot;, and later adding the roles of Aline in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, and Mabel in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;The Era&quot; wrote of her Mabel: &quot;Miss Isabel Jay&#x27;s bright, alert acting and fascinating personality would have condoned many deficiencies. But in addition to winning all hearts by her freshness and earnestness, Miss Jay gave us a delightfully easy and accomplished rendering of her share of the score, and the way in which she used a very valuable voice told of sound training and keen intelligence.&quot;

Jay rejoined the main D&#x27;Oyly Carte company at the Savoy in 1898, briefly playing Gianetta and then Casilda in &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, and soon took over the role of The Plaintiff in &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, winning a favourable review in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In early 1899, she created the small role of Aloës in &quot;The Lucky Star&quot;, and she then filled in for Ruth Vincent for 21 performances as Josephine in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, as well as performing again as The Plaintiff.

===Principal soprano===
Late in 1899, Vincent left the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, turning down the secondary role in &quot;The Rose of Persia&quot; when she was passed over to sing the lead, Sultana Zubeydah, which was given to Ellen Beach Yaw. Jay was initially given the small role of Blush-of-Morning. Less than two weeks later, when Yaw was dismissed, Jay was promoted to the demanding lead role and received favourable notices as the Sultana.
Now the company&#x27;s leading soprano, Jay played Mabel in &quot;Pirates&quot; (1900), again earning good notices, and the title role in the first London revival of &quot;Patience&quot; (1901). During the run, she was made an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music. She then created the roles of Lady Rose Pippin in &quot;The Emerald Isle&quot; (1901) and the Gipsy Woman in &quot;Ib and Little Christina&quot; (1901). She played Phyllis in the first London revival of &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1901–1902). She left the company in 1902 to marry the African explorer Henry Shepherd Cavendish, who was later the 6th Baron Waterpark.

===West End career===
After the birth of her first daughter, Celia Mitchell Anderson (1903–1997), Jay returned to the stage, taking over the role of Marjory Joy in a hit production of &quot;A Country Girl&quot;. She then starred in one West End theatre production after another – eleven in all – over a period of seven-and-a-half years. The first was the hit musical &quot;The Cingalee&quot; (1904, with Rutland Barrington and Hayden Coffin), in which she created the role of Lady Patricia Vane. In 1905 she was invited to sing before King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra at Chatsworth House, where the Queen presented her with a brooch. She was also a replacement for a pregnant Ruth Vincent in the title role of &quot;Véronique&quot;.

Later that year she was hired by Frank Curzon, a successful theatre manager, who became her mentor. Her first role with Curzon was Sybil Cunningham in &quot;The White Chrysanthemum&quot; at the Criterion in 1905 (starring with Rutland Barrington and Henry Lytton) and then on tour. In early 1906, Jay separated from her husband. Her next role was Winnie Willoughby in &quot;The Girl Behind the Counter&quot; (1906, with Hayden Coffin). For the next four years, she starred regularly in Curzon&#x27;s West End productions, often at The Prince of Wales Theatre and often in a show written by Paul Rubens. These were intended to be spectacular shows, with exotic sets, elaborate costumes and beautiful chorus girls. Her roles during these years included Olivia in Liza Lehmann&#x27;s &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; (1906, based on the novel of the same name), Sally in &quot;Miss Hook of Holland&quot; (1906, running for a very successful 462 performances), Paulette in &quot;My Mimosa Maid&quot; (1908), Princess Marie in &quot;King of Cadonia&quot; (1908), Christina in &quot;Dear Little Denmark&quot; (1909), and Princess Stephanie in &quot;The Balkan Princess&quot; (1910).
Jay and Curzon married on 28 July 1910. After the end of the run of &quot;The Balkan Princess&quot; in 1911, Jay retired from the stage at only 31 years of age, and she had a second child, Pamela Stephanie Curzon, in 1915. In 1923 in her only return to the stage, Jay created the role of Anne West, with Curzon as suitor James Hathaway and daughter Celia in her stage debut as Angela West, in a play of Jay&#x27;s own authorship, &quot;The Inevitable&quot;. The play toured Hastings, Eastbourne, Littlehampton and Brighton, before opening for a short run at the St. James Theatre. During her career, more than 400 different postcards with Jay&#x27;s image were issued.

===Early death===
Jay&#x27;s health began to deteriorate due to the effects of scarlet fever as a child, and she died at age 47 in Monte Carlo, having been on a cruise with her husband. In recognition of her achievements, the Royal Academy of Music two years later instituted the Isabel Jay Memorial Prize.

==Recordings==
Jay made 19 recordings between 1900 and 1906, mostly of pieces from her early musical comedies. She also recorded &quot;Poor Wand&#x27;ring One&quot; from &quot;Pirates&quot; in 1900 and twice more in 1904. One of the latter recordings is heard on the Pearl recording &quot;The Art of the Savoyard.&quot;

<doc id="752645" wikidata="Q512707" url="?curid=752645" title="Köprülüzade Fazıl Mustafa Pasha">
<text>Köprülüzade Fazıl Mustafa Pasha (&quot;Köprülü Mustafa Pasha the Wise&quot;, also known as Gazi Fazıl Mustafa Köprülü (; ) 1637 – 19 August 1691, Slankamen) served as the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire from 1689 to 1691, when the Empire was engaged in a war against the Holy League countries in the Great Turkish War. He was the son of Ayşe Hatun, of Turkish origin, and of Köprülü Mehmed Pasha. He was thus a member of the Köprülü family of Albanian origin through his father. His father, his elder brother Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha, as well as his two brothers-in-law (Kara Mustafa Pasha and Abaza Siyavuş Pasha) were former grand viziers. His epithet &quot;Fazıl&quot; means &quot;wise&quot; in Ottoman Turkish.

==Rise to Power==
He was the son of Köprülü Mehmed Pasha, an Albanian Vizier of the Ottoman Empire and the founder of the Köprülü family, and of Ayşe Hatun. The daughter of a notable originally from Kayacık, a village in Havza in Amasya. His parents met when his father was stationed in Köprü, formerly Kadegra, which got its name thanks to his maternal grandfather, who built a bridge () there. He became a member of the Sultan&#x27;s guards and spent much of his time on military campaigns with his brother Fazıl Ahmed. Thanks to his brother-in-law, grand vizier Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha, Fazıl Mustafa became the seventh vizier in the imperial council, and by 1683 he had risen to third vizier. After Kara Mustafa was defeated at Vienna, Fazıl Mustafa was sent away from Istanbul. In 1687 an army rebellion made his brother-in-law Abaza Siyavuş Pasha grand vizier and forced sultan Mehmed IV to abdicate in favor of his brother Süleyman II. Fazıl Mustafa apparently was closely involved in Mehmed IV&#x27;s dethronement and rose to second vizier. Factional politics soon resulted in his exile from the capital, and he was only saved from execution by the grace of the şeyhülislam. Until 1689, Fazıl Mustafa served as commander of Chios and the Cretan cities of Khania and Iráklion.

==Grand Vizierate==
After the Austrian victory at The Second Battle of Mohács, sultan Suleiman II was persuaded to appoint Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha as his grand vizier on 25 October 1689.

Like his relatives, Fazıl Mustafa Pasha was a skilled administrator and military commander. He followed his father&#x27;s footsteps by having corrupt government/military officials from the previous sultanate removed and executed. They were replaced with men loyal to Fazıl Mustafa Pasha, who also aided the treasury by implementing strict military rolls, thereby preventing soldiers from collecting the salaries of their deceased comrades. He also proclaimed a general military mobilization of Muslim subjects and drafted Kurdish and Yörük tribesmen, thus increasing the number of conscripts.

Other reforms eased the burden of the Empire&#x27;s non-military subjects. Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha reformed the poll tax, paid by the empire&#x27;s non-Muslim subjects, by restoring the policy of having taxes collected on individual adults (instead of collective assessment, which harmed communities whose populations had decreased due to war and other factors). Fazıl Mustafa Pasha also made it easier to issue permits to fix or rebuild Christian churches.

Having suffered from factionalism in the court and government, Fazıl Mustafa Pasha attempted to limit the number of viziers in the imperial council. To combat the abuse of power of local and regional authorities, he set up councils of notables in the provinces, modeling these on the imperial government. The far-reaching effects of his administrative reforms would last for decades.

==Military successes, disaster, and death==
The course of the ongoing Great Turkish War worsened when Russia began its involvement and formally joined an alliance of European powers by launching the devastating Crimean campaigns. Under Fazıl Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s leadership the Ottomans halted an Austrian advance into Serbia and crushed an uprising in Bulgaria.

Fazıl Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s 1690 campaign brought further success, with the recapture of Niš, Vidin, Smederevo, and Golubac. He then besieged Belgrade, using 40,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry. On 8 October, after the defenders’ armory was destroyed in an explosion, the Habsburg commander capitulated. The recapture of Belgrade, originally conquered by the Ottomans in 1521 but lost to the Habsburgs in 1688, gave hope to the Ottomans that their military disasters of the 1680s, including the losses of Hungary and Transylvania, could be reversed.

The hope proved deceptive. On 19 August 1691, Fazıl Mustafa Pasha was struck in the forehead by a bullet at the Battle of Slankamen (northwest of Belgrade). The Ottomans suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of Ludwig Wilhelm von Baden, the commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army in Hungary, nicknamed &quot;Türkenlouis&quot; (Louis the Turk) for his victories. Called &quot;the bloodiest battle of the century&quot; by contemporaries, the defeat at Slankemen cost the lives of 20,000 men and the Ottoman&#x27;s most capable military commander.

Fazıl Mustafa Pasha was the fifth member of the Köprülü family to serve as grand vizier. After his death, the Ottoman Empire suffered further defeats. By 1695, the Ottomans were left with only one piece of territory in Hungary.

<text>René Louiche Desfontaines (14 February 1750 – 16 November 1833) was a French botanist.

Desfontaines was born near Tremblay in Brittany. He attended the Collège de Rennes and in 1773 went to Paris to study medicine. His interest in botany originated from lectures at the Jardin des Plantes given by Louis Guillaume Lemonnier. He excelled in his new interest and was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1783. He was also a member of the Académie Nationale de Médecine.

Desfontaines spent two years in Tunisia and Algeria, returning with a large collection of plants. He wrote &quot;Flora Atlantica&quot; (1798–1799, 2 vols), which included 300 genera new to science.

In addition, he worked also on ornithology, and presented the findings of his expeditions to Africa for one of the &quot;Memoires de L&#x27;Académie Royale des Sciences&quot;. Although the &quot;Mémoire&quot; corresponds to the year 1787, it was not published until 1789 by L&#x27;Imprimerie Royal as part of the &quot;Histoire de L&#x27;Académie Royale de Sciences&quot;. The convulsions of the French Revolution may have made the access to the text so scarce that in 1880 the ornithologist Alfred Newton republished the original text under the title &quot;Desfontaines&#x27;s Mémoire sur quelques nouvelles espèces d&#x27;oiseaux des côtes de Barbarie&quot; on behalf of the Willughby Society of London.

In 1786, he was appointed professor of botany at the Jardin des Plantes, replacing Lemonnier. He later became director of the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, was one of the founders of the Institut de France, president of the Academy of Sciences, and elected to the Légion d’honneur. During the French Revolution he was appointed to the Commission Temporaire des Arts where he shaped a new vision of Natural History.

Desfontaines established a herbarium, known as the &quot;Flora Atlantica&quot;, which has 1480 specimens and contains many type specimens for Mediterranean species. It was left to the City of Paris after his death.

The genera &quot;Desfontainia&quot; and &quot;Fontanesia&quot; are named for this author.

The standard author abbreviation Desf. is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name.

<doc id="752652" wikidata="Q666160" url="?curid=752652" title="Quercus douglasii">
<text>Quercus douglasii, known as blue oak, is a species of oak endemic to California, common in the Coast Ranges and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. It is California&#x27;s most drought-tolerant deciduous oak, and is a dominant species in the blue oak woodland ecosystem. It is occasionally known as mountain oak and iron oak.

==Description==
&quot;Quercus douglasii&quot; is a medium-sized tree with sparse foliage, generally tall, with a trunk in diameter at breast height. Trunks are typically solitary, but some trees have multiple trunks. The tallest recorded specimen was found in Alameda County, at . The trees grow slowly, about per year. Individual trees over 500 years old have been recorded.

The bark is light gray with many medium-sized dark cracks. The blue-green leaves are tough and leathery, deciduous, long, and entire or shallowly lobed. The acorns are long, with a moderately sweet kernel, and mature in 6–7 months from pollination.

&quot;Q. douglasii&quot; is monoecious and wind-pollinated. Flower buds take a growing season to develop into catkins. Blue oak pollen is severely allergenic.

== Taxonomy ==
The species is one of over 80 named after Scottish botanist David Douglas. The common name &quot;blue oak&quot; derives from the dark blue-green tint of its leaves.

Taxonomically it is placed in the white oak group (subgenus &quot;Quercus&quot;, section &quot;Quercus&quot;).

== Ecology ==
&quot;Q. douglasii&quot; prefers dry to moist soil and plenty of sunlight. Its sparse foliage allows more light to reach the ground, and young trees may grow for decades below their parents&#x27; canopies. The species often co-habitates with gray pine (&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;), and is also found with interior live oak (&quot;Q. wislizeni&quot;), coast live oak (&quot;Q. agrifolia&quot;), valley oak (&quot;Q. lobata&quot;), Oregon white oak (&quot;Q. garryana&quot;), and canyon live oak (&quot;Q. chrysolepis&quot;). Natural hybrids between &quot;Q. douglasii&quot; and the related &quot;Q. lobata&quot;, &quot;Q. garryana&quot;, and shrub live oak (&quot;Q. turbinella&quot;) often occur where the species grow together in the same area. Sources consider &quot;Quercus × alvordiana&quot; to be a hybrid of &quot;Q. douglasii&quot; and either &quot;Q. turbinella&quot; or &quot;Q. john-tuckeri&quot;.

Old-growth blue oak woodland may be one of the most widespread old-growth forest ecosystems remaining in the state after European colonization.

The acorns are eaten by wildlife and livestock.

===Drought tolerance===
&quot;Quercus douglasii&quot; is the most drought-tolerant of California&#x27;s deciduous oaks. It has a smaller canopy than less drought-tolerant relatives, and invests proportionally more growth into roots rather than leaves throughout its life cycle. The leathery blue-green leaves contribute to its drought resistance; during drought, the leaf color is more pronounced. Trees can also drop their leaves in summer rather than fall in dry years, but usually continue to develop their acorns through the fall. Drought may cause trees not to flower in spring.

===Gall wasps===
Author Ron Russo writes that &quot;Q. douglasii&quot; hosts the &quot;largest number of known species&quot; of gall wasps, at more than 50. The wasps trigger the formation of oak galls in a wide variety of shapes, colors, and sizes.

===Sudden oak death resistance===
As of 2002, the disease known as sudden oak death, caused by the oomycete &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;, had not been found in &quot;Quercus douglasii&quot; or any members of the white oak group. An experiment showed that &quot;Q. douglasii&quot; and &quot;Q. lobata&quot; (another white oak) appeared to be resistant to the pathogen.

==Uses==

The acorns can be eaten but, if bitter, may need to have the tannins leached. Native Californians commonly gathered the acorns, which they considered good-tasting, and processed them into acorn flour. They made baskets out of blue oak seedlings, utensils such as bowls from the wood, and dye from the acorns. Commercially, the blue oak is mainly limited to use as firewood.

Just around the tiger&#x27;s leap, there is a small waterfall active only during the monsoon. It serves the purpose of relaxing in the water better than Bushi Dam, as the force of the fall is higher. Also, after the brief steep descent, the fall becomes a stream with a fair amount of force to go all the way down to the base of the Tiger&#x27;s Leap. Adventurers can trek down the stream whilst intermittently stepping back on land where the water current is too strong and the fall is steep.

<text>Bron () is a commune in the Metropolis of Lyon, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, eastern France.

== Geography ==
Bron lies east-southeast of central Lyon. It is the sixth-largest suburb of the city of Lyon, and is adjacent to its east side.

=== Climate ===

==History==
The earliest traces of life in Bron can be found in the cemetery and date from 71 BC. The town as it is today did not take shape until approximately 1812.

In mid-August 1944, prisoners from Montluc prison were taken to Bron Airfield where 109 of them, including 72 Jews, were killed in the , which would become known as &quot;Le Charnier de Bron&quot; (&quot;The Charnel house of Bron&quot;).

Bron was spared much of the damage caused by the riots in many of France&#x27;s suburbs in the 1990s, such as in Vénissieux and Villeurbanne.

==Administration==
The municipal council is composed of 43 members elected for a six-year term. The mayor are elected by the councilors.

==Sights==
The Fort de Bron, erected between 1872 and 1876, is part of the second belt of fortifications around Lyon.

==Population==

==Transport==
Bron is served by the following TCL (Lyon public transport) services:

*Metro
** Line D (Gare de Vaise to Gare de Vénissieux) – served by 2 stations ( and ) located on the boundary with Lyon.
*Tram

<text>An eye chart is a chart used to measure visual acuity comprising lines of optotypes in ranges of sizes. Optotypes are the letters or symbols shown on an eye chart. Eye charts are often used by health care professionals, such as optometrists, physicians and nurses, to screen persons for vision impairment. Ophthalmologists, physicians who specialize in the eye, also use eye charts to monitor the visual acuity of their patients in response to various therapies such as medications or surgery.

The chart is placed at a standardized distance away from the person whose vision is being tested. The person then attempts to identify the optotypes on the chart, starting with the larger ones and continuing with progressively smaller ones until the person cannot identify the optotypes. The size of the smallest optotypes that can be reliably identified is considered the person&#x27;s visual acuity.

The Snellen chart is the most widely used. Alternative types of eye charts include the logMAR chart, Landolt C, E chart, Lea test, Golovin–Sivtsev table, the Rosenbaum chart, and the Jaeger chart. Eye charts do not provide doctors with information on eye diseases such as glaucoma, problems with the retina, or loss of peripheral vision. 

== History ==
The concept of using eye glasses in order to improve eyesight has been prevalent since the late thirteenth century. As science progressively improved, reputable doctors within the ophthalmology field like Franciscus Cornelius Donders began to describe a clear definition as to what should be done in order to improve impairments of a patient&#x27;s vision. Although it slowly became clear which procedures benefitted patients, there was no uniform test to document impairment and improvement in someone&#x27;s vision. Around this time, the knowledge within the field of ophthalmology grew immensely. 

To measure visual acuity, in 1835 German ophthalmologist, Heinrich Küchler, made the first eye chart consisting of pictures of objects of decreasing size that patients were to identify. In 1843, he published another chart comprising alphabetic letters . In 1854, Austrian ophthalmologist, Eduard Jaeger created a chart comprising paragraphs with decreasing font sizes to test near vision acuity. In 1862, the then most effective and popular chart to test visual acuity was published by Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen. Snellen was Donders&#x27; first assistant. 

Because of Donders&#x27; fame and Snellen&#x27;s natural talent towards the field of ophthalmology, many doctors were enticed to visit in order to share ideas with them in Utrecht. As he worked closely through his practice, Snellen created his own chart that measured visual acuity. Snellen&#x27;s eye chart became the first of its type, hence it being the most scientifically reliable design in order to test vision distance in that time period. Snellen&#x27;s success within his charts was because they differed from past models that measured visual acuity. His chart varied the sizes of stimuli. Snellen&#x27;s eye chart opened the door to testing visual acuity, hence it became the global standard. 

The high demand for this chart was everywhere. Even Japanese ophthalmologist Ema Tenko, who studied under Snellen, created an eye chart that was used in Japan. Because of the creation of eye charts, examinations like vision screening (roughly beginning in 1899) within schools took place in order to test children&#x27;s eyes.

==Procedure==
Charts display several rows of optotypes, which are standardized symbols for testing vision. Optotypes are usually letters, numbers, or geometric symbols. Each row of the chart depicts optotypes of a different size. Typically the largest optotypes are in the top row. The optotypes become progressively smaller towards the bottom of the chart.

The person removes any glasses or contact lenses, and stands or sits a standardized distance from the chart (e.g., 20 feet for the Snellen chart). The person is then asked to identify the optotypes on the chart, starting with large rows and continuing to smaller rows until the optotypes cannot be reliably identified any more. The row in which the person can reliably identify symbols defines the visual acuity.

One eye is tested at a time. Practically, this is accomplished by covering the other eye with a hand, piece of paper, or a small paddle. After testing without glasses or contact lenses, testing is repeated while the person wears them, if applicable. Often, the use of such refractive lenses will correct visual acuity to normal. Refractive error can be corrected using a pinhole occluder. If the visual acuity improves with the use of pinholes, refractive lenses can be utilized to improve visual acuity. Squinting can achieve the same effect as a pinhole occluder.

With the Snellen chart, the visual acuity is recorded as a fraction with 20 in the numerator (top number) and values ranging from 10 to 600 in the denominator (bottom number). The denominator indicates the distance in feet at which a person with normal vision could stand to correctly identify the same symbols identified by the person tested. For example, a visual acuity of 20/20 is considered normal.

==Variations==
Numerous types of eye charts exist and are used in various situations. For example, the Snellen chart is designed for use at 6 meters or 20 feet, and is thus appropriate for testing distance vision, while the ETDRS chart is designed for use at 4 meters. There is often also a need to test a subject&#x27;s vision at near or occupational tasks (such as reading or computer use). For these situations, a Rosenbaum chart or Jaeger chart can be used.

While the Snellen chart remains the default, some authors have argued that the logMAR chart is superior. The logMAR chart presents the same number of symbols on each line, uses a typeface with letters that are equally legible at various sizes, and by varying the symbol size logarithmically, it is easier to use at nonstandard distances. As a consequence of these improvements, the logMAR chart has been proposed as a more reliable tool for measuring visual acuity.

It can be difficult to measure visual acuity in infants, young children, and illiterate adults. Special eye charts such as Lea Symbols can be used. One version uses simple pictures or patterns. Others are printed with the block letter &quot;E&quot; turned in different orientations, the so-called Tumbling E. The patient simply indicates which direction each &quot;E&quot; is facing. The Landolt C chart is similar: rows have circles with different segments missing, and the test-taker describes where each broken piece is located. The last two kinds of charts also reduce the possibility of the patient guessing the images.

Parents and caregivers may test their child&#x27;s eyesight from home to identify potential vision problems that require an eye care professional. Testing a child age three and older can be accomplished using the Tumbling E chart to play the &quot;pointing game&quot;. For this test, the child sits in a chair 10 feet from the chart, gently holding an eye cover over one eye. The parent or caregiver points to each E, starting with the largest E. The child then points in the direction the E is facing (up, down, left, right). The smallest line with Es identified by the child can be recorded. The various directions the E can face should be reviewed with the child prior to home testing. Home tests are not as accurate as exams conducted by professional ophthalmologists. At home eye tests should not replace a visit to a professional eye care physician.

==Alternatives==
Computer-based alternatives to the eye chart have been developed, but are not very common prior to smart phones with high display resolution and DPI becoming popular. They have several potential advantages, such as a more precise measurement, less examiner-induced bias and randomized optotypes. 

Computer-based alternatives to traditional eye charts also incorporate innovative technologies that enhance testing accuracy. The &quot;Eye Chart App&quot; utilize sensors to measure the viewing distance of the user. This capability allows the software to automatically calibrate the display of the eye chart according to the measured distance.

If the person, particularly a young child, is unable to cooperate with visual acuity testing via an eye chart, practitioners can be alerted to possible deficits in visual acuity by asking parents whether the child appears to see well. A clue is that the child may hold objects close to the face when attempting to focus. Refractive error can be estimated via photography, a technique called photoscreening.

==Technical details==
===Optotype Crowding===
Research has shown that optotype &quot;crowding&quot; reduces visual acuity at the fovea (as opposed to &quot;eccentric&quot; visual acuity) once the optotype characters are closer than 4.4 bar widths apart. This is referred to as the &quot;critical spacing&quot; for optotype letters at the fovea. For periphery visual acuity, the critical spacing is much greater, such that optotype characters closer than 15-20 bar widths apart negatively affect visual acuity.

<doc id="752678" wikidata="Q2349973" url="?curid=752678" title="Vincent Valentine">
<text>is a character in Square&#x27;s (now Square Enix) 1997 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. He is designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and also appears in various titles from the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, a metaseries set in the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; continuity. He is the protagonist of the 2006 third-person shooter &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot; and its mobile phone tie-in &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Lost Episode&quot;. Vincent is voiced in Japanese by Shōgo Suzuki and in English by Steven Blum and Matthew Mercer.

In the backstory to &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Vincent is a Turk assigned to guard the scientist Lucrecia Crescent, whom he falls in love with. After a series of scientific experiments involving the cells of the extraterrestrial lifeform Jenova, Crescent gives birth to the game&#x27;s antagonist, Sephiroth, with Hojo being the father. Soon after, Vincent became a test subject to experiments performed by Hojo after he shot him. This resulted in genetic modification that supplanted other forms within him and gave him superior strength, speed, and healing in addition to not aging. If the player unlocks Vincent, he will join Cloud Strife&#x27;s group to stop Sephiroth and seek revenge on Hojo.

Due to time constraints, Vincent was originally not intended to be playable in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, but was ultimately made an optional character. Despite his optional status and lack of concrete detail regarding his background, he proved to be popular with both fans and critics, and his history was expanded upon in other installments of the &quot;Compilation&quot;, primarily &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot; and &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;.

==Concept and design==
Character designer Tetsuya Nomura explained that Vincent&#x27;s character shifted from that of horror researcher to detective, to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase was in charge of the cutscene, in which Vincent joined the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima struggled with writing Vincent&#x27;s dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced similarly but had a handsome and sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud&#x27;s group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo but was unaware of the results of the experimentation he was subjected to. Additionally, he would be privy to information regarding Shinra&#x27;s involvement with the creation of Sephiroth. He would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth&#x27;s origins. When the game was in development, Nomura and his staff considered removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi since they did not have enough time to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately became optional party members.

Vincent&#x27;s Japanese voice actor, Shōgo Suzuki, explained that he tries &quot;to hold back as much emotion as possible when playing Vincent&quot;, noting that Vincent is &quot;a bit of a loner&quot; and &quot;appears cold on the surface&quot;. Nomura wanted Cloud and Vincent&#x27;s voices to contrast with each other due to their similar personalities. He felt Vincent was older and more mature than Cloud, and as a result, he cast Suzuki, who has a very low voice. In the English dub, Vincent was voiced by Steve Blum, as the casting staff wanted a man who portrays Vincent&#x27;s brooding manner based on his dark past. Blum was overjoyed because he claims to be a fan of the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and stated that directors wanted him to portray Vincent as &quot;dark and moody&quot; since Vincent is a &quot;tortured soul&quot;.

Vincent is a tall, lean man with long black hair and red eyes who wears a ragged red cloak and mantle over black underclothes, as well as a metallic, golden gauntlet on his left forearm. Vincent&#x27;s cloak covers the lower half of his face and is held closed by a series of buckles. His crimson cloak was added to symbolize the idea of him carrying a heavyweight connected to death. While other characters were given simple costumes in &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Vincent was given a more complex outfit. Nomura felt that changing his design to something complicated would &quot;conflict with his personality&quot;, which is relatively straightforward. So he was given attire consisting of &quot;various, complex parts&quot;. His cloak was difficult to animate due to it being organic; the overall complexity of Vincent&#x27;s design led to his scenes being &quot;especially hard to create&quot;. These scenes were constantly being adjusted so as &quot;to convey [their] elusive nature of seemingly having shape, but not&quot;. These adjustments concluded six months before the film&#x27;s completion.

Vincent was chosen as the protagonist of &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; due to his strong connections to the setting of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and the potential for expanding on his background. Due to the staff&#x27;s desire to make &quot;Dirge&quot; a shooter, Vincent was also chosen because of his weaponry, while his transformations into different monsters in the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was something the staff wanted to work into the gameplay. For the game, Nomura redesigned Vincent&#x27;s gun in the same way that Cloud&#x27;s Buster Sword was redesigned for &quot;Advent Children&quot;, to demonstrate that he is the protagonist of the game. The gun was named in reference to the monster from Greek and Roman mythology; the gun has three barrels, like how Cerberus has three heads.

== Appearances ==
===&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
In the game, Vincent is an optional party member. Players can unlock Vincent by the halfway point of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, when Cloud Strife and his allies find him sleeping in a coffin in the basement of Shinra Mansion in Nibelheim. Cloud mentions his quest to stop the game&#x27;s antagonist, Sephiroth, who Vincent recognizes as the son of Lucrecia Crescent. Vincent joins the group after learning that they may eventually meet up with Hojo, whom he has an unexplained vendetta against. Later, Vincent finds Lucrecia inside a cave, and his backstory is partly revealed. Vincent was a member of the Turks, an elite group of Shinra agents. While serving as Lucrecia&#x27;s bodyguard, he fell in love with her, but she ultimately decided to remain faithful to Hojo, who persuaded her to use her unborn baby in his experiments. When protesting the nature of these experiments, Vincent was shot by Hojo, who began to experiment on him. This resulted in him not aging and having the ability to transform into various monsters. Vincent felt strong guilt over being unable to protect Lucrecia, leading to his separation. Overcome by guilt, Lucrecia sealed herself away in a Mako crystal. Upon entering the cave in the game, Lucrecia is revived and asks Vincent if Sephiroth is still alive, but he lies and tells her that he is dead.

===&quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
In &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, which is set six years prior to &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Vincent is seen in his Turk attire conversing with Veld, the leader of the Turks, and helps him obtain some Materia needed for a mission. In the film &quot;Advent Children&quot;, which is set two years after &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Vincent rescues Cloud from Kadaj and his gang and reveals to him Kadaj&#x27;s intentions to merge with the remaining Jenova cells and resurrect Sephiroth. Vincent later helps Cloud and his allies defeat the summoned creature Bahamut SIN. In the &quot;On the Way to a Smile&quot; novella &quot;Case of Nanaki&quot;, which is set between the original game and &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Vincent encounters his former comrade, Red XIII (Nanaki), who is fearful that he will soon be alone due to his lifespan being much longer than humans. Vincent explains to Red that he is immortal and promises to meet with him every year to prevent his loneliness.

In &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;, which takes place one year after &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Vincent is seen working with Reeve Tuesti and the World Regenesis Organization to eliminate the organization Deepground, who have targeted Vincent because he carries inside his body, with Lucrecia having implanted it in him after he was shot by Hojo. The purpose of the Protomateria was to enable Vincent to control the gene, which Lucrecia injected him with to save his life. The Protomateria is eventually ripped from his body by Rosso the Crimson, leading to Vincent being unable to control Chaos. Eventually, he confronts the Deepground leader, Weiss the Immaculate, who is possessed by the digitalized mind of Hojo. Hojo reveals that his plan is to awaken Omega WEAPON, who will absorb the Lifestream and leave the Planet, resulting in the death of all living things. After Omega&#x27;s awakening, the renegade Deepground member, Shelke, returns the Protomateria to Vincent, and he is once again able to control Chaos, using it to destroy both Hojo and Omega. The mobile game &quot;Dirge of Cerberus Lost Episode&quot; takes place during &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; and features Vincent as the protagonist.

He appears in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Outside the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; series, Vincent appears in the fighting game &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot; as an unlockable character, with his Turk uniform as an alternate costume. Like the other &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; characters in the game, Vincent does not serve a role in the main storyline. Although he was meant to appear in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, his design was instead used as the basis for Cloud&#x27;s redesign. Vincent&#x27;s popularity has seen merchandise related to the character, including the release of action figures. Vincent also appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a spirit.

==Reception==

The character has received mixed comments from video game publications. Magazines have also described him as one of the best &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character. In &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s article &quot;The History of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;&quot;, Vincent was comically referred to as the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; character who female players found to be &quot;the most alluring undead man they&#x27;ve ever met&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; has praised for his &quot;striking&quot; character design, as well as the fact that &quot;&quot;FFVII&quot;&#x27;s 3D engine made his shapeshifting Limit Breaks some surprisingly scary stuff&quot;. He has been held as an example of the recurring character categories of &quot;The Kickass Quiet Guy&quot; by &quot;1UP.com&quot; and &quot;The Brooding Pretty Boy&quot; by &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;. DiehardgameFan said that Vincent&#x27;s design is invoking of vampires but does not pass such standards that gaming vampires are famous for as he is instead called an undead or an experiment.

There was also commentary about Vincent&#x27;s appearances in his spin-off. &quot;GameSpot&quot; writer Greg Mueller regarded Vincent as one of &quot;the more interesting characters from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;&quot; and liked how &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; was focused on him and explained his origins more clearly. His character design and abilities have been praised by &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Justin Speer, who felt that with such traits he &quot;capably steps into a leading role&quot; of &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jeremy Dunham had a similar opinion, noting that Vincent &quot;is exposed pretty convincingly here&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Rob Fahey criticized Vincent for not being familiar enough to players, even to those who played the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, to warrant his role as protagonist in &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;. However, Fahey still recognized him as a very popular character, commenting that he is one of the most common characters from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; to be featured in fan fiction and fan art. Although &quot;RPGamer&quot;″s Michael &quot;CactuarJoe&quot; Beckett said that Vincent was one of the &quot;less well-developed&quot; characters from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, he found his development in &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; to be satisfying. According to&#x27; &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;, &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; focused on developing Vincent due to his lack of backstory in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and regarded the mobile phone spin-off as &quot;Vincent fan service instead of &quot;FFVII&quot; canon&quot;. Steve Blum&#x27;s performance as Vincent achieved a positive response from fans and the media.

&quot;GamesRadar+&quot; claimed that they look forward to the character&#x27;s debut in the remake installments of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as the first volume still did not focus on him. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; was disappointed that Vincent&#x27;s role in &quot;Rebirth&quot; would not be as active as in the original game, comparing him to the early inclusion of Red XIII as AI controlled rather than playable.

<doc id="752682" wikidata="Q7141424" url="?curid=752682" title="Parzival (band)">
<text>Parzival is a band from Copenhagen, Denmark. Their musical style is somewhat reminiscent of that of Slovenian pioneers Laibach, but differs from it in that it has a less electronic sound, and incorporates elements of medieval music, Gregorian chants, and an overall epic feel. All of the band&#x27;s lyrics are in German and Latin (except &quot;Noblesse Oblige&quot; LP, lyrics of which are mainly in Russian by famous Russian poets of the 19th century, like Alexander Pushkin), to suit the group&#x27;s highly Wagnerian style.

The core of the band is Dimitrij Bablevskij, originally from Russia, but quite a few Danish guest musicians appear on their albums.

Though hard to define, the band&#x27;s music appeals mainly to the goth, metal, neo-folk and industrial scenes, and has achieved a modest cult following within their respective subcultures.

The band was earlier known as Stiff Miners, releasing two albums (&quot;Giselle&quot; and &quot;Vox Celesta&quot;) under that moniker. Their current name comes from Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s 13th-century German poem &quot;Parzival&quot;.

<doc id="752684" wikidata="Q500492" url="?curid=752684" title="Inspiral Carpets">
<text>Inspiral Carpets are an English rock band, part of the late-1980s/early-1990s Madchester movement. Formed in Oldham in 1983, the band&#x27;s most successful lineup featured frontman Tom Hingley, drummer Craig Gill, guitarist Graham Lambert, bassist Martyn Walsh and keyboardist Clint Boon. 

Going by &quot;The Furs&quot;, Lambert formed line-ups loosely with other various past band members from 1980 to 1983 until he and singer Stephen Holt met at The Moor End indie disco in Oldham in 1983. Holt sang on the first two independent singles. Holt departed the band before they signed with Mute Records, Inspiral Carpets are known for using organs and distorted guitars with influences from psychedelic rock. In 2011, Hingley departed the band, though members disagree about the circumstances. The band continued, reuniting with Holt. Inactive since Gill&#x27;s death in 2016, on 17 October 2022 the band announced they would be reforming and going on a tour of the UK in March and April 2023.

==History==
===Early years (1983–1995)===
Graham Lambert experimented with line ups from 1980 to 1983, going by &quot;The Furs&quot;, until he and Stephen Holt, a friend from their school days, formed Inspiral Carpets in 1983, originally as a garage rock- and punk-inspired band. Manchester drummer Chris Goodwin and bassist Tony Welsh helped record a demo and play live in and around the Oldham area. Due to Goodwin&#x27;s commitments the band recruited 14-year-old drummer Craig Gill in 1986. Tony Welsh also had other music commitments and departed in 1986. The band then had a succession of bass players (Rick Garage, Mark Hughes, Scott Carey) before Dave Swift, on bass and organist Clint Boon (at whose Ashton-under-Lyne studio the band had been rehearsing). The band released two albums of demos in the 1980s, &quot;Waiting for Ours&quot; and &quot;Songs of Shallow Intensity&quot;, including songs that would later be re-recorded.

Inspiral Carpets came to prominence along with bands such as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays in the Madchester scene of the late 1980s. The band first appeared on a flexi-disc with &quot;Garage Full of Flowers&quot; that was given free with Manchester&#x27;s &quot;Debris&quot; magazine in 1987. Their first proper release, the &quot;Cow&quot; cassette, soon followed. The 1988 &quot;Planecrash&quot; EP on the Playtime label received much airplay from Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who asked the band to record a session for his show. The band reworked their single &quot;Find Out Why&quot; as the theme song for the show &quot;8:15 from Manchester&quot;.

As the band&#x27;s popularity grew, Playtime&#x27;s distributor Red Rhino Records went bankrupt, leading Inspiral Carpets to form their own label, Cow Records, in March 1989. The label&#x27;s first release was the &quot;Trainsurfing&quot; EP. With half of the first album, &quot;Life&quot;, written, Holt and Swift departed and formed the Rainkings, so the band recruited Too Much Texas singer Tom Hingley and Martyn &quot;Bungle&quot; Walsh of The Next Step to replace them. Martyn Walsh became the band&#x27;s 13th bass player. After a handful of singles on their own label, with &quot;Move&quot; nearly reaching the UK top 40, the band signed a deal with Mute Records and soon experienced their first top-40 chart success in the UK with &quot;This Is How It Feels.&quot; The single reached No. 14 on the singles chart, and the debut album &quot;Life&quot; reached No. 2 on the albums chart in 1990.

The following year&#x27;s &quot;The Beast Inside&quot; was less well received by critics, but still achieved a top-5 album chart ranking. The &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Please be Cruel&quot; singles only reached No. 30 and No. 50 respectively, and an attempt to crack the American market largely failed. However, the band gained a strong following in Portugal, Germany and Argentina, where the 1992 album &quot;Revenge of the Goldfish&quot; became their most successful. The album peaked at number 17 in the UK and spawned four UK hit singles. The next album, &quot;Devil Hopping&quot; (1994), reached number 10 in the album chart, with &quot;Saturn 5&quot; and &quot;I Want You&quot; (featuring Mark E. Smith) as top-20 hits. The next single, &quot;Uniform&quot;, stalled at No. 51 and in 1995, after the release of a &quot;Singles&quot; collection, the band were dropped by Mute and split up soon after.

During this time, Noel Gallagher was a roadie for the band until he left to join Oasis.

===Post-split activities (1995–2003)===
Hingley formed a new band, the Lovers, along with Jerry Kelly of the Lotus Eaters (which later featured Steve and Paul Hanley of the Fall), while Boon formed the Clint Boon Experience, releasing a string of singles on the Artful label. Gill also formed a new band, Hustler, who eventually changed their name to Proud Mary after a song by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Proud Mary signed to Noel Gallagher&#x27;s Big Brother label some years later, while Walsh moved into production, largely working on techno and dance music. Two of the band&#x27;s roadies enjoyed musical success themselves: van driver Mark Collins joined the Charlatans in 1991 and drum technician Noel Gallagher joined Oasis.

In 1999, Strange Fruit Records released a compilation of tracks recorded for BBC Radio 1 sessions.

===Reformation (2003–2011)===
Inspiral Carpets reunited in 2003, playing to sellout crowds on tour and releasing the single &quot;Come Back Tomorrow&quot; (recorded in 1995) and a number of new compilation records, most notably the &quot;Cool As&quot; box set. The band have toured sporadically since, reuniting again in 2007 to tour in support of an iTunes-exclusive compilation of their B-sides and rarities. They played a tour in 2008 under the banner &quot;Return of the Cow&quot;, announcing that their own Cow Records label was to be revived.

===Hingley departs, Holt returns and Gill&#x27;s death (2011–2016)===
In February 2011, it was revealed that Tom Hingley was no longer part of the band, with the circumstances of his departure unclear. Band members indicated that Hingley had left of his own accord, with Clint Boon contradicting Hingley&#x27;s suggestion that the band had split up whilst Hingley later claimed that he had been fired by the band at a meeting.

In August 2011, the band announced a reunion with original singer Stephen Holt. Their website indicated that &quot;Inspirals will be recording their first material in 15 years coupled with concerts in South America &amp; Greece.&quot; The band recorded &quot;You&#x27;re So Good For Me&quot;/&quot;Head for the Sun&quot; for Record Store Day, a 7&quot; single that was released, sold and deleted on 21 April 2012. The accompanying video for the main track was shot at a concert in Buenos Aires in November 2011. In support of the single, the band toured the UK in March 2012 for the first time with Holt in 24 years. In May, the band were special guests on a Happy Mondays tour.

In the summer of 2012, the band played at several festivals, culminating with a live performance at the Old Trafford cricket ground on 10 September during England&#x27;s T20I match with South Africa. For Record Store Day in April 2014, Inspiral Carpets released &quot;Dung 4&quot;, a previously cassette-only collection of demos from 1987, on vinyl and CD, with the earlier tape &quot;Cow Demo&quot; added as a free 7&quot; with the vinyl version. &quot;Uncut&quot; said of the album: &quot;... the whole package is a fine summation of the Inspirals&#x27; enduring appeal&quot;.

In October 2014, the band released &quot;Inspiral Carpets&quot; on Cherry Red Records. Their first album in 20 years, &quot;Inspiral Carpets&quot; contained two past singles, &quot;You&#x27;re So Good for Me&quot; and &quot;Spitfire&quot;, plus 10 new tracks. The album also included &quot;Let You Down&quot;, co-written by and featuring punk poet John Cooper Clarke. Interviewed in &quot;Record Collector,&quot; Boon described the album as &quot;Diverse. A couple (of the songs) have an R.E.M. flavour, one nod to the 50s, two to Joy Division, several the Doors, one Northern soul, two the Beach Boys.&quot; After several dates in Europe over the summer, the band played 12 UK dates in December 2014 in support of the album&#x27;s release.

On 20 November 2016, drummer Craig Gill died at the age of 44. Memorial services were attended by music-industry friends including Inspiral Carpets members, Oasis singer Liam Gallagher, Stone Roses bassist Mani and Happy Mondays singer Rowetta. Soon after his death, Gill&#x27;s friends began a social-media campaign to make the band&#x27;s 1994 hit &quot;Saturn 5&quot; the Christmas number-one song for 2016.

===Reunion 2023===
In October 2022 the band announced they would be reforming and performing a live UK tour in March and April 2023. The band also announced that longtime bassist Martyn Walsh would not be joining them on their forthcoming tour. It was announced that Jake Fletcher will be touring with Inspiral Carpets in 2023 and that Kev Clark from Dub Sex will be on the drums for the tour.

On 15 February 2023, the group also announced their return to Australia for the first time in 30 years that August, as well as their first shows in New Zealand. On 17 March 2023, the band released a singles compilation, featuring all of their hit singles on cd/vinyl from 1988 to 2015 and remixes of the tracks. On 23 March 2023, just as the band&#x27;s tour starts, it was announced that Boon&#x27;s son, Oscar, would be joining the band for some of the tour on bass guitar.

On 28 October 2024 it was confirmed that Martyn Walsh would be rejoining the band on bass for the 2025 tour dates and in the studio.

<text>Kovačica (, ; ; ; ) is a town and municipality located in the South Banat District of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. According to the 2022 census, the town has a population of 5,398, while the municipality has 21,178 inhabitants. It is widely known for its naïve art that the local residents make without any form of art school.

==Geography==
The town of Kovačica is located 27km from Pančevo and 43km from Belgrade.

==History==
The town was founded in the 18th century, but there are records of small settlements dating from 1458. In the middle of the 18th century, this area was recorded as a wasteland. Settlement was founded in 1750 and was settled (in 1751–1752) by Serb soldiers from Potisje and Pomorišje, after military frontier in these regions was abolished.

First Slovaks came here from Ečka and Aradac (in 1783) and after them, Slovaks from Arvas, Trenčin and Bekeš county came here as well (in 1801). From the middle of the 19th century, Kovačica is a center of municipality and cultural and social center of Slovaks in Banat.

<text>Vassilis Tsitsanis ( 18 January 1915 – 18 January 1984) was a Greek songwriter and bouzouki player. He became one of the leading Greek composers of his time and is widely regarded as one of the founders of modern Rebetiko and Laiko music. Tsitsanis wrote more than 500 songs and is still remembered as an extraordinary composer and bouzouki player.

==Biography==
Tsitsanis was born in Trikala, in Thessaly, Greece. His family came from the region of Epirus. He has been described as having been an Aromanian, and his surname Tsitsanis could indicate some connection with the Aromanians of Metsovo. He was the only figure performing rebetiko at his time coming from the Greek mainland and not from the islands. This may be the reason why he was sometimes known as &quot;the Vlach&quot; by his fellow musicians, although this could be due to the actually Aromanian ethnic origin of Tsitsanis (as Aromanians are known as Vlachs in Greece). It is also rumored that Stratos Pagioumtzis gave him this nickname. Tsitsanis was also nicknamed &quot;Tsilias&quot;.

From a young age, Tsitsanis was interested in music and learned to play violin, mandola and mandolin which were mainstays of so many of his songs. In 1936, he left for Athens to study law, and by 1937 had also learned bouzouki and made his first musical recording. In 1938, he moved to Thessaloniki, where he completed his military service, and stayed there for about ten years, during the German occupation of Greece. There he became famous, opened also an ouzeri, got married and wrote many of his best songs that were later recorded after the end of the War. By the shut-down of the record companies by the German occupation Forces in 1941, he had already recorded about 100 of his own songs and played on many recordings of other composers.

In 1946, Tsitsanis returned to Athens and began recording many of his own compositions that made famous many of the singers that worked with him, such as Sotiria Bellou (&quot;Σωτηρία Μπέλου&quot;), Marika Ninou (&quot;Μαρίκα Νίνου&quot;), Ioanna Georgakopoulou and Prodromos Tsaousakis. Tsitsanis developed the &quot;westernization&quot; of the rebetiko and made it more known to large sections of the population, setting also the bases for the future &quot;laiko&quot;.

Vassilis Tsitsanis was a close friend with Andreas Papandreou, Prime Minister of the country. Tsitsanis died at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London following a lung operation, on his sixty-ninth birthday. He was mourned across Greece, where his music is still enjoyed to this day and he is regarded as a legend of rebetiko music.

<text>Trofa () is a city and a municipality in the north of the Porto metropolitan area in Portugal, from Porto. The population in 2021 was 38,548, in an area of . The city centre is formed by the parish Bougado (São Martinho e Santiago), which had 21,374 inhabitants in 2021. Another important locality in the municipality is Coronado.

Trofa has an industrial park, with various types of businesses including pharmaceutical, metalworking and textile industries. Bial, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Portugal is headquartered in Coronado.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Archaeological evidence suggests that the region now known as Trofa has been inhabited for thousands of years. Significant findings include 34 bronze axes discovered in São Martinho de Bougado, now housed in the Sociedade Martins Sarmento in Guimarães. Other notable prehistoric landmarks include rock carvings in the village of Maganha and the Castro of Alvarelhos, a fortified settlement classified as a National Monument in 1910. During the Roman era, the Castro gained prominence due to its location along a key road linking Porto (Cale) and Braga (Bracara Augusta). This road remained a foundational element in the region’s development over the centuries. The area was part of the lands of the madequisenses, an ethnic group whose territory spanned from the Atlantic Ocean to the Serra da Agrela mountain range and from the Leça to the Ave rivers.

The earliest known written reference to the area dates to 979, in a deed from the Monastery of Moreira in Maia. This document mentions Alvarelhos (alvarelios), São Cristóvão do Muro (sanctum christoforum), and Cedões (zadones), the latter located in Santiago de Bougado. By the 13th century, the region was part of the Terra da Maia, as documented in the inquiries of King Afonso III. This administrative structure persisted until 1384, when the territory was integrated into the jurisdiction of Porto.

In 1527, King Manuel I granted a foral (charter) to Maia, recognizing its administrative status and formalizing its privileges. Despite this recognition, the area remained largely rural, with its economy based on agriculture and small-scale crafts.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
The 19th century marked significant upheaval. During the Peninsular War in 1809, French forces under General Soult advanced through the region while marching toward Porto. Following the old Roman road, Soult’s central column attempted to cross the Ave River at Barca da Trofa but encountered strong local resistance. Unable to proceed, the troops were forced to bypass the area, encountering further defenses at the barricaded Ponte da Lagoncinha. These events are commemorated in sites such as Barca da Trofa, Souto de Bairros, and Lantemil.

The liberal reforms of 1835 brought administrative changes. Queen Maria II established the judicial district of Santo Tirso, which included the eight parishes that now form Trofa: São Martinho de Bougado, Santiago de Bougado, Covelas, Muro, Alvarelhos, Guidões, São Romão do Coronado, and São Mamede do Coronado.

The late 19th century brought significant industrial and infrastructural development to the region. The construction of the Porto-Braga railway, the Guimarães railway, and new road networks spurred industrialization and reshaped the Ave Valley&#x27;s economy. These changes marked the beginning of urbanization in Trofa, transitioning it from a predominantly rural area to an emerging industrial hub.

By the 20th century, Trofa had become a center for textile production, supported by the region’s industrial growth. However, this rapid development came at an environmental cost. The Ave River and its tributaries suffered severe pollution, leading to the decline of aquatic ecosystems and the loss of traditional industries such as flax processing, hydraulic mills, and agriculture along the riverbanks. Recreational use of the river also dwindled, with local communities turning away from the degraded waterways.

Efforts to establish Trofa as an independent municipality began after the Carnation Revolution in 1974. Trofa was granted town status in 1984 and elevated to city status in 1993. On November 19, 1998, the Portuguese Parliament approved the creation of the Municipality of Trofa, which officially gained administrative autonomy in 1999.

==Parishes==
Initially the municipality had eight parishes, but following the administrative changes in 2013, it was divided into five civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Alvarelhos e Guidões
* Bougado (São Martinho e Santiago)
* Coronado (São Romão e São Mamede)
* Covelas
* Muro

<text>Urs Meier (born 22 January 1959) is a retired Swiss football referee. He officiated at the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, taking charge of the semi-final between South Korea and Germany in 2002. He also refereed the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final that year. He appeared at Euro 2000 and Euro 2004, refereeing the quarter-final between England and Portugal in 2004. He retired 6 months later.

Meier received FIFA appointments and refereed in the Swiss top division until he reached the mandatory retirement age for each. He now appears as a pundit on the German television channel ZDF during World Cups and European Championships. He also owns a brand of household appliances in Würenlos, Switzerland.

==Life==
Meier was born on 22 January 1959 in Zürich.

==Career==
At the 1998 World Cup, Meier refereed the famous USA-Iran match. Later in an interview, he claimed that he had predicted himself as the referee of that match due to Switzerland&#x27;s role as protecting power of United States in Iran.

He refereed a qualification match for Euro 2004 between Romania and Denmark. Denmark equalised in extra time to eliminate Romania. Romanian side argued he should have ended the game more than a minute before. Also, the penalty allowing Denmark to score the first goal was highly disputed, even the Danish TV commentator saying &quot;only certain host teams are awarded such penalties&quot;. After several Romanian newspapers published his email address after the game, Meier received 14,000 e-mails, including death threats.

He refereed the Euro 2004 quarter-final between England and Portugal at Lisbon, which ended in a 2–2 draw with Portugal proceeding to win on a penalty shootout. In the 90th minute, Sol Campbell found the net, but Meier disallowed the goal citing a push on the Portuguese keeper. After the match Meier&#x27;s personal details were published by British tabloid newspapers and Meier received more than 16,000 abusive e-mails, including death threats. Reporters from &quot;The Sun&quot; travelled to Switzerland and placed a giant English flag on a field near his home. As a result, he was placed under police protection.

<text>was the forty-third of the sixty-nine stations of the Nakasendō connecting Edo with Kyoto in Edo period Japan. It is located in former Mino Province in what is now part of the city of Nakatsugawa, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. It was also the last of eleven stations along the Kisoji, which was the precursor to a part of the Nakasendō, running through the Kiso Valley. 

==History==

Magome-juku is located in a very mountainous section of the highway between Mino and Shinano Province. In places, the road was very steep and in the section between Magome-juku and the next station to the east, Tsumago-juku, travelers had to navigate an 800 meter mountain pass. The village is very old, and appears in Kamakura period records dated 1215 as part of the Tōyama &quot;Shōen&quot;, which had been awarded by Minamoto no Yoritomo to Kikuhime, the half-sister of Minamoto no Yoshinaka who lived in this location. In records dated 1487, it was referred to as &quot;Kiso Magome&quot; or &quot;Ena-gun Magome&quot;, although Magoma was in Mino, and not in the Kiso River valley. In the early Edo period, the system of post stations on the Nakasendō was formalized by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1602, and it became a stopping place for traveling merchants () and it was also on the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; route used by various western &quot;daimyō&quot; to-and-from the Shogun&#x27;s court in Edo. 

Per the 1843 guidebook issued by the , the town had a population of 717 people in 69 houses, including one &quot;honjin&quot;, one &quot;waki-honjin,&quot; and 18 &quot;hatago&quot;. The post station was 326.7 kilometers from Edo.

In the modern period, with the completion of the Chūō Main Line railway, it fell into obscurity and poverty; and many of its old buildings were destroyed by fires in 1895 and 1915. In recent decades, it has been restored to its appearance as an Edo period post town and is now a popular tourist destination. The central feature of Magome is its restored row of houses along the former post road, which runs at a slope between the town&#x27;s low and high ends. Most were built for common people in the mid-18th century, with shops and inns for travelers along the Nakasendō. A quiet portion of the original highway has been preserved between Magome-juku and Tsumago-juku, which was also restored. It provides for a pleasant walk through forests and past waterfalls. Bus service is also provided between the two post towns, allowing visitors to easily start at either end of the path.

==Notes of interest==
Magome was the birthplace and childhood home of noted author Shimazaki Tōson, who wrote about the Kiso region in his most famous novel, &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;, between 1929 and 1935. He is buried in the town&#x27;s small cemetery.

The town also offers a fine view of Mount Ena, which rises . Panoramic views of the surrounding mountains may be enjoyed from a vista above the main parking lot at Magome&#x27;s upper end.

==Gallery==
== Magome-juku in &quot;The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō&quot;==
Utagawa Hiroshige&#x27;s &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; print of Magome-juku dates from 1835 -1838. The print depicts the pass between Magome-juku and Tsumago-juku, with a narrow road wedged between the side of a mountain and a steep cliff. A man is followed by two &quot;Kago&quot; (palanquin) bearers, one of whom is carrying the empty &quot;kago&quot; by one pole on his shoulder while the other is retying his straw sandal. A man is approaching from the opposite direction, but we can see only the top of his straw hat, emphasizing the steep slope of the road. Further in the distance, an oxherd is riding his ox past a waterfall, and the roofs of the post station can be seen in the valley below. In the distance, Mount Ena looms as a grey shadow.

<doc id="752701" wikidata="Q1384643" url="?curid=752701" title="George Mackey">
<text>George Whitelaw Mackey (February 1, 1916 – March 15, 2006) was an American mathematician known for his contributions to quantum logic, representation theory, and noncommutative geometry.

==Career==
Mackey earned his B.A. at Rice University in 1938 and obtained his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1942 under the direction of Marshall H. Stone. He joined the Harvard University Mathematics Department in 1943, was appointed Landon T. Clay Professor of Mathematics and Theoretical Science in 1969 and remained there until he retired in 1985.

==Work==
Earlier in his career Mackey did significant work in the duality theory of locally convex spaces, which provided tools for subsequent work in this area, including Alexander Grothendieck&#x27;s work on topological tensor products.

Mackey was one of the pioneer workers in the intersection of quantum logic, the theory of infinite-dimensional unitary representations of groups, the theory of operator algebras and noncommutative geometry. A central role in Mackey&#x27;s work, both in the theory of group representations and in mathematical physics, was played by the concepts of system of imprimitivity and induced representations. This idea led naturally to an analysis of the representation theory of semi-direct products in terms of ergodic actions of groups and in some cases a complete classification of such representations. Mackey&#x27;s results were essential tools in the study of the representation theory of nilpotent Lie groups using the method of orbits developed by Alexandre Kirillov in the 1960s. His notion of &quot;virtual subgroup&quot;, introduced in 1966 using the language of groupoids, had a significant influence in ergodic theory.

Another essential ingredient in Mackey&#x27;s work was the assignment of a Borel structure to the dual object of a locally compact group (specifically a locally compact separable metric group) &quot;G&quot;. One of Mackey&#x27;s important conjectures, which was eventually solved by work of James Glimm on C*-algebras, was that &quot;G&quot; is type I (meaning that all its factor representations are of type I) if and only if the Borel structure of its dual is a standard Borel space.

He has written numerous survey articles connecting his research interests with a large body of mathematics and physics, particularly quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.

==Honours and students==
Mackey was among the first five recipients of William Lowell Putnam fellowships in 1938. He received the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1975 for his article &quot;Ergodic theory and its significance for statistical mechanics and probability theory&quot;.

Mackey was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

Lawrence G. Brown, Paul Chernoff, Edward G. Effros, Calvin Moore, Richard Palais, Caroline Series, John Wermer and Robert Zimmer have been doctoral students of Mackey. Andrew Gleason had no PhD, but considered Mackey to be his advisor.
