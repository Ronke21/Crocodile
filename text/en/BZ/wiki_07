<text>Grand Forks International Airport is a public airport five miles (8 km) northwest of Grand Forks, in Grand Forks County, North Dakota, United States. GFK has no scheduled passenger flights out of the country but has an &quot;international&quot; title (like many other airports) because it has customs service for arrivals from Canada and other countries.

The airport, sometimes called Mark Andrews International Airport after Mark Andrews, a former U.S. House Representative and U.S. Senator from North Dakota, is owned by the Grand Forks Regional Airport Authority and located on U.S. Highway 2, around four miles (6 km) west of Interstate 29, within city limits in a detached section of the city that is surrounded by Rye Township.

In 2009 the airport&#x27;s FAA control tower was the 23rd-busiest in the nation, with 346,165 tower operations. About 90% of all operations at GFK are flights operated by the University of North Dakota&#x27;s John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences, which is based on the field.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

==Governance==
GFK is a non-hub, primary commercial service airport.

The Grand Forks Regional Airport Authority is a public, non-profit organization established as a joint partnership between Grand Forks County and the City of Grand Forks. This is the governance of the airport. The Airport Authority consists of a seven-member Board of Commissioners appointed by the Grand Forks Mayor, Brandon Bochenski, and the Grand Forks County Commission. Dane Simonson is the Chair of the Board followed by Cynthia Pic, Vice Chair. Other members of the board include Karl Bollingberg, Tim Mutchler, Rick Meland, Steve Kuhlman, and Kyle Kvamme. The Airport Authority staff consists of Ryan Riesinger, Executive Director, Krista Martin, Director of Finance/Administration, Katie Olson, Administrative Assistant, and Joey Castiglione, Director of Operations and Maintenance (Grand Forks International Airport, 2023).

==Infrastructure==

===Terminal===
The now closed original passenger terminal at GFK was built in 1964. Outside terminal security were the Delta and Allegiant Airlines ticketing counters, a restaurant, a gift shop and a waiting area. After passing through security screening there is a small waiting area that served the terminal&#x27;s two passenger gates.

In the mid-2000s, discussion began of upgrading or totally replacing the terminal as it has structural and safety problems and leaves little to no room for expansion. Findings from a study commissioned by the Grand Forks Regional Airport Authority were released in early 2005. The study, which was done by Ulteig Engineers, gave the Airport Authority options for the future of the passenger terminal. The list of problems included mold growth, roof leakage, differential settlement, blocking runway line of sight, passenger boarding, potential equipment damage from basement flooding, outdated electrical and mechanical systems, no sprinkler system, code deficiencies, insufficient parking setback, and interior traffic circulation issues.

The consulting group recommended that a brand new passenger terminal would the best solution to the current terminal&#x27;s problems. Five locations for a new terminal were evaluated favoring a site between the cargo apron and general aviation apron. Ground was broken on the new terminal in July 2009, with completion expected by 2011. The building was named the Byron L Dorgan Terminal, in honor of retired North Dakota Senator Byron Dorgan. It was opened and dedicated on August 30, 2011.

The new passenger terminal, designed by JLG Architects, is a two-story building, with Delta and Allegiant ticketing counters, baggage claim carousel, and several rental car agencies. The first floor has an inline checked baggage screening system. The Grand Forks Regional Airport Authority has several offices on the second floor, along with the TSA security checkpoint. Beyond security is a waiting area for both of the airport&#x27;s gates. Red River Valley Grill also serves both the public and secured side of the airport for concessions and beverages. There is also a small gift shop in the grill.

===UND Aerospace===
GFK&#x27;s largest tenant is not an airline, but the University of North Dakota&#x27;s John D. Odegard Aerospace Program. The university utilizes 11 heated hangars to house approximately 120 aircraft. A flight operations building that is the headquarters for dispatching aircraft, pre-briefing students for flights, and an on-site cafeteria on the top level of the five-story building. GFK also houses UND&#x27;s Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) training facility. The facility is used for ground briefings, flight simulators, and systems training for students who are pursuing a major focusing on unmanned aircraft. The most recent addition at GFK was a new hangar for UND&#x27;s helicopter flight training operations completed December 2011.

Most operations (takeoff and landing) at GFK is from the University of North Dakota. The UND Aerospace Foundation occupies the northeastern (Bravo), and eastern (Charlie) ramps on the airport. UND operates a fleet over 120 aircraft including a Cessna 172, Cessna 150s, Piper Seminoles, Piper Archers, and several Beechcraft King Air 90s and a pair of American Champion Decathlons for flight training. Several buildings complement such a fleet of aircraft, including a dispatch center, a full-time maintenance center, and dedicated line support personal.

===Runways===
Grand Forks International Airport covers and has four runways:

* Runway 9L/27R: concrete
* Runway 17L/35R: concrete
* Runway 17R/35L: asphalt
* Runway 9R/27L: concrete

Due to the increased amount of general aviation traffic, primarily from the UND Aerospace flight training school, a fourth runway has been completed on the southeast side of the airport. It is a parallel east–west runway named 9R/27L. The previous runway 8/26 was renamed in October 2008 to 9L/27R in preparation for the new runway. Plans in 2022 to extend 9L/27R.

===Based aircraft and operations===
In the year ending December 31, 2022 the airport had 301,694 aircraft operations, average 826 per day: 62% general aviation, 38% air taxi, &lt;1% commercial, and &lt;1% military. At that time, there were 143 aircraft based at this field: 117 single-engine, 20 multi-engine, 1 jet, and 5 helicopter.

===FBO===
Avflight Grand Forks, the fixed-base operator at the airport, completed construction of a new $4.5 million facility in autumn 2008. This facility increased Avflight&#x27;s heated hangar and aircraft support space to , making it the largest aircraft service center in North Dakota. The previous facilities are now used by wing of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, housing a number of government aircraft and helicopters. Valley Med Fight, an air ambulance company, also occupies near by hangars, which are managed by Avflight. The FBO also handles all ground operations for Allegiant.

Originally GFK Flight Support, the FBO and its facilities were purchased by the Saginaw, Michigan-based Avflight Corporation and re-branded as Avflight Grand Forks in 2015.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===


Allegiant Air uses Airbus A320-214s and Airbus A319-111s to Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Orlando. Delta Connection uses Bombardier CRJ900s and Embraer E175s operated by SkyWest Airlines to Minneapolis. 
===Cargo===
FedEx Express was the second-largest employer at KGFK. The FedEx ramp at KGFK served the entire state of North Dakota, northwestern Minnesota, and small portions of South Dakota and Montana. FedEx had over 100 employees—customer service representatives, ramp agents, couriers, semi-drivers and jet aircraft and vehicle maintenance workers. Ramp agents worked evening or early morning shifts, loading and unloading the aircraft, feeder planes and trucks. FedEx contracted with Corporate Air to provide pilots and maintenance for eleven feeder aircraft. Corporate Air was KGFK&#x27;s tenth-largest employer.

On February 17, 2016, FedEx announced that it would be moving its operations from the Grand Forks Airport to Fargo&#x27;s Hector International Airport. FedEx moved all flight operations to Fargo on October 31, 2016.

==Statistics==
===Annual traffic===


On November 9, 2010, GFK had 100,570 boardings, one more than the record achieved in 12 months in 1994. As of April 2014, passenger boardings at GFK had reached 147,000, a 7% increase year-over-year (April 2012 – April 2013).

During the same period, Delta led passenger traffic with 181,550 passengers (arriving and departing) and maintained a 59.64% market share. Allegiant trailed at 117,000 total passengers and a 39.98% market share. Scheduled departures have risen to 5,572, compared to 4,355 in 2010.

On October 3, 2012, United Airlines (operated by United Express) started flying between Denver and Grand Forks. Less than one year later, on September 10, 2013, United announced they would terminate service on December 3, 2013, citing low load factors.

==Ground Transportation==
As of 2023, there is no public transit service to Grand Forks International Airport. The closest Cities Area Transit bus stop is located over 3 miles away.

<doc id="726880" wikidata="Q1473258" url="?curid=726880" title="Pax Mongolica">
<text>The Pax Mongolica (Latin for &quot;Mongol Peace&quot;), less often known as Pax Tatarica (&quot;Tatar Peace&quot;), is a historiographical term modeled after the original phrase &quot;Pax Romana&quot; which describes the stabilizing effects of the conquests of the Mongol Empire on the social, cultural and economic life of the inhabitants of the vast Eurasian territory that the Mongols conquered in the 13th and 14th centuries. The term is used to describe the eased communication and commerce that the unified administration helped to create and the period of relative peace that followed the Mongols&#x27; vast and violent conquests.

The conquests of Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227) and his successors, spanning from Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe, effectively took over the Eastern world with the Western world. The Silk Road, connecting trade centres across Asia and Europe, came under the sole rule of the Mongol Empire. It was commonly said that &quot;a maiden bearing a nugget of gold on her head could wander safely throughout the realm&quot;. Despite the political fragmentation of the Mongol Empire into four khanates (Yuan dynasty, Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate), nearly a century of conquest and civil war was followed by relative stability in the early 14th century. The end of the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot; was marked by the disintegration of the khanates and the outbreak of the Black Death in Asia which spread along trade routes to much of the world in the mid-14th century.

During this time, Mongol elements including the ʼPhags-pa script made numerous appearances in Western art.

==Mongol expansion==

&quot;Pax Mongolica&quot; followed the wake of conquests by the Mongol Empire beginning with Genghis Khan in the early 13th century. In the process of conquering the various tribes in the region, Genghis Khan revolutionised the way Mongolian tribal society was structured. After each new victory, more and more people were incorporated under Genghis Khan&#x27;s rule, thus diversifying the societal balance of the tribe. In 1203, Genghis Khan, in an effort to strengthen his army, ordered a reform that reorganised his army&#x27;s structure while breaking down the traditional clan- and kindred-based divisions that had previously fragmented the society and military. He arranged his army into &quot;arbans&quot; (inter-ethnic groups of ten), and the members of an &quot;arban&quot; were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin. Ten &quot;arbans&quot; made a &quot;zuun&quot;, or a company; ten &quot;zuuns&quot; made a &quot;myangan&quot;, or a battalion; and ten &quot;myangans&quot; formed a &quot;tumen&quot;, or an army of 10,000. This decimal system organisation of Genghis Khan&#x27;s strong military would prove very effective in conquering, by persuasion or force, the many tribes of the central Asian steppe, but it would also strengthen Mongol society as a whole. By 1206 Genghis Khan&#x27;s military expansion had unified the tribes of Mongolia, and in the same year he was elected and acclaimed as the leader of Mongolia.

The new Mongol empire quickly moved to annex more territory. The first Mongol conquests were campaigns against the Western Xia. In 1209 the Mongols conquered the Western Xia. Between 1213 and 1214 the Mongols conquered the Jin Empire, and by 1214 the Mongols had captured most of the land north of the Yellow River. In 1221 Mongol generals Jebe and Subodei began their expedition around the Caspian Sea and into Kievan Rus&#x27;; Genghis Khan defeated Turkic Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu at the Battle of Indus; the Khwarezmian Empire were defeated that same year. In 1235 the Mongols successfully invaded Korea. Two years later in 1237 Batu Khan and Subodei began their conquest of Rus&#x27;; they invaded Poland and Hungary in 1241. In 1252 the Mongols began their invasion of Song China; they would seize the capital of Hangzhou in 1276. In 1258 Hulagu Khan captured Baghdad.

Each new victory gave the Mongols the chance to incorporate new people, especially foreign engineers and labourers, into their society. Each new conquest also acquired new trade routes and the opportunity to control taxation and tribute. Thus, through territorial expansion, the Mongol Nation not only became an empire, but also became more technologically and economically advanced.

==Trade network==
At its height, the Mongolian empire stretched from Busan in the east to Budapest in the west, from Lithuania in the north to Vietnam in the south. This meant that an extremely large part of the continent was united under one political authority. As a result, the trade routes used by merchants became safe for travel, resulting in an overall growth and expansion of trade from China in the east to Britain in the west. Thus, the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot; greatly influenced many civilizations in Eurasia during the 13th and 14th centuries.

Under the Mongols new technologies and commodities were exchanged across the Old World, particularly Eurasia. Thomas T. Allsen noted many personnel exchanges occurred during the Mongol period. There were many significant developments in economy (especially trade and public finance), military, medicine, agriculture, cuisine, astronomy, printing, geography, and historiography, which were not limited to Eurasia but also included North Africa.

===World trade system: the Silk Road===

Before the Mongols&#x27; rise, the Old World system consisted of isolated imperial systems. The new Mongol empire amalgamated the once isolated civilizations into a new continental system, and re-established the Silk Road as a dominant method of transportation. The unification of Eurasia under the Mongols greatly diminished the number of competing tribute gatherers throughout the trade network and assured greater safety and security in travel. During the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;, European merchants like Marco Polo made their way from Europe to China on the well-maintained and well travelled roads that linked Anatolia to China.

On the Silk Road caravans with Chinese silk; pepper, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg came to the West from the Spice Islands via the transcontinental trade routes. Eastern diets were introduced to Europeans as well. Indian muslins, cottons, pearls, and precious stones were sold in Europe, as well as weapons, carpets, and leather goods from Iran. Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China. In the opposite direction, Europeans sent silver, fine cloth, horses, linen, and other goods to the near and far East. Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets, thus increasing the GDP of each nation or society that was involved in the trade system. Μany of the cities participating in the 13th century world trade system grew rapidly in size.

Along with land trade routes, a Maritime Silk Road contributed to the flow of goods and establishment of a &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;. This Maritime Silk Road started with short coastal routes in Southern China. As technology and navigation progressed these routes developed into a high-seas route into the Indian Ocean. Eventually these routes further developed encompassing the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and the sea off East Africa.

Along with tangible goods, people, techniques, information, and ideas moved lucidly across the Eurasian landmass for the first time. For example, John of Montecorvino, archbishop of Beijing founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language. Long-distance trade brought new methods of doing business from the far East to Europe; bills of exchange, deposit banking, and insurance were introduced to Europe during the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;. Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveller would not be burdened by the weight of metal coins.

Islamic methods of mathematics, astronomy, and science made their way to Africa, East Asia and Europe during the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;. Methods of paper-making and printing made their way from China to Europe. Rudimentary banking systems were established, and money changing and credit extension were common, resulting in large amounts of merchant wealth.

===Mongol administration===
Mongolia&#x27;s central geographical position on the Asian continent was an important reason why it was able to play such a large role in the trade system. The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire. The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travelers on these routes. Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire. A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised. To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing, the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travelers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.

The Mongols sought alliances with other nations and societies to ensure the flow of trade through the empire. The Mongol army was also used to reshape and streamline the flow of trade through the continent by destroying cities on the less-important or more inaccessible routes. The Mongol military was mostly made up of cavalrymen. This allowed the military to move swiftly and easily over large distances.

The Mongols developed the concepts of liability in relation to investments and loans in Mongol–ortoq partnerships, promoting trade and investment to facilitate the commercial integration of the Mongol Empire. In Mongol times, the contractual features of a Mongol-&quot;ortoq&quot; partnership closely resembled that of qirad and commenda arrangements, however, Mongol investors used metal coins, paper money, gold and silver ingots and tradable goods for partnership investments and primarily financed money-lending and trade activities. Moreover, Mongol elites formed trade partnerships with merchants from Central and Western Asia and Europe, including Chinese and Marco Polo&#x27;s family.

The code of Mongol law, known as the &quot;Yassa&quot; (&quot;Great Law&quot;), decreed strict rules and punishments in many areas of the Mongolian Empire&#x27;s society, especially those areas concerning trade and commerce. The &quot;Yassa&quot; helped suppress the traditional causes of tribal feuding and war, thus helping to ensure a peaceful trading and traveling environment. Theft and animal rustling were outlawed, and the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan even established a massive lost-and-found system. Harsh penalties including a retribution of nine times the original value of stolen goods helped deter theft on Mongol roads. The &quot;Yassa&quot; also decreed complete religious freedom, ensuring that Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, etc., were all allowed to travel freely throughout the empire; religious leaders were also exempted from taxation, as were doctors, lawyers, undertakers, teachers, and scholars. The &quot;Yassa&quot; did allow for flexibility and it usually adapted, absorbed, or built upon legal systems in remote parts of the empire, thus maintaining a level of openness to various societies and ensuring peace and stability.

In order to ensure Mongol law was enforced, a hierarchy of legal administration was developed. This was headed by the Secretarial Council &quot;chung-shu-sheng&quot; (中書省) of the central government which oversaw 10 provincial governments known as &quot;hsing-sheng&quot; (行省). The Xingsheng was further split into smaller districts which handled legal cases. A police commissioner known as &quot;hsien wei&quot; (縣委) was entrusted with law enforcement and had the authority to arrest suspects. This method of federalising the empire made it easier and more efficient for laws to be administered throughout the continent.

=== Postal system ===
The Mongols established the Yam (, &quot;Örtöö&quot;, &quot;checkpoint&quot;), the first system of communication that connected the Far East and the West. Relay stations were set up every 25–30 miles or an average day&#x27;s journey on horse. These stations were introduced by Ögedei Khan in 1234 and supplied fresh horses and fodder. His brothers Chagatai Khan and Tolui and his nephew Batu Khan further extended this network.

The Mongol army administered the Yam. The Yam stretched across Mongol territory from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean. The routes were well organised, funded, maintained, and administered by the Mongols. This highly sophisticated system of communication and travel made it relatively easy to send important messages and travel long distances in relatively short amounts of time. As a result of the relatively lucid communication and ease of movement, the Mongols were able to govern their vast empire effectively, thereby ensuring political and economic stability.

==Decline==
The decline of &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot; was a result of a number of factors: incompetent and rivaling leaders, corruption, revolts, decadence, factional struggles, assassinations, external attacks, and disease. The decline of the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot; resulted in a decline of eased trade between East and West.

===Decline of Mongol rule===
The Mongol Empire, near the time of its decline, consisted of many different territories. Each territory was defined as a &quot;khanate&quot;. Due to the isolation of the Mongolian world, many rulers in the 14th century started to focus on their own khanates.

Religious intolerance was one particular factor in the decline of the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;. In Rus&#x27;, the Mongols (known as the Golden Horde), gradually lost power and territory due to intolerance specifically geared towards different religions. The Rus&#x27; Mongols converted to Islam and joined the Egyptian Mamluks for political reasons. At one point in the war, the Golden Horde even fought the Persian Mongols. The eastern part of the Golden Horde, White Horde, had friendly relations with the Ilkhanate and the Great Khan. The decentralisation occurred because communication was so difficult due to the collapsing trade system and the rivalry between Mongol princes. Eventually, the Persian Mongol leader Ghazan converted to Islam in 1295. This contributed to the growing power of Nawruz; a Muslim Oirat general.

In China, descendants of Kublai Khan claimed the Mongols weakened their power by becoming &quot;too Chinese&quot;. This led to Yuan emperors separating themselves from their subjects in order to stress their Mongol identity and to reject their Chinese culture. Kublai Khan once promoted Chinese culture and the importance of its practice but under the Yuan emperors this was prohibited. As the Chinese culture was changing, intolerance became more common. Some Chinese thought that the Mongols were planning to kill Chinese children and perform sexual rituals on them. As a result many Chinese became xenophobic towards the Mongols. This xenophobia led Chinese rulers to expel the Mongols from China and form the Ming dynasty.

===Bubonic plague===

The segregation and fragmentation of the respective khanates in the Mongol Empire were not the only factors in contributing to the decline of the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;. The outbreak of bubonic plague, or Black Death, also played a devastating role in the decline of the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;. Because the Mongol Empire bridged once isolated regions, it made it easy for the Black Death to spread rapidly. Historian William H. McNeill has noted that the plague was transferred from ground rodents living in southern Chinese and Burmese Himalayan foothills to Mongol soldiers when they invaded the area in 1252. In 1331 the plague was noted in China, and from East Asia it was carried west along the trade routes by merchants and Mongol soldiers who were able to so freely and quickly travel across the continent during the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;. Plague-infected fleas hitched rides in the manes of horses, on the hair of camels, or on black rats that nestled in cargoes or in saddlebags. The Black Death is estimated to have killed one-third of China&#x27;s population and 25-50% of Europe&#x27;s population.

Demographically weakened, the Mongols were not able to exert their rule over remote domains in their empire, which began to revolt once the plague broke out. These revolts disrupted the production of goods and flow of trade, which ended the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot;.

===Effects on trade===
Over the next 300 years, China became increasingly isolationist and inward-looking. China prohibited foreigners, foreign trade, and languages other than Chinese. Confucianism and Taoism were reinstated as the national religions, and the Chinese experienced cultural stagnation. During the early years of the Ming dynasty, despite the voyages of Zheng He, trade with the rest of the world overall declined. This is attributed to wars, epidemics and widespread disruptions rather than &quot;symbolic policy change&quot;. Economic difficulties also contributed to the decline as an important world trade player. The Black Death quickly spread to the rest of the world trade system, and the long-distance trading that was common and applauded during the &quot;Pax Mongolica&quot; almost entirely stopped.

<doc id="726884" wikidata="Q1049789" url="?curid=726884" title="Nightlife (Pet Shop Boys album)">
<text>Nightlife is the seventh studio album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 8 October 1999 by Parlophone. After the release and promotion of their previous album, &quot;Bilingual&quot; (1996), Pet Shop Boys started work with playwright Jonathan Harvey on the stage musical that eventually became &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; (at one stage during the writing process, the musical was given the name of &quot;Nightlife&quot;). Pet Shop Boys soon had an album&#x27;s worth of tracks and decided to release the album &quot;Nightlife&quot; as a concept album and in order to showcase some of the songs that would eventually make it into the musical.

The album incorporates a variety of musical influences, including hard trance on the Rollo-produced &quot;For Your Own Good&quot; and &quot;Radiophonic&quot;; dance-pop on &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What You Want but I Can&#x27;t Give It Any More&quot;; disco pastiche on &quot;New York City Boy&quot;; and country music on &quot;You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You&#x27;re Drunk&quot;. The track &quot;Happiness Is an Option&quot; is based on Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s classical piece Vocalise, Op. 34, No. 14.

As of May 2001, the album had sold 1.2 million copies worldwide. It reached number seven on the UK Albums Chart (their first studio album not to reach the top five) and spent three weeks on the chart at the time, but re-entered at number 29 in 2017 following the album&#x27;s &quot;Further Listening 1996–2000&quot; reissue. It also became the duo&#x27;s lowest-charting studio album in the United States, reaching number 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==&quot;In Denial&quot; with Kylie Minogue==
&quot;In Denial&quot; is a duet featuring Kylie Minogue. It was seen as a risk by critics because this project came at a time when Minogue was experiencing low record sales and did not have her own record contract. Pet Shop Boys had previously written a song titled &quot;Falling&quot; for Minogue&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;. The same year as &quot;Nightlife&quot; release, Minogue also signed to Parlophone and released her hugely successful &quot;Light Years&quot; album in 2000. Minogue would later sing &quot;In Denial&quot; on her , with Neil Tennant&#x27;s pre-recorded vocals being played as part of the duet while Minogue sang live.

==Visuals==
For the promotion of the album, the band adopted a stark new appearance, designed in consultation with theatre designer Ian McNeil. Now, the duo ubiquitously appeared wearing thick, dark eyebrows, inspired by Kabuki theatre; yellow or orange wigs in a variety of hairstyles, inspired by the punk subculture (especially several spiked wigs); and black sunglasses. This was supported by a series of outfits in dark, muted colours, the most deviant of which incorporated culottes, inspired by the attire of samurai, instead of trousers. Photographs involving the costumes were often set in urban environments; the Midland Grand Hotel in Kings Cross, London was used as the setting to debut the look. The costumes were used for promotional photographs, the album cover and liner notes, all the single covers, as well as the Nightlife Tour.

The music video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What You Want But I Can&#x27;t Give It Anymore&quot; showed Tennant and Lowe being transformed into their new appearances, though in a fantastical manner: they are operated on by medical laboratory machines, then covered in talcum powder and dressed by monks in a ritual-like manner. Finally, they are given dogs on leashes and released into a &quot;different world&quot;, where everyone else is also dressed in exactly the same way. Conceptualised among the band members, McNeil, and director Pedro Romhanyi, the video was created to showcase the costumes. It was visually influenced by the films &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971) in the initial transformation sequence (copying many of its shots and props precisely); &quot;Ridicule&quot; (1996), in the ritualistic dressing-up scene; &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), in the decor of the living room with an illuminated floor; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), in the outdoor urban setting.

According to Tennant, the costumes helped him to distance himself from the songs, adding to the impersonal nature of &quot;Nightlife&quot;. In other interviews, he explained that they played into his belief in the need for pop stars to have &quot;bigger than life&quot; public images, and were a reaction against the &quot;naturalistic&quot; look of the 1990s.

Effort was also spent on designing the tour&#x27;s visuals, with sets designed by deconstructivist architect Zaha Hadid. The stage was modular, and could fit in differently-sized venues and be rearranged by the backing singers throughout each concert.

<doc id="726885" wikidata="Q1128255" url="?curid=726885" title="By-product">
<text>A by-product or byproduct is a secondary product derived from a production process, manufacturing process or chemical reaction; it is not the primary product or service being produced.

A by-product can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste: for example, bran, which is a byproduct of the milling of wheat into refined flour, is sometimes composted or burned for disposal, but in other cases, it can be used as a nutritious ingredient in human food or animal feed. Gasoline was once a byproduct of oil refining that later became a desirable commodity as motor fuel. The plastic used in plastic shopping bags also started as a by-product of oil refining. By-products are sometimes called co-products to indicate that although they are secondary, they are desired products. For example, hides and leather may be called co-products of beef production. There is no strict distinction between by-products and co-products.

== In economics ==
In the context of production, a by-product is the &quot;output from a joint production process that is minor in quantity and/or net realizable value (NRV) when compared with the main products&quot;. Because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of joint costs. By-products also, by convention, are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is typically recognized as &quot;other income&quot;, or as a reduction of joint production processing costs when the by-product is produced.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) defines &quot;by-product&quot; in the context of life-cycle assessment by defining four different product types: &quot;main products, co-products (which involve similar revenues to the main product), by-products (which result in smaller revenues), and waste products (which provide little or no revenue).&quot;

== In chemistry ==
While some chemists treat &quot;by-product&quot; and &quot;side-product&quot; as synonyms in the above sense of a generic secondary (untargeted) product, others find it useful to distinguish between the two. When the two terms are distinguished, &quot;by-product&quot; is used to refer to a product that is not desired but inevitably results from molecular fragments of starting materials and/or reagents that are not incorporated into the &quot;desired product&quot;, as a consequence of conservation of mass; in contrast, &quot;side-product&quot; is used to refer to a product that is formed from a competitive process that could, in principle, be suppressed by an optimization of reaction conditions.

==Common byproducts==
*bagasse and molasses from sugar production
*bran and germ from flour milling
*buttermilk from butter production
*distillers grains from ethanol production
*fly ash and bottom ash from coal combustion
*glycerol from soap or biodiesel production
*lanolin from wool processing
*lees from wine fermentation
*pomace from fruit juice or olive oil production
*saw dust from lumber production
*slag from smelting ore
*straw from grain harvesting
*trub from beer fermentation
*vinasse from sugar or ethanol production
*whey from cheese production

== See also ==
* Main product
* By-product synergy
* Circular economy
* Side reaction

<text>Alan Edden Huckle (born 15 June 1948) is an English senior diplomat in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the British Government. He was the commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) and the British Antarctic Territory from 23 April 2001 until 12 January 2004, when he left to become the governor of Anguilla in the Caribbean. He was the Governor of Anguilla from 29 July 2004 to July 2006, having been appointed in July 2003.

In July 2005, it was announced that Huckle would soon be leaving Anguilla to become Governor of the British Overseas Territory of the Falkland Islands and the Commissioner for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, all of which are located in the South Atlantic Ocean. He was succeeded in Anguilla by Andrew George, on 10 July 2006.

During his time as Governor of the Falkland Islands, Huckle oversaw the implementation of the new Constitution in 2009. He was succeeded as Governor by Nigel Haywood in October 2010.

<text>USS &quot;Jarrett&quot; (FFG-33), was the twenty-fifth ship of the guided missile frigates, was named for Vice Admiral Harry B. Jarrett (1898–1974).

Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California on 23 January 1978 as part of the FY78 program, &quot;Jarrett&quot; was laid down on 11 February 1981, launched on 17 October 1981, commissioned on 2 July 1983, and decommissioned on 21 April 2011.

&quot;Jarrett&quot; was the first US Navy warship to be commanded by a woman, Commander Kathleen A. McGrath, from 18 December 1998 until 4 September 2000.

==Service history==

===12 May—12 November 1987===
During a deployment to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf &quot;Jarrett&quot; took part in Operation Earnest Will, an operation to maintain freedom of navigation within the Persian Gulf, that included renaming and reflagging 11 Kuwaiti tankers.

In the &quot;Tanker War&quot; between the Iranians and Iraqis, the Iranians utilized 1,662 ton former South Korean roll-on, roll-off vessel to lay mines to cut the sea lanes to Iraq. &quot;Iran Ajr&quot; stopped overnight on 21 September 1987, at a two-towered rig named &quot;Rashadat&quot; in the Rastam gas-oil separation platform (GOSP) complex, 120 miles east of Bahrain. The rig had been shut down for almost two years following Iraqi discovery that the Iranians used &quot;Rashadat&quot; for radar tracking of ships and for launching small boats. &quot;Iran Ajr&quot; turned toward the tanker routes, but just before midnight three Army helicopters, consisting of a Boeing MH-6 &quot;Little Bird&quot; and a pair of AH-6 &quot;Sea Bats&quot; of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), at least one of the helos flew from &quot;Jarrett&quot;, surprised the minelayer 50 miles northeast of Bahrain.

President Ronald W. Reagan later announced that &quot;Iran Ajr&quot; posed &quot;a direct threat to the safety of U.S. warships and other U.S.-flag vessels.&quot; The Iranian ship began to lay mines in an area where Middle East Force (MEF) flagship sailed, and when reporters afterwards queried Rear Admiral Harold J. Bernsen, Commander MEF, about the Iranians&#x27; intent to sink the flagship he replied, &quot;Absolutely.&quot; At 2302 therefore, the Army helos announced &quot;inbound hot&quot; and attacked the Iranian ship into the mid-watch, damaging her with 2.75 in (70 mm) rockets and 7.62 mm (0.30 in) M134 Minigun fire, and killing at least four crewmen.

&quot;La Salle&quot;, amphibious assault ship , guided-missile cruisers and , guided-missile destroyer , and guided-missile frigates and &quot;Jarrett&quot; made for the area. Men of Sea, Air, Land (SEAL) Team 2 backed-up by two Marine helos, boarded and captured the ship from a landing craft during the morning watch. The boarders gathered 24 survivors on board or from the water (one later died), impounded the minelayer, photographed evidence, and located at least nine remaining mines. The prisoners were later returned to Iran.

===7 December 1990 – 6 June 1991===

During a deployment to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf, &quot;Jarrett&quot;, with two Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawks of Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (Light) (HSL)-45 Detachment 2 embarked took part in the Persian Gulf War I. During the coalition air attacks in Operation Desert Storm, many Iraqi jets fled to Iran. Following &quot;Jarrett&quot;s arrival in the Persian Gulf on 25 January 1991, she consequently operated as an antiair picket off the Iranian coast (3–11 February).

The ship then embarked two Army Bell OH-58D &quot;Kiowas&quot; and 13 soldiers of B Troop, 4th Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment (Air) (Reconnaissance), 18th Aviation Brigade (Corps) (Airborne). On 16 February 1991, the &quot;Kiowas&quot; flew a night coastal reconnaissance flight, and &quot;Jarrett&quot; re-directed them approximately 40 miles north to assess bomb damage on an Iraqi HY-2G &quot;Silkworm&quot; (CSS-C-2 Sea Eagle-2) surface-to-surface missile site. Navy Grumman A-6E &quot;Intruders&quot; bombed the site, but the helos discovered that the &quot;Intruders&quot; failed to destroy the Silkworms, and carrier jets bombed them again.

The two helicopters refueled on board &quot;Jarrett&quot; and lifted off, equipped with AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles. Battleship operated an AAI RQ-2 Pioneer remotely piloted vehicle (RPV) subsequently designated an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that helped the battleship direct her naval gunfire support of the troops fighting ashore. Crewmen launched the Pioneer with the assistance of a rocket-powered booster and recovered the aircraft by utilizing a net strung between two cables on the fantail. The vehicle transmitted images to shipboard TV monitors that enabled men to &quot;walk&quot; rounds onto their targets. The Pioneer revealed that at least one Iraqi missile survived the second bombing, and one of the &quot;Kiowas&quot; launched a Hellfire that destroyed the Silkworm.

&quot;Jarrett&quot; passed through areas swept clear of mines off the Kuwaiti coast and joined British destroyer and frigate while they protected &quot;Missouri&quot; as the battleship shelled enemy troops ashore. An Iraqi battery at al-Finţās fired two Silkworms at the formation of allied ships, at 0452 on 25 February 1991. One of the Silkworms misfired and crashed into the sea shortly after the Iraqis launched it, but the other missile hurtled toward &quot;Missouri&quot; at 605 knots and a height of 375 feet above the water. The U.S. and British ships tracked the incoming missile on their radar. From the bridge of the Jarrett, Lt. Craig Isaacson ordered chaff, torchs, and decoys to be launched to confound the missile&#x27;s guidance. &quot;Missouri&quot; also fired its SRBOC chaff at this time. The Phalanx CIWS system on &quot;Jarrett&quot;, operating in the automatic target-acquisition mode, fixed on &quot;Missouri&quot;″s chaff, releasing a burst of rounds. From this burst, four rounds hit &quot;Missouri&quot; which was from &quot;Jarrett&quot; at the time. There were no injuries. &quot;Gloucester&quot; shot down the missile with two Sea Dart surface-to-air missiles.

Later, &quot;Missouri&quot; launched a Pioneer RPV that discovered the Iraqi Silkworm battery and the battleship fired 30 16-inch rounds and knocked out the battery. After the cease-fire, &quot;Jarrett&quot; escorted merchant ships through &quot;mine danger areas&quot; (1 March–14 April).

===31 January 2000===

Alaska Airlines Flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 airliner, crashed into the Pacific north of Anacapa Island, California, killing all 88 people on board, on 31 January 2000. A Lockheed NP-3D Orion from Point Mugu, California, two Sikorsky HH-60H Seahawks from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HCS) 5 from Point Mugu, and Coast Guard helos and a Lockheed HC-130H Hercules responded. Aircraft carrier supported rescue crews, and Navy mapping with underwater side scanning sonar and video enabled the searchers to recover pieces of wreckage. Reinforcements included amphibious transport dock , destroyer and &quot;Jarrett&quot;, these ships embarked HH-60 and SH-60 Seahawks, and a Lockheed S-3B Viking from Naval Air Station North Island.

The ship may have been assigned to a Destroyer squadron that formed part of Carrier Strike Group Three after 2004.

===11 May–19 October 2009===

The ship, with HSL-49 Detachment 3 and Pacific Tactical Law Enforcement Detachment 101 embarked (followed by 107), sailed on a counter-narcotics deployment to the Eastern Pacific. Her operations resulted in the seizure or disruption of the smuggling of over nine tons of narcotics with an estimated street value of $266 million.

== Current status ==
On 21 April 2011, &quot;Jarrett&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Base San Diego after 15 deployments, and was transported to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard as its final destination, becoming part of the Mothball Fleet. The ship&#x27;s most recent deployment was a six-month counter-illicit trafficking deployment, supporting U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command. In 2015, this ship was scrapped.

&quot;Jarrett&quot; was the first ship of that name in the US Navy.

<text>The problem play is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of realism in the arts, especially following the innovations of Henrik Ibsen. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context. Critic Chris Baldick writes that the genre emerged &quot;from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen&#x27;s realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts.&quot; He summarises it as follows:

The critic F. S. Boas adapted the term to characterise certain plays by William Shakespeare that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen&#x27;s 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any tragicomic dramas that do not fit easily into the classical generic distinction between comedy and tragedy.

==Early &quot;problem plays&quot;==
While plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and satyr plays, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as Euripides&#x27; &quot;Alcestis&quot;.

==Shakespeare==
Boas used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements: &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. He wrote that &quot;throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome.&quot; Later critics have used the term for other plays, including &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;.

==19th-century drama==

While social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as Alexandre Dumas, fils, who dealt with the subject of prostitution in &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot; (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day: &quot;No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth.&quot;

The most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women&#x27;s lives in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1882) and provincial greed in &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; (1882). Ibsen&#x27;s dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by George Bernard Shaw and other later dramatists.

==20th century==
The genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton&#x27;s &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot; (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the &#x27;problem&#x27;. This &quot;resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle&quot; starts with the &#x27;problem&#x27; of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected due to her status as a victim of seduction: &quot;the &#x27;problem&#x27; is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden&#x27;s tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman&#x27;s future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment.&quot;

In America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as Angelina Weld Grimké&#x27;s, &quot;Rachel&quot;. It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede&#x27;s &quot;Paragraph 218&quot; (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by Erwin Piscator.

<doc id="726915" wikidata="Q861345" url="?curid=726915" title="Alkaline battery">
<text>An alkaline battery (IEC code: L) is a type of primary battery where the electrolyte (most commonly potassium hydroxide) has a pH value above 7. Typically, these batteries derive energy from the reaction between zinc metal and manganese dioxide.

Compared with zinc–carbon batteries of the Leclanché cell or zinc chloride types, alkaline batteries have a higher energy density and longer shelf life yet provide the same voltage.

The alkaline battery gets its name because it has an alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide (KOH) instead of the acidic ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) or zinc chloride (ZnCl2) electrolyte of the zinc–carbon batteries. Other battery systems also use alkaline electrolytes, but they use different active materials for the electrodes.

 alkaline batteries accounted for 80% of manufactured batteries in the US and over 10 billion individual units produced worldwide. In Japan, alkaline batteries accounted for 46% of all primary battery sales. In Switzerland, alkaline batteries accounted for 68%, in the UK 60% and in the EU 47% of all battery sales including secondary types. 

Alkaline batteries contain zinc (Zn) and manganese dioxide (MnO2), which is a cumulative neurotoxin and can be toxic in higher concentrations. However, compared to other battery types, the toxicity of alkaline batteries is moderate.

Alkaline batteries are used in many household items such as portable media players, digital cameras, toys, flashlights, and radios.

==History==

Batteries with alkaline (rather than acid) electrolyte were first developed by Waldemar Jungner in 1899, and, working independently, Thomas Edison in 1901. The modern alkaline dry battery, using the zinc/manganese dioxide chemistry, was invented by the Canadian engineer Lewis Urry in the 1950s in Canada before he started working for Union Carbide&#x27;s Eveready Battery division in Cleveland, OH, building on earlier work by Edison. On October 9, 1957, Urry, Karl Kordesch, and P. A. Marsal filed US patent (2,960,558) for the alkaline battery. It was granted in 1960 and was assigned to the Union Carbide Corporation.

When alkaline batteries were introduced in the late 1960s, their zinc electrodes (in common with the then ubiquitous carbon-zinc cells) had a surface film of mercury amalgam. Its purpose was to control electrolytic action on impurities in the zinc; that unwanted electrolytic action would reduce shelf life and promote leakage. When reductions in mercury content were mandated by various legislatures, it became necessary to greatly improve the purity and consistency of the zinc.

==Chemistry==
In an alkaline battery, the negative electrode is zinc and the positive electrode is manganese dioxide (MnO2). The alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide (KOH) is not consumed during the reaction (it is regenerated), only the zinc and MnO2 are consumed during discharge. The concentration of alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide remains constant, as there are equal amounts of OH− anions consumed and produced in the two half-reactions occurring at the electrodes.

The two half-reactions are:

* Anode (oxidation reaction), negatively charged electrode because accepting from the reductant in the cell: 
* Cathode (reduction reaction), positively charged electrode because giving to the oxidizer in the cell:

The overall reaction (sum of anodic and cathodic reactions) is:
==Capacity==
The capacity of an alkaline battery is strongly dependent on the load. An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective capacity of at low drain, but at a load of , which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could be as little as . The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the cutoff voltage of the application.

==Voltage==
The nominal voltage of a fresh alkaline cell as established by manufacturer standards is . The zero-load voltage of a new alkaline battery ranges from , depending on the purity of the manganese dioxide used and the contents of zinc oxide in the electrolyte. The voltage delivered to a load decreases as the current drawn increases and as the cell discharges. A cell is considered fully discharged when the voltage drops to about . Cells connected in series produce a voltage equal to the sum of the voltages of each cell (e.g., three cells generate about 4.5 V when new).

==Current==
The amount of electrical current an alkaline battery can deliver is roughly proportional to its physical size. This is a result of decreasing internal resistance as the internal surface area of the cell increases. A rule of thumb is that an AA alkaline battery can deliver without any significant heating. Larger cells, such as C and D cells, can deliver more current. Applications requiring currents of several amperes such as powerful portable audio equipment require D-sized cells to handle the increased load. 

In comparison, Lithium-ion and Ni-MH batteries can handle with ease on the standard AA size.

==Construction==

Alkaline batteries are manufactured in standard cylindrical forms interchangeable with zinc–carbon batteries, and in button forms. Several individual cells may be interconnected to form a true &quot;battery&quot;, such as the 9-volt PP3-size battery.

A cylindrical cell is contained in a drawn stainless steel can, which is the cathode connection. The positive electrode mixture is a compressed paste of manganese dioxide with carbon powder added for increased conductivity. The paste may be pressed into the can or deposited as pre-molded rings. The hollow center of the cathode is lined with a separator, which prevents contact of the electrode materials and short-circuiting of the cell. The separator is made of a non-woven layer of cellulose or a synthetic polymer. The separator must conduct ions and remain stable in the highly alkaline electrolyte solution.

The negative electrode is composed of a dispersion of zinc powder in a gel containing the potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The zinc powder provides more surface area for chemical reactions to take place, compared to a metal can. This lowers the internal resistance of the cell. To prevent gassing of the cell at the end of its life, more manganese dioxide is used than required to react with all the zinc. Also, a plastic-made gasket is usually added to increase leakage resistance.

The cell is then wrapped in aluminium foil, a plastic film, or rarely, cardboard, which acts as a final layer of leak protection as well as providing a surface on which logos and labels can be printed.

When describing AAA, AA, C, sub-C and D size cells, the negative electrode is connected to the flat end, and the positive terminal is the end with the raised button. This is usually reversed in button cells, with the flat-ended cylindrical can being the positive terminal.

==Recharging of alkaline batteries==
Some alkaline batteries are designed to be recharged a few times, and are described as rechargeable alkaline batteries. Attempts to recharge standard alkaline batteries may cause rupture, or the leaking of hazardous liquids that corrode the equipment. However, it is reported that standard alkaline batteries can often be recharged a few times (typically not more than ten), albeit with reduced capacity after each charge; chargers are available commercially. The UK consumer organisation &quot;Which?&quot; reported that it tested two such chargers with Energizer alkaline batteries, finding that battery capacity dropped on average to 10% of its original value, with huge variations, after two cycles (without stating how depleted they were before recharging) after recharging them two times.

In 2017 Gautam G. Yadav published papers reporting that alkaline batteries made by interleaving the interlayers with copper ions could be recharged for over 6,000 cycles due to the theoretical second electron capacity of manganese dioxide. The energy density of these rechargeable batteries with copper intercalated manganese dioxide is reported to be over , the best among the aqueous-based chemistries. It could be capable of energy densities comparable to lithium-ion (at least ) if zinc utilization in the batteries were improved.

==Leaks==
Alkaline batteries are prone to leaking potassium hydroxide, a caustic agent that can cause respiratory, eye and skin irritation. The risk of this can be reduced by storing batteries in a dry place and at room temperature. Damage from leakage is mitigated by removing batteries when storing devices. Applying reverse current (such as by recharging disposable-grade cells, or by mixing batteries of different types or state of charge in the same device) can increase the risk of leakage. 

All batteries gradually self-discharge (whether installed in a device or not) and dead batteries eventually leak. Extremely high temperatures can also cause batteries to rupture and leak (such as in a car during summer) as well as decrease the shelf life of the battery.

The reason for leaks is that as batteries dischargeeither through usage or gradual self-dischargethe chemistry of the cells changes and some hydrogen gas is generated. This out-gassing increases pressure in the battery. Eventually, the excess pressure either ruptures the insulating seals at the end of the battery, or the outer metal canister, or both. In addition, as the battery ages, its steel outer canister may gradually corrode or rust, which can further contribute to containment failure.

Once a leak has formed due to corrosion of the outer steel shell, potassium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air to form a feathery crystalline structure of potassium carbonate that grows and spreads out from the battery over time, following along metal electrodes to circuit boards where it commences oxidation of copper tracks and other components, leading to permanent circuitry damage.

The leaking crystalline growths can also emerge from seams around battery covers to form a furry coating outside the device, that corrodes any objects in contact with the leaking device.

==Disposal==
Since alkaline batteries were made with less mercury beginning in 1996, alkaline batteries are allowed to be disposed of as regular domestic waste in some locations. However, older alkaline batteries with mercury, and the remaining other heavy metals and corrosive chemicals in all batteries (new and old), still present problems for disposal—especially in landfills. There is also the issue of simplifying the disposal of batteries by excluding them all from domestic waste, so that the most toxic batteries are diverted from general waste streams.

Disposal varies by jurisdiction. For example, the state of California considers all batteries as hazardous waste when discarded, and has banned the disposal of batteries in domestic waste. In Europe, battery disposal is controlled by the WEEE Directive and Battery Directive regulations, and as such alkaline batteries must not be thrown in with domestic waste. In the EU, most stores that sell batteries are required by law to accept old batteries for recycling.

===Recycling===
The disposable battery market grows at a rate of 5.5% every year. In the past, used batteries ended up at landfill sites, but in 2004, disposal of alkaline batteries at landfill sites was forbidden by an EU regulation. In 2006, the EU committed to recycling 45% of all batteries by 2016. In 2023, a new regulation set a target of 63% by 2027 and 73% by 2036.

In the US, only one state, California, requires all alkaline batteries to be recycled. Vermont also has a statewide alkaline battery collection program. In other US states, individuals can purchase battery recycling kits used to ship batteries to recyclers. Some stores such as IKEA also collect alkaline batteries for recycling. However, some chain stores that advertise battery recycling (such as Best Buy) accept rechargeable batteries only, and generally do not accept alkaline batteries.

For recycling, the metals from crushed alkaline batteries are mechanically separated, and the waste black mass is treated chemically to separate zinc, manganese dioxide and potassium hydroxide.

<doc id="726921" wikidata="Q979532" url="?curid=726921" title="XML Signature">
<text>XML Signature (also called &quot;XMLDSig&quot;, &quot;XML-DSig&quot;, &quot;XML-Sig&quot;) defines an XML syntax for digital signatures and is defined in the W3C recommendation XML Signature Syntax and Processing. Functionally, it has much in common with PKCS #7 but is more extensible and geared towards signing XML documents. It is used by various Web technologies such as SOAP, SAML, and others.

XML signatures can be used to sign data–a resource–of any type, typically XML documents, but anything that is accessible via a URL can be signed. An XML signature used to sign a resource outside its containing XML document is called a detached signature; if it is used to sign some part of its containing document, it is called an enveloped signature; if it contains the signed data within itself it is called an enveloping signature.

== Structure ==
An XML Signature consists of a codice_1 element in the codice_2 namespace. The basic structure is as follows:
&lt;Signature&gt;
 &lt;SignedInfo&gt;
 &lt;CanonicalizationMethod /&gt;
 &lt;SignatureMethod /&gt;
 &lt;Reference&gt;
 &lt;Transforms /&gt;
 &lt;DigestMethod /&gt;
 &lt;DigestValue /&gt;
 &lt;/Reference&gt;
 &lt;Reference /&gt; etc.
 &lt;/SignedInfo&gt;
 &lt;SignatureValue /&gt;
 &lt;KeyInfo /&gt;
 &lt;Object /&gt;
&lt;/Signature&gt;
* The codice_3 element contains or references the signed data and specifies what algorithms are used.
** The codice_4 and codice_5 elements are used by the codice_6 element and are included in codice_3 to protect them from tampering.
** One or more codice_8 elements specify the resource being signed by URI reference and any transformations to be applied to the resource prior to signing.
*** codice_9 contains the transformations applied to the resource prior to signing. A transformation can be a XPath-expression that selects a defined subset of the document tree.
*** codice_10 specifies the hash algorithm before applying the hash.
*** codice_11 contains the Base64 encoded result of applying the hash algorithm to the transformed resource(s) defined in the codice_8 element attributes.
* The codice_6 element contains the Base64 encoded signature result - the signature generated with the parameters specified in the codice_4 element - of the codice_3 element after applying the algorithm specified by the codice_5.
* codice_17 element optionally allows the signer to provide recipients with the key that validates the signature, usually in the form of one or more X.509 digital certificates. The relying party must identify the key from context if codice_17 is not present.
* The codice_19 element (optional) contains the signed data if this is an &quot;enveloping signature&quot;.

== Validation and security considerations ==
When validating an XML Signature, a procedure called Core Validation is followed.

# Reference Validation: Each codice_8&#x27;s digest is verified by retrieving the corresponding resource and applying any transforms and then the specified digest method to it. The result is compared to the recorded codice_11; if they do not match, validation fails.
# Signature Validation: The codice_3 element is serialized using the canonicalization method specified in codice_5, the key data is retrieved using codice_17 or by other means, and the signature is verified using the method specified in codice_4.

This procedure establishes whether the resources were really signed by the alleged party. However, because of the extensibility of the canonicalization and transform methods, the verifying party must also make sure that what was actually signed or digested is really what was present in the original data, in other words, that the algorithms used there can be trusted not to change the meaning of the signed data.

Because the signed document&#x27;s structure can be tampered with leading to &quot;signature wrapping&quot; attacks, the validation process should also cover XML document structure. Signed element and signature element should be selected using absolute XPath expression, not codice_26 methods.

== XML canonicalization ==
The creation of XML Signatures is substantially more complex than the creation of an ordinary digital signature because a given XML Document (an &quot;Infoset&quot;, in common usage among XML developers) may have more than one legal serialized representation. For example, whitespace inside an XML Element is not syntactically significant, so that codice_27 is syntactically identical to codice_28.

Since the digital signature ensures data integrity, a single-byte difference would cause the signature to vary. Moreover, if an XML document is transferred from computer to computer, the line terminator may be changed from CR to LF to CR LF, etc. A program that digests and validates an XML document may later render the XML document in a different way, e.g. adding excess space between attribute definitions with an element definition, or using relative (vs. absolute) URLs, or by reordering namespace definitions. Canonical XML is especially important when an XML Signature refers to a remote document, which may be rendered in time-varying ways by an errant remote server.

To avoid these problems and guarantee that logically-identical XML documents give identical digital signatures, an XML canonicalization transform (frequently abbreviated C14n) is employed when signing XML documents (for signing the codice_3, a canonicalization is mandatory). These algorithms guarantee that semantically-identical documents produce exactly identical serialized representations.

Another complication arises because of the way that the default canonicalization algorithm handles namespace declarations; frequently a signed XML document needs to be embedded in another document; in this case the original canonicalization algorithm will not yield the same result as if the document is treated alone. For this reason, the so-called &quot;Exclusive Canonicalization&quot;, which serializes XML namespace declarations independently of the surrounding XML, was created.

== Benefits ==
XML Signature is more flexible than other forms of digital signatures such as Pretty Good Privacy and Cryptographic Message Syntax, because it does not operate on binary data, but on the XML Infoset, allowing to work on subsets of the data (this is also possible with binary data in non-standard ways, for example encoding blocks of binary data in base64 ASCII), having various ways to bind the signature and signed information, and perform transformations. Another core concept is canonicalization, that is to sign only the &quot;essence&quot;, eliminating meaningless differences like whitespace and line endings.

== Issues ==
There are criticisms directed at the architecture of XML security in general, and at the suitability of XML canonicalization in particular as a front end to signing and encrypting XML data due to its complexity, inherent processing requirement, and poor performance characteristics. The argument is that performing XML canonicalization causes excessive latency that is simply too much to overcome for transactional, performance sensitive SOA applications.

These issues are being addressed in the XML Security Working Group.

Without proper policy and implementation the use of XML Dsig in SOAP and WS-Security can lead to vulnerabilities, such as XML signature wrapping.

== Applications ==
An example of applications of XML Signatures:
* Digital signing of XBRL annual reports by auditors in the Netherlands. A PKIoverheid X.509 certificate, approved by the , is required. The electronic signature is legally binding. The SBR Assurance standard is part of the Dutch Standard Business Reporting program.

<text>USS &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; (FFG-34), the twenty-sixth ship of the of guided-missile frigates, was named for Vice-Admiral Aubrey Fitch (1883–1978), who was noted for his outstanding command work in the South Pacific during World War II.

Ordered on 23 January 1978, as a part of the FY-1978 program, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; was laid down on 10 April 1981 at the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine. She was launched on 17 October 1981—sponsored by Mrs. Francesca Fitch Ferguson, the granddaughter of the late Admiral Fitch—and was commissioned in Bath, Maine, on 9 October 1982.

This warship was decommissioned on 12 December 1997 and stricken from the Navy&#x27;s list on 3 May 1999.

==1982==
After commissioning, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; remained at Bath for another five weeks completing her outfitting, propulsion plant testing, and sailors&#x27; training. In mid-November, she made the passage from Bath to her home port, Mayport, Florida, where she spent the remainder of 1982. She was the final &quot;Short-Hull&quot; &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class guided-missile frigate to be built, the rest were &quot;Long-Hulls&quot;.

==1983==
Early in January 1983, the guided-missile frigate embarked upon her shakedown cruise to the vicinity of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The warship returned to Mayport during the middle of February and then launched into a series of trials, qualifications, and certifications preparatory to her final acceptance by the Navy. She completed final acceptance trials late in May and entered the yard at Bath Iron Works for a three-month, post-shakedown availability. &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; completed repairs and returned to Mayport in September. In October, she commenced refresher training out of Guantánamo Bay.

The guided-missile frigate was so engaged when United States military forces invaded the small Caribbean island nation of Grenada on 25 October. &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; interrupted refresher training to conduct patrols in defense of the base at Guantánamo Bay against possible hostile action by Cuba as a result of the conflict in Grenada.

Early in November, however the warship completed refresher training and assumed tactical control of and for the purpose of testing the feasibility of operating guided-missile frigates and guided-missile hydrofoil gunboats together in the same task organization. Demands attendant to the continuing American presence in Grenada, however, overtook the experiment and sent &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; and her two consorts south to the tiny republic. Duty in the waters adjacent to Grenada lasted until mid-December when the warship returned to Mayport.

==1984==
&quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; began 1984 in her home port. Later in January, she embarked upon a normal schedule of training operations in the West Indies. That employment occupied her through the month of May and into June. On 22 June, the guided missile frigate put to sea to become a unit of NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force, Atlantic, based at Plymouth, England. That deployment included visits to a number of ports in northern Europe as well as training evolutions in the Baltic Sea. Early in the fall of 1984, the NATO force visited American waters and made calls at Charleston, Savannah, and New Orleans. Late in November, the warships visited &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot;″s home port in Florida. Early in December, the NATO force headed back to Europe, leaving &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; at Mayport.

==1985==
The warship opened 1985 much the same way as she did 1984. After concluding holiday leave and upkeep at Mayport during the first half of January, she returned to sea for the usual training exercises, equipment operation certifications, and ASW helicopter landing qualifications. These and similar evolutions alternated with periods in port for routine upkeep and availability occupied her time during the first five months of the year. In June, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; began providing escort and plane guard services for and when the carriers put to sea to conduct landing qualifications.

Near the end of June, she put to sea for special operations off the west coast of the Isthmus of Panama. She transited the Panama Canal and then operated from PSA Panama International Terminal during July, August, and part of September. After passing back through the canal in mid-September, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; arrived back at Mayport on the 21st. Repairs took up the remainder of September as well as October and November. She concluded her restricted availability with sea trials on 5 and 6 December and, after a brief round trip to Charleston and back, settled into the usual year-end holiday routine.

==1986==
The relative inactivity of holiday standdown carried over into the first three weeks of 1986. On 21 January, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; put to sea for a week of ASW training in the Bahama Islands. On 28 January, she interrupted her return voyage when the disintegrated soon after launch. From her position just 50 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; rushed to the scene of the tragedy and began recovering debris. She collected several tons of material which she later delivered to Cape Canaveral to be inspected as a part of the investigation into the cause of the disaster. From Cape Canaveral the guided-missile frigate returned to Mayport and remained there until the second week in February. On 10 February, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; resumed training operations out of Mayport, and she continued so employed until the beginning of April at which time the warship began preparations to deploy to the Persian Gulf.

On 4 June, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; stood out of Mayport in company with the frigate to rendezvous with the destroyers and . She and her traveling companions then laid in a course that took them across the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, through the Suez Canal, and around the Arabian Peninsula to the Strait of Hormuz. &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; and her consorts arrived at Bahrain in the Persian Gulf on 8 July. The guided-missile frigate spent the next four months conducting patrols and escorting merchant ships in the strategic–and troubled–waters of the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, and the northern portion of the Arabian Sea. No untoward events marred her sojourn in the region, and she concluded her assignment on 30 October by turning her responsibilities over to the destroyer . Retracing her outward-bound voyage via the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; steamed into Mayport on 4 December. Post-deployment standdown took up the remainder of 1986.

==1987–1997==
Over the next ten years, Aubrey Fitch continued to the Middle East and the West Indies. During a 1988 deployment to the Persian Gulf, the frigate participated in Operation Earnest Will, during which she conducted escort missions to protect Kuwaiti merchant tankers from attack during the Iran–Iraq War. In December 1990 the warship conducted counter-narcotics patrols in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, and received a Joint Meritorious Unit Award for her efforts. In July 1991, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; hosted the Soviet guided missile destroyer during a visit to Mayport.

In August 1991, following the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraqi Army, the frigate surged to the Middle East to participate in Maritime Interception Operations (MIO) in the northern Red Sea. Designed to cut the flow of supplies and equipment to Iraq in support of United Nations&#x27; economic sanctions, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; conducted 243 merchant ship boardings and inspected over 3 million tons of cargo. The ship received a Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation for this performance.

In February 1993 the frigate participated in Operation Able Manner, in support of migration interdiction efforts off Haiti, receiving the Coast Guard Special Operations Service Ribbon for developing baseline procedures for conducting mass lifesaving operations.

In 1994, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; carried out two deployments to Haiti in support of Operation Uphold Democracy, where the crew boarded over 50 ships to enforce economic sanctions against the government and provided security and search-and-rescue support for operations within Port-au-Prince Harbor.

In the summer of 1995, the frigate sailed to Europe both to conduct NATO training exercises and to participate in the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Atlantic and the end of the war in Europe.

&quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; spent March through July 1995 touring Western Europe, including Bermuda; Brest, France; Rota, Barcelona and Ibiza, Spain; Casablanca, Morocco; Gibraltar, Portsmouth &amp; Liverpool, UK; Lisbon, Portugal; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Derry &amp; Portrush, Northern Ireland and Rosyth, Scotland.

From September 1996 to March 1997, &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; conducted her last operational deployment as part of Standing Naval Force Atlantic, during which she visited fourteen ports ranging between Gdynia, Poland west to Faslane, Scotland and south to Lisbon, Portugal.

&quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; was decommissioned on 12 December 1997 and towed to the former Philadelphia Naval Yard as part of the inactive reserve fleet. She had the shortest active career of any of the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class ships at 15 years, and was stricken on 3 May 1999, just two years later into unmaintained (Category-X) status to await scrap sale. &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; was transferred to Metro Machine Corp. for scrapping, on 26 March 2004.

&quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; (FFG-34) was the first ship with this name in the U.S. Navy.

<text>The West Indian whistling duck (Dendrocygna arborea) is a whistling duck that breeds in the Caribbean. Alternative names are black-billed whistling duck and Cuban whistling duck.

==Taxonomy==
The West Indian whistling duck was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas arborea&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the descriptions by earlier authors. In 1725 the Irish physician, naturalist and collector Hans Sloane had described and illustrated the &quot;Whistling-Duck&quot; in the second volume of his &quot;A Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica&quot;. Sloane noted that it was common on the island of Jamaica. The English naturalist George Edwards had included a description and a hand-coloured illustration of the &quot;Black-bill&#x27;d whistling Duck&quot; in the fourth volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot; that was published in 1751. Edwards had been able to examine a specimen at the home of Admiral Sir Charles Wager at Stanley House in Chelsea, west London.

The West Indian whistling duck is now one of eight species placed in the genus &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; that was introduced in 1837 by the English naturalist William Swainson. The species is treated as monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;dendron&quot; meaning &quot;tree&quot; with the genus &quot;Cygnus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;arborea&quot; is from Latin &quot;arboreus&quot; meaning &quot;tree&quot;.

==Description==
The West Indian whistling duck is the largest and darkest of the whistling ducks with a length of . The female weighs from and the male weighs from ; this species is about the size of a mallard. It has a long black bill, long head and longish legs. It has a pale foreneck and light brown face. The crown, back, breast and wings are dark brown to black, and the rest of the underparts are white with heavy black markings.

All plumages are similar, except that juveniles are duller and have a less contrasted belly pattern.

==Distribution==
The West Indian whistling duck is widely scattered throughout the West Indies, including a large breeding population in the Bahamas, and smaller numbers in Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica, Hispaniola (both the Dominican Republic and Haiti), and Puerto Rico. It is largely sedentary, apart from local movements, which can be 100 km or more.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Nests have been reported in tree cavities, on branches, in clumps of bromeliads, and on the ground under thatch palms and other dense bushes. The usual clutch size is 10–16 eggs. It habitually perches in trees, which gives rise to its specific name.

===Food and feeding===
The birds are mostly nocturnal and secretive, inhabiting wooded swamps and mangroves, where this duck roosts and feeds on plant food including the fruit of the royal palm.

== Threats ==
The West Indian whistling duck has suffered extensive hunting for its eggs and for sport. Wetlands are a very limited habitat in the Caribbean, with continuing conversion for development and agriculture. More than 50% of remaining wetlands are seriously degraded by the cutting of mangroves and swamp-forest, pollution (especially over-use of pesticides1) and natural catastrophes such as droughts and hurricanes. Predation is inadequately documented but may be a factor.

== Current conservation measures ==
&quot;D. arborea&quot; is ranked under CITES Appendix II, as well as CMS Appendix II. It is legally protected throughout much of its range, but law enforcement is inadequate. The West Indian Whistling Duck Working Group initiated a conservation programme in 1997. There are several protected areas in the region but, in general, suitable habitat, especially wetlands, is under-represented. Ducks are predated on Antigua and Barbuda by the small Indian mongooses introduced to control the cane rats which was largely unsuccessful as the rats live in trees.

== Proposed conservation measures ==
Conduct extensive surveys to assess numbers and distribution; assist local authorities in establishing a long-term monitoring programme; conserve key sites; enforce legal protection; initiate public education and awareness programmes.

<doc id="726928" wikidata="Q313239" url="?curid=726928" title="Alpha Oumar Konaré">
<text>Alpha Oumar Konaré (born 2 February 1946) is a Malian politician, professor, historian and archaeologist, who served as President of Mali for two five-year terms from 1992 to 2002 and was Chairperson of the African Union Commission from 2003 to 2008.

==Scholarly career==
Alpha Oumar Konaré, fourth son of a Fula homemaker, was born in Kayes, Mali, where he went to primary school. He went on to attend Bamako&#x27;s &quot;Lycée Terrasson des Fougères&quot;, the &quot;Collège de Maristes&quot; of Dakar, Senegal, the &quot;Collège Moderne&quot; of Kayes and, between 1962 and 1964, the &quot;École Normale Secondaire&quot; of Katibougou. He completed his advanced studies in history at the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot; in Bamako (1965–1969), at the University of Warsaw between 1971 and 1975 and at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.

He began his professional career as a tutor in Kayes, then a lycée teacher at Markala and Bamako. In 1974, he did research at the &quot;Institut des Sciences Humaines du Mali,&quot; then, from 1975 to 1978, acted as head of historic patrimony and ethnography at the Ministry of Youth, Sports, Arts, and Culture. In 1980, he was named researcher at the &quot;Institut Supérieur de Formation en Recherche Appliquée&quot; (I.S.F.R.A), and Professor at the History/Geography department at the Ecole Normale Supérieure of Bamako. In the course of his career, he headed several professional organizations, including the Association of Historians and Geographers of Mali, the West African Association of Archaeologists, and the Union of West African Researchers. Between 1981 and 1992, Konaré served as a consultant for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Between 1989 and 1992 he was president of ICOM (International Council of Museums; https://web.archive.org/web/20081221013404/http://icom.museum/founders.html#presidents ).

==Political activism==
Konaré was involved in politics as early as the age of twenty, when he was elected the 1967 Secretary General of the Sudanese Union/African Democratic Rally (US-RDA, the party of President Modibo Keïta) of the École Normale Supérieure of Bamako.

Following the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of General Moussa Traoré, he became an activist for the Marxist-Leninist, clandestine Malian Party for Work (&quot;Parti malien du travail&quot;, or PMT).

In 1978, however, he accepted a post in Moussa Traoré&#x27;s government as Minister of Youth, Sports, Arts, and Culture. Though he resigned in 1980, his term was marked by the formation of many Malian sports organizations. He went on to found and direct the cultural review &quot;Jamana&quot; in 1983, as well as the cultural cooperative of the same name. In 1989 he also founded the daily newspaper Les échos, and in 1991 began &quot;Radio Bamakan,&quot; Mali&#x27;s first free radio station.

==ADEMA and presidency==
In 1990, he participated in the creation of the umbrella movement Alliance for Democracy in Mali (&quot;Alliance pour la démocratie au Mali&quot;, or ADEMA), which united the PMT with a number of other anti-Traoré groups. With the 1991 fall of Moussa Traoré, Konaré helped transform ADEMA into ADEMA/PASJ, an official political party, and served as its delegate to the 1991 National Conference of Mali.

By the end of the democratic transition instituted by Amadou Toumani Touré, he was elected as Mali&#x27;s first elected president in 1992, receiving 69.01% of the vote in the second round against US-RDA candidate Tiéoulé Mamadou Konaté. He was re-elected for a second term in the 1997 presidential election despite a boycott of the ballot in protest of his annulment of legislative elections, and he was sworn in on 8 June 1997.

His terms are noted for the restoration of democracy in spite of the 1997 difficulties, his management of the Tuareg Rebellion in the north, and his decentralization of the government. However, corruption remained a significant problem under Konaré&#x27;s administration.

Konaré publicly rendered homage to Mali&#x27;s first president, Modibo Keïta, and created a memorial to him in Bamako. Opposed to the death penalty, he commuted the death sentences of Moussa Traoré and his wife to life in prison in 2002. He is also remembered as the man who brought the continent&#x27;s most prestigious football tournament, the African Cup of Nations, to Mali in 2002.

On the international stage, Konaré worked for peace and integration in the West African region. He served as president of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1999, and of the West African Monetary Union (UEMOA) in 2000.

Term limited to two presidential terms by the constitution, Konaré left office in 2002 and was succeeded by Amadou Toumani Touré. To date, he is the only Malian president to leave office at the end of his term. On 10 July 2003, he was elected as Chairman of the Commission of the African Union (AU) at a summit in Maputo. He was the only candidate; Amara Essy, who held the post in an interim capacity, withdrew his candidacy prior to the vote. 35 countries voted in Konaré&#x27;s favor; there were six votes against him, while four countries abstained.

Konaré raised the ire of civil society in Zimbabwe when, during a visit to Harare on 14 October 2006, in his capacity as Chairperson of the AU Commission, he declined invitations to meet with representatives of non-governmental organizations to discuss the situation in Zimbabwe.

On 25 January 2007, Konaré said that he did not intend to seek another term as chairman of the AU Commission. On 1 February 2008, Jean Ping of Gabon was elected to succeed him; Ping officially succeeded Konaré as Chairperson of the commission on 28 April 2008.

== After the presidency ==
In September 2021, Alpha Oumar Konaré, was urgently hospitalized in Morocco at Cheikh Zaid Hospital in Rabat.

<text>Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi (; 1920 – 7 July 1981) was the first President of the People&#x27;s Republic of South Yemen. Al-Shaabi&#x27;s National Liberation Front (NLF) political organisation wrested control of the country from the British and won political supremacy over the opposition Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) in 1967. On 30 November 1967, the Protectorate of South Arabia was declared independent as the People&#x27;s Republic of South Yemen, with al-Shaabi as President. Al-Shaabi held the presidency until 22 June 1969, when a hard-line Marxist group from within his own NLF seized control. He was replaced by Salim Rubai Ali and jailed, then placed under house arrest until the 1970s, and lived quietly in Aden from his release until his death in 1981.

Al-Shaabi was originally an agricultural officer from Lahej who fled to Cairo in 1958. In 1962, he was announced the head of a National Liberation Army, formed in Egypt, and in 1963 or 1965, he was chosen the founding head of the NLF. Upon independence in 1967, he was the best-known NLF leader and the only one over 40 years old. As part of the Nasserist nationalist right-leaning faction of the NLF, he fought the Marxist left wing for a year and a half until his ouster in the 22 June Corrective Move, also known as the Glorious Corrective Move, in 1969. The government declared in 1990 that the deposition was &quot;in the absence of true democracy&quot;.

Qahtan&#x27;s son Najib Qahtan al-Shaabi ran unsuccessfully against President Ali Abdullah Saleh in the 1999 Yemeni presidential election.

<doc id="726938" wikidata="Q2118694" url="?curid=726938" title="Puppetry of the Penis">
<text>Puppetry of the Penis is a comedic live performance-art show featuring a series of genital contortions. The show was initially conceived as the title of a highbrow art calendar released by Australian Simon Morley in 1996. The calendar showcased twelve penis &quot;installations&quot; (the manipulation of male genitalia into a variety of recognisable forms). In response to increasing requests for live demonstrations, in 1997 Morley enlisted fellow Australian, David &quot;Friendy&quot; Friend, to devise a performance show consisting of body-based genital comedy.

The show involves two nude men who bend, twist, and fold their penises and scrotums into various shapes. The theatrical contortion of the male genitalia accompanied by comedic narration has since spread internationally. It is humorously termed &quot;dick trick&quot; or &quot;genital origami.&quot;

&quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; was first performed on stage at the 1998 Melbourne International Comedy Festival in Australia, featuring the creators, Morley and Friend, as the premiere cast. The show has since appeared on the international stage, featuring productions in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Europe, Canada, the United States, South Africa and Argentina. The initial Australian tour was the subject of Australian comedian Mick Molloy&#x27;s 2000 documentary &quot;Tackle Happy&quot;. The duo has recruited supporting production teams and actors across Australia, the UK and the U.S., allowing international performance demands to be met. Due to the success of the show, the business was expanded to cater for private parties around Australia.

A &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; TV special has aired in Australia on One.

== Background ==
In 1996, Australian comedian Simon Morley created an art calendar that showcased close-up images of twelve penis &#x27;installations&#x27;. The concept was based on Morley and his youngest brother&#x27;s creation of a series of party tricks involving various contortions of their genitalia. In order to market the calendars, Morley devised a live routine. Morley&#x27;s first demonstration, held in a garage in 1997, was received well by audience members, and encouraged him to pursue the creation of a stage show in which to showcase the tricks. Morley originally intended to recruit his brother to perform the act alongside him, however he had already committed to a part on the Australian TV show Neighbours. Morley enlisted David &quot;Friendy&quot; Friend, a Melbourne resident who had previously run a small entertainment business that catered to bachelorette parties, as his stage partner, and together they developed a comedy routine based on Morley&#x27;s original concept. The title of the calendar, &#x27;Puppetry of the Penis&#x27;, was the inspiration for the title of the subsequent performance show, which featured a repertoire of similar contortions.

== Summary ==

The run-time for the performance is approximately one hour. The main acts are preceded by a 25-minute stand-up comedy act, with varying comedians in different productions. The majority of the show features a series of &#x27;tricks&#x27;, which are manipulations of the actors&#x27; penises into various forms. The creators describe this as &quot;genital origami&quot;. The contortions simulate commonly identifiable shapes, such as objects, architecture and people. The tricks include the Big Mac, the Loch Ness Monster, the wristwatch, the pelican, the Eiffel Tower, the hamburger, the bulldog, the windsurfer and others. The show consists of approximately 45 genital manipulations, accompanied by sound effects and comedic narration.

The performers wear only sneakers and velvet magician&#x27;s capes and stand with their backs to the audience. A large-screen live-action projection is used to allow audiences to view the acts close-up. The installations are projected, 20 times life size, onto an upstage screen for audience viewing. The show also includes a brief instructional demonstration for audiences to replicate the contortions, as well as an audience participation segment.

==Productions==

=== Australian productions ===

The show debuted in 1998 at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival to sold-out audiences, where it won the &quot;Outright Best Show&quot; award. The success of the initial performance prompted an eight-month tour of Australia that covered 20,000 kilometres. The national tour was captured in the 2000 documentary &quot;Tackle Happy&quot;, directed by comedian Mick Molloy.

&quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; returned to tour Australia in March 2001, with a new cast consisting of Daniel Lewry, Steve Harrison and Jim MacGregor, under the management of Ross Mollison Productions. It ran from 30 March 2001 to 20 May 2001 at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne, hosted by the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. The tour continued in July at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Adelaide and in October at the Footbridge Theatre at the University of Sydney. In 2002 &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; performed at Riverside Theatre in Parramatta, the Playhouse Theatre in Canberra, the IMB Theatre in Wollongong, Tivoli Theatre in Bowen Hills, Brolga Theatre in Maryborough, Pilbeam Theatre in Rockhampton and Enmore Theatre in Sydney. The show appeared again at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in April 2002, with performers Brett Hartin and Richard Sutherland. In 2003 &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; was hosted in Armidale at the University of New England Arts Theatre and the Orange Civic Theatre in Orange before returning to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in March 2003, with a new Director&#x27;s Cut version of the production, featuring performers Brett Hartin and Aaron Bloomfield. The &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; Director&#x27;s Cut tour continued in Australia throughout 2003 and 2004, adding to the cast performer Barry Brisco from New York and featuring the return of Morley and Friend from their U.S. tour. The show briefly halted touring in Australia, temporarily reopening in April 2006 at the Canberra Theatre in Canberra and in March 2007 at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. The show continued to perform each year at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, hosted at the Athenaeum Theatre, produced by A-List Entertainment production company. In 2008 &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; premiered at the Adelaide Fringe Festival at the Royalty Theatre, which has hosted the show in subsequent years.

=== Overseas productions ===
In 2000, the creators performed the show at the Edinburgh International Fringe Festival, which was positively received by audiences. The show was then booked by a West End producer for a five-week run at London&#x27;s Whitehall Theatre, but numerous extensions led to the completion of a six-month tour in London&#x27;s West End. This was followed by performances in New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Norway, The Netherlands, Argentina, Switzerland and Iceland.

In 2001, Morley and Friend licensed the show to local production company Mollison Productions, which produced seven supporting companies and a troupe of actors to assist with international performance demands and tours. On 5 October 2001 &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; made its New York debut at the John Houseman Theatre on New York&#x27;s 42nd Street. The show was produced Thomas Milazzo and Ross Mollison of Mollison Productions. The original creators, Morley and Friend, starred in the production, which featured an opening stand-up comedy act by Wendy Vousden. The production ran successfully for over a year, closing on 3 November 2002.

In 2003, the duo licensed the show to Foster Entertainment in the U.S. &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot;, presented by David Foster of Foster Entertainment and Simon Morley, returned to New York&#x27;s 42nd Street on 4 August 2009 at the Bleecker Street Theatre. The cast consisted of Rich Binning, Chris Cannon, Christopher Goodwin and Gavin Stewart, with opening acts by Rachel Feinstein, Giulia Rozzi and Amy Schumer. The show, originally intending to end on 30 August, extended its Off-Broadway engagement and ran until 4 October 2009. Bleecker Street Theatre hosted a subsequent 8 week run of the show from 13 July 2010 to 4 September 2010.
The production has also established a flagship show in Las Vegas, which runs up to five nights a week at the Erotic Heritage Museum. At one stage, the &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; production managed eight franchises across the globe. The show has performed in a diverse range of venues during the course of its international tours. The UK tour included performances at the Grand Opera House in Belfast and the Arts Centre in New Milton. , the show had played in over 15 private venues in the U.S., with the country-run theatre in Rosslyn being the first public arts facility in the country to host the show. &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; has grossed over fifty million dollars, and performed in 35 countries in six different languages.

== Reception ==
&quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; has been noted for its controversial material amongst theatre critics and journalists. In a review of the production at the Whitehall Theatre in London, published in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Sarah Barrell said &quot;[the show] is certainly one of the more playfully subversive pieces of theatre to come within reach of the capital&#x27;s centres of power&quot;.

The show has received positive reviews from major international news outlets. Lyn Gardner of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the production a &quot;gently witty, surprisingly charming little show&quot;, and remarked that the material was handled with &quot;a high degree of decorum&quot;. British critic Jill Sharp called the show a &quot;theatrical extravaganza, celebrating with tongue-in-cheek innocence the flexibility of the phallus&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted the performers&#x27; &quot;irrepressible wit… [they] will leave you laughing ridiculously&quot;.

Other reviews were less favourable, criticising the show for its sexually graphic subject material. Conservative art critic Roger Kimball of the &quot;New Criterion&quot; magazine called the production as &quot;a juvenile example of the normalisation of deviance&quot;, likening it to toilet humour. Kimball said that the show was nothing more than a repulsive &quot;publicity stunt&quot;.

== Controversy ==

=== Production bans ===
Performance shows outside the pornography industry that feature genitalia risk breaching obscenity laws, even when legitimatised as genuine works of art. The &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; production employs practical measures, such as having performers stand with their backs to the audience, in order to avoid claims of public obscenity, and to enable the show to be performed in mainstream and civic theatres. In its production history, the show has faced bans from several international venues on the grounds of indecency.

==== New Zealand ====

In May 2002, &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; was banned from performing at the Royal Wanganui Opera House, New Zealand. The mayor, Chas Poynter, said &quot;the community is aghast and upset about this show&quot;. While the council was not able to prohibit performances of the show in other venues in the municipal, city authorities retained the power to ban the production at the civic opera house.

==== Queensland ====
In June 2002, the show was barred from being staged in civic theatres in the Cairns and Bundaberg Councils in Queensland. Despite reviewing the ban at the request of Executive Producer Thomas Milazzo, the councils ultimately refused to allow the show to use their facilities. In regard to the decision, Bundaberg mayor Kay McDuff said the show was not &quot;appropriate&quot; for the Bundaberg civic theatres.

==== United States ====
In October 2002, Friend and Morley appeared as guests on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; to promote their U.S. tour. The U.S. television network NBC permitted the broadcast despite protests from religious groups. Due to controversies surrounding the show, Salt Lake City&#x27;s NBC affiliate station, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, refused to broadcast the program.

In August 2004, during a U.S. tour of the production, Chicago Citizens for Community advocacy group filed a complaint, claiming that the show was &quot;illegal and subject to law enforcement&quot;. The Chicago Police ignored protests to ban the performance.

=== Legal disputes ===

==== Broadcast indecency ====

On 4 October 2002, Morley and Friend were interviewed on KRON-TV&#x27;s &quot;Morning News&quot; show to promote performances of &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; in San Francisco. The duo appeared dressed only in capes and during the course of the live broadcast, one of the performers briefly exposed his penis. The Enforcement Bureau of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) received a complaint from a viewer and launched an investigation into alleged television broadcast indecency. The FCC concluded that Young Broadcasting of San Francisco, KRON-TV&#x27;s proprietor, was liable for a fine of $27,000 for violating federal restrictions regarding the broadcast of indecent material. This was the maximum fine for a breach of this nature. The Commission rejected Young Broadcasting&#x27;s claims of bona-fide news coverage immunity, on the grounds that the puppetry &quot;display was not incidental to the coverage of a news event&quot;. The station issued a press release apologising for the incident and paid the fee.

An early 2002 appearance by the duo on the Canadian comedy game show &quot;Gutterball Alley&quot; was also the subject of a complaint to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council that year. The council concluded that the depictions of penises in the episode did not contravene its policies around nudity, as it was relevant and appropriate within the narrative context, but it found The Comedy Network culpable for not running a viewer advisory around the use of four-letter words in the dialogue.

==== Advertising standards ====
In February 2012, the Australian Advertising Standards Bureau received a complaint regarding a billboard advertising &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; at the Twelfth Night Theatre in Bowen Hills, Brisbane. While the ad featured no nudity, the complainant protested the &quot;thrusting of the male genital part into the public area&quot;. The ASB deemed the use of anatomical words acceptable in the context and the complaint was dismissed.

== Analysis ==
The use of comedy as a method of subverting or critiquing traditional assumptions and social dynamics has been commented on by several theorists. &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; uses theatrical and absurdist humour to deconstruct conventional representations of male genitalia. The show reduces the penis to a malleable object for the purposes of comedy, disassociating it from the taboo of sex and masculinity. Theatre critic Joe Adcock wrote in his review of the performance, &quot;The strictures of genteel decorum are violated. And so are the dogmas of smut.&quot;

Critics and academics note that &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; possesses a cultural value beyond its outwardly superficial subject matter. The show demystifies and demythologises the male sexual organ by displaying it with hyper-visibility and boldness. In her book, Maria San Filippo states that displaying the penis &quot;to spectacular effect ultimately renders it de-fetishized&quot;. She comments that in &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot;, the phallus is desexualised and separated from its traditional symbolic connotations, instead becoming purely a source of amusement.

Academic Elizabeth Stephens notes that &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; represents a change in the &quot;representability&quot; of the penis, with its contortions rendering the organ as &quot;humiliated, tortured or laughed at&quot;. She writes that while the penis is noticeably visible in the show, the phallus appears only in a distorted form, making it unrecognisable as a penis. According to Stephens, &quot;this freakshow spectacularization of the penis, in which it becomes visible only to be constituted as an object of ridicule or amusement… represents anxieties about the role of the penis in the construction of masculinity&quot;. Stephens states that &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; deconstructs traditional assumptions about the phallus and its symbolic attachment to masculinity.

Kovacs discusses the subversion of traditional phallic symbolism that &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; presents in its performances. She comments that conventional representations of the penis allude to power, dominance and violence, and states that the show &quot;challenges preconceived notions of the penis and its function as an object of sexuality and symbol of power&quot;. According to Kovacs, audiences are drawn to such productions as they challenge social norms and transfer taboo subjects from the private sphere &quot;and into the social realm through the agency of humour&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

=== Book adaptation ===
The creators published an instructional book, entitled &quot;Puppetry of the Penis: The Ancient Art of Genital Origami&quot;, in 2000. It features photographs, accompanied by illustrations and text, demonstrating how to replicate 26 of the installations.

=== Director&#x27;s cut ===
A Director&#x27;s Cut version of the show was introduced at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2003. It featured new performers Brett Hartin and Aaron Bloomfield, and showcased home videos from the United States tour of the production. Subsequent performances began with a multi-media presentation of the show&#x27;s development over the previous decade. They included video footage of original creators Morley and Friend on tour, performance highlights, and audience reactions.

=== Documentary ===
The initial Australian national tour of &quot;Puppetry of the Penis&quot; was the subject of the documentary &quot;Tackle Happy&quot;, directed and produced by Australian comedian Mick Molloy. The documentary focuses on the creators, Morley and Friend, and their production journey. It showcases the complications that the duo experienced during this time, including legal disputes, backstage tension and the difficulties of prolonged touring. The documentary is interspersed with dialogue from comedian Tony Martin and director Mick Molloy.

<doc id="726972" wikidata="Q454330" url="?curid=726972" title="Charles Frederick Worth">
<text>Charles Frederick Worth (13 October 1825 – 10 March 1895) was an English fashion designer who founded the House of Worth, one of the foremost fashion houses of the 19th and early 20th centuries. He is considered by many fashion historians to be the father of haute couture. Worth is also credited with revolutionising the business of fashion.

Established in Paris in 1858, his fashion salon soon attracted European royalty, and where they led monied society followed. An innovative designer, he adapted 19th-century dress to make it more suited to everyday life, with some changes said to be at the request of his most prestigious client Empress Eugénie. He was the first to replace the fashion dolls with live models in order to promote his garments to clients, and to sew branded labels into his clothing; almost all clients visited his salon for a consultation and fitting – thereby turning the House of Worth into a society meeting point. By the end of his career, his fashion house employed 1,200 people and its impact on fashion taste was far-reaching. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has said that his &quot;aggressive self-promotion&quot; earned him the title of the first couturier. Certainly, by 1870, his name was not just known in court circles, but appeared in women&#x27;s magazines that were read by wide society. He is credited with inventing the hoop skirt and the bustle.

Worth raised the status of dressmaking so that the designer-maker also became arbiter of what women should be wearing. Writing on the history of fashion and, in particular, dandyism, in 2002, George Walden said: &quot;Charles Frederick Worth dictated fashion in France a century and a half before Galliano&quot;.

==Early life==

Charles Frederick Worth was born on 13 October 1825 in the Lincolnshire market town of Bourne to William and Ann Worth. Some sources say he was their fifth and final child, and the only child other than his brother, William Worth III, to survive to maturity. Others say he was the family&#x27;s third child. Charles&#x27; father was a solicitor – described as &quot;dissolute&quot; – and left his family in 1836 after ruining its finances, leaving his mother impoverished and without financial support.

At the age of 11, Charles was sent to work in a printer&#x27;s shop. After a year, he moved to London to become an apprentice at the department store of Swan &amp; Edgar in Piccadilly. Seven years later, Lewis &amp; Allenby, another leading British textiles store, employed Worth.

===Early career===
In 1846, Charles Frederick Worth moved to Paris. He arrived there speaking no French and with £5 in his pocket. By the time his mother Ann Worth died in Highgate, London, in 1852, Worth was a sales assistant at Gagelin-Opigez &amp; Cie, a prestigious Parisian firm that sold silk fabrics to the court dressmakers, also supplying cashmere shawls (then a ubiquitous accessory) and ready-made mantles. It was here that he met Marie Vernet, who became his wife in 1851.

Worth began sewing dresses to complement the shawls at Gagelin. Initially, these were simple designs, but his expert tailoring caught the eye of the store&#x27;s clients. Eventually, Gagelin granted Worth permission to open a dress department, his first official entrance into the dressmaking world. A 1958 article in &quot;The Times&quot; published shortly before a centenary exhibition in London to mark the opening of his Paris fashion house noted that the ambitious Englishman&#x27;s ideas were almost too much for his employers: &quot;The young Worth, full of ideas, was having such a success at Gagelin&#x27;s that it was felt necessary to restrain his rashness&quot;. His obituary, written by a Paris correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; explained this comment in somewhat more detail, saying that he was refused a share in the Gagelin business, even though he had extended its activities into making up, rather than just selling, garments. He had also helped build the company&#x27;s international reputation by exhibiting prize-winning designs to both The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and the Exposition Universelle in Paris four years later. At the Paris exposition he had displayed a white silk court train embroidered in gold.
With a wife and two sons, Gaston Lucien (1853) and Jean Philippe (1856), Worth was eager to establish himself. By this stage, he was a known name. He acquired a young Swedish business partner, Otto Gustaf Bobergh, and in 1858 the duo set up in business at 7 rue de la Paix, naming the establishment Worth and Bobergh. Marie Vernet Worth played a key role from the start, both in the selling of the clothes and in introducing many new customers.

==House of Worth success==
Success came fast from this point on; in 1860 a ball dress Worth designed for Princess de Metternich was admired by Empress Eugénie, who asked for the dressmaker&#x27;s name and demanded to see him the next day. In her memoirs, de Metternich commented: &quot;And so...Worth was made and I was lost, for from that moment there were no more dresses at 300 francs each&quot;. Worth promptly replaced Madame Palmyre as the favorite designer and dressmaker of the Empress.

Worth offered a new approach to the creation of couture dresses, offering a plethora of fabrics (some from his former employer Gagelin) and expertise in tailoring. Within a decade, his designs were recognized internationally and in high demand. By the 1870s, they were appearing in fashion magazines read by wider society. Indeed, the influence of his designs may have spread even earlier via the fashion columns following Empress Eugénie&#x27;s fashion choices in influential titles such as US magazine &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot;.

Worth also changed the dynamic of the relationship between customer and clothes maker. Where previously the dressmaker (invariably female) would visit the client&#x27;s home for a one-to-one consultation, with the exception of Empress Eugénie clients generally attended Worth&#x27;s salon in rue de la Paix for a consultation and it also became a social meeting point for society figures. His approach to marketing was also innovative – he was the first to use live mannequins in order to promote his gowns to clients. His wife was his early model in the 1850s, leading Lucy Bannerman to describe Vernet as the world&#x27;s first professional model.

The fashion house had begun with 50 staff, but swelled over time to over 1,200 staff. This was work that required painstaking attention to detail, finesse and craftsmanship: a Worth bodice might have up to 17 pieces of material to ensure a good fit on its wearer. Seamstresses would be assigned to different workshops where they specialized in, for instance, making sleeves, stitching hems or skirt making. Most of the sewing of Worth garments was by hand, although the advent of the early sewing machine meant some main seams could be stitched mechanically.

===Clientele===

Worth became Empress Eugénie&#x27;s official dressmaker and ensured the majority of her orders for extravagant evening wear, court dresses, and masquerade costumes. She had him on call constantly to create dresses for events she attended. As an example of the scale of Worth&#x27;s business with the Empress, for the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, she had decided she needed 250 Worth dresses. Apart from Empress Eugénie, he had numerous other royal clients, including Empress Elisabeth of Austria.

Wealthy and socially ambitious women were drawn to Worth&#x27;s showpiece creations. Over time this included American clients; Worth loved working with them because his French language skills never reached fluency and, as he put it, American women: &quot;have faith, figures, and francs – faith to believe in me, figures that I can put into shape, francs to pay my bills&quot;. While some Americans bought Worth&#x27;s gowns in New York at the shop of Catherine Donovan on Madison Avenue, many wealthy Americans travelled to Paris to have their entire wardrobe made by Worth – and that meant morning, afternoon and evening dresses as well as what were termed &#x27;undress&#x27; items such as nightgowns and tea gowns. He would also design special occasion garments, such as wedding dresses. Alongside high society, the House of Worth also produced garments for popular stars such as Sarah Bernhardt, Lillie Langtry and Jenny Lind – who shopped there for both performance and private wear. Prices at Worth were dizzying for the time; the last bill it issued to Princess de Metternich – who had commented on the end of the 300 franc dress once Worth acquired royal patronage – was for the sum of 2,247 francs. Her purchase had been one lilac velvet dress.

===Worth&#x27;s appearance and manner===
The most famous surviving portrait of Charles Frederick Worth shows him wearing a hat, fur-trimmed cape and cravat. It appears that he had adopted this distinctive dress from the 1870s. A contemporaneous account from a visitor to the home of &quot;the Napoleon of costumiers&quot; in 1874 described Worth&#x27;s entrance to meet his party in: &quot;a flowing grey robe that fell to his heels, lined with pale yellow, with a deep vest to match, and numerous other overlapping appliances that modified and gave elegance to a costume as unique as it was comfortable&quot;. The visitor, who described Worth as &quot;not a bit &#x27;Frenchy&#x27;&quot;, also noted that he was of medium height, strongly but not stoutly built with a dark moustache and had the appearance of a man who lived temperately.

While the 1874 correspondent described Worth as &quot;not a man to be afraid of if one has a liberal exchequer&quot;, it was implied that the couturier was not afraid to dictate to clients what they should wear: &quot;Yet Mr Worth declares he has any amount of trouble with women – that they want to wear colours that don&#x27;t become them and a superabundance of trimming that is far from good taste&quot;. It appears Worth had the charm or gravitas to overcome his clients&#x27; requests for the wrong colour or trimming. His son Jean Philippe later recalled: &quot;His practised eye discerned the color and style of robe that would most completely enhance a woman&#x27;s charm, and with complete serenity she might leave the matter to him and give her mind to the contemplation of home affairs, her children and philanthropies&quot;.

==Fashion innovations==
Charles Frederick Worth&#x27;s dresses were known for their lavish fabrics and trimmings and for incorporating elements from period dress. He created unique pieces for his most important customers, but also prepared a variety of designs, showcased by live models, that could then be tailored to the client&#x27;s requirements in his workshop. Among his key innovations in women&#x27;s fashion were to the line of garments and their length.

===Garment shape===
At the height of his success, Worth reformed the highly popular trend, the crinoline. It had grown increasingly large in size, making it difficult for women to manage even the most basic activities, such as walking through doors, sitting, caring for their children, or holding hands. Worth wanted to design a more practical silhouette for women, so he made the crinoline more narrow and gravitated the largest part to the back, freeing up a woman&#x27;s front and sides. Worth&#x27;s new crinoline was a major success. Eventually, Worth abandoned the crinoline altogether, creating a straight gown shape without a defined waist that became known as the princess line.

===Shorter hemline===
Worth created a shorter hemline – a walking skirt – at the suggestion of Empress Eugénie, who enjoyed long walks but not long skirts. This was initially seen as too radical, even shocking, because it was at ankle length, but its practical benefits meant it was adopted over time. An 1885 example of the Worth &#x27;walking dress&#x27; is held at the archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
==Franco-Prussian War==
The Second Empire boomed, alongside Worth&#x27;s brand, until 1870, when the Prussians invaded France. Worth closed his business for a year; he was able to reopen a year later, but wartime meant he had difficulty finding clientele, staying in business with lines of new maternity, mourning, and sportswear. During the siege of Paris, he turned his salon into a military hospital. At this stage, the partnership with Bobergh was dissolved – with the Swede returning to his home country. In common with other fashion designers, the House of Worth was affected by the financial downturn of the 1880s. Worth found alternative sources of revenue in British and American customers and also turned his attention to encouraging the struggling French silk industry.

==Final years==
By the late 1880s, Worth had established characteristics of a modern couture house – twice annual seasonal collections and brand extensions through the franchising of patterns and fashion plates. One of his biographers notes that he had also successfully fostered the myth of the &quot;male &#x27;style dictator&#x27;&quot;.

Worth&#x27;s sons Gaston and Jean, who had joined the business in 1874 to help with management, finance, and design, became increasingly active, leaving Worth free to take more time off in his later years; by this stage he had a variety of health problems, including migraines. On 10 March 1895, Charles Frederick Worth died of pneumonia at the age of 69. He was celebrated enough to receive a variety of obituary notices. The notice in &quot;The Times&quot; said: &quot;It is not a little singular that Worth...should take the lead in what is supposed to be a peculiarly French art&quot;. &quot;Le Temps&quot;, meanwhile, suggested that Worth was of so artistic a temperament that he found England unsuited to his temperament and taste, and so gravitated to Paris, the city of light and beauty, to make his name. This was a claim disputed in British society magazine &quot;Queen&quot;, which put his rise to prosperity down to perseverance, intelligence and industry; this article was later reprinted in the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot;.

Although he was not in day-to-day control of House of Worth, he remained an active presence; his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; noted that he had turned over the business some years earlier but: &quot;he was to the last a constant frequenter of the establishment&quot;. At the time of his death, he had both a house in the Champs-Élysées and a villa in Suresnes near the Bois de Boulogne. He was described as a &quot;liberal contributor&quot; to French charities and a keen collector of &quot;artistic treasures and curiosities&quot;. There seems little doubt that Worth had amassed a fortune; an 1874 visitor to this villa (who called it a château) described an abundance of faience china; a conservatory full of exotic plants; a winter garden and stables full of immaculately turned out horses. The gardens contained statuary and stones retrieved from Tuileries Palace (former home of his foremost patron Empress Eugénie) that were about to be incorporated into a new hothouse.

Charles Frederick Worth&#x27;s funeral was held at the Protestant Church in the Avenue de la Grande Armée. He was buried in the grounds of his villa at Suresnes, according to the rites of the Church of England. Marie Vernet Worth died three years later.

==Legacy and achievements==
Although its founder was gone, the House of Worth was now an established entity; its most successful years were those around 1900. During this time, women were ordering 20–30 gowns at a time. By 1897, clients could order a garment by phone, by mail, or by visiting one of Worth&#x27;s branch stores in London, Cannes, or Biarritz. Worth displayed garments at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, as it had at earlier great exhibitions. The company&#x27;s annual turnover was placed at around five million francs at the turn of the century.

While Worth&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; described him as a &quot;dressmaker&quot;, he developed a framework for making and marketing clothes that shaped the &quot;haute couture&quot; industry that followed. A biography for Museum of the City of New York notes: &quot;Before Worth, the idea of a dress being recognizably the work of its creator didn&#x27;t exist&quot;. He regarded clothing as an art, and for the first time, designed clothing, not for a client&#x27;s taste, but based on his impression of what women should wear. He presented finished model designs to clients and dress buyers in similar fashion to the modern-day &quot;haute couture&quot; designer, also using live models. Worth was also the first designer to label his clothing, sewing his name into each garment he produced - the first distinct brand logo on clothing.

===Archives and commemoration===
The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has an archive of Charles Worth designs, including both sketches and garments. In 1956, the House of Worth (by then amalgamated with the fashion house of Paquin) donated 23,000 drawings of dresses to the museum. Two years later, the V&amp;A held a major retrospective to mark the centenary of the foundation of Charles Frederick Worth&#x27;s business.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art also holds an archive of his work, including several evening gowns.

A Charles Worth Gallery opened in his home town at Bourne, Lincolnshire, containing a display of documents, photographs and artefacts at the Heritage Centre run by the Bourne Civic Society.

<text>Syrup is a 1999 novel by Max Barry. Written under the pen name Maxx Barry, the novel satirizes American consumerism and corporate marketing strategies. It was adapted into the 2013 film &quot;Syrup&quot;.

==Plot==
Scat, a fresh marketing graduate, invents a new Coca-Cola product called &#x27;Fukk&#x27;. He tries to sell his idea to the company for $3 million, but discovers his former roommate and friend Sneaky Pete has already claimed the trademark. This leads Scat to move out of their shared apartment and stay with Cindy, his on-and-off girlfriend. She eventually kicks him out, and he ends up living with 6, a marketing executive, and Tina, her film student roommate. Scat leads the summer marketing campaign for Coca-Cola and makes it a success. He then attempts to sabotage Sneaky Pete&#x27;s secret project for Coca-Cola: the first ever feature-length advertising film.

==Coca-Cola BlāK==
In 2006, Coca-Cola introduced a coffee-flavored soft drink called Coca-Cola BlāK, first released in France in a black can. Barry commented on the similarities of this and his novel’s fictional Coca-Cola Fukk on his blog.

<doc id="726974" wikidata="Q3680987" url="?curid=726974" title="Closer to Heaven (musical)">
<text>Closer to Heaven is a musical by Jonathan Harvey and Pet Shop Boys. It was premiered in May 2001 at the Arts Theatre in London, opening to mixed reviews, and ran until 13 October 2001. A second production of &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; was premiered in Australia in 2005. New off-West End productions premiered in London in 2015, 2019 and 2024.

A spin-off cabaret show, entitled &quot;Musik: The Billie Trix Story&quot;, opened in Edinburgh in 2019.

== Plot ==
The story is narrated by retired rock icon and actress Billie Trix (Frances Barber), who otherwise has a fairly small part in the story. The opening number, &quot;My Night&quot;, is sung by Billie and the rest of the cast, and is used to introduce the characters.

Shell Christian (Stacey Roca), is going to see her estranged father, Vic Christian (David Burt), for the first time in years. Vic, who is gay, left Shell and her mother during her childhood, and now runs a successful gay club in London. Meanwhile, Straight Dave (Paul Keating), who has just arrived from Ireland, is working as a bartender at Vic&#x27;s club, although his ambition is to be a dancer at the club. After seeing and speaking to her father, Shell meets Dave, and they immediately fall in love.

Record producer Bob Saunders (Paul Broughton) is a friend of Billie Trix and a regular at Vic&#x27;s club. He sees Dave dancing and decides he wants to sign him for a boy band he is forming. He makes an offer to Dave, who has no interest in signing; however, Saunders continues to pressure Dave into working for him.

Dave meets and falls in love with drug dealer Mile End Lee (Tom Walker), who deals at Vic&#x27;s club. Shell is devastated when she discovers that Dave is gay, although part of her has suspected it all along. Meanwhile, Vic discovers Lee dealing drugs in his club and confiscates the drugs. Lee is worried he will be killed for losing the drugs.

At this point, everyone gets high on ketamine – Shell is still upset about Dave; Lee is worried about being killed; Dave is frustrated that Lee has withdrawn from him; and Billie, a habitual user, needs no excuse. Lee has a drug overdose and dies. At Lee&#x27;s funeral, Dave sings a song, &quot;For All of Us&quot;.

A few months later, Dave is apparently back on the road to success and sings &quot;Positive role model&quot; to end the show on a high (the 2015 and 2019 productions replaced &quot;Positive Role Model&quot; by &quot;Vocal&quot; as the closing song, and the 2024 production used &quot;For Every Moment&quot;).

== Music ==

Most of the songs that appeared in &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; were specifically written for the musical because Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe did not want to produce a &quot;jukebox musical&quot; in the vein of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; or &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. Several of the musical&#x27;s songs were pre-released on the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; 1999 album &quot;Nightlife&quot;, including &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot;, &quot;In Denial&quot;, and &quot;Vampires&quot;. &quot;Nightlife&quot; was recorded whilst they were writing &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; and originally more of the album&#x27;s tracks appeared in the musical. The oldest song is &quot;Shameless&quot;, which originally appeared as the B-side to &quot;Go West&quot; in 1993.

===Cast Album release===

An album, &quot;Closer to Heaven (Original Cast Recording)&quot;, was released in October 2001 and was produced by Pet Shop Boys and Stephen Hague. The album featured studio recorded version of songs from the musical.

It was planned to release &quot;Positive role model&quot;, as sung by Paul Keating, as a single before the album was released. Remixes by Almighty and Fergie were commissioned for use on the single, but plans were scrapped when the London production closed. These remixes remain unreleased, although the Almighty remix was available for a short time from the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; website and an edit of Fergie&#x27;s remix appeared on dance compilation &quot;Headliners:03&quot; in 2001. The full-length version of &quot;My Night&quot; was also available for a short time from the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; website.

A limited edition single of &quot;Run girl run&quot; by Billie Trix, a song based on the iconic Phan Thị Kim Phúc photograph from the Vietnam War, was available during later performances. The two track CD featured two versions of the track, of which brief snippets could be heard in &quot;K-Hole&quot;. The versions featured were: &quot;Run girl run (Original 1971 single version)&quot; and &quot;Run girl run (1981 post-apocalyptic nightmare mix&quot;. &quot;Run Girl Run&quot; later appeared in the spin-off cabaret musical &quot;Musik&quot; in 2019.

===Demo songs===
During the recording of the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; &quot;Nightlife&quot; album, there were many songs written for the musical that never made it to the final cut. Some of these songs have since been released as b-sides to Pet Shop Boys singles (for example the song &quot;Nightlife&quot; appeared as a b-side to &quot;Home and Dry&quot; in 2002) or been made available through the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; website, but many still remain unreleased. These songs include &quot;Tall Thin Men&quot;, &quot;The Night Is The Time To Explore Who You Are&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to start somewhere&quot; and &quot;Little Black Dress&quot;. The last of these, &quot;Little Black Dress&quot; has been covered by Pet Shop Boys covers band West End Girls and was released as a single in 2009.

== Other performances ==
The original run of &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; was from May 2001 to September 2001. This was extended to January 2002 because early performances were played to packed audiences. However, over the summer, audiences dwindled. In recent interviews, Neil Tennant has blamed this on poor marketing and bad press reviews. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, the Arts Theatre was worried about the continual fall of audience numbers across London and wanted a big audience puller, so &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; closed on 13 October 2001. It was replaced with &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

When &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; opened in London, the Pet Shop Boys said that there was interest from production companies all over the world, including New York and Germany.

On 8 May 2006, Frances Barber joined Pet Shop Boys to perform &quot;Friendly fire&quot; at a concert for BBC Radio 2. This was recorded and later released as the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; live album &quot;Concrete&quot;.

=== Brisbane 2005 ===
In 2005, a short series of performances was produced by the Brisbane Powerhouse in Brisbane, Australia. The cast for the Australian production included:

*Vic Christian – Chris Herden

In December 2005, Pet Shop Boys announced that this production would be moving to Sydney to coincide with the Sydney Mardi Gras; however, the production was cancelled due to time constraints.

The amateur City Theatre Company in Brighton staged &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; in September 2009 at the Sallis Benney Theatre. It had a five-day run, 22 to 26 September.

This smaller scale production featured the 2012 song &quot;Vocal&quot; as the closing number instead of original closing numbers of &quot;Positive Role Model&quot; and the reprise of &quot;My Night&quot;.

This production featured a more immersive experience with the theatre transformed into a club setting with cabaret tables, and again replaces the final song, dropping both &quot;Positive Role Model&quot; and &quot;Vocal&quot; and instead adding &quot;For Every Moment&quot;, from the 2019 spin off show &quot;Musik&quot;.

==&quot;Musik: The Billie Trix Story&quot;==
In April 2019 it was announced that a spin-off cabaret show entitled &quot;Musik&quot;, written by Jonathan Harvey with four brand new songs written and produced by Pet Shop Boys, would premiere at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2019. This new one-woman show produced by Cahoots Theatre Company explores the backstory of Billie Trix and stars Frances Barber who originated the role in the original London run of &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot;.

On 6 August 2019, an EP of the six songs from &quot;Musik&quot; was released to streaming services.

A London run of &quot;Musik&quot; ran from 5th February to 1st March 2020 at Leicester Square Theatre.

<text>Eon Productions Limited is a British film production company that primarily produces the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series. The company is based in London&#x27;s Piccadilly and also operates from Pinewood Studios in the UK.

==&quot;James Bond&quot; films==

Eon was started by film producers Albert R. &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli and Harry Saltzman in July 1961, at the same time they became partners and sought financing for &quot;Dr. No&quot;. The year before they formed Danjaq, which for legal reasons became Eon&#x27;s holding company, from which it licenses the rights to produce the &quot;Bond&quot; films.

Broccoli had been interested in the &quot;Bond&quot; novel rights for several years but was dissuaded from pursuing the project by his former partner. When they dissolved their relationship he was free to pursue the property, for which Saltzman, a novice to film production, had taken a gamble to acquire. The two were introduced by a New York writer who was acquainted with both, and formed a partnership within a week of meeting. The enterprise was and is still a family business, including both wives of the principal partners, as well as several of their progeny, the latter group now carrying on their parents&#x27; work. Albert almost immediately included Dana Broccoli&#x27;s college-aged son Michael G. Wilson in the early films, doing various production jobs.

In 1975, after nine films, Harry Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists. Although Albert R. Broccoli died in 1996, Eon Productions is still owned by the Broccoli family, specifically Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s daughter, Barbara Broccoli, and his stepson and her half-brother by actress Dana Wilson Broccoli, Michael G. Wilson, who are the current producers of the films.

In February 2025, Amazon MGM Studios and Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced the formation of a joint venture that would manage the franchise rights to James Bond, giving Amazon MGM full creative control from the Broccoli family.

Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s name has appeared in the opening &quot;presents&quot; credit of every Eon-produced &quot;James Bond&quot; film, and as the first name in the credits from &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; onwards. From &quot;Dr. No&quot; through &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, the credit was &quot;Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli present&quot;; for some films Broccoli came first. After Saltzman left, the opening credit was &quot;Albert R. Broccoli presents&quot; through to &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, which was the last film produced before Broccoli&#x27;s death, even after Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson replaced him as producers. On all films since Broccoli&#x27;s death, the opening credit is &quot;Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s Eon Productions presents&quot;, with &quot;Ltd.&quot; usually added after &quot;Productions&quot; in the film proper.

The 1965 film &quot;Thunderball&quot; differs from the others in how it credits Saltzman and Broccoli; due to a legal agreement with Kevin McClory related to the rights to Ian Fleming&#x27;s original novel, McClory received producer credit on the film, with Saltzman and Broccoli credited as executive producers. This agreement also gave McClory the rights to remake &quot;Thunderball&quot; in the future, resulting in the 1983 non-Eon production, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. McClory would attempt to remake the story a second time in the 1990s, but was prevented from doing so. In 1999, Eon picked up the rights to the &quot;Casino Royale&quot; novel after a lawsuit between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and Sony Pictures ended as part of a trade deal that saw Sony acquiring MGM&#x27;s interest in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film rights.

The copyrights and trademarks for the film properties which began with &quot;Dr. No&quot;, are held by Danjaq and United Artists Corporation; United Artists was bought by MGM in 1981, but as an MGM subsidiary its name still appears in Bond copyright and trademark disclaimers. &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006), &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008), &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012) and &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015) were co-distributed with Sony Pictures Releasing through its Columbia Pictures label. With the revival of United Artists – formed as a joint venture between MGM and Annapurna Pictures under the label United Artists Releasing – as well as the expiration of Columbia Pictures&#x27; deal with the Bond franchise, the distribution of &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021) is shared between United Artists Releasing (domestically) and Universal Pictures (internationally), while Danjaq retains the essential rights to the film.

The distribution rights for all of Eon&#x27;s films are owned by MGM Home Entertainment, and were controlled by MGM&#x27;s distributor Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (previously 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment). Sony Pictures Home Entertainment initially assumed the home video rights to &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, but the 2012 home video editions of this film were issued by MGM and 20th Century Fox. Since 2020, WBHE took over the home entertainment distribution rights to the Bond films after MGM ended their home media agreement with Fox in June 2020, excluding the home media release of &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (which is handled by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, although both companies own a joint venture called Studio Distribution Services).

The &quot;Bond&quot; films produced by Eon Productions are:
# &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962)
# &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963)
# &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964)

# &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971)
# &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973)
# &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974)
# &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977)

# &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008)
# &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012)
# &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015)
# &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021)

Other production companies were responsible for the &quot;Bond&quot; productions &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1954), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967) and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983); the first is a one-hour TV film produced for an anthology series and the others are feature films produced for the cinema. &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is a remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot;.

==Other film productions==
Since its first film, &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962, Eon has made eight non-&quot;Bond&quot; films. Saltzman and Broccoli produced other films separately: Broccoli produced the film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, based on a book by Ian Fleming; Saltzman produced several non-&quot;Bond&quot; films during this time including &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; and &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;.

Other non-&quot;Bond&quot; projects from either 1963 or 1964 – &quot;The Marriage Game&quot; written by Terry Southern and to have been directed by Peter Yates and &quot;The Pass Beyond Kashmir&quot; based on the novel by Berkely Mather – did not go into production.

In 2008, Eon signed a deal with Columbia Pictures to develop fifteen thrillers and family films outside the &quot;Bond&quot; franchise, with budgets of up to $80 million (£40 million). The company hopes the move will allow more British writers to establish themselves in the United States.

Eon Productions produced the adaptation of Mark Burnell&#x27;s first book in the &quot;Stephanie Patrick&quot; series, titled &quot;The Rhythm Section&quot;. Starring Blake Lively and directed by Reed Morano, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was released on 31 January 2020.

The non-Bond films produced by Eon Productions are:
# &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot; (1963)
# &quot;The Silent Storm&quot; (2014)
# &quot;Radiator&quot; (2014)
# &quot;Film Stars Don&#x27;t Die in Liverpool&quot; (2017)
# &quot;Nancy&quot; (2018)

# &quot;Ear for Eye&quot; (2021)
# &quot;Till&quot; (2022)
# Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (TBA) In Development
# The Fighter (TBA) In Development

<text>The Federation of South Arabia (FSA; &quot;&quot;) was a federal state under British protection in what would become South Yemen. Its capital was Aden.

== History ==
Originally formed on April 4, 1962 from 15 states of the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South. On January 18, 1963, the Royal Colony of Aden joined it. After the annexation of the Upper Aulaki Sultanate in June 1964, the federation included 17 states.
On July 23, 1962, negotiations began in London between the British Minister of Colonies, Duncan Sandys, and the ministers of the Federation of South Arabia and the Colony of Aden. The parties raised the issue of the constitutional status of Aden and the conditions for its entry into the federation. Numerous parties and organizations in Aden protested against these negotiations, declaring that the colonial ministers did not have the right to decide the fate of the population of Aden and that only the national government of Aden, created by general elections, would be competent to decide the question of a union with the federation. To achieve all this, it was necessary to eliminate its dependence on Britain. Representatives of the opposition, led by the Aden Trade Union Congress, said that any union concluded against the will of the people of Aden would be dissolved at the first opportunity. On the day the London negotiations began, a protest strike was declared in Aden. The Aden Trade Union Congress called for this strike, despite the fact that Aden had had a law prohibiting strikes since 1960, and violators were subject to imprisonment.

On August 16, 1962, negotiations ended with the signing of an agreement, according to which Aden, while remaining under British sovereignty, was to become part of the Federation of South Arabia on March 1, 1963. The agreement provided that the federation agreement, signed on February 11, 1959, will remain in force, and the new agreement will be only an addition to it. During these negotiations, agreement was also reached to introduce minor changes to the constitutional status of Aden once it became part of the federation.

In 1965, the British temporarily removed the government of the Federation of South Arabia and imposed direct colonial rule.

In 1966, the Federation team took part in the Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. The Federation was dissolved following independence along with the Protectorate of South Arabia and the formation of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen on November 30, 1967.

* Abdul-Qawi Hassan Makkawi (7 March 1965 – 25 September 1965)

* Sir Richard Turnbull (21 December 1964 – 22 May 1967)
* Sir Humphrey Trevelyan (22 May 1967 – 30 November 1967)

==Postage stamps==
The Federation issued its own Adeni postage stamps from 1963 to 1966. Most of its issues were part of the omnibus issues common to all the Commonwealth territories, but it did issue its own definitive stamps on 1 April 1965. The set of 14 included 10 values, from 5 to 75 fils, each depicting the arms of the Federation in a single color, while the top four values (100 fils, 250 fils, 500 fils, and 1 dinar), featured the flag of the Federation.

The stamps referred to above are those listed in the Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalog. A number of other stamps have also been issued and are listed in Stanley Gibbons and other widely used stamp catalogs. It is possible, or even likely, that some of the stamps of South Arabia were not issued primarily for postal use.

<text>Alternative is a compilation album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys. It was released on 7 August 1995 by Parlophone.

&quot;Alternative&quot; is a two-disc set, consisting of 30 B-sides in chronological order. The title &quot;Alternative&quot; was a last-minute change from the title that had been long saved for such an album, &quot;Besides&quot;, but that title was taken by American rock band Sugar, who released their own B-sides compilation two months prior.

A remake of the original 7-inch &quot;Paninaro&quot;, titled &quot;Paninaro &#x27;95&quot;, was released as a single (which was included on the later &quot;&quot; set) to promote the two-disc compilation which reached number two in the UK Albums Chart.

The cover of &quot;Alternative&quot; features photographs of Tennant and Lowe in fencing masks. The first copies of the CD have a lenticular image on the cover which shifts between the two photographs.

Neil Tennant revealed in a radio interview with Absolute Radio that a second B-side album may be released in 2010. On 11 November 2011, the duo announced through Varsity that they would release another B-sides album in February 2012, titled &quot;Format&quot;.

<text>Chuwit Kamolvisit (; ; born 29 August 1961) is a controversial Thai politician who was once the country&#x27;s biggest massage parlour owner, known as the &quot;tub tycoon&quot;. After an arrest in 2003, he publicly claimed that he paid large bribes to many Thai police officers. He then sold some of his massage parlors, formed his own political party and unsuccessfully ran for Bangkok governor in August 2004. In 2005 he was elected for a four-year term to the Thai House of Representatives, but in 2006 the Constitutional Court removed him from parliament. In October 2008 he again ran for governor of Bangkok as an independent but was not elected. In the July 2011 general election his party won four seats in the House of Representatives. He used the pseudonym Davis Kamol on occasion.

==Early life and education==
Born on 29 August 1961 in British Hong Kong to a Hong Kong-born, Thai Chinese father and a Thai mother. Chuwit grew up in a building (now Kiatnakin Phatra Bank, Yaowarat) along Yaowarat Road, or better known as Bangkok&#x27;s Chinatown. His father was engaged in a clothing business and as a manufacturer of Thai jeans brand Hara including being the founder of the Cathay Department Store (now Tesco Lotus, Yaowarat).

He graduated from the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy at Thammasat University, and then earned a Master of Business Administration degree at University of San Diego in San Diego, California, United States. Later, he also earned a Masters of Political Science (Politics and Governments) at Thammasat University.

== Business and allegations ==

Chuwit controls the Davis Group, a business that consists of six Bangkok massage parlours near Ratchadaphisek Road, which employ around 600 women each: Copacabana, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Honolulu, Hi Class, Emmanuelle, and Julianna. The massage parlours cater mainly to wealthy Thais and operate within a &quot;grey area&quot; of the law: massage parlors are legal, but prostitution is not. Prices are from 3,000 to 6,000 baht for a two-hour session. The Davis Group&#x27;s holdings also include the Davis Bangkok Hotel, Thai villas and a shopping mall on Sukhumvit Road Soi 24., which is one of the most expensive areas in Bangkok.

===&quot;Sukhumvit Square&quot; incident===
In January 2003, Chuwit was accused of hiring around 600 men to raze several bars, shops, a laundry and a travel agency on &quot;Sukhumvit Square&quot;, a plot of land he owns on Sukhumvit Soi 10. This was an apparent attempt to remove the low-rent tenants so that the land could be developed. The tenants believed they had valid leases from another company and were not notified of the raid, which took place early on a Sunday morning. Chuwit was arrested and spent a month in prison. He denied responsibility and was finally released on bail.

The police, whom he says he had bribed an average US$160,000 a month over 10 years, refused to protect him, so he went public, releasing the names of the top officers, the sums they were paid, and their frequent visits to his six massage parlors. He also claimed that &quot;VIP&quot; policemen received free service in his parlours, an allegation that was later confirmed in interviews with some of the masseuses. Following an investigation, several prominent policemen were suspended or demoted. Chuwit also accused his prison wardens of corruption, as they accepted bribes from him.

Shortly after his corruption revelations, Chuwit disappeared for two days. He later claimed he was abducted and abused by police; however, others believe he had staged his own disappearance. Chuwit&#x27;s massage parlours were then raided and some of his bank accounts were frozen. He was also charged with procuring minors for prostitution because three masseuses under the age of 18 were found working in one of his parlours. He was acquitted in June 2004, as the court found the girls had used forged ID cards and Chuwit was not held responsible. During the same month, Chuwit sold three of his parlours, saying that police harassment had made operations difficult for him.

In a February 2004 interview, Chuwit claimed that he had paid Thai policemen to clear his Sukhumvit Soi 10 property. When the issue became public, the police allegedly demanded more money, which he refused to pay. They turned against him, and he revealed his bribe payments as a response.

In July 2006, after a three-year trial, Chuwit and 130 associates were acquitted of the razing charges; however, a corporate lawyer was sentenced to eight months in prison for paying army engineers to destroy the businesses. Chuwit converted the area on Sukhumvit Soi 10 into a public park named &quot;Chuvit Garden&quot; for about 100 million baht.

Chuvit Garden covers a total area of 7 rai or 2.7 acres, it is the last large empty parcel of land in the Sukhumvit area. In 2018, the land alone is estimated to be worth more than US$228 million or 7.2 billion Thai Baht

==Political career==

In September 2003, Chuwit formed his own political party, called &quot;First Thai Nation&quot;. In April 2004 he announced that he was running for governor of Bangkok. He planned to spend about 20 million baht on his campaign, with corruption in the police and government as his main campaign topic. The Bangkok governor elections were held on 29 August 2004, Chuwit&#x27;s 43rd birthday. He placed third, with some 300,000 votes, or about 16 percent of the vote. However in the 2005 legislative elections, Chuwit merged his party with the conservative Chart Thai Party. He ran successfully as a party list candidate, becoming a member of parliament. In May 2005 he began hosting a weekly call-in radio show, during which he listened to complaints from the public. In January 2006, however, the Constitutional Court revoked his MP status. A candidate must be a member of a political party for at least 90 days before the general election and the court found that Chuwit had not joined Chart Thai in time.

During the 2008 Bangkok gubernatorial election, he again declared his candidacy for governor of Bangkok. As was the case in 2004, he placed third, gaining 14% of the vote. He admitted that his campaign may have suffered when he punched a reporter in the face for allegedly describing Chuwit as &quot;unmanly&quot;. In May 2011 Chuwit formed a new political party, &quot;Love Thailand&quot; (Rak Prathetthai). In the 2011 Thai general election, the party won four seats in the House of Representatives. He had campaigned as a protest candidate and anti-corruption watchdog. In September 2012, the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; published an audio recording of a lecture given by Chuwit at Hatyai University in southern Thailand. Chuwit spoke to the students about how Thai police make money from the sex industry, and the &quot;Post&quot; noted that the topic is &quot;a subject not normally taught in university courses.&quot;

Chuwit has been critical of Prayut Chan-o-cha&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic since the outbreak of a third wave in April 2021, which originated from the nightlife area, Thong Lor. He also criticised the government of failing to buy enough vaccines. His criticism would later cause Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana to show a better understanding of the situation.

== Vigilante career ==
Since 2022, Chuwit became a vigilante against corruption in Thai society. On 9 February 2023, Chuwit accused Police Lieutenant colonel Wasawat Mukkarasakul of corruption on Facebook. He accused Wasawat of running Thailand&#x27;s largest online gambling ring, where he accepted bribes worth tens of thousands of bahts. He also accused Wasawat of laundering money whilst he was the director of ten companies. The following day, Wasawat was suspended from his duty.

==Personal life==
Chuwit was previously married to Kate Johnson, but later divorced her. He then remarried Ngamta Sukniran, with whom he has four children together. His daughter, Trakarnta (Thaia) Kamolvisit studied at Millfield School, United Kingdom; and graduated with a degree in economics from University of San Francisco. 

In 2023, he revealed that he had terminal liver cancer and had traveled to England for treatment.

<doc id="726999" wikidata="Q317752" url="?curid=726999" title="Abdullah al-Sallal">
<text>Abdullah Yahya al-Sallal (; 9 January 1917 – 5 March 1994) was a Yemeni military officer who was the leader of the North Yemeni Revolution of 1962 and served as the first President of the Yemen Arab Republic from 27 September 1962 until his removal on 5 November 1967. It was his government that abolished slavery in Yemen.

==Early life==
Al-Sallal was born in the village of Sha&#x27;asan, Sanhan district, in Sanaa Governorate. His father died when he was young. Al-Sallal was sent to the only orphanage in Sanaa, known as the Orphan School, which later became famous for raising many of Yemen&#x27;s greatest patriots and some of the most influential politicians of that era.

In the late 1930s, he completed his military education in Baghdad, Iraq. He became a second lieutenant at this time.

Though not a member of the social elite in Yemen, Al-Sallal was widely respected by the military community as a competent and brazen officer despite being the son of a butcher, a profession looked down upon prior to the revolution.

==Political career==

Al-Sallal led the revolutionary forces that deposed King Muhammad al-Badr and brought the Kingdom of Yemen to an end. He presided over the newly founded Yemen Arab Republic (YAR), with close ties to Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt which served as the Yemen Arab Republic&#x27;s strongest ally in the war against the Saudi Arabian-backed royalists that lasted into 1970. 

Yemen&#x27;s President Abdullah al-Sallal negotiated with tribal leaders after the revolution to help cement the republic. He was later ousted in a bloodless coup led by Abdul Rahman Al-Iryani and exiled to Egypt, where he remained until President Ali Abdullah Saleh invited him to return in the early 1980s. 

Six different men held the position of Prime Minister under Al-Sallal, including Al-Sallal himself three times. He held both titles from the formation of the republic until 26 April 1963, when he appointed Abdul Latif Dayfallah, as well as briefly in 1965 and from 18 September 1966 until the end of his presidency. At the time, he participated in the 2nd Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Cairo in 1964. Abdul Rahman al-Eryani, al-Sallal&#x27;s successor to the presidency in 1967, served as Prime Minister in 1963 and 1964. Hassan al-Amri held the post three times.

<doc id="727002" wikidata="Q844472" url="?curid=727002" title="Pen spinning">
<text>Pen spinning is a form of object manipulation that involves the deft manipulation of a writing instrument with hands. Although it is often considered a form of self-entertainment (usually in a school or office setting), multinational competitions and meetings are sometimes held. It is sometimes classified as a form of contact juggling; however, some tricks, e.g. &quot;spreads&quot; and &quot;aerial tricks&quot; do leave contact with the body. In addition to writing instruments, it is often also seen performed by drummers with their drumsticks. Pen spinning has quickly gained international popularity through online video sharing and forums. The hobby has been popular around the world since at least the 1970s.

==History==
The earliest record of pen spinning comes from a student in pre-WWII Japan. Others in Japan spun pens at least as early as the 1970s; however, the tricks performed were only basic ones, such as the ThumbAround and Sonic. Hideaki Kondoh is considered the first pen spinning pioneer in Japan and is recognized with creating the first pen spinning website, released on December 1, 1997. Kondoh began pen spinning in the 1980s, and by 1998, he compiled and could perform 24 tricks, many of which he developed after learning techniques from other people.

In the United States, Fernando Kuo, better known by his online alias &quot;Kam&quot;, was inspired by Kondoh&#x27;s website to advance pen spinning and broaden its audience. Kam, who started spinning in 1993, created the website Pentix in January 2000 in an attempt to create an easily accessible database and message board for pen spinning information and communication. As the popularity of the website and its forum grew and their limits became apparent, Kam closed Pentix and redistributed its information to a sequel website (which would also close) and to a new forum titled the Universal Pen Spinning Board, opened on January 19, 2004. The Universal Pen Spinning Board was an English-speaking board created with the goal to be the first forum in which pen spinners from any website or location around the world could communicate, and would later close during October 2018. PenDolSa, an unrelated Korean pen spinning board released in 2003, was the first large-scale pen spinning forum.

The number and variations of tricks has since grown into at least the hundreds, with newer tricks such as the Shadow, Palm Spin, and Bust. Since the early 2000s, video hosting websites, such as YouTube, and a growing number of other Internet forums from various countries have been used to share videos and to centralize the community, which has contributed to a rise in popularity of pen spinning. In 2007, the World Tournament acted as the first global pen spinning competition, and pen spinners from communities centered around the world could join.

==Community==

The pen spinning community is present mostly on the Internet through forums, video hosting platforms, and chat services such as Discord. Forums are often centered in specific countries, such as Japan, France, Germany, India and China. Forums may also be international, as is the case with the Universal Pen Spinning Board and Reddit-based communities. Over time, users may migrate to a similar or upgraded forum, causing some forums to become inactive. While forums are operated largely as separate entities, cross-communication occasionally occurs for international events. Pen tricks are also quite common among a subset of the Yeshiva world, having become a common habit by those midst of their learning. It has also become something of a status symbol in said communities.

===Competitions===
Tournaments are organized online and live tournaments are occasionally held in China, Japan, and Korea. The biggest competitions held are the World Tournament and World Cup, each usually held on alternating years since the first World Tournament in 2007. Both are held in a single-elimination format, but the World Tournament consists of single-person participants, and the World Cup consists of teams made of multiple spinners representing their board. As in international competitions, anyone associated with a board can request to join, and spots are usually given to the pen spinners deemed most skillful, often by qualifying videos or as a benefit from winning a previous competition. Judging systems for the competitions have not been completely standardized, and bias is often present among the judges. Due to pen spinning being considered a highly subjective activity to judge, scores and comments concerning a single video can vary greatly.

Aside from large tournaments, small competitions also occur. These so-called “battles” involve at least two pen spinners submitting a video of themselves spinning, and the community decides who the winner of the battle is by collectively judging and voting on who demonstrated superior spinning.

==Finger slots, notations, and breakdowns==
Spinners use a variety of systems, symbols, and abbreviations to help them express how the pen is spun.

===Finger slots===

For convenience, pen spinners have adopted a common numbering to represent the fingers and the spaces between them, called finger slots. The fingers are numbered sequentially from &quot;1&quot; for the index finger, to &quot;4&quot; for the little finger, to the letter &quot;T&quot; for the thumb. Finger slots are represented by placing any two or more of these together. For example, the space between the index and middle fingers is called &quot;12&quot;. A pen held between the thumb and ring finger is in slot &quot;T3&quot;. Symbols and slots can be expanded to include other parts of the hand, body, and surrounding atmosphere. The webbing at the base of the thumb and index finger is called &quot;TF&quot;, for thumb flap, and the palm is usually notated as &quot;P&quot;. The &quot;*&quot; symbol is sometimes used to refer to the absence of a second body part or object holding the pen (e.g., a pen resting on the surface of the palm is in slot P*, or, more literally, PAir). Other slot systems have been invented in order to describe complicated positions, but these are usually only used when necessary to avoid ambiguity.

===Notations===
A notation system often consists of a combination of names for tricks, their direction, and the slot system in order to convey in what way a pen was spun. Notation systems range from formal with high detail to informal with almost no detail. More complicated ways of spinning, such as using one pen with two hands (called &quot;1p2h&quot;), have amplified the ambiguity of some notation systems and have generated the need for using more descriptive and technical systems. The following system is often used for its relative simplicity and effectiveness in describing the tricks used.
*Modifier: A modifier adds aspects not done by default to the base trick. Modifiers may not need to be added depending on what trick is performed and are often abbreviated (e.g., Fingerless to FL, which means the initial push for the trick comes from the movement of the whole hand or wrist, rather than a singular finger).
*Trick name: This is the base trick. While the trick name may not be omitted, it can be abbreviated for certain tricks (e.g., ThumbAround to TA).
*Direction: This is the direction of rotation of the pen during a trick. If the direction is omitted, it is assumed to be the &quot;Normal&quot;. If the direction is &quot;Reverse&quot;, it can be shortened to &quot;Rev&quot;. Outside of notations, the direction is often omitted to refer to an entire family of tricks, and the omission does not automatically imply Normal.
*Number of revolutions: This is the total amount of revolutions of the pen throughout the entire trick, written in decimal form. If omitted, it is assumed to be the default amount for the individual trick stated. Some tricks can only have a certain number of revolutions.
*Starting position: This is the finger slot, or other position on the hand/body, of the pen when the trick starts. If omitted, it is assumed to be the default position for the individual trick.
*Ending position: This is the finger slot, or other position on the hand/body, of the pen when the trick ends. If omitted, it is assumed to be the default position for the individual trick. When notating a trick, a &quot;-&quot; is placed between the starting and ending positions.

For example, a ThumbAround executed fingerless in the forward direction with the pen starting and ending in the thump flap slot would be fully notated as &quot;Fingerless ThumbAround Normal 1.0 TF-TF&quot; or, with some information abbreviated or omitted, &quot;FL TA TF-TF&quot;.

===Breakdowns===
Breakdowns are annotations of hybrids (a mix of a few &quot;interrupted&quot; tricks) and combos (combinations of tricks) which are used to define how a hybrid or combo is performed. The simplest breakdowns often only have a &quot;&gt;&quot; between tricks to show that they are connected. Using this system, a Pass from slot 12 to 23 connected to another Pass from slot 23 to 34 would be notated as &quot;Pass Normal 12-23 &gt; Pass Normal 23-34&quot;. More formal breakdowns use other symbols to show different aspects of the connections between tricks, such as describing which trick was interrupted. No one format is used every time, and formats are often deviated from when certain pen spinners write out breakdowns.

==Fundamental tricks==
In pen spinning there are four main fundamental tricks spinners often learn first. The fundamentals do not represent all fields in pen spinning nor are they the smallest individual pen movements possible, but they are recognized as providing useful foundations for basic technique and concepts.

===ThumbAround Normal===

A ThumbAround is performed by pushing a pen using any finger (usually the middle finger if done in isolation) except the thumb to initiate the pen to spin around the thumb one time, then catching it between the thumb and a finger. Before the pen spinning community became significantly organized, the ThumbAround Normal was known by a multitude of names, including 360 Degree Normal, Forward, Normal, and Thumb Spin (now the name of a separate trick).

===Sonic Normal===

The primary goal of a Sonic is to transfer the pen from one finger slot to another quickly. In the Sonic Normal, a pen is held in a finger slot not involving the thumb and is spun in a conic-like motion behind a finger (or fingers) to another finger slot further up the hand, making a single revolution. Hideaki Kondoh is generally accredited with giving the Sonic its name, which he did because of the rapid speed at which the pen would move compared to the ThumbAround.

===Charge Normal===

A Charge does not involve spinning the pen over any fingers or any body parts rather, the pen is spun conically in a single finger slot. When viewing the palm-side of the hand during the Charge Normal, the pen spins clockwise in the right hand and counterclockwise in the left hand. The Charge forms the basis for all tricks that rely on conical movement, including the Sonic. This trick is often performed by drummers using drumsticks rather than pens.

===FingerPass Normal===

A single Pass involves rotating a pen 0.5 times from one finger slot to another. When performing the Pass Normal on the palm-side of hand, the pen goes downward. When performing a Pass Normal on the other side of the hand, the pen goes upward. A small combination of Passes involving the pen rotating fully around the hand, starting and ending in the 12 slot, is called a FingerPass, with the FingerPass Normal being constructed out of Pass Normals. This short combo is consistently considered the hardest fundamental to master because Passes between the little finger and the ring finger are often difficult to make smooth. A Pass combo similar to a FingerPass was performed by the character Boris Grishenko in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, using only three fingers instead of the usual four.

==Advanced tricks==
In addition to the four fundamentals, more tricks have been invented and used successfully in combos. All tricks other than the fundamentals are usually grouped under the term &quot;advanced tricks&quot; (this is somewhat a misnomer due to many spinners considering many of these tricks rather simple.) Most advanced tricks are hybrids, which is a pen movement that consists of at least two tricks, and one or more of the tricks is &quot;interrupted&quot;, that is, not completed fully before the next trick is executed. A more complex hybrid can also involve another hybrid within itself. Over time, individual names for hybrids have become increasingly uncommon because, instead of a unique name for each new hybrid, breakdowns explaining the interrupted tricks performed are now used. The following are common trick groups, the first three of which are often considered low-difficulty. 

===Spins===
A Spin refers to the motion of a pen circularly spinning while it is in contact with the hand or other body part. Spins done on the knuckle-side of the fingers are called &quot;Top Spins&quot;. There are many versions of the Spin, and the names usually involve the body parts the pen spins on (e.g., in the Thumb Spin, the pen spins on top of the thumb). Spins are mostly performed as a part of a larger trick, such as a Shadow, which consists of Charges and a Top Spin.

Wipers are a group of Spin tricks that are usually categorized separately from other Spins due to the unique way the pen is held. In the Wiper Normal, the pen, held from one of its ends pointing downward, rotates 180 degrees upward in the shape of an arc. Wipers are considered to be some of the simplest tricks because they consist of this single movement. Because of the unusual way the pen is held, Wipers are often used to diversify the appearance of the pen movement in a combo. Combos in which the pen is always held from one of its ends are sometimes known as &quot;Wiper combos&quot;. Wipers, in conjunction with Passes, form the Infinity trick category, which is characterized by pen motions that follow a path similar to a figure-eight or infinity symbol.

===Arounds===
An Around is a trick in which the pen rotates around one or more body parts and is named after the body part(s) the pen rotates around. For example, in a Middle Index Around, the pen goes around the middle and index fingers. The ThumbAround, as a fundamental, is usually the first Around a pen spinner learns.

When an Around Reverse is executed fingerless with a turn of the hand or wrist, it is known as a BackAround, or simply &quot;Bak&quot;. Baks, while technically a type of Around, is often discussed as a separate family of tricks than other Arounds. A type of Bak Reverse executed with an upward bump motion of the finger adjacent to the finger(s) the pen spins around is known as a Bust. Baks were invented by David Weis, an American spinner, in order to create a combination of tricks in which the pen would follow a smooth continuous motion without explicit finger pushes, and they have since become a widely used trick today.

===Sonic variations===
Sonic variations are different ways of transferring the pen from one slot to another, the main goal of the basic Sonic. The Sonic family is different from other trick groups in that the defining characteristic of tricks in the family is that they simply have &quot;Sonic&quot; in their names, and they may share few characteristics in common with the original Sonic trick. For example, the Twisted Sonic is made of a Charge motion followed by a Pass, unlike the original Sonic, which is made of a sole Charge motion combined with the pen switching between finger slots (called a Fingerswitch). Tricks in this category mostly use conical movements.

===Power tricks===
Power tricks encompass a specific type of advanced tricks and short combos. The definition of what qualifies as a &quot;power trick&quot; varies between different pen spinners, but they are usually said to be fingerless, aerial, and/or continuous in nature, thus greatly reliant on the momentum of the pen. French spinners often define power tricks as many difficult tricks linked together. Many power tricks are simply Continuous Fingerless Arounds or a Spin followed by a Fingerless Around. The use of power tricks in combos varies between spinners, but oftentimes power tricks are used at the end of the combo as a &quot;finisher&quot;. The term &quot;power tricker&quot; is applied to a spinner who uses power tricks very often and perhaps creates combos composed entirely of power tricks (&quot;power combos&quot;). Pen spinner Spinnerpeem greatly popularized the use of power tricks in combos and is said to be one of the first power trickers.

==Pen modifications==

Pen spinners often modify pens to construct a pen better suited for spinning. This practice of making pen modifications (&quot;pen mods&quot;) is called pen modding. Pen mods are usually made with different parts from separate pens and markers however some mods are made of or include parts such as paper, bullets, archery tips, and tape. While any pen that has been modified is technically a pen mod, mods are often balanced, longer, and heavier than non-modded pens to assist with the momentum requirements of certain tricks. Out of the hundreds of pen mods, prevalent ones include the BICtory, Metallic Comssa, RSVP MX, Waterfall, Dr. KT, and Buster CYL. There is some speculation that using a heavier mod when beginning to learn tricks will lead to worse performance due to excessive reliance on the mod&#x27;s momentum, rather than developing refined finger control.

In addition to modified pens, mass-produced spinning pens also exist. These pens are usually heavier than many pen mods, but ones with adjustable weights are available. Pen spinners often do not use these spinning pens because of the greater customization ability of their own modified pens.

One niche of pen modding involves spinners who favor aesthetically pleasing designs over a mod&#x27;s spinning functionality. To increase customization potential, such mods often use a pen with a clear barrel as the base. This allows the spinner to put a printed design called an insert into the barrel without affecting the tactile quality of the mod. Some spinners use stickers to help customize their mods, which may change the feel of the mod due to the uneven surface it creates. Common mods with more custom aesthetic options include the RSVP MX, Fir3fly G3 Mod, and Ayatori Mod.

Another aspect of pen modding is Grip Cuts, where the modder cuts a design into a grip piece to further increase the aesthetic quality. Despite this, grip cuts are often impractical since intricate cuts can easily be unintentionally affected by Wiper tricks, which involve grasping the mod at the grip.

<text>Agave vilmoriniana, sometimes misspelled &quot;vilmoriana&quot;, and popularly known as octopus agave, is a species of agave endemic to Mexico. It is known for its untoothed arching and twisting leaves.

==Taxonomy==
Wild plants had been found in 1899 by Joseph Nelson Rose near Guadalajara, Jalisco. The species was named by Alwin Berger in 1913 in honor of Maurice de Vilmorin, based on specimens collected by Leon Diguet and grown at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.

==Distribution==
In nature, the octopus agave prefers the cliffs of of southern Sonora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Durango, Nayarit and Aguascalientes, typically between elevations of 600 to 1,700 meters.
==Uses==
&quot;Agave vilmoriniana&quot; has one of the highest concentrations of the sapogenin smilagenin; in parts of México, the leaves are cut and dried, and the fibers are beaten to make them into a brush with built-in soap.

The &quot;octopus agave&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental plant for planting in arid gardens and containers.

<doc id="727012" wikidata="Q228552" url="?curid=727012" title="End-of-train device">
<text>The end of train device (ETD), sometimes referred to as an EOT, flashing rear-end device (FRED) or sense and braking unit (SBU) is an electronic device mounted on the end of freight trains in replacement of a caboose. They are divided into three categories: &quot;dumb&quot; units, which only provide a visible indication of the rear of the train with a flashing red taillight; &quot;average intelligence&quot; units with a brake pipe pressure gauge; and &quot;smart&quot; units, which send back data to the crew in the locomotive via radio-based telemetry. They originated in North America, and are also used elsewhere in the world, where they may include complete End of Train Air System (ETAS) or Sense and Brake Unit (SBU) devices.

== Tail lamps ==
The earliest known method of showing the position of and completeness of a train was by the Stockton and Darlington Railway in the 1830s. These early references are to the use of a burning brazier on the rear of the locomotive. It is easy to imagine that the danger represented by this was as significant as the risks it was trying to counter.

The Liverpool and Manchester Railway were the first to codify the requirement for a tail Lamp in their 1840 Rules and Regulations that a red tail Lamp must be carried on each train. The purpose of this was for signallers working under the absolute block system to ensure that trains were complete when passing their signal box.

Such lamps were required to be carried by the rear coach of passenger trains and, for freight trains, the brake van (caboose) until their abolition (subsequently, the rear freight wagon must carry such a lamp). Locomotives and multiple units must also display a red light at the rear, however this is usually achieved by a lamp or light built into the train.
== End of train devices ==

=== Design and use ===
A &quot;dumb&quot; ETD can be as simple as a red flag attached to the coupler on the last car of the train, whereas &quot;smart&quot; devices monitor functions such as brake line pressure and accidental separation of the train using a motion sensor, functions that were previously monitored by a crew in the caboose. The ETD transmits data via a telemetry link to the Head-of-Train Device (HTD) in the locomotive, known colloquially among railroaders as a &quot;Wilma,&quot; after cartoon character Wilma Flintstone. In Canada, this device is known as a sense and braking unit (SBU).

A typical HTD contains several lights indicating telemetry status and rear end movement, along with a digital readout of the brake line pressure from the ETD. It also contains a toggle switch used to initiate an emergency brake application from the rear end. In modern locomotives, the HTD is built into the locomotive&#x27;s computer system, and the information is displayed on the engineer&#x27;s computer screen.

Railroads have strict government-approved air brake testing procedures for various circumstances when assembling trains or switching out cars en route. After a cut is made between cars in a train and the train is rejoined, in addition to other tests, the crew must verify that the brakes apply and release on the rear car (to ensure that all of the brake hoses are connected and the angle cocks, or valves, are opened). In most cases, the engineer is able to use information from the ETD to verify that the air pressure reduces and increases at the rear of the train accordingly, indicating proper brake pipe continuity. This device is said to constitute a fail-safe condition.
The DPS ETD reduced labor costs, as well as the costs of the purchase and upkeep of cabooses. The Brotherhood of Conductors and Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen were also greatly affected by ETD, as this electronic unit replaced two crewmen per train. The widespread use of ETDs has made the caboose nearly obsolete. Some roads still use cabooses where the train must be backed up, on short local runs, as rolling offices, or railroad police stations and as transportation for right-of-way maintenance crews. In some cases (see photo) instead of hitching a caboose, an employee stands on the last car when the train is backing up.

===Evolution===
The first ETD use is attributed to Florida East Coast Railway in 1968, soon after which other Class I railroads began using ETDs as well. By the mid-1980s they were common equipment. Early models were little more than a brake line connection / termination, a battery and flashing tail light. As their use became more widespread through the 1980s, ETDs were equipped with radio telemetry transmitters to send brake pressure data to a receiver in the locomotive. To reduce the cost of battery replacements, ambient light sensors were added so the flashing light on the ETD would illuminate only during dusk and after dark. Later models have a small turbine-powered electrical generator using air pressure from the brake line to power the ETD&#x27;s radio and sensors.

The one-way communication of brake data from the ETD to the locomotive evolved into two-way communication that enables the engineer to apply the brakes from both ends of the train simultaneously in an emergency. This is useful in the event that a blockage (or an unopened valve) in the train&#x27;s brake line is preventing dumping the air pressure and causing all of the brakes in the train going into an emergency application. Such a situation could be dangerous, as stopping distance increases with fewer functioning brakes. Dumping the brake line pressure from both the front and rear of the train simultaneously ensures that the entire train applies all of its brakes in emergency. Other electronics within the ETD were also enhanced, and many now include GPS receivers as well as the two-way radio communications.

==Last vehicle board==

Last vehicle board, often abbreviated as LV board, is a signaling board used on trains in some countries.

===In India===

The last vehicle of a train is supposed to carry a red lamp at the rear. Earlier, the requirement was for merely an oil lamp, which was often missing or very feeble. In recent years provision of an electric lamp, as mandated by the rules, has become more common.

Last vehicle indications are of different types. A large &#x27;X&#x27; is often seen painted on the rear of the coach that is the last one. A set of concentric circles may also be seen, although this seems to be going out of use as of 2008. EMU/DMU rakes have a smaller painted &#x27;X&#x27; (red on white) at the rear, or sometimes a series of diagonal strokes painted on; these painted symbols are all in addition to the lamp mentioned above. In addition, a small board with the letters &quot; (Last Vehicle, painted black on yellow) is often attached to the rear of the vehicle.

If a train passes by a station or signal cabin without the appropriate last vehicle indication (or without confirmation of the number of coaches or wagons), it is assumed that the train has separated and suitable emergency procedures are brought into play.

There are some cases where a last vehicle indication is not required — for instance, when the number of coaches or wagons in a train can be passed on to each block section after verification from the previous block section at the time the line clear indication is obtained (and with exchange of private numbers). The information is also provided to the section controllers. In some cases when working entirely within one block section, an &quot; sign is not needed if the number of coaches or wagons is communicated by telephone to the next station.

===In Sri Lanka===

The Last Vehicle (LV) board is also used by Sri Lanka Railways. This board is used for same purpose and is usually hung in a buffer of the last carriage. However, in DMUs, to indicate the last carriage (usually a driving/trailer car) red lights are used.

<text>A limited-slip differential (LSD) is a type of differential gear train that allows its two output shafts to rotate at different speeds but limits the maximum difference between the two shafts. Limited-slip differentials are often known by the generic trademark Positraction, a brand name owned by General Motors and originally used for its Chevrolet branded vehicles.

In an automobile, such limited-slip differentials are sometimes used in place of a standard differential, where they convey certain dynamic advantages, at the expense of greater complexity.

==Early history==
In 1932, Ferdinand Porsche designed a Grand Prix racing car for the Auto Union company. The high power of the design caused one of the rear wheels to experience excessive wheel spin at any speed up to . In 1935, Porsche commissioned the engineering firm ZF to design a limited-slip differential to improve performance. The ZF &quot;sliding pins and cams&quot; became available, and one example was the Type B-70 used during the Second World War in the military VWs (Kübelwagen and Schwimmwagen), although technically this was not a limited-slip differential, but a system composed of two freewheels, which sent the whole of the engine power to the slower-turning of the two wheels.

Limited-slip differentials were widely introduced by U.S. automakers in the late 1950s and were marketed under a wide variety of trademarked names. In early 1956, Packard introduced a clutch-type limited-slip differential under the Twin Traction trademark, promoting it as an aid for driving in severe winter weather. In 1957, General Motors (GM) introduced a competing system for Chevrolet branded vehicles under the Positraction name. Within a few years, other American automotive brands introduced similar systems under a variety of names, including Safe-T-Track for GM&#x27;s Pontiac brand and Anti Spin for its Oldsmobile brand, while the Ford Motor Company introduced Traction-Lok for Ford vehicles and Directed Power for its Lincoln cars. Chrysler purchased Power-Lok units from Dana Incorporated and Spin-Resistant units from Borg-Warner, marketing both under the Sure-Grip name on Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth vehicles. Limited-slip differentials became very popular and sought after during the muscle car era in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite the myriad marketing names used by competing brands, the popularity of Chevrolet vehicles resulted in Positraction becoming a generic trademark in the U.S. for limited-slip differentials generally.

==Characteristics==
The main advantage of a limited-slip differential is demonstrated by considering the case of a standard (or &quot;open&quot;) differential in off-roading or snow situations where one wheel begins to slip. In such a case with a standard differential, the slipping or non-contacting wheel will receive the majority of the power (in the form of low-torque, high-rpm rotation), while the contacting wheel will remain stationary with respect to the ground. The torque transmitted by an open differential will always be equal at both wheels; if one tire is on a slippery surface, the supplied torque will easily overcome the available traction at a very low number. For example, the right tire might begin to spin as soon as of torque is placed on it, since it is on an icy surface. Since the same amount of torque is always felt at both wheels, regardless of the speed at which they are turning, this means that the wheel with traction cannot receive more than of torque either, which is far less than is required to move the vehicle. Meanwhile, the tire on the slippery surface will simply spin, absorbing all of the actual &quot;power&quot; output (which is a function of torque provided over the course of revolutions), even though both wheels are provided the same (very low) amount of torque. In this situation, a limited-slip differential prevents excessive power from being allocated to one wheel, and so keeps both wheels in powered rotation. 

The advantages of LSD in high-power, rear-wheel drive automobiles were demonstrated during the United States &quot;Muscle-Car&quot; era from the mid 1960s through the early 1970s. Cars of this era normally were rear-wheel drive and did not feature independent suspension for the rear tires (but instead used a live axle). With a live axle, when high torque is applied through the differential, the traction on the right rear tire is lower as the axle naturally wants to turn with the torsion of the drive shaft (but is held stationary by being mounted to the vehicle frame). This coined the terms &quot;one wheel peel&quot; or &quot;one tire fire&quot;. As such, &quot;Muscle-Cars&quot; with LSD or &quot;posi&quot; (positraction) had a distinct advantage to their wheel-spinning counterparts.

Mechanical limited-slip differentials are considered essential to perform a proper drift.

==Basic principle of operation==
Both limited-slip differentials and open differentials have a gear train that allows the output shafts to spin at different speeds while holding the sum of their speeds proportional to that of the input shaft.

Automotive limited-slip differentials have some type of mechanism that applies a torque (internal to the differential) that resists the relative motion of the output shafts. In simple terms, this means they have some mechanism which resists a speed difference between the outputs, by creating a resisting torque between either the two outputs, or the outputs and the differential housing. There are many mechanisms used to create this resisting torque. Types of limited-slip differential typically are named from the type of the resisting mechanism. Examples include viscous and clutch-based LSDs. The amount of limiting torque provided by these mechanisms varies by design.

A limited-slip differential has a more complex torque-split and should be considered in the case when the outputs are spinning the same speed and when spinning at different speeds. The torque difference between the two axles is called &quot;Trq d &quot;. (In this work it is called &quot;Trq f &quot; for torque friction). &quot;Trq d &quot; is the difference in torque delivered to the left and right wheel. The magnitude of &quot;Trq d &quot; comes from the slip-limiting mechanism in the differential and may be a function of input torque (as in the case of a gear differential), or the difference in the output speeds (as in the case of a viscous differential).

The torque delivered to the outputs is:

*&quot;Trq 1 = ½ Trq in + ½ Trq d &quot; for the slower output
*&quot;Trq 2 = ½ Trq in – ½ Trq d &quot; for the faster output

When traveling in a straight line, where one wheel starts to slip (and spin faster than the wheel with traction), torque is reduced to the slipping wheel (&quot;Trq 2 &quot;) and provided to the slower wheel (&quot;Trq 1 &quot;).

In the case when the vehicle is turning and neither wheel is slipping, the inside wheel will be turning slower than the outside wheel. In this case the inside wheel will receive more torque than the outside wheel, which can result in understeer.

When both wheels are spinning at the same speed, the torque distribution to each wheel is:

*&quot;Trq (1 or 2) = ½ Trq in ±(½ Trq d )&quot; while
*&quot;Trq 1 +Trq 2 =Trq in &quot;.

This means the maximum torque to either wheel is statically indeterminate but is in the range of &quot;½ Trq in ±( ½ Trq d )&quot;.

==Types==
Several types of LSD are commonly used in passenger cars.
*Fixed value
*Torque sensitive
*Speed sensitive
*Electronically controlled

===Fixed value===

In this differential the maximum torque difference between the two outputs, &quot;Trq d &quot;, is a fixed value at all times regardless of torque input to the differential or speed difference between the two outputs. Typically this differential used spring-loaded clutch assemblies.

=== Torque sensitivity (HLSD)===

These limited-slip differentials use helical gears, clutches or cones (an alternative type of clutch) where the engagement force of the gears or clutch is a function of the input torque applied to the differential (as the engine applies more torque the gears or clutches grip harder and &quot;Trq d &quot; increases).
Torque sensing LSDs respond to driveshaft torque, so that the more driveshaft input torque present, the harder the clutches, cones or gears are pressed together, and thus the more closely the drive wheels are coupled to each other. Some include spring loading to provide some small torque so that with little or no input torque (trailing throttle/gearbox in neutral/main clutch depressed) the drive wheels are minimally coupled. The amount of preload (hence static coupling) on the clutches or cones is affected by the general condition (wear) and by how tightly they are loaded.

====Clutch, cone-type, or plate LSD====
The clutch type has a stack of thin clutch-discs, half of which are coupled to one of the drive shafts, the other half of which are coupled to the spider gear carrier. The clutch stacks may be present on both drive shafts, or on only one. If on only one, the remaining drive shaft is linked to the clutched drive shaft through the spider gears. In a cone type the clutches are replaced by a pair of cones which are pressed together achieving the same effect.

One method for creating the clamping force is the use of a cam-ramp assembly such as used in a Salisbury/ramp style LSD. The spider gears mount on the pinion cross shaft which rests in angled cutouts forming cammed ramps. The cammed ramps are not necessarily symmetrical. If the ramps are symmetrical, the LSD is 2 way. If they are saw toothed (i.e. one side of the ramp is vertical), the LSD is 1 way. If both sides are sloped, but are asymmetric, the LSD is 1.5 way.

An alternative is to use the natural separation force of the gear teeth to load the clutch. An example is the center differential of the 2011 Audi Quattro RS 5.

As the input torque of the driveshaft tries to turn the differential center, internal pressure rings (adjoining the clutch stack) are forced sideways by the pinion cross shaft trying to climb the ramp, which compresses the clutch stack. The more the clutch stack is compressed, the more coupled the wheels are. The mating of the vertical ramp (80–85° in practice to avoid chipping) surfaces in a one-way LSD on overrun produces no cam effect or corresponding clutch stack compression.

====2-Way, 1-Way, 1.5-Way====
Broadly speaking, there are three input torque states: load, no load, and over run. During load conditions, as previously stated, the coupling is proportional to the input torque. With no load, the coupling is reduced to the static coupling. The behavior on over run (particularly sudden throttle release) determines whether the LSD is 1 way, 1.5 way, or 2 way.

A 2-way differential will have the same limiting torque &quot;Trq d &quot; in both the forward and reverse directions. This means the differential will provide some level of limiting action under engine braking. The early Packard Twin Traction unit is designed to function in this manner, which was promoted to provide a different benefit: if one rear drive wheel momentarily leaves the ground when it hits a bump with the differential under load, the airborne wheel will not spin freely and cause the vehicle to break traction when the spinning wheel touches the ground again.

A 1-way differential will provide its limiting action in only one direction. When torque is applied in the opposite direction it behaves like an open differential. In the case of a FWD car it is argued to be safer than a 2-way differential. The argument is if there is no additional coupling on over run, i.e. a 1-way LSD as soon as the driver lifts the throttle, the LSD unlocks and behaves somewhat like a conventional open differential. This is also the best for FWD cars, as it allows the car to turn in on throttle release, instead of ploughing forward.

A 1.5-way differential refers to one where the forward and reverse limiting torques, &quot;Trq d_fwd, d_rev &quot;, are different but neither is zero as in the case of the 1-way LSD. This type of differential is common in racing cars where a strong limiting torque can aid stability under engine braking.

====Geared LSD====
Geared, &quot;torque-sensitive&quot; mechanical limited-slip differentials use worm gears and spur gears to distribute and differentiate input power between two drive wheels or front and back axles. This is a completely separate design from the most common beveled spider gear designs seen in most automotive applications. As torque is applied to the gears, they are pushed against the walls of the differential housing, creating friction. The friction resists the relative movement of the outputs and creates the limiting torque &quot;Trq d &quot;.

Unlike other friction-based LSD designs that combine a common spider gear &quot;open&quot; differential in combination with spring-loaded friction components that inhibit differentiation, the torque bias sensing design is inherent in its design, not as an add-on, but is still an LSD type (a design is selected which has inefficient gearing). The result is a differential that does not bind up like some LSD types and locking ones, but still gives increased power delivery under many road conditions.

Examples include:
* Torsen T-1 is the brand name of the original Gleasman differential invented by Vernon Gleasman &quot;circa&quot; 1949 (US Patent 2,559,916 applied in 1949, granted 1951). The original Gleasman design was sold to The Gleason Works (later named Gleason Corporation), who started marketing it in 1982. The original T-1 model is incompatible with c-clip drive axles, which limited its use with many cars and pick-up trucks of the time. However, the original Torsen differential was used in racing by Mario Andretti and Paul Newman with great success. All later worm gear LSD designs were derived from the original Gleasman differential. The T-1 is original equipment in the Audi Quattro, Subaru Impreza WRX STI, Toyota Mega Cruiser and AM General HMMWV &quot;Humvee&quot;.
* Torsen T-2 was a new Gleasman design &quot;circa&quot; 1984 (US Patent application WO1984003745 A1) that is compatible with c-clip axles. The new design, along with a merger creating Zexel-Gleason U.S.A. increased Torsen availability for OEM and aftermarket applications. Variants include the T-2R, which includes a Positraction style clutch pack that gives preload for racing purposes; and the T-3, a dual differential intended for AWD applications. The T-2 is original equipment in many high performance cars and pick-up trucks. 
* Quaife differential, sold under the name Automatic Torque Biasing Differential (ATB Differential®️), covered by European Patent No. 130806A2. The Quaife version is most established in Europe and other markets other than the US, providing extensive aftermarket support for European and Japanese brand cars, especially front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive applications. The Mk1 &amp; Mk2 (optional on later Mk3) Ford Focus RS used the Quaife ATB Differential®️ as original equipment.
* Eaton Corporation is the latest owner of the Truetrac differential, which has been in production for many years. Its design is similar to the Torsen T-2 (slightly less torque bias), and is an aftermarket part for many popular US-made solid axles for rear-wheel drive and 4x4 pick-up trucks. The Truetrac is most often used in the front axle of 4x4 pick-up trucks intended for off-road use, in combination with locking center and rear differentials. As is the case with all geared LSD designs, the Truetrac does not have any negative impact on steering that most other LSD and &quot;locker&quot; designs are prone to.

===Speed sensitivity===
Speed-sensitive differentials limit the torque difference between the outputs, &quot;Trq d &quot;, based on the difference in speed between the two output shafts. Thus for small output speed differences the differential’s behavior may be very close to an open differential. As the speed difference increases, the limiting torque increases. This results in different dynamic behavior as compared to a torque sensitive differential.

====Viscous (VLSD)====
The &quot;viscous type&quot; is generally simpler because it relies on hydrodynamic friction from fluids with high viscosity. Silicone-based oils are often used. Here, a cylindrical chamber of fluid filled with a stack of perforated discs rotates with the normal motion of the output shafts. The inside surface of the chamber is coupled to one of the driveshafts, and the outside coupled to the differential carrier. Half of the discs are connected to the inner, the other half to the outer, alternating inner/outer in the stack. Differential motion forces the interleaved discs to move through the fluid against each other. In some viscous couplings when speed is maintained the fluid will accumulate heat due to friction. This heat will cause the fluid to expand, and expand the coupler causing the discs to be pulled together resulting in a non-viscous plate to plate friction and a dramatic drop in speed difference. This is known as the hump phenomenon and it allows the side of the coupler to gently lock. In contrast to the mechanical type, the limiting action is much softer and more proportional to the slip, and so is easier to cope with for the average driver. New Process Gear used a viscous coupling of the Ferguson style in several of their transfer cases including those used in the AMC Eagle.

Viscous LSDs are less efficient than mechanical types, that is, they &quot;lose&quot; some power. In particular, any sustained load which overheats the silicone results in sudden permanent loss of the differential effect. They do have the virtue of failing gracefully, reverting to semi-open differential behavior. Typically a visco-differential that has covered or more will be functioning largely as an open differential. The silicone oil is factory sealed in a separate chamber from the gear oil surrounding the rest of the differential. This is not serviceable; when the differential&#x27;s behavior deteriorates, the VLSD center must be replaced.

====Gerotor pump====

This style limited-slip differential works by using a gerotor pump to hydraulically compress a clutch to transfer torque to the wheel that is rotating slower. The gerotor pump uses the differential carrier or cage to drive the outer rotor of the pump and one axle shaft to drive the inner rotor. When there is a difference between the left and right wheels&#x27; speed, the pump pressurizes the hydraulic fluid causing the clutch to compress, thereby causing the torque to be transferred to the wheel that is rotating slower. These pump-based systems have lower and upper limits on applied pressure which allows the differential to work like a conventional or open differential until there is a significant speed difference between the right and left wheel, and internal damping to avoid hysteresis. The newest gerotor pump based system has computer regulated output for more versatility and no oscillation. 

===Electronic===
An electronic limited-slip differential will typically have a planetary or bevel gear set similar to that of an open differential and a clutch pack similar to that in a torque sensitive or gerotor pump based differential. In the electronic unit the clamping force on the clutch is controlled externally by a computer or other controller. This allows the control of the differential’s limiting torque, &quot;Trq d &quot;, to be controlled as part of a total chassis management system. An example of this type of differential is Subaru’s DCCD used in the Subaru WRX STi. The Jeep Quadra-Drive II four-wheel-drive system produced beginning in 2005 utilizes this type of differential. Another example is the Porsche PSD system used on the Porsche 928. An additional example is the SAAB XWD (Haldex Generation 4) with eLSD, which uses a common (electronically controlled via the vehicle computer network) hydraulic power pack to control both the longitudinal and transversal torque transfer of the XWD system. The same Haldex system is used on several other GM Epsilon based vehicles such as the Cadillac SRX etc.

===Electronic systems: brake-based ===

These systems are alternatives to a traditional limited-slip differential. The systems harness various chassis sensors such as speed sensors, anti-lock braking system (ABS) sensors, accelerometers, and microcomputers to electronically monitor wheel slip and vehicle motion. When the chassis control system determines a wheel is slipping, the computer applies the brakes to that wheel. A significant difference between the limited-slip differential systems listed above and this brake-based system, is that brake-based systems do not inherently send the greater torque to the slower wheel, plus the added brake friction material wear that results from the use of such a system if the vehicle is driven in an environment where the brake-based system will activate on a regular basis.

BMW&#x27;s electronic limited-slip differential used on the F10 5 Series is an example of such a system. Another example began on the first year (1992) production of the re-styled, and new 4.6L V-8 overhead cam Ford Crown Victoria model with its optional anti-lock brakes. This option was available on the 1992 Crown Victoria, onward; on those cars equipped with anti-lock brakes.

==In popular culture==

In The Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;409&quot;, the lyrics mention the presence of a limited-slip differential: &quot;...My four-speed, dual-quad, Positraction 4-0-9 (4-0-9, 4-0-9).&quot;

In the 1992 film &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;, the proof of innocence of two young men falsely accused of murder relies heavily on a photograph of tire marks made by a car which has a limited-slip differential, which (as Marisa Tomei&#x27;s character famously declares in an Oscar-winning performance) &quot;was not available on the &#x27;64 Buick Skylark,&quot; the car driven by the defendants. She argues that the evidence proves, rather, that the getaway car was a 1963 Pontiac Tempest, which did offer an optional Safe-T-Track (Pontiac&#x27;s version of Positraction) limited-slip differential.

<text>Mills Edwin Godwin Jr. (November 19, 1914January 30, 1999) was an American politician who was the 60th and 62nd governor of Virginia for two non-consecutive terms, from 1966 to 1970 and from 1974 to 1978. Godwin was the first person to be elected governor of any state as a Democrat and a Republican.

He was the last Virginia governor elected as a part of the Byrd Machine, the conservative Democratic establishment that dominated the state&#x27;s politics for over three decades. He was succeeded by Linwood Holton, the first non-Democratic governor in over 80 years. By 1973, when he ran for a second term, Godwin had become a Republican, as the dominance of the Democrats in Virginia politics receded and the Byrd political machine had disintegrated.

== Early life and education ==
Godwin was born in the town of Chuckatuck in Nansemond County (now a neighborhood of Suffolk, Virginia), the son of Otelia Margaret (Darden) and Mills Edwin Godwin. He was educated at Old Dominion University and also received an LL.B. degree at the University of Virginia.

== Career ==

Godwin served in the Senate of Virginia between 1952 and 1962 and was the lieutenant governor between 1962 and 1966. In the state senate, Godwin was one of the leaders of the segregationist policy of &quot;massive resistance&quot;, which aimed to prevent the implementation of federal court decisions under &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; requiring that black students be admitted to white schools. However, during Virginia&#x27;s cultural transition in the 1960s, he was one of many Byrd Democrats who distanced themselves from the extreme positions of Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr. and concluded that obstinate resistance to integration could not continue.

With an eye to the 1965 gubernatorial race, Godwin reached out to African American voters during the 1964 presidential campaign by campaigning for President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had led the movement for enactment of the Civil Rights Act of that year.

In 1965, Godwin took the Democratic nomination for governor unopposed, without a primary election. His support of President Johnson the previous year, however, lost him the support of the most die-hard segregationists, who bolted from the Democratic Party to support William J. Story Jr., the candidate of the short-lived Conservative Party of Virginia. Godwin&#x27;s bid for governor in 1965 was endorsed by the local affiliates of both the NAACP and the AFL–CIO.

Despite the third-party challenge, Godwin defeated Republican Linwood Holton (who would succeed him as governor in 1970) by a 48%-36% margin, with Story winning 13 percent of the vote. (American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell, running as an independent, won 1.02 percent of the vote.)

After his first term ended in 1970, Godwin began to separate himself from the Democratic Party. He managed the U.S. Senate campaign of Harry F. Byrd Jr., who was running as an independent candidate. Godwin was denied a seat at the Democratic state convention in 1972, and he was a member in the Texas organization of &quot;Democrats for Nixon,&quot; supporting Republican Richard Nixon over the Democratic presidential nominee, George McGovern.

Lieutenant Governor Henry Howell had been elected to his office as an independent in a 1971 special election, against Democratic and Republican opposition; he ran as an independent for governor in 1973, as the Democrats failed to put up a candidate. Howell was a self-styled &quot;populist,&quot; but many conservatives saw him simply as a liberal whose push to the governor&#x27;s office they believed had to be stopped. Former governor Godwin was persuaded to run again by conservative Republicans who saw him as the most likely candidate to beat Howell. Although Godwin sought and won the Republican nomination, he did not declare that he had personally switched his party affiliation until his speech to the Republican convention in which he accepted his nomination &quot;as one of you.&quot; Godwin narrowly defeated Howell by a margin of 15,000 votes, a 50.7% to 49.3% margin, to win his second term. Virginia law prohibits incumbent governors for running for consecutive reelection; Godwin became the only Virginia governor to be elected to two terms in the 20th century. In another historic note, Godwin became the last governor of Virginia for 40 years whose party held the Presidency at the time of election, a distinction that ended with the election of Democrat Terry McAuliffe as governor in 2013.

As governor, Godwin abandoned the state&#x27;s &quot;pay as you go&quot; fiscal policy, which Virginia had followed since Harry F. Byrd&#x27;s governorship, by having the state issue bonds to pay for capital projects.

In December 1975, Governor Godwin ordered the James River and its tributaries closed to fishing from Richmond to the Chesapeake Bay. This order was the result of the improper handling and dumping of kepone into the James. Kepone is a chemical pesticide that was produced by Allied Signal Company in Hopewell, Virginia and caused a nationwide pollution controversy.

In 1976, Governor Godwin supported the bid of President Gerald R. Ford Jr., for the Republican presidential nomination, against challenger Ronald Reagan. The Virginia Republican Party convention of that year, however, elected a largely pro-Reagan delegation to the 1976 Republican National Convention, although as a courtesy Godwin was designated as co-chairman of the delegation (but was required to share the co-chairmanship with Reagan supporter Richard D. Obenshain).

After the end of his second gubernatorial term, Godwin worked behind the scenes in the Virginia Republican Party until shortly before his death.

His personal papers, including papers from his time as governor, are held by the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William &amp; Mary. His executive papers from his time as governor are held by the Library of Virginia.

== Personal life ==
He married Katherine Thomas Beale of Holland, also in Nansemond County. They adopted one child, Becky Godwin (1954–1968). In August 1968, while Governor Godwin was attending the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, Becky and her mother were vacationing at the Oceanfront area of Virginia Beach when Becky was killed in a lightning accident.

The family resided in Godwin&#x27;s hometown of Chuckatuck. In 1972, Nansemond County, including Chuckatuck, became the independent city of Nansemond. Only two years later, in 1974, Nansemond merged with neighboring Suffolk to form the modern city of Suffolk. It was the last of the cities of Hampton Roads to take their current form during a wave of political consolidations which began in 1952.

Godwin died in 1999 of pneumonia and is buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Suffolk.

== Legacy ==
His boyhood home, the Godwin–Knight House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Two schools in Virginia were named for him, including Mills E. Godwin High School in suburban Henrico, where the Becky Godwin Memorial Award is given annually to a senior selected by classmates, and Godwin Middle School in Prince William County, which was later renamed to George Hampton Middle School. Amid much controversy in 2016. Godwin was a leader of the &quot;massive resistance&quot; movement, which used state laws to close schools rather than comply with federal orders to open them to black students. 
Godwin died in 1999, when he was 84, and never publicly apologized for his support of segregated schools.

Godwin Drive is located in the city of Manassas, Virginia. The administration building at Virginia Wesleyan University is named Katherine B. &amp; Mills E. Godwin, Jr. Hall. The Psychology/Biology building on the campus of Old Dominion University is named Mills Godwin Life Science Building. The former student center at Norfolk State University was also named in his honor. The building was demolished in early 2010 as a modern student center opened on campus. The Godwin Building on the Northern Virginia Community College, Annandale campus is also named for him. A Becky Godwin Memorial Scholarship is also given to college students at Godwin&#x27;s former church, Oakland Christian Church, in Chuckatuck, Virginia. The church also dedicated a section of the church to Godwin known as the Godwin Building. Godwin Hall on the campus of James Madison University was completed in 1972 and was dedicated in honor of Godwin and his wife Katherine, who was a graduate of the university.

He was later elected to public office as a county prosecutor and the Attorney General of Virginia before being elected Governor of Virginia in 1997. After his gubernatorial tenure ended in 2002, Gilmore unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2008 and for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2008 and 2016 elections.

In November 2018, Gilmore was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as the U.S. Representative to United States Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a position which carries the rank of ambassador. His nomination was confirmed by a voice vote of the U.S. Senate on May 23, 2019. Gilmore was sworn in on June 25, 2019 and presented his credentials to OSCE Secretary General Thomas Greminger on July 2, 2019.

==Early life and education==
Gilmore was born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Margaret Evelyn (née Kandle), a church secretary, and James Stuart Gilmore Jr., a grocery store meat cutter. He graduated from John Randolph Tucker High School and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Virginia in 1971.

Gilmore met his future wife, Roxane Gatling, at a Jefferson Literary and Debating Society club meeting in the Fall of 1974 while he was a law student and she was an undergraduate. During her senior year, Gatling became ill with a serious recurrence of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. Jim Gilmore accompanied her to her chemotherapy treatments and hospitalizations. The couple married in on August 6, 1977, and had two sons, Jay and Ashton Gilmore.

==Military service==
In 1971, Gilmore volunteered to serve in the United States Army after attending college, receiving training and preparation for service in the Military Intelligence Corps at the newly created United States Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca in Arizona. Gilmore also received rigorous foreign language education at the United States Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California. Gilmore then worked for three years in the early 1970s, in the 650th Military Intelligence Group. Serving in West Germany during the Vietnam War and fluent in German, he served as a U.S. Army Counterintelligence Agent.

==Legal career==
Gilmore received his J.D. degree from University of Virginia Law School in 1977, A decade later, he was elected Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney in Henrico County and was re-elected in 1991. In 1981, Gilmore ran for the Virginia House of Delegates in the 32nd district, however he lost the general election. In 1993, he was elected Virginia&#x27;s attorney general, defeating Democratic nominee William D. Dolan III by more than 10 percentage points (958,982 to 749,565 votes). Gilmore resigned in 1997 to run for governor.

==Governor of Virginia==
In 1997, Gilmore faced then-Lieutenant Governor Don Beyer and Reform Party candidate Sue Harris Debauche in a bid to succeed George Allen as governor. Gilmore campaigned heavily on the twin promises of hiring 4,000 new teachers in public schools and phasing out Virginia&#x27;s personal property tax on automobiles. Gilmore was elected, winning 56% of the vote to Beyer&#x27;s 43%.

In his first year as governor, Gilmore pushed for car tax reduction legislation that was eventually passed by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly. The legislation reduced car taxes on all cars valued less than $1,000, and phased out the tax on auto values over $1,000 as follows: 12.5% reduction in 1998; 25% reduction in 1999; 47.5% reduction in 2000; 70% reduction in 2001; 100% reduction in 2002. Beginning in 2001, Virginia&#x27;s economy slowed and tax revenues flattened. In addition to a downturn in the national economy in 2001, Northern Virginia&#x27;s economy was severely impacted after terrorists flew a hijacked airplane into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on September 11, 2001, resulting in the closure of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport for 23 days. Despite the economic downturn, Gilmore insisted on advancing the car tax phase out from a 47.5% reduction of each taxpayer&#x27;s bill in 2000 to the scheduled 70% reduction in 2001. Gilmore signed an executive order, which was passed by the General Assembly, reducing state spending by all agencies, except for education, to keep the state&#x27;s budget balanced during the economic downturn. Democrats criticized the spending reductions and car tax cut. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Virginia&#x27;s politicians struggled to balance car-tax relief against demands for public services.&quot; When Gilmore left office in January 2002, the state&#x27;s &quot;rainy day fund,&quot; or revenue stabilization fund, had fallen to $900 million.

In April 1998, Gilmore&#x27;s first trip abroad as governor was to Germany with his Secretary of Commerce, Barry Duval. They sought to expand jobs and investment with German companies who at the time had invested more than $2 billion and 10,000 jobs in the Commonwealth. During his tenure, Gov. Gilmore was focused on creating jobs by leading several trade missions to: South America in 1999 (Argentina, Brazil, Chile); Asia in 2000 (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan); Europe again in 2001 (Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland). Mr. Gilmore, since leaving office, has also traveled to Pakistan, Australia, and Peru. He also traveled to Israel when he was Attorney General of Virginia in the early 1990s.

The Gilmore Administration implemented new Standards of Learning reforms in Virginia&#x27;s public schools. The Standards of Learning prescribed a uniform curriculum in mathematics, science, English and social studies and instituted new tests at the end of the third, fifth and eighth grades, as well as end-of-course tests in high school, to measure student achievement. During Gilmore&#x27;s term, Virginia&#x27;s public school students&#x27; scores increased on these state tests as well as nationally normed tests.

In 1999, Gilmore proposed and signed into law legislation that reduced tuitions at public colleges and universities by 20%. Gilmore also commissioned a Blue Ribbon Commission on Higher Education that studied accountability and governance of public colleges and universities. Gilmore&#x27;s Commission authored the first blueprint for decentralized regulatory and administrative authority to some universities in return for agreements to meet agreed upon performance objectives.

Gilmore also proposed and signed into law Virginia&#x27;s first stand-alone Martin Luther King Holiday. Prior to this proposal, Virginia had observed a combined Lee-Jackson-King Day that recognized Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Martin Luther King on the same day each year. Gilmore and his wife hosted a historic reception in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion for Coretta Scott King and announced a technology partnership between Virginia and the King Center for Nonviolence. Gilmore also proposed and funded a new African-American History Trail in Virginia and called upon the State Board of Education to include a more diverse range of historical figures in Virginia&#x27;s Social Studies curriculum. Test scores during Gilmore&#x27;s term showed a narrowing of the &quot;achievement gap&quot; between minority and white students. Gilmore significantly increased funding for two of Virginia&#x27;s historically black universities, Norfolk State University and Virginia State University.

Gilmore created the nation&#x27;s first state Secretary of Technology, a position first held by Donald Upson. Together they established a statewide technology commission, and signed into law the nation&#x27;s first comprehensive state Internet policy.

During his term, 37 people were executed in Virginia. Gilmore granted executive clemency to one death row inmate on the basis of mental illness. In another well publicized case, he pardoned Earl Washington, a former death row inmate, after DNA tests, ordered by Gilmore, implicated another person. Gilmore also ordered DNA tests in the case of Derek Rocco Barnabei; the tests confirmed Barnabei&#x27;s guilt and he was executed.

As governor, Gilmore signed into law legislation establishing a 24-hour waiting period and informed consent for women seeking an abortion, as well as a ban against partial birth abortion. Gilmore increased funding for adoption services. He also signed into law a bill that banned human cloning. In 1998, Gilmore went to court to try to prevent the removal of a feeding tube of a car crash victim, the former Kentucky news anchor Hugh Finn, who had suffered from a persistent vegetative state for several years. Gilmore lost his petition that removal of a feeding tube was not removal of artificial life support because it amounted to starvation of an infirm person who could not feed himself and Finn was allowed to die, upholding his wishes as he had expressed them to his family while he was working on developing a living will when still in good health that he wished not to be kept alive in such a state. As Attorney General of Virginia, Gilmore had defended a legal challenge to Virginia&#x27;s first parental notification law for minors seeking abortions.

The Virginia Constitution forbids any governor from serving consecutive terms, so Gilmore could not run for a second term in 2001. He was succeeded by Democrat Mark Warner, who took office in early 2002.

==Subsequent runs for office==
===2008 presidential candidacy===

A &quot;Draft Gilmore for President&quot; group was formed in August 2006 encouraging Gilmore to run for President of the United States.
On December 19, 2006, Gilmore announced he would form an exploratory committee to &quot;fill the conservative void&quot; in the race. On January 9, 2007, Gilmore officially filed papers with the Federal Election Commission to form the Jim Gilmore for President Exploratory Committee.

Gilmore said he represented &quot;the Republican wing of the Republican Party&quot; in the race for the 2008 Presidential nomination; the comment mirrored the slogan used by Howard Dean when seeking the Democratic nomination in the 2004 election, who lifted the slogan from Senator Paul Wellstone. Gilmore officially announced his candidacy on April 26, 2007.

In the first quarter of 2007 Gilmore raised $174,790, the second lowest of any of the major-party candidates. Gilmore hosted only one fundraiser in the first quarter due to a late exploratory announcement.

On July 14, 2007, Gilmore announced that he was ending his campaign. Gilmore said that it would be &quot;impractical&quot; to run, citing the difficulty of raising enough money to be competitive in early-voting states Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.

===2008 Senate campaign===

In an interview with &quot;Politico&quot;, Gilmore said that he had been approached to run for the Senate seat of John Warner, who had announced that he would retire at the end of his term in 2009. By the end of the summer, many media outlets, most notably &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, thought it would be a foregone conclusion that Gilmore would jump into the Senate race. Gilmore&#x27;s successor as governor, Mark Warner, had already announced in September, and 11th District Congressman Tom Davis had informally announced his candidacy a few days after Mark Warner&#x27;s announcement.

Gilmore lobbied strongly for choosing the party&#x27;s nominee at a statewide convention rather than a primary, claiming that a convention would cost only $1 million versus the $4 million required to run a primary campaign. This was no small consideration, as the race for the Democratic nomination essentially ended with Mark Warner&#x27;s entry into the race. It was understood that Warner would use his considerable wealth to self-finance his campaign. It was thought that a convention would favor Gilmore, since most of the delegates would come from the party&#x27;s activist base, which is tilted strongly to the right. A primary was thought to favor Davis due to his popularity in voter-rich Northern Virginia; Davis is a moderate Republican, and most Republicans in Northern Virginia tend to be more moderate than their counterparts elsewhere in the state. On October 13, 2007, the state party&#x27;s central committee voted 47–37 to hold a convention rather than a primary. With this decision, Gilmore said he was seriously considering a run for the Senate.

Gilmore formally announced his candidacy via a YouTube video on November 19, 2007. He said that he was running to give Virginia &quot;a strong and steady hand&quot; in the Senate.

Gilmore faced a challenge from his right in State Delegate Bob Marshall of Prince William County. Marshall charged Gilmore with being too soft on abortion. However, at the convention Gilmore won the nomination by a margin of only 65 votes out of 3,000 cast.

In the November election, Gilmore was heavily defeated, winning only 34 percent of the vote to Warner&#x27;s 65 percent. Gilmore only carried four counties in the state – Rockingham, Augusta, Powhatan and Hanover. In many cases, he lost in many areas of the state that are normally reliably Republican. This was the worst showing for a Republican Senate candidate in Virginia since Chuck Robb defeated Maurice Dawkins with 71 percent of the vote in 1988.

===2016 presidential candidacy===

On July 7, 2015, Gilmore told the Associated Press that he planned to announce his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination in the first week of August 2015. On July 29, Gilmore filed his candidacy for President of the United States with the Federal Election Commission. He announced his candidacy via an internet video clip the next day. The same evening, he appeared on &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot; as the &quot;center seat&quot; where panelists Charles Krauthammer, Julie Pace, and Steve Hayes questioned him on a variety of issues.

According to his campaign website, Gilmore&#x27;s main issues that he would address if elected president include preserving the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms, immigration and border re-enforcement, healthcare reform, and restoring America&#x27;s economy.

Gilmore was consistently one of the lowest-polling candidate in the 2016 GOP field. He rarely registered more than 1% in a national poll, often polling at 0%, and sometimes was not offered as a choice. This resulted in his polling at 0.0% in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; aggregate poll, and lack of showings in the earlier Real Clear Politics aggregate poll. Gilmore failed to qualify for all but two of the &quot;undercard&quot; lower-tier debates. He was the only commonly polled candidate to be left out of more than one undercard debate. Gilmore insisted that he was &quot;not going anywhere&quot; and would continue to run.

On January 26, 2016, after being denied participation in five consecutive debates, Gilmore was invited back for the &quot;undercard&quot; debate on January 28, his first debate since August. This was the last debate before the Iowa caucuses. The &quot;undercard&quot; debates were discontinued after the Iowa Caucuses.

In the 2016 Iowa Republican caucuses, Gilmore received 12 votes, not earning him any delegates. He then received 133 votes in the New Hampshire primary. Gilmore indicated he intended to continue his campaign into South Carolina. However, he suspended his campaign a week before that primary, on February 12, 2016.

==Appointments and other positions==

During his term as governor, Gilmore chaired the Congressional Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. The Commission was charged with the task of making recommendations to the United States Congress on Internet taxation. The Commission&#x27;s Report to Congress opposed taxation of the Internet.

Gilmore served on the board of Windmill International, a government contractor previously accused of trying to secure fraudulent contracts in Iraq. His service on the board was not mentioned in his campaign filings, as required. Gilmore was never accused of wrongdoing regarding fraud committed in Windmill International&#x27;s name.

From 1999 to 2003, Gilmore chaired the Congressional Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Capabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, nicknamed the Gilmore Commission. It presented five reports to Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and to Congress each December 15 from 1999 through 2003.

From January 2001 to January 2002, Gilmore was the Chairman of the Republican National Committee.

Gilmore is the President &amp; CEO of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank which was founded by Paul Weyrich. Gilmore has re-branded the Free Congress Foundation into the American Opportunity Foundation.

Gilmore has also served as Chairman of the National Council on Readiness &amp; Preparedness, a homeland security program focused on community involvement and public/private partnerships. He is also President of USA Secure, a non-profit homeland security think tank based in Washington, D.C.

From 2005 to 2017 he served on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association.

In 2021, Gilmore was interviewed, by contributors Christopher Lim and Kendall O&#x27;Donnell from the UK-based think-tank The Bruges Group on his time as United States Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the European Union, US - China relations, and the Biden Administration&#x27;s foreign policy. Gilmore criticised the G7&#x27;s B3W programme, saying there was &quot;zero discussion of [B3W] in the United States&quot;, and described President Biden&#x27;s relationship with European allies as &quot;a lot of public messaging, to be polite, and a lot of talk, to be not so polite&quot;. Gilmore was praised for &quot;asking hard-hitting, pertinent questions that need to be asked of the Biden Administration&quot;, and &quot;reaffirming [his] place as one of the GOP&#x27;s premier foreign policy minds&quot;

===Ambassador to the OSCE===
Gilmore was considered for the position of United States Ambassador to Germany by the first Trump administration, but ultimately not chosen. In November 2018, Gilmore was nominated as the next U.S. Representative to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe with the rank of ambassador. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on May 23, 2019. Gilmore took his oath of office on June 25, 2019 and presented his credentials to OSCE Secretary General Thomas Greminger on July 2, 2019.

<text>Artemisia annua, also known as sweet wormwood, sweet annie, sweet sagewort, annual mugwort or annual wormwood, is a common type of wormwood native to temperate Asia, but naturalized in many countries including scattered parts of North America.

An extract of &quot;A. annua&quot;, called artemisinin (or artesunate), is a medication used to treat malaria. Discovery of artemisinin and its antimalarial properties by the Chinese scientist Tu Youyou led to the award of the 2011 Lasker Prize and 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

==Description==
&quot;Artemisia annua&quot; belongs to the plant family of &quot;Asteraceae&quot; and is an annual short-day plant. Its stem is erect and brownish or violet-brown. The plant itself is hairless and naturally grows from 30 to 100 cm tall, although in cultivation plants can reach a height of 200 cm. The leaves of &quot;A. annua&quot; have a length of 3–5 cm and are divided by deep cuts into two or three small leaflets. The intensive aromatic scent of the leaves is characteristic. The artemisinin content in dried leaves is in between 0% and 1.5%. New hybrids of &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; developed in Switzerland can reach a leaf artemisinin content of up to 2%. Also, four new genotypes developed by a collaboration between the USDA and Purdue University with 2% leaf artemisinin were recently released for researchers involved in the production of artemisinin. The small flowers have a diameter of 2–2.5 mm and are arranged in loose panicles. Their color is greenish-yellow. The seeds are brown achenes with a diameter of only 0.6–0.8 mm. Their thousand-kernel weight (TKW) averages around 0.03 g (in comparison, wheat has a TKW of approximately 45 g).

== Agricultural practice ==
The growing period of &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; from seeding through to harvest is 190–240 days, depending on the climate and altitude of the production area. The plant is harvested at the beginning of flowering when the artemisinin content is highest. Dry leaf yields of &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; plantations vary between 0.5 and 3 tonnes per hectare.

In terms of the climate &quot;A. annua&quot; prefers sunny and warm conditions. Its optimal growth temperature lies between 20 and 25 °C. Annual temperature sums of 3500–5000 °C (sum of temperatures higher than 10 °C over one year) are required to guarantee a proper maturing. The rainfall during the growing season should not be less than 600 mm (annual rainfall higher than 1150 mm). Especially the seedlings of &quot;A. annua&quot;. are susceptible to drought or water logging. The mature plants on the other hand are quite resistant to those climate conditions. Nevertheless, the preferred soil conditions for &quot;A. annua&quot; are light soils with deep topsoils and good drainage properties. But it is reported, that the plant is adaptable to different soil types. Paired with the relatively low demand on the environment &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; can have characteristics of a neophytic plant.

&quot;A. annua&quot; is best sown in rows to facilitate the removal of weeds, which has to be done mechanically or manually because herbicides are typically not used. It is recommended to sow 1.4 – 2 seeds per square meter. The fertilizer requirements are at a low level. Potassium should be used as base fertilizer. It is taken up by the plant during the whole growing season. Nitrogen is required during early branching stages, an amount of approximately 70 kg N/ha is sufficient for the plant. Phosphate on the other hand is required during the blooming stages. Phosphate fertilization can lead to a higher artemisinin content in the leaves. The application of salicylic acid to the leaves shortly before harvesting the plant also can raise its artemisinin content. Besides few viral diseases, &quot;Artemisia a.&quot; has no major diseases that need to be controlled.

The harvest of the plant is best done when plants reach peak artemisinin, which may be in the state of flower budding, for early-flowering cultivars. However, for late flowering cultivars that were reported to reach peak artemisinin in early September in the United States, the harvest will happen about a month before the flowering stage when plants produce more artemisinin in leaves. This peak artemisinin in early September was observed for Brazilian, Chinese, and Swiss clones in West Virginia. Drying the plants before extraction will significantly increase artemisinin as dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid seem to be converted into artemisinin. The whole plant is harvested and cut into branches which are dried in the sun or an oven. Some report that drying artemisia plants at 45 °C for 24h increased artemisinin and maintained leaf antioxidant capacity. The dry branches are shaken or beaten to separate the leaves from the stem. The leaves are then packed into fabric bags and shipped for further processing. The optimum storage conditions are either 20 °C with 85% relative humidity (RH) or 30 °C with 30–40% RH.

==Artemisinin and other phytochemicals==

In 1971, scientists demonstrated that the plant extracts had antimalarial activity in primate models, and in 1972 the active ingredient, artemisinin (formerly referred to as arteannuin), was isolated and its chemical structure described. Artemisinin may be extracted using a low-boiling-point solvent, such as diethylether, is found in the glandular trichomes of the leaves, stems, and inflorescences, and is concentrated in the upper portions of plants within new growth.

The first isolation of artemisinin from the herb occurred from a military project known as Project 523, following the study of traditional medicine pharmacopoeias performed by Tu Youyou and other researchers within the project. &quot;A. annua&quot; contains diverse phytochemicals, including polyphenols such as coumarins, flavones, flavonols, and phenolic acids which have unknown biological properties in vivo. Other phytochemicals include 38 sesquiterpenes. Dihydroartemisinin is the active metabolite of artemisinin, and artesunate is a water-soluble derivative of artemisinin.

==Malaria treatment==

Research to develop antimalarial drugs led to the discovery of artemisinin in the 1970s by the Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, who shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. An improved extract was obtained by using a low-temperature ether-based extraction method, further showing the artemisinin derivative artemether to be an effective antimalarial drug.

Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone with an endoperoxide bridge and has been produced as an antimalarial drug. The efficacy of tea, made with either water or urine and &quot;A. annua&quot;, for the treatment of malaria is dubious, and is discouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Research has found that artemisinin is not soluble in water and the concentrations in these infusions are considered insufficient to treat malaria. A 2012 review stated that artemisinin-based remedies are the most effective drugs for the treatment of malaria. A 2013 review suggested that although &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; may not cause hepatotoxicity, haematotoxicity, or hyperlipidemia, it should be used cautiously during pregnancy owing to a potential risk of embryotoxicity at a high dose.

The WHO has approved riamet (Coartem), a combination of lumefantrine (120 mg) and artemether (an artemisinin derivative extracted with ether, 20 mg) in repeat treatments over two days, producing efficacy of up to 98% against malaria.

===Mechanism===
The proposed mechanism of action of artemisinin involves cleavage of endoperoxide bridges by iron, producing free radicals (hypervalent iron-oxo species, epoxides, aldehydes, and dicarbonyl compounds) which damage biological macromolecules causing oxidative stress in the cells of the malaria parasite. Malaria is caused by apicomplexans, primarily &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, which largely reside in red blood cells and contain iron-rich heme-groups (in the form of hemozoin). In 2015, artemisinin was shown to bind to a large number of cell targets, indicating its potential for diverse effects.

=== Artemisinin resistance ===
Despite global efforts in combating malaria, it remains a large burden for the population, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. As of 2013, it seems that the pathogenic agent of malaria is becoming resistant to artemisinin-based drugs. Emergence of artemisinin resistance has been identified in Cambodia and the border of Thailand. Although the WHO recommends artemisinin-based remedies for treating uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin resistance has become a concern. The causes that affected the emergence of artemisinin resistance include the use of artemisinin-based remedies. Encouraging herbal alternatives are in the pipeline, but a more dependable solution for the eradication of malaria would be the creation of an effective vaccination. Resistance will likely spread to other endemic areas across the world.

==Traditional medicine==
In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), &quot;A. annua&quot; is prepared with hot water to treat fever. Owing to duplication in ancient TCM sources, &quot;A. annua&quot; is more commonly referred to as &quot;qinghao&quot; (), the modern Chinese name for &quot;Artemisia carvifolia&quot;, as opposed to its current Chinese name &quot;huanghuahao&quot;.

It is located in the southern part of the capital Luanda, situated in the Luanda Province. &quot;Quatro de Fevereiro&quot; means 4 February, which is an important national holiday in Angola, marking the start of the armed struggle against the Portuguese colonial regime on 4 February 1961. In 2018, about 5.6 million passengers were handled.

Starting 2024, the airport will be replaced by the new Dr. Antonio Agostinho Neto International Airport.

==History==
The construction of the airport began in 1951, in order to serve the capital of the former-Portuguese Overseas Province of Angola. It was inaugurated in 1954, by the Portuguese President Craveiro Lopes, which in his honor, the airport was named &quot;Aeroporto Presidente Craveiro Lopes&quot; (President Craveiro Lopes Airport).

In August, September, and October 1975 the airport hosted tens of thousands of mostly white Portuguese Angolans fleeing to Lisbon (during &quot;Operation Air Bridge&quot;) who camped-out while awaiting evacuation flights during the weeks before Angola&#x27;s Independence.

Following Angola&#x27;s independence from Portugal (in November 1975), the airport was renamed &quot;Aeroporto Quatro de Fevereiro Internacional&quot; (Fourth of February International Airport) to commemorate the events leading to the independence of the state.

The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 05/23 is and 07/25 is .

<text>Cahul (; also known by alternative names) is a city and municipality in southern Moldova. The city is the administrative center of Cahul District; it also administers one village, Cotihana. As of 2014 census, the city has a population of 30,018.

==Etymology and names==
The city of Cahul (, ) is believed to have been inhabited for many centuries, although it has had a number of different names over the years – the name Scheia (Old Romanian for &quot;Bulgarian&quot;) was recorded in 1502, and the name Frumoasa (&quot;Beautiful&quot; in Romanian) was recorded in 1716. The modern name was given to the settlement after the Battle of Kagul, which was fought nearby.

==History==

The city&#x27;s location had made it a frequent battleground for a number of armies, with possession of frequently switching between countries such as Principality of Moldavia, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire.

The city was a part of Moldavia before 1812, then Russia from 1812 to 1856, then again Moldavia/Romanian Principalities (1856–1878), then Russia again (1878–1918), then Romania again (1918–1940), then the Soviet Union (1940–1941), then Romania again (1941–1944), the Soviet Union again (1944–1991) and finally Moldova (1991 to the present).

Apart from the battles that have been fought over it, Cahul is also known for its thermal spas and for its folk music.

==Demographics==
According to the 2014 census, the population of Cahul amounted to 30,018 inhabitants (making it the seventh largest city in Moldova), a decrease compared to the previous census in 2004, when 36,805 inhabitants were registered. Of these, 13,951 were men and 16,067 were women. 


&quot;Footnotes&quot;: 

* &quot;There is an ongoing controversy regarding the ethnic identification of Moldovans and Romanians.&quot;

* &quot;Moldovan language is one of the two local names for the Romanian language in Moldova. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence, thus giving official status to the name &quot;Romanian&quot;.&quot;

As of 1920, the population was estimated to be 12,000. Groups settled in the area included Romanians, Jews, Germans, Bulgarians, and Greeks.

==Culture==
Cahul is home to the Cahul Musical-Drama Theatre, Cahul History Museum, and other public institutions and monuments. Every two years, at the beginning of July, in Cahul takes place an important folk music festival, &quot;Nufărul Alb&quot; (&quot;White waterlilies&quot;).

==Twin towns – sister cities==

==Consulates in Cahul==
In Cahul is located one of the two Consulates General of Romania in Moldova. On 2 November 2009 the President of Romania Traian Băsescu has signed the decrees on opening of Romanian general consulat in Cahul. &quot;The opening of the Romanian consulates in Bălți and Cahul will be beneficial for the Moldovan people, who have encountered economic and time-related problems as they have to travel to the consulate in Chișinău,&quot; Moldova&#x27;s Foreign Minister Iurie Leancă said, commenting on the Băsescu&#x27;s decree.

Romania asked the approval for the opening of the consulate as early as in 2006, in order to easy thus the process of granting visas to the Moldovan citizens more easily, after Romania&#x27;s accession with the European Union on 1 January 2007. Initially, the communist authorities in Chişinău gave their approval for the opening of the two consular offices, but they later came with the condition Romania to accept two consular offices of the Republic of Moldova on its territory too, in Iaşi and Constanţa. Moreover, the former communist rule in Chişinău conditioned the signing of the small border traffic agreement on the signing of the Basic Political Treaty between the two countries and also of the agreement referring to the delimitation of the border.

On 28 January 2010, Traian Băsescu visited the future headquarters of the Romanian consulate in Cahul. Speaking about the opening of the two Romanian consulates in Bălți and Cahul, Băsescu said that the consulate in Cahul could be opened in 2–3 weeks.

The consulate has 17 employees: Consul General, two consuls, two main consular officers, six major referers, two drivers, two skilled workers and two guards. The Consul General is Ms. Anca Corfu.

<doc id="727053" wikidata="Q6888537" url="?curid=727053" title="Modern Age (periodical)">
<text>Modern Age is an American conservative academic quarterly journal, founded in 1957 by Russell Kirk in close collaboration with Henry Regnery. Originally published independently in Chicago, in 1976 ownership was transferred to the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.

== History ==
With its founding Kirk hoped for &quot;a dignified forum for reflective, traditionalist conservatism&quot; and the magazine has remained one of the voices of intellectual, small-&quot;c&quot; conservatism to the present day.

Reflecting the ideals of its founder, in its politics it is traditionalist, localist, against most military interventions, not libertarian, anti-Straussian, and generally critical of neoconservatism. In its religious sympathies it adheres to orthodoxy, whether Roman Catholic, Jewish, Eastern Orthodox, or Protestant.

&quot;Modern Age&quot; has been described by the historian George H. Nash as &quot;the principal quarterly of the intellectual right.&quot;

Paul Gottfried, a professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, has said that &quot;&quot;Modern Age&quot; represents humanistic learning, reverence for the eternal, and the sense of human finiteness, values that (alas) have less and less to do with the academic presentation of the liberal arts.&quot;

Kirk edited the publication from 1957 to 1959. Eugene Davidson edited it from 1960 to 1969. David S. Collier was the quarterly&#x27;s third editor, from 1970 to 1983. &quot;Modern Age&quot; fourth editor was George A. Panichas who served from 1984 to 2007. The next editor was R. V. Young. Peter Lawler replaced Young in 2017. Lawler died later in 2017 and he was replaced by the current editor, Daniel McCarthy.

== Masthead ==
The journal&#x27;s Executive Editor is Mark Henrie, its Managing Editor is Arthur Bloom, and its Poetry Editor is James Matthew Wilson. Associate Editors include George W. Carey, Jude P. Dougherty, Jeffrey Hart, Marion Montgomery, Mordecai Roshwald, and Stephen J. Tonsor.

<doc id="727054" wikidata="Q1064897" url="?curid=727054" title="Play (Moby album)">
<text>Play is the fifth studio album by American electronic musician Moby. It was released on May 17, 1999, through Mute Records internationally and V2 Records in North America. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of Moby&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Animal Rights&quot; (1996), which deviated from his electronica style; Moby&#x27;s goal for &quot;Play&quot; was to return to electronica, blending downtempo with blues and roots music samples. Originally intended to be his final record, the album was recorded at Moby&#x27;s home studio in Manhattan.

While some of Moby&#x27;s earlier work had garnered critical and commercial success within the electronic dance music scene, &quot;Play&quot; was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. Initially issued to lackluster sales, it topped numerous album charts months after its release and was certified platinum in more than 20 countries. The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of its songs in films, television shows, and commercials. &quot;Play&quot; eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide, and became Moby&#x27;s breakthrough album.

In 2003 and 2012, &quot;Play&quot; was ranked number 341 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

==Background==
The second half of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of success in the techno scene. The release in 1996 of &quot;Animal Rights&quot;, a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the punk and metal records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him contemplating quitting music altogether. He explained: &quot;I was opening for Soundgarden and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night.&quot; However, positive reactions to &quot;Animal Rights&quot; from fellow artists such as Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby, Axl Rose, and Bono inspired Moby to continue producing music.

Moby started work on &quot;Play&quot; in August 1997 and put it on hold several times to complete touring obligations. At the time, he planned on making the album his last before ending his career. Recording sessions took place at Moby&#x27;s Mott Street home studio in Manhattan, New York. &quot;Play&quot; was delayed due to Moby&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the initial mix of the album that he had produced at home. A second mixing was completed at an outside studio before attempts at two other studios displayed similar results. After returning home and producing a mix by himself, Moby felt happy with it. Ultimately, he said that he &quot;wasted a lot of time and money&quot; on the previous unsatisfactory mixing sessions. Moby recalled a moment from March 1999, after &quot;Play&quot; had been mixed and sequenced, where he sat on the grass in Sara Delano Roosevelt Park: &quot;I was sitting by the little tire swings that had been chewed apart by the pit bulls [...] thinking to myself, &#x27;When this record comes out, it will be the end of my career. I should start thinking about what else I can do.&#x27;&quot; At that point, he considered returning to school to study architecture.

When Moby finished recording &quot;Play&quot;, there was no sign that the album would perform any differently than &quot;Animal Rights&quot;. While he remained signed to the label Mute, which issued his records in the United Kingdom, Elektra had dropped him from its roster of artists following the release of &quot;Animal Rights&quot;, leaving him without an outlet to release &quot;Play&quot; in the United States. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label, from Warner Bros. to Sony to RCA, and was rejected every time. After V2 finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to listen to it. Moby&#x27;s manager Eric Härle said that their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what &quot;Everything Is Wrong&quot; (1995), Moby&#x27;s biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.

==Music==
According to &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Will Hermes, &quot;Play&quot; was &quot;the high-water mark for populist electronica&quot; and a &quot;millennial roots and blues masterwork&quot;, while John Bush from AllMusic said it balanced Moby&#x27;s early electronica sound with the emergent breakbeat style of techno. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Jim DeRogatis noted its incorporation of such disparate musical influences as early blues, African-American folk music, gospel, hip hop, disco, and techno, &quot;all within the context of his own distinctly melodic ambient stylings.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; described &quot;Play&quot; as &quot;an organic downtempo masterpiece&quot; that fused live studio recordings and &quot;found sounds&quot;.

&quot;Play&quot; was particularly notable for its use of samples from field recordings collected by Alan Lomax and compiled on the 1993 box set &quot;Sounds of the South: A Musical Journey from the Georgia Sea Islands to the Mississippi Delta&quot;. Moby was introduced to the box set through a friend, Gregor Ehrlich, who loaned the CDs to him. The &quot;Play&quot; tracks &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Find My Baby&quot;, and &quot;Natural Blues&quot; were composed by Moby around vocal hooks sampled from songs by the folk singers Bessie Jones, Boy Blue, and Vera Hall, respectively, that were featured on the collection. Apart from the Lomax material, Moby also used samples of old gospel recordings on &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot; and &quot;Run On&quot;. In the liner notes for &quot;Play&quot;, Moby gave &quot;special thanks to the Lomaxes and all of the archivists and music historians whose field recordings made this record possible.&quot;

Elsewhere, &quot;Play&quot; is informed by more contemporary music styles. &quot;Bodyrock&quot;, which Moby called &quot;essentially a hip-hop song&quot;, features samples of rappers Spoonie Gee and the Treacherous Three. &quot;Machete&quot; was inspired by EBM acts such as Front 242 and Meat Beat Manifesto. &quot;Porcelain&quot; and &quot;South Side&quot; are both anchored by Moby&#x27;s own lead vocals, and are among several songs on the album that spotlight his trademark &quot;evocative, melancholy&quot; techno sound, according to Bush. The remaining tracks are primarily instrumental in nature, and Moby cited these as his favorites from &quot;Play&quot;. The latter half of the album is mostly composed of these instrumentals, which are more downcast in mood and less driven by samples. Moby noted that he intentionally sequenced the album such that &quot;it starts off energetic and then by the end dissolves into an opiated haze.&quot;

== Controversy ==
In the last piece My Weakness, a polyphonic song from Tiga Island, in New-Caledonia, can be heard. This song, &quot;Nyinewaco&quot;, tells one of the founding myths of the island, about drinking water. Very surprised of the presence of this song in Moby’s music, Tiga islanders asked help to SACENC (caledonian SACEM), in order to meet Moby, and introduce themself as the owners of the music/story.

They found out that this traditional music has been used in many films, documentaries, advertisements. Moby told in an interview in Rolling Stones: &quot;&quot;My Weakness&quot; is such a strange piece of music. There’s no drums and it’s this odd African choir loop — I sampled it 12 years ago, I don’t remember what it’s from.&quot; It is actually an ethnomusicological recording, made in Tiga island in 1986, for the inauguration of a temple.

But, because of lack of funds and legal support, the people renounced to sue Moby.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Play&quot; was released on May 17, 1999, by Mute, and on June 1, 1999, by V2. On its release, it underperformed commercially. The record debuted at number 33 on the UK Albums Chart, but thereafter descended the chart. Moby recounted that the first show he played in support of &quot;Play&quot;, at the basement of the Virgin Megastore in Union Square, was attended by only around 40 people. Further damaging the album&#x27;s commercial prospects, &quot;Play&quot;″s songs received little airplay from radio stations or television networks such as MTV.

Moby and his management, however, soon found another approach to increasing public exposure of &quot;Play&quot;, by way of licensing its songs for use in films, television shows, and commercials. According to Moby, their goal &quot;was simply to get people to hear the music&quot;. &quot;Most of the licenses weren&#x27;t particularly lucrative,&quot; he noted, &quot;but they enabled people to hear the music because otherwise the record wasn&#x27;t being heard.&quot; Eric Härle clarified that although many people believed the songs were pitched for advertisements as part of the marketing campaign for an album that did not fit with mainstream radio, the licensing actually came about as a result of agencies asking for permission to use the music as soundbeds; he attributed the music&#x27;s popularity to its evocative and emotional nature. Despite the heavy licensing, each request was nevertheless carefully vetted and more requests were turned down than accepted. Moby&#x27;s manager Barry Taylor recalled that after the producers of a British television program sent a fax requesting for permission to use &quot;7&quot;, the only track from &quot;Play&quot; that had yet to be licensed, &quot;we celebrated.&quot;

The licensing approach proved successful in increasing &quot;Play&quot;″s visibility, and subsequently radio and MTV airplay for the album&#x27;s songs began to pick up. The album re-entered the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart in January 2000, slowly climbing positions and finally reaching number one three months later, spending five weeks at the top. It remained on the chart for the remainder of 2000, and in the UK was the fifth best-selling album, as well as the best-selling independent album, of that year. By October 2000, &quot;Play&quot; had attained platinum certifications in 17 countries and topped the charts in seven. While it only reached number 38 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, the album sold over two million copies in the US, enjoying steady sales for months and constant popularity. &quot;Play&quot; has been certified platinum in more than 20 countries, and with over 12 million copies sold worldwide, it is the biggest-selling electronica album of all time.

Eight singles were released from &quot;Play&quot;: &quot;Honey&quot; on August 24, 1998, &quot;Run On&quot; on April 26, 1999, &quot;Bodyrock&quot; on July 12, 1999, &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot; on October 11, 1999, &quot;Natural Blues&quot; on March 6, 2000, &quot;Porcelain&quot; on April 25, 2000, &quot;South Side&quot; on October 10, 2000, and &quot;Find My Baby&quot; on October 16, 2000. The first six all reached the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. &quot;South Side&quot;, which for its single release was remixed to include additional vocals from No Doubt&#x27;s lead singer Gwen Stefani, became Moby&#x27;s first single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at number 14. Numerous music videos were commissioned for the album&#x27;s singles, directed by filmmakers such as Jonas Åkerlund (&quot;Porcelain&quot;), Roman Coppola (&quot;Honey&quot;), Joseph Kahn (&quot;South Side&quot;), and David LaChapelle (&quot;Natural Blues&quot;).

In October 2000, the compilation album &quot;&quot; was released, containing tracks released as B-sides on the singles from &quot;Play&quot;. A DVD titled &quot;Play: The DVD&quot; was released in July 2001. It features most of the music videos for &quot;Play&quot;″s singles; an 88-minute megamix of various remixes of the album&#x27;s songs, accompanied by animated visuals; a performance by Moby on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;; a compilation of footage shot by Moby on tour titled &quot;Give an Idiot a Camcorder&quot;; an interactive component that allows users to remix &quot;Bodyrock&quot; and &quot;Natural Blues&quot;; and a bonus CD containing the aforementioned megamix. &quot;Play: The DVD&quot; was nominated for Best Long Form Music Video at the 44th Grammy Awards.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Play&quot; received widespread critical acclaim upon release. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has a score of 84 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1999, Robert Christgau said the album&#x27;s sampled recordings would not &quot;shout anywhere near as loud and clear&quot; without Moby&#x27;s &quot;ministrations—his grooves, his pacing, his textures, his harmonies, sometimes his tunes, and mostly his grooves, which honor not just dance music but the entire rock tradition it&#x27;s part of.&quot; He deemed the album &quot;no more focused&quot; than Moby&#x27;s previous &quot;brilliant messes&quot; but still &quot;one of those records whose drive to beauty should move anybody who just likes, well, music itself.&quot; In his review for AllMusic, John Bush stated that &quot;Play&quot; showed Moby &quot;balancing his sublime early sound with the breakbeat techno evolution of the &#x27;90s.&quot; Barry Walters from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;the ebb and flow of eighteen concise, contrasting cuts writes a story about Moby&#x27;s beautifully conflicted interior world while giving the outside planet beats and tunes on which to groove.&quot; David Browne, writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, felt that despite some needed editing, Moby&#x27;s graceful soundscapes filter out the original recordings&#x27; antiquated sound and &quot;make the singers&#x27; heartache and hope seem fresh again.&quot; In a more critical appraisal, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Brent DiCrescenzo believed the &quot;raw magnetism&quot; of the sampled recordings was lost to &quot;innate digital recording techniques&quot;, resulting in music that was &quot;fun and functional, yet disposable.&quot;
At the end of 1999, &quot;Play&quot; was voted the year&#x27;s best album in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s supervisor, ranked it second best on his own year-end list. The following year, the album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Performance at the 42nd Grammy Awards. Since then, it has been named one of the greatest albums of all time. NPR named &quot;Play&quot; one of the 300 most important American records of the 20th century, as determined by the network&#x27;s news and cultural programming staff, prominent critics, and scholars. It was ranked number 341 on the 2003 and 2012 editions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2005, a panel of recording industry pundits assembled by Channel 4 voted &quot;Play&quot; the 63rd-best album ever. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Legacy==
According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;&quot;Play&quot; wasn&#x27;t the first album to make a rock star out of an insular techno nerdnik, but it was the first to make one a pop sensation. [...] &quot;Play&quot; made postmodernism cuddly, slowly but surely striking a chord with critics and record-buyers alike.&quot; &quot;Wired&quot; said that the songs on &quot;Play&quot;—which became the first album ever to have all of its tracks licensed for use in films, television shows, or commercials—&quot;have been sold hundreds of times [...] a licensing venture so staggeringly lucrative that the album was a financial success months before it reached its multi-platinum sales total.&quot; In a retrospective piece for &quot;Wondering Sound&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote:

English singer-songwriter Adele cited &quot;Play&quot; as an influence on her 2015 album &quot;25&quot;, saying: &quot;There&#x27;s something that I find really holy about that &quot;Play&quot; album... The way it makes me feel. Even though there&#x27;s nothing holy or preachy about it. There&#x27;s just something about it—maybe the gospel samples. But it makes me feel alive, that album, still. And I remember my mum having that record.&quot;

<text>Houari Boumediene International Airport () , also known as Algiers Airport or Algiers International Airport, is the main international airport serving Algiers, the capital of Algeria. It is located east southeast of the city.

The airport is named after Houari Boumediene (1932–1978), a former president of Algeria. Dar El Beïda, the area where the airport is located, was known as &quot;Maison Blanche&quot; (&#x27;White House&#x27;), and the airport is called Maison Blanche Airport in much of the literature about the Algerian War of Independence. The SGSIA (), more commonly known as &#x27;Airport of Algiers&#x27;, is a public company established on 1 November 2006 to manage and operate the airport. The SGSIA has 2,100 employees.

==History==
The airport was created in 1924 and named Maison Blanche Airport. During World War II, Maison Blanche was a primary objective of the Allied Operation Torch Eastern Task Force on 8 November 1942, and was seized by a combination of United States Army units, British Commandos and elements of a British Infantry Division. Opposition by Vichy French forces who defended the airport ended that same day, as orders from Admiral Darlan in Algiers were issued to cease all hostilities in North Africa.

Hawker Hurricane Aircraft of No. 43 Squadron RAF, under the Command of Squadron Leader Michael Rook, landed at Maison Blanche shortly after 11.00 Hrs on 8 November, and began offensive patrols the next day. 43 Sqn remained at Maison Blanche until 13 March 1943, when the unit was deployed to Jemmapes, Constantine.

Once in Allied hands, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command as a major transshipment hub for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel. It functioned as a stopover en route to Tafarquay Airport, near Oran, or to Tunis Airport, Tunisia, on the North African Cairo-Dakar transport route. It also flew personnel and cargo to Marseille, Milan, Naples and Palermo. In addition, Twelfth Air Force A3 SECTION, under the command of Lt. Col Carter E. Duncan 1943/44, used the airport as a command and control facility, headquartering its XII Bomber Command; XXII Tactical Air Command, and the 51st Troop Carrier Wing to direct combat and support missions during the North African Campaign against the German Afrika Korps. Known Allied air force combat units assigned to the airfield were:

* No. 43 Squadron RAF 323 Wing RAF, 8 November 1942 -13 March 1943 Hawker Hurricane
* 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 23 November 1942 – 28 March 1943
* 63d Fighter Wing, May–August 1943
* 97th Bombardment Group, 13–22 November 1942, B-17 Flying Fortress
* 301st Bombardment Group, 5–16 December 1942, B-17 Flying Fortress
* 319th Bombardment Group, 24–12 November 1942, B-26 Marauder
* 14th Fighter Group, 18–22 November 1942, P-38 Lightning
* 350th Fighter Group, May–July 1943, P-38 Lightning
* 3d Reconnaissance Group, 25 December 1942 – 13 June 1943, (various photo reconnaissance aircraft)

<text>Hydrocharitaceae is a flowering plant family including 16 known genera with a total of ca 135 known species (Christenhusz &amp; Byng 2016), that including a number of species of aquatic plant, for instance the tape-grasses, the well known Canadian waterweed, and frogbit.

The family includes both freshwater and marine aquatics. They are found throughout the world in a wide variety of habitats, but are primarily tropical.

== Description ==
The species are annual or perennial, with a creeping monopodial rhizome with the leaves arranged in two vertical rows, or an erect main shoot with roots at the base and spirally arranged or whorled leaves. The leaves are simple and usually found submerged, though they may be found floating or partially . As with many aquatics they can be quite variable in shape – from linear to orbicular, with or without a petiole, and with or without a sheathing base.

The flowers are arranged in a forked, spathe-like bract or between two opposite bracts. They are usually irregular, though in some case they may be slightly irregular, and either bisexual or unisexual. The perianth segments are in 1 or 2 series of 2–3 free segments; the inner series when present are usually showy and petal-like. Stamens 1–numerous, in 1 or more series; the inner ones sometimes sterile. pollen grains are globular and free but in the marine genera (&quot;Thalassia&quot; and &quot;Halophila&quot;) – the pollen grains are carried in chains, like strings of beads. The ovary is inferior with 2–15 united carpels containing a single locule with numerous ovules on parietal placentas which either protrude nearly to the centre of the ovary or are incompletely developed. Fruits are globular to linear, dry or pulpy, dehiscent or more usually indehiscent and opening by decay of the pericarp. Seeds are normally numerous with straight embryos and no endosperm.

Pollination can be extremely specialised.

The most recent phylogenetic treatment of the family recognizes four subfamilies.
* Subfamily Anacharioideae (&quot;Appertiella&quot;, &quot;Blyxa&quot;, &quot;Egeria&quot;, &quot;Elodea&quot;, &quot;Lagarosiphon&quot; and &quot;Ottelia&quot;) 
* Subfamily Hydrilloideae (&quot;Enhalus&quot;, &quot;Halophila&quot;, &quot;Hydrilla&quot;, &quot;Maidenia&quot;, &quot;Najas&quot;, &quot;Nechamandra&quot;, &quot;Thalassia&quot; and &quot;Vallisneria&quot;).
* Subfamily Hydrocharitoideae (&quot;Hydrocharis&quot;, &quot;Limnobium&quot;)
* Subfamily Stratiotoideae (&quot;Stratiotes&quot;)


== Uses ==
Some species have become established ornamental plants, and subsequently serious weeds in the wild (especially &quot;Egeria&quot;, &quot;Elodea&quot; and &quot;Hydrilla&quot;).

<text>Artemisinin () and its semisynthetic derivatives are a group of drugs used in the treatment of malaria due to &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. It was discovered in 1972 by Tu Youyou, who shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discovery. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now standard treatment worldwide for &quot;P. falciparum&quot; malaria as well as malaria due to other species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot;. Artemisinin is extracted from the plant &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; (sweet wormwood), a herb employed in Chinese traditional medicine. A precursor compound can be produced using a genetically engineered yeast, which is much more efficient than using the plant.

Artemisinin and its derivatives are all sesquiterpene lactones containing an unusual peroxide bridge. This endoperoxide 1,2,4-trioxane ring is responsible for their antimalarial properties. Few other natural compounds with such a peroxide bridge are known.

Artemisinin and its derivatives have been used for the treatment of malarial and parasitic worm (helminth) infections. Advantages of such treatments over other anti-parasitics include faster parasite elimination and broader efficacy across the parasite life-cycle; disadvantages include their low bioavailability, poor pharmacokinetic properties, and high cost. Moreover, use of the drug by itself as a monotherapy is explicitly discouraged by the World Health Organization, as there have been signs that malarial parasites are developing resistance to the drug. Combination therapies, featuring artemisinin or its derivatives alongside some other antimalarial drug, constitute the contemporary standard-of-care treatment regimen for malaria.

==Medical use==
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin or one of its derivatives ― typically in combination with a longer-lasting partner drug ― as frontline therapy for all cases of malaria. For uncomplicated malaria, the WHO recommends three days of oral treatment with any of five artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs): artemether/lumefantrine, artesunate/amodiaquine (ASAQ), artesunate/mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine, or artesunate/sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. In each of these combinations, the artemisinin derivative rapidly kills the parasites, but is itself rapidly cleared from the body. The longer-lived partner drug kills the remaining parasites and provides some lingering protection from reinfection.

For severe malaria, the WHO recommends intravenous or intramuscular treatment with the artemisinin derivative artesunate for at least 24 hours. Artesunate treatment is continued until the treated person is well enough to take oral medication. They are then given a three-day course of an ACT, for uncomplicated malaria. Where artesunate is not available, the WHO recommends intramuscular injection of the less potent artemisinin derivative artemether. For children less than six years old, if injected artesunate is not available the WHO recommends rectal administration of artesunate, followed by referral to a facility with the resources for further care.

Artemisinins are not used for malaria prevention because of the extremely short activity (half-life) of the drug. To be effective, it would have to be administered multiple times each day.

===Contraindications===
The WHO recommends avoiding ACT for women in their first trimester of pregnancy due to a lack of research on artemisinin&#x27;s safety in early pregnancy. Instead the WHO recommends a seven-day course of clindamycin and quinine. For pregnant women in their second or third trimesters, the WHO recommends a normal treatment course with an ACT. For some other groups, certain ACTs are avoided due to side effects of the partner drug: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is avoided during the first few weeks of life as it interferes with the action of bilirubin and can worsen neonatal jaundice. In HIV-positive people, the combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, zidovudine-containing antiretroviral treatments, and ASAQ is associated with neutropenia. The combination of the HIV drug efavirenz and ASAQ is associated with liver toxicity.

==Adverse effects==
Artemisinins are generally well tolerated at the doses used to treat malaria. The side effects from the artemisinin class of medications are similar to the symptoms of malaria: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and dizziness. Mild blood abnormalities have also been noted. A rare but serious adverse effect is allergic reaction. One case of significant liver inflammation has been reported in association with prolonged use of a relatively high-dose of artemisinin for an unclear reason (the patient did not have malaria). The drugs used in combination therapies can contribute to the adverse effects experienced by those undergoing treatment. Adverse effects in patients with acute &quot;P. falciparum&quot; malaria treated with artemisinin derivatives tend to be higher.

==Chemistry==
An unusual component of the artemisinin molecules is an endoperoxide 1,2,4-trioxane ring. This is the main antimalarial centre of the molecule. Modifications at carbon 10 (C10) position give rise to a variety of derivatives which are more powerful than the original compound. Because the physical properties of artemisinin itself, such as poor bioavailability, limit its effectiveness, semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin have been developed. Derivatives of dihydroartemisinin were made since 1976. Artesunate, arteether and artemether were first synthesized in 1986. Many derivatives have been produced of which artelinic acid, artemotil, artemisone, SM735, SM905, SM933, SM934, and SM1044 are among the most powerful compounds. There are also simplified analogs in preclinical development. Over 120 other derivatives have been prepared, but clinical testing has not been possible due to lack of financial support.

Artemisinin is poorly soluble in oils and water. Therefore, it is typically administered via the digestive tract, either by oral or rectal administration. Artesunate however can be administered via the intravenous and intramuscular, as well as the oral and rectal routes. A synthetic compound with a similar trioxolane structure (a ring containing three oxygen atoms) named RBx-11160 showed promise in &quot;in vitro&quot; testing. Phase II testing in patients with malaria was not as successful as hoped, but the manufacturer decided to start Phase III testing anyway.

==Mechanism of action==
As of 2018, the exact mechanism of action of artemisinins has not been fully elucidated. Artemisinin itself is a prodrug of the biologically active dihydroartemisinin. This metabolite undergoes cleavage of its endoperoxide ring inside the erythrocytes. As the drug molecules come in contact with the haem (associated with the hemoglobin of the red blood cells), the iron(II) oxide breaks the endoperoxide ring. This process produces free radicals that in turn damage susceptible proteins, resulting in the death of the parasite. In 2016 artemisinin was shown to bind to a large number of targets suggesting that it acts in a promiscuous manner. Artemisinin&#x27;s endoperoxide moiety is however less sensitive to free iron(II) oxide, and therefore more active in the intraerythrocytic stages of &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. In contrast, clinical practice shows that unlike other antimalarials, artemisinin is active during all life cycle stages of the parasite.

==Resistance==
Clinical evidence for artemisinin drug resistance in southeast Asia was first reported in 2008, and was subsequently confirmed by a detailed study from western Cambodia. Resistance in neighbouring Thailand was reported in 2012, and in northern Cambodia, Vietnam and eastern Myanmar in 2014. Emerging resistance was reported in southern Laos, central Myanmar and northeastern Cambodia in 2014. The parasite&#x27;s kelch gene on chromosome 13 appears to be a reliable molecular marker for clinical resistance in Southeast Asia.

In 2011, the WHO stated that resistance to the most effective antimalarial drug, artemisinin, could unravel national Indian malaria control programs, which have achieved significant progress in the last decade. WHO advocates the rational use of antimalarial drugs and acknowledges the crucial role of community health workers in reducing malaria in the region.

Artemisinins can be used alone, but this leads to a high rate of return of parasites and other drugs are required to clear the body of all parasites and prevent a recurrence. The WHO is pressuring manufacturers to stop making the uncompounded drug available to the medical community at large, aware of the catastrophe that would result if the malaria parasite developed resistance to artemisinins.

Two main mechanisms of resistance drive &quot;Plasmodium&quot; resistance to antimalarial drugs. The first one is an efflux of the drug away from its action site due to mutations in different transporter genes (like &quot;pfcrt&quot; in chloroquine resistance) or an increased number of the gene copies (like pfmdr1 copy number in mefloquine resistance). The second is a change in the parasite target due to mutations in corresponding genes (like, at the cytosol level, &quot;dhfr&quot; and &quot;dhps&quot; in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance or, at the mitochondrion level, &quot;cytochrome b&quot; in atovaquone resistance). Resistance of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; to the new artemisinin compounds involves a novel mechanism corresponding to a quiescence phenomenon.

 future resistance research will make use of transgenic mice to discover relevant molecular markers.

==Synthesis==
===Biosynthesis in &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;===
The biosynthesis of artemisinin is believed to involve the mevalonate pathway (MVA) and the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FDP). It is not clear whether the non-mevalonate pathway can also contribute 5-carbon precursors (IPP or DMAPP), as occurs in other sesquiterpene biosynthetic systems. The routes from artemisinic alcohol to artemisinin remain controversial, and they differ mainly in when the reduction step takes place. Both routes suggested dihydroartemisinic acid as the final precursor to artemisinin. Dihydroartemisinic acid then undergoes photo-oxidation to produce dihydroartemisinic acid hydroperoxide. Ring expansion by the cleavage of hydroperoxide and a second oxygen-mediated hydroperoxidation finish the biosynthesis of artemisinin.
===Chemical synthesis===
The total synthesis of artemisinin has been performed from available organic starting materials, using basic organic reagents, many times. The first two total syntheses were a stereoselective synthesis by Schmid and Hofheinz at Hoffmann-La Roche in Basel starting from (−)-isopulegol (13 steps, ~5% overall yield), and a concurrent synthesis by Zhou and coworkers at the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry from (&quot;R&quot;)-(+)-citronellal (20 steps, ~0.3% overall yield). Key steps of the Schmid–Hofheinz approach included an initial Ohrloff stereoselective hydroboration/oxidation to establish the &quot;off-ring&quot; methyl stereocenter on the propene side chain; two sequential lithium-reagent mediated alkylations that introduced all needed carbon atoms and that were, together highly diastereoselective; and further reduction, oxidation, and desilylation steps performed on this mono-carbocyclic intermediate, including a final singlet oxygen-utilizing photooxygenation and ene reaction, which, after acidic workup closed the three remaining oxacyclic rings of the desired product, artemisinin, in a single step.(In essence, the final oxidative ring-closing operation in these syntheses accomplishes the closing three biosynthetic steps shown above.)

A wide variety of further routes continue to be explored, from early days until today, including total synthesis routes from (&quot;R&quot;)-(+)-pulegone, isomenthene, and even 2-cyclohexen-1-one, as well as routes better described as partial or semisyntheses from a more plentiful biosynthetic precursor, artemisinic acid—in the latter case, including some very short and very high yielding biomimetic synthesis examples (of Roth and Acton, and Haynes et al., 3 steps, 30% yield), which again feature the singlet oxygen ene chemistry.

===Synthesis in engineered organisms===
The partnership to develop semisynthetic artemisinin was led by PATH&#x27;s Drug Development program (through an affiliation with OneWorld Health), with funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The project began in 2004, and initial project partners included the University of California, Berkeley (which provided the technology on which the project was based – a process that genetically altered yeast to produce artemisinic acid) and Amyris (a biotechnology firm in California, which refined the process to enable large-scale production and developed scalable processes for transfer to an industrial partner).

In 2006, a team from UC Berkeley reported they had engineered &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; yeast to produce a small amount of the precursor artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid can then be transported out, purified and chemically converted into artemisinin that they claim will cost roughly US$0.25 per dose. In this effort of synthetic biology, a modified mevalonate pathway was used, and the yeast cells were engineered to express the enzyme amorphadiene synthase and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1), both from &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;. A three-step oxidation of amorpha-4,11-diene gives the resulting artemisinic acid.

The UC Berkeley method was augmented using technology from various other organizations. The final successful technology is based on inventions licensed from UC Berkeley and the National Research Council (NRC) Plant Biotechnology Institute of Canada.

Commercial production of semisynthetic artemisinin is now underway at Sanofi&#x27;s site in Garessio, Italy. This second source of artemisinin is poised to enable a more stable flow of key antimalarial treatments to those who need them most. The production goal is set at 35 tonnes for 2013. It is expected to increase to 50–60 tons per year in 2014, supplying approximately one-third of the global annual need for artemisinin.

In 2013, WHO&#x27;s Prequalification of Medicines Programme announced the acceptability of semisynthetic artemisinin for use in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients submitted to WHO for prequalification, or that have already been qualified by WHO. Sanofi&#x27;s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) produced from semisynthetic artemisinin (artesunate) was also prequalified by WHO on May 8, 2013, making it the first semisynthetic artemisinin derivative prequalified.

In 2010, a team from Wageningen University and Research reported they had engineered a close relative of tobacco, &quot;Nicotiana benthamiana&quot;, that can also produce the precursor, artemisinic acid.

==Production and price==
China and Vietnam provide 70% and East Africa 20% of the raw plant material. Seedlings are grown in nurseries and then transplanted into fields. It takes about 8 months for them to reach full size. The plants are harvested, the leaves are dried and sent to facilities where the artemisinin is extracted using a solvent, typically hexane. Alternative extraction methods have been proposed. The market price for artemisinin has fluctuated widely, between US$120 and $1,200 per kilogram from 2005 to 2008.

The Chinese company Artepharm created a combination artemisinin and piperaquine drug marketed as Artequick. In addition to clinical research performed in China and southeast Asia, Artequick was used in large-scale malaria eradication efforts in the Comoros. Those efforts, conducted in 2007, 2012, and 2013–14, produced a 95–97% reduction in the number of malaria cases in the Comoros.

After negotiation with the WHO, Novartis and Sanofi provide ACT drugs at cost on a nonprofit basis; however, these drugs are still more expensive than other malaria treatments. Artesunate injection for severe malaria treatment is made by the Guilin Pharmaceutical factory in China where production has received WHO prequalification. High-yield varieties of &quot;Artemisia&quot; are being produced by the Centre for Novel Agricultural Products at the University of York using molecular breeding techniques.

Using seed supplied by Action for Natural Medicine (ANAMED), the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) has developed a hybrid, dubbed A3, which can grow to a height of 3 meters and produce 20 times more artemisinin than wild varieties. In northwestern Mozambique, ICRAF is working together with a medical organization, Médecins Sans Frontières, ANAMED and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to train farmers on how to grow the shrub from cuttings, and to harvest and dry the leaves to make artemisia tea. However, the WHO does not recommend the use of &quot;A. annua&quot; plant materials, including tea, for the prevention and treatment of malaria.

In 2013, Sanofi announced the launch of a production facility in Garessio, Italy, to manufacture the antiplasmodial drug on a large scale. The partnership to create a new pharmaceutical manufacturing process was led by PATH&#x27;s Drug Development program (through an affiliation with OneWorld Health), with funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and based on a modified biosynthetic process for artemisinic acid, initially designed by Jay Keasling at UC Berkeley and optimized by Amyris. The reaction is followed by a photochemical process creating singlet oxygen to obtain the end product. Sanofi expects to produce 25 tons of artemisinin in 2013, ramping up the production to 55–60 tonnes in 2014. The price per kilogram will be US$350–400, roughly the same as the botanical source. Despite concerns that this equivalent source would lead to the demise of companies, which produce this substance conventionally through extraction of &quot;A. annua&quot; biomass, an increased supply of this drug will likely produce lower prices and therefore increase the availability for ACT treatment. In 2014, Sanofi announced the release of the first batch of semisynthetic artemisinin. 1.7 million doses of Sanofi&#x27;s ASAQ, a fixed-dose artemisinin-based combination therapy will be shipped to half a dozen African countries over the next few months.

A 2016 systematic review of four studies from East Africa concluded that subsidizing ACT in the private retail sector in combination with training and marketing has led to the increased availability of ACT in stores, increased use of ACT for febrile children under five years of age, and decrease in the use of older, less effective antimalarials among children under five years of age. The underlying studies did not determine if the children had malaria nor determine if there were health benefits.

==Metabolism==
After ingestion or injection, artemisinin and its derivatives (arteether, artemether, and artesunate) are all rapidly converted in the bloodstream to dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which has 5–10 times greater antimalarial potency than artemisinin. DHA is eventually converted in the liver into metabolites such as deoxyartemisinin, deoxydihydroartemisinin, and 9,10-dihydrodeoxyartemisinin. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzymes CYP2A6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, which belong to the cytochrome P450 group present in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These metabolites lack antimalarial properties due to the loss of the endoperoxide group (deoxyartemisinin however has anti-inflammatory and antiulcer properties.) All these metabolites undergo glucuronidation, after which they are excreted through the urine or feces. Glucuronosyltransferases, in particular UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, are responsible for this process. DHA is also removed through bile as minor glucuronides. Due to their rapid metabolism, artemisinin and its derivatives are relatively safe drugs with a relatively high therapeutic index.

==History==
===Etymology===
Artemisinin is an antimalarial lactone derived from &quot;qinghao&quot; (, &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; or sweet wormwood). In 1596, Li Shizhen recommended tea made from &quot;qinghao&quot; specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot;. The genus name is derived from the Greek goddess Artemis and, more specifically, may have been named after Queen Artemisia II of Caria, a botanist and medical researcher in the fourth century BC.

===Discovery===
&quot;Artemisia annua&quot; a common herb found in many parts of the world. In 1967, a plant screening research program, under a secret military program code-named &quot;Project 523&quot;, was set up by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army to find an adequate treatment for malaria; the program and early clinical work were ordered by Mao Zedong at the request of North Vietnamese leaders to provide assistance for their malaria-ridden army. In the course of this research in 1972, Tu Youyou discovered artemisinin in the leaves of &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;.

Named &quot;qinghaosu&quot; (), it was one of many candidates tested as possible treatments for malaria by Chinese scientists, from a list of nearly 2,000 traditional Chinese medicines. Tu Youyou also discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant. Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source &quot;The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments&quot; written in 340 CE by Ge Hong saying that this herb should be steeped in cold water. This book contained the useful reference to the herb: &quot;A handful of &quot;qinghao&quot; immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all.&quot;

Tu&#x27;s team subsequently isolated an extract. Results were published in the &quot;Chinese Medical Journal&quot; in 1979. The extracted substance, once subject to purification, proved to be a useful starting point to obtain purified artemisinin. A 2012 review reported that artemisinin-based therapies were the most effective drugs for treatment of malaria at that time; it was also reported to clear malaria parasites from patients&#x27; bodies faster than other drugs. In addition to artemisinin, Project 523 developed a number of products that can be used in combination with artemisinin, including lumefantrine, piperaquine, and pyronaridine.

In the late 1990s, Novartis filed a new Chinese patent for a combination treatment with artemether/lumefantrine, providing the first artemisinin-based combination therapies (Coartem) at reduced prices to the WHO. In 2006, after artemisinin had become the treatment of choice for malaria, the WHO called for an immediate halt to single-drug artemisinin preparations in favor of combinations of artemisinin with another malaria drug, to reduce the risk of parasites developing resistance.

In 2011, Tu Youyou was awarded the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for her role in the discovery and development of artemisinin. On October 5, 2015, she was awarded half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering artemisinin, &quot;a drug that has significantly reduced the mortality rates for patients suffering from malaria&quot;. The other half of the prize was awarded jointly to William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura for discovering avermectin, &quot;the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases&quot;.

==Research==
===New artemisinin-based combination therapies===
The WHO notes four additional ACTs that are in preliminary clinical trials or regionally used for which there is no evidence to recommend widespread use: artesunate/pyronaridine, arterolane-piperaquine, artemisinin-piperaquine base, and artemisinin/naphthoquine.

===Helminthiasis===
A serendipitous discovery was made in China in the early 1980s while searching for novel anthelmintics for schistosomiasis that artemisinin was effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent antihelmintics. Artemisinins were later found to possess a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of trematodes, including &quot;Schistosoma japonicum&quot;, &quot;S. mansoni&quot;, &quot;S. haematobium&quot;, &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot;, &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;, and &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot;.

===Cancer===
Artemisinin and its derivatives are under laboratory research for their potential anti-cancer effects. As of 2018, only preliminary clinical research had been conducted using artemisininin derivatives in various cancers, with no approved clinical applications.

===Autoimmune disease===
Artemisinin derivatives may suppress immune reactions, such as inflammation. One derivative, SM934, was approved in 2015 by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a clinical trial as a drug for systemic lupus erythematosus.

===Polycystic ovary syndrome===

Artemisinin may be potentially useful for treating symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

<text>Teany, sometimes stylized as TeaNY or teany, was a tea café, restaurant and beverage distributor in New York City founded by electronic musician Moby with ex-girlfriend, Kelly Tisdale. The Teany Café opened in 2002 in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York at 90 Rivington Street and closed in 2015.

The cafe was known for its assortment of teas, vegan options, and its decor, most of which was designed by Moby himself. Teany also featured, during the first few months of its opening, the raw food specialty, Go-Go Greens, by vegan celebrity chef, Elijah Joy. Teany made a brief appearance in Moby&#x27;s 18 B Sides + DVD. In January 2006, Teany was refocused as more of a traditional tea house and offered less food. Kelly took on a larger role on the business side of Teany with Moby taking a smaller one.

On June 19, 2009 a fire caused minimal damage to the tea house. Nobody was hurt and, according to Moby&#x27;s online journal, it was Kelly&#x27;s decision whether the cafe was going to be rebuilt or not. The tea house reopened in May 2010, briefly rebranded as Teany-ssimo, later reverting to the original name. Teany was shuttered for good in December 2015.

The beverage company distributed tea–juice mixtures to a number of shops around New York and New Jersey. In 2005, UK-based suburb secured an exclusive deal to sell Teany beverages and tea at its stores in Manchester and London.

The company allowed liberal pronunciation of the brand name, proclaiming, “you can pronounce it however you like. tea-knee. tee-nee. tea-enn-why,” and going on to state that Moby and Kelly themselves pronounce it “teenie”.

<doc id="727075" wikidata="Q5157252" url="?curid=727075" title="Compulsory purchase order">
<text>A compulsory purchase order (CPO; , ) is a legal function in the United Kingdom and Ireland that allows certain bodies to obtain land or property without the consent of the owner. It may be enforced if a proposed development is considered one for public betterment; for example, when building motorways where a landowner does not want to sell. Similarly, if town councils wish to develop a town centre, they may issue compulsory purchase orders. CPOs can also be used to acquire historic buildings in order to preserve them from neglect.

Compensation rights usually include the value of the property, costs of acquiring and moving to a new property, and sometimes additional payments. Costs of professional advice regarding compensation are usually reimbursed by the authority, so that people affected by a compulsory purchase order can seek advice from a solicitor and a surveyor and expect to be reimbursed.

== Ireland ==
In Ireland, CPOs became quite common in the early 21st century due to the massive road upgrade programme under the National Development Plan. CPOs are also used for railway or greenway projects. If one objects to the issuing of a CPO, one may appeal to the High Court. Compensation is available to ensure that the person is restored, as far as possible, to the financial position they were in before the land and property were compulsorily purchased.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, most orders are made as subordinate legislation under powers given to local authorities in existing legislation (e.g. an order for road works is made under the Highways Act 1980). Whilst the powers are strong, the authority must demonstrate that the taking of the land is necessary and there is a &quot;compelling case in the public interest&quot;. Owners or occupiers can challenge this, and their objection will be heard by an independent inspector.

<doc id="727085" wikidata="Q1228216" url="?curid=727085" title="Dirty Devil River">
<text>The Dirty Devil River is an tributary of the Colorado River, located in the U.S. state of Utah. It flows through southern Utah from the confluence of the Fremont River and Muddy Creek before emptying into the Colorado River at Lake Powell.

==Course==

The Dirty Devil River is formed in Wayne County near Hanksville at the confluence of the Fremont River and Muddy Creek. It flows generally southward through a canyon in Wayne and Garfield counties. Its lower flows through Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, where it finally disembogues into the Colorado River at a point that is now submerged beneath Lake Powell.

The canyon carved by the river is particularly isolated and seldom visited compared to other natural areas in the region. The average discharge is approximately 446 cubic feet per second.

==History==

The Dirty Devil River was named by the 1869 Powell Geographic Expedition led by John Wesley Powell, which explored much of the Colorado River and its tributaries. It was named for the extreme salinity and turbidity of the water near its mouth. Powell later contrasted it with a much cleaner stream in the Grand Canyon, which he named Bright Angel Creek.

The outlaw Butch Cassidy and his gang used tributary canyons of the Dirty Devil, such as Robbers Roost, as a in the 1890s.

==Geology==

The Dirty Devil River and its tributaries contribute approximately 150,000 tons of salt to the Colorado River each year, with the Muddy Creek tributary contributing an annual average of 86,000 tons by itself. The Fremont River tributary does not contribute significant amounts of salt. The United States Bureau of Reclamation drew up a plan to reduce the salinity of the Dirty Devil River by collecting salty spring water and using deep-well injection to dispose of it. The plan, finalized in 1987, has not been implemented due to its marginal cost effectiveness.

==Bridges==
The river is spanned by a bridge a few miles northwest of the Hite Crossing Bridge, a steel arch bridge over the Colorado River on State Route 95 near milepost 45 in Garfield County. It is also spanned by a bridge on State Route 24 a few miles NE of Hanksville, UT, just downstream from the confluence of Muddy Creek and the Fremont river.

<text>An azimuth thruster is a configuration of marine propellers placed in pods that can be rotated to any horizontal angle (azimuth), making a rudder redundant. These give ships better maneuverability than a fixed propeller and rudder system.

==Types of azimuth thrusters==
There are two major variants, based on the location of the motor:

# Mechanical transmission, which connects a motor inside the ship to the outboard unit by gearing. The motor may be diesel or diesel-electric. Depending on the shaft arrangement, mechanical azimuth thrusters are divided into L-drive and Z-drive. An L-drive thruster has a vertical input shaft and a horizontal output shaft with one right-angle gear. A Z-drive thruster has a horizontal input shaft, a vertical shaft in the rotating column and a horizontal output shaft, with two right-angle gears.
# Electrical transmission, more commonly called pods, where an electric motor is fitted in the pod itself, connected directly to the propeller without gears. The electricity is produced by an onboard engine, usually diesel or gas turbine. Invented in 1955 by Friedrich W. Pleuger and Friedrich Busmann (Pleuger Unterwasserpumpen GmbH), ABB Group&#x27;s Azipod was the first product using this technology. 

The most powerful podded thrusters in use are the four 21.5 MW Rolls-Royce Mermaid units fitted to .

Mechanical azimuth thrusters can be fixed installed, retractable or underwater-mountable. They may have fixed pitch propellers or controllable pitch propellers. Fixed installed thrusters are used for tugboats, ferries and supply-boats. Retractable thrusters are used as auxiliary propulsion for dynamically positioned vessels and take-home propulsion for military vessels. Underwater-mountable thrusters are used as dynamic positioning propulsion for very large vessels such as semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Primary advantages are maneuverability, electrical efficiency, better use of ship space, and lower maintenance costs. Ships with azimuth thrusters do not need tugboats to dock, though they may still require tugs to maneuver in difficult places.

The major disadvantage of azimuth drive systems is that a ship with azimuth drive maneuvers differently from one with a standard propeller and rudder configuration, necessitating specialized pilot training. Another disadvantage is they increase the draught of the ship.

==History==
English inventor Francis Ronalds described what he called a &quot;propelling rudder&quot; in 1859 that combined the propulsion and steering mechanisms of a boat in a single apparatus. The propeller was placed in a frame having an outer profile similar to a rudder and attached to a vertical shaft that allowed the device to rotate in plane while spin was transmitted to the propeller.

The modern azimuth thruster using the Z-drive transmission was invented in 1951 by Joseph Becker, the founder of Schottel in Germany, and marketed as the Ruderpropeller. Becker was awarded the 2004 Elmer A. Sperry Award for the invention. This kind of propulsion was first patented in 1955 by Pleuger.

In the late 1980s Wärtsilä Marine, Strömberg and the Finnish National Board of Navigation developed the Azipod thruster with the motor located in the pod itself.

<text>John Russell (21 December 1795 – 28 April 1883), was an English parson who served as vicar of Swimbridge from 1832 to 1872. An enthusiastic fox-hunter and dog breeder, Russell developed the Jack Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier, both of which are a variety of the Fox Terrier breed.

==Early life==
Russell was born on 21 December 1795 in Dartmouth, South Devon, the eldest son of John Russell and Nora Jewell. He lived at Sandhill House.

He was educated at Plympton Grammar School, Blundell&#x27;s School, Tiverton and Exeter College, Oxford.

==Sporting career==
According to local legend, it was at Exeter College where he spotted a little white terrier with dark tan spots over her eyes, ears and at the tip of her tail, who was owned by a local milkman in a nearby small hamlet, identified as either Elsfield or Marston. Russell bought the dog on the spot and this animal, called &quot;Trump&quot;, became the foundation of a line of fox hunting terriers that became known as Jack Russell Terriers. They were well-suited by the shortness and strength of their legs for digging out foxes which had &quot;gone to earth&quot; having been hunted over-ground by fox hounds.

Russell was a founding member of The Kennel Club. He helped to write the breed standard for the Fox Terrier (Smooth) and became a respected judge. He did not show his own fox terriers on the conformation bench, saying that the difference between his dogs and the conformation dogs could be likened to the difference between wild and cultivated flowers.

==Clerical career==
In 1832, Russell was appointed vicar of Swimbridge in North Devon, where the local public house was renamed the &quot;Jack Russell Inn&quot; and still stands today. He was also rector of Black Torrington in Devon. At Swimbridge, Russell enjoyed a hectic social life, with formal dining, charity fundraising, and an active career as a Freemason. The noted Historian WG Hoskins described Russell as &quot;futile&quot; 

==Marriage==
In 1826, at Swimbridge he married Penelope Incledon-Bury, third daughter and co-heiress of Vice-Admiral Richard Incledon-Bury (1757-1825), Royal Navy, lord of the manor of Colleton, Chulmleigh in Devon, who resided at Dennington, Swimbridge. Russell is said to have had expensive sporting habits both on and off the hunting-field, which drained the substantial resources of his heiress wife and left the estate of Colleton in poor condition.

==Death and burial==
Russell died on 28 April 1883 at Black Torrington Receptory, and was buried in the churchyard of St. James&#x27;s Church, Swimbridge, where he had served as vicar for 40 years.

<text>Patrick Watson (December 23, 1929July 4, 2022) was a Canadian broadcaster, television and radio interviewer and host, author, commentator, actor, television writer, producer, and director for five decades.

==Early life==
Born on December 23, 1929, in Toronto, Watson attended the University of Toronto and graduated with an MA. He began working on his doctorate at the University of Michigan, but withdrew in 1955 to focus on working for CBC Television.

==Career==
Watson&#x27;s first broadcast, in 1943, was as a radio actor in the CBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s dramatic series &quot;The Kootenay Kid&quot;. He first achieved national fame (and in some quarters, notoriety) as the co-producer and, with Laurier LaPierre, on-camera co-host of the CBC Television current affairs program &quot;This Hour Has Seven Days&quot; in the mid-1960s. Watson went on to write, edit, and/or produce &quot;The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau&quot;, &quot;Witness to Yesterday&quot;, and &quot;Titans&quot;. He travelled to the United States for a short stint as an anchor and principal interviewer of &quot;The 51st State&quot;, a local news program televised in 1972–1973 on WNET in New York City. Watson also hosted the CBC&#x27;s business program &quot;Venture&quot; when it was first launched in 1985.

In 1983 he created and performed, solo, a stage version of the Old Testament&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Job&quot;, at first at the Nathan Cohen Studio in Toronto, directed by John McGreevey, and then at the National Arts Centre Theatre in Ottawa. For CBC he hosted and/or produced shows such as &quot;The Watson Report&quot;, &quot;The Canadian Establishment&quot; and &quot;The World Challenge&quot;. He also created the &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot;, &quot;The Canadians: Biographies of a Nation,&quot; and &quot;The Struggle for Democracy&quot; series; the last has since aired in over 40 countries around the world. It took five years to make, was filmed in 30 countries and was, at the time, the most expensive original documentary series ever made for Canadian television. The &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot; were an initiative of Watson&#x27;s begun in 1988 at Charles Bronfman&#x27;s CRB Foundation (now The Historica Dominion Institute).

Watson was chairman of the CBC from 1989 until 1994. He was the recipient of honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Mount Allison University in 2002 and the University of Toronto in 2004. He was invested as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981, then promoted to Companion in 2002. Watson continued to write, lecture, advise, and work in many capacities in broadcasting. He was married to Caroline Furey Bamford. Watson has acted in more than 50 dramatic productions, including the movie &quot;The Terry Fox Story&quot;, and the HBO movie &quot;Countdown to Looking Glass&quot;.

==Personal life==
His left leg was amputated above the knee in 1960 due to injuries sustained when he fell from a ladder. He often assisted the Canadian disabled community, including serving as honorary chair of the Canadian Amputee Sports Association and chairman emeritus of the Canadian Abilities Foundation. He also had a small cameo role in the 1983 film &quot;The Terry Fox Story&quot; as an amputee farmer who breaks away from a crowd of spectators to run a short distance alongside Terry Fox.

Watson was married to Caroline Bamford, and had two sons and a daughter. He died at his home in Ontario on July 4, 2022.

<text>Samuel Hunter Christie FRS (22 March 1784 – 24 January 1865) was a British physicist and mathematician.

==Life==
He studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won the Smith&#x27;s Prize and was second wrangler. He was particularly interested in magnetism, studying the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and designing improvements to the magnetic compass. Some of his magnetic research was done in collaboration with Peter Barlow. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1826, delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1833 and served as their Secretary from 1837 to 1853. In 1833 he published his &#x27;diamond&#x27; method, the forerunner of the Wheatstone bridge, in a paper on the magnetic and electrical properties of metals, as a method for comparing the resistances of wires of different thicknesses. However, the method went unrecognised until 1843, when Charles Wheatstone proposed it, in another paper for the Royal Society, for measuring resistance in electrical circuits. Although Wheatstone presented it as Christie&#x27;s invention, it is his name, rather than Christie&#x27;s, that is now associated with the device.

Christie taught mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from 1838 until his retirement in 1854. 
He died at Twickenham, on 24 January 1865.

A portrait photograph of Christie in 1865 by Ernest Edwards is held by the National Portrait Gallery.

==Family==
He had ten children (five with each wife), of whom eight survived him. 
His eldest son with his second wife was the astronomer William Henry Mahoney Christie (1845–1922).

Samuel Christie is the son of one James Christie

<text>The Taylor Institution (commonly known as the Taylorian) is the Oxford University library dedicated to the study of the languages of Europe. Its building also includes lecture rooms used by the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages, University of Oxford. Since 1889, an Annual Lecture on a subject of Foreign Literature has been given at the Taylorian Institution.

==History==
The Taylor Institution was established in 1845, funded largely by a bequest from the estate of the notable architect Sir Robert Taylor (1714–1788). Modern European languages were not then taught at the University. (Not until 1903 were a Medieval and Modern Languages Faculty and Honours School instituted in Oxford.) Since the Bodleian Library lacked space, the Taylorian was initially used to house things as varied as Stubbs&#x27;s lectures on English history and the Hope collection of butterflies.

==Description==
The institution and its library are found in the east wing of a neo-classical building at the southern end of St Giles&#x27;. It was designed by Charles Cockerell to accommodate the institution and the University Galleries (now the Ashmolean Museum) and opened in 1845. The building was extended to the north along St Giles&#x27; to designs by T.H. Hughes in 1931 and 1938.

The library serves, for the greater part, those studying for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, for the various Master&#x27;s degrees, and for the DPhil at Oxford University. The collections include Modern European languages, among them French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese languages (including the South American Spanish language and the Brazilian Portuguese language) with a total of around five hundred thousand volumes. The Greek and Slavonic collections consist of European languages found further eastward, including the Greek, Slavic (including Russian), Uralic, and Albanian languages.

The library holds many world-class collections. Its holdings in German were started by Max Müller, who brought many publications from Germany, among them many of Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Flugschriften&quot;, including the first edition of his &quot;Sendbrief vom Dolmetschen&quot;, and go up to contemporary German literature. Italian works run from Dante and Tasso through one of the largest collections of Giovanni Battista Guarini&#x27;s seminal &quot;Il Pastor fido&quot; to Foscolo and Futurist manifestos. The Spanish and Portuguese collections contain early editions of Lope de Vega, Camoens, Cervantes, Góngora, Quevedo, and Calderón. Russian first editions are well represented. The library&#x27;s greatest strength, however, lies in its French holdings. Its collection of French Enlightenment authors stars the only complete collection in the world of all the French editions of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; printed in 1759, the year of first publication. The Taylorian also owns one of the only two known copies of the first edition of Benjamin Constant&#x27;s &quot;Adolphe&quot;. The collections include a lock of Goethe&#x27;s hair.

<text>Helmut Hasse (; 25 August 1898 – 26 December 1979) was a German mathematician working in algebraic number theory, known for fundamental contributions to class field theory, the application of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers to local class field theory and diophantine geometry (Hasse principle), and to local zeta functions.

==Life==

Hasse was born in Kassel, Province of Hesse-Nassau, the son of Judge Paul Reinhard Hasse, also written Haße (12 April 1868 – 1 June 1940, son of Friedrich Ernst Hasse and his wife Anna Von Reinhard) and his wife Margarethe Louise Adolphine Quentin (born 5 July 1872 in Milwaukee, daughter of retail toy merchant Adolph Quentin (b. May 1832, probably Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia) and Margarethe Wehr (b. about 1840, Prussia), then raised in Kassel).

After serving in the Imperial German Navy in World War I, he studied at the University of Göttingen, and then at the University of Marburg under Kurt Hensel, writing a dissertation in 1921 containing the Hasse–Minkowski theorem, as it is now called, on quadratic forms over number fields. He then held positions at Kiel, Halle and Marburg. He was Hermann Weyl&#x27;s replacement at Göttingen in 1934.

Hasse was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1932 in Zürich and a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.

In 1933 Hasse had signed the &quot;Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State&quot;.

Politically, he applied for membership in the Nazi Party in 1937, but this was denied to him allegedly due to his remote Jewish ancestry. After the war, he briefly returned to Göttingen in 1945, but was excluded by the British authorities. After brief appointments in Berlin, from 1948 on he settled permanently as professor at University of Hamburg.

He collaborated with many mathematicians, in particular with Emmy Noether and Richard Brauer on simple algebras, and with Harold Davenport on Gauss sums (Hasse–Davenport relations), and with Cahit Arf on the Hasse–Arf theorem.

<doc id="727119" wikidata="Q30898" url="?curid=727119" title="Gilbertese language">
<text>Gilbertese (), also Kiribati (sometimes &quot;Kiribatese&quot;), is an Austronesian language spoken mainly in Kiribati. It belongs to the Micronesian branch of the Oceanic languages.

The word &quot;Kiribati&quot;, the current name of the islands, is the local adaptation of the European name &quot;Gilberts&quot; to Gilbertese phonology. Early European visitors, including Commodore John Byron, whose ships happened on Nikunau in 1765, had named some of the islands the Kingsmill or Kings Mill Islands or for the Northern group &quot;les îles Mulgrave&quot; in French but in 1820 they were renamed, in French, &quot;les îles Gilbert&quot; by Admiral Adam Johann von Krusenstern, after Captain Thomas Gilbert, who, along with Captain John Marshall, had passed through some of these islands in 1788.
Frequenting of the islands by Europeans, Americans and Chinese dates from whaling and oil trading from the 1820s, when no doubt Europeans learnt to speak it, as Gilbertese learnt to speak English and other languages foreign to them. 
The first ever vocabulary list of Gilbertese was published by the French &quot;Revue coloniale&quot; (1847) by an auxiliary surgeon on corvette &quot;Le Rhin&quot; in 1845. His warship took on board a drift Gilbertese of Kuria, that they found near Tabiteuea. However, it was not until Hiram Bingham II took up missionary work on Abaiang in the 1860s that the language began to take on the written form known now.

Bingham was the first to translate the Bible into Gilbertese, and wrote several hymn books, a dictionary (1908, posthumous) and commentaries in the language of the Gilbert Islands. Alphonse Colomb, a French priest in Tahiti wrote in 1888, &quot;Vocabulaire arorai (îles Gilbert) précédé de notes grammaticales d&#x27;après un manuscrit du P. Latium Levêque et le travail de Hale sur la langue Tarawa / par le P. A. C.&quot;. Father Levêque named the Gilbertese &quot;Arorai&quot; (from Arorae) when Horatio Hale called them &quot;Tarawa&quot;. This work was also based on the first known description of Gilbertese in English, published in 1846, in the volume &quot;Ethnology and Philology&quot; of the U.S. Exploring Expedition, compiled by Horatio Hale.

The official name of the language is &quot;te taetae ni Kiribati&quot;, or &#x27;the Gilbertese language&#x27;, but the common name is &quot;te taetae n aomata&quot;, or &#x27;the language of the people&#x27;.

The first complete and comprehensive description of this language was published in &quot;Dictionnaire gilbertin–français&quot; of Father Ernest Sabatier (981 pp, 1952–1954), a Catholic priest. It was later partially translated into English by Sister Olivia, with the help of the South Pacific Commission.

==Speakers==
Over 96% of the 119,000 people living in Kiribati declare themselves I-Kiribati and speak Gilbertese. Gilbertese is also spoken by most inhabitants of Nui (Tuvalu), Rabi Island (Fiji), and some other islands where I-Kiribati have been relocated (Solomon Islands, notably Choiseul Province; and Vanuatu), after the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme or emigrated (to New Zealand and Hawaii mainly).

97% of those living in Kiribati are able to read in Gilbertese, and 80% are able to read English. It is one of the Oceanic languages. The largest individual Oceanic languages are Eastern Fijian with over 600,000 speakers, and Samoan with an estimated 400,000 speakers. The Gilbertese, Tongan, Tahitian, Māori, Western Fijian and Tolai (Gazelle Peninsula) languages each have over 100,000 speakers.

In 2020 Finlayson Park School in Auckland became the first school in New Zealand to set up a Gilbertese language unit, where Erika Taeang was employed as the teacher.

==Dialects==
The Gilbertese language has two main dialects, Northern and Southern. Their main differences are in the pronunciation of some sounds. The islands of Butaritari and Makin also have their own dialect that differs from the standard Kiribati in some vocabulary and pronunciation.

=== Dialect listing ===
* Banaban (Banaba and Rabi Island, Fiji)
* Northern Kiribati (Makin, Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang, Tarawa, Maiana, Kuria, Abemama and Aranuka)
** Butaritari/Makin (Butaritari and Makin)
* Nuian (Tuvalu)
* Southern Kiribati (Tabiteuea, Onotoa, Nonouti, Beru, Nikunau, Tamana and Arorae)

==Phonology==
Gilbertese contrasts 13 consonants and 10 vowel sounds.



The pronunciation is closer to except after velarized and .

Quantity is distinctive for vowels and plain nasal consonants but not for the remaining sounds so that (third person singular article) contrasts with () as well as (). Other minimal pairs include:
== Alphabet ==
The Gilbertese language is written in the Latin script, which was introduced in the 1860s when Hiram Bingham Jr, a Protestant missionary, first translated the Bible into Gilbertese. Until then, the language was unwritten. Since the independence of Kiribati in 1979, long vowels and consonants are represented by doubling the character, as in Dutch and Finnish. A few digraphs are used for the velar nasals () and velarized bilabials (). Bingham and the first Roman Catholic missionaries (1888) did not indicate in their script the vowel length by doubling the character. The discrepancies between the Protestant and Roman Catholic spellings have been an issue since 1895. Neither clearly distinguished the pronunciation of the vowel /a/ after velarized bilabials, like (bw) and (mw), which result in discrepancies between old scripts and modern scripts. For example, the word maneaba should be written &quot;mwaneaba&quot; or even &quot;mwaaneaba&quot; and the atoll of Makin, &quot;Mwaakin&quot;. The Kiribati Protestant Church has also recently used a different script for both velarized bilabials, “b’a” and “m’a”, which are found in Protestant publications.
===Vocabulary===
One difficulty in translating the Bible was references to words such as &quot;mountain&quot;, a geographical phenomenon unknown to the people of the islands of Kiribati at the time, heard only in the myths from Samoa. Bingham substituted &quot;hilly&quot;, which would be more easily understood. Such adjustments are common to all languages as &quot;modern&quot; things require the creation of new words or the usage of loan words.

For example, the Gilbertese word for airplane is &quot;te wanikiba&quot;, &quot;the canoe that flies&quot;. Some words changed to translate Western words into Gilbertese. For example, &quot;te aro&quot; (species or colour) is now used in translating religion. &quot;Te kiri&quot; (the dog), found in 1888 vocabulary, is now less used than &quot;te kamea&quot; (from English, loan word).

Catholic missionaries arrived at the islands in 1888 and translated the Bible independently of Bingham, which led to differences (Bingham wrote Jesus as &quot;Iesu&quot;, but the Catholics wrote &quot;Ietu&quot;) that would be resolved only in the 20th century. In 1954, Father Ernest Sabatier published the larger and more accurate Kiribati to French dictionary (translated into English by Sister Olivia): &quot;Dictionnaire gilbertin–français&quot;, 981 pages (edited by South Pacific Commission in 1971). It remains the only work of importance between the Kiribati language and a Western language. It was then reversed by Frédéric Giraldi in 1995 to creating the first French-Kiribati dictionary. In addition, a grammar section was added by Father Gratien Bermond (MSC). The dictionary is available at the French National Library Rare Language Department and at the headquarters of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC), Issoudun.

=== Loanwords ===
When arriving, the translation of the Bible (&quot;te Baibara&quot;) was the first duty of the missionaries. Protestants (1860) and Roman Catholics (1888) had to find or create some words that were not in use in the Gilbert Islands, like mountain (&quot;te maunga&quot;, borrowing it from Hawaiian &quot;mauna&quot; or Samoan &quot;maunga&quot;), and like serpents, but also to find a good translation for God (&quot;te Atua&quot;). Many words were adapted from English, like &quot;te moko&quot; (smoke), &quot;te buun&quot; (spoon), te beeki (pig), &quot;te raiti&quot; (rice), &quot;te tai&quot; (time, a watch), &quot;te auti&quot; (house), &quot;te katamwa&quot; (cat, from expression &quot;cat-at-me&quot;). Some words of the Swadesh list did not exist in Gilbertese like &quot;te aiti&quot; (ice) or &quot;te tinoo&quot; (snow). But things that did not exist previously also were interpreted to form new Gilbertese words: &quot;te rebwerebwe&quot; (motorbike), &quot;te wanikiba&quot; (plane, a flying canoe), &quot;te momi&quot; (pearl, from Hawaiian).

== Grammar ==
Gilbertese has a basic verb–object–subject word order (VOS).

=== Nouns===
Gilbertese lacks a morphological noun-marker system. This means that—by itself—a noun cannot be identified as such. However, singular nouns can be distinguished from other words, as they are preceded by the article &quot;&quot;&quot;. However, not all singular nouns can take the article. These include names of people and places, words for cardinal directions, and other specific nouns.

Any noun can be formed from a verb or an adjective by preceding it with the article &quot;&quot;&quot;.

*&quot; (to go)
*&quot; (the going)
*&quot; (red)
*&quot; (the redness)

Nouns can be marked for possession (by person and number). Plurality is only marked in some nouns by lengthening the first vowel. Even then, the singular form might be used—despite plural referents—if no other indicators of their plurality are present.

*&quot; (book)
*&quot; (books)

There is no obligatory marked gender. Sex or gender can be marked by adding &#x27; (male) or &#x27; (female) to the noun.

*&quot; (chicken)
*&#x27; (rooster) (writing &#x27; is more usual)
*&#x27; (hen) (writing &#x27; is more usual)
* &quot; (my brother or my sister, if he or she has the same sex as the speaker)
* &quot; (my brother or my sister, if he or she has a different sex from the speaker)

For human nouns, the linker &#x27;n&#x27; may be used.

*&quot; (child)
*&quot; (boy)
*&quot; (girl)

Agent nouns can be created with the particle &#x27; (singular) or &#x27; (plural).

In Gilbertese, nouns can be classified as either animate or inanimate. The category of animate nouns includes humans and most animals, whereas inanimate nouns refer to all other entities.

Possession, when the possessor is inanimate, is marked with the &quot;n&quot; clitic. In writing, it may be joined with the previous word, or written separately. In cases where the &quot;n&quot; marker would be otherwise incompatible with the language&#x27;s phonotactics, one might use &quot;in&quot; or &quot;ni&quot; instead. In phrases where the possessor is animate, a special possessive pronoun needs to be employed (see Pronouns).

Nouns can also be classified as alienable or inalienable. Inalienable nouns include, among others, parts of the body, family, and feelings. Words which are newly introduced into the language are never considered to be inalienable. The meanings of certain words may vary according to whether or not they are considered alienable.

Adjectives can also be formed from nouns by reduplication with the meaning of &quot;abundant in&quot;, e.g., (&quot;rain&quot;), (&quot;rainy&quot;).

=== Articles ===
There are two articles used in Gilbertese:
Neither of them implies definiteness, therefore both can be translated as &quot;a(n)&quot; and &quot;the&quot;.

When preceding collective nouns or names of substances, &quot;&#x27;&quot; can be translated as &quot;some.&quot; A limited set of nouns, typically referring to unique entities, dispense with &#x27;. This includes words like &#x27; &quot;“&quot;sun”, &#x27; “sky”, &#x27; “sea”, among others. Interestingly, &#x27;, “God”, is an exception. The article &#x27; also acts as a nominalizer, transforming adjectives into nouns. While &#x27; marks singular nouns, the language possesses a plural article &#x27;. However, its use is restricted to countable nouns inherently implying plurality. Collective nouns typically don&#x27;t take &#x27;. In certain situations, when plurality is evident from surrounding words, &quot;&quot; can be omitted.

The personal articles are used before personal names. The masculine form is &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; before names beginning with , &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; before , &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; before &lt;a, e, o, n, r, t&gt; and &quot;&#x27; before &lt;k, (ng)&gt;.

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns have different forms according to case: nominative (subject), accusative (object), emphatic (vocatives, adjunct pronouns), genitive (possessives).

=== Demonstratives ===
The Gilbertese language employs a system of demonstratives to indicate the spatial proximity of the referent to the speaker. These demonstratives are postnominal, meaning they follow the noun they modify.
The feminine demonstrative has no plural form, as opposed to the masculine, and the human plural encapsulates groups of mixed gender.

Adverbial pronouns also have a three-way distinction of distance: proximal, medial and distal.

&#x27; is used for hypothetical scenarios that would have an effect today, have they changed in the past. &#x27; is used for situations whereof the outcome or truth is not yet known.

=== Adjectives ===
While they share many similarities with intransitive verbs, there are a few patterns that can be observed among adjectives. Many adjectives, such a&quot;s&quot; (“white”), contain a repeated element. While some non-reduplicated adjectives exist, reduplication appears to be dominant.

Nouns typically lengthen their first vowel to indicate plural. Conversely, adjectives tend to shorten their first vowel for pluralization (e.g., (long - singular) becomes &quot; (long - plural)).

Gilbertese employs distinct strategies for forming comparative and superlative constructions. Comparatives are relatively straightforward, achieved by adding the adverb &#x27; (“more”) after the adjective (e.g., &#x27; (“high”) becomes &#x27; (“higher”)). Expressing “better than” requires the preposition &#x27; (“than”) along with a construction that compares the noun-like qualities derived from the adjectives:

Superlatives are formed with the intensifier &#x27; and the article &#x27; preceding the adjective. For example, &#x27; (“good”) becomes &#x27; (“the best”).

=== Verbs ===
Verbs do not conjugate according to person, number, tense, aspect or mood. These verbal categories are indicated by particles. Nonetheless, a passive suffix &quot; is used as in:

* &quot; He bought the rice.
* &quot; The rice was bought (by him).

Any adjective can also be an intransitive verb. Transitive verbs can be formed by the circumfix &#x27; creating a causative verb, e.g. &quot;&#x27;&quot; (to be red) becomes &quot;&quot; (to redden). Tense is marked by adverbs. However, the default interpretation of the unmarked (by adverbs) verb is a past tense. Below is a list of verbal particles:

* &quot; (immediate, incompleted and indeterminate)
* &quot; (progressive)
* &quot; (prospective future)
* &quot; (general future)
* &quot; (immediate past)
* &quot; (past perfect)

==== Copula verbs ====
There are no verbs corresponding to English &quot;to be&quot;, so a stative verb must be used or a zero copula strategy:

There is also a locative copula verb &quot;mena&quot;:

==== Existential verb ====
There is no corresponding verb to &quot;to have&quot;, instead an existential verb meaning &quot;there to be&quot; is used - .

==== Reduplication ====
In verbs, reduplication is used to mark aspect.

* Partial reduplication marks the habitual aspect for example &quot; (to go) and &quot; (to usually go).
* Full reduplication shows the continuative aspect, e.g. &quot; (to cut), &quot; (to continually cut).
* Mixed: &quot; (to jump), &quot; (to usually jump), &quot; (to continually jump, to be excited), &quot; (to jump on regular occasions).

==== Negation ====
The main negator is the particle &quot; placed after the pronoun and before the verb. The negator &quot; is for counterexpected situations.

&quot;&quot;: You don&#x27;t speak.

=== Numerals ===
Gilbertese uses classifiers for counting with numerals like Asian languages (Chinese, Vietnamese, etc.). These classifiers are suffixes to the numerals: (general, for objects), (animate beings), (plants, land, fish hooks), (fish, elongated objects), (transportation), (leaves, flat objects) among many others. It is a decimal system with as a &quot;10-counting&quot; suffix. Zero (&quot;&quot;) is just the word for &#x27;nothing&#x27;.

=== Conjunctions ===
Multiple nouns may be joined with either (“and”) or (“and; with”). To join adjectives or verb, one may use . The conjunction (“or”) can be used with any part of speech.

In subordinate clauses, the main clause usually comes first, with an appropriate conjunction in-between the two.

<doc id="727121" wikidata="Q306122" url="?curid=727121" title="Hyde (musician)">
<text>, known by his stage name Hyde (stylized in upper or lowercase), is a Japanese musician, singer-songwriter, record producer, and actor. Best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel since 1991, he is also the lead vocalist of Vamps and has a solo career.

Hyde rose to fame in the 1990s as part of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel, who have sold over 40 million records and were the first Japanese act to perform a solo show at Madison Square Garden. He began a successful solo career in 2001, releasing several number one singles, and many of his albums have reached the top five on the Oricon chart. In 2008, Hyde teamed up with K.A.Z to form the hard rock duo Vamps.

Through both his solo career and Vamps, Hyde has collaborated/toured with artists such as Apocalyptica, Motionless in White, Starset, Yoshiki, , In This Moment, and Danzig, and producers such as Kane Churko, Nicholas Furlong, Drew Fulk, and Howard Benson.

==Career==
=== L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel ===

In 1991, Hyde left his band Jelsarem&#x27;s Rod and joined L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel, where he became the main lyricist and vocalist. L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel was signed to Danger Crue Records, where they released their first official album &quot;Dune&quot;. It peaked at number five on Oricon&#x27;s main chart, but topped its independent chart.

In December 1997, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel sold out the 55,000-seat Tokyo Dome in a record-breaking four minutes. Since then, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel has sold-out the Tokyo Dome 16 times. By 2003, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel expanded their market overseas and had their first North American debut at Otakon in Baltimore, playing to an audience of 12,000 people. In April 2008, their Tour 2008 L&#x27;7 Trans Asia via Paris led them to 7 cities across the world, where a total of 320,000 people were in attendance. By 2012, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel became the first-ever Japanese act to sell out Madison Square Garden in New York.

In 2003, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel ranked 58 on a list of the top 100 Japanese pop musicians by HMV Japan.

Between the years 1993–2000, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel released 8 albums and in 1999, becoming the first Japanese musicians to not only release two albums simultaneously, but have both albums reach number 1 and number 2 on the Oricon charts, respectively.

After the success of their eighth studio album, &quot;Real&quot;, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel went on hiatus, during which each of the members pursued solo activities. Three years later, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel returned in 2003 for a series of seven concerts titled &quot;Shibuya Seven Days&quot; in June and July. In March 2004, their ninth album &quot;Smile&quot; was released, and the single &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot; became the opening theme for the anime &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;.

In the summer of 2004, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel officially debuted in North America, where they performed at the anime convention, Otakon in Baltimore, Maryland on July 31, 2004, as part of their Smile tour. The performance was their first international performance outside of Asia.

To celebrate their 20th Anniversary, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel held their 20th L&#x27;Anniversary concert at Ajinomoto Stadium in Tokyo, a two-day event held from May 28–29, 2011, with each day dedicated to one-half of their career. All of the proceeds from the concerts were donated to the Great East Japan earthquake relief efforts.

In 2012, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel released their twelfth studio album, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, at the beginning of their first world tour. The tour led the band to Shanghai, Taipei, London, Paris, Singapore, New York, Indonesia, Seoul, Japan, and concluded in Hawaii. On March 23, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel became the first Japanese act to ever perform at Madison Square Garden. At their concert in Hawaii, the mayor of Honolulu, Peter Carlisle, appeared at the show and declared May 31 to be &quot;L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel Day&quot;, saying he felt the band &quot;made a great contribution to cultural activities, and built a bridge of friendship between Hawaii and Japan&quot;.

In 2014, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel performed at the National Stadium in Tokyo. A year later in 2015, the band put on yet another two-day event called &quot;L&#x27;ArCasino&quot;, which was held outdoors at the Yumeshima Outdoor Special Stage in Osaka, constructed specifically for their use. L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel announced a 23-city tour in 2020.

=== 2000–2003: Going solo ===
Hyde made his debut as a solo artist with the release of his first single, &quot;evergreen&quot; in October 2001. The single was released under Hyde&#x27;s own record label, Haunted Records, which was a division of Sony&#x27;s Ki/oon Records. After releasing two more singles, &quot;Angel&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Shallow Sleep,&quot; Hyde released his first solo album, &quot;Roentgen&quot;, in March 2002. An overseas edition featuring all-English lyrics was released in July of the same year.

In April 2003, Hyde starred alongside fellow Japanese rock musician Gackt in the film &quot;Moon Child&quot;, which was co-written by Gackt himself. The duo performed the duet &quot;Orenji no Taiyou&quot;, which was used as the movie&#x27;s theme song. The song was also released on Gackt&#x27;s fourth full-length album, &quot;Crescent&quot;.

Hyde followed up &quot;Roentgen&quot; with the release of two singles, &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot;, in June and November 2003, respectively. &quot;Horizon&quot; was used as the ending theme in Ryuhei Kitamura&#x27;s film &quot;Sky High&quot;. His second solo album, &quot;666&quot;, was released in December 2003. That same month, Hyde&#x27;s song &quot;Shining Over You&quot; was used as the commercial theme for the video game &quot;Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean&quot;.

In early 2004, Hyde began off his first-ever solo tour &quot;Hyde 2004 First Tour: 666&quot;, which spanned 11 cities and 21 shows across Japan. In fall 2004, Hyde starred in his second film, &quot;Kagen no Tsuki&quot;, a live-action film adaption of the manga created by Ai Yazawa. In the film, Hyde&#x27;s song &quot;The Cape of Storms&quot; from his previously released &quot;Roentgen&quot; album was used as a plot line, and became the unofficial theme song for the movie.

=== 2005–2006: &quot;Faith&quot; and going international ===
In the summer of 2005, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel released their 10th studio album, &quot;Awake&quot;. However, Hyde continued his solo activities in conjunction with L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s work. He composed the music for the song &quot;Glamorous Sky&quot;, which was used in the live-action film adaption of &quot;Nana&quot;, the popular manga by Ai Yazawa. &quot;Glamorous Sky&quot; was performed by the movie&#x27;s star Mika Nakashima, with Yazawa writing the lyrics. In August, Hyde and Nakashima performed &quot;Glamorous Sky&quot; live for the first time on the music program &quot;Music Station,&quot; with Hyde on guitar.

Hyde&#x27;s fifth solo single &quot;Countdown&quot; was released in October 2005 as the first song to be released off his album &quot;Faith&quot;. The single was released in both Japanese and English, and featured a hard rock version of Hyde&#x27;s single &quot;Evergreen&quot;. The Japanese version of &quot;Countdown&quot; was used for the Japanese movie &quot;Stealth&quot;.

A cover of &quot;Countdown&quot; was used as the &quot;semi-final&quot; stage song in the Nintendo DS rhythm game, &quot;Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2&quot;.

Later that month, Hyde hosted &quot;Halloween of the Living Dead&quot;, a three-night event held at Club Citta from October 29–31, marking the first of many Halloween concerts to come. Each night of &quot;Halloween of the Living Dead&quot; featured performances not only by Hyde himself, but by other well-known Japanese musicians as well . Hyde created the special Halloween band, Jack-O-Lantern, specifically for the event, which consisted Hyde himself and the band, Monoral. Other artists/bands who took part in the three-day Halloween event included Uverworld, Olivia Lufkin, High and Mighty Color, Yasu (Janne Da Arc / Acid Black Cherry), and Mika Nakashima. Jack-O-Lantern played covers of their own respective works, as well as a cover of the original &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme song.

Hyde&#x27;s single &quot;Season&#x27;s Call&quot; was released in February 2006 as the second opening theme to the anime &quot;Blood+&quot; and was the second single to be released off his album &quot;Faith&quot;. &quot;Faith&quot; was released in April 2006, and was the first full-length collaboration between Hyde and K.A.Z, with all songs arranged by the duo.

In 2006, Hyde signed on with Tofu Records as a solo artist, and in June 2006, an overseas version of &quot;Faith&quot; was released which included a bonus DVD featuring music videos for both &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;Season&#x27;s Call&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Faith&quot;, Hyde, supported by Tofu Records, launched his debut U.S. tour Hyde Faith Tour 2006 across several cities in California. A DVD was released in November 2006 which included documentary footage of Hyde&#x27;s mini-U.S. tour.

=== 2007–2017: Vamps ===
In the spring of 2008, Hyde rejoined the guitarist, K.A.Z (Oblivion Dust), who had previously worked with him on both &quot;666&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;, and formed the hard rock unit, Vamps. Vamps was signed to Vamprose, which was originally Hyde&#x27;s own record label, &quot;Haunted Records.&quot; Hyde assumed the role of lead vocalist, as well as rhythm guitarist, lyricist, and composer, while K.A.Z took on lead guitar, backing vocalist, and composer.

The rock duo released their first single &quot;Love Addict&quot; in July 2008. The first band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Vamps,&quot; was released in June 2009, just one month before their first international tour.

Following the release of their first album, Vamps launched a ten-date tour in the United States, beginning July 11, 2009, with performances in New York, Hartford, Columbia, Baltimore, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Las Vegas, San Diego, and Los Angeles. Their appearances in Hartford and Columbia were part of the Vans Warped Tour, making them the only Japanese act in the lineup that year. Their final performance in the United States took place at the Wiltern Theatre in L.A. and was later released on DVD. Vamps performed on board the battleship U.S.S. Missouri in Hawaii in early September, the first musical act to do so since Cher.

After the band&#x27;s live tour in the U.S., they were named in the category &quot;Billboard Japan Ranking International 2009&quot; in recognition of their success overseas. In July 2010, Vamps released their second album, &quot;Beast&quot;. Hyde also debuted as a voice actor in &quot;Bakuman&quot;, playing the producer of the musician Koogy, a character who is voiced by Showtaro Morikubo. Vamps wrote a Japanese version of their song &quot;Get Up&quot; to be sung by Morikubo&#x27;s character, which was used in the anime. They then recorded it themselves as the coupling track to their single, &quot;Memories.&quot;
In 2013, Vamps signed on with Universal Music Group&#x27;s Delicious Deli Records and released their first compilation album, &quot;Sex Blood Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot;. In support of &quot;Sex Blood Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot;, Vamps teamed up with Live Nation for their first European tour in years, which also included their first performance at a European rock festival, where they played the Download Festival 2014, held at Donington Park that year.

Vamps held their first-ever music festival, Vampark Festival 2015 in February at Nippon Budokan and featured acts such as Nothing More, Gerard Way (My Chemical Romance), Buckcherry, , and Apocalyptica. By April, they began their 2015 world tour in Jakarta before embarking on Sixx:A.M.’s U.S. “The Modern Vintage” tour as a support act. After the brief tour with Sixx:A.M., Vamps made their North American rock festival debut, performing at festivals such as Fort Rock, Welcome to Rockville, and Rock on the Range. They concluded their 2015 spring tour with a headlining show at the Best Buy Theatre in New York.

In addition to touring with Sixx:A.M. that spring, Vamps also headlined shows in Paris, London, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and all over Japan.

In early 2016, the band headed to the studio in Los Angeles with Grammy-nominated producer, Howard Benson (My Chemical Romance, Three Days Grace), to work on recording music for their fourth full-length album, &quot;Underworld&quot;. Vamps also performed on MTV: Unplugged for the first time with Apocalyptica and the show would be released on DVD/Blu-ray later on that year.

They returned to North America at the end of the year, headlining major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, and Mexico City, supported by rock band Citizen Zero.

Vamps released their 12th single, &quot;Inside of Me&quot; in September 2017, with the title track featuring the musician Chris Motionless of the band Motionless In White. Vamps co-wrote &quot;Rise or Die&quot;, the single&#x27;s coupling song, with Richard Kruspe (Emigrate/Rammstein).

Vamps&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Underworld,&quot; was released at the end of April in 2017. On May 27, 2017, Vamps performed at the Blackest of the Black festival, hosted by Glenn Danzig, marking their 4th U.S. rock festival performance, featuring major American rock musicians Ministry, Atreyu, Suicidal Tendencies, and Danzig. Vamps then returned to Japan for a summer tour, but returned to the U.S. once more in the fall, marking their final tour before going on hiatus.

Hyde teamed up with Drew Fulk (Bullet for My Valentine, Bad Wolves, Motionless in White) and Nick Furlong (Blink-182, Papa Roach, 5 Seconds of Summer, Diplo), among other producers, to write 10 songs for the album. The CD version of the album reached number 3 on the Billboard charts in Japan and marked his second full-length English album as a solo artist.

Following the conclusion of his domestic tour, Hyde was invited to tour as a support act for Starset on their 35-date U.S. “Divisions” tour.

Hyde became a tourism ambassador for his hometown, Wakayama, in January 2019, and following his appointment, a train service named &quot;Hyde Southern&quot; began operating between Namba Station and Wakayamakō Station in Wakayama Prefecture. The trains, decorated with images of Hyde and local landmarks, ran until October 2020.

By the end of 2019, Hyde concluded the fall with his arena tour Hyde Live 2019 Anti Final and ended 2019 by performing at the event Rockin&#x27;on presents Countdown Japan 19/20 on December 29.

==Influences and style==
Hyde has cited Dead End, D&#x27;erlanger, Gastunk, the Misfits, David Sylvian, Mötley Crüe, Depeche Mode, and Off Course as influences.

<text>Sir Basil Henry Blackwell (29 May 18899 April 1984) was an English bookseller.

==Biography==
Blackwell was born in Oxford, England. He was the son of Benjamin Henry Blackwell (18491924), founder of Blackwell&#x27;s bookshop in Oxford, which went on to become the Blackwell family&#x27;s publishing and bookshop empire, located on Broad Street in central Oxford. The publishing arm is now part of Wiley-Blackwell.

He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford and Merton College, Oxford. He was the first person in his family to attend university. In 1913, he began working with his father at Blackwell&#x27;s. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1924, he took over the company and remained working there for decades. He married Marion Christine Soans. Their daughter was Dame Penelope Jessel.

He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1956 by Queen Elizabeth II, the only bookseller ever to receive that honour. In 1959, he was elected to an honorary Fellowship at Merton. In 1970, he was given the honorary Freedom of the City of Oxford.

In 1979, he was awarded a Doctorate of Civil Law honoris causa at the Oxford Encaenia. 

Blackwell was a prosecution witness in the 1966 private prosecution attempt to bar the book &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; from UK publication.

<text>The Miniature Fox Terrier is a small, fine, lightweight working terrier developed as a hunting dog and vermin router. It is known colloquially in its native Australia as the “Mini Foxie”.

== Appearance ==

A balanced, smoothly-muscled dog breed, the Miniature Fox Terrier has a small sized, distinctive head with erectile ears that can stand straight up or fold at the tips. Another distinguishing feature is its articulate, oval-shaped foot - a feature found in very few small breeds of dog. The breed standard has always allowed for the dog&#x27;s tail to be docked or undocked, however owners need to be aware of and obey local laws in this regard. Natural bobtails are known to occur. There are only three permitted colour combinations: black &amp; white, tan &amp; white, and black, tan &amp; white. The coat of the Miniature Fox Terrier is always short and fine. Weight is 3.5 to 5.5 kilograms (8 to 12 lbs) and height at the withers is 9.5 to 12.0 inches (24 cm to 30.5 cm).

Miniature Fox Terriers are closely related to the Toy Fox Terrier, a breed that developed along similar lines in the United States. Some Toy Fox Terrier owners can trace their dogs’ pedigrees to &quot;Foiler&quot;, the first Fox Terrier registered by the Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875–6. Other related breeds include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Rat Terrier, and the Tenterfield Terrier.

===Temperament===
Bred for hunting rodents (rats, mice) and rabbits principally, these dogs are known for their speed and agility. With the ruthlessness of their attack on rodent pest species and their ability to squeeze into and out of tight spaces, they have made themselves an indispensable part of many Australian farms since the 19th Century. Miniature Fox Terriers have proved well-suited to being domestic pets in more urban environments (according to the breed club). Their diminutive size, short clean hair and loyal acceptance of their place in the social hierarchy make them good pets, particularly in households with small children. They thrive on positive socialisation and are happy to be rewarded with pats and being praised when being trained and trainers do not have to rely on treats to obtain a good result.

Miniature Fox Terriers generally get along well with other animals but, like most working terriers, cannot distinguish between small pets—such as reptiles and fancy rats—and vermin, and so should not be left alone with such animals. They are confident and will generally interact with dogs and other animals many times their size and have fun times.

== History ==
The breed was most likely developed from crosses between smaller Fox Terriers and Fox Terrier types and Toy Manchester Terriers, and, later, some were crossed to other toy breeds such as the English Toy Terrier and Whippet. Hunters were seeking a smaller, speedy Fox Terrier that could be used for hunting smaller pests such as rats and rabbits. Although the origins of the breed are English, the breed was developed in and is endemic to Australia. By the late 19th century, the breed type was clearly identifiable and these small terriers proved their worth against rabbits, rats, and snakes on Australian farms, where they were often known simply as &quot;the little foxies&quot;. The dogs demonstrated tenacity, endurance, and extreme loyalty to their owners; they were routinely taken on the hunt, were sometimes used in search parties, and were used at Sydney’s North Head Quarantine Station, the Riverstone Meat Works, and the Brisbane City Council as vermin exterminators.

The dog’s vigilance, size, affectionate temperament, and ease of care soon resulted in its becoming a popular choice in urban centers as well, and by the 1920s the Miniature Fox Terrier was iconic. So well known and popular was the “Little Foxie” that very little thought was given to the need to preserve its lines.

===History of the breed club===
By the 1980s, the interest in dog fancy, the looming spectre of proposed breed-specific legislation, and increasing concerns about the need to protect purebred dogs led a group of enthusiasts to begin meeting informally to consider the future of these little dogs. In July 1986, the Miniature Fox Terrier Club of Australia (MFCA) was formed. The founding members, in conjunction with members of the Royal NSW Canine Council, wrote a breed standard for the breed and laid out a Constitution for the Club. To comply with New South Wales government regulations for becoming an incorporated organization, the Miniature Fox Terrier Club became incorporated as the Mini Foxie Club of Australia, Inc. in 1992.

In 1991, fanciers in South Australia also formed a breed club. For these members, official recognition of the dog by the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) was the most important of their goals. At that time, challenges to the name “Miniature Fox Terrier” were being mounted, and threatened to preclude recognition by an All-Breed club. These members joined with some owners in Western Australia and organised as the Tenterfield Terrier Club of Australia (1993), a name which was first used by a television presenter Burke from Burke&#x27;s Backyard.

The ensuing breed standard for the Tenterfield Terrier differs in substance from that of the Miniature Fox Terrier, and though the two dogs are sometimes confused, they have been developing along divergent lines for over twenty years and are now different breeds. Some years ago the ANKC placed a moratorium on the registration of any MFCA-registered Miniature Fox Terrier as a Tenterfield Terrier. MFCA registered pedigrees are protected by Australian Copyright Law.

The breed is not recognized by the ANKC and the independent Mini Foxie Club of Australia Inc. holds the registry of pedigrees for this breed. The club also organises shows, prints a quarterly newsletter and promotes a lively and friendly atmosphere amongst members. The club&#x27;s strict policies that were put in place to protect the health and soundness of this unique breed have paid dividends. 

In 2005, the breed names Miniature Fox Terrier and Mini Foxie were added to the list of dog breeds recognized under the NSW Companion Animals Act. MFCA registered breeders can register their breeding dogs with their local council.

==The Miniature Fox Terrier today==
Although still relatively unknown outside of Australia and New Zealand, &quot;the little foxie&quot; is renowned in its native land. Parliamentarians have made reference to the breed during legislative hearings on canine issues. &#x27;Pasqua&#x27; and ‘Fergus’ owned by Anthony Field of The Wiggles, are Miniature Fox Terriers now aged 17. Ian Thorpe, the Australian swimmer, has spoken fondly of Tiny, his Miniature Fox Terrier, in several interviews. Sean Carlow, Australian men&#x27;s figure skating champion, owns a Miniature Fox Terrier. Television and print media have also featured Toby Allen of Human Nature with his Miniature Fox Terriers.

Today, the Miniature Fox Terrier is still very much a working terrier and is in demand on farms across Australia. They remain popular as pets and enjoy playing the pampered pooch. As long as their active minds are kept stimulated with games or toys and they receive at least moderate exercise, they make excellent pets for anyone with kids, the elderly and are great companions.

<doc id="727152" wikidata="Q6041943" url="?curid=727152" title="Instrumentality of Mankind">
<text>In the science fiction of Cordwainer Smith, the Instrumentality of Mankind refers both to Smith&#x27;s personal future history and universe and to the central government of humanity within that fictional universe. &quot;The Instrumentality of Mankind&quot; is also the title of a paperback collection of short stories by Cordwainer Smith published in 1979 (now superseded by the later &quot;The Rediscovery of Man&quot;, which collects all of Smith&#x27;s short stories).

==Origin and history==

In the history of Cordwainer Smith&#x27;s &quot;Instrumentality&quot; universe, the Instrumentality originated as the police force of the Jwindz or &quot;perfect ones&quot; on a post-nuclear holocaust Earth. After attaining power and the expansion of humans in space, they eventually entered a somewhat stagnant phase in which a fixed lifespan of four hundred years was imposed on the human inhabitants of the planets where the Instrumentality directly ruled, all the hard physical labor was done by rightless animal-derived &quot;underpeople&quot;, and children were never raised by their biological parents. This somewhat empty and sterile system was reformed and enlivened by the &quot;Rediscovery of Man&quot;, the backdrop against which Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;Norstrilia&quot; and the majority of his short stories, covering thousands of years of fictional time, are set. The cycle does not come to a final resolution; in 2010, Frederik Pohl — who, as the editor of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, made the initial decision to purchase and publish the stories — said that Smith had told him of losing the notebook in which he wrote down his ideas for more Instrumentality material:
[Smith had] been in a small boat somewhere (...) and he had leaned incautiously over the side … and the notebook had fallen out of his breast pocket into the water … and he [had] been able to watch it dropping through the crystal-clear water until at last it was out of sight, and was gone.
Algis Budrys in 1965 praised Smith for creating &quot;a completely consistent phantom universe&quot;, in which stories are not sequels to each other but &quot;tesserae in a mosaic&quot;. Other authors, he said—including himself—connected stories with a common character or theme; &quot;Not Smith. He&#x27;s not inventing, he&#x27;s reporting. And he&#x27;s doing it from God&#x27;s point of view&quot;, and only the lack of time prevented Smith from portraying all of the &quot;infinite&quot; fictional setting.

==Characteristics==

Though the Instrumentality does not directly administer every planet, it claims ultimate guardianship over the destiny of the human race. For example, it strictly bans the export of religion from planet to planet. Its members, the Lords and Ladies of the Instrumentality, are collectively all-powerful and often somewhat callously arbitrary. Although their motives are theoretically benign, they act with utmost brutality when survival is at stake.

According to the story &quot;Drunkboat&quot;: 

Each was a plenum of the low, the middle, and the high justice. Each could do anything he found necessary or proper to maintain the Instrumentality and keep the peace between the worlds. ... The Instrumentality had the perpetual slogan &#x27;Watch, but do not govern; stop war, but do not wage it; protect, but do not control; and first, survive!&#x27;
==Individual members==

Some prominent Lords and Ladies of the Instrumentality:

*Lord Jestocost (the latest of a dynasty of that name), descendant of Lady Goroke
*Lady Panc Ashash (as a posthumous personality recording; the eponymous &quot;Dead Lady of Clown Town&quot;.)
*Lord Femtiosex
*Lord Sto Odin
*Lord Crudelta
*Lady Alice More, partner of the seventh Lord Jestocost.
*Lady Arabella Underwood
*Lady Johanna Gnade
*Lord Redlady

The names Goroke, Femtiosex, Sto Odin and Panc Ashash are number-word names of the type common during the Instrumentality&#x27;s decadent period: &quot;five-six&quot; in Japanese is &quot;Go-Roku&quot;, in Hindi it is &quot;Panc-Ashash&quot;, and in Swedish &quot;Femtiosex&quot; (literally &quot;fifty-six&quot;). &#x27;Tiga-belas&#x27; and &#x27;Veesey-koosey&#x27;, the names of supporting and main characters of the Instrumentality story &quot;Think Blue, Count Two&quot;, also mean &#x27;thirteen&#x27; (Indonesian or Malay &quot;tiga&quot; meaning three, and &quot;belas&quot; being equivalent of English &quot;teen&quot;) and &#x27;five-six&#x27; (Finnish &quot;viisi&quot; and &quot;kuusi&quot;), respectively. &quot;Sto Odin&quot; is &quot;a hundred and one&quot; in Russian. The name Jestocost is based on the word for &quot;cruelty&quot; in Russian (жестокость), and Crudelta is the equivalent in Italian (&quot;crudeltà&quot;, feminine). Gnade is a German word meaning &quot;grace&quot; or &quot;mercy&quot;.

== Cultural references ==

The Human Instrumentality Project in the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; anime series is a reference to Cordwainer&#x27;s works. A password used in the anime &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;, &quot;Think Bule Count One Tow&quot; (used by Lain&#x27;s father) is a misspelled reference to &quot;Think Blue, Count Two&quot;.

The Dreadstar comic book features the Church of the Instrumentality which is a space empire. The church has created a race of cat-people, similar to the underpeople of the Instrumentality of Mankind.
In the light novel series &quot;Log Horizon&quot;, the animal-like Werecat, Wolf Fang, and Fox Tail races were created by what was called the Norstrilia Project, in reference to his novel. The anime series &quot;Fafner in the Azure&quot; is based on concepts of telepathic warfare against an unknown enemy similar to those explored in &quot;The Game of Rat and Dragon&quot;. Furthermore, the robot piloted by the main character in the first half of the series bears the name &quot;Mark Elf&quot;, shared by another story set in the Instrumentality fictional universe.

<doc id="727153" wikidata="Q3884021" url="?curid=727153" title="Operation Sundevil">
<text>Operation Sundevil was a 1990 nationwide United States Secret Service crackdown on &quot;illegal computer hacking activities.&quot; It involved raids in approximately fifteen different cities and resulted in three arrests and the confiscation of computers, the contents of electronic bulletin board systems (BBSes), and floppy disks. It was revealed in a press release on May 9, 1990. The arrests and subsequent court cases resulted in the creation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The operation is now seen as largely a public-relations stunt. Operation Sundevil has also been viewed as one of the preliminary attacks on the Legion of Doom and similar hacking groups. The raid on Steve Jackson Games, which led to the court case &quot;Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service&quot;, is often attributed to Operation Sundevil, but the Electronic Frontier Foundation states that it is unrelated and cites this attribution as a media error.

The name comes from the Sun Devil Stadium of Arizona State University, near the local Secret Service headquarters from where the investigation and raids were coordinated.

==Background==
Prior to 1990, people who manipulated telecommunication systems, known as phreakers, were generally not prosecuted within the United States. The majority of phreakers used software to obtain calling card numbers and built simple tone devices in order to make free telephone calls. A small elite, highly technical segment of phreakers were more interested in information about the inner workings of the telecommunication system than in making free phone calls. Phone companies complained of financial losses from phreaking activities. The switch from analog to digital equipment began to expose more of the inner workings of telephone companies as hackers began to explore the switches and trunks. Due to a lack of laws and expertise on the part of American law enforcement, few cases against hackers were prosecuted until Operation Sundevil.

However, starting in 1989, the US Secret Service (USSS), which had been given authority from Congress to deal with access device fraud as an extension of wire fraud investigations under Title 18 (§ 1029), began to investigate. Over the course of the 18-month-long investigation, the USSS gathered alleged evidence of rampant credit card and calling card fraud over state lines.

Operation Sundevil allowed multiple federal law enforcement agencies, particularly the Secret Service and the FBI, to gain valuable expertise on fighting this new form of criminal activity as well as expanding the agencies&#x27; budgets. New laws were created to allow federal prosecutors to charge individuals accused of phreaking, hacking, wire, and credit card fraud. Evidence gained from Operation Sundevil allowed law enforcement to convince the United States Congress of the need for additional funding, training, and overall expansion.

==Action==
Along with the Chicago Task Force and the Arizona Organized Crime and Racketeering Bureau, the operation involved raids in Austin, Plano, Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Newark, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Tucson, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle. The raids were centered in Arizona, where the press conference occurred.

Raids generally took place in middle-class suburbs and targeted credit card thieves and telephone abusers. They were carried out by local police, with the aid of over 150 Secret Service agents, FBI and CIA. Twenty-seven search warrants, resulting in three arrests, were issued and executed on May 7 and 8, 1990. Police also took around 42 computers and approximately 25 BBSes, including some of the most infamous and elite hacking BBSs in the world at that time, such as Cloud Nine. This was the largest crackdown on electronic bulletin boards in world history. Finally, about 23,000 floppy disks were also seized. These held a variety of data, including software, phreaking and hacking tools, tens of thousands of credit card details, and a plethora of illegal copyrighted material. The three people arrested were &quot;Tony the Trashman,&quot; &quot;Dr. Ripco,&quot; and &quot;Electra.&quot;

Other parts of the operation targeted the underground ezine &quot;Phrack&quot;, which had published the contents of a proprietary text file copied from BellSouth computers and containing information about the E911 emergency response system, although this was later made null in a court case in which it was proven that the same information about the E911 system was also provided to the public through a mail-order catalog.

==Aftermath==
In a press release on May 9, 1990, officials from the federal government and the Arizona state government revealed that the Secret Service was involved in the investigation. The Assistant Director of the US Secret Service, Garry M. Jenkins, commented in a press release that, &quot;the Secret Service is sending a clear message to those computer hackers who have decided to violate the laws of this nation in the mistaken belief that they can successfully avoid detection by hiding behind the relative anonymity of their computer terminals.&quot;

Two public-access computer systems were shut down in the days following the operation: an AT&amp;T Unix system in Dallas, Texas and a Jolnet system in Lockport, Illinois. Neither has been linked to the operation, however. An AT&amp;T spokesman claimed the shutdown was a result of an internal investigation and was not related to the operation.

In response to the arrests, the Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded by Mitchell Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corporation, and John Perry Barlow, an author. The foundation hired lawyers to represent the hackers in two of the cases arising from Operation Sundevil.

Operation Sundevil was the most publicized action by the federal government against hackers. In part due to this, it has been seen as a public-relations stunt and a message to hackers. While it did little overall damage to the hacking community in the long run, it did stop the illicit hacking activities of many of the best hackers in the world for a short period of time, which is why it has been lauded as a tactical success due to the surprise and damage it caused to the communities in comparison to the long wars waged against the Legion of Doom. However, it has also been criticized as a failure due to several unsuccessful prosecutions, and a number of raids not even leading to arrest.

<text>American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, also known as Joint or JDC, is a Jewish relief organization based in New York City. Since 1914 the organisation has supported Jewish people living in Israel and throughout the world. The organization is active in more than 70 countries.

The JDC offers aid to Jewish populations in Centraland Eastern Europe as well as in the Middle East through a network of social and community assistance programs. In addition, the JDC contributes millions of dollars in disaster relief and development assistance to non-Jewish communities.

== History ==
The JDC was founded in 1914, initially to provide assistance to Jews living in Palestine in the Ottoman Empire.

The JDC began its efforts to save Jews with a donation of $50,000 from Jacob Schiff, a wealthy Jewish entrepreneur and philanthropist. He was the main funder of the organization and helped raise funds to save and aid Jews around the world. Additionally, the American Jewish Relief Committee helped collect funds for the JDC. Several wealthy, Reform Jews founded the American Jewish Relief Committee on October 25, 1914. Jacob Schiff was one of these men, along with Louis Marshall, the president of the committee, and Felix M. Warburg. The Central Relief Committee, founded on October 4, 1914, also helped provide funds to the JDC. Eastern European, Orthodox Jews, such as Leon Kamaiky, founded this organization. Almost one year later, in August 1915, the socialist People&#x27;s Relief Committee, headed by Meyer London, joined in to provide funds to the JDC. After a few years, the JDC and the organizations assisting it had raised significant funds and were able to make a noteworthy impact. By the end of 1917, the JDC had transferred $76,000 to Romania, $1,532,300 to Galicia, $2,5532,000 to Russia, and $3,000,000 to a German-occupied Poland and Lithuania. By 1920, the JDC had set nearly $5,000,000 to assist the Jews in Poland. Between 1919 and 1920, during the emergency relief period, the JDC had disbursed over $22,000,000 to help in restoration and relief across Europe.

By 1914, approximately 59,000 Jews were living in Palestine under Ottoman rule. The settlement—the &quot;Yishuv&quot;—was largely made up of Jews that had emigrated from Europe and were largely dependent on sources outside of Palestine for their income. The outbreak of World War I destroyed those channels, leaving the community isolated and destitute. With disaster looming, the &quot;Yishuv&quot;’s leaders appealed to Henry Morgenthau, Sr., then the U.S. ambassador to Turkey. Morgenthau was moved and appalled by the misery he witnessed. Soon after seeing what he did, Morgenthau sent an urgent cable to New York-based Jewish philanthropist Jacob Schiff, requesting $50,000 of aid to keep the Jews of Palestine from starvation and death.

Dated August 31, 1914, the Western Union cablegram read, in part:

:PALESTINIAN JEWS FACING TERRIBLE CRISIS … BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES STOPPING THEIR ASSISTANCE … SERIOUS DESTRUCTION THREATENS THRIVING COLONIES … FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS NEEDED.

The plea found concerned ears in the U.S. In a month, $50,000 (the equivalent of $1 million in the year 2000) was raised through the efforts of what was intended to be an ad hoc and temporary collective of three existing religious and secular Jewish organizations: the American Jewish Relief Committee, the Central Committee for the Relief of Jews Suffering Through the War, and People&#x27;s Relief Committee.

In 1915, a greater crisis arose when the Jewish communities of the Pale of Settlement in Russia became caught up in the fighting along the World War I Eastern Front. Under the leadership of Judah Magnes the Committee was able to raise another five million dollars by the end of the year. In 1921, following the post-revolutionary civil war of Russia, the Committee was one of only two organizations left in America sending aid to combat the famine.

==Mission==
JDC fulfills its mission on four fronts:

*Rescue of Jews at risk. JDC&#x27;s expertise is crisis response. JDC works with local partner agencies to address immediate needs.
*Relief for Jews in need. In addition to emergency aid, JDC support builds the capacity of local agencies to sustain and enhance quality of life for struggling communities.
*Renewal of Jewish community life.
*Israel. JDC works in partnership with the Israeli government and other local organizations to improve the lives of the elderly, immigrants, children at risk, the disabled, and the chronically unemployed. In 2007, the JDC was awarded the Israel Prize for its lifetime achievements and special contribution to society and the State of Israel.

=== Leadership ===
The organisation was led by Moses A. Leavitt until his death in 1965; Leavitt was then succeeded by Charles H. Jordan. Jordan died in Prague in 1967. His death was declared suicide by Czechoslovak government, in the context of communist denouncements of the JDC at the time, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported his death as mysterious. In 1974, Czechoslovak defector Josef Frolik advised the Central Intelligence Agency in 1974 that Jordan had been abducted by Arab agents and died during interrogation by Palestinians at the Egyptian embassy in Prague.

==Projects==

The Joint Distribution Committee finances programs to assist impoverished Jews in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe, providing food, medicine, home care, and other critical aid to elderly Jews and children in need. The JDC also enables small Jewish populations in Latin American, African, and Asian countries to maintain essential social services and help ensure a Jewish future for their youth and youth to come. In Israel, JDC responds to crisis-related needs while helping to improve services to the elderly, children and youth, new immigrants, the disabled, and other vulnerable populations.

In the spirit of &quot;tikkun olam&quot;, a Hebrew phrase referring to the moral responsibility to repair the world and alleviate suffering, the JDC has contributed funding and expertise in humanitarian crises such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the Myanmar cyclone of 2008, the genocide in Darfur, the escalating violence in Georgia and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

*When millions of Jews in Eastern Europe and Palestine faced starvation in the wake of the First World War, JDC fed the hungry, provided medical care to the ailing, and supported programs to help stabilize the region&#x27;s fragile economy.
*With the rise of Hitler&#x27;s Nazi regime, JDC supported efforts that enabled 110,000 Jews to leave Germany prior to 1939.
*After the establishment of the state of Israel, JDC supported tens of thousands of Jews as they made the difficult transition from refugee status to citizenship.
* JDC played a central role in Operation Solomon, which airlifted more than 14,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in the span of 36 hours.

===Agro-Joint===
In the 1920s, the Soviet government wanted to control the JDC and how it was working with the Jews living in the Soviet Union. The JDC had agreed to work with an organization known as the Jewish Public Committee, which was controlled by the Bolsheviks. By agreeing to do this, the JDC was able to assist Jews, while being supervised by the Bolsheviks, which appeased the Soviet Union.

World War I plunged Eastern Europe into chaos and subjected Jewish communities across the region to intense poverty, famine, and inflamed anti-Semitism. The Russian Revolution and other subsequent conflicts fanned the flames further, and pleas for JDC&#x27;s humanitarian intervention increased. Therefore, the Soviet Union allowed the JDC to work with the American Relief Aid (ARA), instead of the Jewish Public Committee, in order to help those living in famine. This went on from 1921 to 1923, and during this time the JDC and ARA were able to use nearly $4 million to feed 2 million people in both Belorussia and Ukraine.

The JDC went further to improve conditions for the Jews living in Ukraine by bringing 86 tractors from America to Ukraine. They used these tractors to help reconstruct Jewish agricultural colonies. Many of these colonies in which Jews were living had been destroyed during the war, and were not of optimal living conditions. Furthermore, Dr Joseph Rosen, the director of the Russian branch of the JDC, devised a plan to further assist Jews living in shtetls, Jewish towns where the majority of the population speaks Yiddish.

The communist leadership outlawed businesses upon which Jews were largely dependent, forcing families into poverty. All of these acts lead the creation of the American Jewish Joint Agricultural Corporation (Agro-Joint), in 1924. JDC appointed a New York lawyer, James N. Rosenberg, to head its European Executive Council and oversee Agro-Joint operations. He was later named President of the American Society for Jewish Farm Settlements in Russia, Inc.

One innovation was the establishment of loan &quot;kassas&quot;, cooperative credit institutions that issued low interest loans to Jewish craftsmen and small business owners. From 1924 until 1938, the capital from &quot;kassa&quot; loans help revitalize villages and towns throughout Eastern Europe.

With the support of the Soviet government, JDC pushed forward with this bold initiative to settle so-called “nonproductive” Jews as farmers on vast agricultural settlements in Ukraine, Belarus, and Crimea, as well as an attempt to grant Soviet Jews autonomy in Crimea. A special public organization, the &quot;Society for Settling Toiling Jews on the Land&quot;, or OZET, was established in the Soviet Union for this purpose; it functioned from 1925 to 1938. There was also a special government committee set up, called &quot;Komzet&quot;. Its function was to contribute and distribute the land for the Jewish collective farms, and to work jointly with OZET. The United States delivered updated agricultural equipment to the Jewish colonies in the USSR. The JDC also had agronomists teach the Jewish colonists how to do agricultural work. This helped over 150,00 Jews and improved over 250 settlements. The number of Jewish peasants was greatly reduced because unemployment was down and the colonies were more successful.

Agro-Joint was also active, during these years, in helping with the resettlement of refugee Jewish doctors from Germany.

The success of the Agro-Joint initiative would turn tragic just two years later. Joseph Stalin&#x27;s government had grown increasingly hostile to foreign organizations. Agro-Joint worker soon became targets for Stalinist purges under the National Operations of the NKVD. Operational Order No. 00439, entitled “On the Arrest of German Subjects Suspected of Espionage against the USSR” was issued on July 25, 1937, and mandated the arrest of current and former German citizens who had taken up Soviet citizenship. Later in the year, the order was expanded to include others suspected of collaborating or spying for Germany. Agro-Joint workers, and the doctors it had helped to resettle, became targets. Many of those who assisted in Agro-Joint - including its 17 staff - were arrested, were accused of espionage and counterrevolutionary activities, and were killed.

By 1941, all the settlers who had not already fled were killed by the Nazis.

The JDC during The Great Depression

During October 1929, the Great Depression began in America, and most American citizens began to face a financial hardship. Shortly after, the JDC felt the effect of the Great Depression. Their funding began to dwindle, as people had a hard time donating money to the organization. Due to their lessened resources, the JDC focused its efforts on the Jews who remained in Germany. In addition to their financial difficulties, Nazis pillaged the JDC European headquarters, which caused them to move their headquarters from Berlin to Paris. Despite the continuing depression in America, American Jews began to donate more money to the JDC as they became more aware of the grave situation and danger that their fellow Jews were in. During these seven years, 1933–1939, in which America was in the Great Depression, the JDC was able to aid over 190,000 Jews in their escape from a Nazi-occupied Germany. Of the 190,000 Jews, 80,000 were able to escape Europe completely.

===Before World War II===

Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933 was followed closely by passage of Germany&#x27;s Nuremberg Laws, a set of onerous restrictions that stripped Jews of their basic human rights and livelihoods. JDC&#x27;s support became critical to the survival of the Jews. Channeling funds through local Jewish relief organizations, JDC subsidized medical care, schools, vocational training, welfare programs, and early emigration efforts. JDC support would eventually be extended to Jewish communities in Nazi-annexed Austria and occupied Czechoslovakia. It was not long before the escalation of Hitler&#x27;s persecution of the Jews made emigration aid from the JDC a priority. JDC provided emergency aid for stranded refugees; covered travel expenses and landing fees; and secured travel accommodations and all-important visas for countries of refuge.

Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939 and World War II was declared by England and France two days later. This immediately increased the need for help for Jewish emigration. During the period 1933 to the end of 1939, JDC-supported organizations had helped some 110,000 Jews emigrate from Germany; in 1939 alone it helped some 30,000.

The Evian Conference was organized in 1938 to find solutions to the growing Jewish refugee crisis in Nazi Germany. The Dominican Republic and its dictatorial leader Rafael Trujillo agreed to accept 100,000 refugees, the only country, of 32 countries attending the conference, willing to increase their immigration limits. The Dominican Republic Settlement Association, or DORSA, a project of the JDC, was initiated to resettle Jewish refugees from Europe into an agricultural settlement in Sosua, in the Dominican Republic. Leon Falk Jr. served as president of the association from 1941-1942. The first group of refugees arrived at the 26,000 acre colony in Sosua Bay on May 11, 1940. By January 1941, 300 refugees had immigrated to the colony. Falk Jr and his wife Katherine were very active in the association, including sponsoring some of the trips, arranging grants from the Falk Foundation and visiting the colony several times.

By 1940, JDC was still able to help refugees in transit in more than 40 countries. The Joint opened shelters and soup kitchens for thousands of Jewish refugees in Poland, aiding some 600,000 in 1940. It also subsidized hospitals, child care centers, and educational and cultural programs. Even Passover supplies were shipped in. The goal of this was to provide refugees life-sustaining aid while trying to secure permanent refuge for them in the United States, Palestine, and Latin America.

With U.S. entry into the war following Pearl Harbor in December 1941, JDC had to drastically shift gears. No longer permitted to operate legally in enemy countries, JDC representatives exploited a variety of international connections to channel aid to Jews living in desperate conditions in Nazis-controlled areas. Wartime headquarters were set up in neutral Lisbon, Portugal.

From Lisbon, JDC chartered ships and funded rescue missions that successfully moved thousands of refugees out of harm&#x27;s way. Some made it to Shanghai, China, where JDC sponsored a relief program for 15,000 refugees from Central and Eastern Europe. In Europe, JDC directed funds to support 7,000 Jewish children in hiding. The Joint also worked with &quot;Œuvre de secours aux enfants&quot; (OSE) to support and rescue children. For instance, it helped more than 1,000 children emigrate to Switzerland and Spain. Other children fled to America, with help from the Joint and other organizations, such as HIAS. Many of those children who were able to make it to America came without parents, making them part of the &quot;One Thousand Children&quot; (OTC).

===American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the MS &quot;St. Louis&quot;===

On May 13, 1939, the ocean liner left Germany and headed to Havana, Cuba. On the ship, there were 937 passengers, most of which were Jews fleeing Nazi-occupied Germany. Nearly all the Jewish passengers had applied for U.S. visas and planned to stay in Cuba only until they obtained their visas. However, the Cuban government &quot;revoked&quot; the Cuban visas, and only granted entry to Cuba to 28 of the 937 passengers. Furthermore, the U.S. refused to provide entry visas to America.

Once this news reached Europe and the United States, an attorney, Lawrence Berenson, who worked with the Jewish Joint Distribution Committee decided to intervene on behalf of the passengers being denied entry to Cuba. During this time, the JDC was striving to help Jewish immigrants find a home, so the goal of Berenson was to help these passengers find a home. Berenson met and negotiated with Cuban President Federico Laredo Brú; however the negotiations were unsuccessful. On June 2, Bru demanded the St. Louis leave Cuban waters. The ship sailed close to Florida&#x27;s borders, and asked President Roosevelt to grant them access into the United States. They never received a response. The ship returned to Europe and the JDC continued to negotiate on behalf of the passengers. Morris C. Troper as well as other individuals of the JDC appealed to European governments to secure entry visas for those with nowhere to go.

Due to the efforts of the JDC, 288 passengers were admitted to Great Britain, 181 to the Netherlands, 214 to Belgium, and 224 to France. When the Nazis overran the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, those passengers who had been admitted by those countries were at risk. A total of 254 of these &quot;St. Louis&quot; passengers were killed in the Holocaust. Due to the JDC active efforts and connections, JDC was able to save most of the Jewish passengers aboard the &quot;St. Louis&quot;.

===The Holocaust===

During the Holocaust, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee was the main financial benefactor towards Jewish emigration from Europe and rescue attempts of Jews from Nazi-controlled territories. From the outbreak of World War II through 1944, JDC made it possible for more than 81,000 Jews to emigrate out of Nazi-occupied Europe to safety. JDC also smuggled aid to Jewish prisoners in labor camps and helped finance the Polish Jewish underground in preparations for the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto revolt. In addition, JDC was a major channel keeping American Jewish leaders informed—often in detail—about the holocaust.

=== Post World War II Rescue of Holocaust Survivors ===
Allied victory offered no guarantee that the tens of thousands of newly liberated Jews (Sh&#x27;erit ha-Pletah) would survive to enjoy the fruits of freedom. To stave off mass starvation, JDC marshaled its resources, instituting an ambitious purchasing and shipping program to provide urgent necessities for Holocaust survivors facing critical local shortages. More than 227 million pounds of food, medicine, clothing, and other supplies were shipped to Europe from U.S. ports.

By late 1945, 75,000 Jewish survivors of the Nazi horrors had crowded into hastily set up displaced person camps throughout Germany, Austria, and Italy. Conditions were abominable. Earl Harrison, dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, asked Joseph Schwartz, JDC&#x27;s European director, to accompany him on his official tour of the camps. His landmark report called for separate Jewish camps and for United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) participation in administering them—with JDC&#x27;s help. In response, Schwartz virtually re-created JDC, putting together a field organization that covered Europe and later North Africa and designing a more proactive operational strategy.

Supplementing the relief supplied by the army, by UNRRA, and by UNRRA&#x27;s successor agency—the International Refugee Organization—JDC distributed emergency aid, but also fed the educational and cultural needs of the displaced, providing typewriters, books, Torah scrolls, ritual articles, and holiday provisions. JDC funds were directed at restoring a sense of community and normalcy in the camps with new medical facilities, schools, synagogues, and cultural activities. Over the next two years, the influx of refugees from all over Central and Eastern Europe would more than triple the number of Jews in the DP camps. Their number included Polish Jews who had returned from their wartime refuge in the Soviet Union only to flee once again (westward, this time) from renewed anti-Semitism and pogroms.

During the immediate post-war period, the JDC also worked closely with organizations focused on Jewish cultural property (much of it heirless), such as the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction and the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization.

At the same time, JDC was helping sustain tens of thousands of Jews who remained in Eastern Europe, as well as thousands of others living in the West outside the DP camps in Jewish communities also receiving reconstruction assistance from JDC. In 1946, an estimated 120,000 Jews in Hungary, 65,000 in Poland, and more than half of Romania&#x27;s 380,000 Jews, depended on JDC for food and other basic needs. By 1947, JDC was supporting 380 medical facilities across the continent, and some 137,000 Jewish children were receiving some form of JDC aid.

Falling victim to Cold War tensions, JDC was expelled from Romania, Poland, and Bulgaria in 1949, from Czechoslovakia in 1950, and from Hungary in 1953.

===Resettlement in Israel===
The time came for JDC to shift its focus in Europe from emergency relief to long-term rehabilitation. A large part of its evolving mission involved preparing the Jewish refugee population for new lives in Palestine, soon to be the Jewish state of Israel. Vocational training and &quot;hachsharot&quot; (agricultural training) centers were established for this purpose.

The goal of resettlement carried its own hurdles. Since before the war, Palestine had been under control of Great Britain, which severely restricted the immigration of Europe&#x27;s Jewish refugees. Clandestine immigration went on in spite of the blockades, largely because of the work of &quot;Bricha&quot; and &quot;Aliyah Bet&quot;, two organized movements partially financed and supplied by JDC. When the British began interning illegal Jewish immigrants in detention camps on Cyprus, JDC furnished medical, educational, and social services for the detainees.

Britain&#x27;s eventual withdrawal from Palestine set the stage for the May 15, 1948, birth of the State of Israel, which quickly drew waves of Jews not only from Europe, but from across the Arab world. North Africa became an especially dangerous place for Jews following World War II. 
Jews in Libya suffered a devastating pogrom in 1945.
The 1948 Arab–Israeli War in Palestine set off a wave of nationalist fervor in the region, leading to anti-Jewish riots in Aden, Morocco, and Tripoli. Nearly the entire Jewish population of Libya, 31,000 persons, immigrated to Israel within a few years. The JDC and Israel organized Operation Magic Carpet, the June 1948 airlift of 50,000 Yemenite Jews to Israel. In all, more than 300,000 Jews left North Africa for Israel. Thousands more Iraqi and Kurdish Jews were transported through Operation Ezra, also funded by JDC.

The influx was so massive—and the capacity of the newborn nation to provide for its burgeoning citizenry so limited—that the dream of statehood could have died before it had taken root. Among the new arrivals were 100,000 veterans of Europe&#x27;s DP camps, less than half able-bodied adults. The remainder included the aged, sick, or disabled survivors of concentration camps. Tuberculosis was rampant.

The Israeli government in late 1949 invited JDC to join with the Jewish Agency for Israel to confront these challenges. The outcome was MALBEN—a Hebrew acronym for Organization for the Care of Handicapped Immigrants. Over the next few years, MALBEN rushed to convert former British Army barracks and any other available building into hundreds of hospitals, homes for the aged, TB sanitariums, sheltered workshops, and rehabilitation centers. MALBEN also funded the training of nurses and rehabilitation workers.

By 1951, JDC assumed full responsibility for MALBEN. Its many rehabilitation programs opened new worlds to the disadvantaged, enabling them to contribute to the building of the new country. At the same time, Israel&#x27;s local and national government agencies were building capacity. With the need for emergency aid receding, by the end of the decade, JDC developed more long-term community-based programs aimed at Israel&#x27;s most vulnerable citizens. In the coming years, JDC would become a social catalyst by encouraging and guiding collaborations between the Israeli government and private agencies to identify, evaluate, and address unmet needs in Israeli society.

=== Social welfare ===
As its record of accomplishment in Israel makes clear, JDC helped Israel develop social welfare methods and policy, with many of its programs having served as models for government and non-governmental agencies around the world. In the 1950s, institutional care for the aged was replaced whenever practicable with JDC initiatives that enabled older people to live at home in their communities. The Ministry of Health was established in collaboration with the Psychiatric Trust Fund to develop modern, integrated mental health services and to train qualified staff. The Paul Baerwald School of Social Work, first created by JDC in France to train professionals working with refugees from many diverse cultures, was reestablished at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to professionalize social services.

JDC&#x27;s social work innovations continued into the 1960s with the founding of Israel&#x27;s first Child Development and Assessment Center, which put into practice the then-emerging idea that early detection and treatment optimize outcomes for children with disabilities. A success, Child Development Centers soon spread across the country.

JDC during this period also worked closely with Israeli voluntary agencies that served children with physical and mental disabilities, helping them set up therapy programs, kindergartens, day centers, counseling services for parents, and summer camps. It also advised these organizations on fundraising strategies to help them become financially independent.

In 1969, JDC and the government of Israel inaugurated ESHEL—the Association for the Planning and Development of Services for the Aged—to extend a network of coordinated local, regional, and national services to underserved elderly. Still active today, ESHEL is credited with improving the quality of life of Israel&#x27;s seniors.

With these and other like-minded projects, JDC underwent an important transition with regard to its role in Israel. Initially engaged by the government to provide emergency aid to a traumatized and impoverished population of former refugees, JDC had redirected its efforts toward advising and subsidizing a broad spectrum of community based public and volunteer service providers. The evolution was a reflection of a new reality: Israel had come into its own as a nation and had successfully achieved an infrastructure with the capacity to address the needs of its most vulnerable citizens.

By the end of 1975, JDC had transferred its MALBEN facilities to the government and divested itself of all direct services.

===Diaspora work===
The 1980s and 1990s saw JDC expand both its reach and the scope of its mission. Under the banner of “Rescue, Relief, and Renewal,” the organization responded to the challenges that faced Jewish communities around the world, its emphasis on building the capacity of local partners to be self-sustaining.

The thawing of the Cold War and subsequent break up of the Soviet Union yielded a formal invitation from Mikhail Gorbachev for JDC&#x27;s return to the region in 1989; 50 years after Joseph Stalin brutally expelled the organization, killing several JDC members in the process. The former Soviet Union and its largely isolated and destitute community of elderly Jewish populations quickly became—and remain—the organization&#x27;s priority. A growing network of &quot;Heseds&quot;, or Hesed (FSU Jewish Community Welfare Centers), that JDC helped establish in local communities provided welfare assistance to a peak caseload of 250,000 elderly Jews. According to a JDC publication, &quot;The first Hesed Center was established in 1993 in St. Petersburg by Dr. Amos Avgar of the AJJDC.&quot; Dr. Avgar began developing the Hesed Model in 1992 while leading a work of experts who sought to create &quot;a multi-functional service model.&quot; It was Avgar who set the foundations of the Hesed Model that operates according to three main principles: Jewish values, community orientation, and voluntarism. Hesed Centers have left a profound impact on both Jewish communities and on non-Jewish circles in the FSU. To publicly and formally acknowledge this impact, the Russian Academy of Languages added in March 2000 the Hebrew word &quot;Hesed&quot; (хесед) to the Russian language. Today, the Hesed Community Welfare Centers is still serving 168,000 of the world&#x27;s poorest Jews in the former Soviet Union (December 2008).

JDC has also been instrumental in the rescue of Jews fleeing famine, violence, and other dangers around the world. The saga of Ethiopia&#x27;s Jews was perhaps the most dramatic, culminating in Operation Solomon, the massive 36-hour airlift of 14,000 Jews from Addis Ababa to Israel on May 24 and 25, 1991, just as the city was about to come under rebel attack. JDC assisted in the negotiation and planning of that rescue effort, which came on the heels of the comprehensive health and welfare program it had been operating for the thousands of Jews who had gathered in Addis Ababa in preparation for the departure.

Equally compelling were the 11 rescue convoys that JDC operated from war-ravaged Sarajevo during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The convoys succeeded in transporting 2,300 Serbs, Croats, Muslims, and Jews to safety in other parts of the former Yugoslavia and beyond. JDC also supported the Sarajevo Jewish community&#x27;s non-sectarian relief efforts in that besieged city, and helped the Belgrade community assist the many Jews affected by Serbia&#x27;s economic difficulties as UN-mandated trade sanctions took a growing toll.

Wherever JDC has become active, emergency aid has gone hand-in-hand with local institution-building for the long term. In India, home to an indigenous &quot;Bene Israel&quot; community, JDC in the 1960s channeled funding to the rehabilitation of local schools and included support for food programs and capital upgrades. It also helped underwrite tuition for teachers and student leaders to study in Israel. In Latin America, where Jews fleeing the Nazis had settled decades earlier (with JDC&#x27;s assistance), the organization in the late ’80s created Leatid, a program that trains local lay and professional Jewish leaders to ensure that communities are self-sustaining.

The formalization of JDC&#x27;s non-sectarian work under its International Development Program in 1986 marked another milestone. While JDC had always offered assistance to non-Jews in crisis since the organization&#x27;s founding in 1914, the formation of the new program was done to ensure a unified Jewish response to global disasters—both natural and manmade—on behalf of U.S. and foreign Jewish agencies. Since then, JDC relief and recovery efforts have assisted tens of thousands of people left vulnerable in the wake of the mid-90s civil war in Rwanda, the Kosovo refugee crisis, the devastating 1999 earthquake in Turkey, and the 2004 tsunami in South Asia. As in its Jewish-specific projects, JDC&#x27;s non-sectarian work includes both emergency disaster relief and the building of local institutional capacity to ensure that people at risk continue to be served long after the disaster has passed.

==21st century operations==
JDC has operated in 85 countries at one time or another in the course of its 100-year history. As of early 2009, JDC is conducting projects in 71 countries, including Argentina, Croatia, Ethiopia, Poland, Morocco, Cuba, and throughout the former Soviet Union. JDC also maintains a focus on Israel and has been a humanitarian presence in the Middle East since its founding in 1914.

=== JDC Entwine ===
JDC Entwine, the young adult leadership platform of JDC, was launched in 2007 under the name JDC Next Gen, with the goal of empowering young Jewish leaders to continue JDC&#x27;s legacy. According to their website, &quot;Entwine is a one-of-a-kind movement for young Jewish leaders, influencers, and advocates who seek to make a meaningful impact on global Jewish needs and international humanitarian issues.&quot; The name comes from a quote by JDC leader and Honorary Executive Vice President Ralph I. Goldman: &quot;There is a single Jewish world: intertwined, interconnected”.

Entwine engages Jewish young professionals and college students through its annual series of overseas immersive experiences (Insider Trips), Multi-Week Services Corps, and year-long Jewish Service Corps Fellowship (JSC).

===Partners===
In its mission to support communities in developing their own resources in ways that are both culturally sensitive and organic, JDC partners with local organizations in creating and implementing all JDC projects worldwide. These partnerships enable JDC to most effectively address the unique needs of the communities where it operates and to build the capacity of all of the institutions, professionals, and volunteers so they become equipped with the skills needed to serve their own communities.

===Programs and priorities===
Relief, Rescue, Renewal –Aiding Jewry Worldwide is JDC&#x27;s mission to alleviate suffering and enhance the lives of Jews has taken it across geographic, cultural, and political borders on five continents. Currently, the regions drawing the greatest amount of JDC effort include the following:

*The Former Soviet Union. The upheaval caused by the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought both crisis and opportunity to Jews living there. All religions and minorities suffered under communism, and so fractured communities of Jews were suddenly confronted with a collapsed infrastructure and an uncertain future, but also the hope that it might now be possible to assert and reclaim a heritage long denied them. JDC, which had only recently begun to reestablish a presence in the region after being violently expelled by Stalin in 1938, poured its resources into the relief, rescue, and restoration of Jewish populations fighting for survival. Today, JDC provides food, medical care, home care, and winter relief to 168,000 elderly Jews, largely through 175 &quot;Hesed&quot; welfare centers throughout the region. JDC also provides nutritional, medical, and other assistance to 25,000 children at risk and their families. In addition to life-sustaining aid, JDC helps Jews reclaim their heritage and build vibrant self-sustaining Jewish communities through Jewish Community Centers, libraries, youth centers, family retreats, Jewish education, and local leadership development.
*Central and Eastern Europe. As in the former Soviet Union, social and economic shifts threaten the stability of the many diverse Jewish communities throughout Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries. JDC&#x27;s social welfare and community development approaches are as varied as the communities they assist. JDC relief programs for Holocaust survivors reach 26,000 elderly, while the organization works with local partners to ensure that impoverished children&#x27;s basic needs are met. The overarching goal is self-sustainability and shifting welfare responsibilities to local entities. To achieve this, JDC provides consultation to communities in the areas of leadership training, strategic planning, fundraising, property management, and networking, helping local professionals to develop the skills to serve the larger community.
*Africa and Asia. It terms of sheer numbers, Jewish communities in Africa and the Far East range from sizable (upwards of 14,000 in Turkey) to small (as of this writing, Algeria is home to only a handful of Jews, because of the Islamist governments of the 1990s). Jewish populations on both continents are diminishing, either through emigration or because the elderly are all that remain. But wherever there is a Jew and a desire to maintain the trappings and traditions of Jewish life, JDC strives to ensure that basic needs are met and Jewish institutions continue. JDC supports local Jewish education and training efforts and puts special emphasis on international programs that bridge isolated Jewish populations with Jews all over the world.
*The Americas. There are nearly a quarter million Jews in Argentina, more than in any other nation in the Western hemisphere after the United States. That number included a vibrant, emerging middle class. But much of that progress was thrown in turmoil by a nationwide financial crisis in 2001 that plunged thousands into economic despair and entrenched the pull of poverty for those already living in it. JDC responded, providing critical assistance to 36,000 Argentine Jews. Since then, JDC has begun to cede its assistance role to its local partners while continuing to ensure that basic food and medical needs of the most vulnerable citizens are met.
*Israel. JDC&#x27;s relationship with Israel is unique. While the organization works with the cooperation of the governments of other nations where it has a presence, with Israel the relationship is more of a direct partnership. Working together, JDC and the Israeli government strengthen the capacity of local agencies to address the immediate and long-term needs of the elderly, at-risk youth, the chronically under employed, and new immigrants. JDC assists in building and maintaining Israel&#x27;s social strengths—including management of the public sector, governance and management of nonprofit organizations, volunteerism, and philanthropy—so that the society as a whole is more able to meet its own needs. JDC also helps those Jews and non-Jews living under fire in southern Israel.

== JDC Israel ==
In 1976, JDC Global established JDC Israel (also known as &quot;The Joint&quot;, ) with its headquarters in Jerusalem. Since then, JDC Israel has been developing programs and services for Israel&#x27;s most vulnerable populations through its partnerships with the Israeli government, associations and non-profit organizations. JDC Israel operates through several departments:

*ASHALIM – Advancing Social Mobility
*ELKA – System Efficiency and Effectiveness
*ESHEL – Optimal Aging
*Israel Unlimited – Independent Living for People with Disabilities
*TEVET – Workforce Integration and Productivity

==Institutions==
In the course of its long history, JDC has helped create lasting institutions that do much of the research and policy development that inform JDC programs and advance its goals. In fact, the work of the institutions is highly regarded well beyond the Jewish community and can arguably be said to have raised the bar on social service delivery, globally.

===Public policy making===
The Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute, a partnership between the JDC, the Government of Israel, and the David and Inez Myers Foundation, was established in 1974. Its role is to conduct applied social research on the scope and causes of social needs, specifically those related to aging, health policy, children and youth, people with disabilities, employment, and quality in the social services, and assesses various approaches to addressing them. The information produced by researchers has proven a powerful tool for Israel&#x27;s policy makers and social service practitioners. Among other examples, MJB researchers:

*Revealed the dramatic increase in the number of Israel&#x27;s disabled elderly and helped develop strategies to expand community services for them.
*Helped to expand and improve national education policy for Ethiopian children in the 1990s, which resulted in improved high school achievements and greater participation in higher education.
*Facilitated the implementation of Israel&#x27;s Special Education Law, which markedly expanded services for disabled children in the 1990s.
*Helped to introduce and effectively implement the National Health Insurance Law (1995), which provides universal and more equitable coverage to all of Israel&#x27;s citizens.

Other JDC-affiliated institutions include The Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel, an independent think tank that analyzes and develops social policy alternatives, and the recently established JDC International Centre for Community Development, which supports JDC&#x27;s efforts worldwide to enhance and support Jewish communal life.

===Training===
Leadership training is a JDC core value. To that end, JDC founded Leatid, the European center for Jewish leadership. The Leatid training program, with its focus on management and community planning, helps expand the pool of outstanding professional Jewish men and women committed to the continued well being of their communities. Jewish leaders from all parts of Europe have taken part in Leatid training seminars, including most of the current presidents of European Jewish communities, executive directors, key board members and rabbis. Indeed, those leaders who aren&#x27;t Leatid alumnus almost certainly underwent Buncher Community Leadership Training, another JDC effort in partnership with the Buncher Family Foundation and the United Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh. Since its start in 1989, Buncher Leadership Training has conducted seminars in the former Soviet Union, the Baltic States, Poland, Germany, Former Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria as well as India and Latin America.

Finally, the Moscow NGO Management School, founded by JDC in 2005, effectively strengthens the Russian nonprofit sector by providing professional training to managers of nonprofit organizations. The curriculum is crafted to provide opportunities for nonprofit leaders to gain skills to help their organizations succeed.

===Disaster relief===
JDC&#x27;s role as a non-sectarian disaster relief agency is motivated by the spirit of &quot;tikkun olam&quot;, the traditional moral obligation of Jews to improve conditions for the entire human family. Working with local partners, JDC has provided emergency aid and long-term development assistance to communities devastated by such catastrophic events as the Kashmir earthquake in 2005, and the South Asia tsunami in 2004. More recent relief efforts include:

*2008 Ziarat earthquake. On October 29, 2008, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck southwest Pakistan, northeast of the provincial capital Quetta. JDC collected funds to directly assist victims of the quake and partnered with the International Blue Crescent to deliver much-need food, bedding, hygiene kits, and warm clothing to those hardest hit.
*Russia-Georgia conflict. Following the eruption of hostilities on August 7, 2008, JDC partnered with the Georgian Red Cross and MASHAV, the Center for International Development of Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to coordinate the shipment and deployment of critical medical supplies and other emergency assistance. JDC continues to assess the needs of the region and develop a strategy for long-term assistance to those displaced by the conflict.
*2008 China earthquake. China&#x27;s worst earthquake in more than 30 years devastated Sichuan and eight additional provinces on May 12, 2008, killing more than 70,000 people and leaving 1.39 million homeless. JDC is supporting a partnership between The All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives (ACFSMC) and the Negev Institute for Strategies of Peace and Development (NISPED) that is leading an ambitious reconstruction effort in the region.
*2008 Myanmar cyclone. JDC was among the only aid organizations to enter Myanmar&#x27;s Irrawaddy Delta following Cyclone Nargis, which struck on May 2, 2008. The disaster affected an estimated 2.4 million people. JDC coordinated with other nongovernmental organizations to immediately provide water, food, and medical supplies and is now supporting efforts to rebuild schools, homes, and embankments destroyed by the cyclone.
*April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that had devastated the country of Nepal, the JDC is looking to leverage its expert disaster response team and coordinate with the local authorities in order to assess the situation and provide for survivors&#x27; needs. They are aiming to bring medical supplies, distribute shelter supplies, food kits and oral rehydration salts as well as address the needs of children, providing them with shelter, water and nutrition.

<doc id="727196" wikidata="Q7686763" url="?curid=727196" title="Tarski monster group">
<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, a Tarski monster group, named for Alfred Tarski, is an infinite group &quot;G&quot;, such that every proper subgroup &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, other than the identity subgroup, is a cyclic group of order a fixed prime number &quot;p&quot;. A Tarski monster group is necessarily simple. It was shown by Alexander Yu. Olshanskii in 1979 that Tarski groups exist, and that there is a Tarski &quot;p&quot;-group for every prime &quot;p&quot; &gt; 1075. They are a source of counterexamples to conjectures in group theory, most importantly to Burnside&#x27;s problem and the von Neumann conjecture.

==Definition==
Let formula_1 be a fixed prime number. An infinite group formula_2 is called a Tarski monster group for formula_1 if every nontrivial subgroup (i.e. every subgroup other than 1 and G itself) has formula_1 elements.

==Properties==
* formula_2 is necessarily finitely generated. In fact it is generated by every two non-commuting elements.
* formula_2 is simple. If formula_7 and formula_8 is any subgroup distinct from formula_9 the subgroup formula_10 would have formula_11 elements.
* The construction of Olshanskii shows in fact that there are continuum-many non-isomorphic Tarski Monster groups for each prime formula_12.
* Tarski monster groups are examples of non-amenable groups not containing any free subgroups.

<doc id="727199" wikidata="Q905449" url="?curid=727199" title="The Midwich Cuckoos">
<text>The Midwich Cuckoos is a 1957 science fiction novel written by the English author John Wyndham. It tells the tale of an English village in which the women become pregnant by brood parasitic aliens. The book has been praised by many critics, including the dramatist Dan Rebellato, who called it &quot;a searching novel of moral ambiguities&quot;, and the novelist Margaret Atwood, who called the book Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The book has been adapted into several media, such as film, radio, and television.

==Plot==
Ambulances arrive at two traffic accidents blocking the only roads into the English village of Midwich, Winshire. Attempting to approach the village, one ambulance-man becomes unconscious. Suspecting gas poisoning, the army is notified. They discover that a caged canary becomes unconscious upon entering the affected region, but regains consciousness when removed. Further experiments reveal the region to be a hemisphere with a diameter of around the village. Aerial photography shows an unidentifiable silvery object on the ground in the centre of the affected zone.

After one day, the effect vanishes, along with the unidentified object and the villagers wake with no apparent ill effects. Some months later they realise that every woman of child-bearing age is pregnant with all indications that the pregnancies were caused by xenogenesis during the period of unconsciousness that has come to be referred to as the &quot;Dayout&quot;.

When the 31 boys and 30 girls are born, they appear normal, except for their unusual golden eyes, light blonde hair and pale, silvery skin. The children have none of the genetic characteristics of their mothers. As they grow up, it becomes increasingly apparent that they are not completely human. They possess telepathic abilities and can control others&#x27; actions. The Children (they are referred to with a capital &quot;C&quot;) have two distinct group minds, one for the boys and another for the girls. Their physical development is accelerated compared with that of humans; upon reaching the age of nine, they appear to be sixteen-year-olds.

The Children protect themselves as much as possible using a form of mind control. One young man who accidentally clips a Child on the hip with his car is made to drive into a wall and kill himself. A bull that chased the Children is forced into a pond to drown. The villagers form a mob and try to burn down the Midwich Grange (a farm where the Children are taught and live) but the Children make the villagers attack each other.

The Military Intelligence department learns that the same phenomenon has occurred in four other parts of the world, including an Inuit settlement in the Canadian Arctic, a small township in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory, a Mongolian village and the town of Gizhinsk in eastern Russia, north-east of Okhotsk. The Inuit killed the newborn Children, sensing they were not their own and the Mongolians killed both Children and mothers. The Australian babies had all died within a few weeks, suggesting that something may have gone wrong with the xenogenesis process. The Russian town was recently &quot;accidentally&quot; destroyed by the Soviet government, using an atomic cannon from a range of .

The Children are aware of the danger and use their power to prevent aeroplanes from flying over the village. During an interview with a Military Intelligence officer, the Children explain that to solve the problem they must be destroyed. They explain it is not possible to kill them unless the entire village is bombed, which would result in civilian deaths. The Children present an ultimatum, they want to migrate to a secure location where they can live unharmed. They demand aeroplanes from the government.

An elderly, educated, Midwich resident, named Gordon Zellaby, realises the Children must be killed as soon as possible. As he has only a few weeks left to live due to a heart condition, he feels obliged to do something. He has acted as a teacher of and mentor to the Children and they regard him with as much affection as they can have for any human, permitting him to approach them more closely than others. One evening, he hides a bomb in his projection equipment while showing the Children a film about the Greek islands. Zellaby sets off the bomb, killing himself and all of the Children.

==Cuckoos==
The &quot;cuckoo&quot; in the novel&#x27;s title alludes to a family of birds, of which nearly 60 species are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds. These species are obligate brood parasites, only reproducing in this way, the best-known example being the Eurasian cuckoo. The cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the host&#x27;s, and the cuckoo chick grows faster; in most cases the chick evicts the eggs or young of the host species, while encouraging the host to keep pace with its high growth rate.

==Reception==
The &quot;Galaxy&quot; columnist Floyd C. Gale, reviewing the original issue in 1958, praised the novel as &quot;a most off-trail and well-written invasion yarn.&quot; Thomas M. Wagner of &quot;SFReviews.net&quot; concluded in 2004 that the novel &quot;remains a cracking good read despite some obviously dated elements.&quot; Damon Knight, however, wrote in 1967 that Wyndham&#x27;s novelistic treatment &quot;is deadly serious, and I&#x27;m sorry to say, deadly dull ... about page 90 the story begins to bog down under layers of polite restraint, sentimentality, lethargy and women&#x27;s-magazine masochism, and it never lifts its head long again.&quot; The writer Christina Hardyment, writing in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2008, commented that the book packed even more of a punch in an age of &quot;genetic experimentation&quot; than it had done in the 1950s.

===Dan Rebellato===
The dramatist Dan Rebellato, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010, called Wyndham probably the most successful British science fiction author since H. G. Wells and his books so familiar that people do not study them closely. In Rebellato&#x27;s view, &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; was, on rereading, &quot;a searching novel of moral ambiguities where once I&#x27;d seen only an inventive but simple SF thriller&quot;, a book that questioned the assumptions of its narrator character. It dealt, he argued, with the struggle between men and women at least as much as between people and aliens, touching on rape, abortion, childbirth and motherhood, with a subtext a great deal more subtle than the narrator&#x27;s brusque story. Rebellato observed, too, that Wyndham was writing in the 1950s under the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s censorship for obscenity, so his use of &quot;misdirection, subtext, irony and ambiguity&quot; were necessary to allow publication of his discussion of sexuality. Rebellato addresses, too, the New Wave science fiction writer Brian Aldiss&#x27;s criticism of Wyndham&#x27;s books as &quot;cosy catastrophes&quot;; in Rebellato’s view, the stories may look like that but they are &quot;surprisingly unheroic&quot; and often open-ended, while underneath they are &quot;very uncosy, persistently unsettling&quot;, asking profound questions about the limits of Western culture.

===Margaret Atwood===
The novelist Margaret Atwood, writing in &quot;Slate&quot; in 2015, commented that in her opinion, &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; was John Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, selling very well, &quot;cozy catastrophes&quot; or not, though she observed that &quot;one might as well call World War II—of which Wyndham was a veteran—a &#x27;cozy&#x27; war because not everyone died in it&quot;. She noted, too, that just like the children in &quot;The Chrysalids&quot;, the cuckoo children use their special abilities to help each other and that Wyndham never made up his mind on the moral question of whether it would be a good thing to know what other people were thinking.

==Cancelled sequel==
Wyndham began work on a sequel novel, &quot;Midwich Main&quot;, which he abandoned after only a few chapters.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
====Official====
* &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; (1960), film directed by Wolf Rilla
* &quot;Children of the Damned&quot; (1964), a sequel directed by Anton Leader
* &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; (1995), directed by John Carpenter. It featured Christopher Reeve in his last film role before he was paralysed, and included Kirstie Alley as a government official, in roles similar to the characters of Gordon Zellaby and Colonel Westcott, respectively.

=====Unproduced projects=====
A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer remake to have begun filming during 1981 was cancelled. Christopher Wood was in the midst of writing a script for producer Lawrence P. Bachmann when the Writers Guild of America intervened.

====Unofficial====
* The 1994 Thai movie &quot;Kawao Thi Bang Phleng&quot; (&quot;Blackbirds at Bangpleng&quot;) is arguably based on the novel. The movie was based on a 1989 novel by the Thai writer and politician Kukrit Pramoj, in turn derived from Wyndham&#x27;s book.

===Television===
* &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; (2022), miniseries directed by Alice Troughton, Jennifer Perrott and Börkur Sigþórsson.

===Radio===

<text>A foreign exchange spot transaction, also known as FX spot, is an agreement between two parties to buy one currency against selling another currency at an agreed price for settlement on the spot date. The exchange rate at which the transaction is done is called the spot exchange rate. As of 2010, the average daily turnover of global FX spot transactions reached nearly US$1.5 trillion, counting 37.4% of all foreign exchange transactions. FX spot transactions increased by 38% to US$2.0 trillion from April 2010 to April 2013.

== Settlement date ==

The standard settlement timeframe for foreign exchange spot transactions is T+2; i.e., two business days from the trade date. Notable exceptions are USD/CAD, USD/TRY, USD/PHP, USD/RUB, and offshore USD/KZT and offshore USD/PKR currency pairs, which settle at T+1. USD/COP settles T+0.
 Majority of SME FX payments are made through Spot FX, partially because businesses aren&#x27;t aware of alternatives.

== Execution methods ==

Common methods of executing a spot foreign exchange transaction include the following:

* &quot;Direct&quot; – Executed between two parties directly and not intermediated by a third party. For example, a transaction executed via direct telephone communication or direct electronic dealing systems such as Reuters Conversational Dealing
* &quot;Electronic broking systems&quot; – Executed via automated order matching system for foreign exchange dealers. Examples of such systems are EBS and Reuters Matching 2000/2
* &quot;Electronic trading systems&quot; – Executed via a single-bank proprietary platform or a multibank dealing system. These systems are generally geared towards customers. Examples of multibank systems include Fortex Technologies, Inc., 360TGTX, FXSpotStream LLC, Integral, FXall, HotSpotFX, Currenex, LMAX Exchange, FX Connect, Prime Trade, Globalink, Seamless FX, and eSpeed
* &quot;Voice broker&quot; – Executed via telephone with a foreign exchange voice broker

<doc id="727203" wikidata="Q323500" url="?curid=727203" title="Eburones">
<text>The Eburones (Greek: ) were a Gaulish-Germanic tribe dwelling in the northeast of Gaul, who lived north of the Ardennes in the region near what is now the southern Netherlands, eastern Belgium and the German Rhineland, in the period immediately preceding the Roman conquest of the region. Though living in Gaul, they were also described as being both Belgae and Germani (for a discussion of these terms, see below).

The Eburones played a major role in Julius Caesar&#x27;s account of his &quot;Gallic Wars&quot;, as the most important tribe within the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot; group of tribes — &quot;Germani&quot; living west of the Rhine amongst the Belgae. Caesar claimed that the name of the Eburones was wiped out after their failed revolt against his forces during the Gallic Wars, and that the tribe was largely annihilated. Whether any significant part of the population lived on in the area as Tungri, the tribal name found here later, is uncertain but considered likely.

== Name ==

=== Attestations ===
They are mentioned as &quot;Eburones&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Orosius (early 5th c. AD); as &quot;Eboúrōnes&quot; (Ἐβούρωνες) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD); as &quot;Ebourōnoí&quot; (Ἐβουρωνοί) by Cassius Dio (3rd c. AD).

=== Etymology ===
Most scholars derive the ethnonym &quot;Eburones&quot; from the Gaulish word for &#x27;yew-tree&#x27;, &quot;eburos&quot;, itself stemming from Proto-Celtic &quot;*eburos&quot; (&#x27;yew&#x27;; cf. OIr. &quot;ibar&quot; &#x27;yew&#x27;, MBret. &quot;euor&quot; &#x27;alder buck-thorn&#x27;, MW. &quot;efwr&quot; European &#x27;cow parsnip&#x27;, also known as &#x27;hog-weed&#x27;, &quot;Heracleum sphondylium&quot;). This interpretation is supported by the story, as told by Julius Caesar, of how the Eburonean king Catuvolcus killed himself with poisonous yew in a ritualistic suicide. 

An alternative Germanic etymology from *&quot;eburaz&quot; (&#x27;boar&#x27;; cf. ON &quot;jofurr&quot;, Ger. &quot;Eber&quot;) has also been proposed. Xavier Delamarre points out that coins of the &quot;Aulerci Eburovices&quot;, in Normandy, show the head of a wild boar, and argues that there might have been, further northeast, a &quot;semantic contamination, in the mixed Germano-Celtic Rhenish areas, of the Gaulish &quot;eburos&quot; by the Germanic quasi-homonym &quot;*eburaz&quot;.&quot; Joseph Vendryes saw a Celtic &#x27;boar-god&#x27; &quot;*epro&quot; behind the name of the yew, and it has been noted that the boar and the yew are both associated with concepts of lordship and longevity in the Germanic and—to a lesser extent—Celtic traditions, which may provided a reason for such a &quot;contamination&quot;.

The second part of the ethnonym, &quot;-ones&quot;, is commonly found in both Celtic (Lingones, Senones, etc.) and Germanic (Ingvaeones, Semnones, etc.) tribal names in the Roman era.

Maurits Gysseling has suggested that place names such as Averbode and Avernas (Hannut) might be derived from the Eburones.

==Geography==

=== Territory ===
The Eburones lived in an area broadly situated between the Ardennes and Eifel region in the south, and the Rhine-Meuse delta in the north. Their territory lay east of the Atuatuci (themselves east of the Nervii), south of the Menapii, and north of the Segni and Condrusi (themselves north of the Treveri). To the east, the Sugambri and Ubii were their neighbours on the opposite bank of the Rhine. When the Germanic Tencteri and Usipetes crossed the Rhine from Germania in 55 BC, they first fell on the Menapii and advanced into the territories of the Eburones and Condrusi, who were both &quot;under the protection of&quot; the Treveri to the south.According to a description given by Caesar (mid-1st century BC), the greatest part of the Eburones lived between the Meuse and Rhine rivers. However, Caesar also notes that their land bordered on that of the coastal Menapii in the north, and that those among the Eburones &quot;who were nearest the ocean&quot; managed to hide in islands after their defeat against the Romans. This apparent geographical situation, near both the Condroz region and the Rhine–Meuse delta, has suggested to many scholars that a significant part of their territory stretched west of the Meuse rather than between the Meuse and the Rhine. For instance, Johannes Heinrichs (2008) contends that a territory stretching from the Rhine to the North Sea would be &quot;unrealistically large&quot;, especially since they were portrayed as clients of the neighbouring Atuatuci until 57 BC. Since archaeological findings suggest that the Eburonean territory did not extend substantially east of the Meuse in the direction of the Rhine, Heinrichs argues that their territory was rather principally centred in an area located west of the Meuse.

They have been identified by Belgian archaeologists with a material culture in northern Limburg and the Campine region. According to Edith Wightman (1985), &quot;this would certainly account for the of Eburones and Menapii mentioned by Caesar; the distribution of war-time staters attributed to the Eburones (a mixture of and Treveran elements) also corresponds with this group.&quot; Based on the concentrations of coins, Nico Roymans (2004) has proposed to also regard the eastern half of the Rhine–Meuse delta as part of the Eburonean polity. The area was later inhabited by the Batavians, who likely assimilated the local Eburones in this scenario.

Another part of the Eburones also fled to a remote area of the Ardennes, where Ambiorix himself is said to have gone with some cavalry. Caesar also portrays the Scheldt river (&quot;Scaldis&quot;) as flowing into the Meuse, apparently confusing this river with the Sambre. This has led scholars to argue that Caesar or later copyists sometimes confused river names or used them differently than later writers did. Some scholars have argued for a location in the northern Eifel region, but this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the Condrusi, who gave their name to the Condroz region, are described by Caesar as dwelling between the Treveri and Eburones. Wightman further notes that &quot;no cultural groupings can be isolated to suit the Eburones in the north Eifel&quot;.

=== Settlements ===
Caesar describes Atuatuca as a &quot;castellum&quot; (&#x27;fort, stronghold, shelter&#x27;) located in the middle of the Eburonean territory, which has sometimes been taken to imply that it was between the Meuse and the Rhine rivers where, in another passage, Caesar locates the greatest part of the Eburonean population. The exact location of their stronghold remains uncertain; it is almost certainly not the same as the later Atuatuca Tungrorum, which appears to have been erected &quot;ex-nihilo&quot; as a Roman military base ca. 10 BC. In the words of Wightman, &quot;changes which took place after Caesar, involving new folk from across the Rhine and reorganization of existing peoples, make localization difficult.&quot;

Atuatuca played an important role in the revolt of Ambiorix against Rome in the winter of 54–53 BC, and in Caesar&#x27;s subsequent attempts to annihilate the tribe in 53 and 51 BC. Willy Vanvinckenroye (2001) has suggested that the Eburones did not have their own strongholds and used instead the fortress of the neighbouring Atuatuci to house troops, since they were tributary to them. This would provide any origin for the place name. Both are linguistically related to each other, although the settlement cannot be historically linked to the tribe with certainty.

==History==

=== Gallic Wars ===

==== Battle of the Sabis (57 BC) ====
During the Battle of the Sabis, Caesar&#x27;s forces clashed with an alliance of Belgic tribes in 57 BC. Before that event, information from the Remi, a tribe allied with Rome, reported that the Germani (the Condrusi, Eburones, Caeraesi, and Paemani) had collectively promised to send around 40,000 men. These were to join 60,000 Bellovaci, 50,000 Suessiones, 50,000 Nervii, 15,000 Atrebates, 10,000 Ambiani, 25,000 Morini, 9,000 Menapii, 10,000 Caleti, 10,000 Velocasses, 10,000 Viromandui, and 19,000 Aduatuci. The whole force was led by Galba, king of the Suessiones. However, the alliance did not work. The Suessiones and Bellovaci surrendered after the Romans defended the Remi and then moved towards their lands. And after this the Ambiani offered no further resistance and the Nervii, along with the Atrebates and Viromandui, formed the most important force on the day of the battle. The Eburones are not mentioned specifically in the description of the battle itself, but after the defeat the Eburones became important as one of the tribes continuing to resist Roman overlordship.

==== Siege of Atuatuca (54 BC) ====
In 54 BC, Caesar&#x27;s forces were still in Belgic territory, having just returned from their second expedition to Britain, and needed to be wintered. Crops had not been good, due to a drought, and this imposition upon the communities led to new conflict. This insurrection started only 15 days after a legion and five cohorts (one and a half legions) under the command of Caesar&#x27;s legates, Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta arrived in their winter quarters in the country of the Eburones. The Eburones, encouraged by messages from the Treveran king Indutiomarus, and headed by their two kings, Ambiorix and Cativolcus, attacked the Roman camp; and after inducing the Romans to leave their stronghold on the promise of a safe passage, massacred nearly all of them (approximately 6000 men). Encouraged by this victory, Ambiorix rode personally first to the Aduatuci and then to the Nervi, arguing for a new attack on the Romans wintering in Nervian territory under the command by Quintus Tullius Cicero, brother of the famous orator. The Nervii agreed and summoned forces quickly from several tribes under their government, Centrones, Grudii, Levaci, Pleumoxii, and Geiduni. Caesar reported that this was thwarted by his timely intervention, and the Belgic allies dispersed, Caesar &quot;fearing to pursue them very far, because woods and morasses intervened, and also [because] he saw that they suffered no small loss in abandoning their position&quot;.

In the meantime Labienus, one of Caesar&#x27;s most trusted generals, was wintering in the territory of the Treveri, and also came under threat when news of the Eburones rebellion spread. Eventually, he killed the king of the Treveri, Indutiomarus. &quot;This affair having been known, all the forces of the Eburones and the Nervii which had assembled, depart; and for a short time after this action, Caesar was less harassed in the government of Gaul.&quot; In the following year Caesar entered the country of the Eburones, and Ambiorix fled before him. Cativolcus poisoned himself with a concoction from a yew tree. The country of the Eburones was difficult for the Romans, being woody and swampy in parts. Caesar invited the neighboring people to come and plunder the Eburones, &quot;in order that the life of the Gauls might be hazarded in the woods rather than the legionary soldiers; at the same time, in order that a large force being drawn around them, the race and name of that state may be annihilated for such a crime&quot;. The Sicambri, from east of the Rhine, were one of the main raiders. While Caesar was ravaging the country of the Eburones, he left Quintus Tullius Cicero with a legion to protect the baggage and stores, at a place called Aduatuca, which he tells us, though he had not mentioned the name of the place before, was the place where Sabinus and Cotta had been killed. The plan to take advantage of the Sicambri backfired when the Eburones explained to the Sicambri that the Roman supplies and booty, not the refugees, were the most attractive target for plundering.

==== Genocide (53–51 BC) ====
Caesar reports that he burnt every village and building that he could find in the territory of the Eburones, drove off all the cattle, and his men and beasts consumed all the grain that the weather of the autumnal season did not destroy. He left those who had hid themselves, if there were any, with the hope that they would all die of hunger in the winter. Caesar writes that he wanted to annihilate the Eburones and their name, and indeed the tribe vanished from history after the Gallic wars.

Daniel Chirot and Jennifer Edwards describe the conquest as a genocide, but provide no analysis of the particulars. Studies of settlement evidence suggest a significant demographic decrease in the Eburonean territory after that period, which can be plausibly linked with the Caesarian campaigns. According to Roymans, &quot;several interrelated explanations can be given for the high degree of Roman violence in this region: the absence of urbanised settlements or heavily defended &quot;oppida&quot; that could be used by Caesar as military targets; the employment by Germanic groups of a strategy of decentralised, guerrilla-type warfare; and, of course, Caesar’s intent to revenge the ambush of a Roman army by the leader of the Eburones, Ambiorix.&quot;

Heinrichs argues that the genocide of the Eburones in 53 BC could not realistically have happened as it is claimed by Caesar. If the systematic destruction of infrastructures by the Roman forces was intended to prevent the local people from regaining power, physical extermination likely proved to be impractical. The available areas of refuge hardly accessible to the Roman legions were numerous: the low mountain range of the Ardennes, the swamps and wastelands towards the Menapii, the coastal islands, etc. Moreover, Caesar&#x27;s second attempt to annihilate the tribe two years later demonstrates that the community survived in some way, and even probably regenerated in such a way that further violent actions were apparently needed. According to Roymans, their disappearance from the political map could have resulted from &quot;a policy of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; on the part of the Roman authorities, in combination with the confiscation of Eburonean territory&quot;. A great part of their gold fell into Roman hands during repeated Roman raids on the Eburones in 53–51 BC, and was then melted down and carried off.

=== Roman period ===
After the Gallic Wars, the new tribal entities that settled in the Lower Rhine region with Roman support lived on territories previously occupied by the Eburones. Based on a comment by Tacitus, who identifies the Tungri as descendants of the first group of Germani which crossed the Rhine and drove away the Gauls, some scholars have proposed that remnants of the former Eburonean confederation may have contributed to the ethnic composition of the Tungri. The Batavi, who settled in the Rhine–Meuse delta in the late 1st century BC, may also have merged with remnants of indigenous Eburonean groups that had survived in the area.

Under the Romans, one of the tribes associated with the Tungri, and apparently living in the north of their area (in modern Campine), were the Texuandri. Like the Tungri, they had not been mentioned by Caesar. Similarly to the Condrusi (whom Caesar had mentioned, and who continued to exist under Roman rule), the Texuandri were recognized as a distinct grouping for the administrative purpose of mustering troops.

==Culture==
It is clear that the Belgic tribes of Gaul were culturally influenced by both Gaulish and Germanic neighbours, but the details, for example which languages they spoke, remain uncertain. It is also probable that the Eburones contained both Gallic and Germanic elements. 

=== Classical sources ===

Although the term Germanic has a linguistic definition today, Roman authors such as Caesar and Tacitus did not clearly divide the Celts from what they called the Germans based on languages. On the contrary, both authors tended to emphasize, partly for political reasons, the differences in terms of the levels of civilization which had been attained, with Germanic peoples being considered wilder and less civilized peoples, requiring military and political considerations.

Despite being regarded as Belgae, a type of Gaul, Julius Caesar says that the Condrusi, Eburones, Caeraesi, Paemani, and Segni were called by the collective name of &quot;Germani&quot; and had settled there some time ago, having come from the opposite bank of the Rhine. The Eburones are therefore amongst the so-called &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot; &#x27;Germans on this side of the Rhine&#x27;, i.e. Germanic peoples who lived south and west of the Rhine and may have been distinct from the Belgae.

Tacitus later wrote that it was in this very region that the term &quot;Germani&quot; started to be used, even though he mentions a tribe Caesar did not mention, the Tungri.The name Germany, on the other hand, they say, is modern and newly introduced, from the fact that the tribes which first crossed the Rhine and drove out the Gauls, and are now called Tungrians, were then called Germans [&quot;Germani&quot;]. Thus what was the name of a tribe, and not of a race, gradually prevailed, until all called themselves by this self-invented name of Germans, which the conquerors had first employed to inspire terror. 
This is often interpreted as implying that the Tungri, a name later used to refer to all the tribes of this area, were descendants of several tribes including the ones Caesar said were called &quot;Germani&quot; collectively. The name may even be an artificial name meaning &quot;the sworn ones&quot; or confederates.

=== Language ===
There are clues which are sometimes taken to indicate that the local peoples in former Eburonic territories spoke or adopted Gaulish, or some form of it. One of the basic influences on the pronunciation of Dutch is a Gallo-Romance accent. This means that in the Gallo-Roman period, when the Eburones had officially ceased to exist, the Latin which was then spoken was strongly influenced by a Gaulish substrate.

On the other hand, studies of place names such as those of Maurits Gysseling, have been argued to show evidence of the very early presence of Germanic languages throughout the area north of the Ardennes. The sound changes described by &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Law&quot; appear to have affected names with older forms, seemingly already in the 2nd century BC. It has been argued by some scholars that the older language of the area, though apparently Indo-European, was not Celtic (see Nordwestblock) and therefore that Celtic, though influential amongst the elite, might never have been the language of the area where the Eburones lived.

=== Personal names ===
It is generally accepted that the personal names of Catuvolcus and Ambiorix, the Eburonean kings who opposed Caesar during the Gallic Wars (58–50 BC), are of Celtic origin. The former is most likely the Gaulish compound &quot;catu-uolcus&quot; (&#x27;war-falcon&#x27;), formed with the stem &quot;catu-&quot; (&#x27;combat&#x27;) attached to &quot;uolcos&quot; (&#x27;falcon, hawk&#x27;). The Eburonean name has an exact parallel in the Welsh &quot;cadwalch&quot; (&#x27;hero, champion, warrior&#x27;). It has been noted that the use of the Proto-Indo-European stem &quot;*katu-&quot; (&#x27;fight&#x27;) as a compound in personal names is common to both Gallic and Germanic traditions (e.g., &quot;Catu-rīx&quot; and &quot;Haðu-rīh&quot;, which are cognates). The name &#x27;Ambiorix&#x27; is generally analyzed as the Gaulish prefix &quot;ambio-&quot; attached to &quot;rix&quot; (&#x27;king&#x27;); it could be interpreted as meaning &#x27;king of the surroundings&#x27; or &#x27;king protector&#x27;.

=== Material culture ===
The material culture of the region has been found by archaeologists to be highly Celtised, clearly in contact with the Celts of central Gaul, though far less rich in terms of Mediterranean luxury goods. They were not so strongly linked to the east of the Rhine. This would at the very least seem to suggest that at least the upper echelons were Celtic or had adopted a Celtic language and culture.

A further complication is that the population of the Eburones may have been made up of different components. As mentioned above, archaeological evidence implies continuity going back to Urnfield times, but with signs that militarized elites had moved in more than once, bringing forms of the Celtic-associated cultures known as Hallstatt and later La Tène. No clear archaeological evidence has been found to confirm Caesar&#x27;s account that the Eburones came specifically from over the Rhine. However, these Celtic cultures were also present there, and in the period when Caesar supposes that they arrived, the peoples immediately over the Rhine were most likely not speakers of a Germanic language.

== Political organization ==
The Eburones were probably a loose federation of several small clans, which may explain the dual kingship institution. Their political system, similar to that of the Sugambri, included several kings ruling on different territories. The distribution of Eburonean triskeles staters also points to a polycentric political structures with several cores of influence. According to Roymans, &quot;the fact that the Eburones and, somewhat later, the Sugambri were in a position to triumph over Roman armies attests to the ability of groups and individuals in these societies to summon considerable strength, at least in periods of crisis.&quot; The formation of comitati was probably common during the Late Iron Age, as evidenced by the retinue of equites that escorted Ambiorix as he fled the Roman troops, and by similar practices attested in neighbouring tribes.

At the time of the Roman conquest, the Eburones were clients of the Treveri, and Caesar mentions that the Eburonean king Ambiorix began his revolt against the Romans at the insistence of the Treveri. They were also paying tribute to the Atuatuci, who were holding Eburonean hostages in chains and slavery, including the son and nephew of the Eburone king Ambiorix. It was with these two tribes that the Eburones quickly formed a military alliance against Caesar&#x27;s forces. Caesar also reports that, during the conflict, the Eburones had some sort of alliance, organized via their allies the Treveri, with the Germanic tribes over the Rhine.

<doc id="727204" wikidata="Q592442" url="?curid=727204" title="Prognosis">
<text>Prognosis (Greek: πρόγνωσις &quot;fore-knowing, foreseeing&quot;; : prognoses) is a medical term for predicting the likelihood or expected development of a disease, including whether the signs and symptoms will improve or worsen (and how quickly) or remain stable over time; expectations of quality of life, such as the ability to carry out daily activities; the potential for complications and associated health issues; and the likelihood of survival (including life expectancy). A prognosis is made on the basis of the normal course of the diagnosed disease, the individual&#x27;s physical and mental condition, the available treatments, and additional factors. A complete prognosis includes the expected duration, function, and description of the course of the disease, such as progressive decline, intermittent crisis, or sudden, unpredictable crisis.

When applied to large statistical populations, prognostic estimates can be very accurate: for example the statement &quot;45% of patients with severe septic shock will die within 28 days&quot; can be made with some confidence, because previous research found that this proportion of patients died. This statistical information does not apply to the prognosis for each individual patient, because patient-specific factors can substantially change the expected course of the disease: additional information is needed to determine whether a patient belongs to the 45% who will die, or to the 55% who survive.

==Methodology==
===Disease and prognostic indicators===
Prognostic scoring is also used for cancer outcome predictions. A Manchester score is an indicator of prognosis for small-cell lung cancer. For Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, physicians have developed the International Prognostic Index to predict patient outcome.

Other medical areas where prognostic indicators are used is in Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) (Hy&#x27;s law) and use of an exercise stress test as a prognostic indicator after myocardial infarction, also used to indicate multiple myeloma survival rate.

===End of life===
Studies have found that most doctors are overly optimistic when making a prognosis; they tend to overstate how long a patient might live. For patients who are critically ill, particularly those in an intensive care unit, there are numerical prognostic scoring systems that are more accurate. The most famous of these is the APACHE II scale, which is most accurate when applied in the seven days prior to a patient&#x27;s predicted death.

Knowing the prognosis helps determine whether it makes more sense to attempt certain treatments or to withhold them, and thus plays an important role in end-of-life decisions and advanced care planning.

==Estimator==
Estimators that are commonly used to describe prognoses include:
*&quot;Progression-free survival&quot; - the length of time during and after medication or treatment during which the disease being treated (usually cancer) does not get worse.
*&quot;Survival rate&quot; – indicating the percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive for a given period of time after diagnosis.
*&quot;Survival time&quot; – the remaining duration of life. If not otherwise specified, it generally starts from the time of diagnosis.

==History==
One of the earliest written works of medicine is the Book of Prognostics of Hippocrates, written around 400 BC. This work opens with the following statement: &quot;It appears to me a most excellent thing for the physician to cultivate Prognosis; for by foreseeing and foretelling, in the presence of the sick, the present, the past, and the future, and explaining the omissions which patients have been guilty of, he will be the more readily believed to be acquainted with the circumstances of the sick; so that men will have confidence to intrust themselves to such a physician.&quot;

For 19th-century physicians, particularly those following the French school of medicine, the main aim of medicine was not to cure disease, but rather to give a medical diagnosis and achieve a satisfying &quot;prognosis&quot; of the patient&#x27;s chances. Only several decades later did the focus of efforts in Western medicine shift to curing disease.

<doc id="727210" wikidata="Q331740" url="?curid=727210" title="Raid on the Medway">
<text>The Raid on the Medway, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War in June 1667, was a successful attack conducted by the Dutch navy on English warships laid up in the fleet anchorages off Chatham Dockyard and Gillingham in the county of Kent. At the time, the fortress of Upnor Castle and a barrier chain called the &quot;Gillingham Line&quot; were supposed to protect the English ships.

The Dutch, under nominal command of Willem Joseph van Ghent and Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, over several days bombarded and captured the town of Sheerness, sailed up the Thames Estuary to Gravesend, then sailed into the River Medway to Chatham and Gillingham, where they engaged fortifications with cannon fire, burned or captured three capital ships and ten more ships of the line, and captured and towed away the flagship of the English fleet, . The stern of which is still on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

Politically, the raid was disastrous for the war plans of Charles II of England. It led to a quick end to the war, and a favourable peace for the Dutch. It was one of the worst defeats in the Royal Navy&#x27;s history, and one of the worst suffered by the British military. Horace George Franks called it the &quot;most serious defeat it has ever had in its home waters.&quot;

==Prelude==

In 1667 Charles II&#x27;s active fleet was in a reduced state due to recent expenditure restrictions, with the remaining &quot;big ships&quot; laid up. The Dutch seized this opportunity to attack the English. They had made earlier plans for such an attack in 1666 after the Four Days&#x27; Battle but were prevented from carrying them out by their defeat in the St James&#x27;s Day Battle. The mastermind behind the plan was the leading Dutch politician Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt. His brother Cornelis de Witt accompanied the fleet to supervise. Peace negotiations had been in progress at Breda since March, but Charles had been procrastinating over the signing of peace, hoping to improve his position through secret French assistance. Based on these assumptions De Witt thought it best to end the war quickly with a clear victory, thereby ensuring a more advantageous settlement for the Dutch Republic. Most Dutch flag officers had strong doubts about the feasibility of such a daring attack, fearing the treacherous shoals in the Thames Estuary, but they obeyed orders nevertheless. The Dutch made use of two English pilots who had defected, one a dissenter named Robert Holland, the other a smuggler who had fled English justice.

==Raid==
===Dutch approach===
On 17 May the squadron of the Admiralty of Rotterdam with De Ruyter sailed to Texel to join those of Amsterdam and the Northern Quarter. Hearing that the squadron of Frisia was not yet ready because of recruiting problems (impressment being forbidden in the Republic), he left for the Schooneveld off the Dutch coast to join the squadron of Zealand that, however, suffered from similar problems. De Ruyter then departed for the Thames on 4 June (Old Style used by the English, the Dutch at the time were officially using New Style dates) with 62 frigates or ships-of-the-line, about fifteen lighter ships and twelve fireships, when the wind turned to the east. The fleet was reorganised into three squadrons: the first was commanded by De Ruyter himself, with as Vice-Admiral Johan de Liefde and Rear-Admiral Jan Jansse van Nes; the second was commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes with as Vice-Admiral Enno Doedes Star and Rear-Admiral Willem van der Zaan; the third was commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Baron Willem Joseph van Ghent with Lieutenant-Admiral Jan van Meppel in subcommand and as Vice-Admirals Isaac Sweers and Volckert Schram and as Rear-Admirals David Vlugh and Jan Gideonsz Verburgh. The third squadron thus effectively had a second set of commanders; this was done to use these as flag officers of a special frigate landing force, to be formed on arrival and to be headed by Colonel and Lieutenant-Admiral Van Ghent, on the frigate &quot;Agatha&quot;. Baron Van Ghent was in fact the real commander of the expedition and had done all the operational planning, as he had been the former commander of the Dutch Marine Corps (the first corps in history to be specialised in amphibious operations) that now was headed by the Englishman Colonel Thomas Dolman.

On 6 June a fog bank was blown away and revealed the Dutch task force, sailing into the mouth of the Thames. On 7 June Cornelis de Witt revealed his secret instructions from the States General, written on 20 May, in the presence of all commanders. There were so many objections, while De Ruyter&#x27;s only substantial contribution to the discussion was &quot;bevelen zijn bevelen&quot; (&quot;orders are orders&quot;), that Cornelis, after retiring to his cabin late in the night, wrote in his daily report he did not feel at all sure that he would be obeyed. The next day it transpired however that most officers were in for a bit of adventure; they had just given their professional opinion for the record so they could blame the politicians should the whole enterprise end in disaster. That day an attempt was made to capture a fleet of twenty English merchantmen seen higher up the Thames in the direction of London, but this failed as these fled to the west, beyond Gravesend.

The attack caught the English unaware. No serious preparations had been made for such an eventuality, although there had been ample warning from the extensive English spy network. Most frigates were assembled in squadrons at Harwich and in Scotland, leaving the London area to be protected by only a small number of active ships, most of them prizes taken earlier in the war from the Dutch. As a further measure of economy, on 24 March the Duke of York had ordered the discharge of most of the crews of the prize vessels, leaving only three guard ships at the Medway; in compensation the crew of one of them, the frigate (former &quot;Eendracht&quot;, the first ship to be captured from the Dutch in 1665, from the privateer Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest) was raised from forty to sixty; also the number of fireships was increased from one to three. Additionally thirty large sloops were to be prepared to row any ship to safety in case of an emergency. Sir William Coventry declared that a Dutch landing near London was very unlikely; at most the Dutch, to bolster their morale, would launch a token attack at some medium-sized and exposed target like Harwich, which place therefore had been strongly fortified in the spring. There was no clear line of command with most responsible authorities giving hasty orders without bothering to co-ordinate them first.

As a result, there was much confusion. Charles did not take matters into his own hands, deferring mostly to the opinion of others. English morale was low. Not having been paid for months or even years, most sailors and soldiers were less than enthusiastic to risk their lives. England had only a small army and the few available units were dispersed as Dutch intentions were unclear. This explains why no effective countermeasures were taken though it took the Dutch about five days to reach Chatham, slowly maneuvering through the shoals, leaving the heavier vessels behind as a covering force. They could only advance in jumps when the tide was favourable.

After raising the alarm on 6 June at Chatham Dockyard, Commissioner Peter Pett seems not to have taken any further action until 9 June when, late in the afternoon, a fleet of about thirty Dutch ships was sighted in the Thames off Sheerness. At this point the Commissioner immediately sought assistance from the Admiralty, sending a pessimistic message to the Navy Board, lamenting the absence of Navy senior officials whose help and advice he believed he needed. The thirty ships were those of Van Ghent&#x27;s squadron of frigates. The Dutch fleet carried about a thousand marines and landing parties were dispatched to Canvey Island in Essex and opposite on the Kent side at Sheerness. These men had strict orders by Cornelis de Witt not to plunder, as the Dutch wanted to shame the English whose troops had sacked Terschelling during Holmes&#x27;s Bonfire in August 1666. Nevertheless, the crew of Captain Jan van Brakel could not control themselves. They were driven off by English militia, and found themselves under threat of severe punishment upon returning to the Dutch fleet. Van Brakel offered to lead the attack the next day to avoid the penalty.

Charles ordered the Earl of Oxford on 8 June to mobilise the militia of all counties around London; also all available barges should be used to lay a ship&#x27;s bridge across the Lower Thames, so that the English cavalry could quickly switch positions from one bank to the other. Sir Edward Spragge, the Vice-Admiral, learned on 9 June that a Dutch raiding party had come ashore on the Isle of Grain (a peninsula where the river Medway in Kent, meets the River Thames). Musketeers from the Sheerness garrison opposite were sent to investigate.

Only in the afternoon of 10 June did Charles instruct Admiral George Monck, Duke of Albemarle to go to Chatham to take charge of matters, a full three days later ordering Admiral Prince Rupert to organise the defences at Woolwich. Albemarle went first to Gravesend where he noted to his dismay that there and at Tilbury only a few guns were present, too few to halt a possible Dutch advance upon the Thames. To prevent such a disaster, he ordered all available artillery from the capital to be positioned at Gravesend. On 11 June (Old Style) he went to Chatham, expecting the place to be well prepared for an attack. Two members of the Navy Board, Sir John Mennes and Lord Henry Brouncker, had already travelled there on the same day. When Albemarle arrived, however, he found only twelve of the eight hundred dockyard men expected and these in a state of panic; of the thirty sloops only ten were present, the other twenty having been used to evacuate the personal possessions of several officials, such as Pett&#x27;s ship models. No munitions or powder were available and the six-inch-thick iron chain built as a navigational barrier across the Medway had not yet been protected by batteries. This chain system had been built during the English Civil War to repel a possible attack by the Royalist fleet, replacing earlier versions, the first dating back to 1585. Albemarle immediately ordered the artillery to be moved from Gravesend to Chatham, which would take a day.

===Attack===

The Dutch fleet arrived at the Isle of Sheppey on 10 June, and launched an attack on the incomplete Garrison Point Fort. Captain Jan van Brakel in &quot;Vrede&quot;, (&quot;peace&quot;) followed by two other men-of-war, sailed as close to the fort as possible to engage it with cannon fire. Sir Edward Spragge was in command of the ships at anchor in the Medway and those off Sheerness, but the only ship able to defend against the Dutch was the frigate &quot;Unity&quot;, which was stationed off the fort.

&quot;Unity&quot; was supported by a number of ketches and fireships at Garrison Point, and by the fort, where sixteen guns had been hastily placed. &quot;Unity&quot; fired one broadside, but then, when attacked by a Dutch fireship, she withdrew up the Medway, followed by the English fireships and ketches. The Dutch fired on the fort; two men were hit. It then transpired that no surgeon was available and most of the soldiers of the Scottish garrison now deserted. Seven remained, but their position became untenable when some 800 Dutch marines landed about a mile away. With Sheerness thus lost, its guns being captured by the Dutch and the building blown up, Spragge sailed up river for Chatham on his yacht &quot;Henrietta&quot;. Many officers were now assembled there: Spragge himself, the next day also Monck and several men of the admiralty board. All gave orders countermanding those of the others so that utter confusion reigned.

As his artillery would not arrive soon, Monck on the 11th ordered a squadron of cavalry and a company of soldiers to reinforce Upnor Castle. River defences were hastily improvised with blockships sunk, and the chain across the river was guarded by light batteries. Pett proposed that several big and smaller ships be sunk to block the Musselbank channel in front of the chain. This way the large &quot;Golden Phoenix&quot; and &quot;House of Sweden&quot; (the former VOC ships &quot;Gulden Phenix&quot; and &quot;Huis van Swieten&quot;) and &quot;Welcome&quot; and &quot;Leicester&quot; were lost and the smaller &quot;Constant John&quot;, &quot;Unicorn&quot; and &quot;John and Sarah&quot;; when this was shown by Spragge to be insufficient, personally sounding the depth of a second channel despite the assurances by Pett, they were joined by &quot;Barbados Merchant&quot;, &quot;Dolphin&quot;, &quot;Edward and Eve&quot;, &quot;Hind&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot;. To do this the men first intended for the warships to be protected were used, so the most valuable ships were basically without crews. These blockships were placed in a rather easterly position, on the line Upchurch–Stoke, and could not be covered by fire. Monck then decided also to sink blockships in Upnor Reach near Upnor Castle, presenting another barrier to the Dutch should they break through the chain at Gillingham. The defensive chain placed across the river had at its lowest point been lying practically nine feet (about three metres) under the water between its stages, owing to its weight, so it was still possible for light ships to pass it. Attempts were made to raise it by placing stages under it closer to the shore.

The positions of and (former Dutch merchantmen &quot;Carolus Quintus&quot; and &quot;Geldersche Ruyter&quot;), just above the chain were adjusted to enable them to bring their broadsides to bear upon it. was also moored above the chain, positioned so that she could bring her guns to bear on the space between &quot;Charles V&quot; and &quot;Matthias&quot;. The frigate &quot;Marmaduke&quot; and &quot;Norway Merchant&quot; were sunk above the chain; the large &quot;Sancta Maria&quot; (former VOC ship &quot;Slot van Honingen&quot; of 70 cannon) foundered while being moved for the same purpose. Pett also informed Monck that &quot;Royal Charles&quot; had to be moved upriver. He had been ordered by the Duke of York on 27 March to do this, but as yet had not complied. Monck at first refused to make available some of his small number of sloops, as they were needed to move supplies; when he at last found the captain of &quot;Matthias&quot; willing to assist, Pett answered that it was too late as he was busy sinking the blockships and there was no pilot to be found daring to take such a risk anyway. Meanwhile, the first Dutch frigates to arrive had already begun to move the &quot;Edward and Eve&quot; away, clearing a channel by nightfall.
Van Ghent&#x27;s squadron now advanced up the Medway on 12 June, attacking the English defences at the chain. First &quot;Unity&quot; was taken by Van Brakel by assault. Then the fireship &quot;Pro Patria&quot; under commander Jan Daniëlsz van Rijn broke through the chain. According to Dutch eyewitness Otto de Vooght and 17th century historian Gerard Brandt the chain was broken by a landing party of Dutch engineers commanded by Rear-Admiral David Vlugh using hammers. The more spectacular traditional version of events can be traced to a play by Joost van den Vondel.

Next the &quot;Matthias&quot; was destroyed by fire. The fireships &quot;Catharina&quot; and &quot;Schiedam&quot; attacked &quot;Charles V&quot;; &quot;Catharina&quot; under commander Hendrik Hendriksz was sunk by the shore batteries but &quot;Schiedam&quot; under commander Gerrit Andriesz Mak set &quot;Charles V&quot; alight; the crew was captured by Van Brakel. &quot;Royal Charles&quot;, with only thirty cannon aboard and abandoned by her skeleton crew when they saw &quot;Matthias&quot; burn, was then captured by the Irishman Thomas Tobiasz, the flag captain of Vice-Admiral Johan de Liefde, and carried off to the Netherlands despite an unfavourable tide. This was made possible by lowering her draft by bringing her into a slight tilt. The jack was struck while a trumpeter played &quot;Joan&#x27;s placket is torn&quot;. Only &quot;Monmouth&quot; escaped. Seeing the disaster Monck ordered all sixteen remaining warships further up to be sunk to prevent them from being captured, making for a total of about thirty ships deliberately sunk by the English themselves. As Andrew Marvell satirised:

:&quot;Of all our navy none should now survive,&quot;
:&quot;But that the ships themselves were taught to dive&quot;

On 13 June, the whole of the Thames side as far up as London was in a panic—some spread the rumour that the Dutch were in the process of transporting a French army from Dunkirk for a full-scale invasion—and many wealthy citizens fled the city, taking their most valuable possessions with them. The Dutch continued their advance into the Chatham docks with the fireships &quot;Delft&quot;, &quot;Rotterdam&quot;, &quot;Draak&quot;, &quot;Wapen van Londen&quot;, &quot;Gouden Appel&quot; and &quot;Princess&quot;, under English fire from Upnor Castle and from three shore batteries. A number of Dutch frigates suppressed the English fire, themselves suffering about forty casualties in dead and wounded. Three of the finest and heaviest vessels in the navy, already sunk to prevent capture, now perished by fire: first , set alight by &quot;Rotterdam&quot; under commander Cornelis Jacobsz van der Hoeven; then and finally , that withstood attempts by two fireships but was burnt by a third. The English crews abandoned their half-flooded ships, mostly without a fight, a notable exception being army Captain Archibald Douglas, of the Scots Foot, who personally refused to abandon &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and perished in the flames. &quot;Monmouth&quot; again escaped. The raid thus cost the English four of their remaining eight ships with more than 75 cannon. Three of the four largest &quot;big ships&quot; of the navy were lost. The remaining &quot;big ship&quot;, was preserved due to her being at Portsmouth at the time. De Ruyter now joined Van Ghent&#x27;s squadron in person.

==Account by Samuel Pepys==

The diary of Samuel Pepys, as secretary of the Navy Board, is often cited in descriptions of the raid, as it gives direct information about the attitude of the policy makers in this period and of the psychological impact of the attack.

Pepys at first seems to accept the consensus that the Dutch would not dare to launch an expedition against the London area; still on 18 April he writes:

At that moment De Ruyter had already been on &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; for a week. Nevertheless, he is aware of the preparations at Chatham, writing on 23 March:

Also he is the next day present at the meeting where the details are given: 

Only on 3 June does Pepys become aware that the Dutch are out in force:

Not until 10 June does Pepys understand that the Thames is the target: &quot;News brought us that, the Dutch are come up as high as the Nore; and more pressing orders for fireships.&quot; The next day a growing sense of panic becomes apparent: 

In the morning of the 12th he is reassured by the measures taken by Monck: &quot;(...) met Sir W. Coventry&#x27;s boy; and there in his letter find that the Dutch had made no motion since their taking Sheernesse; and the Duke of Albemarle writes that all is safe as to the great ships against any assault, the boom and chaine being so fortified; which put my heart into great joy.&quot;

Soon, however, this confidence is shattered: &quot;(...)his clerk, Powell, do tell me that ill newes is come to Court of the Dutch breaking the Chaine at Chatham; which struck me to the heart. And to White Hall to hear the truth of it; and there, going up the back-stairs, I did hear some lacquies speaking of sad newes come to Court, saying, that hardly anybody in the Court but do look as if he cried(...).&quot;

Pepys immediately draws the conclusion that this will mean the end of Charles&#x27;s regime and that a revolution is inevitable: &quot;All our hearts do now ake; for the newes is true, that the Dutch have broke the chaine and burned our ships, and particularly &quot;The Royal Charles&quot;, other particulars I know not, but most sad to be sure. And, the truth is, I do fear so much that the whole kingdom is undone, that I do this night resolve to study with my father and wife what to do with the little that I have in money by me(...).&quot;

On the 13th, the countermeasures proposed only increase his fears and make him decide to take his family and capital to safety:

The entire city is in a state of panic: 

Then even worse news is brought: &quot;Late at night comes Mr. Hudson, the cooper, my neighbour, and tells me that he come from Chatham this evening at five o&#x27;clock, and saw this afternoon &quot;The Royal James,&quot; &quot;Oake,&quot; and &quot;London,&quot; burnt by the enemy with their fire-ships: that two or three men-of-war come up with them, and made no more of Upnor Castle&#x27;s shooting, than of a fly(...).&quot;

On the 14th more details become known of the events the previous day, showing the morale of the sailors: &quot;[he] did hear many Englishmen aboard the Dutch ships speaking to one another in English, and that they did cry and say: &#x27;We did heretofore fight for tickets; now we fight for dollars!&#x27; and did ask how such and such a one did, and would commend themselves to them: which is a sad consideration&quot;, and the mood of the people towards Charles &quot;they did in open streets yesterday at Westminster, cry, &#x27;A Parliament! a Parliament!&#x27;; and I do believe it will cost blood to answer for these miscarriages.&quot;

==The Dutch withdraw==

As he expected a stiffening English resistance, Cornelis de Witt on 14 June decided to forego a further penetration and withdraw, towing &quot;Royal Charles&quot; along as a war trophy; &quot;Unity&quot; also was removed with a prize crew. This decision saved the scuttled capital ships , , and . However, Dutch sailors rowed to any English ship they could reach to set her on fire, thus ensuring their reward money. One boat even re-entered the docks to make sure nothing was left above the waterline of the English vessels &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, &quot;Royal James&quot; and &quot;Loyal London&quot;; another burned the merchantman &quot;Slot van Honingen,&quot; though it had been intended to salvage this precious ship. By chance, the shore facilities of Chatham Dockyard escaped destruction as no Dutch vessels reached her docks; the survival of these docks ensured the Royal Navy could repair her sunken ships. English villages were plundered—by their own troops.

The Dutch fleet, after celebrating by collectively thanking God for &quot;a great victory in a just war in self-defence&quot; tried to repeat its success by attacking several other ports on the English east coast but was repelled each time. On 27 June an attempt to enter the Thames beyond Gravesend was called off when it became known that the river was blocked by blockships and five fireships awaited the Dutch attack. On 2 July a Dutch marine force landed near Woodbridge north of Harwich and successfully prevented Landguard Fort from being reinforced but a direct assault on the fort by 1500 marines was beaten off by the garrison. On 3 July an attack on Osley Bay failed. On 21 July Julian calendar peace was signed.

But still, Samuel Pepys notes in his diary on 19 July 1667: &quot;The Dutch fleete are in great squadrons everywhere still about Harwich, and were lately at Portsmouth; and the last letters say at Plymouth, and now gone to Dartmouth to destroy our Streights&#x27; fleete lately got in thither; but God knows whether they can do it any hurt, or no, but it was pretty news come the other day so fast, of the Dutch fleets being in so many places, that Sir W. Batten at table cried, &quot;By God,&quot; says he, &quot;I think the Devil shits Dutchmen.&quot;&quot;And on 29 July 1667: &quot;Thus in all things, in wisdom, courage, force, knowledge of our own streams, and success, the Dutch have the best of us, and do end the war with victory on their side&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Wharf official John Norman estimated the damage caused by the raid at about £20,000, apart from the replacement costs of the four lost capital ships; the total loss of the Royal Navy must have been close to £200,000. Pett was made a scapegoat, bailed at £5,000 and deprived of his office while those who had ignored his earlier warnings quietly escaped any blame. &quot;Royal James&quot;, &quot;Royal Oak&quot; and &quot;Loyal London&quot; were in the end salvaged and rebuilt, but at great cost and when the City of London refused to share in it, Charles had the name of the latter ship changed to a simple &quot;London&quot;. For a few years the English fleet was handicapped by its losses during the raid, but by around 1670 a new building programme had restored the English Navy to its former strength.

The Raid on the Medway was a serious blow to the reputation of the English crown. Charles felt personally offended by the fact the Dutch had attacked while he had laid up his fleet and peace negotiations were in progress. His resentment was one of the causes of the Third Anglo-Dutch War as it made him enter into the secret Treaty of Dover with King Louis XIV of France. In the 19th century, several British writers expanded on this theme by suggesting it had been the Dutch who had sued for peace after their defeats in 1666—although in fact these had made them, if anything, more belligerent—and that only by treacherously attacking the English had they nevertheless been able to gain a victory; an example of this is &quot;When London burned&quot;, written by the novelist G. A. Henty in 1895. In the short term, the Lord Chancellor, Edward Hyde was made the scapegoat, impeached and forced into exile.

Total losses for the Dutch were eight spent fireships and about fifty casualties. In the Republic the populace was jubilant after the victory; many festivities were held, repeated when the fleet returned in October, the various admirals being hailed as heroes. They were rewarded by a flood of eulogies and given honorary golden chains and pensions by the States General and the lesser States of the Provinces; De Ruyter, Cornelis de Witt and Van Ghent were honoured by precious enamelled golden chalices made by Nicolaes Lockeman, depicting the events. Cornelis de Witt had a large &quot;Sea Triumph&quot; painted, with himself as the main subject, which was displayed in the townhall of Dordt. This triumphalism by De Witt&#x27;s States faction caused resentment with the rivalling Orangist faction; when the States regime lost its power during the &quot;rampjaar&quot; of 1672, Cornelis&#x27;s head was to be ceremoniously carved out from the painting, after Charles had for some years insisted the picture would be removed.

&quot;Royal Charles&quot;, her draft too deep to be of use in the shallow Dutch waters, was permanently drydocked near Hellevoetsluis as a tourist attraction, with day trips being organised for large parties, often of foreign state guests. After vehement protests by Charles that this insulted his honour, the official visits were ended and &quot;Royal Charles&quot; was eventually scrapped in 1672; however, part of her transom, bearing the coat of arms with the Lion and Unicorn and the Royal inscription &quot;Dieu et mon droit&quot;, was preserved because Charles earlier had demanded its removal and it has since 1883 been put on display in the cellar of the &quot;Rijksmuseum&quot; in Amsterdam.

On 14 March 2012 the transom was transported to England on board the Royal Netherlands Navy patrol ship &quot;Holland&quot;, accompanied by the then Dutch crown prince Willem-Alexander, where it was put on display, in commodate, at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich as part of the &quot;Royal River: Power, Pageantry and the Thames&quot; exhibition held on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

<doc id="727239" wikidata="Q3784228" url="?curid=727239" title="Adforton">
<text>Adforton is a small village and a civil parish in north Herefordshire, England. It is on the A4110 main road approximately north of Hereford and of Wigmore, and is close to the Wales border.

==History==
The name Adforton means &#x27;settlement of Ad&#x27;s fort&#x27;.

John Marius Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; describes Adforton as &quot;a township with Stanway, Paytoe, and Grange, in the parish of Leintwardine, in Hereford 2 miles north west of Wigmore with a population of 250 people and 57 houses within the area.&quot;

==Demography==


Between 1881 and 2001 the population fluctuated, but reduced from 204 to 118. Census data shows a peak population of 215 in 1901. Since 2001, with its lowest point of 118 residents, the population rose, and by 2011 was 128.

The census data for 1881 shows that agricultural work was the dominant occupation among males, with 32 men working on farms and with animals; other occupation areas for men included the professions, furniture design and lodging. Data for females shows that most occupations (29) were unspecified and another six were unknown.

According to the 2011 census, occupations in skilled trades was the most widespread for men, while six men were variously employed as managers, directors, professionals and senior officials; occupations with lowest counts were in sales and customer service and administrative and secretarial occupations. Eight women were employed in administrative and secretarial services, with the lowest count was for professions.

==Church==
St Andrew&#x27;s Church was designed and built in 1875 by the architect John Pollard Seddon. Until St Andrew&#x27;s was built there was only a 1863-built Primitive Methodist chapel. The church doubles as a community hall.

North of the village are the remains of Wigmore Abbey and fragments of its monastic grange. Established in 1179, in the Middle Ages the abbey was the largest, and among the most prosperous, in Herefordshire. The grange comprises a range of buildings which have now been converted into a house.

<doc id="727240" wikidata="Q365478" url="?curid=727240" title="Hank Marvin">
<text>Hank Brian Marvin (born Brian Robson Rankin, 28 October 1941) is an English multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and songwriter. He is known as the lead guitarist for the Shadows.

== Early life and career ==
Marvin was born as Brian Robson Rankin at 138 Stanhope Street in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. His father was an army officer. He played banjo and piano. After hearing Buddy Holly he decided to learn the guitar and also adopted Holly-style dark-rimmed glasses.

He chose his stage name while launching his career. It is an amalgamation of his childhood nickname, Hank, and the first name of American country singer Marvin Rainwater.

==Career==

=== The Shadows ===

He moved to London in April 1958 after persuading his parents to let him do so in pursuit of a career in the music business. Sixteen-year-old Marvin and his Rutherford Grammar School friend, Bruce Welch, met Johnny Foster, Cliff Richard&#x27;s manager, at The 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar in Soho, London. Foster was looking for a guitarist for Cliff Richard&#x27;s UK tour and was considering Tony Sheridan. Instead he offered Marvin the position. Marvin agreed to join the Drifters, as Cliff Richard&#x27;s group was then known, provided there was a place for Welch.

Marvin met Richard for the first time at a nearby Soho tailor&#x27;s shop, where Richard was having a fitting for a stage jacket. The Drifters had their first rehearsal with Richard at the Webb family home (Cliff&#x27;s parents) in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. After a threat of legal action by representatives of the American band of the same name, the Drifters became The Shadows in 1959.

The Shadows were known for their instrumental songs, mainly; &quot;Apache&quot; (1960), &quot;F.B.I.&quot; (1961), &quot;Wonderful Land&quot; (1962), and &quot;Foot Tapper&quot; (1963), among many others. The band split up briefly between 1968 and 1973, but was reformed by Marvin, Welch and Bennett.

Marvin and the Shadows reformed for a 2004 Final Tour, and a 2005 European tour was also undertaken. Cliff Richard and the Shadows performed the final tour dates in 2009 and 2010.

===Solo career===

His first critically lauded, eponymous solo album of instrumentals, which featured guitar set to orchestrated backing, was released in 1969, following the first disbanding of the Shadows, in late 1968. The single &quot;Sacha&quot; topped the singles chart in New South Wales, Australia, having been &#x27;discovered&#x27; by two DJs at 2WG Wagga Wagga. Marvin has experimented with styles and material, releasing some instrumental albums, some with mostly vocals (e.g. &quot;Words and Music&quot;, &quot;All Alone With Friends&quot;), one with only acoustic guitars and one with a guitar orchestra (&quot;The Hank Marvin Guitar Syndicate&quot;).

In 1970, Marvin and Welch formed Marvin, Welch &amp; Farrar, a vocal-harmony trio. They became &#x27;Marvin &amp; Farrar&#x27; for a vocal album in 1973 and then reverted to the Shadows in late 1973, for the instrumental &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Curly Leads&quot; album. The Shadows came second for the United Kingdom in the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest with &quot;Let Me Be the One&quot;.

Marvin wrote &quot;Driftin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Geronimo&quot;, &quot;Spider Juice&quot; (his daughter&#x27;s name for orange juice), &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot; for the Shadows, and &quot;The Day I Met Marie&quot;. He co-wrote Richard&#x27;s 1961 hit; &quot;Gee Whizz It&#x27;s You&quot; with Ian Samwell. With Welch, Brian Bennett, and John Rostill, he wrote hits for Cliff Richard, including; &quot;On the Beach&quot;, &quot;I Could Easily Fall in Love with You&quot;, &quot;Time Drags By&quot;, and &quot;In the Country&quot;.

In 1969 and 1970, he teamed with Richard for: two &#x27;Cliff &amp; Hank&#x27; hit singles, his own song; &quot;Throw Down a Line&quot; (also recorded by Marvin, Welch &amp; Farrar), and &quot;The Joy of Living&quot;, while Richard also had a hit with his ecology song, &quot;Silvery Rain&quot;. &quot;Silvery Rain&quot; was covered by Olivia Newton-John on her 1981 album &quot;Physical&quot;.

In 1977, Marvin played lead guitar on Roger Daltrey&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;One of the Boys&quot;, on the tracks &quot;Parade&quot; and &quot;Leon&quot;. He co-wrote Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s 1977 hit &quot;Sam&quot; with John Farrar and Don Black.

In 1988, Marvin collaborated with French keyboardist and composer Jean Michel Jarre on the track &quot;London Kid&quot;, on Jarre&#x27;s &quot;Revolutions&quot; album and was a guest in Jarre&#x27;s Destination Docklands concert at London&#x27;s Royal Victoria Dock. Jarre said the Shadows&#x27; success had influenced him and led to his decision to devote his career to instrumental music.

In 1992, Duane Eddy guested on Marvin&#x27;s album &quot;Into the Light&quot; on the track &quot;Pipeline&quot;.
Marvin dueted twice with French guitarist Jean-Pierre Danel on his 2007 and 2010 albums, both top-ten hits and certified gold. Marvin also participated on one of his DVDs and wrote the foreword for Danel&#x27;s book about the Fender Stratocaster.

Marvin has continued to release instrumental solo albums, all of which have reached the UK Top 10 album charts since 2002. His latest solo album, &quot;Without a Word&quot;, was released in 2017.

In 2024, Marvin contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

==Personal life==
His first wife was Beryl, with whom he had four children. He is currently married to Carole, with whom he had two children.

Since 1986, Marvin has lived in Perth, Western Australia. He has made impromptu appearances on stage when musician friends visit the area, such as in February 2013 when Cliff Richard held a concert at Sandalford Winery. He is one of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Marvin has developed a keen interest in the music of jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt and performs regularly with his group, &quot;Hank Marvin&#x27;s Gypsy Jazz&quot;.

==Style and influence==
According to Guitar.com, &quot;In 1960 [Marvin] defined the role of &#x27;lead guitarist&#x27;&quot; and &quot;became the first British &#x27;guitar hero&#x27;&quot;. The website continued, &quot;Hank is legendary for his expressive phrasing, but rather than use his Strat&#x27;s controls to accentuate volume swells, he prefers to use a pedal to give that vocal quality to his lines.&quot; Marvin influenced many British rock guitarists, including George Harrison, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, Brian May, Mark Knopfler, Peter Frampton, Steve Howe, Roy Wood, Tony Iommi, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. 

In 1959, Cliff Richard purchased a fiesta red Fender Stratocaster for Marvin to use on stage, which is widely claimed to be the first Stratocaster in the United Kingdom. Although it allegedly still belongs to Richard, it has been in the possession of Bruce Welch since 1968. Marvin has performed on stage almost exclusively with fiesta red Stratocasters since Richard&#x27;s original purchase.

In Canada, Cliff Richard and the Shadows had top 10 hits, especially from 1961 to 1965. Canadian guitarists Randy Bachman and Neil Young credit Marvin as influential, Young penning the song &quot;From Hank to Hendrix&quot; on his &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; album in partial tribute.

&quot;Hank Marvin&quot; is rhyming slang for &quot;starvin&quot; (&quot;starving&quot;). This slang was referenced in a 2012 television advertisement for Mattessons meat company.

== Awards ==
While Welch and Bennett were both appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours for services to music, Marvin declined for &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

On 28 October 2009, Marvin was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of his unique contribution to music.

<doc id="727242" wikidata="Q402893" url="?curid=727242" title="Sodium–sulfur battery">
<text>A sodium–sulfur (NaS) battery is a type of molten-salt battery that uses liquid sodium and liquid sulfur electrodes. This type of battery has a similar energy density to lithium-ion batteries, and is fabricated from inexpensive and low-toxicity materials. Due to the high operating temperature required (usually between 300 and 350 °C), as well as the highly reactive nature of sodium and sodium polysulfides, these batteries are primarily suited for stationary energy storage applications, rather than for use in vehicles. Molten Na-S batteries are scalable in size: there is a 1 MW microgrid support system on Catalina Island CA (USA) and a 50 MW/300 MWh system in Fukuoka, Kyushu, (Japan). In 2024, only one company (NGK Insulators) produced molten NaS batteries on a commercial scale. BASF Stationary Energy Storage GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of BASF SE, acts as a distributor and development partner for the NaS batteries produced by NGK Insulators.

Despite their very low capital cost and high energy density (300-400 Wh/L), molten sodium–sulfur batteries have not achieved a wide-scale deployment yet compared to lithium-ion batteries: there have been ca. 200 installations, with a combined energy of 5 GWh and power of 0.72 GW, worldwide. vs. 948 GWh for lithium-ion batteries. Poor market adoption of molten sodium-sulfur batteries has possibly been due to perceived safety and durability issues, such as a short cycle life of fewer than 1000 cycles on average (although there are reports of 15 year operation with 300 cycles per year). In contrast to these concerns, a recent technical data sheet indicates a cycle life of 20 years or 7300 cycles with less than 1% energy degradation per year. Also TÜV Rheinland assessed commercial NaS batteries and their safety features coming to the conclusion that &quot;under practical conditions it is not possible to ignite an intact NGK Insulators NaS battery module (manufactured after 2011) or to trigger other dangerous scenarios from the outside or from within.&quot;

Like many high-temperature batteries, sodium–sulfur cells become more economical with increasing size. This is because of the square–cube law: large cells have less relative heat loss, so maintaining their high operating temperatures is easier. Commercially available cells are typically large with high capacities (up to 500 Ah).

A similar type of battery called the ZEBRA battery, which uses a / catholyte in place of molten sodium polysulfide, has had greater commercial interest in the past, but there are no commercial manufacturers of ZEBRA. Room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries are also known. They use neither liquid sodium nor liquid sulfur nor sodium beta-alumina solid electrolyte, but rather operate on entirely different principles and face different challenges than the high-temperature molten NaS batteries discussed here.

==Construction==
Typical batteries have a solid electrolyte membrane between the anode and cathode, compared with liquid-metal batteries where the anode, the cathode and the membrane are liquids.

The cell is usually made in a cylindrical configuration. The entire cell is enclosed by a steel casing that is protected, usually by chromium and molybdenum, from corrosion on the inside. This outside container serves as the positive electrode, while the liquid sodium serves as the negative electrode. The container is sealed at the top with an airtight alumina lid. An essential part of the cell is the presence of a BASE (beta-alumina solid electrolyte) membrane, which selectively conducts Na+. In commercial applications the cells are arranged in blocks for better heat conservation and are encased in a vacuum-insulated box.

For operation, the entire battery must be heated to, or above, the melting point of sulfur at 119 °C. Sodium has a lower melting point, around 98 °C, so a battery that holds molten sulfur holds molten sodium by default. This presents a serious safety concern; sodium can spontaneously ignite in air, and sulfur is highly flammable. Several examples of the Ford Ecostar, equipped with such a battery, burst into flame during recharging, leading Ford to abandon the attempted development of molten NaS batteries for cars. Stationary NaS batteries by NGK Insulators use hermetically sealed cells and multiple safety features on module level, such as sand for fire suppression. According to the manufacturer, these are sufficient to avoid that a fire can spread from one to neighboring cells.

==Operation==
During the discharge phase, molten elemental sodium at the core serves as the anode, meaning that the Na donates electrons to the external circuit. The sodium is separated by a beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) cylinder from the container of molten sulfur, which is fabricated from an inert metal serving as the cathode. The sulfur is absorbed in a carbon sponge.

BASE is a good conductor of sodium ions above 250 °C, but a poor conductor of electrons, and thus avoids self-discharge. Sodium metal does not fully wet the BASE below 400 °C due to a layer of oxide(s) separating them; this temperature can be lowered to 300 °C by coating the BASE with certain metals and/or by adding oxygen getters to the sodium, but even so wetting will fail below 200 °C. Before the cell can begin operation, it must be heated, which creates extra costs. To tackle this challenge, case studies to couple sodium–sulfur batteries to thermal solar energy systems. The heat energy collected from the sun would be used to pre-heat the cells and maintain the high temperatures for short periods between use. Once running, the heat produced by charging and discharging cycles is sufficient to maintain operating temperatures and usually no external source is required.

When sodium gives off an electron, the Na+ ion migrates to the sulfur container. The electron drives an electric current through the molten sodium to the contact, through the electrical load and back to the sulfur container. Here, another electron reacts with sulfur to form Sn2−, sodium polysulfide. The discharge process can be represented as follows:

:2 Na + 4 S → Na2S4 (Ecell ~ 2 V)

As the cell discharges, the sodium level drops. During the charging phase the reverse process takes place.

==Safety==
Pure sodium presents a hazard, because it spontaneously burns in contact with air and moisture, thus safety features are required to avoid direct contact with water and oxidizing atmospheres.

===2011 Tsukuba Plant fire incident===
Early on the morning of September 21, 2011, a 2000 kilowatt NaS battery system manufactured by NGK Insulators, owned by Tokyo Electric Power Company used for storing electricity and installed at the Tsukuba, Japan Mitsubishi Materials Corporation plant caught fire. Following the incident, NGK temporarily suspended production of NaS batteries. According to a report by TÜV Rheinland additional safety measures were adopted afterwards: &quot;NGK implemented additional safety measures on module and battery level, additional automated quality controls were introduced during cell production, the number of cells per module was reduced and additional fuses installed. The interconnection/wiring of the cells was changed so that in case of an internal short-circuit (e.g. due to leakage of conductive material from a cell) subsequent propagation with serious consequences can be reasonably ruled out. The additional safety measures implemented mean that the occurrence of incidents with consequences similar to those which occurred in 2011 and earlier (thermal runaway of complete modules, fires) can reasonably be excluded.&quot; 

==Development==

===United States===
Ford Motor Company pioneered the battery in the 1960s to power early-model electric cars. In 1989 Ford resumed its work on a Na-S battery powered electric car, which was named Ford Ecostar. The car had a 100-mile driving range, which was twice as much as any other fully electric car demonstrated earlier. 68 of such vehicles were leased to United Parcel Service, Detroit Edison Company, US Post Office, Southern California Edison, Electric Power Research Institute, and California Air Resources Board. Despite the low materials cost, these batteries were expensive to produce, as the economy of scale was not achieved during that time. Also, the battery life was estimated to be only 2 years. However, the program was terminated in 1995, after two of the leased car batteries caught fire.

, a lower temperature, solid electrode version was under development in Utah by Ceramatec. They use a NASICON membrane to allow operation at 90 °C with all components remaining solid.

In 2014, researchers identified a liquid sodium–caesium alloy that operates at 150 °C and produces 420 milliampere-hours per gram. The material fully coated (&quot;wetted&quot;) the electrolyte. After 100 charge/discharge cycles, a test battery maintained about 97% of its initial storage capacity. The lower operating temperature allowed the use of a less-expensive polymer external casing instead of steel, offsetting some of the increased cost associated with using caesium.

===Japan===
The NaS battery was one of four battery types selected as candidates for intensive research by MITI as part of the &quot;Moonlight Project&quot; in 1980. This project sought to develop a durable utility power storage device meeting the criteria shown below in a 10-year project.
* 1,000 kW class
* 8 hour charge/8 hour discharge at rated load
* Efficiency of 70% or better
* Lifetime of 1,500 cycles or better
The other three were improved lead–acid, redox flow (vanadium type), and zinc–bromine batteries.

A consortium formed by TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Co.) and NGK Insulators Ltd. declared their interest in researching the NaS battery in 1983, and became the primary drivers behind the development of this type ever since. TEPCO chose the NaS battery because all its component elements (sodium, sulfur, and alumina) are abundant in Japan. The first large-scale field testing took place at TEPCO&#x27;s Tsunashima substation between 1993 and 1996, using 3 x 2 MW, 6.6 kV battery banks. Based on the findings from this trial, improved battery modules were developed and were made commercially available in 2000. The commercial NaS battery bank offers:
* Capacity: 25–250 kWh per bank
* Efficiency of 87%
* Lifetime of 2,500 cycles at 100% depth of discharge (DOD), or 4,500 cycles at 80% DOD

A demonstration project used NaS battery at Japan Wind Development Co.&#x27;s Miura Wind Park in Japan.

Japan Wind Development opened a 51 MW wind farm that incorporates a 34 MW sodium-sulfur battery system at Futamata in Aomori Prefecture in May 2008.

As of 2007, 165 MW of capacity were installed in Japan. NGK announced in 2008 a plan to expand its NaS factory output from 90 MW a year to 150 MW a year.

In 2010, Xcel Energy announced that it would test a wind farm energy storage battery based on twenty 50 kW sodium–sulfur batteries. The 80 tonne, 2 semi-trailer sized battery is expected to have 7.2 MW·h of capacity at a charge and discharge rate of 1 MW. Since then, NGK announced several large-scale deployments including a virtual plant distributed on 10 sites in UAE totaling 108 MW/648 MWh in 2019.

In March 2011, Sumitomo Electric Industries and Kyoto University announced that they had developed a low temperature molten sodium ion battery that can output power at under 100 °C. The batteries have double the energy density of Li-ion and considerably lower cost. Sumitomo Electric Industry CEO Masayoshi Matsumoto indicated that the company planned to begin production in 2015. Initial applications are envisaged to be buildings and buses.

===Challenges===
Molten sodium beta-alumina batteries failed to meet the durability and safety expectations, that were the basis of several commercialization attempts in the 1980s. A characteristic lifetime of NaS batteries was determined as 1,000-2,000 cycles in a Weibull distribution with k=0.5.
There are several degradation pathways:
# During charge, sodium metal dendrites tend to form (slowly after several cycles) and propagate (rather quickly once they nucleate) into the intergrain boundaries in the solid beta-alumina electrolyte, eventually leading to internal short-circuiting and immediate failure. In general, a significant threshold current density needs to be exceeded before such rapid Mode I fracture-degradation is initiated.
# Beta-alumina surface layer on the Na side turns grey after &gt; 100 cycles. This is caused by a slower growth of micron-size sodium metal globules in the triple-junctions between the grains of the solid electrolyte. This process is possible, because the electronic conductivity of beta-alumina is small but not zero. The formation of such sodium metal globules gradually increases the electronic conductivity of the electrolyte and causes electronic leakage and self-discharge;
# Darkening of the beta-alumina also occurs on the sulfur side upon passing electric current, albeit at a slower schedule that the darkening on the sodium side. It is believed to be due to the deposition of carbon, which is added to the bulk sulfur to provide electronic conductivity.
# Oxygen depletion in the alumina near the sodium electrode has been suggested as a possible cause for the following crack formation.
# Disproportionation of sulfur into aluminium sulfate and sodium polysulfide has been suggested as a degradation pathway. This mechanism is not mentioned in later publications.
# Passing current (e.g. &gt;1 A/cm2) through beta-alumina can cause temperature gradient (e.g. &gt; 50 °C/ 2 mm) in the electrolyte, which in turn results in a thermal stress.

==Applications==

===Grid and standalone systems===

NaS batteries can be deployed to support the electric grid, or for stand-alone renewable power applications. Under some market conditions, NaS batteries provide value via energy arbitrage (charging battery when electricity is abundant/cheap, and discharging into the grid when electricity is more valuable) and voltage regulation. NaS batteries are a possible energy storage technology to support renewable energy generation, specifically wind farms and solar generation plants. In the case of a wind farm, the battery would store energy during times of high wind but low power demand. This stored energy could then be discharged from the batteries during peak load periods. In addition to this power shifting, sodium-sulfur batteries could be used to assist in stabilizing the power output of the wind farm during wind fluctuations. These types of batteries present an option for energy storage in locations where other storage options are not feasible. For example, pumped-storage hydroelectricity facilities require significant space and water resources, while compressed-air energy storage (CAES) requires some type of geologic feature such as a salt cave.

In 2016, the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation commissioned the world&#x27;s largest sodium–sulfur battery in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The facility offers energy storage to help manage energy levels during peak times with renewable energy sources.

===Space===
Because of its high energy density, the NaS battery has been proposed for space applications. Sodium–sulfur cells can be made space-qualified: in fact a test sodium-sulfur cell flew on the Space Shuttle. The NaS flight experiment demonstrated a battery with a specific energy of 150 W·h/kg (3 x nickel–hydrogen battery energy density), operating at 350 °C. It was launched on the STS-87 mission in November 1997, and demonstrated 10 days of experimental operation.

The Venus Landsailing Rover mission concept is also considering the use of this type of battery, as the rover and its payload are being designed to function for about 50 days on the hot surface of Venus without a cooling system.

===Transport and heavy machinery===
The first large-scale use of sodium–sulfur batteries was in the Ford &quot;Ecostar&quot; demonstration vehicle, an electric vehicle prototype in 1991. The high operating temperature of sodium-sulfur batteries presented difficulties for electric vehicle use, however. The Ecostar never went into production.

===Room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries===
One of the main shortcomings of traditional sodium–sulfur batteries is that they require high temperatures to operate. This means that they must be preheated before use, and that they will consume some of their stored energy (up to 14%) to maintain this temperature when not in use. Aside from saving energy, room temperature operation mitigates safety issues such as explosions which can occur due to failure of the solid electrolyte during operation at high temperatures. Research and development of sodium–sulfur batteries that can operate at room temperature is ongoing. Despite the higher theoretical energy density of sodium–sulfur cells at room temperature compared to high temperature, operation at room temperature introduces challenges like:

* Poor conductivity of sulfur and sodium polysulfides
* Volume expansion of sulfur, which creates mechanical stresses within the battery
* Low reaction rates between the sodium and sulfur
* Formation of dendrites on the sodium anode which create short-circuits in the battery. This is contributed to by the shuttle effect which is explained below.
* Shorter cycle life which means that the cells must be replaced more often than their high-temperature counterparts.

====The Shuttle Effect====
The shuttle effect in sodium–sulfur batteries leads to a loss of capacity, which can be defined as a reduction in the amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery. When the battery is being discharged, sodium ions react with sulfur (which is in the S8 form) at the cathode to form polysulfides in the following steps:

The problem occurs when the soluble polysulfide forms migrate to the anode, where they form the insoluble polysulfides. These insoluble polysulfides form as dendrites on the anode which can damage the battery and interfere with the movement of sodium ions into the electrolyte. Furthermore, the insoluble polysulfides at the anode cannot be converted back into sulfur when the battery is being recharged, which means that less sulfur is available for the battery to function (capacity loss). Research is being conducted into how the shuttle effect can be avoided.

<doc id="727245" wikidata="Q1456639" url="?curid=727245" title="Pseudomorph">
<text>In mineralogy, a pseudomorph is a mineral or mineral compound that appears in an atypical form (crystal system), resulting from a substitution process in which the appearance and dimensions remain constant, but the original mineral is replaced by another due to alteration, or chemical substitution, dissolution and refilling, structural changes or incrustation. The name literally means &quot;false form&quot;. Terminology for pseudomorphs is &quot;&quot;replacer&quot; after &quot;original&quot;&quot;, as in &quot;brookite&quot; after &quot;rutile&quot;. The term &quot;pseudomorphoses&quot; was initially used by Haüy.

==Substitution pseudomorph==
A substitution pseudomorph is a pseudomorph in which one mineral or other material is replaced by another. The original shape of the mineral remains unchanged, but chemical composition, color, hardness, and other properties change to those of the replacing mineral. 

This happens typically when a mineral of one composition changes by chemical reaction to another of similar composition, retaining the original crystalline shape. It can occur due to the loss of water or through the action of atmospheric agents, such as oxidation, hydration, or carbonation. An example is a change from galena (lead sulfide) to anglesite (lead sulfate) by oxidation. Pyrite crystals transformed into limonite, a compact mixture of iron oxides where goethite generally predominates, are common. In some cases, only partial replacement occurs. The resulting pseudomorph may contain an unaltered core of galena surrounded by anglesite that has the cubic crystal shape of galena.

==Infiltration pseudomorph==

An example of this process is the replacement of wood by silica (quartz or opal) to form petrified wood in which the substitution may be so perfect as to retain the original cellular structure of the wood. An example of mineral-to-mineral substitution is replacement of aragonite twin crystals by native copper, as occurs at the Corocoro United Copper Mines of Coro Coro, Bolivia.

==Paramorph==

A paramorph (also called allomorph) is a mineral changed on the molecular level only when the structure of a mineral transitions to a more stable polymorph. It has the same chemical composition, but with a different structure. For example, the cubic form of silver sulfide, argentite, does not actually exist below 173°C, and all are pseudomorphized into the monoclinic mineral acanthite. When the structure is very different, as in the aragonite and calcite, the unstable mineral can remains indefinitely in a metastable form, although transformation can occur under some conditions. Usually, the mineral looks identical to the original, unaltered form. 

==Epimorph and incrustation pseudomorph==
An incrustation pseudomorph, also called epimorph, results from a process by which a mineral is coated by another and the encased mineral dissolves. The encasing mineral remains, and retains the shape of the original mineral or material. Alternatively, another mineral may fill the space (the mold) previously occupied by some other mineral or material. Examples of quartz epimorph after calcite are found in the La Viesca Mine, Siero (Asturias), Spain. 

==In other fields==

Pseudomorphs are also common in paleontology. Fossils are often formed by pseudomorphic replacement of the remains by mineral matter. Examples include petrified wood and pyritized gastropod shells.

In biology, a pseudomorph is a cloud of mucus-rich ink released by many species of cephalopod. The name refers to the similarity in appearance between the cephalopod that released it and the cloud itself, in this context meaning literally &quot;false body&quot;. This behaviour often allows the cephalopod to escape from predation unharmed, and is often performed as part of what is known as the blanch-ink-jet maneuver.

In philosophy, the concept of pseudomorphosis was used by the German philosopher Oswald Spengler to describe how the forms of an older, more widely dispersed culture affect the expression of forms of a younger, emerging culture. The latter develop into forms that are fundamentally alien to the culture&#x27;s own world-feeling and thereby prevent it from fully developing its own self-consciousness.

In archaeology, organic pseudomorphs are impressions of organic material that can accumulate on the surface of metal artifacts as they corrode. They may occur when metal artifacts are buried in contact with organics under damp soil.

<text>The European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) is a European political party with Christian democratic, liberal-conservative, and conservative member parties. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties. Founded by primarily Christian-democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives. On 31 May 2022, the party elected as its President Manfred Weber, who was also EPP&#x27;s &quot;Spitzenkandidat&quot; in 2019.

The EPP has been the largest party in the European Parliament since 1999 and in the European Council since 2002. It is also the largest party in the current European Commission. The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola are from the EPP. Many of the founding fathers of the European Union were also from parties that later formed the EPP.

The EPP includes major centre-right parties such as the CDU/CSU of Germany, ÖVP of Austria, HDZ of Croatia, PNL of Romania, Fine Gael of Ireland, National Coalition Party of Finland, New Democracy of Greece, the Moderates of Sweden, the People&#x27;s Party (PP) of Spain, the Civic Platform of Poland, the Social Democratic Party of Portugal and the Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria.

== History ==

According to its website, the EPP is &quot;the family of the political centre-right, whose roots run deep in the history and civilisation of the European continent, and [which] has pioneered the European project from its inception&quot;.

The EPP was founded in Luxembourg on 8 July 1976 on the initiative of Jean Seitlinger; Leo Tindemans, then Prime Minister of Belgium, who became the first President of the EPP; and Wilfried Martens, who later became both President of the EPP and Prime Minister of Belgium. It had been preceded by the &quot;Secretariat International des partis démocratiques d&#x27;inspiration chrétienne&quot;, founded in 1925, the &quot;Nouvelles Equipes Internationales&quot;, founded in 1946 (or 1948), and the European Union of Christian Democrats, founded in 1965.

In the late 1990s, the Finnish politician Sauli Niinistö negotiated the merger of the European Democrat Union (EDU), of which he was president, into the EPP. In October 2002, the EDU ceased its activities after being formally absorbed by the EPP at a special event in Estoril, Portugal. In recognition of his efforts, Niinistö was elected Honorary President of the EPP the same year.

The EPP has had seven Presidents:


== Platform and manifesto ==
=== Political manifesto and platform ===
During its Congress in Bucharest in 2012, the EPP updated its political platform after 20 years (since its Congress in Athens in 1992) and approved a political manifesto in which it summarised its main values and policies.

The manifesto highlights:
* Freedom as a central human right, coupled with responsibility
* Respect for traditions and associations
* Solidarity to help those in need, who in turn should also make an effort to improve their situation
* Ensuring solid public finances
* Preserving a healthy environment
* Subsidiarity
* Pluralist democracy and a social market economy

The manifesto also describes the EPP&#x27;s priorities for the EU, including:
* European Political Union
* Direct election of the President of the European Commission
* Completion of the European Single Market
* Promotion of the family, improvements in education and health
* Strengthening of the common immigration and asylum policy, and integrating immigrants
* Continuation of enlargement of the EU, enhancement of the European Neighbourhood Policy and special relationship frameworks for countries that cannot, or do not want to, join the EU
* Defining a truly common EU energy policy
* Strengthening European political parties

=== Electoral manifesto ===
As a central part of its campaign for the European elections in 2009, the EPP approved its election manifesto at its Congress in Warsaw in April that year. The manifesto called for:
* Creation of new jobs, continuing reforms and investment in education, lifelong learning, and employment to create opportunities for everyone.
*Avoidance of protectionism, and coordination of fiscal and monetary policies.
*Increased transparency and surveillance in financial markets.
*Making Europe the market leader in green technology.
*Increasing the share of renewable energy to at least 20 percent of the energy mix by 2020.
*Family-friendly flexibility for working parents, better child care and housing, family-friendly fiscal policies, encouragement of parental leave.
*A new strategy to attract skilled workers from the rest of the world to make Europe&#x27;s economy more competitive, more dynamic and more knowledge-driven.
=== The Fidesz crisis ===
Concerns that the Hungarian ruling party Fidesz and its leader Viktor Orbán were undermining the rule of law in Hungary caused a split in the EPP in the run-up of the 2019 European Parliament election. On one hand, the EPP had been reluctant for years to address Fidesz&#x27;s stance against the rule of law, expressed by the Article 7 proceedings of the European Parliament. On the other hand, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a prominent EPP-member, stated &quot;I believe his [Fidesz&#x27;s] place is not in the European People&#x27;s Party&quot;. Orbán&#x27;s campaigns targeting billionaire George Soros and Jean-Claude Juncker carried wide reverberations for Europe questioning the EPP&#x27;s effort to install its lead candidate Manfred Weber as the next President of the European Commission.

After years of deferring a decision about the Fidesz issue, the EPP was eventually compelled to address the problem two months before the 2019 European elections, as 13 outraged member parties requested the Hungarian party&#x27;s exclusion from the EPP due to its billboard campaign featuring Jean-Claude Juncker. 190 of the 193 EPP delegates supported the common agreement with Fidesz on 20 March 2019 to partially suspend its membership. According to it, Fidesz was &quot;until further notice&quot; excluded from EPP meetings and internal elections, but remained in the European People&#x27;s Party Group of the European Parliament. Fidesz did not deliver on its earlier promise to leave the EPP in case of a penalty.

In February 2020, the EPP extended the suspension of Fidesz indefinitely.

On 2 April 2020, thirteen parties within the EPP issued a joint statement aimed at Donald Tusk, asking him to expunge Fidesz from the party. Three days before this, the Hungarian Parliament had passed a law, declaring a state of emergency within Hungary, granting Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the right to rule by decree.

On 3 March 2021, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced that Fidesz would leave the EPP group after it changed its internal rules (to allow suspension and expulsion of multiple deputies and their groups), although Fidesz remained a suspended member of the EPP itself. On 18 March 2021, Fidesz decided to leave the European People&#x27;s Party.

In June 2024, The Hungarian Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (KDNP), who serve in government with Fidesz, left the European People&#x27;s Party. That same month, members of the newly elected Hungarian Tisza Party led by Peter Magyar, a former Fidesz insider, applied to join EPP.

=== German investigation ===
In April 2023, Belgian police and German investigators carried out a raid at the EPP headquarters in Brussels as part of an investigation in Germany.

== Membership ==
Within the EPP there are three kinds of member organisations: full members, associate members and observers. Full members are parties from EU states. They have absolute rights to vote in all the EPP&#x27;s organs and on all matters. Associate members have the same voting rights as full members except for matters concerning the EU&#x27;s structure or policies. These associate members are parties from EU candidate countries and EFTA countries. Observer parties can participate in all the activities of the EPP, and attend the Congresses and Political Assemblies, but they do not have any voting rights.

Special status of &quot;supporting member&quot; is granted by the Presidency to individuals and associations. Although they do not have voting rights, they can be invited by the President to attend meetings of certain organs of the party.

=== EPP Political Assembly ===
The Political Assembly defines the political positions of the EPP between Congresses and decides on membership applications, political guidelines and the budget. The Political Assembly is composed of designated delegates from EPP member parties, associated parties, member associations, and other affiliated groups. The Political Assembly meets at least three times a year.

=== Congress ===
The Congress is the highest decision-making body of the EPP. It is composed of delegates from member parties, EPP associations, EPP Group MEPs, the EPP Presidency, national heads of party and government, and European Commissioners who belong to a member party, with the numbers of delegates being weighted according to the EPP&#x27;s share of MEPs, and individual delegates being elected by member parties according to member parties&#x27; rules.

Under the EPP&#x27;s statutes, the Congress must meet once every three years, but it also meets normally during the years of elections for the European Parliament (every five years), and extraordinary Congresses have also been summoned. The Congress elects the EPP Presidency every three years, decides on the main policy documents and electoral programmes, and provides a platform for the EPP&#x27;s heads of government and party leaders.

== Activities within the party ==
=== Summit ===

EPP leaders meet for the EPP Summit a few hours before each meeting of the European Council in order to formulate common positions. Invitations are sent by the EPP President and attendees include, besides the members of the EPP&#x27;s presidency, all Presidents and Prime Ministers who are members of the European Council and belong to the EPP; the Presidents of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council, as well as the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, provided that they belong to the EPP; Deputy Prime Ministers or other ministers in those cases where the Prime Minister of a country does not belong to an EPP member party; and, where no EPP member party is part of a government, the leaders of the main EPP opposition party.

=== Ministerial meetings ===
Following the pattern of the EPP Summit the party also organises regular EPP Ministerial meetings before each meeting of the Council of the European Union, with ministers, deputy ministers, secretaries of state and MEPs in the specific policy field attending:
* General Affairs
* Foreign Affairs
* Economy and Finance
* Home Affairs
* Justice
* Defence
* Employment and Social Affairs
* Industry
* Agriculture
* Energy
* Environment

=== Other activities ===
The EPP also organises working groups on different issues on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, as well as meetings with its affiliated members in the European Commission. It also invites individual Commissioners to the EPP Summit meetings and to EPP Ministerial meetings.

Following amendments to the EU Regulation that governs European political parties in 2007, the EPP, like the other European parties, was responsible for organising a pan-European campaign for the European elections every five years. According to the Lisbon Treaty, the parties must present candidates for President of the European Commission, but the EPP had already done this by endorsing José Manuel Barroso for a second term in April 2009.

The year 2014 saw the first fully-fledged campaign of the EPP ahead of the European elections of that year. The party nominated former Luxembourgish Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker as its candidate for President of the European Commission and led a pan-European campaign in coordination with the national campaigns of all its member parties.

== Activities within EU institutions ==
As of 1 December 2019, the EPP holds the Presidency of the European Commission with Ursula von der Leyen (CDU).

=== Overview of European institutions ===

She was endorsed by the European Council and elected by an absolute majority in the European Parliament. On 1 December 2019, the von der Leyen Commission officially took office. It includes 11 EPP officeholders out of 27 total Commissioners.

Through its associate and observer parties the EPP has five head of state or government in non-EU countries:

=== In the Council of Europe ===
The Group of the EPP in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe defends freedom of expression and information, as well as freedom of movement of ideas and religious tolerance. It promotes the principle of subsidiarity and local autonomy, as well as the defence of national, social, and other minorities. The EPP/CD Group is led by Davor Ivo Stier, a member of the Croatian Democratic Union.

The EPP/CD group also includes members from parties that are not related to the EPP itself, including members of the Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein), the Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party (Liechtenstein), and the National and Democratic Union (Monaco).

=== In the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ===
The &quot;EPP and like-minded Group&quot; in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is the most active political group in that body. The Group meets regularly and promotes the EPP&#x27;s positions. The members of the EPP Group also participate in the election-monitoring missions of the OSCE.

The Group is chaired by Walburga Habsburg Douglas (Sweden), and its Vice-Presidents are Consiglio Di Nino (Canada), Vilija Aleknaitė Abramikiene (Lithuania), Laura Allegrini (Italy), and George Tsereteli (Georgia).

Among them are members of the Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein), the Union for the Principality (Monaco), the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party of Canada, and the Republican Party of the United States.

=== In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ===
The EPP is also present and active in the Parliamentary Assembly of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and forms the &quot;EPP and Associated Members&quot; Group there. It is led by the German CDU politician Karl Lamers, who is also the current President of the Assembly. The Group also included members of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Republican Party of the United States, but now they are members of the Conservative Group
=== Relations with the United States ===
The EPP has close relations with the International Republican Institute (IRI), an organisation funded by the U.S. government especially to promote democracy and democratisation. The EPP and the IRI cooperate within the framework of the European Partnership Initiative.

The EPP&#x27;s late President, Wilfried Martens, endorsed Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, in the presidential election in 2008. McCain was also Chairman of the IRI. In 2011 Martens and McCain made joint press statements expressing their concern about the state of democracy in Ukraine.

=== Global networks ===
The EPP is the European wing of two global centre-right organisations, the International Democracy Union (IDU) and the Centrist Democrat International (CDI).

== Martens Centre ==
Following the revision in 2007 of the EU Regulation that governs European political parties, allowing the creation of affiliated European political foundations, the EPP established in the same year its official foundation/think tank, the Centre for European Studies (CES), which was later renamed as the Martens Centre. It includes as members all the major national think tanks and foundations affiliated to EPP member parties: the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (CDU), the Hanns Seidel Foundation (CSU), the Foundation for Analysis and Social Studies (PP), the Constantinos Karamanlis Institute for Democracy (ND), the Jarl Hjalmarson Foundation (MOD), the Political Academy of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) and others. During the European Parliament election campaign in 2009, the Centre launched a web-based campaign module, &quot;tellbarroso.eu&quot;, to support Jose Manuel Barroso, the EPP&#x27;s candidate for re-election as Commission President.

In 2014, to honour Wilfried Martens – the late President of the EPP who also founded the CES – changed its name to Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies or simply Martens Centre.

The current President of the Martens Centre is former Slovak Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda.

The Budapest-based Robert Schuman Institute and the Luxembourg-based Robert Schuman Foundation are also affiliated with the European People&#x27;s Party.

== EPP associations ==
The EPP is linked to several specific associations that focus on specific groups and organise seminars, forums, publications, and other activities.

=== Small and Medium Entrepreneurs Europe (SME Europe) ===
SME Europe is the official business organisation of the EPP and serves as a network for pro-business politicians and political organisations. Its main objective is to shape EU policy in a more SME-friendly way in close cooperation with the SME Circle of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, the DG Enterprise and the pro-business organisations of the EPP&#x27;s member parties. Its top priorities are to reform the legal framework for SMEs all over Europe and to promote and support the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises. SME Europe was founded in May 2012 by three Members of the European Parliament, Paul Rübig, Nadezhda Neynsky, and Bendt Bendtsen.

=== European Democrat Students ===
European Democrat Students (EDS) is now the official students&#x27; organisation of the EPP, though it was founded in 1961, 15 years before the EPP itself. Led by Virgilio Falco, EDS has 40 member organisations, representing nearly 1,600,000 students and young people in 31 countries, including Belarus and Georgia. Every year EDS hosts Summer and Winter &quot;universities&quot;, and several seminars. It also regularly publishes a magazine, &quot;Bullseye&quot;, and organises topical campaigns.

=== Women of the European People&#x27;s Party ===
The Women of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP Women) is recognised by the EPP as the official association of women from all like-minded political parties of Europe.
