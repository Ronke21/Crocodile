<text>On 26 April 1937, the Basque town of Guernica (&quot;Gernika&quot; in Basque) was aerially bombed during the Spanish Civil War. It was carried out at the behest of Francisco Franco&#x27;s rebel Nationalist faction by its allies, the Nazi German Luftwaffe&#x27;s Condor Legion and the Fascist Italian Aviazione Legionaria, under the code name Operation Rügen. The town was being used as a communications centre by Republican forces just behind the front line, and the raid was intended to destroy bridges and roads. The operation opened the way to Franco&#x27;s capture of Bilbao and his victory in northern Spain.

The attack gained controversy because it involved the bombing of civilians by a military air force. Seen as a war crime by some historians, and argued as a legitimate attack by others, it was one of the first aerial bombings to capture global attention. Under the international laws regarding aerial warfare in 1937, Guernica was a legitimate military target. The number of victims is still disputed; the Basque government reported 1,654 people killed at the time, while local historians identified 126 victims (later revised by the authors of the study to 153). A British source used by the USAF Air War College claims 400 civilians died. Soviet archives claim 800 deaths on 1 May 1937, but this number may not include victims who later died of their injuries in hospitals or whose bodies were discovered buried in the rubble.

The bombing is the subject of the anti-war painting &quot;Guernica&quot; by Pablo Picasso, which was commissioned by the Spanish Republic. It was also depicted in a woodcut by the German artist Heinz Kiwitz, who was later killed fighting in the International Brigades, and by René Magritte in the painting &quot;Le Drapeau Noir&quot;. The bombing shocked and inspired many other artists, including a sculpture by René Iché, one of the first electroacoustic music pieces by Patrick Ascione, musical compositions by Octavio Vazquez (&quot;Gernika&quot; Piano Trio), René-Louis Baron and Mike Batt (performed by Katie Melua), and poems by Paul Eluard (&quot;Victory of Guernica&quot;), and Uys Krige (&quot;Nag van die Fascistiese Bomwerpers&quot;, English translation from the Afrikaans: &quot;Night of the Fascist Bombers&quot;). There is also a short film from 1950 by Alain Resnais titled &quot;Guernica&quot;.

==Background==
Guernica (Gernika in Basque; officially Gernika-Lumo), in the Basque province of Biscay, and 30 kilometres east of Bilbao, has long been a centre of great significance to the Basque people. Its &quot;Gernikako Arbola&quot; (&quot;the tree of Gernika&quot; in Basque) is an oak tree that symbolises traditional freedoms for the Biscayan people and, by extension, for the Basque people as a whole. Guernica was considered a key part of the Basques&#x27; national identity; it was long celebrated as &quot;the home of Basque liberties&quot;. Guernica was also the location of the Spanish weapons manufacturer Astra-Unceta y Cía, which had been a supplier of firearms to the Spanish military and police forces since 1912. At the time of the bombing, the population of Guernica was 7,000 people, and the battlefront was 30 kilometres away.

===Military situation===

Advances by Nationalist troops led by Generalísimo Francisco Franco had eaten into the territory controlled by the Republican Government. The Basque Government, an autonomous regional administrative body formed by Basque nationalists, sought to defend Biscay and parts of Guipuzcoa with its own light Basque Army. At the time of the raid, Guernica represented a focal strategic point for the Republican forces. It stood between the Nationalists and capture of Bilbao. Bilbao was seen as key to bringing the war to a conclusion in the north of Spain. Guernica also was the path of retreat for the Republicans from the northeast of Biscay.

Prior to the Condor Legion raid, the town had not been directly involved in the fighting, although Republican forces were in the area; 23 battalions of Basque army troops were at the front east of Guernica. The town also housed two Basque army battalions, although it had no static air defenses, and it was thought that no air cover could be expected due to recent losses of the Republican Air Force.

===Market day===
Monday 26 April was market day; there were more than 10,000 people in the former Basque capital. Generally speaking, a market day would have attracted people from the surrounding areas to Guernica to conduct business. Market days consisted of local farmers bringing in their crops to sell to the village people. They would bring the crops of the week&#x27;s labour to the main square, which is where the market was held.

There is a historical debate over whether a market was being held that particular Monday as, prior to the bombing, the Basque government had ordered a general halt to markets to prevent congestion of roads, and restricted large meetings. It is accepted by most historians that Monday &quot;...would have been a market day.&quot;

==Luftwaffe doctrine, 1933–1942==
James Corum states that a prevalent view about the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and its &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; operations was that it had a doctrine of terror bombing, in which civilians were deliberately targeted in order to break the will or aid the collapse of an enemy. After the bombing of Guernica in 1937, Wieluń and Warsaw in 1939, and Rotterdam in 1940, it was commonly assumed that terror bombing was a part of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; doctrine. During the interwar period the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; leadership officially rejected the concept of terror bombing, but continued to allow bombings which might result in heavy civilian casualties:

General Walther Wever compiled a doctrine known as &quot;The Conduct of the Aerial War&quot; in 1935. In this document, which the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; adopted, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; rejected Giulio Douhet&#x27;s theory of terror bombing. Terror bombing was deemed to be &quot;counter-productive&quot;, increasing rather than destroying the enemy&#x27;s will to resist. Such bombing campaigns were regarded as a diversion from the &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; main operations, destruction of the enemy armed forces.

==The raid==

The Condor Legion was entirely under the command of the Nationalist forces. The order to perform the raid was transmitted to the commanding officer of the Condor Legion, Oberstleutnant Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, from the Spanish Nationalist Command.

===Mission planning===
While questions are often raised over the intent of the raid, the diaries of the planner and commander of the mission made public in the 1970s indicate that an attack on Guernica represented part of a wider Nationalist advance in the area and was also designed to support Franco&#x27;s forces already in place, a nationalist force of twenty five battalions. According to Payne:

Richthofen, understanding the strategic importance of the town in the advance on Bilbao and restricting Republican retreat, ordered an attack against the roads and bridge in the Renteria suburb. Destruction of the bridge was considered the primary objective since the raid was to operate in conjunction with Nationalist troop movements against Republicans around Marquina. Secondary objectives were restriction of Republican traffic/equipment movements and the prevention of bridge repair via the creation of rubble around the bridge.

On 22 March 1937, Franco started to put his plan into action, starting with his air chief, General Alfredo Kindelán. The German army would first take the Guadalajara front. Italians then would be restructured at Palencia. From there two new divisions were formed. General Emilio Mola would start the campaign against the north (Asturias, Santander and Biscay). All Nationalist equipment was sent to the north front to support Mola. The main reason to attack first from the north was the suspicion that a decisive victory could be won there quickly. Mola wanted to make this fight quick; he let the Basque people know that if they wanted to surrender he would spare their lives and homes. On 31 March Mola&#x27;s threat was put into action and the fighting began in Durango.

The Condor Legion persuaded Franco to send troops to go north and to be led by General Emilio Mola. On 31 March 1937, Mola attacked the province of Biscay, which included the bombing of Durango by the Condor Legion. Republicans put up a tough fight against the German troops but eventually were forced back. Many refugees fled to Guernica for safety, about a thousand people turned to Guernica. On 25 April, Mola sent a warning to Franco saying that he was planning a heavy strike against Guernica.

To meet these objectives, two Heinkel He 111s, one Dornier Do 17, eighteen Ju 52 &quot;Behelfsbomber&quot;, and three Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie were assigned for the mission. These were armed with medium high-explosive bombs, light explosive bombs and incendiaries. The ordnance load for the 24 bombers was in total. A follow-up to the bombing raid was also planned for the next day involving Messerschmitt Bf 109 raids in the area. The order was noted on 26 April by Richthofen as:

Starting at once: A/88 and J/88 for free fighter bomber mission on the streets near Marquina-Guernica-Guerriciaz. K/88 (after Returning from Guerriciaz), VB/88 and Italians for the streets and the bridge (including suburb) east of Guernica. There we have to close the traffic, if we finally want a decision against personnel and materiel of the enemy. Vigon agrees to move his troops for blocking all streets south of Guernica. If this succeeds, we will have trapped the enemy around Marquina.

===First five waves of raid===
The first wave arrived over Guernica around 16:30. A Dornier Do 17, coming from the south, dropped approximately twelve bombs.

The three Italian SM.79s had taken off from Soria at 15:30 with orders to &quot;bomb the road and bridge to the east of Guernica, in order to block the enemy retreat&quot; during the second wave. Their orders explicitly stated not to bomb the town itself. During a single 60-second pass over the town, from north to south, the SM.79s dropped thirty-six light explosive bombs. César Vidal says that at this point, the damage to the town was &quot;relatively limited... confined to a few buildings&quot;, including the church of San Juan and headquarters of the &quot;Izquierda Republicana&quot; (&quot;Republican Left&quot;) political party.

The next three waves of the first attack then occurred, ending around 18:00. The third wave consisted of a Heinkel He 111 escorted by five Regia Aeronautica Fiat CR.32 fighters led by Capitano Corrado Ricci. The fourth and fifth waves were carried out by German twin-engined planes. Vidal notes:

If the aerial attacks had stopped at that moment, for a town that until then had maintained its distance from the convulsions of war, it would have been a totally disproportionate and insufferable punishment. However, the biggest operation was yet to come.
===Subsequent raids===
Earlier, around noon that day, the Junkers Ju 52s of the Condor Legion had carried out a mission around Gerrikaraiz. Following this they landed to re-arm and then took off to complete the raid on Guernica. The attack would run from north to south, coming from the Bay of Biscay and up the course of the Urdaibai estuary.

The 1st and 2nd Squadrons of the Condor Legion took off at about 16:30, with the 3rd Squadron taking off from Burgos a few minutes later. They were escorted from Vitoria-Gasteiz by a squadron of Fiat fighters and Messerschmitt Bf 109Bs of Günther Lützow&#x27;s 2. &quot;Staffel&quot; (2nd Squadron) of Jagdgruppe 88 (J/88), for a total of twenty-nine planes. Lützow himself did not participate in the attack, he was on home leave from 8–29 April 1937.

===Outcome===
The bombing shattered the city&#x27;s defenders&#x27; will to resist, allowing the rebel Nationalists to overrun it. This indirectly supported Douhet&#x27;s theory, which predicted this result. The rebels faced little resistance and took complete control of the town by 29 April. The attacks destroyed the majority of Guernica. Three-quarters of the city&#x27;s buildings were reported completely destroyed, and most others sustained damage. Among infrastructure spared were the arms factories &quot;Unceta and Company&quot; and &quot;Talleres de Guernica&quot; along with the Assembly House &quot;Casa de Juntas&quot; and the Gernikako Arbola. Since the Luftwaffe was then operating on Wever&#x27;s theory of bombing as a military action, the mission was considered a failure as a result. However, the rubble and civil disorder that the raid created severely restricted the movement of Republican forces.

==Casualties==
The number of civilian fatalities is now set at between 170 and 300 people. Until the 1980s, it had been generally accepted that the number of deaths had been over 1,700, but these numbers are now known to have been exaggerated. Historians now agree that the number of deaths was under 300.

An early study by Gernikazarra Historia Taldea estimated the number of victims to be 126, later revised to 153, and is still considered by the organisation to be provisional. Those incomplete data roughly correspond to the mortuary records of the town that survived, and do not include the 592 deaths registered in Bilbao&#x27;s hospital. Raúl Arias Ramos in his book &quot;La Legión Cóndor en la Guerra Civil&quot; states that there were 250 dead. The study by Joan Villarroya and Josep M. Solé i Sabaté in their book &quot;España en Llamas: la Guerra Civil desde el Aire&quot; states that there were 300 dead. These studies, cited by historians such as Stanley Payne and Antony Beevor, as well as media such as the BBC and &quot;El Mundo&quot;, provide the currently recognized death toll in those numbers.

After Nationalist forces led by General Emilio Mola&#x27;s forces took the town three days later, the Nationalist side claimed that no effort to establish an accurate number had been made by the opposite side. The Basque government, in the confused aftermath of the raids, reported 1,654 dead and 889 wounded. Such a number roughly agreed with the testimony of British journalist George Steer, correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;, which estimated that 800 to 3,000 of 5,000 people perished in Guernica. These figures were adopted over the years by some commentators. These figures are represented in a majority of the literature from that period and up to the 1970s.

The Nationalist junta gave a patently false description of the events, claiming that the destruction had been caused by Republicans burning the town as they fled, and seemed to have made no effort to establish an accurate number. At an extreme low, the Francoist newspaper &quot;Arriba&quot; claimed, on 30 January 1970, that there had only been twelve deaths.

===Bombs to casualty ratio===

Issues with the originally released figures were raised following an appraisal of large scale bombing raids during the Second World War. A comparison of the Guernica figures with the figures of dead resulting from air attacks on major European cities during the Second World War exposed an anomaly. James Corum uses the figure of forty tons of bombs dropped on Guernica, and calculates that if the figure of 1654 dead is accepted as accurate, then the raid caused 41 fatalities per ton of bombs. By way of comparison, the Dresden air raid during February 1945, which saw 3,431 tons of bombs dropped on the city, caused fewer deaths per ton of bombs: 7.2–10.2 fatalities per ton of bombs dropped. Corum, who ascribes the discrepancy between the high death toll reported at Guernica and in other cases such as Rotterdam to propaganda, goes on to say that for Guernica:
...a realistic estimate on the high side of bombing effectiveness (7–12 fatalities per ton of bombs) would yield a figure of perhaps 300–400 fatalities in Guernica. This is certainly a bloody enough event, but reporting that a small town was bombed with a few hundred killed would not have had the same effect as reporting that a city was bombed with almost 1,700 dead&quot;.

==Media reporting==

=== English-language media ===
The first English-language media reports of the destruction in Guernica appeared two days later. George Steer, a reporter for &quot;The Times&quot;, who was covering the Spanish Civil War from inside the country, authored the first full account of events. Steer&#x27;s reporting set the tone for much of the subsequent reportage, with part of his report stating &quot;Guernica was not a military objective... The object of the bombardment was seemingly the demoralisation of the civil population and the destruction of the cradle of the Basque race.&quot; Steer also pointed out German complicity in the action, citing three small bomb cases stamped with the German Imperial Eagle as evidence. Steer&#x27;s report was syndicated to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and then worldwide, . There was coverage in other national and international editions also:
* The &quot;Times&quot; ran the story every day for over a week after the attack.
* The &quot;New York Post&quot; ran a cartoon showing Adolf Hitler brandishing a bloody sword labelled &quot;air raids&quot; as he towered over heaps of civilian dead littering &quot;the Holy City of Guernica&quot;.
* The US Congressional Record referred to poison gas having been dropped on Guernica. This did not actually occur.
* During debates in the British Parliament, Guernica was also inaccurately described as an &quot;open city&quot; which contained no military targets.

Noel Monks, an Australian correspondent in Spain for the London &quot;Daily Express&quot;, was the first reporter to arrive on the scene after the bombing. He received the following cable from his office, &quot;Berlin denies Guernica bombing. Franco says he had no planes up yesterday owing fog. Queipo de Llano says Reds dynamited Guernica during retreat.&quot;

Overall, the impression generated was one which fed the widely held public fear of air attack which had been building throughout the 1930s, a fear which accurately anticipated that in the next war the aerial forces of warring nations would be able to wipe whole cities off the map.

Stanley Payne observes that the presence of Steer was the reason for Guernica becoming a major media event; the town of Durango had been bombed a few days before and suffered higher casualties yet received comparatively little attention. Steer was first on the scene and was eager to dramatise the effect of bombing on cities in order to encourage war preparedness. Steer inflated the number of casualties by 1000%.

=== Republican media reporting ===
After the attack, José Antonio Aguirre published the following press note:

The Republican statement counted 1645 deaths and 889 wounded.

The attribution of responsibility is correct, the cause of the bombing is probably wrong but reasonable at the time, and machine gun fire was indeed used to create fires in the village. However, it contains lies and is intentionally misleading in various points. It suggests that the bombing was sustained through three hours, while three hours is the time between the first and last round among the three made on Guernica. The numbers of dead and injured have been now proven to be completely false and impossible for the size of the locality. The intentional, individual chase of civilians by German planes has not been disproven (nor proven) but has some problematic points in it. Some prestigious foreign journalists like Hemingway, Orwell and Saint-Exupéry reported it, but none of them actually saw it and have other proven inaccuracies in their accounts of the war. No material proofs of it had been found, and the streets of the village are far too narrow for the chase to take place. It is possible that the chase of civilians happened outside of the urban area as the population was fleeing from the bombs, but a generalized chase and murder of the witnesses seems like a pointless waste of resources, or even a counter producing action, if the goal of the German airforces was, as it is now believed, to extend demoralization and fear in the neighbouring villages.

=== Denial by Franco&#x27;s military board ===
On 27 April, the day after the bombing, Nationalist general Gonzalo Queipo de Llano broadcast a statement through Union Radio Seville accusing the local population and &quot;the reds&quot; of having deliberately burned and dynamited Guernica, while calling international reporters liars. Among the facts that he provided to prove his version of events were the &quot;absolute absence of German airforces&quot; and the bad weather.

On 29 April, in view of the outrage caused by the bombing in European public opinion, Franco&#x27;s propaganda service issued an official statement parroting Llano&#x27;s claims. This theory found favor in conservative British journals, including &quot;The Times,&quot; which even put in doubt the testimony from its own correspondent, George Steer. While Republican forces had pursued a scorched earth strategy in the past (notably in Irun, which was dynamited), Steer&#x27;s reporting was supported by other journalists who witnessed the same levels of destruction. Furthermore, there were objective proofs available at the time of the falsehood of Llano&#x27;s version: the bad weather he mentioned happened hours after the attack had been perpetrated, and the city&#x27;s weaponry as well as the bridge to get to it were among the few buildings which had not been destroyed.

The Germans denied any involvement, as well. Von Richthofen claimed that the Germans had a target that was a bridge over the Mundaka River, which was on the edge of town. It was chosen for the fact that it would cut off the fleeing Republican troops. However, even though the Germans had the best airmen and the best planes in Spain, none of their bombs hit the presumed target.

Some Nationalist reporters suggested that the town had been bombed from the air, but by Republican airplanes. The bombs were said to have been made in the Basque country and the explosions happened because of dynamite stored in the sewers. Another theory by Nationalists was that there were a &quot;few bomb fragments found&quot; in Guernica, but the damage was mainly caused by Basque incendiaries. Franco&#x27;s regime minimized the bombing for decades. In 1970, newspaper &quot;Arriba&quot; claimed that there had only been twelve deaths during the bombing raid.

The attempted cover-up did more harm than good. The uproar irritated even Hitler, who insisted that Franco&#x27;s government absolve the Condor Legion from any responsibility. Ironically, the whole affair may have redounded to his advantage, for it had the effect of heightening concern about the destructiveness of the Luftwaffe, a fear that encouraged appeasement of Germany. In the aftermath, Franco reiterated his earlier orders that no open town, without troops or military industry, may be bombed without a direct order from the Generalissimo or the commanding general of the air force.

==Views on the attack==
The attack has entered the lexicon of war as an example of terror bombing. It is also remembered by the surviving inhabitants and Basque people as such. Due to the lingering divisions from the conflict, the event remains a source of emotion and public recrimination.

===Military intentions===
A commonly held viewpoint is that the involvement of the Luftwaffe in the Civil War occurred because of shared anti-communism and to form a proving ground for troops employed later during World War II. This view is supported by the comments of then Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring at the Nuremberg Trials:
I urged him (Adolf Hitler) to give support [to Franco] under all circumstances, firstly, in order to prevent the further spread of communism in that theater and, secondly, to test my young Luftwaffe at this opportunity in this or that technical respect.

One historian claimed the Germans bombed Guernica in a deliberate attempt to destroy the entire town.

According to James Corum, while the popular view of the attack was a terror bombing aimed at the town, in reality the intended target was the bridge and roads. The issue was that pinpoint bombing was not possible at the time of the attack. Most of the bombers used by the Luftwaffe in Spain did not possess adequate targeting gear and thus the Condor Legion&#x27;s preferred solution was to carpet the area with bombs to ensure the targets would be hit. Corum also argues against the view that there was a psychological element to the attack, stating that Richtofen seemed unaware of the significance of Guernica to the Basques and his diary indicates he only cared that the attack had been able to shut down logistics in the town. The Nationalists also didn&#x27;t destroy the Basque parliament building or the Holy Oak, both of which had great cultural significance to the Basque and would have been excellent targets if the raid was meant solely to be a psychological warfare attack. Corum also argues that the attack on the town did not differ in style from the types of attacks the Allies conducted during World War II, and the Condor Legion regarded the attack as a routine tactical operation.

====Carpet bombing====
Alongside the potential for gains in combat experience it is also thought that various strategic initiatives were first tried as part of Luftwaffe involvement in the conflict. Theories on strategic bombing were first developed by the Luftwaffe with the first exhibition of &quot;carpet bombing&quot; in the September 1937 Asturias campaign. Comparisons between the raid on Guernica and the fate of other cities during the conflict are also telling. As the fighting progressed into March 1938, Italian pilots flying as Aviazione Legionaria were involved in thirteen raids against Barcelona involving fire and gas bombs.

The use of &quot;carpet bombing&quot; was becoming standard practice by Condor Legion personnel. To illustrate this point, military historian James Corum cites an excerpt from a 1938 Condor Legion report on this use of this tactic:
We have had notable results in hitting the targets near the front, especially in bombing villages which hold enemy reserves and headquarters. We have had great success because these targets are easy to find and can be thoroughly destroyed by carpet bombing.

On the Spanish side, threats made prior to the raid by General Emilio Mola to &quot;end the war in the North of Spain quickly&quot; and threats apparently made against Republicans in Bilbao afterward implied a blunting of strategy and that air raids were effective and set to become an increasingly favorite instrument in the Nationalist war effort.

===Other theories===
Vidal outlines some other commonly voiced theories on the raid:
* The lack of reconnaissance missions before the bombing suggests to him that the Legion intended the destruction of the town rather than a specific target. Reconnaissance missions had been ordered as a prerequisite before raids around built-up areas on 6 January 1937. The intent of the order was to minimize civilian deaths and it had been issued by Mola, then Supreme Commander of the Air Force Salamanca.
* Since the raid appears to have ignored Mola&#x27;s earlier plans for reconnaissance prior to the raid, Vidal concludes that Richthofen must have received direct orders from Mola or Franco.
* According to Nicholas Rankin:
::It was von Richthofen himself who selected the mix of blast, splinter and fire bombs for this particular operation, agreed at a military conference in Burgos the night before. Von Richthofen wrote in his diary: &quot;As it was a complete success of our 250 kg (explosive) and ECB1 (incendiary) bombs&quot;.
* In Vidal&#x27;s view, such a mission would have typically used 10-kilogram bombs, and no incendiaries. Vidal also argues that the 22-ton load-out used in the raid represented a relatively large quantity for an attack on the stated primary objective. By way of comparison, Vidal indicates sources which give total tonnage of bombs dropped on the front during the first day of the offensive as sixty-six. Vidal goes on to claim that the official German account of this period in the war, &quot;The War in the North&quot;, states that only 7.956 tons of bombs were dropped on Guernica.
* Vidal argues that the Italians had been trying to obtain a separate peace agreement with the Basque nationalists and were not inclined to jeopardize those efforts by deliberately inflicting civilian casualties.

==Legacy==
The bombing gained immediate international media attention because of the alleged intentional targeting of civilians by aerial bombers, a strategy widely recognized as &quot;deviant&quot;, causing &quot;international horror&quot;.

Steer&#x27;s reports on the horrors of Guernica were greatly appreciated by the Basque people. Steer had made their plight known. Basque authorities later honored his memory by naming two streets in his memory and commissioning a bronze bust of him.

Despite Francoist efforts to play down the reports, they proliferated and led to widespread international outrage at the time. Reactions to and condemnation of the bombing of Guernica is regarded by some historians as a turning point in the construction of the modern concept of human rights.

===Picasso&#x27;s painting===
Guernica quickly became a world-renowned symbol of civilian suffering resulting from conflict and inspired Pablo Picasso to adapt one of his existing commissions into &quot;Guernica&quot;. The Spanish Republican Government had commissioned a work from him for the Spanish pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. Though he accepted the invitation to display a piece, he remained uninspired until he heard of the bombing of Guernica. Before the bombing of Guernica took place, Picasso never cared much for anything to do with politics. Once Picasso heard the news he changed his commissioned work for Spain into a reflection on the massacre.

Picasso began the painting on 11 May 1937, working on a piece of unbleached muslin (349 cm x 776 cm). Since the work was so large, Picasso had to use a ladder and a long-handled brush to reach the furthest corners of the canvas. He spent over two months creating &quot;Guernica&quot;. He used only black and white paint to invoke the truth-telling authority of documentary photography. &quot;The protest is found in what has happened to the bodies, the hands, the soles of the feet, the horse&#x27;s tongue, the mother&#x27;s breasts, the eyes in the head—the imaginative equivalent of what happened to them in the flesh. We are made to feel their pain with our own eyes.&quot;

The display of Picasso&#x27;s work at (Republican) Spain&#x27;s Pavilion during the 1937 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris reflected the effect on public consciousness. The painting, later adopted as a symbol of Basque nationalism during the Spanish transition to democracy, was displayed near &quot;Mercury Fountain&quot;, an overtly political work by Alexander Calder that incorporated mercury from the mines of Almadén. Today it resides in Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid. A tapestry copy of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot; is displayed on the wall of the United Nations building in New York City, at the entrance to the Security Council room. It was placed there as a reminder of the horrors of war.

===René Iché===

Immediately after the bombing French sculptor René Iché created &quot;Guernica&quot;, one of his most violent and personal sculptures. He was shocked and horrified by the enormous civilian massacre and worked endlessly on the plaster statue. Iché used his daughter to model a child&#x27;s body. During his lifetime, it was only exhibited once in 1940.

===German apology===
Recrimination for the activities of the Condor Legion and shame at the involvement of German citizens in the bombing of Guernica surfaced following German reunification in the 1990s. In 1997, the 60th anniversary of Operation Rügen, then German President Roman Herzog wrote to survivors apologizing on behalf of the German people and state for Germany&#x27;s role in the Civil War in general. Herzog said he wished to extend &quot;a hand of friendship and reconciliation&quot; on behalf of all German citizens. This sentiment was later ratified by members of the German Parliament who went on to legislate in 1998 for the removal of all former Legion members&#x27; names from associated German military bases.

===70th anniversary===
On the 70th anniversary of the bombing, the president of the Basque Parliament met with politicians, Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, and deputies from Hiroshima, Volgograd, Pforzheim, Dresden, Warsaw, and Oswiecim, as well as several survivors from Guernica itself. During the meeting they showed images and film clips of the bombing, took time to remember the 250 dead, and read the Guernica Manifesto for Peace, pleading that Guernica become a &quot;World Capital for Peace&quot;.

===2016 film===
The 2016 film &quot;Guernica&quot; leads to and culminates in the bombing of Guernica, set against the background of personalities involved in press coverage of the war.

===Comparison to other related bombings in the Spanish Civil War===
====Bombings of Jaén and Córdoba====
On 1 April 1937, at 17:20, the Spanish city of Jaén, one of the few areas in Andalusia under Republican control at that point of the Civil War, was bombed by 6 German bombers. The bombers made a single raid over the city, in which an estimated 150 people were killed. The order for the Jaén bombing was written and signed by General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, and is preserved in the Spanish National Archives.

On 1 April 1937, at noon, the Andalusian city of Córdoba, under rebel control at the time, had been heavily bombarded by seven bombers under the command of the Republican government. The civil population was warned about the bombing. The main target of the attack was the general military hospital in the city. It is estimated that 40 people were killed by the attack, about half of them in the hospital. The same day at 20:00, the Republican government signed an order to execute &quot;as many National prisoners as people died in the Jaén bombing.&quot; The order was carried through.

====Bombing of Durango====
The bombing of Durango is considered the clearest precedent for Guernica. It was perpetrated on 31 March 1937, by the Italian Air Forces in a three-raid pattern, almost identical to that carried out in Guernica. It killed an estimated 250 people and destroyed most of the city.

====Bombings of Madrid====
Alfredo Kindelán considers that both Guernica and Durango were &quot;practice drills&quot; in the development of more effective bombing strategies to use in bombings of Madrid. The city suffered a similar attack prior to the bombing of Guernica, and further attacks afterwards. Madrid presented a fierce resistance against the National troops that surpassed all of Franco&#x27;s expectations and forced him to completely modify his attack strategy. A series of air bombings to demoralize the population were ordered both before and after Guernica.

====Bombing of Cabra====

On 7 November 1938 Cabra was subject to Republican bombing. Three Tupolev SB-2 aircraft departing from the Fuente Alamo airfield (some 300 km away) and operated by Spanish crews performed a single raid; they dropped some 1.8 tons of explosives. There were over 400 casualties recorded, 109 killed and more than 300 other. Historians described the raid as “the most deadly of those carried out by the Republic in the course of the war”. The extremely high death-to-bombs ratio (60 dead per 1 ton of explosives) was the result of 250-kg bombs exploding on the central square, crowded during the usual morning food market.

====Bombing of Dresden====
On 13 February 2003, during the commemoration of the 58th anniversary of the Bombing of Dresden, inhabitants of Dresden, Germany, including survivors of the firestorm of 1945, joined with witnesses of the bombing of Guernica to issue an appeal to the people of the world:

&lt;poem&gt;
As our television sets show bombers preparing for war against Iraq, we survivors of Guernica and Dresden recall our own helplessness and horror when we were flung into the inferno of bombing—we saw people killed. Suffocated. Crushed. Incinerated. Mothers trying to protect their children with only their bodies. Old people with no strength left to flee from the flames. These pictures are still alive in our memory, and our accounts capture indelibly what we went through.

For decades we—and survivors from many other nations—have been scarred by the horror, loss and injuries we experienced in the wars of the 20th century. Today we see that the beginnings of the 21st century are also marked by suffering and destruction. On behalf of all the victims of war throughout the world we express our sympathy and solidarity with all those affected by the terror of 11 September in the US and the war in Afghanistan.

But is that very suffering now also to be inflicted upon the people of Iraq? Must thousands more die in a rain of bombs, must cities and villages be destroyed and cultural treasures obliterated?&lt;/poem&gt;

====Bombing of Hiroshima====
On 26 April 2007, Dr. Tadatoshi Akiba, mayor of Hiroshima and president of Mayors for Peace, compared the experience of Guernica to Hiroshima:

Human beings have often sought to give concrete form to our powerful collective longing for peace. After World War I, that longing led to the League of Nations and numerous rules and taboos designed to govern warfare itself. Of these, the most important was the proscription against attacking and killing civilian non-combatants even in times of war. However, the second half of the twentieth century has seen most of those taboos broken. Guernica was the point of departure, and Hiroshima is the ultimate symbol. We must find ways to communicate to future generations the history of horror that began with Guernica...&lt;br&gt;
In this sense, the leadership of those here in Guernica who seek peace and have worked hard to bring about this memorial ceremony is profoundly meaningful. The solidarity we feel today derives from our shared experience of the horror of war, and this solidarity can truly lead us toward a world beyond war.

<doc id="731925" wikidata="Q1016256" url="?curid=731925" title="Gilgandra, New South Wales">
<text>Gilgandra is a country town in the Orana region of New South Wales, Australia, and services the surrounding agricultural area where wheat is grown extensively together with other cereal crops, and sheep and beef cattle are raised. The town is the administrative seat of the Gilgandra Shire.

Sited at the junction of the Newell, Oxley and Castlereagh highways, Gilgandra is located in a wide bend of the Castlereagh River, downstream from its source near Coonabarabran, directly downstream from Mendooran, and upstream from Gulargambone and Coonamble. It is 432 km north-west of Sydney (about six hours&#x27; driving time), and is located approximately half way along the inland route from Melbourne to Brisbane. It is known as the town of windmills and the home of the &quot;Coo-ees&quot;, and is a gateway to the Warrumbungles National Park.

== Population ==


At the , the population of Gilgandra township was 2,600. In the wider Gilgandra area, the population was 4,300, with 96.4% Australian-born and 13.8% identifying as Aboriginal. The largest category of employment was Agriculture and Forestry, which involved 28.6% of the population.

== Castlereagh Waterhole ==
The name &quot;Gilgandra&quot; came from Aboriginal word for the area, and means &quot;long waterhole&quot;. The water level in the Castlereagh River is variable and the wide, sandy riverbed is frequently dry, or is reduced to a small stream. However, there was a large permanent waterhole in the river, long and deep, near where the township developed, and for many years subsequently. It was the source of the town&#x27;s name.

== Windmills and Artesian Water ==
Gilgandra is situated above the subterranean water of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) and, specifically, over the Surat Sub-basin of the GAB. Artesian water occurs where porous rocks below the surface, called aquifers, store and carry water underground. When bores are sunk to reach the aquifers, windmills can draw the water to the surface to be stored in tanks. Well over a hundred years ago, windmills were being used by townspeople to access Gilgandra&#x27;s fresh, drinkable artesian water for their households, and by farmers to obtain water for their stock. Windmills were being advertised in the first Gilgandra newspapers in 1905, with several local people selling and installing them, including plumber Bill Hitchen, later famous for organising the 1915 Cooee march. From the early 20th century, locals and others referred to Gilgandra as a &quot;town of windmills&quot;, and many references to that can be found.

In 1948, it was reported that there were over 300 windmills in Gilgandra. Many can still be seen dotted around the town but few are now in use. The Gilgandra Shire Council built a reticulated water supply in 1966, reducing reliance on private windmills. The council draws on artesian water, operating a network of nine bores to supply water to Gilgandra. In 2016 Gilgandra had the largest single annual licensed entitlement to water from the Great Artesian Basin of any shire council in NSW, at 2,020 megalitres.

== History ==
Before the European squatters took up pastoral runs in the 1830s, the Gilgandra region was home to three Aboriginal language groups: the Gamilaraay, Wiradjuri and Wayilwan. According to archaeological evidence cited in the Warrumbungle National Park guidebook, indigenous groups are believed to have lived to the east of Gilgandra for at least 25,000 years, and in the Warrumbungle Ranges, 70 kilometres to the north, for about 17,000 years.

Gilgandra was proclaimed as a town in 1888, and the first town blocks were sold in 1889. While that was an impetus to growth, the area had been settled by a Europeans for many years before that. Gilgandra&#x27;s Post Office was formally established in 1867, a local school had opened in 1881, and the first hearings were held in the Gilgandra court house in 1884. The Gilgandra Shire was constituted in 1906.

On 20 July 1900, an indigenous man, Jimmy Governor, murdered four members of the Mawbey family, and the children&#x27;s governess, at their farming property just east of Gilgandra, in the area of Breelong. He was working as a fencing contractor for Mr Mawbey. The story of the murders received great publicity at the time. It was revived 1972 as the basis of a fictional work by Thomas Keneally, &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot;.

During World War I, a recruitment march to Sydney began in Gilgandra, known as the Coo-ee March. The men who enlisted on the way became known locally as &quot;Coo-ees&quot;. The march was given its name because the marchers shouted the old bush call of &quot;cooee&quot; at each town along their journey to attract recruits. Twenty-six men left Gilgandra on 10 October 1915. At each town on the route, the marchers were feted and a recruitment meeting was held. By the time they reached Sydney, just over one month later on Friday 12 November 1915, the number of recruits had swelled to 263. They were welcomed on arrival in Sydney with huge crowds lining George Street near the Town Hall to welcome them and an official address given to them by the Minister for Works representing the Premier of New South Wales.

in 1919, as a peace thanksgiving, parishioners of St Ambrose Church in Bournemouth, England, grateful for the assistance England had received from the Dominions in defending the British Empire, decided to gift £1,200 to the town in the Empire with a good church and wartime service record. Gilgandra was chosen and the money funded the construction of St Ambrose Church, Gilgandra, which commenced in 1920.

== Climate ==
Gilgandra experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa,&quot; Trewartha: &quot;Cfak&quot;), with hot summers and cool winters.
== Heritage listings ==
Gilgandra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Myrtle Street: St Ambrose Church

Gilgandra has many sporting facilities. Local clubs support participation and arrange training and competitions. 

The most popular sport in Gilgandra is rugby league. The Gilgandra Panthers rugby league team play in the Castlereagh Cup and have won the competition on six occasions, with the most recent being in 2018. They also won five premierships in the Group 14 competition which ran from 1949 until 2000, and won a Group 11 title in 1989 during their short stint in that competition.

Gilgandra&#x27;s public swimming pool is located next to the town&#x27;s main park and is open across the warmer months from October to end March. Learn-to-swim and exercise classes are held here. Set in lovely grassed grounds, the tiled pool was opened in October 1939 and is 33m long. There is also a children&#x27;s play pool with good sun protection over. Grassed tennis courts are located on a corner opposite the swimming pool (corner Castlereagh and Willie Sts).

A 9-hole public golf course, with grass greens and a licensed club-house, is located on Racecourse Rd over the bridge from the main part of the town. Golf competitions are held regularly. The golf course is situated entirely within the town&#x27;s horse racing track.

The town has a race course for horse racing, situated on Racecourse Road, where the Gilgandra Jockey Club arranges race meetings during the year, including the Gilgandra Cup held each January. The race course is picturesque with the town&#x27;s golf fairways and greens inside the boundary of the track.

There is a youth club, which has squash courts, basketball courts, and an indoor area. A fitness centre operates out of the facility.

There are two main grassed recreation grounds where many different team and club sports are played (cricket, rugby league, football, Little Athletics). The town&#x27;s original oval is located in Eiraben St and the Ernie Knight Oval is on Warren Rd.

Gilgandra Speedway is a popular track in the district where regular motor (car) racing events are held in many divisions. It is run by Gilgandra District Speedway Club which has hosted both state and national titles here at different times. The track is well fenced and is lit for night racing. It is located on the Newell Highway 4 km south of the township (direction of Dubbo).

=== Tourist Attractions ===
The tourist information centre is located in the Cooee Heritage and Visitor Information Centre, at the south end of the town, on the Newell Highway. Coming from the direction of Dubbo, it is on the right-hand-side just after the grain silos and railway track crossing. Coming from Coonabarabran, Coonamble or Mendooran directions, it is along the river bank on the left-hand-side.

The Cooee Heritage and Visitor Information Centre houses several museums and galleries. The Gilgandra Art Gallery exhibits local and visiting artists in a range of mediums, and exhibitions are regularly changed. Aboriginal artefacts and ancient fossils and shells are displayed in the Joy Trudgett Gallery. Family history, including details of Gilgandra locals who enlisted in WW2, is on display in the Allan Wise Gallery where exhibitions are also regularly changed.

The Gilgandra Rural Museum displays and preserves an extensive collection of local farming equipment, and agricultural plant and machinery. It was established, and is run, by the volunteers of the &quot;Gilgandra Historical Society&quot;. The Museum is situated just along from the Cooee Heritage and Visitor Information Centre on the Newell Highway at the edge of Gilgandra and can be identified by a large display windmill outside. Particularly interesting large items include the Howard Rotary Hoe (a version of a cultivator) which was invented at Gilgandra, a Ridley Stripper, and a Ruston &amp; Proctor Steam Traction Engine.

Windmill Walk commences at the Rural Museum and meanders along the Castlereagh River to the town centre. Picnic spots and BBQ facilities are located along the way.

The Gilgandra Native Flora Reserve is 8.5 ha of remnant bushland which features many plant species. The local wildflowers in the reserve are best seen from September to November. There are picnic and barbecue facilities.

Gilgandra has a privately owned observatory open to the public from Wednesday to Sunday.

Hitchen House Museum is set up in the house once owned and lived in by Bill Hitchen, who was the driving force for the Cooee March. Displays in the museum tell the story of the Cooee March. There is a good array of WWI memorabilia in the museum.

The Cooee March memorial is a stone cairn marking the spot in Bridge Street where local men commenced the Cooee March on 10 October 1915. A nearby wall mural contributes to the memorial. Recruitment marches like this were called Snowball marches, and sprang up elsewhere in NSW following the example of the Cooee March. The men assembled here in October 1915 to begin their recruitment drive by themselves marching to Sydney.

There is a community radio station WARFM, which is on 98.9FM, broadcasting a wide range of programs.

* William Thomas Hitchen (1864–1916), was a Gilgandra plumber and the Captain of the Gilgandra rifle club when WW1 commenced. He proposed the concept of a recruiting march from Gilgandra to Sydney, and was instrumental in making this a reality by organising the Cooee March which commenced in October 1915 from Gilgandra. Hitchen himself enlisted for the march and was shipped with troops to England. However, he died in England in 1916, not having seen active service.

<text>Dollard-des-Ormeaux (; commonly referred to as D.D.O. or simply Dollard) is a city and a predominantly English-speaking suburb of Montreal in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is located on the Island of Montreal. The town was named after French martyr Adam Dollard des Ormeaux.

The town was merged with the city of Montreal in 2002, and became part of the borough of Dollard-Des Ormeaux–Roxboro. When residents were later offered the option, they chose to leave the city of Montreal, and the town was reinstated as a separate entity in 2006.

==Name==
The orthography of the city&#x27;s name has been adjusted periodically. Originally written as Dollard-des-Ormeaux, it became Dollard des Ormeaux (no hyphens) in 1960, and reverted again to the hyphenated spelling in 1969.

In 2001, the official Commission de toponymie du Québec ruled that the correct orthography of the city&#x27;s name is Dollard-Des Ormeaux (one hyphen, one space, all title caps) due to the patronymic particle. However, this was not widely accepted, and is rarely used in practice. In particular, , the city&#x27;s own website did not use this way of writing the city&#x27;s name. In 2022, the Commission officially reverted to the spelling Dollard-des-Ormeaux, which had been in use since 1924.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In 1714, the area was part of the Parish of St-Joachim de Pointe-Claire. It became part of the Parish of Ste-Geneviève when it detached from Pointe-Claire in 1845.

On July 29, 1924, Dollard-des-Ormeaux detached from the Parish of Ste-Geneviève and became a separate municipality in response to a tax imposed by the Parish road improvements on Gouin Boulevard. Its first mayor was Hormidas Meloche.

The town&#x27;s name honours the French martyr Adam Dollard des Ormeaux, who was killed by the Iroquois at Long Sault in 1660.

=== Later history ===
The City of Dollard-des-Ormeaux obtained a new charter and was incorporated as a city on February 4, 1960.

Dollard-des-Ormeaux was originally a bedroom community in the early 1960s. The population was barely a few hundred in 1960, and within 10 years, exceeded 15,000.

One of its original main axes, Anselme-Lavigne Street in the Westpark neighbourhood, is named for a farmer who sold his land to the Belcourt Construction Company. Many of the streets in the Sunnydale neighbourhood, including &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Hyman&quot;, are named for members in the prominent Zunenshine family who owned Belcourt. The community is a mixture of residential and commercial properties. Des Sources and St-Jean Boulevards are its main commercial arteries, and are represented by the two vertical lines in the city&#x27;s official logo. The three circles in the logo, from left to right, respectively represent the St-Jean Sector, the Westpark Sector and the Sunnybrooke Sector. The three circles and two vertical lines in the logo represent the city&#x27;s geography and artfully spell out &quot;ddo&quot;.

The Town Hall was located in a house on Des Sources Boulevard in the early 1960s, and was moved to an 1806 French-Canadian farmhouse in 1964.

When Canada&#x27;s centennial anniversary was due to occur, the town decided to create a &quot;Centennial Park,&quot; featuring a man-made lake and hills. It was suggested to use this project for a reservoir for stormwater drainage, as the city was faced with the need to expand surface drainage pipes. The project was announced September 8, 1966. However the project ran into problems and became a local scandal and a major drain on resources. It was finally completed in the 1970s, albeit overdue and overbudget.

Dollard-des-Ormeaux was included in the Montreal Urban Community when that government was created in 1970.

=== Recent years ===

On January 1, 2002, as part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, it merged with the city of Montreal and became part of the Dollard-Des Ormeaux–Roxboro borough. After a change of government and a 2004 demerger referendum, Dollard-des-Ormeaux was reconstituted as an independent city on January 1, 2006. It is now the Montreal Island&#x27;s most populous city outside Montreal.

Albeit not served by the Montreal Metro, the city will be served by the Réseau express métropolitain light rail system with a station at the juncture of Highway 40 and Des Sources Boulevard.

== Demographics ==
According to the Office québécois de la langue française, Dollard-des-Ormeaux has been officially recognized as a bilingual municipality since 2 Nov 2005.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Dollard-Des Ormeaux had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.



==Parks and facilities==

Dollard is known for its many well-attended green spaces, providing a park within one kilometre of each home. Notable parks include Centennial Park, Westminster Park, Frederick Wilson (Fredmir) Park, Edward Janiszewski Park (Baffin Park), and Terry Fox Park. Edward Janiszewski Park was named after the longest-reigning mayor of the city.

Dollard-des-Ormeaux is home to the Dollard Civic Centre, which serves as city hall, the public library, and houses ice skating and swimming facilities.

==Sports==

Dollard is home to many juvenile sports teams, including hockey, soccer, baseball, swimming, and ringette. In 2013, the city received $20 000 from Kraft Le Hockey Continue program in recognition of the efforts of Lance Taylor Townend, an administrator and coach with the Dollard Hockey Association.

Since the city&#x27;s incorporation in 1960, there have been seven mayors. They are Alfred Labrosse (1960–1963), Frederick T. Wilson (1963–1968), Gerald Dephoure (1968–1978), Jean Cournoyer (1978–1982), Gerry Weiner (1982–1984), Edward Janiszewski (1984–2017) and Alex Bottausci (2017–present).

Edward Janiszewski&#x27;s 33 years as Mayor of DDO makes him the longest-serving Mayor in the city&#x27;s history, and the second longest-serving Mayor in the history of Canada, behind Hazel McCallion. He was first elected to the city council in 1978 before becoming mayor in 1984. During his tenure, he also oversaw the construction of Dollard-des-Ormeaux&#x27;s famous library and many of the additions which were made to the civic centre. At the time of his defeat in 2017, the city was left with a surplus of $15 million.

=== Municipal Patrol ===

Established in 1980, a municipal patrol service was initially created to enhance public safety in the city and to enforce parking violations after the merger of police departments on the Island of Montreal. The service is responsible for public safety, municipal by-law enforcement, crime prevention, emergency measures, and community relations.

<doc id="731943" wikidata="Q2874904" url="?curid=731943" title="Aylmer, Quebec">
<text>Aylmer is a former city in Quebec, Canada. It is located on the north shore of the Ottawa River and along Route 148. In January 2002, it amalgamated into the city of Gatineau, which is part of Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region. Aylmer&#x27;s population in 2011 was 55,113.
It is named after Lord Aylmer, who was a governor general of British North America and a lieutenant governor of Lower Canada from 1830 to 1835.

It bills itself as the &quot;Recreation Capital of the National Capital&quot;, given its many golf courses, green spaces, spas, marina, and bicycle paths. There is little industry in the sector, the area being mainly residential. Virtually all the major shops, services, and restaurants are located along Chemin d&#x27;Aylmer. The sector&#x27;s indoor swimming pool and skateboard park are also located on that road.

The population of the Hull-Aylmer Federal electoral district, which combines the communities of Hull and Aylmer, was 105,419 in 2016. The 2016 census of Hull-Aylmer showed that the population was about 67% francophone, 18% anglophone, and 15% native speakers of other languages. Much of its workforce commutes across the river to Ottawa.

==History==

Prior to its foundation, parts of Aylmer, like most surrounding areas of the Ottawa region, were often occupied as summer camps by the Algonquin First Nations population. The first European explorers known to reach the actual location of Aylmer were Nicolas-du-Vigneau and Samuel de Champlain during the early 17th century in their explorations west of Quebec City. It was only during the early 19th century that colonization began in the region; during the same period the foundations of the communities of Hull and Bytown were being established.

In 1800, the order of the day was to settle the land by granting the responsibility to groups of &quot;leaders and associates&quot; led and funded by an individual who would be granted large tracts of land for his efforts to create a settlement. Almost 40,000 acres of land in the Township of Hull were granted to Philemon Wright, an American ex-pat from Woburn, Massachusetts who was the pioneer and founder of the first permanent settlement of the Ottawa Valley. Many settlers arrived in the first years and as associates, were granted large 100 and 200 acre lots to farm just west of the new settlement, and a road soon stretched from Wright&#x27;s Town, first to the Deschênes Landing by 1802, then in 1805 it was extended west to the &quot;Chaudière Lake Landing&quot; (now called Lake Deschênes). The road was improved and widened in 1818 and, with the addition of two toll booths, it became known as the &quot;Britannia Turnpike&quot;. The village at its western extremity was known as Chaudière Lake Village, then more widely called Turnpike End.

In that same year of 1818, Philemon&#x27;s oldest son, Philemon Junior, founded the village when he cleared 30 acres of the &quot;Chaudière Lake Farm&quot; (a supply farm for the timber industry) at Turnpike End, improved the &quot;Chaudière Lake Landing&quot;, and built the &quot;Wright Hotel&quot;, a tavern and two stores, laying down the infrastructure of the village. The landing at Turnpike End had become a busy stopping-off point so the hotel, tavern, and stores were built to accommodate all the travelers who journeyed to and from the Upper Ottawa River.

In November 1821, Philemon Junior died suddenly in a tragic coach accident. As a result, Philemon Sr. needed a new manager for the &quot;Chaudière Lake Farm&quot;. His other sons were busy managing the family&#x27;s timber business, so Philemon Sr. chose his nephew, Charles Symmes, to be the new manager. Charles, 23 years-old at the time, had been in his uncle&#x27;s employ for two years. The hotel was made ready for his occupancy in 1822. In October 1823, the arrangement was made official and more equitable with Charles named manager of the Farm and the &quot;Wright Hotel&quot; with &quot;P. Wright &amp; Sons&quot; in a lease agreement. Charles would manage the farm and the hotel until a dispute arose between Charles and his uncle Philemon regarding the terms of their agreement. Charles tore up the contract and refused to repay his uncle the money that he owed him. The issue was settled in court, in the favour of Philemon Sr. Despite the court ruling, correspondence between uncle and nephew remained cordial for years.

Charles left &quot;P. Wright &amp; Sons&quot; to pursue business on his own at Turnpike End, and had acquired a 200-acre lot and, so in 1830 he had his property surveyed and divided up into village lots for sale and to create a &quot;government village&quot; for a post office and jail, as per the Crown&#x27;s directive. He also bought some of Harvey Parker&#x27;s waterfront lot to build a new wharf. He then joined the &quot;Union Forwarding Company&quot;, founded by John Egan, Ruggles Wright and Joseph Aumond, a company that ran the steamboat &quot;Lady Colborne&quot;, the first to operate in that area.

In 1831, he built a large stone building that he named the &quot;Aylmer Hotel&quot;, which soon after became known as the &quot;Symmes Inn&quot; (aka l&#x27;Auberge Symmes). With all of the improvements at the landing, locals would begin calling it the &quot;Symmes Landing&quot;.

The post office and county registration office in Aylmer were opened in 1831; it was named after the Governor-General Lord Aylmer. The village was first incorporated in 1847 and served as administrative centre for the region until 1897. A courthouse and jail that served the Outaouais region were built in 1852. With the important shipbuilding yards on the banks of the Ottawa and its significant growth as one of the region&#x27;s economic powerhouses of that time,

The Aylmer Boating Club was founded in 1890. The club was renamed the Aylmer Yacht Club in 1900. In 1901, Moses Chamberlain Edey designed the clubhouse. By 1906, the club was renamed the Victoria Yacht Club. In 1921, the Club burned down and was not rebuilt.

During most of the 19th century, the town of Aylmer, like much of the Outaouais, was an important centre for the wood industry. During that period several steam boats were built alongside the Deschênes Rapids and the Ottawa River across from Britannia. Railroad construction began during the early Canadian Confederation years. Meanwhile, the economy of Aylmer was more focused on the wood and wood pulp industries and much later, on tourism. In 1921, a destructive fire ravaged large sections of the village destroying dozens of homes and businesses. During the Great Depression Aylmer&#x27;s biggest sawmill closed its doors.

Aylmer would regain importance during the second half of the 20th century when, due to urban sprawling from the Ottawa and Gatineau areas, it became an important suburb to the region. In 1975 the villages of Lucerne and Deschênes, located just east of downtown Aylmer, were amalgamated. Several new residential developments were created on the northern and eastern side of old Aylmer. Numerous businesses and shopping malls were built along the Main Street including les Galeries Aylmer and the Glenwood Plaza, the latter being destroyed by a fire in 2005 and rebuilt. In addition, several golf courses, a Sheraton hotel, and a movie theatre were added through the city. On August 4, 1994, a destructive tornado tore through the city damaging nearly 400 to 500 homes (including a dozen homes that were completely destroyed) and injuring at least 15 people. Damage figures were estimated at $15 million. Rated F3 on the Fujita scale, the tornado tracked for 8 kilometers and was one of the most intense tornadoes in history across the National Capital Region. Aylmer also saw many power outages and very dangerous driving conditions throughout the North American ice storm of 1998, which left more than 4 million people without electricity, most of them in southern Quebec, western New Brunswick and Eastern Ontario, some of them for an entire month. The Canadian Forces were called in to assist with the relief efforts.

Before the amalgamation of the Urban Community Region of the Outaouais, Aylmer had a population exceeding 40,000 with additional growth after 2002 stemming from development in several areas of the sector, including the expansion of the Plateau de la Capitale neighbourhood which started in the former city of Hull in the early 1990s.

In recent years, efforts have been made to create the Boucher Forest protected area, in light of increasing suburban sprawl and housing development. The group that strives for protection of the Boucher Forest is the &quot;Fondation Forêt Boucher&quot;, the Boucher Forest Foundation. The forest is a reservoir of biodiversity in the region; at-risk and endangered species such as &quot;Panax quinquefolium&quot; (American ginseng), and &quot;Juglans cinerea&quot; (butternut) exist in this threatened ecosystem. The forest is bound by Highway 148 to the south, Chemin Vanier to the east, the &quot;Jardins Lavigne&quot; neighbourhood to the west (one of Aylmer&#x27;s newer suburban areas), and Chemin Pink to the north. Furthermore, an old mining quarry is directly adjacent to the forest&#x27;s northwest corner.

==Transportation==
=== Roads and recreational pathways ===
Aylmer is served by provincial Route 148, known as the boulevard des Allumettières within the city of Gatineau, which extends from the Ontario border near Pembroke, to Montreal, about two hours away.
Other main roads include the Chemin d&#x27;Aylmer/rue Principale and Lucerne Blvd (running east and west)., Vanier, Eardley, Broad/Klock, Wilfrid-Lavigne, Mountain Rd., Pink Rd.
Aylmer is connected to Tunney&#x27;s Pasture and Westboro in Ottawa by the Champlain Bridge, at the southeast corner.

It has been proposed to build an extension from Autoroute 50 in Gatineau that would come though Chelsea and central Aylmer to connect to a new bridge between Deschênes and Britannia in the city of Ottawa, but it remains no more than a plan, mainly due to strong local opposition from Britannia residents.

Aylmer is home to an effective and generally well-maintained network of bicycle paths that encircle the central portion of the area and run past many scenic locations, such as the Aylmer Marina and the Deschênes Rapids. The bike path system is maintained by the National Capital Commission.

=== Public transit ===
Public transit is provided by the Société de transport de l&#x27;Outaouais, or STO for short, which runs twelve bus lines through the region (although many only operate during rush hour). The STO has been criticized by Aylmer residents—particularly youth—for not providing enough service to the area, and for not providing enough inter-sector bus lines (the western terminus for most Aylmer lines is in the Rideau Centre in downtown Ottawa). The STO is planning a bus rapid transit system known as Rapibus that would connect the Hull and Gatineau sectors, with the possibility of an expansion to Aylmer.

The railroad bedding still exists from Aylmer&#x27;s now-defunct rail line, and pressure has been put on the STO to set up a light rail system in Gatineau that could connect to Ottawa&#x27;s O-Train network via the Prince of Wales Bridge. If this were to happen, Aylmer could theoretically be served by light rail as well, but at present this appears highly unlikely.

==Politics==
=== Federal ===
In terms of population, Aylmer makes up about one third of the riding of Hull—Aylmer, which had elected a Liberal member of parliament in every federal election since its conception in 1984 — its predecessors, the ridings of Hull and Wright, in place from 1892 to 1984, also only ever elected Liberals. This, however, changed when the riding elected NDP MP Nycole Turmel to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2011 federal election. The Liberals returned to power in the riding with the election of Greg Fergus, Member of Parliament and the Right. Honourable Justin Trudeau.

=== Municipal ===
In the 2005 Gatineau municipal election, Aylmer voters showed particularly strong support for current mayor Marc Bureau, over incumbent and former mayor of &quot;old&quot; Hull Yves Ducharme. Similar voting patterns appeared in the sectors of Buckingham and Masson-Angers, the other two &quot;outlying&quot; regions of Gatineau. This could be due to a perception among residents that the Ducharme administration was more focused on the urban core of the new city, as opposed to the periphery, as well as the rapid development of green-spaces into residential subdivisions. However, six months after the November election, residents are showing the highest level of dissatisfaction with the Bureau administration out of all the sectors, citing Aylmer&#x27;s being left out of municipal processes, poor quality of municipal services, and little to no action to halt suburban sprawl. Masson-Angers and Buckingham residents are presently showing the most support for the new government.

Recently, the City of Gatineau administration had plans to reuse a former landfill site on Cook Road in the north end of the sector to build a new composting plant. A deal was planned with a non-profit organisation called La Ressourcerie to operate the site. However, local residents are strongly opposed with health and environmental concerns especially due to the past of the landfill site. Despite displaying their fierce opposition, which included acts of intimidation and threats towards some councillors, at a Gatineau City Council Meeting, Mayor Marc Bureau mentioned that he will still build the plant at the Cook site, and that according to him it was the best possible site. He later added that he will study other possibilities for the plant.

Aylmer&#x27;s three wards are presently represented on the Gatineau city council by Gilles Chagnon, Mike Duggan and Audrey Bureau

==== Amalgamation and de-amalgamation ====

In 2002, the City of Aylmer became a part of Gatineau when the then-Parti Québécois government forcibly merged several clusters of cities and metropolitan areas throughout Québec. Residents of Aylmer were particularly against the amalgamation, citing fears of reduced municipal services, more suburban development, and a loss of cultural identity, as well as geographic differences (Hull and Gatineau arguably constitute a region of conurbation, whereas Aylmer was at the time separated by an expanse of sparsely inhabited green space).

A movement was started to halt the &quot;forced fusion&quot; of five cities surrounding Gatineau. The movement had particularly strong support in Aylmer. Signs reading &quot;Je me souviendrai des fusions forcées&quot; (literally, &quot;I will remember forced fusions,&quot; a play on Quebec&#x27;s motto &quot;Je me souviens&quot;) were a common sight.
When the Quebec Liberal Party won the 2003 provincial election, the newly amalgamated former cities were given the opportunity to demerge. A referendum was held to decide the fate of the City of Gatineau which required a double vote: at least 35% of eligible voters from a given sector had to cast ballots, and more than 50% of these had to be in favour of de-amalgamation. Aylmer voters chose to separate from Gatineau but not enough ballots were cast, meaning Aylmer remained a sector of the larger city.

The voting outcome itself was done in such a way that even if Aylmer succeeded in de-amalgamating from Gatineau, they would only do so in name. The de-amalgamation claimed that once Aylmer was its own area once again, it would have to pay for all its own changes, while Gatineau would still be in control of the administration. This meant that the sector of Aylmer would receive no support from the administration that determined what was built where, but would still have to contribute 100% to the costs of the changes voted by the city of Gatineau.

Prior to the merger, Aylmer&#x27;s residents and municipal laws had strongly opposed extensive construction programs. Following the amalgamation, many of the sector&#x27;s prized green spaces were cut down for residential construction. Ex-Aylmer neighbourhoods like Wychwood and Village Lucerne have seen their undeveloped spaces sold to contractors.

*Vieux-Verger: A francophone primary school, located on Wilfrid-Lavigne boulevard. It teaches school from kindergarten to grade 6. Before the school was built, an orchard was present on that lot, which inspired the name for the school, which is French for &quot;Old Orchard&quot;.
*Euclide-Lanthier: A francophone primary school, located on Elizabeth street. It teaches kindergarten to grade 6.
*Trois-Portages: A francophone primary school, located on Broad street, in the lot next to École secondaire Grande-Rivière. It teaches kindergarten to grade 6.
*École du Village: A francophone primary school divided into two separate buildings: Limoges and St-Paul. It teaches kindergarten through 6. Limoges (kindergarten to grade 3) is located on Symmes. St-Paul (grades 4 to 6) is located on Dalhousie.
*Lord Aylmer School : Renamed after the amalgamation of Saint Mark&#x27;s Elementary and Aylmer Elementary. The school has two campuses (located only across the street from each other). The former St. Mark&#x27;s (known as the &quot;Junior Campus&quot;) teaches students from kindergarten to grade 3. Aylmer Elementary (the &quot;Senior Campus&quot;) teaches grades 4 to 6. Lord Aylmer Elementary has a program in English and French immersion. Located on Frank Robinson street.(Historical note: Aylmer Elementary was previously Aylmer High School, an English-language secondary school which was de-commissioned with the opening of the Philemon Wright High School in Hull in 1969.)
*École de la Forêt: A francophone primary school, located on Avenue du Bois-Franc. It teaches kindergarten to grade 6.
*École des Tournesols: A francophone primary school, located on Rue de la Fabrique. It teaches kindergarten to grade 6.
*Montessori de l&#x27;Outaouais: Based on the Montessori theory of education, this French preschool and kindergarten is thirty years old. It is located at 161 Principale Street.

===Secondary schools===

École secondaire Grande-Rivière: a francophone high school, located on Broad street, this school teaches well over 2000 students, and supports an additional 100+ staff members, including teachers, administrators, janitors, and other service personnel. It is the largest secondary school in the sector. It sports a standard programme, a musical concentration programme, an artistic concentration programme, an IB Middle Years Programme, the International Programme (P.E.I), and several support programmes for students in difficult situations. It also has a small community of highly active students who participate in the organization of school activities.

Other secondary schools are Symmes Junior High School (grades 7 and 8) and the recently constructed École secondaire D&#x27;Arcy McGee High School (grades 9, 10 and 11), both located on Blvd. du Plateau, this is because they are joined, making the school grades 7–11.

<doc id="731948" wikidata="Q2840725" url="?curid=731948" title="Plan position indicator">
<text>A plan position indicator (PPI) is a type of radar display that represents the radar antenna in the center of the display, with the distance from it and height above ground drawn as concentric circles. As the radar antenna rotates, a radial trace on the PPI sweeps in unison with it about the center point. It is the most common type of radar display.

== Description ==
The radar antenna sends pulses while rotating 360 degrees around the radar site at a fixed elevation angle. It can then change angle or repeat at the same angle according to the need. Return echoes from targets are received by the antenna and processed by the receiver and the most direct display of those data is the PPI.

The height of the echoes increases with the distance to the radar, as represented in the adjacent image. This change is not a straight line but a curve as the surface of the Earth is curved and &quot;sinks&quot; below the radar horizon. For fixed-site installations, north is usually represented at the top of the image. For moving installations, such as small ship and aircraft radars, the top may represent the bow or nose of the ship or aircraft, &quot;i.e.&quot;, its heading (direction of travel) and this is usually represented by a lubber line. Some systems may incorporate the input from a gyrocompass to rotate the display and once again display north as &quot;up&quot;.

Also, the signal represented is the reflectivity at only one elevation of the antenna, so it is possible to have many PPIs at one time, one for each antenna elevation.

== History ==
The PPI display was first used prior to the start of the Second World War in a Jagdschloss experimental radar system outside Berlin. The first production PPI was devised at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, UK and was first introduced in the H2S radar blind-bombing system of World War II.

Originally, data was displayed in real time on a cathode-ray tube (CRT), and thus the only way to store the information received was by taking a photograph of the screen.

Philo Taylor Farnsworth, the American inventor of all-electronic television in September 1927, contributed to this in an important way. Farnsworth refined a version of his picture tube (CRT) and called it an &quot;Iatron;&quot; generically known as a storage tube. It could store an image for milliseconds to minutes and even hours. One version that kept an image alive about a second before fading proved to be useful for radar. This slow-to-fade display tube was used by air traffic controllers from the very beginning of radar usage.
With the development of more sophisticated radar systems, it became possible to digitize data and store it in memory, allowing access at a later date.

== Uses ==

The PPI is used in many domains involving display of range and positioning, especially in radars, including air traffic control, ship navigation, meteorology, on board ships and aircraft etc. PPI displays are also used to display sonar data, especially in underwater warfare.
However, because the speed of sound in water is very slow compared to microwaves in air, a sonar PPI has an expanding circle that starts with each transmitted &quot;ping&quot; of sound. In meteorology, a competing display system is the CAPPI (Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicator) when a multi-angle scan is available.

Using computers to process data, modern sonar and lidar installations can mimic radar PPI displays too.

<text>In geometry, a Heronian triangle (or Heron triangle) is a triangle whose side lengths , , and and area are all positive integers. Heronian triangles are named after Heron of Alexandria, based on their relation to Heron&#x27;s formula which Heron demonstrated with the example triangle of sides and area .

Heron&#x27;s formula implies that the Heronian triangles are exactly the positive integer solutions of the Diophantine equation
:formula_1 
that is, the side lengths and area of any Heronian triangle satisfy the equation, and any positive integer solution of the equation describes a Heronian triangle.

If the three side lengths are setwise coprime (meaning that the greatest common divisor of all three sides is 1), the Heronian triangle is called &quot;primitive&quot;.

Triangles whose side lengths and areas are all rational numbers (positive rational solutions of the above equation) are sometimes also called &quot;Heronian triangles&quot; or &quot;rational triangles&quot;; in this article, these more general triangles will be called &quot;rational Heronian triangles&quot;. Every (integral) Heronian triangle is a rational Heronian triangle. Conversely, every rational Heronian triangle is geometrically similar to exactly one primitive Heronian triangle.

In any rational Heronian triangle, the three altitudes, the circumradius, the inradius and exradii, and the sines and cosines of the three angles are also all rational numbers.

==Scaling to primitive triangles==
Scaling a triangle with a factor of consists of multiplying its side lengths by ; this multiplies the area by formula_2 and produces a similar triangle. Scaling a rational Heronian triangle by a rational factor produces another rational Heronian triangle.

Given a rational Heronian triangle of side lengths formula_3 the scale factor formula_4 produces a rational Heronian triangle such that its side lengths formula_5 are setwise coprime integers. It is proved below that the area is an integer, and thus the triangle is a Heronian triangle. Such a triangle is often called a &quot;primitive Heronian triangle.&quot;

In summary, every similarity class of rational Heronian triangles contains exactly one primitive Heronian triangle. A byproduct of the proof is that exactly one of the side lengths of a primitive Heronian triangle is an even integer.

&quot;Proof:&quot; One has to prove that, if the side lengths formula_5 of a rational Heronian triangle are coprime integers, then the area is also an integer and exactly one of the side lengths is even.

The Diophantine equation given in the introduction shows immediately that formula_7 is an integer. Its square root formula_8 is also an integer, since the square root of an integer is either an integer or an irrational number.

If exactly one of the side lengths is even, all the factors in the right-hand side of the equation are even, and, by dividing the equation by , one gets that formula_9 and formula_10 are integers.

As the side lengths are supposed to be coprime, one is left with the case where one or three side lengths are odd. Supposing that is odd, the right-hand side of the Diophantine equation can be rewritten
:formula_11
with formula_12 and formula_13 even. As the square of an odd integer is congruent to formula_14 modulo , the right-hand side of the equation must be congruent to formula_15 modulo . It is thus impossible, that one has a solution of the Diophantine equation, since formula_7 must be the square of an integer, and the square of an integer is congruent to or modulo .

==Examples==
Any Pythagorean triangle is a Heronian triangle. The side lengths of such a triangle are integers, by definition. In any such triangle, one of the two shorter sides has even length, so the area (the product of these two sides, divided by two) is also an integer.
Examples of Heronian triangles that are not right-angled are the isosceles triangle obtained by joining a Pythagorean triangle and its mirror image along a side of the right angle. Starting with the Pythagorean triple this gives two Heronian triangles with side lengths and and area .

More generally, given two Pythagorean triples formula_17 and formula_18 with largest entries and , one can join the corresponding triangles along the sides of length (see the figure) for getting a Heronian triangle with side lengths formula_19 and area formula_20 (this is an integer, since the area of a Pythagorean triangle is an integer).

There are Heronian triangles that cannot be obtained by joining Pythagorean triangles. For example, the Heronian triangle of side lengths formula_21 and area 72, since none of its altitudes is an integer. Such Heronian triangles are known as . However, every Heronian triangle can be constructed from right triangles with rational side lengths, and is thus similar to a decomposable Heronian triangle. In fact, at least one of the altitudes of a triangle is inside the triangle, and divides it into two right triangles. These triangles have rational sides, since the cosine and the sine of the angles of a Heronian triangle are rational numbers, and, with notation of the figure, one has formula_22 and formula_23 where formula_24 is the left-most angle of the triangle.

==Rationality properties==

Many quantities related to a Heronian triangle are rational numbers. In particular:

*All the altitudes of a Heronian triangle are rational. This can be seen from the fact that the area of a triangle is half of one side times its altitude from that side, and a Heronian triangle has integer sides and area. Some Heronian triangles have three non-integer altitudes, for example the acute (15, 34, 35) with area 252 and the obtuse (5, 29, 30) with area 72. Any Heronian triangle with one or more non-integer altitudes can be scaled up by a factor equalling the least common multiple of the altitudes&#x27; denominators in order to obtain a similar Heronian triangle with three integer altitudes.
*All the interior perpendicular bisectors of a Heronian triangle are rational: For any triangle these are given by formula_25 formula_26 and formula_27 where the sides are and the area is ; in a Heronian triangle all of , , , and are integers.
*Every interior angle of a Heronian triangle has a rational sine. This follows from the area formula , in which the area and the sides and are integers, and equivalently for the other interior angles.
*Every interior angle of a Heronian triangle has a rational cosine. This follows from the law of cosines, , in which the sides , , and are integers, and equivalently for the other interior angles.
*Because all Heronian triangles have all interior angles&#x27; sines and cosines rational, this implies that the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant of each interior angle is either rational or infinite.
*Half of each interior angle has a rational tangent because , and equivalently for other interior angles. Knowledge of (at least two of) these half-angle tangent values is sufficient to reconstruct the side lengths of a primitive Heronian triangle (see below).
*For any triangle, the angle spanned by a side as viewed from the center of the circumcircle is twice the interior angle of the triangle vertex opposite the side. Because the half-angle tangent for each interior angle of a Heronian triangle is rational, it follows that the quarter-angle tangent of each such central angle of a Heronian triangle is rational. (Also, the quarter-angle tangents are rational for the central angles of a Brahmagupta quadrilateral, but is an unsolved problem whether this is true for all Robbins pentagons.) The reverse is true for all cyclic polygons generally; if all such central angles have rational tangents for their quarter angles then the cyclic polygon can be scaled to simultaneously have integer area, sides, and diagonals (connecting any two vertices).
*There are no Heronian triangles whose three internal angles form an arithmetic progression. This is because all plane triangles with interior angles in an arithmetic progression must have one interior angle of 60°, which does not have a rational sine.
*Any square inscribed in a Heronian triangle has rational sides: For a general triangle the inscribed square on side of length has length formula_28 where is the triangle&#x27;s area; in a Heronian triangle, both and are integers.
*Every Heronian triangle has a rational inradius (radius of its inscribed circle): For a general triangle the inradius is the ratio of the area to half the perimeter, and both of these are rational in a Heronian triangle.
*Every Heronian triangle has a rational circumradius (the radius of its circumscribed circle): For a general triangle the circumradius equals one-fourth the product of the sides divided by the area; in a Heronian triangle the sides and area are integers.
*In a Heronian triangle the distance from the centroid to each side is rational because, for all triangles, this distance is the ratio of twice the area to three times the side length. This can be generalized by stating that all centers associated with Heronian triangles whose barycentric coordinates are rational ratios have a rational distance to each side. These centers include the circumcenter, orthocenter, nine-point center, symmedian point, Gergonne point and Nagel point.
*Every Heronian triangle can be placed on a unit-sided square lattice with each vertex at a lattice point. As a corollary, every rational Heronian triangle can be placed into a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with all rational-valued coordinates.

==Properties of side lengths==
Here are some properties of side lengths of Heronian triangles, whose side lengths are and area is .
*Every primitive Heronian triangle has one even and two odd sides (see ). It follows that a Heronian triangle has either one or three sides of even length, and that the perimeter of a primitive Heronian triangle is always an even number. 
*There are no equilateral Heronian triangles, since a primitive Heronian triangle has one even side length and two odd side lengths.
*The area of a Heronian triangle is always divisible by 6.
*There are no Heronian triangles with a side length of either 1 or 2.
*There exist an infinite number of primitive Heronian triangles with one side length equal to a given , provided that .
*The semiperimeter of a Heronian triangle cannot be prime (as formula_29 is the square of the area, and the area is an integer, if were prime, it would divide another factor; this is impossible as these factors are all less than ).
*In a Heronian triangles that has no integer altitude (indecomposable and non-Pythagorean), all side lengths have a prime factor of the form . In a primitive Pythagoran triangle, all prime factors of the hypotenuse have the form . A decomposable Heronian triangle must have two sides that are the hypotenuse of a Pythagorean triangle, and thus two sides that have prime factors of the form . There may also be prime factors of the form , since the Pythagorean components of a decomposable Heronian triangle need not to be primitive, even if the Heronian triangle is primitive. In summary, all Heronian triangles have at least one side that is divisible by a prime of the form .
*There are no Heronian triangles whose side lengths form a geometric progression.
*If any two sides (but not three) of a Heronian triangle have a common factor, that factor must be the sum of two squares.

==Parametrizations==

A parametric equation or &quot;parametrization&quot; of Heronian triangles consists of an expression of the side lengths and area of a triangle as functionstypically polynomial functionsof some parameters, such that the triangle is Heronian if and only if the parameters satisfy some constraintstypically, to be positive integers satisfying some inequalities. It is also generally required that all Heronian triangles can be obtained up to a scaling for some values of the parameters, and that these values are unique, if an order on the sides of the triangle is specified.

The first such parametrization was discovered by Brahmagupta (598-668 A.D.), who did not prove that all Heronian triangles can be generated by the parametrization. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler provided another parametrization and proved that it generates all Heronian triangles. These parametrizations are described in the next two subsections.

In the third subsection, a rational parametrizationthat is a parametrization where the parameters are positive rational numbersis naturally derived from properties of Heronian triangles. Both Brahmagupta&#x27;s and Euler&#x27;s parametrizations can be recovered from this rational parametrization by clearing denominators. This provides a proof that Brahmagupta&#x27;s and Euler&#x27;s parametrizations generate all Heronian triangles.

===Brahmagupta&#x27;s parametric equation===
The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (598-668 A.D.) discovered the following parametric equations for generating Heronian triangles, but did not prove that every similarity class of Heronian triangles can be obtained this way.

For three positive integers , and that are setwise coprime (formula_30) and satisfy formula_31 (to guarantee positive side lengths) and (for uniqueness):

:formula_32

where is the semiperimeter, is the area, and is the inradius.

The resulting Heronian triangle is not always primitive, and a scaling may be needed for getting the corresponding primitive triangle. For example, taking , and produces a triangle with , and , which is similar to the Heronian triangle with a proportionality factor of .

The fact that the generated triangle is not primitive is an obstacle for using this parametrization for generating all Heronian triangles with size lengths less than a given bound, since the size of formula_33 cannot be predicted.

===Euler&#x27;s parametric equation===
The following method of generating all Heronian triangles was discovered by Leonhard Euler, who was the first to provably parametrize all such triangles.

For four positive integers coprime to and coprime to satisfying formula_34 (to guarantee positive side lengths):

:formula_35

where is the semiperimeter, is the area, and is the inradius.

Even when , , , and are pairwise coprime, the resulting Heronian triangle may not be primitive. In particular, if , , , and are all odd, the three side lengths are even. It is also possible that , , and have a common divisor other than . For example, with , , , and , one gets , where each side length is a multiple of ; the corresponding primitive triple is , which can also be obtained by dividing the triple resulting from by two, then exchanging and .

===Half-angle tangent parametrization===
Let formula_36 be the side lengths of any triangle, let formula_37 be the interior angles opposite these sides, and let formula_38 formula_39 and formula_40 be the half-angle tangents. The values formula_41 are all positive and satisfy formula_42; this &quot;triple tangent identity&quot; is the half-angle tangent version of the fundamental triangle identity written as formula_43 radians (that is, 90°), as can be proved using the addition formula for tangents. By the laws of sines and cosines, all of the sines and the cosines of formula_37 are rational numbers if the triangle is a rational Heronian triangle and, because a half-angle tangent is a rational function of the sine and cosine, it follows that the half-angle tangents are also rational.

Conversely, if formula_41 are positive rational numbers such that formula_46 it can be seen that they are the half-angle tangents of the interior angles of a class of similar Heronian triangles. The condition formula_42 can be rearranged to formula_48 and the restriction formula_49 requires formula_50 Thus there is a bijection between the similarity classes of rational Heronian triangles and the pairs of positive rational numbers formula_51 whose product is less than .

To make this bijection explicit, one can choose, as a specific member of the similarity class, the triangle inscribed in a unit-diameter circle with side lengths equal to the sines of the opposite angles:
:formula_52
where formula_53 is the semiperimeter, formula_54 is the area, formula_55 is the inradius, and all these values are rational because formula_56 and formula_57 are rational.

To obtain an (integral) Heronian triangle, the denominators of , , and must be cleared. There are several ways to do this. If formula_58 and formula_59 with formula_60 (irreducible fractions), and the triangle is scaled up by formula_61 the result is Euler&#x27;s parametrization. If formula_62 and formula_63 with formula_64 (lowest common denominator), and the triangle is scaled up by formula_65 the result is similar but not quite identical to Brahmagupta&#x27;s parametrization. If, instead, this is formula_66 and formula_67 that are reduced to the lowest common denominator, that is, if formula_68 and formula_69 with formula_70 then one gets exactly Brahmagupta&#x27;s parametrization by scaling up the triangle by formula_71

This proves that either parametrization generates all Heronian triangles.

The values of , and that give the set of triangles that are geometrically similar to the triangle with side lengths , , and , semiperimeter , and area are , , and .

==Other results==

 has derived fast algorithms for generating Heronian triangles.

There are infinitely many primitive and indecomposable non-Pythagorean Heronian triangles with integer values for the inradius formula_72 and all three of the exradii formula_73, including the ones generated by

:formula_74

There are infinitely many Heronian triangles that can be placed on a lattice such that not only are the vertices at lattice points, as holds for all Heronian triangles, but additionally the centers of the incircle and excircles are at lattice points.

==Examples==
The list of primitive integer Heronian triangles, sorted by area and, if this is the same,
by perimeter, starts as in the following table.
&quot;Primitive&quot; means that 
the greatest common divisor of the three side lengths equals 1.

The list of primitive Heronian triangles whose sides do not exceed 6,000,000 has been computed by .

==Heronian triangles with perfect square sides==
Heronian triangles with perfect square sides are related to the Perfect cuboid problem. As of February 2021, only two &quot;primitive&quot; Heronian triangles with perfect square sides are known:

(1853, 4380, 4427, Area=), published in 2013.

(11789, 68104, 68595, Area=), published in 2018.

==Equable triangles==
A shape is called equable if its area equals its perimeter. There are exactly five equable Heronian triangles: the ones with side lengths (5,12,13), (6,8,10), (6,25,29), (7,15,20), and (9,10,17), though only four of them are primitive.

==Almost-equilateral Heronian triangles==

Since the area of an equilateral triangle with rational sides is an irrational number, no equilateral triangle is Heronian. However, a sequence of isosceles Heronian triangles that are &quot;almost equilateral&quot; can be developed from the duplication of right-angled triangles, in which the hypotenuse is almost twice as long as one of the legs. The first few examples of these almost-equilateral triangles are listed in the following table :
There is a unique sequence of Heronian triangles that are &quot;almost equilateral&quot; because the three sides are of the form , , . A method for generating all solutions to this problem based on continued fractions was described in 1864 by Edward Sang, and in 1880 Reinhold Hoppe gave a closed-form expression for the solutions. The first few examples of these almost-equilateral triangles are listed in the following table :
Subsequent values of can be found by multiplying the previous value by 4, then subtracting the value prior to that one (, , etc.), thus:

:formula_75

where denotes any row in the table. This is a Lucas sequence. Alternatively, the formula formula_76 generates all for positive integers . Equivalently, let and , then,

:formula_77

where are solutions to . A small transformation yields a conventional Pell equation , the solutions of which can then be derived from the regular continued fraction expansion for .

The variable is of the form formula_78, where is 7, 97, 1351, 18817, ... The numbers in this sequence have the property that consecutive integers have integral standard deviation.

<text>Sorel-Tracy (; ) is a city in southwestern Quebec, Canada and the geographical end point of the Champlain Valley. It is located at the confluence of the Richelieu River and the St. Lawrence River, on the western edge of Lac Saint-Pierre, downstream and northeast of Montreal. The population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 35,165. Its mayor is Patrick Péloquin and it is the seat of the Pierre-De Saurel Regional County Municipality and the judicial district of Richelieu.

The city is the result of a voluntary merger in March 2000 between two former municipalities, Sorel and Tracy, which developed on opposite shores of the Richelieu River: Tracy on the west shore and Sorel on the east shore. Sorel itself had annexed in 1992 the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Sorel; today it forms the southern part of its territory.

Sorel was founded in 1642. Tracy was founded on February 10, 1954, but prior to that, it was a parish municipality known as Saint-Joseph de Sorel. (This is not to be confused with the town of Saint-Joseph-de-Sorel, an independent municipality north of Tracy).

Sorel-Tracy is known for manufacturing related to the steel industry and metallurgy. It has a ferry linking the city to the village of Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola. Its shipyard built units of three frigates for the Canadian forces, and two ships in the late 1960s.

==History==
Early exploration in this area by the French was a catalyst for armed conflict with various indigenous peoples. The French also learned about existing rivalries among these nations and sought to build its own alliances with First Nations. The Battle of Sorel occurred on June 19, 1610: Samuel de Champlain had some French regulars or local militia, as well as First Nations allies, the Wyandot (also known as Huron by the French), Algonquin and Innu peoples. Together they held off the powerful Mohawk people in New France.
Sorel is the fourth-oldest city in the province of Quebec. Its formation began in 1642 when Charles Huault de Montmagny, first Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of New France, built Fort Richelieu here as a defense for settlers and river travellers against the Iroquois, primarily the Mohawk, the powerful easternmost nation in the Confederacy based south of the Great Lakes.

In 1647, the original fort was destroyed by the Mohawk, but it was rebuilt by the Carignan-Salières Regiment on the same site in 1665.

The name Sorel comes from the first seigneur of the area, Pierre de Saurel. He was in command of a company of the Carignan-Salières Regiment that landed in New France in August 1665. He was granted a seigneury by King Louis XIV in 1672, after having already built a manor house four years prior. The parish of Tracy was named for Lieutenant General Alexander de Prouville, Sieur de Tracy, who was overall in command of the Carignan-Salières Regiment directly under the Governor.

After Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester visited Sorel in 1787, the town took the name of William-Henry, a name it retained until 1845.

It is probable that before the American Revolution, there were no English-speaking, Protestant people in Sorel, as it had been settled by French-speaking colonists and their descendants, who were primarily Catholic. Although a hamlet or small village, it was the scene of much activity during the war and after.

During 1776 large bodies of troops passed through and at times were stationed in the area. For example, the English quartered in Sorel the German auxiliaries they hired after they reached Quebec. Governor Frederick Haldimand wrote a letter to Lord George Germain in October 1778, from his camp in Sorel where fortifications were in progress, proposing his use of the Seigneurie,

It is my intention therefore, if time and circumstances favour me, to make Sorel a place of strength with Permanent Works, as the importance of it deserves. The Seigneurie of this Place is vested in merchants residing in England and the Inhabitants of it, people remarkable for their courage and resolution, have distinguished themselves very much by their attachment to the Government even at a time the Rebels were Masters of that Country, in which account I think it would serve the King&#x27;s interest to bestow some Public mark of favour upon them such as remitting them the Quitrents which they pay for their land, to the Seigneur, and the Seigneurie being to be sold, and the purchase would not exceed 13,000, having been offered for that sum, I submit to Your Lordship whether it would not be best to give orders to treat immediately with the Proprietors, Messrs. Greenwood and Higgins in London, both for enabling me to effect the purchase...

The Crown purchased the land in 1781, at the end of the war, and Sorel became a clearing house for the steady stream of Loyalist refugees from the south. A number settled in Sorel, forming the nucleus of the English-speaking population. Also, the Crown selected Sorel as one of the stations for &quot;Military Invalids&quot;, or “Outside Chelsea Pensioners&quot;, as they were also called. Several hundred older veterans and their dependents were sent to Sorel under the medical care of Dr. Christopher Carter. There facilities had to be built for them.

The earliest British efforts for the propagation of the Protestant religion in Lower Canada started in Sorel. With the continued influx of Loyalists during 1783 into the Seigniory (as the English spell it), the settlement sought a permanent Protestant minister. That year they sent a petition to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, of the Anglican Church, begging them to send a Minister of the Gospel to reside in the Seigniory.

The Reverend John Doty was assigned to the post, embarking during the month of April 1784 at Gravesend, England, and arriving at Quebec in June. He reached Sorel on 4 July 1784, where he celebrated Divine Service (or communion) and preached his first sermon. This is the date of the foundation of the Anglican parish in Sorel and the first Anglican mission in Canada.

They used as the chapel a wooden building located at the end of King Street, a few steps from the Richelieu market. This building had earlier served as a military storehouse. In 1819, the town&#x27;s parsonage was declared dangerously unfit.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Sorel was a center of fur traders, who had been established in Quebec and among the indigenous peoples from the earliest years of the colony. The character of the town changed over the next few decades as more permanent settlers arrived.

In the 1820s, Sorel was the site of the governor&#x27;s house for the Governor General of Lower Canada, then George Ramsay, the Lord Dalhousie. (He is the namesake of Dalhousie University.) Ramsay quickly purchased land in the area to be developed for agriculture. Due to his presence, the small town became a centre for the turbulent politics of that time, in the period leading up to the Lower Canada Rebellion.

Locally, the colonial governor and parish priest Jean-Baptiste Kelly competed for power and influence among the different ethnic groups. Kelly oversaw a number of improvements and changes during his years in the town. The &quot;dangerous&quot; parsonage was rebuilt by 1832 (using stone from the original). The town changed its name back to Sorel from William-Henry in 1845, reflecting its demographics and predominately French Catholic population.

Kelly helped improve the parish library, which contained four hundred volumes by 1846. In 1848 the community erected a monument to temperance. They established a society for the care of the poor and sick, and for the education of girls. Kelly retired in 1849, after the completion of a new clergy house. The older one was adapted for use as a college. In the long term, the town continued to be settled primarily by French Canadians, rather than developing any sizable Anglo-Canadian population.

In 1839 two residents were defendants in a murder trial. An American, George Holmes, who lived in Sorel, was linked to Joséphine d’Estimauville, a married woman who had been staying with her mother in Sorel after leaving her abusive husband. The pair were arrested after Holmes became a suspect for killing her husband Louis-Pascal-Achille Taché (21 June 1813 – 31 January 1839), seigneur of Kamouraska since 1833. This seigneury was located in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region of eastern Quebec. Holmes fled to the United States, escaped extradition, and disappeared. D’Estimauville was tried for complicity in the death of her husband, but acquitted.

In 1970, Anne Hébert published a novel, &quot;Kamouraska&quot;, inspired by the affair. It was adapted as a 1973 film of the same name, directed by Claude Jutra and starring Geneviève Bujold and Richard Jordan.

The shipyards in Sorel were long important to its economy. In the late 20th century, the city was the site of construction of three of 12 s of the Canadian Forces. The three Canadian patrol frigates built in Quebec were , and . The shipyard in Sorel-Tracy was called M.I.L. Tracy. It built units for all three vessels and sent them by barge for final assembly at M.I.L. Davie in Lauzon, Quebec.

Previous to the construction of the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates, MIL (Marine Industries Ltd, operated by the Simard family of Sorel, constructed , which was commissioned there in 1964. MIL was also the site of construction of , an experimental hydrofoil commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy. The construction of both these ships was overseen by Cmdr. Donald Clark CD RCN.

==Economy==
The city is home to the Tracy Thermal Generating Station.

The city is home to a shipyard, which built several Royal Canadian Navy ships in the 20th century.

The city is home to QIT-Fer et Titane, a Titanium smelter and refinery now owned by the Rio Tinto corporation.

===Transportation===
Sorel-Tracy is within of both Montreal and Trois-Rivières and is easily accessible via Autoroute 30 from the west and via Route 132 from the east and west. Autoroute 30 stops at Sorel and picks up again at Bécancour, leaving an incomplete segment in between.

A year-round ferry operates on the St. Lawrence River between Sorel-Tracy and Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola on the way to Berthierville.

<doc id="731977" wikidata="Q2722495" url="?curid=731977" title="2004 European Parliament election in Poland">
<text>Elections to the European Parliament were held in Poland on 13 June 2004. 20.87% of eligible citizens voted; of these, 97.33% of the votes cast were valid. The elections resulted in a heavy defeat for the governing Alliance of the Democratic Left and Labor Union parties, although the very low turnout makes a direct comparison with national election results difficult. As expected the most successful party was the Civic Platform. Second place was taken by the strongly anti-EU League of Polish Families.

The radical populist Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, which some opinion polls had predicted would come second, came fourth after the Law and Justice party. The election results were a success for Social Democracy of Poland, which managed to cross the required 5% threshold, and the Freedom Union, which got over twice the expected percentage of votes.

<text>Côte Saint-Luc () is a city on the Island of Montreal in Quebec, Canada. It is a mostly residential suburb of Montreal, within which it forms an enclave. The city is primarily English-speaking, with a large Jewish community.

==Geography==
Côte Saint-Luc, along with Hampstead and Montreal West, forms an enclave within the City of Montreal. Côte Saint-Luc itself contains two distinct exclaves that are nestled between Hampstead and Montreal. The larger of the two contains a residential development north of Hampstead and the Decarie Square Mall, while the smaller one consists of fifteen residential buildings along Macdonald Avenue. 

About a third of Côte Saint-Luc&#x27;s territory is occupied by the Canadian Pacific rail yards.

==History==

The area encompassing Côte Saint-Luc was first settled in the 18th century, and was incorporated as a village in 1903. Its name may commemorate the 18th-century military officer Luc de la Corne Saint-Luc.

Throughout the 1920s, the town grew quickly and accepted many immigrant populations leaving Montreal, notably German-Jewish and British families. Railway development and industrial activities were relocated to the north. An example of this is an old farmhouse, near the intersection of Westminster and Côte Saint-Luc, which today is a strip mall.

Still, Côte Saint-Luc remained a small agricultural community until the mid-20th century. The population grew from 747 residents to over 20,000 between 1940 and the mid-1960s, due to substantial immigration following World War II. It was officially incorporated as a town in 1951, and as a city in 1958.

Côte Saint-Luc was forcibly merged with the city of Montreal on January 1, 2002. It was amalgamated with its neighbouring suburbs of Hampstead and Montreal West to form the borough of Côte-Saint-Luc—Hampstead—Montréal-Ouest. In a referendum held on June 20, 2004, Côte Saint-Luc residents voted to demerge; Côte Saint-Luc was re-established as a separate city on January 1, 2006.

== Demographics ==
According to the Office québécois de la langue française, Côte Saint-Luc has been officially recognized as a bilingual municipality since 2005.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Côte Saint-Luc had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Outside Israel, Côte-Saint-Luc contains the world&#x27;s seventh largest Jewish community as a percentage of total population, with 69.1% of the population being Jewish.


==Local government==
=== Municipal council === 
===Mayors===
The former mayors of Côte Saint-Luc are as follows:

* Luc Prud&#x27;homme (1903–1905)
* Pierre Lemieux (1905–1909, 1912–1938)
* François-Xavier Décarie (1909–1912) (resigned)
* Frederick D. Lamont (1938–1939) (resigned)
* Donald Fletcher (1939–1951)
* John P. Fyon (1951–1953)
* J.-Adalbert Paris (1953–1963)
* Samuel Moskovitch (1963–1976) (died in office)
* Bernard Lang (1976–1998)
* Robert Libman (1998–2002)
* Anthony Housefather (2006–2016)
* Mitchell Brownstein (2016–present)
==Public services and education==
Côte Saint-Luc operates a full-time Public Security Department that enforces municipal by-laws, and in 2006 launched the Volunteer Citizens on Patrol () program that allows residents to help deter crime. Côte Saint-Luc also runs the only volunteer EMS first responder system on the island of Montreal, which responds to more than 3,000 calls early. Advanced care and transportation to local hospitals is provided by Urgences-santé. In 2008–2009, the Montreal Fire Department implemented an island-wide first responder system set to replace the Côte Saint-Luc EMS; however, the city fought to keep their system and private member&#x27;s bill was passed in the National Assembly of Quebec to exclude Côte Saint-Luc from the Montreal Fire Department.

The city&#x27;s Eleanor London Côte Saint-Luc Public Library was named in honour of Eleanor London, who served as the city&#x27;s chief librarian for 36 years. The Eleanor London Côte Saint-Luc Library is one of few libraries in North America that is open every day of the year.

The Cavendish Mall was once the city&#x27;s central hub, housing stores like Steinberg&#x27;s, Eaton&#x27;s and Discus. In recent years, part of the mall has been replaced with single family homes, townhouses and apartment buildings.

The Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys (CSMB) operates two Francophone primary schools in Côte Saint-Luc: École de la Mosaïque and École des Amis-du-Monde. The English Montreal School Board operates a French immersion school, Merton School, John Grant and Mountainview High Schools, and the Marymount Adult Centre. There are a number of private schools in the city, including JPPS–Bialik, Hebrew Academy, École Maïmonide and Yeshiva Yavne.

==Notable people==
Former residents of Côte Saint-Luc include politician and lawyer Irwin Cotler, actor William Shatner, and poet Irving Layton. Other residents included Montreal Expos all-star catcher Gary Carter. Comedy screenwriter Ricky Blitt and older brother Barry Blitt, a magazine illustrator, were raised there. Author Gordon Korman grew up in Côte Saint-Luc, as did popular science author and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker.

McKinley has fielded girls teams in basketball, volleyball, and swimming as early as in the 1910s. Some years even fielded girls baseball team before softball became recognized as its own sport. The yearbooks of those early years noted games often against St. Andrew&#x27;s Priory, YWCA, Palama, Normal School (later merged with University of Hawaii&#x27;s College of Education), and even College of Hawaii (now known as University of Hawaii). McKinley was a founding member of the Interscholastic League of Honolulu in 1909 alongside Punahou and Kamehameha. In 1970, McKinley left the ILH with four other Honolulu area public schools to join the OIA.

The 1933 football team traveled across the Pacific Ocean and went on to defeat Weber College (now known as Weber State University), BYU freshmen team, and Ricks College (now known as BYU-Idaho). Ricks College traveled to Honolulu the following year. McKinley won again by the score of 24–6 in a game attended by about 19,000 fans.

<text>Atlatlahucan (from the Nahuatl word ) is a city in the Mexican state of Morelos. The name means &quot;Place of red or brown water&quot;, and today the water is stored in a type of cistern called a &quot;jagüey&quot;. To the north is the State of Mexico, south is Cuautla, east is Yecapixtla, and west are Tlayacapan and Yautepec. It stands at ,

at a mean height of 1,656 metres (5,433 ft.) above sea level. The municipality covers 71 km2 (27.4 square miles).

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality reported 22,079 inhabitants in the 2015 census. The population of the municipality of Atlatlahucan was 25,232 and the city of Atlatlahucan was 9,018 in 2020.

==History==
The Xochimilcas extended their conquest to Totolapan and Atlatlahucan in 1436. Moctezuma Ilhuicamina expanded his conquests in the Morelos valley include to Atlatlahucan, which was forced to pay tribute to the Aztec sovereign.

After the Spanish conquest, the town ignored its annexation to the &quot;Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca&quot;. In 1533, Augustinian friars &quot;Jerónimo de San Esteban&quot; and &quot;Jorge de Ávila&quot; arrived. They built a parish church that was secularized in 1548. A monastery was founded in 1570, although the actual date may be a bit later because the town was still subject to Totolapan at that time.

Atlatlahucan was an assistant municipality of Tlayacapan, but on December 25, 1932, it became a municipality in its own right. &quot;Ignacio Bello&quot; was chosen as the first municipal president.

On August 24, 1964, the town was the site of an explosion that killed 37 people and injured 40 others, after a stockpile of fireworks went off prematurely while stored next to two tanks of butane. 

&quot;Calixto Urbano Lagunas&quot; of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition) was elected &quot;Presidente Municipal&quot; (municipal president) in the election of July 1, 2018.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020; five cases were reported in Atlatahucan. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. The state office of DIF sent food and water to vulnerable groups of people in eight municipalities including Atlatlahucan on May 26. On June 2, Atlatlahucan reported twelve confirmed cases and two deaths; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Atlatahucan reported 33 cases, 25 recuperations, and five deaths as of August 31. Sixty-one cases were reported on December 27,2020.

==Tourist Attractions==
===Ex-Convento de San Mateo Apóstol===
The monastery of San Mateo Atlatahucan was founded by Fray Jorge de Avila of the order of the Augustinians (1570?), who also founded the temples and of Tlayacapan, Ocuituco, Yecapixtla, and Totolapan. All these monasteries are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 

The complex is rectangular. There is an open chapel in the northwest corner built with three arches. The façade of the church has an undecorated arched door; above that is a rectangular coral window set in a niche surrounded by small pilasters. Above that, there is a classic clock dating from the latter part of the 19th century. To the rear of the church, there is a bell tower which appears to have been built later than the church, although it is in the same style.

The cloister is simple and austere, without luxury or decorations, in sharp contrast to the public areas of the church, tower, open chapel, and &quot;capillas posas&quot; used for unbaptized Indigenous. 

The feast of St. Matthew the Apostle is September 21.

===Other attractions===
Thirteen neighborhoods were built with their respective chapels of &quot;Los Reyes&quot;, &quot;La Asunción, Santa Ana, San Sebastian, San Andrés, Santa Barbara, San Lucas, Santo Tomás, San Marcos, Santiago, San Antonio, San Juan Evangelista&quot;, and &quot;San Miguel&quot;, of which only four still stand: &quot;Capilla de los Reyes&quot; (the Three Kings) and &quot;Capilla de la Asunción&quot; (the Assumption) in Atlatlhucan; &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; in Texcalpan (feast day, June 24); &quot;San Miguel Arcángel&quot; in Tlatetelco (feast day, September 29).

Major festivals are &quot;Carnaval&quot; on the Fourth Sunday of Lent and the &quot;Festivity of Christ Appeared&quot;. According to Catholic tradition, Jesus made twelve appearances between his Resurrection and Ascension. This is celebrated in Atlatlalhucan in &quot;La Cuevita&quot; (the Little Cave). A brass band usually accompanies the &quot;Dance of the Chinelos&quot; during the festivals.

<doc id="731991" wikidata="Q4117948" url="?curid=731991" title="Military of the Grand Duchy of Finland">
<text>Between 1809 and 1917, Finland was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire as the Grand Duchy of Finland. Between 1881 and 1901, the grand duchy had its own army. Before that, several other military units had also been formed.

The Grand Duchy inherited its allotment system (, ) from the Swedish military organization. However, for several decades, Russian rulers did not require military service from Finland – operations and defence were mostly taken care by Russian troops based in the grand duchy. As a result, officer benefits of the allotment system became practically pensions, as payment was based on passive availability, not on actual service.

The Diet of Finland made a pact with Tsar Alexander I; Finland paid a tax to Russia as compensation and military service was not called. This lasted until the Crimean War, 1854, during and after which Finland set up some sharpshooter battalions based on rote system.

== Napoleonic wars ==
In March 1810, Tsar Alexander I ordered the dissolution for 50 years of the Finnish units that had been part of the Swedish Army. At the same time, the allotment system remained as the basis of Finnish military organization. As a result of Alexander&#x27;s order, enlisted men were not drafted, but officers, non-commissioned officers and military officials retained their previous benefits. A Senate military affairs committee was set up in 1809 to handle all matters pertaining to the allotment system.

Upon Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia in 1812, the Minister–Secretary of State for Finland in St. Petersburg, Count Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, advocated for a recruited force of 2,400 light Jäger, who would operate on skis in the winter. Essentially in accordance with Armfelt&#x27;s proposals, Tsar Alexander on 16 September 1812 ordered the establishment of three Jäger regiments, each with a strength of 1,200 men. The recruits were supposed to be volunteers, but already by early October 1812, vagabonds and men without legal protection were being impressed into service in the regiments. The mission of these forces was to defend Finland, but they could also be sent to defend other Baltic areas.

As was typical for the era, military training was a matter of formality, with the Viipuri Jäger Regiment only receiving gunpowder and cartridges after pulling security duty in St. Petersburg for two months. Only then were the men trained to load and fire their rifles. Three firing exercises were held annually and each time the men would shoot four times from a distance of 80 paces (61 meters). None of the regiments took part in any combat. All were disbanded in 1830.

A training battalion formed in 1827 was renamed Finnish Guards&#x27; Sharpshooter Battalion (, ) which was more commonly known as the Guard of Finland (, ). It remained as a unit of the Russian Imperial Guard until 1905 when it was disbanded. The Cadet school in Hamina was founded in 1812 and existed until 1903. A (, ) was founded in 1846, but later disbanded in 1860.

A Navy unit, the First Finnish Naval Equipage (, ) was founded in 1830. It had up to 1,000 men and officers. It was succeeded by the Finnish Cadre Equipage (, ) in 1862.
The ships were mostly small sailing vessels, but also comprised a couple of bigger steam frigates, the &quot;Rurik&quot; and the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, named after the Finnish national epic. The Second Finnish Naval Equipage (, ) was founded during the Åland War, part of the Crimean War. Finnish Navy artillery-men fought against the British and French fleets from the Santahamina island shore batteries during the siege of Fortress Sveaborg in Helsinki.

Naval crewmen were greatly reduced in number during the 1860s and 1870s and finally the unit was disbanded in the 1880s.

The naval personnel were housed in a garrison building in Katajanokka called () in Helsinki. Today, the building houses the foreign ministry.

== Crimean war ==
During the Crimean War, nine battalions were formed in Finland. The soldiers were drafted using the allotment system, a remnant from the Swedish time. The battalions were disbanded in 1867.

== The conscription act of 1878 ==

During the 1860s, conscription was seen as an effective way to maintain an army. In 1878, a law was passed by the Diet of Finland and the Emperor Alexander II calling for a general conscription in Finland. The result was an army that was separated from the Russian army. The army was to consist of only Finnish citizens and was to be led by the Governor-General of Finland. The maximum number of men in the army was set to 5,600 and it was to consist of:

* Henkivartioväen 3. Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Helsinki) / &quot;Лейб-гвардии 3-й стрелковый Финский батальон (г. Гельсингфорс)&quot;
* Suomen 1. Uudenmaan Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Helsinki) / &quot;1-й Нюландский финский стрелковый батальон (г. Гельсингфорс)&quot;
* Suomen 2. Turun Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Turku) / &quot;2-й Абоский финский стрелковый батальон (г. Або)&quot;
* Suomen 3. Vaasan Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Vaasa) / &quot;3-й Вазаский финский стрелковый батальон (г. Николайстад)&quot;
* Suomen 4. Oulun Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Oulu) / &quot;4-й Улеаборгский финский стрелковый батальон (г. Улеаборг)&quot;
* Suomen 5. Kuopion Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Kuopio) / &quot;5-й Куопиоский финский стрелковый батальон (г. Куопио)&quot;
* Suomen 6. Mikkelin Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Mikkeli) / &quot;6-й Санкт-Михельский финский стрелковый батальон (г. Санкт-Михель)&quot;
* Suomen 7. Hämeenlinnan Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Hämeenlinna) / &quot;7-й Тавастгусский финский стрелковый батальон (г. Тавастгус)&quot;
* Suomen 8. Viipurin Tarkk&#x27;ampujapataljoona (Viipuri) / &quot;8-й Выборгский финский стрелковый батальон (г. Выборг)&quot;
* Suomen Rakuunarykmentti (Lappeenranta) (1890) / &quot;Финский драгунский полк (г. Вильманстранд)&quot;
* Suomen Kadettikoulu (Hamina) / &quot;Финский кадетский корпус (г. Фридрихсгам)&quot;

== Organisation ==
The battalions were founded in 1880–1881 and reached full strength in 1883. Each infantry battalion consisted of four companies. The Finnish Dragoon Regiment (, ) consisted of six squadrons (). Thirty-two reserve companies were formed in 1883. The conscripts were selected by a lottery. For those selected to serve, the period of service was three years. However, those with a comprehensive education (at least four years at school) had a service period of two years. The conscripts who were university students served only a year. Those not selected to serve the full period served one month each summer for three years in the reserve company of their region.

== Uniforms ==
All Finnish line units wore the dark green uniforms of the Imperial Russian infantry and dragoons but with light blue facings as a distinction. The Guards Sharpshooters&#x27; Battalion wore yellow facings on its dark green uniform, until it was disbanded in 1905.

== Disbandment ==
Between 1901 and 1905, the separate Finnish army battalions underwent a series of disbandments, concluding with that of the Guards Sharpshooters&#x27; Battalion. This was part of the political &quot;oppression years&quot; which saw a downgrading of the autonomous status of the grand duchy within the Russian Empire.

The original intention was that Finnish recruits would continue to serve but in regular Russian units of the Imperial Russian Army stationed elsewhere. This however met with widespread opposition, with under half of the conscripts called for service in 1902 reporting for training. Accordingly, conscription in Finland was terminated in 1905. A special tax was substituted; to be paid from the Finnish Senate to the Imperial treasury.

<doc id="731992" wikidata="Q720722" url="?curid=731992" title="Pimp C">
<text>Chad Lamont Butler (December 29, 1973 – December 4, 2007), better known by his stage name Pimp C, was an American rapper and record producer. He was best known for his work with Bun B as one half of the hip-hop duo Underground Kingz (UGK).

Signing to Jive in 1992, UGK released their major-label debut studio album &quot;Too Hard to Swallow&quot; to critical acclaim. The group followed this with their second and third major-label albums &quot;Super Tight&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Ridin&#x27; Dirty&quot; in 1996, both of which charted in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 to further success. The group received national attention in 2000 after being featured on Jay-Z&#x27;s hit single &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;&quot;, which peaked at #18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #1 on the Rhythmic Top 40.

The group went on hiatus for the first half of the 2000s after Pimp C was sentenced to eight years in prison for a probation violation. During this time both members pursued solo careers, with Pimp C releasing his solo debut, &quot;The Sweet James Jones Stories&quot;, in 2005, composed of material recorded prior to his sentencing. After being released from prison in December 2005, he released his second solo album, &quot;Pimpalation&quot;, in 2006. UGK released their eponymous fifth studio album in 2007, which spawned the single &quot;International Players Anthem (I Choose You)&quot; featuring OutKast, which peaked at #70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Pimp C was found dead in his hotel room on December 4, 2007, with a coroner&#x27;s report attributing his death to complications stemming from heavy consumption of lean and his pre-existing condition of sleep apnea.

==Early life==
Chad Lamont Butler was born December 29, 1973, in Crowley, Louisiana, but was raised in Port Arthur, Texas. Butler was the only child of Charleston Butler and Weslyn &quot;Mama Wes&quot; Butler Jacob Monroe. Butler was born prematurely and had numerous health issues, including a birth defect that caused his legs to point inward, which required braces to fix. He also had to be propped up when he slept due to digestive problems. His eyesight was poor, and he almost went blind after a severe bout of pinkeye. Butler also had pneumonia at least nine times as a child.

As the son of a trumpet player, Butler had an interest in music since childhood: &quot;I come from a classical background, I came up singing Italian sonnets, Negro spirituals, and shit of that nature.&quot; Even before studying musical notation in school, he learned to play many instruments by ear, including piano, trumpet, drums and flugelhorn. His vocal style was once described as &quot;high-voiced, unstable and provocateur, as likely to slap your face as to sing you a love song.&quot; Influenced by Run-DMC, he started synthesizing beats to rap over after receiving a drum machine and keyboard one Christmas.

Butler joined the choir as a teenager and played numerous instruments at school, and after being encouraged by his stepfather Bill Monroe, began writing and creating his own music. Butler was particularly interested in the emerging hip hop genre as a child, and soon bonded and became friends with Bernard &quot;Bun B&quot; Freeman over their shared passion for music.

==Career==
===UGK===
====Early career (1987–1996)====

Butler formed the rap group Underground Kingz (often referred to as UGK) with friend Bernard &quot;Bun B&quot; Freeman in 1987 in Port Arthur, Texas. Initially signed to independent label Big Tyme Recordz, the duo released two EPs, &quot;The Southern Way&quot; and &quot;Banned&quot;, in 1992 to moderate local success, which lead to the group being signed to Jive Records later that year. In November, they released their major label debut, &quot;Too Hard to Swallow&quot; through Jive, which peaked at #37 on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

UGK&#x27;s second album, &quot;Super Tight&quot; was released in 1994 to critical acclaim and commercial success, charting at #95 on the Billboard 200 and #9 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. In 1996, UGK&#x27;s third album, &quot;Ridin&#x27; Dirty&quot;, became their most successful, reaching #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #15 on the Billboard 200, receiving widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, having sold 850,000 copies to date.

====Hiatus and national attention (1996–2001)====
After taking a short hiatus from music in the late 1990s, UGK returned in 2000, appearing on Jay-Z&#x27;s smash hit single &quot;Big Pimpin&#x27;&quot;, which peaked at #18 on the Billboard 200, as well as &quot;Sippin&#x27; on Some Syrup&quot; by Three 6 Mafia, which peaked at #30 on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. Both of these collaborations greatly increased the duo&#x27;s reputation, and helped fuel anticipation for their next project. Jive Records failed to capitalize on this new-found interest in UGK, as their fourth album, &quot;Dirty Money&quot;, was released in 2001 with little to no advertisement or promotion.

====Prison sentence and solo career (2002–2006)====
After Pimp C was sentenced to eight years in prison in August 2002, UGK was once again forced to go on hiatus, which led to both members pursuing solo careers. Pimp C&#x27;s debut studio album, The &quot;Sweet James Jones Stories&quot; was released in March 2005, composed of material recorded prior to Pimp C&#x27;s incarceration. After being released from prison in December 2005, Pimp C released his second solo studio album &quot;Pimpalation&quot; in July 2006 and peaked at #3 on the US Billboard 200 and topped the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

====UGK Reunited====
On August 7, 2007, UGK reunited to release their eponymous fifth studio album, debuting at #1 on both the Billboard 200 and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop charts. The album was the last UGK album released during Pimp C&#x27;s lifetime, and spawned the hit single &quot;International Players Anthem (I Choose You)&quot;, and received universal acclaim from critics.

==Personal life==
Butler married his wife, Chinara, while he was in prison in 2003. They had one child together, a daughter named Christian, and he had two older sons, Chad Lamont Butler II and Dahcory Butler, both of whom were born in previous relationships.

==Legal issues==
On December 16, 2000, Butler was arrested in Houston&#x27;s Sharpstown Mall after allegedly holding a woman, Lakita Hulett, at gunpoint and threatening to shoot her after a confrontation in a shoe store. After both Butler and Hulett had exchanged words in the store, Hulett alleged that Butler pushed a gun into her side and said, &quot;Bitch, I&#x27;ll shoot you,&quot; before she ran away and informed police. Butler claimed he simply lifted his jacket to show the gun and did not remove it from his waistband.

As Butler attempted to exit the mall and enter his car, numerous officers surrounded him and instructed him to surrender. Butler ignored the orders and was forced to the ground by officers, who handcuffed him and brought him back into the mall. Shortly after, Butler was transported to Houston Central Jail where he was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Butler claimed police used excessive force to restrain him, and alleged they knocked him unconscious twice and refused to let doctors at a local hospital perform a routine CT scan, instead transporting him straight to jail.

Butler posted $10,000 bail the following day and was initially sentenced to probation after pleading no contest in early 2001. He was sent back to prison in January 2002 after failing to report to his probation officer on several occasions, failing to keep up with his community service hours or pay outstanding court fees, as well as testing positive twice for marijuana. On August 5, 2002, Butler was sentenced to eight years in prison.

His arrest was widely protested by the hip-hop community, who along with Bun B immediately initiated a grassroots &quot;Free Pimp C&quot; campaign. Butler spent the later portion of his sentence at the Terrell Unit in Brazoria County, Texas and was transferred to the Huntsville Unit a week prior to his release. On December 30, 2005, Butler was released from prison and placed on parole until December 2009.

==Death==
In early December 2007, Butler had been staying at the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood, California, where he had been working on new music and performing with Too $hort. On the morning of December 4, 2007, he was scheduled to fly back home, where his wife, Chinara, was waiting with his cousin Ed at the airport to pick him up. After not hearing from him the morning of the scheduled flight, his wife called the hotel and requested that they check on him. Hotel staff discovered Butler unresponsive in his hotel room, where paramedics pronounced him dead shortly after. He was 33 years old.

The coroner&#x27;s report ruled that Butler&#x27;s death was accidental, attributing it to the effects of his heavy usage of &quot;lean&quot;, a combination of codeine and promethazine, in conjunction with his pre-existing condition of sleep apnea. Like many other Southern rappers, Butler referred to lean many times in his music.

According to DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia, Butler&#x27;s manager Rick Martin described seeing the rapper&#x27;s body &quot;laying down like he was praying but there was blood around like he was shot. They thought he was shot in the head, but they didn&#x27;t know what the hell happened because there was blood everywhere. They thought he was shot. He was knelt down like he was praying and the candles were all the way burnt down, so they knew he&#x27;d probably been dead for a day or so because he always lit those candles to sleep. He lit those big tall candles and they had been burnt down so he probably was dead for a while.&quot;

Butler&#x27;s body was transported back to his hometown of Port Arthur, Texas, where his funeral was held at the Bob Bowers Civic Center on December 13, 2007. Port Arthur mayor Deloris Prince, Butler&#x27;s mother Weslyn Monroe, and Bun B were among the speakers at the service. He was buried at Greenlawn Memorial Park in Jefferson County.

===Tributes===
Numerous rappers paid tribute to Butler in the wake of his passing. Bun B honored his cohort on songs such as &quot;You&#x27;re Everything&quot; and &quot;Pop It 4 Pimp&quot; on his 2008 album &quot;II Trill&quot;, while UGK&#x27;s final album, &quot;UGK 4 Life&quot;, was released in 2009. Lil&#x27; Flip released a tribute song, &quot;RIP Pimp C&quot;, two days after Butler&#x27;s death, and in 2008, Lil Wayne released a single titled “Me and My Drank”. A$AP Rocky has cited Pimp C as one of his major influences, while Megan Thee Stallion titled her 2018 EP &quot;Tina Snow&quot; after Butler&#x27;s alter ego Tony Snow.

<text>Axochiapan is a city in the Mexican state of Morelos. It stands at , at a mean height of above sea level. It is surrounded by the State of Puebla to the east and south, Jonacatepec to the north, and Tepalcingo to the west.

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality reported 35,689 inhabitants in the year 2015 census. In 2020 the municipality of Axochiapan had 39,174 inhabitants and the city of Axochiapan had 19,085.

Axochiapan is notable for the numbers of inhabitants that migrate north to the Minneapolis, Minnesota area.

== Etymology &amp; Shield ==
The origin of Axochiapan&#x27;s name comes from &quot;axochi-tl&quot;, which means “water flower or water lily”. This comes from the many white lilies that form like carpets on the ponds and lakes in the area. The shield&#x27;s appearance is due to the water lilies that are prevalent in the area. Its peeking out of the water conveys how, just like in real life, they rapidly grow and reproduce in water, particularly during the month of August.

== History ==
Axochiapan is a city with ancient Olmec and Tlahuican origins. They were dominated by the Aztec Empire. With the Spanish conquest, the village stopped paying tribute to the Aztec Empire and came under the rule of the Spanish Crown.

Axochiapan belonged to the municipality of Jonacatepec from 1824 to 1869. Later, the State of Morelos was created, which also created the municipality of Tetelilla. From 1869 to 1898, Axochiapan belonged to Tetelilla until it finally became its own municipality on November 9, 1898, covering territory that previously belonged to Tetelilla (with exception to a city which was integrated with Jonacatepec). Axochiapan&#x27;s first town hall was installed and the town&#x27;s first mayor, Luis G. Rebolledo, assumed office at that time.

A number of citizens from Axochiapan joined the fight during the Mexican Revolution, including Joaquín Camaño, Marcelino Rodríguez, Marcelino Vergara, Benigno Abundes, and José Palma.

The epicenter of the September 19, 2017 earthquake was 7.5 miles southeast of Axochiapan. Four people in the municipality were killed. The Secretary of Health reported that 243 homes were destroyed and 1,161 were damaged in the municipality.

Felix Sanchez Espinoza of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018.

While the state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020, no cases were reported in Axochiapan. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On April 1, members of the community threatened to burn the hospital if patients with COVID-19 were treated there; on May 5, one of the leaders died from COVID-19. Two people died of COVID-19 on June 6 and authorities delivered the bodies to the wrong families, but the mistake was discovered before cremation. One hundred thirty-eight cases were reported in the municipality on December 27, 2020. The hospital dedicated to the care of serious COVID-19 cases reached 100% capacity on January 15, 2021. Vaccinations for senior citizens (60+) are scheduled to begin on March 12, 2021.

Fifteen people died in Axochiapan, Jantetelco, and Tepalcingo due to adulterated alcohol on Mother&#x27;s Day. Members of the community burned the house that had sold the adulterated alcohol; no one was inside at the time. The alcohol caused 18 deaths in Axochiapan and 11 others in nearby municipalities. The state office of DIF sent food and water to vulnerable groups of people in eight municipalities including Axochiapan on May 26.

== Connections to the Mexican Revolution ==
Axochiapan was not untouched during the Mexican Revolution. Members from the Liberation Army of the South such as Alejandro Casales, Joaquín Caamaño, Marcelino Rodríguez, Marcelino Vergara, Benigno Abundes, and José Palma had connections to the city.

General Alejandro Casales was one of the most important leaders during the Mexican Revolution. He fought in rebel operations in Morelos and helped organize peasant resistance. On March 11, 1911, peasants in Morelos took up arms in Ayala. Directed by Pablo Torres Burgos, they headed south to take Tlalquiltenango and Jojutla. When Burgos failed to control his men, he resigned from their command. After he left, he was captured and executed by his enemies. This left Casales to organize the soldiers. Soon, forces under the command of Morelos Cuernavaca and the 18th regiment under the control of Colonel Javier Rojas began to search for Casales. It wasn&#x27;t long before the 18th Regiment found Casales. He fought heroically all day until he was finally caught and burned alive. However, he had left Axochiapan organized to be the background for a new municipality.

General &quot;José Palma&quot; was born in Axochiapan; in 1911 he joined the Zapatista movement. He fell in battle, and his body was never found.

General &quot;Marcelino Rodríguez&quot; was from San Pablo Hidalgo in Tlaltizapán. He acted with military forces inside the borders of Morelos. He was an officer under the orders of General Francisco Mendoza, acting as the head of his escorts and later as the colonel of his own guerrilla group.

General &quot;Benigno Abundes&quot; was from Axochiapan. He fought under the orders of General Lorenzo Vázquez. On August 30, 1911, when Emiliano Zapata broke with the group, Abundes took control of his troops. He continued battling in &quot;Tilzapotla, Los Hornos, Nexpa, Quetzalpa, Chaucingo&quot;. and &quot;San Miguel&quot; in the state of Guerrero.

&quot;Joaquín Camaño Pérez&quot; was born in Axochiapan in 1887. Joaquín was the son of Martín Camaño and Petra García Sánchez. He began fighting at a very young age because he was angered by injustice. His scope included Jonacatepec to Chietla in the state of Puebla. He united with General Francisco Mendoza&#x27;s forces and was in the contingent that accompanied the General Emiliano Zapata in Chinameca where he was assassinated.

<text>Bernard James Freeman (born March 19, 1973), known professionally as Bun B, is an American rapper. He is best known as one half of the southern rap duo UGK (UnderGround Kingz), a group he formed in 1987 alongside Pimp C. Aside from his work with UGK, Bun B has released five solo albums, including 2010&#x27;s &quot;Trill OG&quot;, which received the rare 5-mic rating from &quot;The Source&quot;.

He is also a guest lecturer at Rice University, located in Houston, Texas.

==Life and career==

===UGK===

In the late 1980s, Pimp C started the rap duo UGK. He first released a demo tape titled &quot;Underground King&quot; which didn&#x27;t feature Bun B on the track. Instead, it featured Pimp C&#x27;s friend Mitchell Queen. Bun B and friend Jalon Jackson had their own group called P.A. Militia. Both groups joined forces and formed the group 4 Black Ministers. Queen and Jackson later left the group leaving Pimp C and Bun B so they decided to revert to UGK. The demo Pimp C recorded with Mitchell Queen, &quot;Underground King&quot;, caught the attention of an independent label in Houston called Bigtyme Records. They then released an extended play titled &quot;The Southern Way&quot;. The release of this record caught the attention of Jive Records. While recording their debut album, &quot;Too Hard to Swallow&quot;, many of the songs had content too explicit for the album, so Bigtyme Records released an extended play titled &quot;Banned&quot; before the album was released, including all the songs that were too explicit for &quot;Too Hard to Swallow&quot;. The song &quot;Pocket Full of Stones&quot; became the first UGK song to get major airplay throughout the United States. Their second album, &quot;Super Tight...&quot;, followed in 1994. Their third album, &quot;Ridin&#x27; Dirty&quot;, peaked at number 2 on the R&amp;B Charts in 1996, and at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After releasing their fourth studio album, &quot;Dirty Money&quot;, Pimp C got sentenced to jail.

===&quot;Trill&quot; and beginning of solo career===

When Bun B&#x27;s UGK partner, the late Chad &quot;Pimp C&quot; Butler, entered a jail sentence on an aggravated gun assault charge in 2002, Bun B made guest appearances on numerous albums by other rappers and released a 2005 mixtape titled &quot;Legends&quot;. Singles featuring a Bun B guest appearance included &quot;They Don&#x27;t Know&quot; by Paul Wall, &quot;Gimme That&quot; by Webbie and &quot;I&#x27;m A G&quot; by Yung Joc. Bun B also appeared in a documentary titled &quot;Screwed In Houston&quot; produced by VBS/&quot;Vice&quot; that details the history of the Houston rap scene.

In October 2005, Bun B&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Trill&quot; was released. Singles included &quot;Draped Up&quot;, &quot;Git It&quot;, and &quot;Get Throwed&quot;. The album peaked at the number 6 spot on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and number 1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart.

===&quot;II Trill&quot;===

After Pimp C died in 2007, Bun B returned to a solo career. In 2008, he released his second album, &quot;II Trill&quot;. The first single was &quot;That&#x27;s Gangsta&quot; featuring Jamaican American artist Sean Kingston. It debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200, selling 98,000 copies. Other singles were &quot;Damn I&#x27;m Cold&quot; featuring Lil Wayne and &quot;You&#x27;re Everything&quot; featuring Rick Ross, David Banner, DJ Corbett and 8Ball &amp; MJG, the latter of which was dedicated to the late Pimp C.

===&quot;Trill OG&quot;===
Bun B&#x27;s third album is &quot;Trill OG&quot;. In an interview with MTV Live, Bun B stated that 2Pac was set to feature on the album, claiming &quot;It&#x27;s a brand new verse.&quot; The album was released under Universal Music Group on August 3, 2010.

===&quot;Trill OG: The Epilogue&quot;===

On October 28, 2011, a song titled &quot;The Life&quot; and produced by 14KT was leaked. On March 3, 2012, Bun B leaked a song featuring Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; and Redman titled &quot;Stop Playin&#x27;&quot; after he reached 400,000 followers on Twitter. He has not announced the song&#x27;s appearance on his upcoming album

His fourth studio album was rumored to be titled, &quot;Trill 4 Life&quot; and scheduled for a 2013 release. On August 22, 2013, Rap-A-Lot Records revealed that his Sony distributed fourth studio album will be released in October 2013. The album is to feature guest appearances from Rick Ross and 2 Chainz. On October 4, 2013, the album was then officially announced to be titled &quot;Trill OG: The Epilogue&quot; and be released on November 12, 2013. The album was revealed to contain primarily leftover tracks from the &quot;Trill O.G.&quot; recording sessions. It was also confirmed to feature Pimp C, 2 Chainz, Rick Ross, Lil Boosie, Kirko Bangz, Big K.R.I.T., Raekwon, Z-Ro and Devin The Dude.

Bun B announced &quot;The Trillest Tour&quot; in January 2014. On January 30, the Houston native revealed the tour dates, where he was accompanied by fellow Houston native Kirko Bangz. The tour ran from March 6 until April 17, 2014.

==Other ventures==
===Awards===
On June 24, 2014, Bun B made a guest appearance to the Htown Beatdown concert hosted by local radio station Hot 95.7. He was awarded the 360 Legend Award for his successful music career and his impact on the local community.

===Teaching===
At the start of the Spring 2011 semester, Bun B joined the faculty of Rice University as a Distinguished Lecturer. He taught a course in the School of the Humanities on Hip hop and Religion. Into 2013 Bun B continues to teach the course twice a week.

===Coloring book===
On September 17, 2013, Freeman released a coloring book titled &quot;Bun B&#x27;s Rap Coloring Book&quot; along with author Shea Serrano. Freeman and Serrano had previously talked about working together to make a book. At first they agreed on a &quot;hip hop survival guide&quot;, but both agreed against the project. Later on, Serrano drew coloring pages of rappers that he posted on Tumblr. The pages quickly went viral. Freeman and Serrano then decided to make a whole coloring book.

===Trill Burgers===
Bun B opened up Trill Burgers located on South Shepherd and Richmond Avenue in Houston, Texas.

==Personal life==
Bun B has been married to Angela &quot;Queenie&quot; Wells since 2003 and has two stepchildren and seven step-grandchildren. His stepson is American rapper Young-B, who is a member of the rap group Youngest N Charge, which is Bun B&#x27;s opening act.

On April 24, 2019, Bun B shot an armed intruder who was attempting to rob his Houston home. The intruder fled on foot. The suspect, DeMonte Jackson, was taken into custody by Houston police after arriving at the hospital.

<doc id="731996" wikidata="Q1094341" url="?curid=731996" title="Ciudad Ayala">
<text>Ciudad Ayala is a city in the east-central part of the Mexican state of Morelos. It is named for Coronel Francisco Ayala who fought with José María Morelos during the 1812 Siege of Cuautla. The town&#x27;s previous name was &quot;Mapachtlan&quot;. Ayala became a municipality on April 17, 1869.

Ciudad Ayala had a population of 6,190 inhabitants in 2005, and 6335 in 2020. The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of Ayala, had a population of 85,521 inhabitants in 2015 and it has an area of and 89,834 in 2020. The municipality includes towns &quot;San Pedro Apatlaco&quot;, &quot;Anenecuilco&quot;, and &quot;Tenextepango&quot;, which are all larger than Ciudad Ayala. The city was previously known as &quot;San Francisco Mapachtlan&quot; but was renamed in 1868 to honor Francisco Ayala (1760–1812), who was the first leader in the modern state of Morelos to join the Cry of Dolores in 1810.

The town of Anenecuilco, birthplace of Emiliano Zapata, is within this municipality; as is the &quot;Hacienda de San Juan&quot;, near the town of Chinameca, where he was betrayed and assassinated. Ayala itself is best known for giving the name to Emiliano Zapata&#x27;s manifesto: the Plan of Ayala.

==History==
Prehispanic ruins at &quot;Olintepec&quot; date back to 1500 BCE, where they reached their peak between 1200 and 1610 CE. The people of Olintepec were Tlahuicas. Other ruins have been found at Tlayecac.

In 1603 Don &quot;Nicolas Abad&quot; built the hacienda of &quot;San Francisco Mapachtlan&quot; in 1603. Twelve years later this was elevated to a &quot;congregación.&quot; In 1750, supported by Dominican friars, the people built their own church, called &quot;San José de Mapachtlan.&quot; This was dependent upon Cuautla, Morelos, (formally called &quot;Cuautla de Ampilas&quot;) and in 1834 it became a &quot;pueblo.&quot; In 1868 it became a &quot;municipalidad&quot; of the State of Mexico, district of Cuernavaca, and changed its name to &quot;Villa de Ayala&quot; in honor of Francisco Ayala, a leader of the Mexican War of Independence. Ayala became a &quot;Centro de Poblacion&quot; (Population Center) on March 17, 1976.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020, and five cases were reported in Ayala. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. The municipal president, Isaac Pimentel Mejía, led an effort to distribute 10,000 food baskets to families in remote areas of the municipality. On June 2, Ayala reported 44 confirmed cases and five deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Ayala reported 264 cases, 205 recuperations, and 34 deaths as of August 31. There were 373 cases reported on December 27, 2020.

<text>Grantley Jonathan Nicholas (born 12 November 1967) is a Welsh musician and the lead singer and guitarist of the rock band Feeder. 

In 2014, Nicholas released his debut solo album &quot;Yorktown Heights.&quot; In the following year, a released a mini-album titled &quot;Black Clouds&quot; .

Nicholas has won two Kerrang Awards for Best British Live Act 2001 and Best British Band 2003.

==Early years==
Nicholas was born in Newport, South Wales, but grew up in Pwllmeyric near Chepstow. He was educated at Monmouth School. He performed in public for the first time at the age of 11 at school, and gained four O-levels (the predecessor to GCSEs), including an A grade in Art.

In school, Nicholas played the trumpet, and joined his first band, Sweet Leaf (named after a song by Black Sabbath, who were his favourite band in his school years, and the first he saw play live, at the Colston Hall in Bristol). He was promised his first guitar by his parents, as an incentive to pass his exams. He received the guitar, an Aron Les Paul copy after passing them.

Grant says he did not like the &quot;cattle market&quot; aspects of school and didn&#x27;t work hard. His favourite bands at school included heavy metal bands such as Judas Priest and Black Sabbath.

== Guitars ==
Nicholas&#x27; &quot;signature guitar&quot; is a 1967 Sunburst Fender Jazzmaster. In addition to this, he also owns a 1964 Silver Jazzmaster (often tuned differently when used live) and another Sunburst 59 Jazzmaster. He is using Fender Telecasters more and more and has a 73 Sunburst Fender Telecaster a 63 Black Telecaster and a Blue Standard Telecaster.

His other guitars include a Cherry Red Gibson SG, a Fender Bellmaster, a Green Custom Jazzbird, a Green Jazzmaster (which he destroyed at Feeder&#x27;s headline set at Download 2005 and later said he regretted it, but still has the neck to make a new guitar with), a Gibson Firebird,a custom ESP &quot;Gibstang&quot;, a Sunburst Gibson J-200 Acoustic and a natural finish Yamaha acoustic (for recording). He uses a variety of different pedals and effects to produce the distinctive Feeder sound. His main amplifiers are: Vox AC30s, Fender Twins, Boogie and Marshall + Marshall and Orange Speaker Cabinets.

==Formative years==
After leaving school Nicholas worked as a hair dresser in Cardiff and then a bike courier in London. It was while in London that Nicholas learnt how to be a songwriter. When he was 19, he joined a progressive rock band called Multi-Story as their singer. He released one album with the band called &quot;Through Your Eyes&quot; and they disbanded soon after. The album was not given any backing by FM Records, due to internal problems during and after recording. Original singer Paul Ford left, leading to Nicholas being recruited from local band Silent Partner: the latter re-recorded the previously laid-down vocals, while re-writing some lyrics to suit his style. It was the band&#x27;s second and final album. After Multi-Story broke up, Nicholas joined Welsh nine-piece Temper Temper, where he met future Feeder drummer, Jon Lee. During these years. Nicholas found influence in alternative rock bands such as Nirvana, the Eels, Dinosaur Jr and Foo Fighters. He also enjoys movies such as &quot;Angel Heart&quot; and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;.

== Feeder ==

The band were formed whilst Nicholas was a producer, before moving to London to gain more experience. He had already met Jon Lee in Newport who moved down afterwards. They formed an electric/acoustic rock band named Raindancer, who despite winning a TV slot never gained a record deal. This saw bassist John Canham part ways with the band, before Simon Blight followed soon after when they reformed as Hum, which was changed to Reel, before then changing their name once again to Real in 1994 with their final name of Feeder being decided on that same year. A series of Reel recordings surfaced on eBay in early 2006. The band signed to The Echo Label in November of that year still under the name of Real, when this was changed to Feeder shortly afterwards, with London-based graphic designer Taka Hirose taking over bass duties in 1995. A year later in 1996, their debut single proper &quot;Stereo World&quot; reached number 128 in the UK charts during October 1996, while the second single &quot;Tangerine&quot; reached number 60. The first full-length album, &quot;Polythene&quot;, was released in May 1997. Produced by Chris Sheldon, it charted at number 65 in the UK and was certified Silver for sales over 60,000 copies in 2003 when the band had already broken through (then upgraded to Gold status for 100,000 copies in 2017). &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine included it in its Top 20 Albums of 1997 list at number 1.

The follow-up album, &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot;, was produced by Nicholas. Released in August 1999, the album was a much quicker commercial success than its predecessor (entering the UK album chart at number 8 and certified Silver in 2001, with this being upgraded to Gold in 2003). The title track was the band&#x27;s first UK Top 20 hit.

Two years later, the band released their third and also breakthrough album, &quot;Echo Park&quot;. Produced by Gil Norton (Foo Fighters, Pixies, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and James), the album peaked at number 5 in the UK and was also certified Gold, but in its release year, before going Platinum in 2003. It contained their first Top 10 single &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;.

In 2002, drummer Jon Lee took his own life, which saw the band keep out of the public eye, until their fourth album &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; was nearing its completion. The first play of its lead single &quot;Come Back Around&quot; on the Radio 1 &quot;The Evening Session&quot; show, was the first time since Jon&#x27;s death that the band made any public appearance and released new material, while a few days before this Grant was interviewed on the station, in which he spoke of their first shows without Jon. The single charted at No. 14, while the follow-up &quot;Just the Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot; made the Top 10, both singles appeared on &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot;, also produced by Norton, which although charting one place lower than &quot;Echo Park&quot;, became their first Platinum seller. The album featured Mark Richardson of Skunk Anansie on drums, before he parted company with Feeder in 2009, to return to a reformed Skunk Anansie.

Follow-up &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot; in 2005 (also produced by Norton) was not as successful, although it did not go Platinum, it still went Gold and charted at number 2 while also containing their third Top 10 and second top five single &quot;Tumble and Fall&quot;, and the more notable &quot;Feeling a Moment&quot;. 2006 saw their singles compilation, also chart at number 2 and achieve Platinum status. To date this is the last Feeder album to go Top 5 or be certified, although their next four albums &quot;Silent Cry&quot;, &quot;Renegades&quot;, &quot;Generation Freakshow&quot; and &quot;All Bright Electric&quot; all charted in the Top 20. All of these were produced by Nicholas, although Chris Sheldon also produced &quot;Generation Freakshow&quot;.

After 25 years since forming, Feeder were inducted into the &quot;Kerrang! Radio Hall of Fame&quot; on 9 August 2019, for &quot;Distinguished Services to Rock&quot;.

== Solo career ==
In early 2014, Grant Nicholas announced that he was recording a solo album. The song &quot;Soul Mates&quot; premiered on the Dermot O&#x27;Leary show on Radio 2 on Saturday 31 May. The same track was made available for a limited time as a free download.

His debut solo album &quot;Yorktown Heights&quot; was released on 11 August 2014, via Popping Candy, although in Japan it was released a few months earlier on Victor. &quot;Yorktown Heights&quot; was produced, written and played by Grant in his North London Treehouse Studio, The Crypt (London) and Angelic Studios in Banbury. Help at the controls came from Sam Miller &amp; Brian Sperber at his Ansons Pocket Studio in Yorktown Heights, upstate New York.

The idea to record a solo album, came about after Feeder&#x27;s gig at the Brixton Academy in late 2012. During this time Grant decided after 20 years without any time off, give Feeder a break for a short time while deciding to use the time to record and promote a solo album. After shows in July and June 2014 at The Slaughtered Lamb and Sebright Arms in London, &quot;Yorktown Heights&quot; charted at #29 on the UK album charts, which was seen as a success due to a lack of promotion from mainstream and alternative radio, while reviews mainly came from lesser known sources.

After the release of the album, Grant continued to tour and played the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan along the way. After ending 2014 with a show at the Islington Assembly Hall, Grant announced that due to the success of the album and supporting tour, alongside how much he&#x27;s enjoyed the experience, more solo shows were announced for 2015.

After the 2015 tour, a mini-album titled &quot;Black Clouds&quot; was released before the &quot;Everyday Society&quot; single was released for Record Store Day, bringing Grant&#x27;s solo career to a close. Feeder later resumed activity with their 2016 album &quot;All Bright Electric&quot;, and the 2017 compilation album &quot;The Best of Feeder&quot; which included new material on the bonus album &quot;Arrow&quot;. Both albums featured tracks originally intended for the solo album, but were re-recorded for Feeder (&quot;Slint&quot; and &quot;Veins&quot;, which maintains the original vocal track). Some have yet to see the light of day, being &quot;Rats&quot; and &quot;The Wall&#x27;s Around Us&quot;.

Grant would later close down Popping Candy and Big Teeth Music, before closing down his solo career website and Twitter handle.

== Personal life ==
Nicholas has a Japanese wife named Kana. They had their first child, a girl named Hanna Sky, in 2005 and their second child, a boy named Ko Marley, in 2007. They live together in Crouch End, London. He is also follower of football and supports Arsenal F.C. although he also once admitted he does not follow the sport as much as his bandmates. He does, however, consider himself an &quot;old school&quot; gamer.

== Other work ==
Nicholas remixed the track &quot;Ya Don&#x27;t See The Signs&quot; by the now defunct rap group Mark B and Blade, who had released the original version as their first single. Nicholas gave the rap track a rock guitar backing different from the original&#x27;s hip hop sound. This was added as an extra track to their 2000 album, &quot;The Unknown&quot;. This version came to the fore when used for the opening credits of Sky Sports Saturday Morning show, &quot;Soccer AM&quot;. In 2001 the new version, subtitled the &quot;Grant Nicholas Remix&quot;, was released as a single and reached No. 23 in the United Kingdom.

Nicholas spent the last few weeks of 2006 co-producing rock band EnjoyDestroy&#x27;s debut album with Brian Sperber, who later split. He was featured on an episode of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in 2008, his second appearance on the show after making his debut in 1999. In 2003 Nicholas sang on &quot;Broken&quot;, a &quot;Junkie XL&quot; song from his album &quot;Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin&quot;.

== Awards ==

As a member of Feeder, Nicholas has won two Kerrang Awards in 2001 and 2003 for Best British Live Act and Best British Band in that order. Nicholas would later dedicate the latter to Jon Lee in which he said that particular award was the one he always wanted Feeder to win. Kerrang Radio would later in 2019 induct Feeder into their Hall of Fame for &quot;Distinguished Services to Rock&quot;. The award plaque is seen in his Treehouse Studio whenever he performs acoustic sessions.

== Popular culture ==
In a Christmas special of the UK gameshow &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;, which was broadcast on 21 December 2013, Nicholas was a &quot;Pointless answer&quot; in a Band Aid 20 round. In which contestants had to identify from the official photo, participants on the recording. All of the members of Snow Patrol were also pointless answers.

Nicholas appeared in an episode of &quot;Salvage Hunters: Classic Cars&quot;. The programme&#x27;s hosts renovated a Fiat 130 car in the hope of selling to classic car enthusiasts. Amongst a gathering of interested buyers, Nicholas can be seen as one of the crowd.

<text>Coatlán del Río is a town in the Mexican state of Morelos. It stands at ,
at a mean height of 1,010 metres above sea level.

&quot;Coatlán&quot; is a name of Nahuatl origin, meaning &quot;place of abundant snakes&quot;.

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality reported 9,768 inhabitants in the 2015 census and 10,520 in 2020. The town of Coatlán del Río had a population of 1,907 the same year.

==History==
The origin of Coatlán del Río dates from the pre-Hispanic era. This town was founded by Toltecs in the year 1509, who were on a pilgrimage from Malinalco, State of Mexico. At first, they settled what is historically known as &quot;Coatlán Viejo&quot; (Old Coatlan), where there are stone ruins of the walls of buildings.

Coatlán Viejo is located 5 kilometers south of the municipal seat, on the hill known as &quot;Las Paredes&quot; (the Walls). Later, they moved to the hill of &quot;Axoyochi&quot;, located 3 km to the east, where archaeological remains of carved stones, known as Momoxtles (mound of earth), were found. It is believed there is a pyramid that has not been discovered. 

Other ruins of a town have been found in &quot;San Rafael&quot;, on the banks of the Chalma River. The stone called &quot;Escudo&quot; (now in the Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca a.k.a. &quot;Museo Regional Cuauhnahuac&quot;) is a series of hieroglyphic and pictographic figures represent the history of the area. There is a similar stone on the civic plaza of Coatlán del Río. Other groups, such as the Aztecs and the Tlahuica, may have settled in this area. This town belonged to the religious and political center of Xochicalco, to then become part of the lordship of &quot;Cuauhnahuac&quot; (Cuernavaca), a tributary city of the Aztecs. 

In the Colonial Era (1521-1812), Coatlán del Río was given in &quot;encomienda&quot; (entrusted to) a conquistador named Juan Zermeño. In 1782, Zermeño&#x27;s family filed a lawsuit against the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca over control of the town church, &quot;San Gaspar&quot;, which had been built in the 16th century.

The current church of Coatlán del Río was founded in 1808, and the bells were added in 1809. There is also a church called &quot;Santos Reyes&quot; or &quot;Epifania del Señor&quot;, and the chapel of &quot;Dolores&quot;, also called &quot;el Calvario&quot;. 

Coatlán del Río was declared a municipality on May 22, 1862.

The old municipal presidency was located to the south of the civic square, where the elementary school &quot;Prof. Miguel Salinas&quot; is today. In 1939, city hall has been at the former home of General &quot;Pedro Saavedra Brito&quot; (d. 1935). The current city hall was built in 1957 by Colonel &quot;Ezequiel Cruz Ortiz&quot; (1890-1970).

Carlos Nieto Estrada, an independent candidate, was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the July 1, 2018 election.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020, two cases were reported in Coatlán del Río. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On June 2, Coatlán del Río reported five confirmed cases and one death from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Coatlán del Río reported 17 cases, 12 recuperations, and six deaths as of August 31. Twenty-five cases were reported on December 27,2020.

==Water Resources==
Federal government page in Spanish (Dec 19, 2018)

The municipality has important hydrological resources, which greatly benefit the regional economy and influence the climate, microclimates, and vegetation.

The most important river is the Chalma River, which source is in Chalma, State of Mexico. It crosses the municipality through Colonia Morelos, Cocoyotla; and Coatlán del Río. There are three dams: &quot;La Toma&quot; in Cocoyotla, and &quot;Apantle Chico&quot; and &quot;Cazahuatlánfrom&quot; in San Rafael. The &quot;Apantle Grande&quot; is derived from the Coatlán Dam; there is also another small dam in Cocoyotla, which is the source of the &quot;Agua Salada&quot;.

There are other low-flow streams such as the &quot;Cuates&quot;, the &quot;Cocoyotla&quot;, and the &quot;Axixintle&quot; that carry water throughout the year, and the &quot;Joyas&quot;, the &quot;Arenal&quot; and the &quot;Milpillas&quot;, which carry water only during the rainy season (May-November). There are also eight springs and seven wells.

<doc id="732005" wikidata="Q5524366" url="?curid=732005" title="Garth Marenghi">
<text>Garth Marenghi is a fictional horror author created by English comedian Matthew Holness. He is depicted as a conceited hack writer, who remains blissfully (or even wilfully) unaware of his lack of talent.

The character has appeared in two stage shows, the Perrier Award-nominated &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Fright Knight&quot; and Perrier Award-winning &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Netherhead&quot;, and the Channel 4 TV series &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot; and &quot;Man to Man with Dean Learner&quot;.

After winning the Perrier Award, the creators confounded media sources by refusing to speak out of character, or give real names or backgrounds.

==Character==
Garth Marenghi is a spoof pulp horror author; his act and his works are considered a parody of the horror genre. The name &quot;Garth Marenghi&quot; is an anagram of the phrase &quot;argh nightmare.&quot;

The character is highly conceited and narcissistic, often describing himself through epithets such as &quot;the dream weaver&quot;, &quot;shaman&quot;, &quot;titan of terror&quot;, &quot;The One Man Fear Factory&quot; and &quot;master of the macabre.&quot; In interviews, he compares himself positively with James Joyce, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Jesus.

Despite this, Marenghi displays a general ignorance of many subjects of which he claims knowledge. He claims to be self-taught, having left school young (&quot;I knew by the age of eight that my education had finished&quot;), and despite his claims to being a literary genius he rarely reads books. When he needs to learn about a subject, he will &quot;hire someone to go and find out about it.&quot; In both stage shows, in the official website, and in numerous interviews he claims to have written more books than he has read.

Marenghi displays other traits including sexism, xenophobia, and extreme paranoia. He is depicted as married with four daughters, though disappointed at not having a son. The &quot;Darkplace&quot; episode &quot;Skipper the Eye Child&quot; explains this, and references this in its plot with Marenghi&#x27;s character Rick Dagless shown as having a deceased son who was half boy, half grasshopper. During the DVD feature &#x27;Darkplace Illuminatum&#x27; Marenghi draws further comparisons with himself and Dagless. He comments &quot;In many ways he is an extension of my own natural abilities. He&#x27;s got a little more than me. He is a little more tragic than I am, as a character. He&#x27;s seen the dark side. A little too much.&quot;

== &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot; ==

The 2004 show &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot; is based on the premise that Garth Marenghi wrote and starred in a 1980s low-budget hospital-based horror show. Within this fictional context, 50 shows were created, but were never shown as they were suppressed by &quot;MI-8&quot; for being &quot;too subversive, too dangerous, too damn scary.&quot;

Many jokes are based on the premise that Garth Marenghi not only created and wrote the series, but also plays the central character. As such, characters reflect Marenghi&#x27;s world-view, and his own characterDoctor Rick Dagless, M.D.exhibits many characteristics of a Mary Sue.

==Other television appearances==
Marenghi also guests in the first episode of Dean Learner&#x27;s talk series, &quot;Man to Man with Dean Learner&quot;, where he reveals that he lost an ear in an ambulance crash, has written a total of 436 books, and has filmed a new movie, &quot;War of the Wasps&quot;, featuring most of the cast of &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot;. Marenghi has appeared in an episode of the &quot;Russell Howard Hour&quot; as part of a Christmas special to read a portion of one of his novels, &quot;Flay Bells Sting, Are You Glistening?&quot;

<text>Poundstretcher Limited is a British variety store chain, founded in 1981 by Paul Appell and Stephen Fearnley. The retailer is currently based in Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire, and since April 2024 has been a subsidiary of the Fortress Investment Group.

As of March 2023, the retailer has 324 locations and employs around 4,000 people, with 61 of its locations trading as Bargain Buys.

==History==
Poundstretcher was established in 1981 by Paul Appell and Stephen Fearnley. It became a subsidiary of Brown &amp; Jackson plc (originally a construction firm which can be traced back to 1923) in March 1989.

After selling Poundstretcher to Philip Harris, founders Paul Appell and Stephen Fearnley acquired control of a failing retail business, &quot;United News Shops&quot;, which they managed to revitalise. In March 2008, &quot;United News Shops&quot; was sold to WHSmith.

In 1995 Pepkor, South Africa&#x27;s largest retailer, acquired a controlling stake in Brown &amp; Jackson plc and refinanced it. Brown &amp; Jackson expanded rapidly with What Everyone Wants and Your More Stores purchased in October 1997 and The Brunswick Warehouse in January 2000. During 2000 the group continued to expand organically, including its first overseas venture with the opening of 6 stores in Poland.

During 2002 the group embarked on a major restructuring. The board undertook to dispose of the trading subsidiaries other than Poundstretcher Ltd and this disposal was completed on 27 September 2002. In 2003 the company undertook a rebrand of company name to Instore plc. Poundstretcher stores were gradually being rebranded to ...instore, however in 2006, a new chief executive concluded that the rebranding was not working, and from June 2009, new stores were opened as Poundstretcher after Instore plc was acquired by Aziz Tayub. In September 2012, the group had 400 stores in the United Kingdom.

In May 2011, the company bought Alworths. On 6 February 2012, Poundstretcher acquired 20 stores from the UGO chain, after it was placed in administration. In April 2012, Poundstretcher opened a store at Madina Mall, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the first outside the United Kingdom since the 2002 disposal of B&amp;J Poland. In September 2012, it was announced that out of the 20 stores that were acquired, 14 were to close, and the remaining 6 most profitable outlets would remain as part of the group.

In 2018, after Poundworld was shut down, Poundstretcher began to open former stores under the Bargain Buys brand name, which was previously used by the former company. The trademark for Bargain Buys was claimed by Poundstretcher.

In August 2018, Channel 4 broadcast &quot;Saving Poundstretcher&quot; which focused on former Poundworld owner Chris Edwards&#x27;s attempts to revitalise the chain. Edwards was dismissed from his role at the retailer by owner Aziz Tayub during the series, which attracted criticism from viewers.

In June 2020, the retailer explored the possibility of a company voluntary arrangement due to financial difficulties. It would achieve large profit increases in the following year.

In September 2023, the retailer began looking at acquiring Wilko locations, following the chain&#x27;s administration. In December, Tristan Phillips, the former head of finance at Marks &amp; Spencer, was promoted to be the retailer&#x27;s chief executive.

in April 2024, Aziz Tayub sold Poundstretcher to Fortress Investment Group.

<text>Grays Athletic Football Club is a football club based in Grays, Essex, England. They are currently members of the and play at Chadfields in nearby Tilbury.

==History==
The club was established as Grays Juniors in 1890, before merging with former Southern League club Grays United to form Grays Athletic. The newly formed club joined the Grays &amp; District League, later joining Division Two B of the South Essex League in 1908. They were runners-up in their first season in the division and won it in their second season, earning promotion to Division One for the 1909–10 season. The club were founder members of the Athenian League in 1912, but the league closed down in 1914 due to World War I and Grays transferred to the Premier Division (Amateur) of the London League. They won the division in their first season, with the reserves also winning Division One. The league was suspended at the end of the 1914–15 season, with Grays rejoining in the Premier Division when it restarted in 1919–20.

Grays were Premier Division runners-up in 1920–21, before winning the division in 1921–22. In 1924 the club joined the Kent League but after two seasons in mid-table, they returned to the London League in 1926. The return was a success as the club were Premier Division champions in 1926–27 and runners-up in the next two seasons, before winning the title again in 1929–30. After finishing as runners-up in 1930–31, the club spent most of the 1930s in mid-table, although they won the league&#x27;s Challenge Cup in 1936–37.

After World War II Grays were founder members of the Corinthian League, and were its inaugural champions and League Cup winners in 1945–46. They were league runners-up in 1951–52, and the following season saw them qualify for the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 5–0 at home to Llanelli. They were league runners-up again in 1954–55 and 1956–57, before rejoining the Athenian League in 1958. When the league gained two more divisions in 1963, the club were placed in the Premier Division, where they remained until being relegated to Division One at the end of the 1971–72 season, in which they had finished bottom of the table. In 1977 the league was reorganised into a single division, and the club were runners-up in 1982–83.

In 1983 Grays transferred to Division Two of the Isthmian League. League reorganisation saw them placed in Division Two South in 1984 and they went on to win the division at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One. In 1987–88 they were Division One runners-up, resulting in promotion to the Premier Division. In 1988–89 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup for a second time, losing 2–0 at Bath City. They remained in the Premier Division until being relegated back to Division One at the end of the 1996–97 season. In 1999–2000 the club were Division One runners-up, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. In 2000–01 another appearance in the FA Cup first round saw them play Football League opposition for the first time, losing 4–0 at Reading.

A sixth-place finish in 2003–04 resulted in Grays being placed in the new Conference South for the 2004–05 season. They went on to win the new division in its first season, earning promotion to the Conference National. The season also saw them reach the final of the FA Trophy, in which they beat Hucknall Town 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw at Villa Park. In their first season in the Conference National the club finished third, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they lost 5–4 on aggregate to Halifax Town. They also reached the second round of the FA Cup, beating York City 3–0 at Bootham Crescent before losing 3–0 at Mansfield Town, as well as retaining the FA Trophy with a 2–0 win over Woking in the final. The club&#x27;s league form subsequently faded and after narrowly avoiding relegation in 2006–07 and 2008–09, they finished bottom of the Conference National in 2009–10 and resigned from the Football Conference.

Grays were initially rejected by the Isthmian League and were lined up to play in the Essex Senior League. However, an appeal to the Football Association saw them placed in Division One North of the Isthmian League. A fifth-place finish in 2011–12 saw them qualify for the play-offs, in which Enfield Town defeated them 3–1 on penalties after a 2–2 draw in the semi-final. However, the club were Division One North champions the following season with a club record 102 points, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. In August 2016 the club became community-owned. They went on to finish bottom of the Premier Division in the 2016–17 and were relegated back to the (renamed) North Division. In 2022–23 the club finished fifth in the North Division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs, in which they lost 3–2 to AFC Sudbury in the semi-finals.

===Season-by-season===
==Ground==
The club initially played at the Hoppit Ground in Little Thurrock. In 1906 they moved to the New Recreation Ground, playing there until 2010. After the ground was sold to developers, the club groundshared with East Thurrock United at their Rookery Hill ground in Corringham.

During the 2012–13 season the club played at Rush Green Stadium in Rush Green, sharing the ground with West Ham United&#x27;s reserves who played in the Professional Development League. The following season, West Ham pulled out of the deal in June and Grays moved to Aveley&#x27;s Mill Field ground. When Aveley moved to Parkside in 2017, Grays became tenants at the new ground. In February 2023 Grays announced the club would be groundsharing at Tilbury for the 2023–24 season.

In 2024 the club obtained ownership of Ship Lane, the former home of Thurrock, stating they hoped to be playing at the new ground in the 2025–26 season.

<text>The Hornisgrinde, 1,164 m (3,820 ft), is the highest mountain in the Northern Black Forest of Germany. The Hornisgrinde lies in northern Ortenaukreis district.

== Origin of the name ==
The name is probably derived from Latin, and essentially translates to &quot;boggy head,&quot; referring to the raised bog (&quot;Hochmoor&quot;). Another interpretation of the name is derived from the terms &quot;Horn&quot;, &quot;miss&quot; and &quot;grind&quot; and meant the same as &quot;kahler Bergrücken&quot; (&quot;bald ridge&quot;), which carries a moorland on its height.

== Geography ==
The summit of the Hornisgrinde is framed of the Muhrkopf (1003 m) near Unterstmatt in the north and the Mummelsee (1036 m) in the south. In the west the slope is cut through by the &quot;Schwarzwaldhochstraße&quot; (B 500) in approximately 900 to 1000 m, in the east drops the tendency steeply to the ice-age cirque &quot;Biberkessel&quot; with the landing Blindsee lake. The summit changes to the Katzenkopf mountain in the southwest at 1123 m, into the southeast drops the burr toward Seibelseckle. The Katzenkopf mountain and the southeast burr of the Hornisgrinde form the cirque of the Mummelsee.

=== &quot;Grinden&quot; and raised bogs ===

The &quot;Grinden&quot; - treeless wet heathlands on the highest areas, were created following forest clearance and the subsequent use of the land as grazing in the 15th century. By contrast the raised bog, up to five metres thick, in the southeastern area of the summit plateau is naturally treeless. It is reckoned to be at least 6,000 years old.

Parts of the plateau with the raised bog and the Karwand to the Biberkessel were designated as the Hornisgrinde-Biberkessel Nature Reserve (&quot;Naturschutzgebiet Hornisgrinde–Biberkessel&quot;, 95 ha.) in 1992.

== Climate ==
The Hornisgrinde belongs to the precipitation-richest places in Germany. The average yearly precipitation amounts to 1931 mm. Over 99% of the measuring points of the German weather service indicate lower values. The driest month is February; at most it rains in June. There&#x27;s 1.4 times more precipitation in the precipitation-richest month than in the driest one. The seasonal precipitation fluctuations lie in the upper third. In over 81% of all places the monthly precipitation varies less.

== History ==
=== Dreifürstenstein ===
The Dreifürstenstein is a sandstone plate, which is located at the southeast edge of the plateau. It originates from the year 1722 and marked the border between the Margraviate of Baden, the duchy Württemberg and the Diocese of Strasbourg. Today the point represents the boundary border between Baden&#x27;s municipalities Sasbach, Seebach and Württemberg&#x27;s municipality Baiersbronn. With a height of 1,151 m above sea level the Dreifürstenstein is the highest point of Württemberg.

=== Military use ===
In 1938 the entire southern range of the summit level was declared as the military restricted area. First being in use since 1942 by the German Forces as an air defense position, the French took over the location in 1945. These operated on the Hornisgrinde an observing station on behalf of the French foreign secret service DGSE. Later the location was used parallel also by the Bundeswehr and NATO. After the plant went out of operation in 1994, it lay fallow several years. The restricted area was released in 1997. In 1999 the neighbor municipalities took over the federal area. Some of the buildings and masts are preserved, however they&#x27;re purging more and more.

== Tourism ==
The long-distance footpath, the West Way runs across the ridge, and the Black Forest High Road runs over the western and southern sides of the mountain, with a large car park at the Mummelsee. From there an educational path with information boards by the Ruhestein nature conservation centre leads across the summit plateau, crossing the raised bog on a board walk.

=== Observation tower ===
At the southern end, above the Mummelsee, stands the 23-metre-high Hornisgrinde Tower. The construction of this observation tower in 1910 was an initiative by the Black Forest Club branch in Baden. New red sandstone was used as the building material. Together with the Mummelsee, the tower was one of the most popular destinations in the region at that time. In 1942 it was commandeered by the Luftwaffe. After World War II it was used by the French military. In 2000 the Seebach forestry association acquired the tower from the Federation and transferred it to the municipality of Seebach as a lease. On 29 May 2005 the tower was opened again to the public.

=== Signal tower ===
At the highest point of the mountain, in the midst of the summit level is a further tower, the 7 meters high signal tower established around 1840. In 1892 it was converted by assembly of stairs at the exterior into an observation tower. However, it was inaccessible during the military use of the summit. In 2000 the tower (also called Bismarck tower) was reorganized and made again accessible by a steel spiral stair lying outside.

== Winter sports ==

=== Alpine ===
There is no lift system to the top of the Hornisgrinde itself. However, north of the summit is the &quot;Skizirkus Unterstmatt&quot;, with two lifts at the north slope of the Muhrkopf. To the south is the nearby ski lift of Seibelseckle.

=== Cross-country skiing ===
Around the summit of the Hornisgrinde leads a 14 km long &quot;loipe&quot; consisting of the Mummelseeloipe (6 km), Hundsrückenloipe (4.5 km) and the Ochsenstall-Seibelseckle &quot;loipe&quot; (3.5 km). It is prepared for classical and skating technology. Entrance possibilities are at the Mummelsee, at the col Seibelseckle and at the col Unterstmatt.

== Technical plants ==
* Due to the high average wind speed of 5.2 m/s in the annual average on the Hornisgrinde in the mid-1990s a commercial wind park was established. In 1994 two wind-power plants of 110 KW each one were built in private initiative, a third one with 132 KW followed in 1996. Like on other places there are controversial discusses the exposed location.
* Also on top of the Hornisgrinde is a 206 m (676 ft) high radio tower of the Südwestrundfunk, transmitting radio and television programmes. The tower is not open to the public.
* At the northern end of the summit plateau is a transmitting tower of the German Telekom AG. It accommodates a relay station for amateur television. Until 2005 also the program of the Deutschlandfunk was radiated by this tower, later the transmitter was shifted to the higher and thus far handing SWR tower. Also this tower is not accessible for the public.

<text>Sprinkles are small pieces of confectionery used as an often colorful decoration or to add texture to desserts such as brownies, cupcakes, doughnuts or ice cream. The tiny candies are produced in a variety of colors and are generally used as a topping or a decorative element. The &quot;Dictionary of American Regional English&quot; defines them as &quot;tiny balls or rod-shaped bits of candy used as a topping for ice-cream, cakes and other.&quot;

==Names==
In the UK and other Anglophonic Commonwealth countries sprinkles are denoted by different signifiers. For example, hundreds and thousands is the most popular denotation used in United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to refer to nonpareils, a type of sprinkles. Another UK variant of the term is vermicelli, especially when said of chocolate sprinkles. This name can be seen borrowed into spoken Egyptian Arabic as &quot;faːrmasil&quot;.

Jimmies is the most popular term for chocolate sprinkles in the Boston, Philadelphia, and New England regions.
The origin of the name &quot;jimmies&quot; is uncertain, but it was first documented in 1930, as a topping for cake. The Just Born Candy Company of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, claims to have invented jimmies and named them after an employee.

An unlikely claim on the name &quot;jimmies&quot; originates from Dr. Sidney Farber and Edward Brigham. Dr. Farber co-founded the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, as well as a charity, The Jimmy Fund, named after one of his child patients. Brigham opened an ice cream restaurant called Brigham&#x27;s and charged an extra penny for chocolate sprinkles on a cone, which benefited The Jimmy Fund. The fund however, was started in 1948, well after the first historical reference.

In Connecticut and other places in the U.S., as indicated by including the sense in the official Merriam-Webster, shots is a specific term for sprinkles.

==History==
Nonpareils date back at least to the late 18th century, if not earlier. They were used as decoration for pièces montées and desserts.

Dutch &quot;hagelslag&quot; (chocolate sprinkles) were invented in 1913 by Erven H. de Jong from Wormerveer. Venz, another Dutch company, made &quot;hagelslag&quot; popular. &quot;Hagelslag&quot; is used on bread and other things made of bread. Most of the time butter is spread out so the &quot;hagelslag&quot; does not fall off. After much research and venture, Gerard de Vries and Venz created the first machine to produce the tiny cylindrical treats. They were named &quot;hagelslag&quot; after their resemblance to a weather phenomenon prominent in the Netherlands: hail. (This reference is also transferred to the Finnish word for sprinkles, &quot;Koristerakeet&quot; which literally means &quot;decorative hail&quot;). Only &quot;hagelslag&quot; with a cacao percentage of more than 32% can bear the name &quot;chocoladehagelslag&quot; (chocolate sprinkles). If it is lower than 32%, it is to be referred to as &quot;cacaofantasie&quot; or &quot;cacaofantasie hagelslag&quot; (cacao fantasy sprinkles).

The American candy company Just Born cites its founder, Sam Born, as inventing the &quot;chocolate&quot; sprinkles called &quot;jimmies&quot; (which might never have contained any chocolate) in Brooklyn, New York. However, advertisements for chocolate sprinkles as a confection exist in the United States as far back as 1921, predating Just Born by two years.

A related product, sanding sugar has been commercially available in a small range of colors for decades. Now it comes in a wide variety, including black and metallic-like &quot;glitter&quot;.

==Types==

Popular terminology for this confection tends to overlap, while manufacturers are more precise with their labeling. What consumers often call &quot;sprinkles&quot; covers several types of candy decorations that are &quot;sprinkled&quot; randomly over a surface, as opposed to decorations that are placed in specific spots. Nonpareils (hundreds-and-thousands), confetti, silver, gold, and pearl dragées, pearl sugar and &quot;sugar shapes&quot; (sequins) are all used this way. 

&quot;Sanding sugar&quot; is a transparent crystal sugar of larger size than general-use refined white sugar. &quot;Crystal sugar&quot; tends to be clear and of much larger crystals than sanding sugar. &quot;Pearl sugar&quot; is relatively large, opaque white spheroids of sugar. Both crystal and pearl sugars are typically used for sprinkling on sweet breads, pastries, and cookies in many countries.

Some American manufacturers deem the elongated opaque sprinkles the official sprinkles. In British English, these are &quot;sugar strands&quot;. In the New England region of United States, as well as in Philadelphia, sprinkles are often referred to as jimmies. &quot;Jimmies&quot;, in this sense, are usually considered to be used as an ice cream topping, while sprinkles are for decorating baked goods, but the term can be used for both.

The sprinkles known as &quot;nonpareils&quot; in French are tiny opaque spheres that were traditionally white, but that now come in many colors; in Commonwealth countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, these are known as &quot;hundreds and thousands&quot;. 

The sprinkle-type of &quot;dragée&quot; (also known as a &quot;cachou&quot;) is like a large nonpareil with a metallic coating of silver, gold, copper, or bronze. The food-sprinkle dragée is now also made in a form resembling pearls.

&quot;Sugar shapes&quot; (&quot;sequins&quot;) are a newer product which come in a variety of shapes, often flavored, for holidays or themes, such as Halloween witches and pumpkins, or flowers and dinosaurs. Candy cane shapes may taste like peppermint, and gingerbread men like gingerbread cookies.

Toppings that are more similar in consistency to another type of candy, even if used similarly to sprinkles, are usually known by a variation of that candy&#x27;s name—for example, mini-chocolate chips or praline.

==Uses==
Sprinkles generally require frosting, ice cream, or some other sort of sticky material in order to stick to the desired food surface. They can be most commonly found on smaller confections such as cupcakes or frosted sugar cookies, as these generally have more frosting and smaller diameter than do cakes.

In the Netherlands, &quot;chocoladehagelslag&quot; (chocolate sprinkles) is used as a sandwich topping (similar to muisjes and vlokken); this is also common in Belgium and the former colonies of the Netherlands, Suriname and Indonesia. These countries also use &quot;vruchtenhagel&quot; and &quot;anijshagel&quot; (made of sugar and fruit/anise-flavour respectively) on sandwiches (mainly at breakfast). In Indonesia, it is commonly known as &quot;meses&quot; or &quot;meises&quot;, presumably derived from the Dutch &quot;muisjes&quot;, which are also similar. In Belgium it is often called &quot;muizenstrontjes&quot; (mouse droppings), due to the resemblance.

Fairy bread is the name given to the children&#x27;s treat of nonpareils (&quot;hundreds and thousands&quot;) on buttered white bread. Fairy bread is commonly served at children&#x27;s parties in Australia and New Zealand.

A dessert called confetti cake has sprinkles mixed with the batter, where they slowly dissolve and form little colored spots, giving the appearance of confetti. Confetti cakes are popular for children&#x27;s birthdays in the United States. The Pillsbury Company sells its own variation known as &quot;Funfetti&quot; cake, incorporating a sprinkle-like substance into the mix.

<text>Boglins were a series of toy puppets distributed by Mattel. They were created by Tim Clarke, Maureen Trotto, and Larry Mass, and licensed by Seven Towns. The original run of Boglins was released in 1987, coinciding with a &quot;creatures&quot; craze that included Ghoulies, Critters, and Gremlins. Boglins were goblin-themed hand puppets made of flexible rubber and could be manipulated to represent speech and facial expressions. Several series of large and small Boglins were released until 1994, with additional aquatic, Halloween, and baby themed Boglins released later into the line. Small solid &#x27;Mini-Boglins&#x27; were also produced, akin to the Kinkeshi figures also from the 1980s.

==Original Boglins toys==

Created by Jim Henson Company alumni Tim Clarke, Maureen Trotto and Larry Mass for the Seven Towns company in 1987, Boglins were initially brought to Coleco as a potential addition to their Sectaurs line; but were eventually marketed on their own by Mattel in 1987. The three original large scale Boglins were Dwork, Vlobb and Drool (Vlobb and Drool were called Plunk and Flurp in the UK), and were packaged in unique wooden crate-like boxes with bent plastic jail-bars. Although sporting small arms and a tail, these puppets mostly consisted of a large goblin-like head, drawing some inspiration from the giant Olmec heads of Ancient Mexico. Constructed from an artificial rubber known as Kraton, the initial models also featured glow in the dark eyes, which could be moved using a lever hidden inside the puppets, as well as the ability to wink/blink via a small plastic tab above each eye. Unlike many toylines of the 1980s there was no accompanying cartoon series or comic book for Boglins, with a backstory only mentioned in the &quot;Bogologist Field Notes&quot; on the back of the packaging. The notes establish the science of &quot;Bogology&quot;, detailing how the creatures originated from a &quot;swampy bog that time forgot&quot;, possibly a &quot;missing link&quot; to human personalities. The first release of large creatures were given the species name &quot;Boglinus Humungus&quot;.

Smaller Boglins (a subspecies known as &quot;Boglinus minimus&quot;), named Squidge, Shlump, Shlurp, Sponk, Squawk, and Squeel were also early releases into the line (in the UK these names were changed to Squit, Boink, Splatt, Blap, Klang, and Doink respectively). Lasting only two years in the United States, Boglins proved to be a bigger hit within the United Kingdom, distributed by the toy companies Ideal and Action GT. Other later Boglins included &quot;Talking Boglins&quot; (Glint and Kwirk), Aquatic-themed &quot;Soggy Boglins&quot; (Snish the Fish, Slogg the Frog, and Slobster the Lobster), &quot;Halloween Boglins&quot; (Blobkin and Bog o&#x27; Bones), &quot;Glow Boglins&quot; (Klang, Doink, and Squit), &quot;Action Boglins&quot; (Rasp, Gunge, Likk, Iball, and Spit), &quot;Bash&#x27;em Boglins&quot; (Splat and Skwish), and re-releases of the original larger Boglins: Dwork, Flurp, and Plunk, now including hair and &quot;wiggly tongues&quot;. &quot;Baby Boglins&quot; were also produced, much smaller in size serving more as finger puppets as opposed to the full-sized hand puppets. These came inside of small plastic eggs and included Blap, Boink, Squit, Klang, Doink, Splat, Cratch, Flop, Lurp, Mork, Snot, and Suk; Boink, Klang, and Squit also came in &quot;Baby Action Boglins&quot; variants. Other variations included small hard-plastic &quot;Caged&quot; Boglins, as well as &quot;Acrobat Boglins&quot; made from a sticky elastomer similar to the octopus-shaped Wacky WallWalkers of the same era.

==Mini Boglins==

Mini Boglins were first released in 1991 by Ideal. They were solid PVC with no movable parts (similar to Monster in My Pocket and M.U.S.C.L.E.), and were sold in randomized blister packs of 3, 5, 10, or 20 figures. With over 100 distinct figures of varying color-schemes, Mini Boglins were usable in a Boglins-themed game, that assigned various ranks to the figures, and divided them into 12 different tribes. Many models featured &quot;secret battle code symbols&quot; with in-game utility that would appear after it was heated and left to cool. There were also &quot;Slime Boglins&quot; that were Mini Boglins sold in plastic toilets filled with toy slime, a Mini Boglins Swamp carry case that unfolded to resemble a small landscape, a mail-away Mini Boglins cage and an additional 13th Mini Boglins tribe, &quot;The Cool Dudes&quot;, only released in packages of Kellog&#x27;s Frosties in the UK.

==Re-released Boglins==

Mattel rejuvenated the Boglins line in 2000 through Lansay, Awesome Toys and Vivid Imagination with two new series of puppets: large, electronic ones that talked, and several smaller ones that stuck out their tongues or spat water when squeezed. In 2016 there was a Boglin art show in New York by Clutter Arts featuring a Boglin mold painted by multiple artists. Boglins would make a return in 2017 under a licensing deal with Seven Towns and Clutter Magazine in limited run batches to the collector&#x27;s market. In August 2022, there is an expected release of the Bat Boglins and King Sponk series, with a limited edition TheBoglins.com online exclusive Bat Boglin Orlock, which will be autographed and numbered by creator Tim Clarke. Pre-orders are now open. Clarke has made recent appearances at collector&#x27;s conventions and other special events to promote and autograph Boglins.

<text>Girl Genius is an ongoing comic book series turned webcomic, written and drawn by Phil and Kaja Foglio and published by their company Studio Foglio LLC under the imprint Airship Entertainment. The comic won the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story three times, has been nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist and twice for Eisner Awards, and won multiple WCCA awards.

&quot;Girl Genius&quot; has the tagline of &quot;Adventure, Romance, Mad Science!&quot;. It follows the main character Agatha Heterodyne (introduced in 1995) through an alternate-history Victorian-style &quot;steampunk&quot; setting, although elements veer from what is usually thought of as steampunk. Kaja Foglio describes it as &quot;gaslamp fantasy&quot; instead to suggest its more fantastic style.

As well as the comics, the Foglios have also written four Girl Genius novels, all published by Night Shade Books, and two games based on the world have been made.

==Overview==
===Setting===
The setting has been described as steampunk, with reviewers for &quot;Wired&quot; describing it as a &quot;mosh of Victorian era, magic and emerging technology&quot; and &quot;steampunk to the core&quot;, but co-creator Kaja Foglio dislikes the term and instead coined the term &quot;gaslamp fantasy&quot; to describe the work. Kaja said in a blog post that when &quot;Girl Genius&quot; was first coming out, there was a comic called &quot;Steampunk&quot; and she wanted to avoid confusion. She added that &quot;we have no punk, and we have more than just steam, [so] using a different name seemed appropriate.&quot; &quot;Girl Genius&quot; differs from classic steampunk in that technology is not just limited to machines but also encompasses biology such as &quot;constructs&quot; – biological creations which range from Frankenstein-style creatures to talking cats and mouse-sized mammoths.

&quot;Girl Genius&quot; is set in an alternate-universe Europe with Industrial Revolution-like surroundings, airships, and mad scientists called Sparks. These Sparks, who have incredible powers of invention, turned the Age of Enlightenment into a full-scale war that ravaged the continent, until Baron Wulfenbach brought an uneasy peace through force.

=== Plot ===
&quot;Girl Genius&quot; tells the story of Agatha Clay, a student and apprentice at Transylvania Polygnostic University, whose experiments never work until she encounters an electromagnetic pulse and is robbed of her locket. This leads her to break free of an attempt to suppress her powers as a Spark and to hide that she is the long-lost daughter of legendary figures William &quot;Bill&quot; Heterodyne and Lucrezia Mongfish, and thus is the last of the prestigious and dreaded House of Heterodyne. Agatha Heterodyne learns to mix scientific genius, a streak of heroism, and an obsessive possessiveness for what she considers her own in order to claim her heritage and birthright while trying to remain safe from the many European powers trying to use her for their own ends.

==Major characters==
The main and recurring characters of &quot;Girl Genius&quot; include:
*Agatha Heterodyne: She was raised under the name of Agatha Clay and was kept ignorant of her true identity growing up. It is when her locket is stolen that Agatha &quot;breaks through&quot; as a Spark, leading her to learn that she is the last of the Heterodyne family. She spends the story trying to reclaim her family heritage and defend it from the many threats to its safety.
*The Heterodyne Boys: Two legendary brothers and heroes, Bill and Barry Heterodyne, who are Agatha&#x27;s father and uncle respectively. Bill&#x27;s wife Lucrezia Mongfish went missing one day, prompting the Heterodyne Boys to fight in a war from which they became missing in action.
*The Other: A malevolent, enigmatic entity who almost destroyed Europa twenty years before the story&#x27;s start, and whom the Heterodyne Boys went missing when going off to fight. Over the course of the story, Agatha comes to believe that the Other was Lucrezia Mongfish, her long-lost mother.
*Baron Klaus Wulfenbach: A pan-European leader. Klaus was once a sidekick of the Heterodyne Boys, but when they disappeared, he chose to bring peace to Europe through force. He suspects Agatha Heterodyne to be the Other.
*Gilgamesh &quot;Gil&quot; Wulfenbach: The only son of Klaus Wulfenbach, who is raising him as a successor, and one of Agatha&#x27;s love interests. He is torn between his loyalty to his father and his love for Agatha.
*Tarvek Sturmvoraus: A prince from Sturmhalten, who is the direct descendant of the legendary 17th century &quot;Storm King&quot; Andronicus Valois. Though only introduced in Volume 6 (after it moved to webcomic format), Tarvek later became one of Agatha&#x27;s love interests.
*The Jägermonsters or Jägers: A type of super-soldiers serving House Heterodyne.
*Zeetha: A lost warrior-princess from a faraway land known as Skifander. She volunteers to mentor Agatha.
*Krosp: An artificially-made cat with human intelligence and one of Agatha&#x27;s sidekicks.
*Othar Tryggvassen: A self-styled &quot;Gentleman Adventurer&quot; and a Spark who seeks to kill all the Sparks in the world, ending with himself.

==Publication history==

The idea for the style of &quot;Girl Genius&quot; came about when Kaja Foglio went through some of Phil&#x27;s loose drawings, saying in an interview: &quot;I was going through all of Phil&#x27;s old files and I was filing all of the old sketches, and I was coming across weird airships and cats in tophats with walking canes, and all of this wonderful... Victoriana sci-fi stuff... it was like &#x27;Oh, this is everything I love!&#x27;&quot; Phil Foglio said, &quot;We wanted to do something with a strong female lead character. We both like the tropes associated with mad science, and I really enjoy drawing fiddly Victorian-style gizmos&quot;.

Agatha Heterodyne first appeared in print in 1995 in a GURPS sourcebook that the Foglios illustrated. Phil Foglio states that plotting for &quot;Girl Genius&quot; started in 1993, and it was first published in 2000. &quot;Girl Genius: The Secret Blueprints Vol. I&quot; was printed in January 2001, followed closely by the monochrome Issue 1 in February. In 2005 &quot;Girl Genius&quot; became a webcomic, and quarterly print publication of the comic ceased.

The first three printed issues (which make up Volume 1) were in black and white. Subsequent printed and web comics were in color. Volume 1 was inked by Brian Snoddy, Volumes 2 and 3 by Mark McNabb. Volume 4 by Laurie E. Smith, and all subsequent volumes by Cheyenne Wright. Wright also colored the comics of Volume 1; these colored versions were used for a new print edition of Volume 1 and have replaced the original comics on the website.

In an interview recorded in January 2008, shortly before they began releasing pages of volume 8 of &quot;Girl Genius&quot; on their web site, the Foglios stated that they expected the climax of Volume 8 to be the rough equivalent of &quot;the end of the first season,&quot; and that it would provide a logical break in case of author catastrophe and a fresh jumping-on point for new readers. However, this was an underestimate of the length of the remaining &quot;first season&quot;: the end of Volume 13 turned out to be approximately halfway through the planned overall story arc. The &quot;second season&quot; of the series began March 3, 2014, with &quot;Act 2, Volume 1,&quot; after a two-month hiatus of the main story.

===Published collections===

The webcomic, as well as the initial printed issues, have been collected into printed volumes, and in some cases those volumes have been collected into printed omnibuses. Unless stated in the notes below, the books reprint works first published as the webcomic.

==== The First Journey of Agatha Heterodyne (also called &quot;Act 1&quot;) ====
==== The Second Journey of Agatha Heterodyne (also called &quot;Act 2&quot;) ====
==&quot;Girl Genius&quot; in other media ==
&quot;Girl Genius&quot; has been adapted, or proposed for adaptation, for other media:

=== Novels ===

The Foglios have written four Girl Genius prose novels, which follow the same story as the comics:

*&quot;Agatha H. and the Airship City&quot;, covering volumes 1–3 of the comic;
*&quot;Agatha H. and the Clockwork Princess&quot;, covering volumes 4–6;
*&quot;Agatha H. and the Voice of the Castle&quot;, covering volumes 7–9; and
*&quot;Agatha H. and the Siege of Mechanicsburg&quot; covering volumes 10–13.

The prose novels are published by Night Shade Books.

===Games===
*Agatha Heterodyne appeared in two illustrations and by name in the 1995 role-playing game supplement GURPS Illuminati University. This sourcebook for GURPS was illustrated by the Foglios and predates the release of the comic.
*&quot;Girl Genius: The Works&quot; is a card game designed by Phil Foglio and James Ernest, published in 2001. This game was an adaptation of an earlier game involving the Foglios called &quot;XXXenophile.&quot;
*&quot;Girl Genius and the Rats of Mechanicsburg&quot; is a mobile game released in 2014 following a Kickstarter in 2012.
*A role-playing game, &quot;Girl Genius Sourcebook and Role-playing Game&quot;, was released in 2021 by Steve Jackson Games. A role-playing game had been first announced as early as 2004.
*A video game, &quot;Girl Genius: Adventures In Castle Heterodyne&quot;, was released in 2023 after a Kickstarter in 2020.
=== Movie ===
In 2010 it was reported that Felicia D. Henderson had optioned the rights to &quot;Girl Genius&quot; and was adapting it into a movie. However, no movie had been produced.

== Awards ==
&quot;Girl Genius&quot; and its creators have won multiple Hugo Awards and Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards (WCCAs). They have also been nominated for further Hugo awards, WCCA awards, and Eisner Awards.

<text>Cuautla (, meaning &quot;where the eagles roam&quot;), officially La heroica e histórica Cuautla, Morelos (&quot;The Heroic and Historic Cuautla, Morelos&quot;) or H. H. Cuautla, Morelos, is a city and municipality in the Mexican state of Morelos, about 104 kilometers south of Mexico City. In the 2010 census the city population was 154,358. The municipality covers . Cuautla is the third most populous city in the state, after Cuernavaca and Jiutepec. The city was founded on April 4, 1829. The 2020 population figures were 187,118 inhabitants for the municipality and 157,336 inhabitants for the city of Cuatula.

The Cuautla Metropolitan Area, the second largest in Morelos, comprises the municipalities of Cuautla, Yautepec, Ayala, Yecapixtla, Atlatlahucan, and Tlayacapan. It covers , which represents 21.26% of the state&#x27;s total area. The metropolitan population (2010) is 434,187.

==History==
===Prehispanic history===
The Olmec group who lived in Chalcatzingo (southeast of Cuautla) founded settlements in Cuautla, Tepalcingo, Jonacatepec (Las Pilas), Olintepec, Atlihuayan, Huaxtepec, Gualupita de Cuernavaca, Tlayacapan, etc. (Piña Chan y Plancarte).

Five years after the conquest of &quot;Cuahunahuác&quot; (Cuernavaca) in (1379 CE), Moctezuma Ilhuicamina conquered Huaxtepec (Oaxtepec), Yautepec, Tlayacapan and other towns of Morelos and Guerrero. With Huaxtepec, which was the prehispanic and colonial capital of the peoples of the &quot;Plan de Amilpas&quot;, its 25-human settlements including &quot;Cuauhtlán&quot;, had to pay a tribute of 400 cotton blankets, 400 two-color valances, 400 bedspreads, 800 thin cotton blankets, 400 pairs of shorts (&quot;patees&quot;), 200 women&#x27;s shirts, and 1,200 veils (&quot;mantillas&quot;) every 80 days. In addition, they were required to contribute labor.

===Spanish conquest and colonial period===
The &quot;Plan de Amilpas&quot; including Cuautla was conquered by Captain Gonzalo de Sandoval on March 14, 1521. In 1543 New Spain was organized into four provinces: Michoacán, México, Coatzacoalcos, and Las Mixtecas; the present territory of Morelos was part of the Mexico province.

The church and monastery of San Diego were built between 1560 and 1580. The church is relatively small and austere, although there is a beautiful cupola on the south side. The façade of the church is made of pink granite with well-defined bases, columns, and cornices. The small, two-level belltower is square and simple. The monetary is high and formal; it may have been built after the church. The church is unique in that it faces the east, there is no real atrium, and there are neither &quot;capillas posas&quot; nor an open chapel. Construction of the church of Santo Domingo also began in the middle of the 16th century, but there is little information on it.

After the conquest, Indigenous lands were confiscated, mostly for sugar cane plantations and mills (&quot;trapiches&quot;). Despite Indigenous protests, Viceroy Gaspar de Zúñiga ruled in favor of the colonists on July 5, 1603. In 1646 the province of México became the &quot;Real Audiencia;&quot; Cuautla became an &quot;alcaldia&quot; (mayoralty) belonging to the Intendencia of Puebla.

===Independence &amp; 19th century===
After a number of successful battles, General José María Morelos arrived in Cuautla in December 1811. On February 19, 1812, Spanish General Félix María Calleja began the 72-day Siege of Cuautla. Morelos was accompanied by Leonardo Bravo, Mariano Matamoros, Hermenegildo Galeana, Nicolás Bravo, and Manuel de Ordiera. 12-year-old Narciso Mendoza, known as the &quot;Niño Artillero&quot; (Child Gunner) is remembered for stopping an advance of royalist troops by setting off a cannon. Morelos and his army were able to break out on May 2, 1812.

Cuautla was designated a &quot;Heroic City&quot; (&quot;Heroica Ciudad de Morelos&quot;) on April 4, 1829, while Felipe B. Montero was &quot;Presidente Municipal&quot; (mayor).

An 1865 photograph shows the construction of the second floor of the &quot;Palacio Municipal&quot; (city hall) in 1865. The building was burned during the Revolution.

The railroad station was opened on June 18, 1881, next to the &quot;Convento de San Diego&quot;. Tourist trains continue to operate along the line.

===Revolution &amp; 20th century===
As a young man, Emiliano Zapata was concerned about land seizures in Anenecuilco, his hometown. In May 1911 he answered Francisco I. Madero&#x27;s call to arms against President Porfirio Díaz. After minor battles in Chietla, Izúcar, Metepec Atlixco, Yautepec, and Jonacatepec, he arrived at Cuautla on May 11, 1911. With 4,000 or 5,000 troops he surrounded the city, and the week-long Battle of Cuautla (1911) began. The battle was a major turning point in the Mexican Revolution, as Porfirio Díaz said the battle convinced him to sign the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez and resign.

Nearly seven years later, in April 1919, Colonel Jesus Guajardo assassinated Zapata, apparently under orders of President Venustiano Carranza in Hacienda Chinameca, Ayala. His body was placed on a mule and left on the street before he was brought to Cuautla for burial.

The city hall was burned during the Battle of Cuautla in 1911; the bell &quot;Nuestra Señora de Dolores&quot; was transferred from the Church of Guadalupita on February 19, 2017 when the city hall was restored.
===21st century===
Six people, including an 11-year-old child, were killed in the September 17, 2017 Puebla earthquake.

Jesus Corona Damian of &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018.

Tetelcingo was scheduled to become an autonomous municipality on January 1, 2019, but Cuautla authorities objected.

As of May 4, 2020, there were 505 infections and 59 deaths in the state of Morelos and 62 confirmed infections from the COVID-19 pandemic in Cuautla. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On June 2, Cuautla reported 224 confirmed cases and 34 deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Cuautla reported an increase of 137 new cases from January 12 to 14, 2021, making 1,602 cases in all, second highest in the state. On March 8 Cuautla became the third municipality in Morelos to vaccinate senior citizens (60+).

Irving Eduardo Solano Vera (&quot;El Profe&quot;), said to be the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), was arrested in Colonia Santa Rosa on February 18, 2021.

<text>Emmet John Hughes (December 26, 1920 – September 18, 1982) was a foreign bureau chief for and article editor for Time-Life and an aide and speechwriter for U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His is also known for his 1962 memoir &quot;The Ordeal of Power&quot;, a scathing review that questioned Eisenhower&#x27;s political smarts and depicted Eisenhower as ill-suited for the White House.

==Career==
Hughes was born on December 26, 1920, in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout his life, he was a devout Catholic.

After serving in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1946, Hughes first worked as a press attaché at the United States Embassy in Spain. He thereafter was the bureau chief in Rome for Time-Life International in 1947 then in Berlin in 1948. The following year he transferred to New York where he was the editor for &quot;Life&quot; magazine (1949-1953), the special European correspondent (1953-1956), the editor of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine (1956-1957), and the chief foreign correspondent (1957-1960).

He was later a &quot;Newsweek&quot; columnist and editorial consultant (1963-1968).

During the Eisenhower administration, Hughes was an aide to and speechwriter for the president. Hughes wrote Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;I shall go to Korea&quot; speech, which helped solidify the 1952 election. Hughes then accompanied the president-elect on the promised trip to Korea.

After criticizing the Eisenhower administration in the late 1950s, Hughes published &quot;The Ordeal of Power&quot;. This break with Eisenhower led Hughes to begin a new relationship as the political advisor for the Rockefeller family, and worked as a political advisor and speechwriter for Governor Nelson Rockefeller during his unsuccessful presidential bid in 1968.

In 1969, he was asked to give the first John Courtney Murray Lecture sponsored by &quot;America&quot;.

From 1970 until his death, Hughes served as professor of political science at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.

Hughes graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1941. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. His first year of graduate studies at Columbia University was cut short by World War II.

Hughes had a son (John) with his first wife Mariefrances Pfeiffer, two daughters (Mary Larkin and Kathleen Freeman) with Eileen Lanouette, and two more daughters (Caitlin and Johanna) with Katherine Nouri. Hughes died in his home in Princeton, New Jersey.

== Books written by Hughes ==
*&quot;America The Vincible&quot; (1959)
*&quot;Report from Spain&quot; (1947)
*&quot;The Ordeal of Power: A Political Memoir of the Eisenhower Years&quot; (1963)
*&quot;The Living Presidency: The Resources and Dilemmas of the American Presidential Office&quot; (1973)

<doc id="732085" wikidata="Q6831249" url="?curid=732085" title="Michael Houser">
<text>Michael Houser (January 6, 1962 – August 10, 2002) was a founding member and lead guitarist of the band Widespread Panic. He appeared on seven studio albums during his 16-year tenure with the band from 1986 till 2002. He is also featured on 4 live albums by Widespread Panic as well as several archive releases, live video concerts and compilations. Two solo albums by Houser were released posthumously.

==Musical career==
Michael &quot;Mikey&quot; Houser was born in Boone, North Carolina. He graduated from Hixson High School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and became a founding member of Widespread Panic in 1986 while attending the University of Georgia with John Bell. Michael&#x27;s adolescent nickname was &quot;Panic&quot; due to his then frequent panic attacks, and this moniker later became the inspiration for the band&#x27;s name.

Widespread Panic&#x27;s large rhythm section, and John Bell&#x27;s virtuosity as a rhythm guitarist, allowed Michael to pursue an atmospheric lead guitar style that often lingered behind the primary melodies. His predominant use of the volume pedal caused him to spend most of his performance time balanced on one leg, this would eventually lead to circulation problems causing his left leg to become numb. In 1996, during an acoustic tour known as the &quot;Sit and Ski&quot; tour, he was reminded of how much more comfortable and accurate his playing was while he was seated. Subsequently, Houser returned to playing all shows seated in 1997. His playing style used a volume pedal for sonic effect, rather than just for volume control.

Widespread Panic always shared writing credits for all of their songs during the Houser era, but he wrote many of the band&#x27;s standards, including &quot;Pleas,&quot; &quot;Porch Song,&quot; &quot;Airplane,&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand,&quot; &quot;The Waker,&quot; &quot;Impossible,&quot; &quot;Pilgrims,&quot; &quot;You Got Yours,&quot; &quot;This Part of Town,&quot; &quot;Vacation,&quot; &quot;Postcard,&quot; and others. 

Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early 2002, he died on August 10 of that year, in Athens, Georgia, at the age of 40. A solo album of his instrumentals entitled &quot;Door Harp&quot; was released after his death, and was followed by &quot;Sandbox&quot; in 2006. He is survived by his wife Barbette and two children, Waker and Eva.
Widespread Panic has continued to tour and record after Houser&#x27;s death, as was his wish.

==Equipment==
Houser played a discontinued Fender Telecaster Deluxe Plus. This guitar is a Telecaster body with Stratocaster hardware. Houser purchased his first Telecaster Deluxe Plus second hand in 1991. A guitar lasted him about five years, needing to be replaced &quot;&#x27;cause [he] sweated into [them] so much&quot;. Fender made two custom-remake replacements with his preferred discontinued &quot;Firestorm&quot; finish. Houser claimed of the three guitars, &quot;they&#x27;re as close as modern science can get&quot;.

These guitars had Lace Sensor pickups (a Blue at the neck, and a dual Red at the bridge with a mini switch to split them), a Strat-style tremolo behind the metal place surrounding the bridge pickups, and a roller nut. Houser didn’t like to use a whammy bar, preferring to pull up on the tail of the bridge instead. The mini switch is in between the volume and tone pots. This allows for a wider array of tones than a standard Telecaster. On most Telecasters, you can choose neck, bridge, or both pickups simultaneously. With the dual Reds in the bridge being splittable, you can choose neck, bridge dual, bridge single, or combinations of neck and dual bridge as well as neck and single bridge.

Houser&#x27;s signature sound was also due to his use of Soldano SLO-100 Super Lead Overdrive Heads through a Mesa Boogie Quarterback 2x12 Cabinet. He played Medium Gauge D&#x27;Addario Strings.

His effects included the Soldano Surf Box Spring Reverb / Tremolo / Vibrato unit, a Boss GE-7 Equalizer, the Ernie Ball 6166 Mono Volume Pedal, a TC Electronic TCF Chorus/Flanger and a Kendrick Model 1000 Tube Reverb.

<text>Emiliano Zapata is a city in the west-central part of the Mexican state of Morelos. It stands at . The city serves as the county seat (&quot;sede municipal&quot;) for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality is the sixth largest in the state of Morelos, with a 2020 census population of 107,053 inhabitants, and has it an area of 64.983 km2 (25.09 sq mi). The city of Emiliano Zapata had 64,084 inhabitants in 2020. The city was previously known as both San Francisco Zacualpan and San Vicente Zacualpan. It was renamed in honor of Mexican Revolutionary Emiliano Zapata.

Subsidiary county seats (&quot;ayudantias&quot;) are: &quot;Tres de Mayo&quot;, (population 20,950); known principally for its ceramic, &quot;Tezoyuca&quot; (population 5,501); where a cement factory and a water park are located, &quot;Tetecalita&quot; (population 3,963), &quot;Tepetzingo&quot; (population 2,292) and &quot;Tetecalita&quot; (population 3,963).

==History==

===Prehispanic History===
Oral tradition states that the founders of &quot;Tzacualpan&quot; were originally from Tepoztlán, Tejalpa, and Xitepeptl (both in modern Jiutepec). It is said that an ambitious peasant fell in love with a royal princess, much to the rage of her father. The young man was forced to pay high tributes and he was forced to move elsewhere, finally settling on a plain between a bald hill and a hill of the gods. With time this area became a part of a powerful lord who fought against the Lord of Cuauhnahuac in 1389.

===Colonial Period===
After the conquest in 1521, Hernán Cortés was named Marqués de Oaxaca; his lands included present-day Morelos. In 1534 the territory of Morelos fell under the jurisdiction of the Province of Mexico City. The territory that today makes up the modern municipality of &quot;Emiliano Zapata&quot; was known as Tzacualpan, and the Spanish added the name San Francisco. Since it was near the Franciscan monastery of Santiago de Xiutepec, this area came to be called &quot;San Francisco Tzacualpan&quot;. Don Pedro Cortés, 4th Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca, founded the hacienda of San Vicente Tzacualpan at that time.

In 1618 Diego de Alarcón was granted of land, where he established a rich sugar cane hacienda. This became the center of the town.

===19th Century===
Mexico became independent in 1821, and the present state of Morelos became part of the State of Mexico. In 1840, the town was renamed San Vicente Zacualpan in honor of the hacienda owner, Governor Vicente de Eguia.

In 1856, the hacienda of San Vicente changed hands; owned by Don Pío Bermejillo and administered by his brother, Nicolás. Not far, near the Hill of Sayula, was the Hacienda of Dolores, which was dependent upon San Vicente. The cattle of Trinidad Carrillo, who rented land from Hacienda Dolores, damaged some of the sugar cane of Hacienda Dolores. Nicolás Bermejillo kicked Carrillo off the land, and the latter vowed revenge. Enlisting the aid of Nicolás Leite and Matías Navarrete, on December 18, 1856, they attacked San Vicente and killed four high-ranking men; Bermejillo was not present. In September 1858, the killers were tried for assault, robbery, and murder at the haciendas of Chiconcuac and San Vicente.

Morelos became a state in 1869.

===20th century===
Local residents who fought in the Mexican Revolution (1910-1921) included General Modesto Rangel and the soldiers Ricardo Catalán, Venancio Jiménez, Francisco Mariaca, Natividad Vázquez, Santos Delgado, Teodulo Olivan, Feliciano Flores, Refugio Angelino, Javier Montes De Oca, Martín Batalla, and Aureliano Trujillo.

In 1930 the government decreed that no community could use a saint&#x27;s name, so San Vicente Zacualpan became &quot;Emiliano Zapata&quot; in honor of the Revolutionary hero. President Álvaro Obregón made a historic visit in 1922. Post-revolutionary land partitioning ended in 1927.

Governor Vicente Estrada Cajigal established the municipalities Atlatlahucan and Emiliano Zapata on December 15, 1932; the town of Zapata designated the capital of the latter. The villages of Tezoyuca, Tepetzingo, and Tetecalita were part of the municipality.

Drinking water was provided to the community in 1935. The former hacienda of San Vicente was turned over to the people in 1942. The Rice Cooperative was established in 1944, and the San Vicente Agricultural Association was established in 1963.

===21st century===
There were two major earthquakes in 2017. The Chiapas earthquake on September 7 did not cause any damage in Morelos, but the 2017 Puebla earthquake centered in Axochiapan twelve days later killed over 300 people and caused physical damage to 20,000 buildings. In Zapata, 142 homes were destroyed and 248 were damaged.

Ana Olivia Albarran Salazar of PVEM (Green Party) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the July 1, 2018 election.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020; eight cases were reported in Emiliano Zapata. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On June 2, Zapata reported 42 confirmed cases and five deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Emiliano Zapata reported 170 cases, 136 recuperations, and 28 deaths as of August 31. Three hundred fourteen cases were reported on December 27.

Six men were killed and one woman was wounded in a shooting by unknown assailants in Colonia 3 de Mayo on June 6, 2020. Police officer Rodolfo Martínez Sánchez was assassinated in broad daylight in Colonia Tres de Mayo on December 27, 2020, in apparent revenge for a traffic ticket.

During the Revolution, General Genovevo de la O fought against the government. Huitizlac was burned in April 1912, and de la O was able to mobilize 4,000 men plus artillery to join in the fight to liberate Cuernavaca.

Peralta, Carlos Ariza, Carlos Vidal, Rafael Martínez de Escobar, Cecilio González, Enrique Monteverde, Alonso Capetillo Robles, Augusto Peña, Antonio Jáuregui, José Valle Arce, Octavio Almada, and Ernesto Noriega Méndez. On October 3, 1927, Serrano (a candidate for president) and his men were assassinated on the orders of President Álvaro Obregón. Martín Luis Guzman describes the incident in his novel, &quot;La sombra del caudillo.&quot;

On June 18, 2019, twelve Federal Police agents were sentenced to 34 years of prison for the August 24, 2012 murder of two CIA agents in Tres Marías.

. The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality reported 17,238 inhabitants in the year 2015 census.

The name Jantetelco comes from Nahuatl words meaning &quot;hill of adobe buildings&quot; and should be spelled &quot;Xamtetelko&quot;.&quot; Remains of adobe foundations have been found at the entrance to the town.

<text>Jiutepec is a city and its surrounding municipality in the Mexican state of Morelos.

The name &quot;Jiutepec&quot; comes from the Nahuatl name &quot;Xiutepetl&quot;, which means &quot;the precious stones hill&quot;.

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. Over recent decades Jiutepec has merged into neighboring Cuernavaca so that on its northeasterly edges it forms one geographically contiguous urban area with the latter. The Cuernavaca metropolitan area not only includes these two municipalities, but also Temixco, Emiliano Zapata, Xochitepec, and Tepoztlán municipalities, for a total population of 1,027,562 (February, 2018 figure also includes Huitzilac and Tlaltizapán).

According to the 2015 census the city of Jiutepec had a population of 153,704 while the municipality reported 214,137 inhabitants. The city and the municipality rank second in population in the state, behind the city and municipality of Cuernavaca. The municipality has an area of .

==History==
===Prehispanic history===
Nauhuatl-speaking people arrived in the state of Morelos in the 12th and 13th centuries, where they formed large, important domains such as &quot;Xiutépetl.&quot; In A.D. 1389, Xiutépetl fought a war against Cuauhanauhuac, Tetlama, and Yautepec. In 1425, Aztec emperor Ixcóatl conquered Jiutepec.

===Conquest &amp; colonialism===
Jiutepec amassed troops to fight Hernán Cortés on April 11, 1521, but they were defeated. Cortes rested for two days in Jiutepec before attacking Cuernavaca on April 13. During the colonial period, Jiutepec came under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Marquesado del Valle de Oaxaca&quot;. During the colonial period, four haciendas (San Gaspar, Atlacomulco, Dolores, and San Vicente) and several sugar mills were established. In 1807 there was a rebellion against don Vicente Eguía, and his lands were given to the people of Leyva.

===Independence &amp; 19th century===
After Mexican War of Independence, upon creation of the State of Mexico, Jiutepec became a municipality in the District of Cuernavaca. There were constant conflicts between the haciendas and the peasants over land and water during the 19th century. Hacienda San Vincente put so much pressure on the people of Amatitlan that they had to abandon their town; in 1852 the governor of the State of Mexico seized lands from the people of Jietepec to give to the Hacienda of Atlacomulco.

===Revolution &amp; 20th century===
Inhabitants of Jiutepec were extensively involved in the Mexican Revolution of 1910. In 1914 the Hacienda of Atlacomulco served as headquarters for the Army of Liberation during the Siege of Cuernavaca. &quot;El Texcal&quot; was the scene of numerous battles. The town of Jiutepec was burned by federal troops in retaliation on May 8, 1916; 225 revolutionaries were summarily judged and shot by (Carrancist) General Rafael Cepeda (&quot;El Democrata&quot; May 10, 1916; cited in the book &quot;Zapata y la Revolución Mexicana&quot;.

By 1932 land was redistributed in the form of &quot;ejidos&quot; (collective farmland). The municipality of Emiliano Zapata broke off Jiutepec on December 15, 1932, and Temixco broke off on March 3, 1933. The town of Progreso was founded in March, 1934, and there is a &quot;carnaval&quot; with Chinelos to celebrate. The colonia &quot;Agrícola Militar de José G. Parres&quot; was founded by veteran &quot;Zapatistas&quot; in the 1930s.

Many people of Jiutepec supported peasant leader Rubén Jaramillo in the 1950s and 1960s, and hundreds from Jiutepec attended his funeral in 1962.

In 1966 the &quot;Ciudad Industrial del Valle de Cuernavaca&quot; (CIVAC) was established. This industrial city was in conflict with the traditions of the municipality with little benefit in return, as the federal government decreed that industries established in the city would be exempt from taxes for thirty years. 4,000 hectares were expropriated from communal land in Tejalpa, without resistance based on promises that still have not been completed.

===21st century===
Jiutepec suffered considerably during the September 19, 2017 Puebla earthquake. Four people died and many buildings, were damaged.

Rafael Reyes Reyes of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018. On February 17, 2020, a large, publicly displayed &quot;manta&quot; (banner) accused Reyes Reyes of ties to &quot;Los Linos&quot; drug cartel.

Violence continues to effect Jiutepec. On February 23, 2019, between 15 and 20 armed robbers interrupted a party in &quot;Jardín Real Quinta Búhos&quot;, robbed the party-goers of their things, and stole at least twelve cars. Delfino Sánchez Zavala, the delegate-elect from Tejalpa, was shot and killed on March 30, 2019. The meeting of the town council planned for Sunday, March 31 was canceled.

Rafael Reyes Reyes, Municipal President, announced on May 20, 2019 that Jiutepec has a debt of MXN $745,341,125 (US $39.2 million), which is MXN $95 million more than its annual income.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020, 14 cases were reported in Jiutepec. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On June 2, Jiutepec reported 97 confirmed cases and 18 deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Despite the fact that Morelos was classified ″Red Semaphore,″ the auto industry was classified ″essential″ and all 2,600 employees at the Nissan plant in Civac returned to work on June 11, 2020. As infections passed 4,000 and deaths 900 in August, Jiutepec did little to prevent the spread of the virus and allowed large weddings wherein guests were not required to use face masks. Jiutepec reported 510 cases, 401 recuperations, and 83 deaths from the virus as of August 31. One thousand, twenty-nine cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

<text>Jojutla is a municipality in the state of Morelos, Mexico. Its municipal seat is the city of &quot;Jojutla de Juárez&quot;. The name &quot;Jojutla&quot; comes from Nahuatl &quot;Xoxōuhtlān&quot; () and means, &quot;Place of abundant blue skies&quot;. Another interpretation is Jojutla should be written Xo-Xoutla and its etymological roots come from: &quot;xoxou-ki&quot;, (dye called indigo) and &quot;Tla-ntli&quot;, (teeth) to indicate abundance, so the name means: &quot;Place abundant in blue paint&quot;. This meaning is corroborated by Father José Agapito Mateo Minos in &quot;Nohualco Tlalpixtican&quot; (1722), about how he saw the maceration and decanting tanks of the &quot;xoxouki&quot; plant, when it still existed in the plaza &quot;Zacate&quot;. Ángela Peralta mentions a unique pyramid consisting of three parts: the &quot;momozok&quot;, the turret and the &quot;campanile&quot; (tower), demolished by the colonial government. Remnants of this can be seen in the staircase of the municipal palace.

Jojutla has an area of 143 km2 (55.2 miles2), representing 2.88% of the state. It is located at 890 meters (2,920 ft.) above sea level. The municipality reported 57,121 inhabitants in the year 2015 census.

Lake Tequesquitengo and part of the Sierra de Huautla Biosphere Reserve are located in the municipality of Jojutla.

==History==
===Prehispanic History===
The area that is Jojutla today was covered by the internal Sea of Plancarte in the Paleozoic Era. The first inhabitants are believed to have arrived 22,000 years ago. Although fragments of obsidian, ceramic, and pottery have been found in the atriums of the chapels of &quot;Teocalzingo&quot;, &quot;Guadalupe&quot;, and &quot;Tlatenchi&quot;, no serious archaeological studies have been undertaken in the area. The &quot;Codex Mendoza&quot; tells us that people lived in Jojutla from 1425 to 1436 CE, when they were conquered by the troops of &quot;Izcóatl&quot; and Nezahualcóyotl, and submitted to the &quot;Calpixca Acolhua&quot; of Tlaquiltenango and the lordship of &quot;Cuauhnáhuac&quot;.

===Colonial Era===
The exact date when the Spanish arrived is unclear, but the establishment of the town of San Miguel Xoxutla suggests they arrived on September 29 of 1522 or 1523, considering that in 1524 they inaugurated the bridge and dam of &quot;Cuernavaquita&quot; in Tlaquiltenango under orders from Hernán Cortés. The area was governed by Tlaquiltenango, particularly after the arrival of the religious orders in 1549 and 1604.

The area around Xoxutla was quite swampy, so agriculture was not very profitable. The principal economic activities were fishing, production of indigo dye, and basketry.

As the population increased, a Sunday market developed in the &quot;Plaza de Arriba&quot; (atrium the church of San Miguel). The opening of the Acapulco-México trade route in the 17th century and the bridge of Our Lady of Guadalupe over the Apatlaco River on July 16, 1616, encouraged the growth of the market.

One confusing fact as to the date of foundation of Jojutla is that 18 families headed by &quot;Ignacio de la Luz&quot; fled from &quot;Chimalacatlan&quot; because of an epidemic. The Dominican friars of the &quot;Villa de Tlaquiltenango&quot; accepted them in the town of &quot;San Jerónimo Metl&quot;, on April 14, 1695. Incidentally, this confusion in part comes from Dr. Santos Amador Espinoza, who wrote &quot;Notes on the history of the City of Jojutla de Juárez&quot; in 1895, but whose information was later contradicted by Father José Agapito Mateo Minos Campuzano. The town of San Jerónimo Metl itself was devastated by a cholera epidemic in May 1770.

On September 14, 1722, in hacienda of San Gabriel, the muleteer José Cerón found an image of the crucified Christ, which was taken to the chapel of the hacienda, only to mysteriously disappear three times. The Dominican friars then took it their monastery in Tlaquiltenango on January 1, 1723, when it again disappeared, only to reappear on the main altar of the chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe, of the town of Archangel San Miguel Xoxutla. Since that time, there has been a festival in Xoxutla (Jojutla).

===Independence &amp; 19th century===
During the War of Mexican Independence Juan Antonio Tlaxcoapan of Tlaquiltenango led a group of citizens to meet Generals Vicente Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo in &quot;Chimalacatlan&quot; on September 8, 1813. The citizens of Jojutla did not join the Insurgents in Chilpancingo, and once their army withdrew Tlaxcoapan was taken prisoner and shot by Spanish authorities on November 6, 1813. Today he is recognized as a local hero.

Ricardo Sánchez moved to Jojutla on March 15, 1830, and in 1836 he introduced the cultivation of brown rice. Sánchez lobbied for the municipalization of the town of the Archangel San Miguel Xoxutla, which was granted by the government of the State of Mexico on March 29, 1847. Sánchez became the first municipal president and he rescheduled the feast of the &quot;Lord of Tula&quot; from September 14 to January 1.

The Jojutla Railway began on September 21, 1890.

On April 14, 1895, at the initiative of a group led by the priest &quot;Agapito Mateo Minos Campuzano&quot;, Jojutla celebrated its bicentennial.

===Revolution &amp; 20th century===
There was a bloody battle during the Mexican Revolution until the city was taken and looted by Maderistas under the command of Pablo Torres Burgo, and &quot;Gabriel Tepepa&quot;. The Revolutionaries sacked the city.

===21st century===
Andres Eloy Martínez Rojas, a Mexican astronomer (b. Cuernavaca, 1953) discovered a crater on Mars, which he named &quot;Jojutla&quot;. In 2017 the asteroid &quot;(6159) Andréseloy (1991 YH)&quot; was named in his honor.

An illegal, secret graveyard used by the government was discovered in Jojutla in March 2017. This was similar to the one found in Tetelcingo two years earlier. Of the 85 bodies found in Jojutla, 54 involved cases that the police had not even bothered to investigate. 30,000 people have &quot;disappeared&quot; in Mexico in the years up to February, 2018.

Jojutla was hit harder than anywhere else in Morelos during the September 19, 2017 earthquake. At least 73 people died and hundreds were injured. 652 homes were destroyed, 1,157 were damaged, and many other buildings, including schools and the &quot;Palacio Municipal&quot; (city hall), were damaged. More than two years later, in January 2020, residents were still waiting for reconstruction.

Juan Angel Flores Bustamonte of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018.

Two parachutists died on March 23, 2019, when their equipment failed and they landed in the Autopista del Sol at Kilometer 132, near &quot;Jardines de Mexico&quot;. They were employed by a school of parachutes in the area. Festival Vaivén 2019 (art &amp; music festival) was held in &quot;Jardines de Mexico&quot; on March 30, 2019.

&quot;La Secundaria Técnica número 34&quot; in Jojutla was the first middle school in the country to give classes in agroecology.

As of May 4, 2020, there were 505 infections and 59 deaths in the state of Morelos and 18 confirmed infections from the COVID-19 pandemic in Jojutla. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1.

In 2019 Hortencia Figueroa Peralta from Jojutla, former leader (PRD) of the state legislature, was convicted of misuse of MXN $23.7 million earmarked for employees. She won a temporary injunction against being sent to prison, but in May 2020 that expired and she will soon be sent to the state penitentiary in Atlacholoaya.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. The state office of DIF sent food and water to vulnerable groups of people in eight municipalities including Jojutla on May 26. On June 2, Jojutla reported 94 confirmed cases and 17 deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Jojutla reported 211 cases, 145 recuperations, and 46 deaths from the virus as of August 31. Three hundred sixty-two cases were reported on December 27, 2020. The hospital dedicated to the care of serious COVID-19 cases reached 100% capacity on January 15, 2021.

Known as &quot;The Sea of Morelos&quot;, &quot;Lake Tequesquitengo&quot; provides relaxation and fun such as water skiing, skydiving, snorkeling, bungee jumping, or scuba diving. There are hotels around the lake in all price categories.&quot;Teques&quot; is a popular weekend destination for Mexicans from the capital and the State of Morelos.
The lake has a tragic history. The general belief is that the village of Tequesquitengo was flooded by the &quot;Mosso brothers&quot;, who—according to Alfonso Toussaint—owned the &quot;San José Vista Hermosa&quot; hacienda in the mid-19th century, which was erected during the colonial era in the upper part of the valley. Newspapers of the nineteenth century pointed out that in the northern part of the valley there was a small lagoon, which was sustenance for the colonial town of Tequesquitengo, in addition to the &quot;tequesquite&quot;, a mineral from which the settlement took its name. Until a difference between the peasants and the &quot;hacendados&quot; caused the latter to divert the flow of surplus water from the irrigation channels of the hacienda to the valley, flooding it and forcing its settlers to settle on the shores of the lake that formed covering the town and its church, &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;.

Scholars differ about when the flooding began, suggesting dates between 1820 and 1880, with some blaming the earthquake of 1845.

<text>Jonacatepec de Leondro Valle is a city in the Mexican state of Morelos. The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality reported 15,690 inhabitants in the year 2015 census.
The name &quot;Jonacatepec&quot; comes from Nahuatl language and was written &quot;Xonakatepek &quot;. Its etymological roots come from &quot;Xonaka-tl&quot; (onion), &quot;Tepe-tl&quot; (hill), &quot;k apócope&quot; from the adverb &quot;ko&quot; (place) and means &quot;on the hill where there are onions&quot;. Leondro Valle is in reference to a supporter of the Plan de Ayutla of 1857 which opposed the dictatorship of Antonio López de Santa Anna. Leondro Valle was from the town of Jonacatepec.

Jonacatepec has 98 km2 (38 sq. miles), which represents 1.97% of the total area of the state. It is 1,290 meters (3,967 feet) above sea level.

==History==
===Prehispanic Era===
During the Prehispanic era, the first settlers of Morelos were the Olmec (1500-900 BCE), subject to Chalcatzingo who flourished in the Archaic period (700-500 BCE). After their decline, the Toltec predominated, with ruins in &quot;Las Pilas&quot;, which flourished from 500-650 CE. According to anthropologist Hortensia de Vega, the springs surrounding the site were the most important element for the establishment and development of the population. The explorations have uncovered a complex network of channels, unique in its kind. The water directed towards large deposits was stored to be used in dry times and distributed to crop fields that were far away from the springs. In this way, agricultural production was increased, so that they could trade surpluses and obtain the objects that they needed for the ceremonies of their religious cult and the offerings to their dead. The water was stored to be used in dry times and distributed to fields that were far away from the springs so agricultural production was increased, enabling them to trade their surpluses and obtain the objects that they needed for the ceremonies of their religious cult and the offerings to their dead. The importance of this cult is evidenced by the presence of several burials found in the canals; as far as we know it is the first time that irrigation channels were used as tombs.

Later Nahuas including the Chichimeca and Tlahuica emigrated to the area (1100-1521). &quot;Xonakatepek&quot; (Jonacatepec) was subservient to Huaxtepec. Oaxtepec, which itself was tributary to Tenochtitlan.

===Colonial Era===
In the year 1558, the temple and convent of the town of Jonacatepec were founded, dedicated to St. Augustíne of Hippo. Its founders were Fray Jerónimo de San Esteban and Juan Cruzate, who are buried under the altar of this church. The main feature of this property is the size; this is the largest atrium in Morelos. The cloister of this convent is well-preserved.

In 1646 the province of Mexico was called &quot;audience of Mexico&quot;, subservient to Cuautla de Ampillas, until the year 1824. The neighborhood of &quot;San Francisco&quot;, the most populated; of its chapel there is no record of its construction, although it is believed it dates from 1774.

Due to the high population density, at least eight &quot;trapiches&quot; (sugar mills) were located in the east of Morelos, taking advantage of the water of the Amacuzac River. Two haciendas, &quot;Santa Clara de Montefalco&quot; in Jonacatepec and &quot;Santa Ana Tenango&quot;in Jantetelco, gradually dominated the villages of Tlanahuac-Chalcatzingo.

The beginnings of &quot;Santa Clara de Montefalco&quot; date back to 1616. Pedro Cortés, a grandson of the Conqueror Hernán Cortés, rented the land (almost 86 hectares) and a ranch (about 780 hectares) to Pedro Aragón in 1616. Over the years, even during the Mexican Revolution, the hacienda stayed in the same family until it was sold to Opus Dei in 1952.

The hacienda of &quot;Santa Ana Tenango&quot; has its origin in part from a grant in 1589 by the viceroy &quot;Márquez de Villa Manrique&quot;, to its first owner, Luis Rebolledo. He established the first sugar mill around 1640 and later passed it to his son Francisco de Rebolledo, who in turn sold the farm in 1650 to Pedro Sáenz de Rosas. Pedro Segura settled in Jonacatepec and tried to improve the lives of the few inhabitants. Martín de la Rosa, a relative of Pedro Trápaga de Rosas, is credited with the construction of the bridge of the deep ravine, as well as the donation of the image of the &quot;Lord of the Three Falls&quot; to the chapel of the San Martín neighborhood, and of the &quot;Virgen de la Soledad&quot; to the chapel of San Francisco.

During all this time, the sugar haciendas were able to become richer and more powerful.

===Early Independent Period===
After the independence of Mexico, in 1855, the Jonacatepec district was legally recognized. Six years later, in 1861, the people of the town refused to recognize the presidency of Benito Juarez, choosing Porfirio Diaz instead, with Feliciano Chavarría as Governor of Morelos. The rebels of Jonacatepec were defeated in battle by forces under the command of General Jose Fandiño; the rebels then fled to Tetela and Hueyapan. Rosario Aragón, principal author of the &quot;Plan of Jonacatepec&quot;, was apprehended in Villa del Valle, State of Mexico.

On October 17, 1861, the Legislature of the State of Mexico created the districts of Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Yautepec, Tetecala, and Jonacatepec. On November 14 of that same year, the head offices of the District were designated as villas, except for those that were already cities. On July 7, 1862, President Benito Juarez changed the name of the community to &quot;Jonactepec de Leandro Valle&quot; in honor of a fallen native of the town who had supported him. Morelos became a state in 1869.

The haciendas of Santa Clara and Tenango expanded during the Porfiriato (1877-1911) to produce quantities of sugar never reached before. Besides Santa Clara and Tenango, the haciendas of San Ignacio (now Marcelino Rodríguez), Cuatepec, and Atotonilco prospered. Jonacatepec also prospered, but the series of injustices and dispossessions committed against the people at this stage caused yearning for the Mexican Revolution. Eventually, the liberal &quot;Club Leandro Valle&quot; was formed in Jonacatepec in opposition to the re-election of Governor of Morelos Pablo Escandón (1909-1911) and all he represented.

===Revolution &amp; 20th Century===
Following the success of the Plan of Agua Prieta in 1920, General Francisco Mendoza was put in charge of eastern Morelos with a base in Jonacatepec.

Governor of Morelos Antonio Riva Palacio and his attorney general, Tomás Flores Allende, were nearly lynched in Jonacatepec after the police attacked several of the townspeople on August 5, 1993. The citizens were repressed by &quot;Grupo Scorpion&quot; under the command of Colonel Jorge Encinas Gutiérrz.

===21st Century===
Although Jonacatec did not report the loss of lives, the municipality was severely damaged in the 2017 Puebla earthquake. At least 700 homes were destroyed, and many others were damaged.

Israel Andrade Zavala of &quot;Juntos por Morelos PRD-PSD&quot; was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018.

While the state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020, no cases were reported in Jonacatepec. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. Sixty-nine cases were reported on December 27, 2020. Vaccinations for senior citizens (60+) are scheduled to begin on March 12, 2021.

==Communities==
The municipality reported 15,690 inhabitants in the year 2015 census. 
The largest communities in the municipality of Jonacatepec are: Jonacatepec de Valle, the municipal seat, which is located 97–119 km (depending on the route used) east of Cuernavaca, 132 km south of Mexico City, and 87 km southwest of Puebla. Amacuitlapilco is 1.5 km from Jonacatepec. It has a population of 1,873 inhabitants. It is considered an Indigenous community of Tlahuica descent. It is 1,359 meters above sea level. There are one preschool, two elementary schools, and one telesecundaria. In addition, there are two preschools that conduct classes in Indigenous languages. Tetelilla is 8 km from Jonacatepec and has a population of 3,182 inhabitants. It is 1,164 meters above sea level. There is one preschool, two elementary schools, and one middle school. Tlayca is 4 km from Jonacatepec and has 506 inhabitants. It is 1,357 meters above sea level. There is one preschool and one elementary school.

==Notable people==
Leandro Valle (1833-1861) was born in Mexico City on February 27, 1833. He spent his childhood in the town of Jonacatepec with his father. In 1836 General Antonio López de Santa Anna fell prisoner in &quot;Tejas&quot; (Texas), so Leandro Valle grew up under signs that Santa Anna could not consolidate the nascent Republic. In 1844, at the age of 11, he entered the Military College, graduating at 14 as Second Lieutenant and then fought in the Mexican–American War (1846-1848). After the war, he joined the Liberal Party and supported the 1854 Plan de Ayutla, which led to the ouster of Santa Anna and the election of Juan Álvarez as President of Mexico in Cuernavaca.
Valle participated in the Reform War (1857-1860) distinguishing himself in the battles of &quot;Guadalajara, Silao&quot;, and &quot;San Miguel Calpulalpan&quot;; he was promoted to general at the age of 26. The Liberals won the war, and Benito Juárez became president. When Liberal hero Melchor Ocampo was kidnapped and murdered in Hidalgo by conservative guerrillas June 1861, Juárez sent Santos Degollado to capture the aggressors. Santos was also killed, and Juarez sent Valle to finish the job; Valle was also captured, then shot in the back, and his body was hung from a tree on June 23, 1861.

Agustín Aragón León (1870-1954) was an educator and politician born in Jonacatepec. He was a promoter of the positivist ideology and was the founder and editor of the magazine &quot;Positiva&quot;.

==Attractions and culture==
In June 2017 the town council headed by the mayor, Israel Andrade Zavala, developed the &quot;Municipal Plan for Tourism Development of Jonacatepec de Leandro Valle, Morelos&quot; according to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). The priorities are taking advantage of the town&#x27;s historic center, the St. Augustine monastery, Las Pilas archaeological zone and water park, &quot;El Cristo del Mirador&quot; park, plus local cuisine. It is hoped that the town will be certified as a &quot;Magical Town&quot;.

=== Las Pilas water park and Archaeological Site ===
&quot;Las Pilas&quot; is the name of both a small water park and the ancient ruins found there. Located in Jonacatepec, the rustic water park has swimming pools and offers guided tours of the archaeological site.

The ruins of Las Pilas date from a 1st-century BCE village, although the most visible ruins date from 500-650 CE. Las Pilas was probably subject to Chalcatzingo, an Olmec an important religious and commercial center of great importance at that time that is only 4 km away. It is very possible that this site was subject to Chalcatzingo since it was a religious and commercial center of great importance at the time. The ceremonial center of Las Pilas was integrated by square constructions, and there is a complex system of canals used for irrigation. Another of the functions of this religious center seems to have been related to the water deities, possibly Tlaloc, which would explain the human burials placed in a strange lotus position in or near the channels. The site&#x27;s main chronology is Early Classic, from 200 to 600 CE.

=== Ex Convento de San Agustín ===
The monastery of St. Augustine of Hippo, was founded about 1557 by the Augustinians, and by 1571 it supervised nine other churches. It was in continuous use until the middle of the 19th century, by which time it used a home for the parish priest, police barracks, a school, and a theater, while the atrium was used as a cemetery, a market, and a soccer field.

The atrium of the monastery is very large, which indicates that the Indigenous population subject to the head of San Agustín Jonacatepec during the colonial period was considerable. The traditional &quot;Onion Fair&quot; is celebrated in the atrium today. There are several elaborate tombs attached to the church dating from the 19th century. Three of the tombs have distinctive Masonic markings, including fluted columns and an elongated pyramid. It is believed that Masonry arrived in Mexico towards the end of the 18th century.

There is evidence that the bell tower, south, and west sides of the building were all impacted by bullets at the time of the Mexican Revolution

There are two chapels inside the church, and the original wooden altarpieces, believed to be carved by one of the greatest artists of the viceroyalty, Higinio Lopez of Zacualpan de Amilpas, are well-preserved.

The feast of St. Augustine is celebrated on May 5, and the Onion Fair is the second or third Friday of December.

=== Ex Hacienda de Santa Clara Montefalco ===
In 1616 Pedro Cortés, grandson of Hernán Cortés, leased more than 860 hectares to Pedro de Aragón. Two years later he gave him a license to plant sugarcane and establish a sugar mill. In 1708 Pedro de Segura inherited part of the hacienda from Antonio de Arrigorrieta in 1708, and he bought the rest of it from Arrigorrieta&#x27;s widow and daughter. 32 years later, his nephew, Juan Francisco de Urtaza, inherited the mill and modernized it, establishing the base of the sugar emporium in eastern Morelos. Jose Antonio de Zalvide Goitia from Armentia, in the Basque country, inherited the hacienda from Urtaza in 1759. During the Mexican Revolution, the hacienda was burned and only a few walls remained standing. In 1952, the owners sold the hulk to Opus Dei, the conservative Catholic religious organization, to perform social work. They founded a school in 1961 and currently teach basic and upper secondary levels. Closed to the public.

===Fairs &amp; Festivals===
The principal fairs are the Fair of the &quot;Pabellón&quot; on the fourth Friday of Lent, the Fair of the &quot;Tamal&quot; on the fifth Friday of Lent, the Battle of Puebla on May 5 (a civic festival with a parade, bulls, and theatrical presentations), and the &quot;Fair of the Cebolla&quot; (onion) on the second or third Friday of December.

===Dance &amp; Music===
The &quot;Tecuán&quot; presents a character with old clothes, mocking mask and hat, carrying a stuffed animal in a traditional dance. While there is no music identified with the municipality, Zeferino Torres Montiel wrote &quot;Corrido de Jonacatepec&quot;.

===Food===
Popular foods include green mole of &quot;pipian&quot;with tamales of &quot;cenizas&quot;; red mole with turkey, cecina with cheese, cream and green sauce with &quot;guaje&quot;; goat barbecue kid meat and wild pigeons stewed in pipian or green sauce. There are also a wide variety of recipes based on onions.

<doc id="732101" wikidata="Q4671180" url="?curid=732101" title="Academic dress of the University of Cambridge">
<text>The University of Cambridge has a long tradition of academic dress, which it traditionally refers to as academical dress. Almost every degree which is awarded by the University has its own distinct gown in addition to having its own hood. Undergraduates wear college gowns, which are all subtly different; these differences enable the wearer&#x27;s college to be determined. Academic dress is worn quite often in Cambridge on formal, and sometimes informal, occasions, and there are a number of rules and customs governing when and how it is worn. Black gowns (undress) are worn at less formal events, while on special occasions (such as the days of General Admission to Degrees) full academical dress is worn, consisting of gown, hood and headdress with Doctors in festal dress. The University&#x27;s officials also have ancient forms of academic dress, unique to the University.

==When academic dress is worn==
Most undergraduates buy or borrow a gown in their first week at Cambridge for the purpose of matriculation, which is the formal ceremony of enrolment in the University. It is more common to buy an undergraduate gown as the number of occasions on which it is worn quickly repays the investment. Gowns are often recycled between &#x27;generations&#x27;, as new graduate students in turn need to upgrade their gowns at the start of the academic year.

In most colleges, gowns are worn to Formal Hall (formal dinner, held every night in some colleges, once or twice a term in a few others) and to Chapel. Various college events also demand academic dress; for example, in the Trinity College regulations for members &quot;in statu pupillari&quot;, it specifies that certain Senior Members of the College (such as the Dean) prefer students to wear a gown when addressing them in their official capacity (often when having been &#x27;Deaned&#x27; for breaking the College Rules). The extent to which these rules apply vary greatly from college to college, some dispensing with academic attire even for Formal Hall.

On special occasions, fuller academic dress is used, often including hoods. Students taking part in graduation ceremonies at the Senate House always wear a gown and hood, and the University sets out strict rules regarding which gown and hood a graduating student should wear, and there are regulations on the colour and formality of clothing that may be worn. Gowns and hoods may also be worn when attending chapel, and hoods may be worn with choir dress or a surplice.

==Components of Cambridge academic dress==

When wearing full academic dress, an individual wears the gown, hood and sometimes headdress of the highest degree he has already received from the University of Cambridge. One who does not hold a Cambridge degree (such as an undergraduate, or a graduate of another university) normally wears a gown according to his or her status in the University, i.e., undergraduate, BA status or MA status (see below), without the &#x27;strings&#x27; which are attached to the gowns of Cambridge graduates. Graduates of other universities may wear the academic dress of those universities on &#x27;scarlet days&#x27;, unless they are University officials or participating in a degree ceremony, but this has only been permitted since 1998.

A graduand (someone about to be presented for a degree) wears the full academic dress of the highest status Cambridge degree that they already hold. Graduands who do not already hold a Cambridge degree wear the gown appropriate to their status in the University, along with the hood of the degree to which they are about to be admitted. Undergraduates (who do not yet hold a Cambridge degree) wear their undergraduate gowns, with the hood of the degree that they are about to receive. Thus, for example, an undergraduate graduating to a BA degree wears an undergraduate gown and a BA hood. A holder of a BA from Cambridge graduating to a PhD wears a BA gown and hood, whereas a graduate of another university graduating to a PhD wears a BA or MA status gown and PhD hood.

Medical graduates completing their clinical years wear the gown and hood of the B.Chir degree. This is because the B.Chir degree is conferred &quot;in absentia&quot; as soon as the list of people passing the Final M.B. examination is posted outside Senate House. This was to prevent the necessity for a &#x27;double graduation&#x27; ceremony. It is common practice for students to hire the B.Chir academic dress, rather than purchase it, since it is superseded by the M.B. academic dress post graduation. Where students have completed both pre-clinical and clinical years at Cambridge, many do not purchase the M.B. academic dress, hiring it for occasions requiring academic dress (Alumni Formal Hall etc.) as this is superseded a couple of years later when the automatic Oxbridge MA is granted. Medical students graduate at the end of the third year with a Cambridge BA, and for this ceremony are treated as any other students graduating with a BA.

The full list of degrees and their order of seniority is given in the Ordinances of the university: roughly speaking, in descending order of rank the degrees are higher doctorates such as the DD or ScD, the PhD and other initial doctorates such as the MD or EdD, Master&#x27;s degrees, and finally Bachelor&#x27;s degrees. These different groups of degrees are distinguished by different academic dress.

===Gowns===
The gowns in use at Cambridge, like those generally used throughout the UK but not the US, are open-fronted. The main types seen are the undergraduate gown, Bachelor of Arts gown and Master of Arts gown, though the sleeves of graduates&#x27; gowns are adorned with various patterns that indicate the exact degree or degrees that they possess, and allow this to be determined even when hoods are not being worn. In addition, for Scarlet days, Doctors (either of Philosophy, or one of the more senior doctorates) wear special dress gowns, distinguished by the use of scarlet.

====Undergraduates====
All undergraduate gowns resemble knee-length versions of the BA gown, and the basic gown is black, reaching down to just below the knees with an open pointed sleeve and the forearm seam left open. Most colleges&#x27; gowns include minor variations on this pattern, such as sleeve decorations. The most distinct differences are the blue colour of the undergraduate gowns of Trinity and Caius and the blue facings of Selwyn. Illustrations and descriptions of the various collegiate gowns are available from the University&#x27;s Heraldic and Genealogical Society website.

====BA and MA====

The two most common graduate gowns in Cambridge are the BA gown and the MA gown. Unlike in most other universities, except Oxford and Trinity College Dublin, no Bachelor&#x27;s degree save the BA is awarded. All undergraduates at Cambridge traditionally graduated with a BA degree after three years, although it is now common for many graduates in scientific subjects also to obtain a Master&#x27;s degree, such as an MEng or MSci, after a further year of study and graduate to both degrees at once.

As in Oxford and Dublin, BAs are automatically entitled to proceed to the degree of Master of Arts after a period of time (see also Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)). In Cambridge, this period is six years from the end of the first term after matriculation provided this is at least two years from the award of the BA – BAs are thus eligible for the MA at the first graduation ceremony in the seventh calendar year after matriculation.

The BA gown is a long black stuff (cloth) gown with long pointed sleeves to the wrists with the forearm seam left open from near the shoulder to around 3-4&quot; from the wrist. The gown is gathered at the back in a yoke, and falls down to just below the knees. The BA hood is of black cloth, bound and half-lined in white fur, which by regulation is artificial.

The MA gown is similar to the BA gown, except that it has &quot;boot&quot; sleeves, which are long, rectangular and closed at the ends, with a crescent cut out of each sleeve-end which curves at the top (unlike the Oxford MA gown), and a horizontal arm-slit just above the elbow. It falls down to calf length (slightly longer than the BA gown) and may be made of silk. The MA hood is of black silk lined in white silk.

Other Master&#x27;s degree gowns vary from subject to subject at Cambridge; for example, the Master of Engineering (MEng) and MSci gowns are the standard MA gown but with a circle of cord on each sleeve, and a corresponding hood is worn. The MPhil gown is the same as the MSci gown, but instead of an embroidered wheel, it has two buttons connected by a vertical cord running from the sleeve slit to the shoulder.

People without a Cambridge degree (including those with a degree from another university) wear a &#x27;BA status&#x27; or &#x27;MA status&#x27; gown, which is identical to a BA or MA gown but (nominally) with the &#x27;strings&#x27; (black ribbons attached inside the shoulder) removed or hidden from view. The BA status gown is for those aged under twenty-four while the MA gown is for those aged twenty-four or over. (The rationale is that Cambridge students would usually join the University at 18, obtain their BA after three years, at 21, and their MA after a further three years, at 24.)

====Doctors====

Doctors in Cambridge have two forms of academic dress: &quot;undress&quot; and &quot;full dress&quot; (or &quot;scarlet&quot;). Scarlet is worn on formal college and University occasions, and so-called Scarlet Days (see below).

The &quot;undress gown&quot; or &quot;black gown&quot; is similar to the MA gown (for PhD, MD, VetMD, BusD, EngD, EdD, LittD, ScD and in practice DD) or is a &#x27;lay-type&#x27; gown similar to that worn by King&#x27;s Counsel (LLD, MedScD, MusD). Different doctorates are distinguished from each other and from the plain MA gown by different arrangements of lace on the sleeves, facings or flap collar. The DD traditionally had a gown with sleeves gathered at the wrists, like those on American gowns, which are called &#x27;bishop&#x27;s sleeves&#x27; or &#x27;pudding sleeves&#x27;.

Undress gowns may be made of silk or stuff. The gown may be worn with a doctor&#x27;s hood. The PhD hood, the one most commonly seen, is made of black corded silk lined with scarlet cloth, and other &#x27;lower&#x27; doctorates have variants on the same scheme with different colours lining the black hood. The hoods of higher doctors are made of red cloth and lined with silk in the faculty colour (scarlet for letters, pink shot light blue for science, light cherry for laws, mid cherry for medicine, dove grey for divinity). The MusD hood is of cream damask lined with dark cherry satin.

The &quot;full dress&quot; or &quot;scarlet gown&quot; differs for each doctorate. For PhDs, and also MD, VetMD, BusD, EngD and EdD who share the same scarlet gown, there are two versions of the robe. The traditional version is the same as the MA gown (in theory, though not in practice, the silk version), with the addition of a broad red cloth stripe down each side at the front. The alternative version (authorised in 2006 but commonly used without authorisation before then) uses detachable facings on an undress PhD gown, which is distinguished from the MA gown by doctors&#x27; lace on the sleeves that is not found on the traditional festal PhD gown. For the higher doctorates other than MusD (DD, LLD, ScD, LittD, and MedScD), the scarlet gown is made of scarlet cloth and has open sleeves that hang long at the back. The linings of the sleeves and the facings are in silk of the colour of the hood lining. At the sleeve front, the lining is turned outwards and is fixed in position by a twisted cord and button. The MusD gown is of cream damask, with much shorter sleeves, lined and faced with deep cherry satin.

=====&quot;Scarlet day&quot;=====
Scarlet day is the term used in the University of Cambridge to designate those days on which Doctors are required to wear the festal form of academic dress. They are so called because of the scarlet elements in the gowns and hoods of the festal full dress worn by Doctors as opposed to the everyday undress black gowns. On these days it is also permitted for members of the University to wear the academic dress of other Universities from which they have obtained degrees.

The ordinances of the University set out the following days as scarlet days: Christmas Day, Easter Day, Ascension Day, Whitsunday, Trinity Sunday, All Saints&#x27; Day, the day appointed for the Commemoration of Benefactors, and on the days of General Admission to Degrees. In addition, the Vice-Chancellor may prescribe other scarlet days throughout the year, for example on days of national celebration.

The individual colleges each have a few scarlet days of their own as well, such as on the day of their Saint.

===Hoods===
Hoods are worn on the back as an indicator of academic status. These are of the distinctive &quot;Cambridge Full&quot; shape. The hood consists of a cape (known also as the &#x27;tippet&#x27;), cowl and liripipe. The neckband of a hood is of the outer colour, with no edging of the lining material. The corners of tippets are square. The design of hoods as set by University Ordinances Chapter II is below.

On graduation, if a student does not hold a degree from the University of Cambridge, they wear the appropriate hood for the degree they will receive. If a student already holds one or more degrees from the University of Cambridge, they wear the hood of the highest degree that they hold. For example, when a MPhil student graduates, but already holds a BA from Cambridge, then they would wear the BA hood again.

===Headdresses===
A form of a black hat known as a square cap (also mortarboard) is worn or carried. Properly, it is worn outdoors and carried indoors, except by people acting in an official capacity who customarily continue to wear it indoors. Although in practice few people wear (or even carry) a cap nowadays, they are nominally still required for graduates at the University; caps ceased to be compulsory for undergraduates in 1943 due to a shortage during the Second World War, and, after bringing them back for degree ceremonies in the Senate House only, were finally made entirely optional for undergraduates in 1953, though they are still not permitted to wear any other head covering with a gown.

With their festal gowns, Doctors of Divinity wear a black velvet cap, and Doctors in other Faculties wear a wide-brimmed round velvet bonnet with gold string and tassels, known as a Tudor bonnet, instead of a mortarboard, though they may choose to wear a square cap with a festal gown if they are taking part in a ceremony in the Senate House.

===&quot;Sub-fusc&quot;===
&quot;Sub-fusc&quot; means &quot;of a dark/dusky colour&quot;, and refers to the clothes worn with full academic dress in Cambridge although the University officially does not use this term. Generally, this involves a dark suit and white shirt, collar, bands and bow tie for men (who must also wear black socks), and a dark suit and white blouse for women. The rules for dress on graduation for women also specify that women&#x27;s attire must have long sleeves. Although only male graduands are required to wear white ties and bands by a regulation, nothing prevents female graduands doing so too if they wear a properly collared shirt.

In place of &quot;sub-fusc&quot;, members of His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces have in the past been allowed to wear their service uniform, persons in holy orders their clerical dress, and national dress has been worn, together with the appropriate gown and hood. Currently as of 2007, national dress is no longer accepted as an alternative to &quot;sub-fusc&quot;. The proctors have discretion to waive the part of the regulations concerning dark clothes and white tie on &#x27;reasonable grounds&#x27;.

Notably, the rules governing Cambridge &quot;sub-fusc&quot; are less detailed and less strict than those prevailing at Oxford. In particular, bands may be worn at Oxford only by high officers of the University and by doctors on certain occasions. Some women are required to wear bands with a black tie (in practice a black velvet ribbon) while others holding certain offices are permitted the alternative of a white bow tie with their bands. At Cambridge, there are only strict &quot;sub-fusc&quot; rules in &quot;Statutes and Ordinances&quot; for graduation ceremonies, at which the rules are enforced strictly by the proctors. Persons who are incorrectly dressed may be prevented from graduating in person, and their Praelector or Presenter may be fined.

==Academic dress for officials of the University==
===The Chancellor===
The Chancellor of the University wears on ceremonial occasions a black silk gown with a long train, decorated with gold lace, similar to the gown of the Lord Chancellor.

=== Persons presenting for, or conferring, degrees ===
The Vice-Chancellor (or his/her deputy) when conferring degrees, and presenters of graduands for higher doctorates (Doctor of Divinity, Doctor of Law, Doctor of Science, Doctor of Medical Science, Doctor of Letters, Doctor of Music), wear a scarlet &quot;cappa clausa&quot;, or &quot;closed cope&quot; of scarlet cloth with an ermine hood and trimmings, as shown in the image to the right. Cambridge is the only university in the world apart from the University of the South in America to retain the &quot;cappa clausa&quot; as part of its academic dress.

College Praelectors, and all other presenters, wear the academical dress of their highest Cambridge degree when presenting graduands.

===Proctors===
The Proctors in Cambridge are formally responsible for the discipline of junior members of the University. In addition, they have various ceremonial and administrative duties, with which they are, in practice, mainly occupied.

In both Oxford and Cambridge, the Proctors could formerly be seen patrolling the streets after dark with the University Constables, or &quot;bulldogs&quot;, who wore top hats in Cambridge and bowler hats in Oxford. These traditions have now ceased, although the Proctors are still responsible for posting various disciplinary notices (e.g. highlighting the restriction on undergraduates&#x27; possession of motor cars) around the Colleges. Their Constables continue to wear top hats and cloaks on ceremonial occasions.

The Proctors wear the academic dress of a Master of Arts, but with a distinctive ruff which is like a cape or very short mantle over the gown. This is known as &#x27;Congregation dress&#x27; and is worn with the MA hood over it. When attending church, the hood is worn &quot;squared&quot;, meaning that the hood is first flattened then worn over the shoulders like a cape (Masters of Trinity College also wear their hood squared at their installation, but the previous two and incumbent did not do so for unexplained reasons, so it is assumed this tradition is no longer observed). The method of arranging this dress has been handed down, as has a pattern &quot;ruff&quot;, from Proctor to Proctor; but nowadays the repositories of such traditions are more often the Proctors&#x27; men, who, in these matters, perform the offices which judges expect of their clerks.

===Esquire Bedells===
The Esquire Bedells in Cambridge are ceremonial officers. The Senior Esquire Bedell is required to be familiar with all details of academical dress at the University. When carrying out the duties of his or her office, an Esquire Bedell is required to wear the academical dress of a Master of Arts.

===Other officials===
Other officials such as the Orator wear the academic dress appropriate to their degree.

<doc id="732108" wikidata="Q418776" url="?curid=732108" title="Sulfonylurea">
<text>Sulfonylureas or sulphonylureas are a class of organic compounds used in medicine and agriculture. The functional group consists of a sulfonyl group (-S(=O)2) with its sulphur atom bonded to a nitrogen atom of a ureylene group (N,N-dehydrourea, a dehydrogenated derivative of urea). The side chains R1 and R2 distinguish various sulfonylureas. Sulfonylureas are the most widely used herbicide.

==Agricultural uses==
Many sulfonylureas are also used as herbicides, because they can interfere with plant biosynthesis of certain amino acids.

As herbicides sulfonylureas function by interfering with biosynthesis of the amino acids valine, isoleucine, and leucine, specifically via acetolactate synthase inhibition. Compounds in this class include amidosulfuron, azimsulfuron, bensulfuron-methyl, chlorimuron-ethyl, chlorsulfuron, ethametsulfuron-methyl, cinosulfuron, ethoxysulfuron, flazasulfuron, flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium, imazosulfuron, metsulfuron-methyl, nicosulfuron, oxasulfuron, primisulfuron-methyl, prosulfuron, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, rimsulfuron, sulfometuron-methyl, sulfosulfuron, thifensulfuron-methyl, triasulfuron, tribenuron-methyl, and triflusulfuron-methyl. These are broad-spectrum herbicides that kill plants weeds or pests by inhibiting the enzyme acetolactate synthase. In the 1960s, more than crop protection chemical was typically applied, while sulfonylureates allow as little as 1% as much material to achieve the same effect.

==Medical uses==
===Treatment of type 2 diabetes===
They are widely used as antidiabetic drugs in the management of diabetes mellitus type 2. They act by increasing secretion of insulin from the beta cells in the pancreas.

Sulfonylureas are ineffective where there is absolute deficiency of insulin production such as in type 1 diabetes or post-pancreatectomy.

Sulfonylureas can be used to treat some types of neonatal diabetes. Historically, people with hyperglycemia and low blood insulin levels were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes by default, but it has been found that patients who receive this diagnosis before 6 months of age are often candidates for receiving sulfonylureas rather than insulin throughout life.

A 2011 Cochrane systematic review evaluated the effects on treatment of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) and found that Sulfonylureas did not improve metabolic control of glucose at 3 and 12 months, even worsening HbA1c levels in some cases, when compared to insulin. The same review did not find improvement of fasting C-peptide following treatment with sulfonylurea. Still, it is important to highlight that the studies available to be included in this review presented considerable flaws in quality and design.

While prior sulfonylureas were associated with worse outcomes, newer agents do not appear to increase the risk of death, heart attacks, or strokes. This is further reinforced by a 2020 Cochrane systematic review which did not find enough evidence of reduction of all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or end-stage renal disease when comparing metformin monotherapy to sulfonylureas. This same review also did not find improvement in health-related quality of life.

In individuals with impaired-glucose tolerance, a 2019 systematic review only found one suitable trial comparing the effects of Sulphonylurea with metformin in reduction or delay of risk of developing type 2 diabetes, however this trial did not report patient-relevant outcomes. Another systematic review completed in the same year suggested that there is limited evidence if the combined used of Metformin with Sulphonylurea compared to the combination of Metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention, provides benefit or harm in mortality, severe adverse events, macrovascular and microvascular complications. Combined Metformin and Sulphonylurea therapy did appear to lead to higher risk of Hypoglycemia.

===Interleukin-1 β inhibitors===
Sulfonylureas are also used experimentally to inhibit release of interleukin 1 beta from the NALP3 (or NLRP3) inflammasome.

===Side effects===
Sulfonylureas – as opposed to metformin, the thiazolidinediones, pramlintide and other newer treatments – may induce hypoglycemia as a result of excesses in insulin production and release. Hypoglycemia appears to happen more often with sulfonylureas than compared to other treatments. This typically occurs if the dose is too high, and the patient is fasting. Some people attempt to change eating habits to prevent this, however it can be counterproductive.

Like insulin, sulfonylureas can induce weight gain, mainly as a result of their effect to increase insulin levels and thus use of glucose and other metabolic fuels. Other side-effects are: gastrointestinal upset, headache and hypersensitivity reactions.

The safety of sulfonylurea therapy in pregnancy is unestablished. Prolonged hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in children borne to mothers taking sulfonylureas at the time of delivery. Impairment of liver or kidney function increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and are contraindications. Since other antidiabetic drugs cannot be used either under these circumstances, insulin therapy is typically recommended during pregnancy and in liver and kidney failure, although some of the newer agents offer potentially better options.

A 2011 Cochrane review found evidence that treatment of LADA using sulfonylureas lead to earlier insulin dependence in approximately 30% of cases.

A 2014 Cochrane review found tentative evidence that people treated with sulfonylureas have fewer non-fatal cardiovascular events than those treated with metformin (RR 0.7) but a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (RR 5.6). There was not enough data available to determine the risk of mortality or of cardiovascular mortality. An earlier review by the same group found a statistically significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular death for first generation sulfonylureas relative to placebo (RR 2.6) but there was not enough data to determine the relative risk of first generation sulfonylureas relative to insulin (RR 1.4). Likewise it was not possible to determine the relative mortality risk of second generation sulfonylureas relative to metformin (RR 1.0), insulin (RR 1.0), or placebo. The FDA requires sulfonylureas to carry a label warning regarding increased risk of cardiovascular death.

A 2020 Cochrane systematic review comparing metformin monotherapy to sulfonylureas did not find enough evidence of reduction of all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or end-stage renal disease.

Second-generation sulfonylureas have increased potency by weight, compared to first-generation sulfonylureas. Similarly, ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) and the VADT (Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial) studies showed no reduction in heart attack or death in patients assigned to tight glucose control with various drugs.

=== Interactions ===

Drugs that potentiate or prolong the effects of sulfonylureas and therefore increase the risk of hypoglycemia include acetylsalicylic acid and derivatives, allopurinol, sulfonamides, and fibrates. Drugs that worsen glucose tolerance, contravening the effects of antidiabetics, include corticosteroids, isoniazid, oral contraceptives and other estrogens, sympathomimetics, and thyroid hormones. Sulfonylureas tend to interact with a wide variety of other drugs, but these interactions, as well as their clinical significance, vary from substance to substance.

== Structure ==
Sulfonylureas contain a central &quot;S&quot;-arylsulfonylurea structure with a &quot;p&quot;-substituent on the phenyl ring (R1) and various groups terminating the urea &quot;N&quot; end group (R2). Chemically, this functionality can be easily installed by reacting aryl sulfonamides (R1—C6H4—SO2NH2) with isocyanates (R2—NCO).

===Classification===
Sulfonylureas are divided into 3 classes on basis of therapeutic efficiency of their antidiabetic action:
* First-generation drugs:
They include acetohexamide, carbutamide, chlorpropamide, glycyclamide (tolcyclamide), metahexamide, tolazamide and tolbutamide.
* Second-generation drugs:
They include glibenclamide (glyburide), glibornuride, gliclazide, glipizide, gliquidone, glisoxepide and glyclopyramide.
* Third-generation drugs:
They include glimepiride, although it is sometimes considered a second-generation drug.

===Mechanism of action===
Sulfonylureas bind to and close ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells, which depolarizes the cell by preventing potassium from exiting. This depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granules with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of mature insulin.

There is some evidence that sulfonylureas also sensitize β-cells to glucose, that they limit glucose production in the liver, that they decrease lipolysis (breakdown and release of fatty acids by adipose tissue) and decrease clearance of insulin by the liver.

The KATP channel is an octameric complex of the inward-rectifier potassium ion channel Kir6.x and sulfonylurea receptor SUR which associate with a stoichiometry of 4:4.

Furthermore, it has been shown that sulfonylureas interact with the nucleotide exchange factor Epac2. Mice lacking this factor exhibited a decreased glucose-lowering effect upon sulfonylurea treatment.

===History===
Sulfonylureas were discovered in 1942, by the chemist Marcel Janbon and co-workers in France, who were studying sulfonamide antibiotics and discovered that the compound sulfonylurea induced hypoglycemia in animals.

Research and development (translational research and commercial application development) for sulfonylureas as pharmaceuticals (as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in prediabetes and diabetes) happened in the 1950s and 1960s, as explored at &quot;Tolbutamide § History&quot;.

Research and development (translational research and commercial application development) for sulfonylureas as herbicides happened in the 1970s and 1980s, as explored for example in a volume of the Sloan Technology Series focusing on the sociotechnological aspects of agriculture (Canine 1995); the DuPont Experimental Station led this development.

<text>Ocuituco is a town in the Mexican state of Morelos and the municipal head for the Municipality of Ocuituco which includes the towns of Ocuituco, Huejotengo, Huecahuaxco, Huepalcalco, Metepec, and Ocoxaltepec, as well as a number of settlements with fewer than 300 inhabitants. The name comes from Nahuatl &quot;Okuiltoco&quot; and means &quot;Where there are weevils.&quot; It is one of the 36 municipalities of the state of Morelos. To the north of Ocuitico is México State, southeast is Zacualpan, east is Tetela del Volcán, and southwest is Yecapixtla.
It stands at , at 1,920 meters above sea level. It is considered one of the municipalities of the &quot;Los altos de Morelos&quot; (Morelos highlands).
==History==
During Pre-Hispanic times, Ocuituco was inhabited by Olmecs-Xicalancas, and after the Spanish Conquest, Hernan Cortés received the submission of the Cacique of Ocuituco. During the Colonial era, Ocuituco was one of the few towns subtracted from the Marquessate of the valley of Oaxaca and was commissioned to Fray Juan de Zumarraga in the year of 1548, as a means of financing the traveling expenses of the monks arriving from Spain. At a later time, the town of Jumiltepec was used for this purpose.

After the historical siege of Cuautla in 1812, José María Morelos y Pavón took to the town of Ocuituco to regroup his forces, and then to Chiautla, where he defeated the Spanish chief París.

Ocuituco was one of the most severely affected municipalities during the September 19, 2017 earthquake. 74 people died in Morelos including several in the Ocuituco. 529 homes were destroyed and another 511 were damaged in the municipality.

Juan Jesus Anzures Garcia of Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018. One of the biggest concerns is the high rate of crime and violence.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; six cases were reported in Ocuituco. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On June 2, Ocuituco reported 15 confirmed cases and two deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Ocuituco reported 34 cases, 28 recuperations, and five deaths from the virus as of August 31. Sixty-six cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

==Population==
The municipality reported 18,580 inhabitants in the year 2015 census. Fewer than 1% speak a native indigenous language.

==Geography==
Ocuitico has a semi-warm sub-humid climate, with rains starting in summer (From June to October), with medium humidity (75.16%).

Over 70% of the economy consists of agricultural activities, mainly for corn, peaches, and avocados.

==Communities==
&quot;Ocuituco&quot; is the municipal seat. It has 4,846 inhabitants and stands at 1,919 meters above sea level. There are three preschools, two elementary schools (grades 1−6), one middle school (grades 7−9), and one high school (grades 10−12). Sister city: Pharr, Texas

<doc id="732124" wikidata="Q2578430" url="?curid=732124" title="Battle of Svensksund">
<text>The Second Battle of Svensksund (; ) was a naval battle fought in the Gulf of Finland outside the present day city of Kotka on 9 and 10 July 1790. The Swedish naval forces dealt the Russian fleet a devastating defeat that brought an end to the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790). The battle is the biggest Swedish naval victory and the largest naval battle ever in the Baltic Sea. It qualifies among the largest naval battles in history in terms of the number of vessels involved.

==Background==
Circumstances in the 1780s, including the war between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, and the moving of a portion of the Russian Baltic Fleet to the Black Sea, prompted the Swedish king, Gustav III, to attack Russia in 1788. The war was also initiated to distract domestic attention from political problems and for Gustav III to be able to fulfill his role as a successful and powerful monarch.

Gustav&#x27;s main aim was to recapture some of the territory in Finland that had been lost to the Russians in the war of 1741–43. In 1788, he launched a surprise attack against the Russian fleet. The plan was to attack Kronstadt and land a force to assault the capital, St Petersburg.

The war was intended to be short and to be won by the assault on St Petersburg, conducted by the navy and &quot;skärgårdsflottan&quot; (the &quot;archipelago fleet&quot;). The latter, officially designated as &quot;arméns flotta&quot; (&quot;fleet of the army&quot;) was a separate branch of the armed forces designed for coastal operations and amphibious warfare in the Baltic. Since its formation in 1756, it had been something of an elite force within the Swedish armed forces. However, after the Battle of Hogland (1788) (a tactical tie but a strategic failure for the Swedes) Gustav lost the initiative and tensions in Sweden rose. The First Battle of Svensksund on 24 August 1789 ended in a Swedish defeat.

==Prelude==

In 1790 an attempt to assault Vyborg failed, and the Swedish Navy along with King Gustav himself, was caught in the Bay of Viborg. It managed to escape through the &quot;Viborg gauntlet&quot; on 3 July, though with heavy losses to the deep-sea navy. After retreating to Svensksund, King Gustav made a decision to make a stand there. The Swedish coastal fleet was reinforced by 40 ships under Lieutenant-Colonel Carl Olof Cronstedt after the escape from Vyborg. Gustav made the decision to lead the fight personally and divided his forces into four brigades under lieutenant-colonels Carl Olof Cronstedt, Claes Hjelmstjerna, Victor von Stedingk, and Jakob Törning. Von Stedingk was to lead the center consisting of two &quot;hemmema&quot; (&quot;Styrbjörn&quot; and &quot;Starkotter&quot;) and two &quot;udema&quot; (&quot;Torborg&quot; and &quot;Ingeborg&quot;) archipelago frigates, brig &quot;Alexander&quot;, 15 galleys, two half-galleys, and 11 cannon or mortar longboats. Törning had the command of the right wing consisting of 39 gun sloops and 22 gun yawls while Hjelmstierna&#x27;s left wing had 30 gun sloops and 14 gun yawls supported by 12 gun sloops and yawls from Cronstedt&#x27;s brigade. The rest of Cronstedt&#x27;s brigade, consisting of the &quot;turuma&quot; &quot;Norden&quot;, one galley and 36 gun sloops and yawls, was to remain in reserve and guard against a possible Russian flanking maneuver. Artillery batteries were constructed on the skerries of Kråkskär (between the center and right wings) and Sandskär (between the center and left wings). On 8 July the preparations were completed.

The Russian coastal fleet consisted of nine archipelago frigates, 13 &quot;xebec&quot;s, two mortar ships, four gun prams, three floating batteries, 26 galleys, six schooners, four cutters, 77 gun sloops and 121 lightly armed boats. The Russian fleet carried around 900 cannons compared to 450 Swedish cannons and had clear superiority in both number of ships and men. The Russian coastal fleet was eager to attack, especially on 9 July, the anniversary of Catherine the Great&#x27;s proclamation as Empress of Russia. Recognizing the failure to decisively defeat the Swedish archipelago fleet a year earlier at the same location, the Russian commander, Prince Charles of Nassau-Siegen, chose to commit his whole force from the south. This was done to prevent the Swedes from escaping to the shelter of Svartholm fortress since Nassau-Siegen was expecting a clear victory, having numerical superiority in ships, artillery as well as in men.

On the morning of 9 July Gustav III suddenly named Lieutenant-Colonel Cronstedt as his flag-captain after relieving Colonel George de Frese from his duties. The reason for this sudden change was likely that de Frese had been in favor of withdrawing from Svensksund to a more favorable location while Cronstedt had advocated fighting the Russians at Svensksund.

==Battle==
At 08:00 on 9 July the Russian flagship signaled the attack. By 09:30 the first ships had reached firing distance in the western flank but soon after fighting spread throughout the battle lines. The Swedish right wing under Lieutenant Colonel Törning met with increasing resistance as the Russian left wing opposing him was reinforced. However, the Swedes were able to move ships from their reserves to support their right wing with a counterattack which managed to lead the Russian left wing into disorder. Meanwhile, an increasingly strong southwesterly wind forced the Russian center deeper between converging Swedish lines. The strong winds also made it difficult for the Russians to aim their guns, a problem affecting the Swedish ships much less, as the Russian ships acted as a wavebreaker in front of them.

After no Russian ships were seen approaching from Frederikshamn, the Swedes were able to release more ships from their reserves to bolster the Swedish left wing led by Lieutenant Colonel Hjelmstierna. Half of Hjelmstierna&#x27;s ships were sent to the rear of the Russian fleet through a narrow passage between Legma and Kutsalö which in turn forced the Russian right wing to deploy accordingly. However, movement to the back of the line was read as a signal to withdraw by the Russian left wing which started its retreat leaving the Russian center to face the Swedes alone.
By the evening it had become apparent that the Swedes were victorious even though the Russian center, consisting of their galleys and largest ships, continued to fight despite unfavorable winds and battle damage. At this time the Swedes were able to fire at the Russian ships from the front as well as from both sides and several Russian ships started drifting into the Swedish battle line. Other Russian ships caught fire or were intentionally set on fire, while a few were beached to avoid sinking. At 20:00 Naussau-Siegen ordered the Russian fleet to withdraw and to destroy drifting Russian ships in order to keep them from being captured. Strong winds made the withdrawal difficult and several ships failed to escape. A few Russian ships ignored the order to withdraw and instead kept fighting until they sank. Fighting did not end until 22:00. The wind calmed down during the night and several Russian ships tried to escape under the cover of darkness but Swedish gun sloops and yawls were sent to hunt them down, and this fighting continued until 09:00 on the morning of 10 July 1790.

The Russians lost at least 7,400 of 14,000 men; 1,400 dead, wounded and 6,000 captured, compared with Swedish losses of one udema, five minor vessels and 300 men; others place the number of dead and wounded Swedes to around 600. Among the Russian ships that were lost were 10 &quot;archipelago frigates&quot; (sail/oar hybrids) and &quot;xebecs&quot;, nine half-&quot;xebecs&quot; (schooners), 16 galleys, four gun prams and floating batteries, seven bomb vessels, five gun sloops and several other small vessels. Along with 21 other ships the Swedes captured the &quot;Catarina&quot;, Nassau-Siegen&#x27;s flagship.

The battle of Svensksund is the biggest naval battle ever fought in the Baltic Sea: 500 ships (including supply ships and other ships not involved in combat), over 30,000 men and several thousand cannons. At Svensksund, the Swedes boasted that they destroyed 40 percent of the Russian coastal fleet.

==Aftermath==

Surviving Russian ships gathered at Frederikshamn where the badly depleted fleet was being rebuilt while the Swedish coastal fleet stayed at Svensksund. The Swedes later sent a squadron of 25 gun sloops closer to Frederikshamn but they were turned back on 5 August by the rebuilt Russian coastal fleet. The Swedes withdrew back to Svensksund but the Russians did not give chase.

This defeat encouraged Russia to negotiate with Sweden, eventually signing the Treaty of Värälä on 14 August 1790. Neither side gained any territory, however all provisions in the peace treaty of Nystad from 1721 that formally infringed upon Swedish sovereignty were cancelled. After the war the Russians started a massive fortification programme on the eastern, Russian, side of the Kymi river, building the sea fortresses Fort Slava, Fort Elisabeth and the land fortress Kyminlinna. The forts later grew into the port city of Kotka.

==Sankt Nikolai==
The Russian frigate &quot;Sankt Nikolai&quot; was sunk in the battle. She was found in 1948 off Kotka, almost intact. Over 2,300 objects have been recovered from her hull by divers.

<text>Puente de Ixtla is a city in the Mexican state of Morelos. It stands at .
The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality reported 66,435 inhabitants in the year 2015 census.

The town gets its name from a 16th-century bridge (&quot;Puente&quot;) and &quot;Ixtla&quot;, which comes from Nahuatl &quot;its&quot; (obsidian) and &quot;tla&quot; (abundance), meaning &quot;Place where obsidian abounds&quot;.

== History ==
Puente de Ixtla belonged to the seigniory of Cuauhnahuac and was thus tributary of the Aztecs. Prehispanic ruins have been found near the Church of San Mateo Apostol.

A stone bridge was constructed over the Rio Chalma and the village became a place of required passage for the caravans from Acapulco to Mexico City. Legend has it that members of the Jesuits secretly buried a treasure in a cave near the &quot;ranchería&quot; (English: settlement) of Cacahuananche in 1767, the year the religious order was expelled from Nueva España.

A strong earthquake on April 7, 1845, did considerable damage in Puente de Ixtla and may have been responsible for the flooding of the village of Tequesquitengo, Jojutla.

With the creation of the Morelos in 1869, Puente de Ixtla was one of the already existing municipalities.
July 12, 1871: annexation of the villages of Xoxocotla, Tehuixtla and of the hacienda of San Jose Vista Hermosa; later, Xoxocotla was attached to the municipality of Jojutla. The town Xoxocotla is scheduled to become an independent municipality on January 1, 2019.

Between 1913 and 1914 the population of Puente de Ixtla was evacuated because of the Revolution. One of the marks of the revolution is missing in the belfry of the Church of &quot;San Mateo&quot;, which was collapsed by a cannonball.

On Monday, April 26, 1920, President Álvaro Obregón, traveling from Iguala, met Francisco Cossio Robelo from Cuernavaca in Puente de Ixtla. This essentially ended the Mexican Revolution in the south of Mexico.
The Puente Chalma over the Chalma River along the Cuernavaca-Iguala tollway collapsed on July 26, 2014. Two cars fell into the river and three people were injured.

Morelos suffered significant damage in the September 7, 2017 earthquake, and seventy-four people were killed in the September 19 earthquake. 23,000 buildings were damaged in the state, including 293 homes destroyed and 816 damaged in Puente de Ixtla.

Mario Ocampo Ocampo of &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018. When City Hall failed to pay MXN $1,3000,000 (US $66,540) to a disabled police officer in September 2019, an administrative court judge (&quot;Tribunal de Justicia Administrativa&quot;) ordered the mayor, trustee, and councilors to all step down for three years.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; four cases were reported in Puente de Ixtla. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On June 2, Puente de Ixtla reported 74 confirmed cases and 13 deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. One hundred seventy-five cases were reported on December 27, 2020. On February 24 Puente de Ixtla became the second municipality (after Temixco) in Morelos to vaccinate senior citizens (60+).

The &quot;Brigada Nacional de Búsqueda&quot; (National Search Brigade), composed of relatives of missing persons, found human remains along the Cuernavaca-Iguala tollway in Puente de Ixtla in July 2020 while on its first excursion into Morelos. The municipality has been under the scourge of several violent gangs, and many people are afraid of reporting them to the police.

===Hacienda de San José Vista Hermosa===
This 16th-century hacienda founded by Hernán Cortés is now a luxury restaurant/hotel with 105 rooms.

Established in the 16th century, the hacienda was sold by Pedro Cortés Ramírez de Arellano, grandson of the conqueror, in 1621, to Fray de Dios Guerrero. In the early 18th century, the hacienda was sold to &quot;Gabriel Yermo&quot; who in 1820 sold it to &quot;Manuel Vicente Vidal&quot;, being owned by this family until 1910, when the Mexican Revolution broke out. Emiliano Zapata took over the hacienda, burned alcohol, and distributed sugar among the peasants. The hacienda was restored and the hotel opened in 1945.

Villagers and local authorities in Tequesquitengo, Jojutla claim that the village was flooded by the Mosso brothers, who – according to Alfonso Toussaint – owned the San José Vista Hermosa hacienda in the mid-19th century (Mentz, et al, Haciendas de Morelos, Instituto de Cultura de Morelos, National Council for Culture and the Arts, Mexico, 1997), forming Lake Tequesquitengo.

<text>Temixco is the fourth-largest city in the Mexican state of Morelos. It is in the west-northwest part of the state, from Cuernavaca and from Mexico City.

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality, with which it shares a name. The municipality reported 116,143 inhabitants in 2010, a growth rate of 1.5% for each of the previous ten years. The municipality has an area of .

==History==
===Prehispanic History===

The area around Xochicalco (In the place of the House of Flowers) was settled in about 200 BCE, although the city reached its apex between AD 650 and 900. Xochicalco was mentioned by Fray Bernardino de Sahagún in the 16th century, and it may have been settled by refugees from Teotihuacan. The city traded with populations in Oaxaca, the Yucatán Peninsula, and the Gulf of Mexico. According to petrographs found in the &quot;Templo de las Serpientes Emplumadas&quot;, (Temple of the Feathered Serpents) Xochicalco hosted a meeting with representatives from the Maya area, the Gulf Coast, and Oaxaca to adjust the calendar during a solar eclipse while Xochicalco was at its splendor.

In about A.D. 830, the Nahuatl-speaking emigrated to the area south of the mountains of Ajusco, in what is the state of Morelos today. At the time of the formation of the Triple Alliance (1428), the only communities in the modern-day municipality of Temixco were &quot;Acatlipa&quot; and &quot;Cuentepec&quot;.

===Colonial Era===

After the Spanish conquest of 1521, Hernán Cortés was granted the title Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca including almost all of modern Morelos. The villages of Temixco were Acatlipa, San Agustín Tetlama, and San Sebastián Cuentepec.

Martín Cortés, 2nd Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca granted lands to religious orders and wealthy Spanish were able to establish the first sugar-cane plantations or &quot;haciendas&quot;. On July 29. 1617, Don Francisco Barbero of Copaltepeque established the &quot;Hacienda of Temixco&quot; on 1,755 hectares of land. Later, additional land was purchased from the native peoples. The first installation was the sugar press (&quot;trapiche&quot;), and at the beginning of the 18th century, it became an &quot;ingenio&quot; for production of sugar, rum, alcohol and other products. Other small presses were established at &quot;Rivas&quot;, &quot;Tomalaca&quot;, and &quot;San José&quot;. The hacienda took the name &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Concepción&quot; (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception).

The owner of the hacienda, Miguel de Zia, seized land in Xochitepec and Alpuyeca in 1715 with the support of Fray Simón Roa of the Holy Inquisition. In 1719 the people of these communities complained, but Xochitepec never recovered its land. Indigenous of Alpuyeca rose against the hacienda in 1747, only to be arrested by Fray Miguel de Nava of Cuernavaca.

===19th Century===

In 1808, don Gabriel Joaquín de Yermo celebrated his wife&#x27;s birthday by freeing 200 slaves from his hacienda in Temixco. This is why so few Black people participated in the Independence movement of 1810 but took the side of the Spanish.

Yermo led the September 15, 1808 &quot;golpe de estado&quot; (French &amp; English: &quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot;) against Viceroy José de Iturrigaray, who was replaced the following day by Viceroy Pedro de Garibay, ending the criollos&#x27; &quot;Patriotas de Fernando VII&quot; attempt to legally achieve independence. When the Mexican War of Independence broke out in 1810, Gabriel Joaquín de Yermo converted the hacienda into a supply center for the Royalists.

The State of Mexico was created in 1824, and the District of Cuernavaca was formed. The hacienda of Temixco was included in the municipality of Xochitepec within the District of Cuernavaca. Temixco became part of the State of Morelos when it was formed on April 17, 1869.

===20th Century===

There were two battles in the hacienda of Temixco in 1914. The first was on May 26, when the Zapatistas was able to take the hacienda, and the second was in early June when the Zapatistas used the hacienda as a staging ground for the Siege of Cuernavaca. In 1915, once the Zapatistas took control of Mexico City, they confiscated all the ruined alcohol distilleries. Gral. Genovevo de la O was assigned to get Temixco running again.

In 1921 Temixco was elevated to the category of &quot;Congregación&quot; and the town took the name &quot;Real de Temixco&quot;. It was part of the municipality of Cuernavaca. The Ejido de Temixco was formed in 1924.

The Municipality of Temixco was created on March 5, 1933, including the towns of Tetlama, Cuentepec, Acatlipa, and Temixco.
On December 8, 1935, the &quot;Pueblo Nuevo del Puente (Alta Palmira)&quot; was established in Cuernavaca. In 1956 it was transferred to Temixco.

In the 1940s the &quot;Comité Japonés de Ayuda Mutua&quot; (CJAM; &quot;Japanese Committee of Mutual Aid&quot;), a Japanese-Mexican organization based in Mexico City, obtained a hacienda on of land in Temixco from Alejandro Lacy so it could house newly-arriving Japanese coming from other parts of Mexico. In 1942, during World War II, the hacienda of Temixco became a concentration camp. The Japanese had moved in by 1943. A school for Japanese students was established in Temixco to serve those on the hacienda. Eventually, Mexican parents began asking for their children to attend the Temixco Japanese school.

The Hacienda of Temixco continued to cultivate sugar cane until 1968 when it became a water park. Today it includes swimming pools, a wave pool, a river, and athletic fields.

Due to migration from other states, the population of Temixco grew quickly in the 1970s, and new colonies such as Rubén Jaramillo, Lomas de Guadalupe, 10 de Abril, and La Azteca were added. The town of &quot;Pueblo Viejo&quot; which previously belonged to Cuernavaca, became a part of Temixco in 1990.

The General Mariano Matamoros Airport opened on April 15, 1988 under control of the State of Morelos and came under federal control in 1992.

Temixco was elevated to the status of &quot;ciudad&quot; (city) on March 7, 1990.

===21st Century===

Construction on a bridge to connect Mexican Federal Highway 95D in Apatlaco, Ayala and the Cuernavaca Airport in Temixco was begun in 2012 and the project ended in November 2012. As of this writing (April 2019), the bridge is incomplete and there is no connection to Temixco.

Temixco has been plagued by violence during much of the 21st century. Mayor Gisela Mota Ocampo was shot outside her home on January 2, 2016. She died a few months later and was replaced by Irma Camacho García from 2016 to 2018. Camacho García had a tumultuous rule, becoming ill and dying six months later from cardiorespiratory arrest in July 2017. Then, a battle between rival drug gangs on November 30, 2017, left six dead, including a baby. In 2020, Gambia Lozano, who worked for the presidency of Enrique Peña Nieto, and four members of his family were murdered by the Colombian drug cartel &quot;El Señorón&quot; in May 2020.

Jazmin Juana Solano Lopez of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (municipal president) in the 2018 Mexican general election.

The Canadian firm Alamos Gold proposed an open-pit gold mine in Tetlama in 2020.

Morelos had its first case of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico in mid-March, about the same time that Mexico entered Phase 2 of the pandemic and schools were closed. The National Guard was called for its help in closing swimming pools in condominiums. Three hundred eighty-three cases were reported on December 27, 2020. After health workers were vaccinated, on February 17 Temixco became the first municipality in Morelos to vaccinate senior citizens (60+) with 15,170 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine.

<text>The Grote Kerk or St.-Bavokerk is a Reformed Protestant church and former Catholic cathedral located on the central market square (Grote Markt) in the Dutch city of Haarlem. Another Haarlem church called the Cathedral of Saint Bavo now serves as the main cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Haarlem-Amsterdam.

==History==

This church is an important landmark for the city of Haarlem and has dominated the city skyline for centuries. It is built in the Gothic style of architecture, and it became the main church of Haarlem after renovations in the 15th century made it significantly larger than the Janskerk (Haarlem). First mention of a church on this spot was made in 1307, but the wooden structure burned in the 14th century. The church was rebuilt and promoted to chapter church in 1479 and only became a cathedral in 1559. The main architects were Godevaert de Bosscher and Steven van Afflighem (nave), and Evert van Antwerpen (transept). The term &quot;cathedral&quot; was never really associated with this church, since it was only consecrated as a cathedral in 1559, which was already in the middle of the period known as the Protestant Reformation. The church was confiscated only 19 years later during the &quot;Haarlemse noon&quot; in 1578, when it was converted to Protestantism. It was dedicated to Saint Bavo at some time before 1500, though there exists a curious painting in the collection of the Catholic Cathedral of St. Bavo illustrating the miracle of St. Bavo saving Haarlem from the Kennemers in a scene from the 13th century. This painting was painted a century after the Catholics were banned from their church, and may have been a commemorative painting referring to the defense of the Church and the Catholic faith as well as the defense of the city.

===Christianity in Haarlem===
Haarlem has had a Christian parish church since the 9th century. This first church was a &quot;daughter church&quot; of Velsen, which itself was founded in 695 by St. Willibrord. This early first church was a wooden church on the same site of the current Sint-Bavokerk. Extensions and expansions over the centuries led to its formal consecration in 1559 when the first bishop Nicolaas van Nieuwland was appointed. Only 19 years later, after the Spanish occupation ended (they won the Siege of Haarlem) and Haarlem reverted to the Protestant House of Orange, the church was confiscated during the episode known as the &quot;Haarlemse noon&quot; and converted to Protestantism as part of the Protestant Reformation.

At this time most of the art and silver artefacts were also seized and what was not sold or destroyed has survived in the Haarlem municipal collection, which is now in the collection of the Frans Hals Museum. The Haarlem Catholics took what they could carry with them and went underground, meeting thereafter in various &quot;schuilkerken&quot;, the most prominent ones known as the &quot;St. Franciscus statie&quot; and the &quot;St. Josephs statie&quot;. Eventually, the St. Josephstatie built a new church across from the Janskerk called the St. Josephkerk, and this church, after growing and becoming a cathedral again, built a new cathedral on the Leidsevaart in the 19th century. Since the building of this new &quot;Cathedral of St. Bavo&quot;, there has been much confusion about the name of the Bavochurch, since as a Protestant church it is not even dedicated to Saint Bavo. For this reason it is officially called &quot;Grote Kerk&quot;, which just means &quot;Big Church&quot;.

===Fires===
On May 22, 1801, there was a fire caused by lightning which struck the tower. Another disaster was prevented in 1839 by Martijn Hendrik Kretschman, the guard of the tower. He stopped Jan Drost who worked for the church. Drost had tried to set fire to the pipe organ and piano by throwing hot coals on top of it. Drost committed suicide and he was buried in the tower.

In the church was a high sentry box reserved for fire-watchers. If they saw a fire in the city then they would signal using red flags so that the guards in the main guard house opposite could react. This sentry position was still in use in 1919.

In the renovation of the 1930s an automatic sprinkler system was installed in the tower, that could extinguish a fire 70m high in the tower.

==Exterior==
Though the exterior of the church seems timeless, it changed twice in the past 500 years; once when all statuary was removed from the outer niches during the &quot;Haarlemse Noon&quot;, and the second time in the late 19th century when a &quot;more Gothic look&quot; was given to the church by adding some fake ramparts to the roof edge. This can be seen easily when comparing pictures made before and afterwards.

Around the church various low buildings have been built up against it, most notably the former fish market called De Vishal, which today is used for exhibiting modern art. On the south side a series of low buildings used as shops are built up against various church buildings such as the former &quot;librye&quot; or library, and sacristy. In 1630 the architect Salomon de Bray designed and built the which still exists today.

==Interior==
The interior of the church has also changed little over the years, though the inner chapels suffered greatly during the Beeldenstorm, and many stained-glass windows have been lost to neglect. Fortunately, the interior has been painted many times by local painters, most notably by Pieter Jansz Saenredam and the Berckheyde brothers. Based on these paintings, work has been done to reconstruct the interior so various items such as &quot;rouwborden&quot; or &quot;mourning shields&quot; hang again today in their &quot;proper&quot; place.

===Stained glass windows===

The stained glass windows of the Bavo have suffered through the years from neglect. It is hard to imagine that Haarlem was an important center for stained glass art in the 16th century, since so little evidence of it still exists in Haarlem. After the Reformation, Haarlem promoted the stories of the &quot;Damiaatjes&quot; and the associated &quot;Wapenvermeerdering&quot; and produced many windows with this central story, which it presented as a gift to other churches and town halls. Today the original Haarlem gift by Willem Thibaut still hangs in the Janskerk (Gouda) as designed. That window gives an impression of the type of window that once hung in the Western wall. When the famous Muller organ was installed, the glass on the west side of the church (now only known to us from the painting by the local painter Job Berckheyde) with the &quot;Wapenvermeerdering&quot;, was dismantled and bricked up. The sketches for this glass have survived and are in the possession of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and were drawn by Barend van Orley.

In the church today, the lack of historic colorful windows has been made up for by installing windows from other, demolished or defunct churches, while modern artists have created new themes. A beautiful large blue window hanging on the northern side greets the visitor who enters through the double doors on the Groenmarkt. This window was made to personify peace and harmony, and was made by the local glass artist Michel van Overbeeke, who received a local prize of culture for this in 2009 (&quot;De Olifant&quot;).
==Organ==

The organ of the Sint-Bavokerk (the &quot;Christiaan Müller&quot; organ) is one of the world&#x27;s most historically important organs. It was built by the Amsterdam organ builder Christian Müller, with stucco decorations by the Amsterdam artist Jan van Logteren, between 1735 and 1738. Upon completion it was the largest organ in the world with 60 voices and 32-foot pedal-towers. In &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851), Herman Melville describes the inside of a whale&#x27;s mouth:
:&quot;Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand pipes?&quot;

Many famous musicians played this organ, including Mendelssohn, Händel and the 10-year-old Mozart, who played it in 1766. The organ was modified a number of times in the 19th and 20th centuries and most drastically altered in the renovation by Marcussen between 1959 and 1961. Further voicing work was undertaken between 1987 and 2000. Today concerts are regularly held in the church, and all through the year special opening times are organized so the public can walk in free of charge to listen to this famous organ in action.

A local story goes to say that the bass of the organ was so low, the mortar in between the brimstones started to brittle to nothing.

===Disposition===
* Couplers: I/II, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P

==Graves==
Until 1831 graves were allowed in the church, and many illustrious Haarlemmers through the centuries are buried there. Often people were buried under family gravestones, and the family shields of illustrious families are mounted on diamond shaped &quot;plaques&quot; hanging on the walls. Other illustrious Haarlemmers were buried in individual graves such as the rich Pieter Teyler van der Hulst and Willem van Heythuisen. The painters Maarten van Heemskerck (as a former church koster, he is buried in the kerstkapel), Frans Hals (who was buried in his first wife&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s grave, Nicolaes Ghyblant, but who received his own gravestone in 1962), Saenredam himself (in the South choir way near the entrance), and Jacob van Ruysdael and Salomon van Ruysdael. The two circus curiosities, the giant Daniel Cajanus with his midget friend Jan Paap, are buried there. The last burial there was for Willem Bilderdijk.

A local story is that under stone number 7 near the choir gate, there is a grave of a man who used to hit his mother as a child. After a time his hand started growing above his grave, and a copper plate had to be installed on the grave to stop the hand from growing.

There is also a story that only the rich could afford to be buried in the church. Regardless of wealth, the corpses rotted as they lay under the stone floor, producing a foul odor. This gave rise to the phrase &quot;Stinking Rich&quot;.

==Bells==
In 1429 the bells from the former parish church which was on the same spot where the &#x27;Grote Kerk&#x27; was built, were hung in a large wooden belfry (klokhuis) behind the choir close of the church. It was demolished in 1804, to strengthen the finances of the city council, and the bells were sold. In 1918, a smaller iron replica was built on the same spot by the firm of Joh. Enschede where the guilder billets were printed.

Today the Haarlem Grote Kerk tower is provided with a big bourdon bell from 1503 named Roeland, made by the Kampen bellfounder Geert van Wou. It sounds with tone A0 and has a weight of approx. 4900 kg This biggest bell in the tower strikes the hour. In 1662 François Hemony from Amsterdam made a carillon of 33 bells, later it was enlarged by his brother Pieter Hemony to 35 bells. In 1968 25 bells were recast by Eijsbouts in Asten, and it was expanded to a concert carillon of 47 bells. The carillon is tuned in meantone temperament based on Des1 (Dflat1). Since this restoration the old 25 bells by Hemony hang in the tower of the Bakenesserkerk also in Haarlem. In 2010, the Grote Kerk carillon was redesigned to improve the play ability. The city carillonneur plays the bells weekly on the market days and on Tuesday in the summer there is a concert just before the weekly organ concert played often by guest players. The city carillonneur also re-inserts the pins on the drum twice a year. The drum plays to announce the hour strike and all other quarters of the hour. In Haarlem there is also a very short tune on every seven and half minute. So the drum chimes eight times in the hour. Rien Donkersloot is appointed by the municipality of Haarlem as the city carillonneur of Haarlem.
According to the local legend known as the &quot;Wapenvermeerdering&quot;, or &quot;Legend of the Haarlem shield&quot;, the two upper bells in the tower were taken from Damiette (&quot;Damiate&quot; in Dutch) during the Fifth Crusade by Haarlem knights and were placed in the tower. In reality, they were a gift by Johannes Dircks, a bell-maker from Aalst to Nicolaas van Nieuwland, the bishop of Haarlem, in 1562. Since then the two bells were chimed every evening between 21:00 and 21:30 o&#x27;clock, to give a signal for closing the city gates. In 1732 the bells were recast, and installed, by Jan Albert de Grave a bellfounder from Amsterdam. Since Haarlem was no longer a &quot;vesting stad&quot; or walled city, the tradition of the bells continued, to commemorate the conquest of Damiette on August 25, 1219. The bells have names Piet and Hein.

<doc id="732131" wikidata="Q213507" url="?curid=732131" title="Djenné">
<text>Djenné (; also known as Djénné, Jenné, and Jenne) is a Songhai town and urban commune in the Inland Niger Delta region of central Mali. The town is the administrative centre of the Djenné Cercle, one of the eight subdivisions of the Mopti Region. The commune includes ten of the surrounding villages and in 2009 had a population of 32,944.

The history of Djenné is closely linked with that of Timbuktu. Between the 15th and 17th centuries much of the trans-Saharan trade in goods such as salt, gold, and slaves that moved in and out of Timbuktu passed through Djenné. Both towns became centres of Islamic scholarship. Djenné&#x27;s prosperity depended on this trade and when the Portuguese established trading posts on the African coast, the importance of the trans-Saharan trade and thus of Djenné declined.

The town is famous for its distinctive adobe architecture, most notably the Great Mosque which was built in 1907 on the site of an earlier mosque. To the south of the town is Djenné-Djenno, the site of one of the oldest known towns in sub-Saharan Africa. Djenné together with Djenné-Djenno were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.

==Geography==

Djenné is situated northeast of Bamako and southwest of Mopti. The town sits on the floodplain between the Niger and Bani rivers at the southern end of the Inland Niger Delta. The town has an area of around and during the annual floods becomes an island that is accessed by causeways. The Bani river is south of the town and is crossed by ferry.

For administrative purposes the town forms part of the commune of Djenné which covers an area of 302 square kilometers and consists of the town and ten of the surrounding villages: Ballé, Diabolo, Gomnikouboye, Kamaraga, Kéra, Niala, Soala, Syn, Velingara and Yenleda. The population figures are for the commune and include these villages. The commune is bounded to the north by the communes of Ouro Ali and Derary, to the south by the commune of Dandougou Fakala, to the east by the communes of Fakala and Madiama and to the west by the commune of Pondori. The town is the administrative center (&quot;chef-lieu&quot;) of the Djenné Cercle, one of eight administrative subdivisions of the Mopti Region.

===Climate===
The weather is hot and dry throughout much of the year. Average daily maximum temperatures in the hottest months, April and May, are around 40 °C. Temperatures are slightly cooler, though still very hot, from June through September, when practically all of the annual rainfall occurs. Only the winter months of December and January have average daily maximum temperatures below 32 °C. Between December and March the warm dry north-easterly Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara. When it blows strongly, the dust-laden wind reduces visibility and creates a persistent haze. The annual rainfall is around 550 mm but varies greatly from year to year. August is normally the wettest month.

===Annual flood===

In Djenné the annual flood produced by Bani and Niger rivers begins in July and reaches a maximum in October. During this period, the town of Djenné becomes an island and the Souman-Bani channel that passes just to the east of the town fills and connects the Bani and Niger rivers. The year-to-year variation in the height of the flood leads to a large variation in the area of land that is flooded. This has important consequences for the local agriculture. The drought that began in the early 1970s resulted in a big reduction in the volume of water flowing in the Niger and Bani rivers. The effect on the Bani was particularly severe as the reduction in flow was much greater than the reduction in rainfall. The annual discharge of the river has not returned to the volumes experienced in the 1950s and 1960s. It is only during the flood season (mid-July till December) that the Bani river between Djenné and Mopti is easily navigable. At other times of the year, sandbars lie close to the water surface. When the French explorer René Caillié made the journey to Mopti in a small boat in March 1828, he was &quot;obliged several times to unload the vessel in order to pass over sandbanks.&quot;

===Talo dam===

In 2006 the Talo Dam was constructed on the Bani River to irrigate parts of the floodplain near the town of San. The dam is located 43 km west of San and 110 km upstream from Djenné. The dam functions as a weir in that water can flow over the top of the retaining wall. The construction of the dam was highly controversial. The environmental impact assessment commissioned by the African Development Bank was criticised for not fully taking into account the hydrological impact downstream of the dam. The 0.18 km3 of water retained by the dam represents 1.3% of the average annual discharge of the river (the average for the period 1952–2002 is 13.4 km3). From the published information it is unclear how much of the total discharge will be diverted for irrigation and, of the diverted water, how much will drain back into the river. The downstream effect of the dam will be to delay the arrival of the annual flood and to reduce its intensity.

===Djenné dam===
In May 2009 the African Development Bank approved funding for an irrigation dam/weir to be built on the Bani near Soala, a village within the commune situated south of Djenné. The dam is one element in a 6-year 33.6 billion CFA franc (66 million USD) program that also includes the building of a dam on the Sankarani River near Kourouba and the extension of the area irrigated by the Talo dam. The proposed Djenné dam will retain 0.3 km3 of water, significantly more than the Talo dam. It will allow the &quot;controlled flooding&quot; of of the Pondori floodplain (on the left bank of the river to the south of Djenné) to allow the cultivation of rice and the irrigation of an additional for growing &#x27;floating grass&#x27; (&quot;Echinochloa stagnina&quot; known locally as &quot;bourgou&quot;) for animal feed.

==History==
===Djenné-Jeno===

Lying south-east of the present town is the archaeological site of Djenné-Djeno, meaning &#x27;old Djenne&#x27;, one of the earliest and most important urban sites in West Africa. The name of the town itself was Djoboro, and it was founded by Soninke immigrants from the Wagadou region during an increasingly dry period that made the Inner Niger Delta more habitable. Excavations undertaken by Susan and Roderick McIntosh in 1977 and 1981 indicate that Djenné-Jéno was first settled around 200 BC. Oral traditions recount a legendary founder named Maafir, who was from Yemen and descended from the Biblical and Quranic figure Esau. Djoboro developed into a large walled urban complex by between 300 and 850 AD. The city and its environs, including the later site of modern-day Djenne, had approximately 50,000 inhabitants. 25 chiefs ruled the city before the coming of Islam in the late 600s, although Siigha, the first Muslim ruler, is also presumably mythical, considering his supposed connections to companions of the prophet Muhammad. 

Preliminary archaeological excavations at sites within modern Djenné indicate that the present town was first settled after 1000 AD. Oral traditions, failing to distinguish between Djenne and Djoboro, claim that it was founded in 635 around the home of a powerful djinn, Shamharoush, who had been blessed by the prophet Muhammad. The name &#x27;Djenne&#x27; derives from &quot;jannah&quot;, the Islamic paradise.

After 1100 AD the population of Djenne-Djeno declined and by 1400 AD the site had been abandoned. Many smaller settlements within a few kilometres of Djenné-Jéno also appear to have been abandoned around this date. The cause of this demographic collapse is unknown, but may have included new diseases arriving in the area through trans-Saharan trade, or warfare. Djenne, however, was fully occupied, and survived as a center of regional trade.

===Mali Empire===
Djenne had a complicated relationship with the Mali Empire, which rose to power in the 13th century. Seventeenth century indigenous chronicles give conflicting accounts of the status of the town. Al-Sadi in his &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; claims that the Malians attacked the town ninety-nine times but that Djenné was never conquered while the other major chronicle, the &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot;, describes the chief of Djenné as a humble vassal of the Malian emperor. Djenné was probably a tribute-paying sometimes-vassal, with recurring episodes of conflict and commercial coercion pitting the city-state&#x27;s military and economic prowess against the powerful Malian state, which controlled most of the trade routes in the area. 

The first direct mention of Djenné in European sources is in connection with the trans-Saharan trade in gold, salt and slaves. In a letter written in Latin in 1447 by Antonio Malfante from the Saharan oasis of Tuwat to a merchant in Genoa, Malfante reports on what he had learnt from an informant about the trans-Saharan trade. He lists several &#x27;states&#x27; including one called &#x27;Geni&#x27; and describes the Niger River &quot;Through these lands flows a very large river, which at certain times of the year inundates all these lands. This river passes by the gates of Thambet [Timbuktu]. ... There are many boats on it, by which they carry on trade.&quot;

===Songhai Empire===
In the fifteenth century the Portuguese established trading-posts along the Atlantic coast of West Africa in an attempt to tap into the overland trade in gold bullion. It is from Portuguese sources that we learn a little more about the town. With the Mali empire in retreat, Djenne may have fought a war against the rising Songhai Empire under Sonni Sulayman Dama, a conflict whose echoes were reported by Diogo Gomes on the Gambia river. In 1471, Djenne was conquered by Sonni Ali soon after his seizure of Timbuktu. The siege lasted approximately 6 months. The flooding of the Bani protected the city, but also allowed Ali to bring his powerful river fleet to bear, blockading the city until. The sultan died during the siege, and his young son made peace with the Songhai and his mother married Sonni Ali, establishing the city&#x27;s high political position within the empire. Djenne did not support Askia Muhammad when he rebelled against Sonni Ali&#x27;s successor Sonni Baru, but quickly acquiesced to his seizure of power.

Under the Songhai, Djenne functioned as one of the key hubs in a thriving trade economy centered on the middle Niger river valley, with a population of approximately 40,000 people. Duarte Pacheco Pereira, a sea-captain and explorer, mentions Djenné in his &quot;Esmeraldo de situ orbis&quot; which he wrote between 1506 and 1508: &quot;...the city of Jany, inhabited by Negroes and surrounded by a stone wall, where there is great wealth of gold; tin and copper are greatly prized there, likewise red and blue cloths and salt ...&quot; The Portuguese historian João de Barros, writing in the 1520s, mentions Djenné and the export of gold from the island of Arguin off the coast of present-day Mauritania: &quot;Genná ... which in former times was more famous than Timbuktu ... As it is further to the west than Timbuktu, it is usually frequented by peoples of its neighbourhood, such as the Çaragoles [Sarakolle i.e. Sonike], Fullos Fulani], Jalofos Wolof], Azanegues Ṣanhāja, Brabixijs Barābīsh, Tigurarijs [people of Gurāra], and Luddayas [Ūdāya], from whom, through the Castle of Arguim and all that coast, gold came into our hands.&quot;
Salt was mined at Taghaza in the Sahara and transported south via Timbuktu and Djenné. Gold from the Akan goldfields in the forested area between the Komoé and Volta rivers was traded at the town of Begho (Bitu) and then transported north through Djenné and Timbuktu and across the Sahara to North Africa where it was exchanged for merchandise such as cloth, copper and brass. However, by the early sixteenth century, the Portuguese had established trading posts along the African coast and were shipping large quantities of gold from Elmina in present-day Ghana. This maritime trade competed with the trans-Saharan gold trade. 

Between the 14th and 17th centuries Djenné and Timbuktu were also important centers of Islamic study, in addition to their roles as entrepôts. Under Songhai administration, the city was led by the Jenne-&quot;koi&quot; or king, but also had a Jenne-&quot;mondio&quot; who answered to the Askias and was in charge of collecting taxes and customs duties.

The town is mentioned by Leo Africanus in his &quot;Descrittione dell’Africa&quot; which was completed in 1526 but not published until 1550. He had visited Mali with an uncle in around 1510 and perhaps again 3 years later. At several places in his book Leo Africanus describes the Niger River as flowing westwards from Timbuktu to Djenné. This has led some scholars to suggest that his account of Djenné was unlikely to be based on first hand observations and was probably based on information obtained from other travellers. He describes Djenné (which he refers to as Gheneo, Genni and Ghinea) as a village with houses constructed of clay with straw roofs. He mentions an abundance of barley, rice, livestock, fish and cotton and also the importance of trade with north Africa in which merchants exported cotton and imported European cloth, copper, brass, and arms. In the trade with Timbuktu merchants visited during the annual flood using small narrow canoes. Unstamped gold was used for coinage.

===After the Songhai===
The Moroccan sultan, Ahmad al-Mansur, wanted to control the export of gold and in 1590 sent an army of 4,000 mercenaries across the Sahara led by the converted Spaniard Judar Pasha. The Songhai were defeated at the Battle of Tondibi in 1591 and this led to the collapse of their empire.

Despite the fall of the Songhai, Djenné remained a thriving centre of trade and learning. In his chronicle al-Sadi describes the town in 1655, 70 years after the Moroccan conquest:
 Jenne is one of the great markets of the Muslims. Those who deal in salt from the mine of Taghaza meet there with those who deal in gold from the mine of Bitu. ... This blessed city of Jenne is the reason why caravans come to Timbuktu from all quarters-north, south, east and west. Jenne is situated to the south and west of Timbuktu beyond the two rivers. When the river is in flood, Jenne becomes an island, but when the flood abates the water is far from it. It begins to be surrounded by water in August, and in February the water recedes again.

Despite the initial success of the Moroccan occupation, the logistics of controlling a territory across the Sahara soon became too difficult and by 1630 the Saadians had lost control. The collapse of a centralised kingdom able to maintain order over a wide area led to a lack of security and a decline in the movement of traders and scholars. Djenné changed hands several times over the following centuries. The town formed part of the Segou kingdom from 1670 to 1818 and the Massina Empire established by the Fulani ruler Seku Amadu between 1818 and 1861.

In 1828 the French explorer René Caillié, who travelled disguised as a Muslim, became the first European to visit Djenné. He published a detailed description in his book &quot;Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo&quot;:
The town of Jenné is about two miles and half in circumference; it is surrounded by a very ill constructed earth wall, about ten feet high, and fourteen inches thick. There are several gates, but they are all small. The houses are built of bricks dried in the sun. The sand of the isle of Jenné is mixed with a little clay, and it is employed to make bricks of a round form which are sufficiently solid. The houses are as large as those of European villages. The greater part have only one storey ... They are all terraced, have no windows externally, and the apartments receive no air except from an inner court. The only entrance, which is of ordinary size, is closed by a door made of wooden planks, pretty thick, and apparently sawed. The door is fastened on the inside by a double iron chain, and on the outside by a wooden lock made in the country. Some however have iron locks. The apartments are all long and narrow. The walls, especially the outer, are well plastered with sand, for they have no lime. In each house there is a staircase leading to the terrace; but there are no chimneys, and consequently the slaves cook in the open air.

In 1861 the town became part of the Toucouleur Empire under Umar Tall and then in April 1893 French forces under the command of Louis Archinard occupied the town. The French journalist, Félix Dubois, visited the town in 1895, two years after the occupation. He published an account of his travels, together with many illustrations, in his book, &quot;Timbuctoo: the mysterious&quot;. At the time of his visit the town was still encircled by an adobe wall. It was through this book, and the French edition published in 1897, that Djenné and its architecture became known in Europe and the United States.

The French chose to make Mopti the regional capital and as a result the relative importance of Djenné declined.

==Architecture==
Djenné is famous for its Sudanese-style architecture. Nearly all of the buildings in the town, including the Great Mosque, are made from sun-baked earthen bricks which are coated with plaster.

The traditional flat-roofed two-storey houses are built around a small central courtyard and have imposing façades with pilaster like buttresses and an elaborate arrangement of pinnacles forming the parapet above the entrance door. The façades are decorated with bundles of rônier palm (&quot;Borassus aethiopum&quot;) sticks, called &quot;toron&quot;, that project about 60 cm from the wall. The &quot;toron&quot; also serve as readymade scaffolding. Ceramic pipes also extend from the roofline and ensure that the rain water from the roof does not damage the walls.

Some of the houses built before 1900 are in the Toucouleur-style and have a massive covered entrance porch set between two large buttresses. These houses generally have a single small window onto the street set above the entrance door. Many of the more recent two-storey houses are in the Moroccan-style and have small ornate windows but lack the covered entrance porch.

The adobe bricks are made on the river bank using a wooded mold and a mixture of earth and chopped straw. They are typical 36 x 18 x 8 cm in size and when laid are separated by 2 cm of mortar. Up to the 1930s hand molded cylindrical bricks were used called &quot;djenné-ferey&quot;. All the brickwork is covered with a protective layer of plaster consisting of a mixture of earth and rice husks.

In Djenné the adobe buildings need to be replastered at least every other year and even then the annual rains can cause serious damage. The Great Mosque is replastered every year and yet in 2009 one of the minarets collapsed after a period of heavy rainfall. The older buildings are often entirely rebuilt. A survey of the town in 1984 identified 134 two-storey buildings of significant architectural importance, yet by 1995, in spite of restrictions resulting from the town&#x27;s World Heritage status, 30% of the buildings on the list had been demolished, with most having been replaced with entirely new adobe buildings. Between 1996 and 2003 the Dutch government funded a project to restore around 100 of the older buildings in the town. For some buildings the restoration work involved little more than replastering the façade while for others it involved demolition and rebuilding. The total cost was 430 million FCFA (655,000 Euro).

In the early 1980s foreign aid organizations funded a system to supply drinking water to both public taps and private homes. However, no wastewater disposal system was installed at the time and, as a result, wastewater was discharged into the streets. This was both unsightly and unhygienic. Between 2004 and 2008 the German government funded a project to construct gravel filled trenches outside each home to allow the wastewater to infiltrate the soil. By 2008 1,880 homes had been provided with these local infiltration systems.

===Great Mosque===
In 1906 the French colonial administration arranged for the present Great Mosque to be built on the site of an earlier mosque. Different views have been expressed as to what extent the design of the present mosque was influenced by the colonial administration. The journalist Félix Dubois revisited the town in 1910 and was horrified by what he considered to be a French design with three minarets resembling bell towers while Jean-Louis Bourgeois has argued that the French had little influence except perhaps for the internal arches and that the design is &quot;basically African&quot;.

==World heritage status==

The Old Towns of Djenné is an archaeological and urban ensemble located in the city of Djenné, that comprises four archaeological sites, namely Djenné-Djeno, Hambarkétolo, Kaniana, and Tonomba. In 1988, it was inscribed by the UNESCO on the World Heritage list.

==Economy==

Although historically Djenné had been an important commercial and trading centre, in the 20th century commerce in the town declined due to its relatively isolated position. The local economy is now mainly based on agriculture, fishing and livestock and is very dependent on the annual rainfall and flooding of the Niger and Bani rivers. As a consequence, the severe drought that began in the late 1970s caused great hardship in the already impoverished town.

The town is a centre of Islamic scholarship and the Quranic schools attract students from outside the region.

Tourism is an important part of the local economy particularly in the dryer cooler winter months between November and March. Most tourists visit the Monday market and spend only one night in one of the 5 hotels/guest houses. In 2007 the town received around 15,000 visitors of whom 4,200 stayed overnight. Of these just over a third were from France with the remainder coming from a large number of other countries. In 2005 tourism contributed around 450 million CFA francs (687,000 Euro) to the economy of the town.

The town has received significant quantities of foreign aid with many countries contributing. The Canadian government helped fund the infrastructure to supply drinking water while the United States has contributed funds to maintain the system. The Dutch government funded a project to restore and plaster some of the old adobe buildings and the German government funded a scheme to improve the sanitation. Repairs to the mosque have been funded by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.

==Sights==

The main attractions are the Great Mosque and the two-story adobe houses with their monumental façades. The best known house is that of the Maiga family who supply the town&#x27;s tradition chief. This old building with its Toucouleur-style entrance porch is in the Algasba district on the eastern side of the town. René Caillé visited the house in 1828. Other attractions include the tomb of Tapama Djenepo, who in legend was sacrificed on the founding of the city, and the remains of Djenné-Jéno, an important settlement from the 3rd century BC until the 13th century AD.

The weekly Monday market, when buyers and sellers converge on the town from the surrounding regions, is a key tourist attraction. There is also a daily (women&#x27;s) market that takes place in a courtyard opposite the mosque.

The town is approximately eight hours by road from Bamako. The coaches to Mopti drop off passengers at the crossroads from Djenné.

The great mosque is out of bounds for non-Muslim tourists.

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of Djenné mostly speak a Songhay variety termed Djenné Chiini, but the languages spoken also reflect the diversity of the area. The villages around it variously speak Bozo, Fulfulde, or Bambara.

<text>Temoac is a town in the Mexican state of Morelos. 
The town serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality, with which it shares a name. Temoac comes from Nauhtl and means &quot;Temog-a&quot; (descend), &quot;Atl&quot; (water), &quot;Ko&quot; (adverb of place); &quot;place where water descends&quot;.

The municipality has the following boundaries: to the north with the municipalities of Yecapixtla and Zacualpan de Amilpas; to the south with Jonacatepec and Jantetelco; to the west with Ciudad Ayala and to the east with the State of Puebla. The municipality reported 15,844 inhabitants in 2015 census.

==History==
In pre-Hispanic times, the region where the Municipality of Temoac is located today was tributary to the &quot;Acolhuas&quot; of Texcoco, later to the Triple Alliance formed by the Mexicas, Acolhuas and&quot;Tepanecas&quot;. Later in the colonial period, several sugar estates were built in the region. &quot;El Trapiche de Chicomocelo&quot;, established around the year 1600 in the town of Tlacotepec, was part of the acquisitions made by the Society of Jesus, a religious who in just 69 years owned 82 haciendas. In spite of the benefits that the exploitation of the cane generated, the &quot;trapiches&quot; (refineries) were demolished by the &quot;Maximum School of San Pedro and Pablo&quot; in 1732 and switched to wheat production.

The municipal government building served as an elementary school for the children of Temoac in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The rural normal school &quot;Emiliano Zapata&quot; was created in Amalcingo on October 18, 1973. While the school has always tried to promote values to young teachers, since its beginning, the school has been plagued by underfinancing, hazing, and violence.

Differences between Zacualpan de Amilpas and surrounding communities led to the establishment of Temoac as a municipality on March 17, 1977.

Valentín Lavín Romero, the candidate of PVEM (Green Party) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018. Several of his family members were murdered on September 13, 2018. Temoac has been plagued with crime and violence; citizens of Temoac and neighboring municipalities in 2018 established extra-legal &quot;self-defense organizations&quot; due to threats from drug dealers.

Samir Flores, an activist and radio announcer from Amalcingo who opposed the construction of the thermoelectric plant in Huexca, Yecapixtla was murdered on February 20, 2019, only three days prior to the proposed referendum on the project. The referendum on the $22 billion peso (US$16 billion) plant was approved 59.1% in favor to 40.1% opposed by voters in Morelos, Puebla, and Tlaxcala, although the voting in Temoac was canceled due to violence.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. The state office of DIF sent food and water to vulnerable groups of people in eight municipalities including Temoac on May 26. On July 2, Temoac reported 32 infections and eight deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Temoac reported 13 cases, six recuperations, and four deaths from the virus as of August 31. Twenty-seven cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

== History ==
===Prehispanic History===
It is believed that in 1272, Mixtec women, men, and children who broke away from Iloala (present-day Iguala Guerrero founded the town of Tepalcingo. Ruins believed to belong to the &quot;Pueblo Viejo&quot;, located in the hills of Zopiloapan, west of modern Tepalcingo, have been found.

Tepalcingo was later conquered by the Aztecs in 1445, when it was subject to Huaxtepec (Oaxtepec).

===Colonial History===
After the Conquest of Mexico, Tepalcingo paid tribute directly to the Spanish crown until 1532 when it was incorporated in the lands of Hernán Cortés when it became subject to Yecapichtlan (Yecapixtla). Martín Cortés, son of the conquistador, faced an independence struggle of people who did not want to be subjects of the &quot;marquisate&quot;, and from 1565 Tepalcingo was included in what is called the &quot;Tlalnahuac&quot;, a group of fifteen towns south of Yecapixtla. Cortes gained possession of the lands in 1587, after which they passed to the Dukes of Terranova and then the Dukes of Monteleone. The inhabitants of the 15 villages of the Tlalnahuac were decimated by smallpox, plague, measles, and other diseases brought from Europe since they did not have defenses against so many new diseases. Thus the people of the Tlalnahuac could not organize a coordinated resistance, and for 350 years they were subjugated by the haciendas.

===Independence and 19th Century===
Vicente Guerrero abolished the marquisate in 1829; however, for many years, part of the hacienda properties would remain in the hands of descendants of Hernán and Martín Cortés. The people of Tepalcingo vainly petitioned for restitution of their lands in 1853.

Upon independence in 1821, the modern territory of Morelos was part of the State of Mexico. In 1869 the state of Morelos was founded, and Tepalcingo, including Huautla, became a municipality on June 14, 1872. A smallpox epidemic decimated the area between 1895 and 1910; between August 1903 and January 1904, 573 of 574 children in Tepelcingo died.

===Revolution and 20th Century===
Local residents Dionisio Gómez, Severiano Pérez, Claudio Pérez, Isabel X., Macedonio Coyote, Martín Barba, Epifanio Vázquez, Severiano Pariente, and Severiano Trejo died during the Mexican Revolution.

===21st Century===
Although the epicenter of the September 19, 2017 earthquake was in Axochiapan, the municipality of Tepalcingo was among the most severely affected. Public, private, and religious buildings were seriously damaged; there was structural damage to the Sanctuary of Jesus of Nazareth, which nearly collapsed; all the other churches of the municipality were damaged as well as the municipal presidency, the market, and other buildings. Municipal President Alfredo Sánchez Vélez said that 700 homes could not be used, while others had cracks. No lives were reported lost. The Secretary of Health reported that 486 homes were destroyed and 2,263 were damaged, more than in any other municipality.

Alfredo Sánchez Velez of PVEM (Green Party) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018. Violence is a major concern; 400 people tried to lynch four men suspected of kidnapping a child on January 22, 2019.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; two cases were reported in Tepalcingo. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. Ninety-five cases were reported in the municipality on December 27, 2020. Vaccinations for senior citizens (60+) are scheduled to begin on March 12, 2021.

Fifteen people died in Axochiapan, Jantetelco, and Tepalcingo due to adulterated alcohol on Mother&#x27;s Day.

==Culture==
The oldest fair in Morelos is held in Tepelcingo on the third Friday of Lent. Visitors come from all over Morelos and nearby states; they enjoy pulque, and traditional dances. Cattle and handicrafts, including boxes of &quot;Olinalá&quot; aromatic wood are sold. This is the fourth most important fair of Mexico and the largest popular fair in Mexico type &quot;Tiaquixtli&quot;.

There are three types of music: &quot;Tecuanes&quot;, &quot;Tlatenquiza&quot;, and &quot;Cañeros&quot;. Cuisine includes greenmole of pepita (pipián) with tamales of cenizas, red turkey mole, cecina with cheese, cream, and green sauce with guaje; barbecue of kid and wild pigeons stewed in pipián or in green sauce.

=== Sierra de Huautla ===

Established in 2006, the &quot;Sierra de Huautla Biosphere Reserve&quot; (REBIOSH) covers 59,031 hectares (145,869 acres) in the Balsas River Basin of the municipalities of Tlaquiltenango, Amacuzac, Tepalcingo, Jojutla, and Puente de Ixtla. Its rough topology varies from 700 to 2,240 meters (2,297 to 7,349 feet) above sea level in the Balsas Basin and constitutes a rich reservoir of endemic species to Mexico. There is a broad range of ecosystem, including low deciduous forest, gallery vegetation, and pine and oak forests. 939 species of plants, 44 species of butterflies, 71 species of mammals, 208 species of birds, 53 species of reptiles, 18 species of amphibians, and 14 species of fish have been noted. Among the species of animals are jaguars, short-horned Baronia butterfly, beaded lizard, military macaw, roufus-backed robin, Balsas screech owl, Pileated flycatcher, mountain lion, ocelot, margay, bobcat, and jaguarundi.

==Tourism==
Tourism includes the Pre-Hispanic &quot;Pueblo Viejo&quot;, &quot;Las Termas&quot; thermal water park of Atotonilco, with 29 °C (84 °F) water and the &quot;Los Delfines&quot; water park. There is Ecotourism- in the &quot;Sierra de Huatla&quot;, the scenic view of the &quot;Cerrito Tepactzin&quot;, and the dam. The sanctuary of the Lord of Tepalcingo, the churches of Santa Mónica, Holy Cross, and Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, and the parish of San Martín Obispo (feast November 11), as well as the Hacienda de San Nicolás Tolentino are also popular with tourists.

===Shrine of the Lord of Tepalcingo===
According to legend, in the 16th century, a girl found a small [30 centimeter tall] wooden figure in the river. The figure represented Jesus Christ tied by his arms to a column. A small hermitage was built where the figure was venerated. Over the years, the sculpture was moved, first to the chapel of Santa Cruz, and then to that of San Martín. In the 18th century, a craftsman from Puebla was commissioned to make a larger sculpture of the Patron Saint, but, unlike the Lord of the Column, he was asked to change the figure to Jesus of Nazareth with a cross. The figure was brought to Tepalcingo and the men who were carrying it said, &quot;it became heavy&quot;. A church made of yellow stone from Chalcatcingo was built in that exact place.

Agustín Pila Dreinhofer, in the book &quot;Arquitectura Barroca&quot; (UNAM, 2013), highlights the Shrine of Tepalcingo as the best example of popular baroque in New Spain. The most striking aspect of this temple is its main façade or doorway, in pink - &quot;a true theological treatise&quot;, according to Pila Dreinhofer -, with elements, twisted columns, animals, characters and scenes from the Old and New Testaments, from the Creation of the world until the Last Supper; made in stucco, similar to a technique used in pyramids and pre-Hispanic buildings.

==Communities==
Tepalcingo is divided into 20 localities; the most important are: Tepalcingo (the municipal seat), Huitchila, Ixtlilco El Chico, Ixtlilco, Ixtlilco El Grande, Los Sauces, El Tepehuaje, El Limón, Pitzotlán, El Pastor, and Zacapalco.

<doc id="732140" wikidata="Q1020785" url="?curid=732140" title="Tepoztlán">
<text>Tepoztlán () is a town in the central Mexican state of Morelos. It is located at in the heart of the Tepoztlán Valley. The town serves as the seat of government for the municipality of the same name. The town had a population of 14,130 inhabitants, while the municipality reported 41,629 inhabitants in the 2010 national census.

The town is a popular tourist destination near Mexico City. The town is famous for the remains of El Tepozteco temple built on top of the nearby Tepozteco Mountain, as well as for the exotic ice cream flavors prepared by the townspeople.

Tepoztlán was named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; (or &quot;magic town&quot;) in 2002 but its title was removed in 2009 for failure to maintain the requirements. In 2010 Tepoztlán addressed these problems and recovered the Pueblo Mágico title.

==Etymology==
Tepoztlán is derived from Nahuatl and means &quot;place of abundant copper&quot; or &quot;place of the broken rocks.&quot; This is derived from the words &quot;tepoz-tli&quot; (copper) and &quot;tlan&quot; (&quot;place of/place of abundance&quot;).

==Geography==
===Climate===
The climate around the Tepoztlán Sierra (where &quot;el Tepozteco&quot; is located) shows temperate as well as some subtropical variations. The rainy season starts during the summer and ends at the beginning of autumn. Precipitation reaches /yr in the Tepoztlán Valley and up to /yr in the mountains.

==Economy==
Agriculture specially growing of maize, chili and tomatoes, livestock growing. Traditional pottery and handicrafts (for which there is a lively weekend market or &quot;tianguis&quot;).

Tourism: Nowadays Tepoztlán gets its most important income through tourism. People visit the town for its authentic traditional environment, along with the pyramid and several communities with ecological or progressive thinking.

Real estate: The legal system that regulates possession of land in Tepoztlán is communal. Under that legal framework, land in Tepoztlán cannot be purchased. In case of problems, neither financial nor judicial institutions can support ownership claims.

Meztitla Scout Camp School is owned by the Mexican government, located near Tepozteco mountain. Meztitla is the National Scout Camp School. Although Meztitla is frequented by Scouts of Mexico and from around the world, it is also open to the general public.

==History==

According to myth, Amatlán, in the municipality of Tepoztlan is the birthplace of &quot;Ce Acatl&quot;, later known as Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl, and who may be the possible historical basis of the Mesoamerican god Quetzalcoatl over 1200 years ago, the feathered serpent god widely worshipped in ancient Mexico.

It has not yet been possible to determine who first inhabited the area. The earliest findings of pottery and other ceramic utensils date back to approximately 1500 BCE.

At the top of a hill, there is a small pyramid devoted to Ometochtli-Tepoztēcatl, the supposed inventor of pulque, a beer-like drink made from the maguey plant. The pyramid, called El Tepozteco, dates from the Post-Classic Period (900–1521 CE) and has inscriptions dating from 1452 and 1502.

During the Spanish Conquest (1521), Hernán Cortés is said to have ordered the town razed after the refusal of the town leaders to meet him. This event was chronicled by Bernal Díaz del Castillo in The Conquest of New Spain. A monastery was built here by the Dominicans between 1555 and 1580, and in 1993 was declared World Heritage by the UNESCO.

Anthropologists Robert and Margaret Park Redfield lived in Tepoztlán 1926-27 and published &quot;Tepoztlan, a Mexican Village: A Study in Folk Life&quot;, and &quot;Notes on the Cookery of Tepoztlan, Morelos&quot;

Surrealist painter Wolfgang Paalen lived and worked in Tepoztlán during his last Mexican period (1954–59).

The hiking trail the Sierra de Tepoztlan to the pyramid was closed temporally after the 2017 Puebla earthquake. 203 homes were destroyed and 744 were damaged in the municipality.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, Tepoztlan blocked the entrances to the community. As of April 27, 2020, two cases were reported in Tepoztlán. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On July 2, Tepoztlán reported five infections but no deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Tepoztlán reported 75 cases, 58 recuperations, and nine deaths from the virus as of August 31. One hundred thirty-three cases were reported on December 27, 2020. The community health center was briefly closed when employees protested against the lack of vaccines; it reopened January 21 after being promised vaccines.

A fire that burned of forest from May 19 to 22, 2020, was allegedly provoked by a 25-year-old woman as a stunt to get on TikTok. The fire threatened not only the forest but also the town of Santo Domingo Ocotitlan. She could be sentenced to ten years of prison. The &quot;Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente&quot; (Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection, PROFEPA) says it will seek financial and penal compensation.

== The Legend of Tepozteco ==
There are several versions of the story of Tepozteco. One that describes a man by the last name of Tepoztón who is born to a laundress and ends up working in Tenochtitlan, Mexico where he is converted to Catholicism. As a form of payment for some work he did helping to hang a bell at one of the Catholic churches, he receives 3 boxes and is instructed not to open them. However, his curiosity wins and he opens the boxes. Opening the boxes let out the birds that were inside which acted as a symbol of the riches and wellbeing of the people.

Another version of the story refers to Tepozteco as a person who was baptized and introduced to the Catholic Church on September 8, 1532 in the Axitla River, at the base of the mountain where a statue of Ometochtli was found. A young 22-year-old missionary named Fray Domingo de la anunciación, baptized Tepozteco after having thrown the idol, worshiped by pilgrims from Chiapas and Guatemala, off a cliff.

Four important gentlemen from surrounding areas: Yautepec, Oaxtepec, Tlayacapan, and Cuauhnahuac, accuse Tepozteco of having betrayed their gods and they challenge him. He defeats them and with the strength of his speech, convinces them of all the goodness of the new religion.

Of this legend, let&#x27;s point out that one of the four natural elements is spoken of; the air, which is attributed with thinking or reasoning. We see that this characteristic is brought up when Tepoztecatl, comes out on top of every difficult situation that he faces. Reasonably, he boasts that he is son of Quetzalcoatl, &quot;God of the Wind,&quot; which allows him to be protected by him at every moment.

==The municipality==
The municipality is one of 17 municipalities that border Mexico City. It borders the Milpa Alta borough at the south side of the capital city. Rogelio Torres Ortega of &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the election of July 1, 2018.

===Towns and villages===
The largest localities (cities, towns, and villages) are:
==Attractions and festivals==

The foundation of the town dates from around 1100 AD, by the arrival of the Nahuatl-speaking immigrants. San Juan was the stop on the Mexico City-Cuernavaca rail line, from 1897 to 1997, that is closest to Tepoztlan. In 1993 archaeological pieces dating from 1028 CE were found in a nearby hill called &quot;Chimalacatepetl&quot;; these are located in a small museum that opened in 1995. The feast of St. John is celebrated on June 24. Spelunkers will enjoy exploring the &quot;Cueva del Diablo&quot; (Devil&#x27;s Cave), &quot;Cueva del Ferrocarril&quot; (Railroad Cave), and other caves in the area.
*&quot;Santa Catalina&quot; is west of Tepoztlan. The church, dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria, has a delicately-decorated bell tower of two levels. St. Catherine&#x27;s feast day is November 24.
*&quot;Amatlán&quot; is east of Tepoztlán. The mythical birthplace of the god Quetzálcoatl is located by an exuberant waterfall a short hike out of town. Amatlán has two festivals during the year: May 29 in honor of Quetzalcoatl, and June 22 for the Feast of Santa Magdalena.
*&quot;Museo Carlos Pellicer&quot; located behind the monastery, is an archaeological museum that opened in 1965.
*Meztitla Scout Camp School is a campground/school owned and operated since 1956 by the Asociación de Scouts de México, Asociación Civil. The name means &quot;Place near the Moon&quot;; besides hosting activities for Scouts from around the world, it is open to the general public for hiking, camping, and rappel. It is located in Santo Domingo Ocuitco, west of Tepoztlan.

===Pyramid of Tepozteco===
The archaeological site of El Tepozteco is centered on the 13th-century temple dedicated to Tepoztēcatl, god of pulque. The sanctuary is located at 2,310 meters above sea level (7,579 feet) while the main plaza of Tepoztlán is at 1,715 m (5,627 ft). A rustic trail leads up to the sanctuary, climbing 595 m (1,952 ft) along 2 km (1 1/4 miles) of length. Due to the steep climb and rough terrain, people take anywhere from 20 minutes to three hours to make the journey.

From the summit there are views of the town of Tepoztlan and the Valley of Cuernavaca. As the national park is located within the &quot;Chichinautzin Biological Corridor&quot; there is plenty of rich flora and fauna.

===Museo Ex Convento de Tepoztlán (Museo de la Natividad)===

The Tepoztlán Ex Convento Museum was built by the Tepoztecan Indians under the orders of the Dominican friars between 1555 and 1580, dedicated to the Virgin of the Nativity. In 1993, INAH created a restoration project and in 1994 it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This site is the parish of the Nativity and the Museum and Historical Documentation Center of Tepoztlán.

This monastery consists of a large atrium that has served as a cemetery and park. There are four &quot;capillas posas&quot; in each of the corners, although only the ones on the north side are well-preserved. The &quot;capillas posas&quot; were invented in Nueva España for the instruction of large crowds of Indigenous, and their use later spread to Guatemala, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia.

<doc id="732141" wikidata="Q1224295" url="?curid=732141" title="Dieulafoy's lesion">
<text>Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion () is a medical condition characterized by a large tortuous artery most commonly in the stomach wall (submucosal) that erodes and bleeds. It can present in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It can cause gastric hemorrhage but is relatively uncommon. It is thought to cause less than 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeds in adults. It was named after French surgeon Paul Georges Dieulafoy, who described this condition in his paper &quot;Exulceratio simplex: Leçons 1-3&quot; in 1898. It is also called &quot;caliber-persistent artery&quot; or &quot;aneurysm&quot; of gastric vessels. However, unlike most other aneurysms, these are thought to be developmental malformations rather than degenerative changes.

==Signs and symptoms==
Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion often do not cause symptoms (asymptomatic). When present, symptoms usually relate to painless bleeding, with vomiting blood (hematemesis) and/or black stools (melena). Less often, Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesions may cause rectal bleeding (hematochezia), or rarely, iron deficiency anemia. Usually, there are no gastrointestinal symptoms that precede the bleeding (abdominal pain, nausea, etc.).

Though exceptionally rare, cases of Dieulafoy lesions occurring in the gallbladder can cause upper abdominal pain, which is usually right upper quadrant or upper middle (epigastric). Though gallbladder Dieulafoy lesions usually occur with anemia (83%), they generally do not cause overt bleeding (hematochezia, hematemesis, melena, etc.).

==Cause==
In contrast to peptic ulcer disease, a history of alcohol use disorder or NSAID use is usually absent in Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion.

==Pathophysiology==
Dieulafoy lesions are characterized by a single abnormally large blood vessel (arteriole) beneath the gastrointestinal mucosa (submucosa) that bleeds, in the absence of any ulcer, erosion, or other abnormality in the mucosa. The size of these blood vessels varies from 1–5 mm (more than 10 times the normal diameter of mucosal capillaries). Pulsation from the enlarged vessels leads to focal pressure that causes thinning of the mucosa at that location, leading to exposure of the vessel and subsequent hemorrhage.

Approximately 75% of Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesions occur in the upper part of the stomach within 6 cm of the gastroesophageal junction, most commonly in the lesser curvature. However, Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesions may occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Extragastric lesions have historically been thought to be uncommon but have been identified more frequently in recent years, likely due to increased awareness of the condition. The duodenum is the most common location (14%) followed by the colon (5%), surgical anastamoses (5%), the jejunum (1%) and the esophagus (1%). Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesions have been reported in the gallbladder. The pathology in these extragastric locations is essentially the same as that of the more common gastric lesion.

==Diagnosis==
A Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion is difficult to diagnose, because of the intermittent pattern of bleeding. Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion are typically diagnosed during endoscopic evaluation, usually during upper endoscopy, which may show an isolated protruding blood vessel. Lesions affecting the colon or end of the small bowel (terminal ileum) may be diagnosed during colonoscopy. Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesions are not easily recognized and therefore multiple evaluations with endoscopy may be necessary. Once identified during endoscopy, the mucosa near a Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion may be injected with ink. Tattooing the area can aid in identifying the location of the Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion in the event of rebleeding. Endoscopic ultrasound has been used both to facilitate identification of Dieulafoy lesions and confirm the treatment success.

Angiography may be helpful with diagnosis, though this only identifies bleeding that actively occurs during the time of that test. Mesenteric angiography may be particularly helpful for Dieulafoy lesions in the colon or rectum, where the evaluation may be limited by the presence of blood or poor bowel preparation.

==Treatment==
In most cases, Dieulafoy lesions are treated with endoscopic interventions. Endoscopic techniques used in the treatment include epinephrine injection followed by bipolar or monopolar electrocoagulation, injection sclerotherapy, heater probe, laser photocoagulation, hemoclipping or banding.

In cases of refractory bleeding, interventional radiology may be consulted for an angiogram with subselective embolization.

==Prognosis==
The mortality rate for Dieulafoy&#x27;s was much higher before the era of endoscopy, where open surgery was the only treatment option. Mortality has decreased from 80% to 8% as a result of endoscopic therapies. Long term control of bleeding (hemostasis) is achieved in 85 - 90 percent of cases.

==Epidemiology==
Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesions account for roughly 1.5 percent of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. These lesions are twice as common in men, and often occur in older individuals (over 50 years of age) with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesions present in individuals with an average age of 52 years.

==History==
Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesion was first described in 1884 by M.T. Gallard. The lesion was named after French surgeon Paul Georges Dieulafoy, who described the condition in his paper &quot;Exulceratio simplex: Leçons 1-3&quot; in 1898. Dieulafoy believed (incorrectly) the bleeding from this lesion was due to erosions of the mucosa in the stomach.

<text>BBC Choice was a British digital television channel which was owned by the BBC and was launched on 23 September 1998. It was the first British TV channel to broadcast exclusively in digital format, as well as the BBC&#x27;s second non-analogue-terrestrial channel launch (following on from the BBC News channel in 1997).

At launch, BBC Choice mainly existed to supplement existing programming on BBC One and Two, with some low-profile original programming of its own. However, faced with low ratings for both Choice and BBC Knowledge, in 2000 the BBC&#x27;s digital strategy changed. Under new controller Stuart Murphy, the channel began to aim specifically at a young adult audience. The BBC ultimately planned to replace the channel with the higher-profile BBC Three, which, after some delay, began broadcasting in February 2003.

==History==
===Launch===

When BBC Choice launched, no digital TV receivers were available to the general public as Sky Digital and ONdigital had not yet launched. Instead, the launch programme was broadcast over the internet, with the first day&#x27;s schedule including a &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; guide to digital television and repeats of the very first episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

The main format of the channel was a mix of BBC One and Two programming as well as original programming such as &quot;Backstage&quot;, broadcast live each weeknight, which took viewers behind the scenes of different parts of the BBC. The channel also provided exclusive coverage of music festivals such as Glastonbury and extended live coverage of sport, for when either BBC One or Two have to end their coverage early or their schedules are unable to provide live sport action.

BBC Choice also introduced an innovative programme format known as &#x27;Hotlink&#x27;, which expanded on popular shows. Examples included &quot;Watchdog Extra&quot;, where viewers could contact the show by phone or e-mail with either questions or feedback on the issues discussed. &quot;Crimewatch Extra&quot; provided follow-up detail on the cases involved in the main programme, and &quot;Row Z&quot; was a football discussion forum that aired after &quot;Match of the Day&quot; finished on BBC One. The &#x27;Hotlink&#x27; format has since been adopted by many other channels, particularly both ITV2 and E4.

BBC Choice initially broadcast from 5pm daily; this later switched to 7pm. The 7pm start carried over into its successor BBC Three.

===Children&#x27;s programming===
BBC Choice also aired children&#x27;s programmes; this duty transferred to CBBC and CBeebies when they launched on 11 February 2002.

For the first year of BBC Choice, children&#x27;s programming would air on weekend afternoons as CBBC Choice, and included strands like &#x27;Dog &amp; Dinosaur&#x27;, &#x27;The Crew Room&#x27;, &#x27;L&amp;K Replay&#x27; and &#x27;Re:Peter&#x27;. From 29 November 1999, this was supplanted with a daily CBBC on Choice strand, running from 6am to 7pm every day, for programmes aimed at pre-school children, with presentation links pre-recorded by a CBBC presenter. It included repeats of archive shows rarely seen on the main channels, such as the first few series of &quot;Bodger &amp; Badger&quot;, &quot;Mr Benn&quot;, &quot;Paddington&quot;, &quot;Simon and the Witch&quot;, &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;, &quot;Jonny Briggs&quot;, &quot;Pigeon Street&quot;, and &quot;Bitsa&quot;. This continued until February 2002, when the CBBC and CBeebies channels launched, with the CBBC channel taking up BBC Choice&#x27;s daytime broadcast bandwidth, but occupying a separate EPG position.

===Post-2000 refresh===
In June 2000, the BBC radically changed its digital channel formats. The initial format had seen BBC Choice target a similar mixed audience to BBC One and Two with a general entertainment skew, with BBC Knowledge focusing on educational and informative programming. From 2000 both Knowledge and Choice became targeted to more specific audiences, with Knowledge moving to a broader documentary and culture mix and Choice focusing on developing a stronger relationship with the young adult audience, which historically the BBC had difficulty reaching. BBC Choice abandoned many of its original programmes such as &quot;Backstage&quot;, and aimed at younger people, with most of the early part of the schedules being made up of fifteen-minute programmes under the banner of &quot;Refreshing TV&quot; or &quot;Micro TV&quot;. Entertainment news magazine &quot;Liquid News&quot;, presented by Christopher Price, evolved out of News 24&#x27;s &quot;Zero 30&quot; and became the channel&#x27;s flagship show.

===Announcement of the end of BBC Choice===
In August 2000, the BBC announced that it would replace BBC Choice with BBC Three as soon as possible, which would become a continuation of the &quot;youth&quot; aspect of the new BBC Choice. But the government delayed approving BBC Three, which formed part of wider plans to reshape the BBC&#x27;s digital provision, plans which also included the proposed BBC Four, two children&#x27;s channels, and five digital radio stations. Whilst BBC Three was delayed, the other proposals gained the approval of Parliament and the new channels went on air in 2002, meaning BBC Four launched prior to BBC Three. From October 2001, BBC Choice began screening a significant amount of new, young-skewing programming, the kind of content that had been earmarked for BBC Three.

The BBC submitted a revised proposal for the new channel raised the target age range to 25–34 and increased the amount of factual and arts programming, with a nightly 15-minute news programme – it was hoped these changes would better illustrate how BBC Three would differ from rivals such as E4, ITV2 and Sky One. This new proposal for BBC Three was given the go-ahead in September 2002, with a set of public-service conditions laid down and a launch date of February 2003 set. The final night of BBC Choice was given over entirely to previews of the new channel.

==Programming==
Initially, the main attractions of BBC Choice were multi-broadcast TV shows, with the option to choose which programme you viewed. The first broadcast by the BBC with this option was two months after the launch of the channel, showing &quot;Stressed Eric&quot;, with &quot;Naked Video&quot; as the Digital Teletext option. In addition, BBC Choice also aired new episodes of some series, such as &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, before their first broadcast on the terrestrial BBC channels.

Its single-show programming was mainly concerned with celebrities, including documentary profiles and the nightly entertainment magazine &quot;Liquid News&quot;. &quot;EastEnders Revealed&quot; was the only show from the original 1998 channel lineup to survive and outlive the entire life of the channel itself, transferring to its successor, BBC Three.

===Regional variations===
BBC Choice had regional variations for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland which were broadcast in place of the network BBC Choice service in their respective areas from 10:30pm (following the &quot;EastEnders&quot; replay) to circa midnight nightly. At the time the BBC&#x27;s digital offering included the national variants of BBC One (England, Scotland, Wales, NI) and a single nationwide BBC Two.

The regional variations of Choice were discontinued in 2001 in favour of introducing regional opt-outs on BBC Two to digital services; in some cases, such as BBC 2W in Wales, analogue and digital versions of BBC Two were separately scheduled, but by 2010 all differences between the analogue and digital variants of BBC Two had ceased, and there is now one version of the channel in each area, broadcasting on analogue (until switchoff) and digital platforms. The English regional variants of BBC One were made available digitally from 2003.

Since the cessation of the BBC Choice splits, all BBC digital TV channels (including Choice&#x27;s successor BBC Three) have operated as UK-wide services with no regional opt-out functionality.

<text>Tetecala is a city in the Mexican state of Morelos.

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality, with which it shares a name. The toponym Tetecala comes from a Nahuatl name and means &quot;place of stone houses&quot;. The full name of the town is Tetecala de la Reforma because the Laws of the Reforma were signed there in the mid-19th century.

The municipality reported 7,772 inhabitants in the 2015 census.

==History==
===Prehispanic history===
Vestiges of Olmec, Chichimeca, and Tlahuica Prehispanic human settlements have been found in the area that includes modern Tetecals. It is evident that there were settlements of different sizes and that it was an important place of passage between the manors of Coatlán and Mazatepec.

===Colonial history===
Tetecala was founded between 1521 and 1583 when it first appears on a map. By 1594 it was called &quot;San Francisco de Tetecala&quot; and it was an important agricultural center. Cuautitla was founded about this time.

By 1746, Tetecala and the surrounding area had 266 families of &quot;Indians&quot; and 32 of &quot;Spaniards and Mestizos&quot;, as well as some of &quot;Mulatos.&quot; Eighty years later, the population had increased to 4,040 inhabitants that were distributed in the town of Tetecala, five haciendas, and ten ranches. By Royal Decree of December 4, 1786, the Municipality of Tetecala corresponded to the State of Mexico.

The fertile plain of Tetecala was considered the most luxuriant in the jurisdiction of Cuernavaca. Several 17th and 18th century travelers described the area as &quot;very entertaining and fun&quot;.

===19th Century and early independence===
The local parish priest, Andrés González Meraz, illegally seized lands in Tlatempan. One of the last battles of the Mexican War of Independence took place in Tetecala on June 2, 1821, when Pedro Ascencio Alquicira attacked royalist Dionisio Boheta. Ascencio was killed the following day.

The municipality of Tetecalpa was founded as a part of the State of Mexico on August 6, 1824. An 1826 census reported 651 day-laborers, 50 farmers, 20 artisans, 19 merchants, two manufacturers of brandy, two presbyters, a surgeon, a teacher, and a responsible civil authority. Commerce stands out since Tetecala had a smaller population than Xochitepec, Tlaltizapán, Puente de Ixtla, or Tlaquiltenango, but it had more commercial activity than any of them. Sugar cane, bananas, huacamote (sic) (tomatoes?), jicama, plums, watermelons, mamey, corn and beans were grown locally.

There was a peasant revolt in Tetecala, Miacatlan, and Xochitepec in 1848. Lt. Manuel Arellano led the fight against the hacienda owners, who were supported by Kad Waleder, leader of the American troops who had invaded in 1847. Tetecala supported Juan Alvarez during the La Reforma (1854−1857). During the ensuing war, Tetecala sheltered Benito Juarez, the Lerdo de Tejada brothers, Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Ignacio Ramírez &quot;El Nigromante&quot;, Guillermo Prieto, Manuel Doblado, José María Iglesias, and others. The Masonic Lodge &quot;La Palanca&quot; was founded in 1857.

The state of Morelos was established in 1869; the &quot;Villa de Tetecala&quot; became a city and adopted the name &quot;Tetecala de la Reforma&quot; on December 11, 1873.

===20th Century and revolution===
At the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, the owners of the haciendas of Contlalco, Cuautitla, Actopan, and Santa Cruz and wealthy merchants fled the municipality. Several groups of peasants joined the rebel &quot;Zapatista&quot; forces. Atrocities were committed by both sides in the conflict, although the terrorism spread by Carranza general Pablo González Garza was without precedent.

The distillery and ice house &quot;La Morelense&quot; functioned from 1935 to 1936. There were several sugar and rice mills in the community, which were dismantled in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Former employees became low-income wage earners, and many joined the popular movement led by Rubén Jaramillo. When Jamarillo and his family were gunned down by federal police in 1962, his body was taken to the &quot;Miguel Hidalgo Hospital&quot; (now the House of Culture) in Tetecala for autopsy, which was performed by Dr. Ernesto González Brito.

During the 1990s, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as &quot;El Señor de los Cielos&quot; (Lord of the Skies) used to hold fiestas for his drug-dealing friends at his home in Tetecala while the government of Jorge Carrillo Olea seemingly looked the other way.

===21st Century===
The Escuela de Estudios Superiores de Tetecala (School of Higher Education of Tetecala), affiliated with the Morelos State University opened in August 2016 in Mazatepec. The initial programs were in nursing and nutrition; a program for Rural Surgeons opened in January 2018. The school had 208 students; the rector of the UAEM was Gustavo Urquiza Beltrán, and the first director of the school in Tetecala was Miriam Tapia.

Six people died during the September 19, 2017 earthquake.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; two cases were reported in Tetecala. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On July 2, Tetecala reported 11 infections and three deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Tetecala reported 13 cases, 13 recuperations, but no deaths from the virus as of August 31. Twenty-two cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

==Tourism and attractions==
The church of San Francisco of Assisi is in the historic center of Tetecala. It was built in the 18th century in Neoclassic style. The chapel of the Virgin of Candlemas, also from the 18th century, is located on the federal highway. There is a colonial-era fountain in front of the chapel of the &quot;Alma de de la Virgin&quot;.

The area along the Chalma River has lush vegetation, a variety of fruit trees, and abundant fauna. There are old historic mansions housing the House of Culture and the regional public library. President Benito Juarez stayed here when he visited the city in 1857.

The water park &quot;La Playa&quot;, which features five pools and offers alternative medicine, is found in the municipality. There is a panoramic view of the town from the top of the hill of &quot;Las Cruces&quot;. &quot;Cascos de las Haciendas&quot; (manor houses) nearby include Santa Cruz Vista Alegre, Actopan, Cuautlita, and Cocoyotla).

The traditional &quot;tianguis&quot; (market) is on Tuesday.

==Culture==
Local fiestas are held on February 2 (Virgen de la Candelaria) in Tetecala, May 15 (St. Isidore the Laborer) in Actopan, July 31 (St. Ignatius of Loyola) in Actopan, September 29 (St. Michael the Archangel) in Cuautitla, October 4 (San Francisco de Asís) in Tetecala, and December 12 (Virgin of Guadalupe) in the &quot;El Paso&quot; neighborhood.

There are two brass bands, one Cuautlita and another in Tetecala. Tetecala was the birthplace of several well-known performers and composers.

Saddle-making and basket weaving are local handicrafts.

Local food includes corn or chickpea &quot;pozole&quot; with pork, chicken and even shrimp; beef jerky with cream and cheese or pork enchilada; green pip &quot;mole&quot;, red turkey &quot;mole&quot;, fish in &quot;mixiote&quot;, tamal, and &quot;clemole&quot; seasoned with wild plums and tamarind; peppers stuffed with cheese and mincemeat, and &quot;huazontles&quot;. Traditional sweets such as pumpkin, sweet pipían, crystallized fruit, quince, tejocote, fruits in syrup, cajeta (crystalized goat&#x27;s milk), buñuelos, and ice cream are also made.

==Communities==

<text>Marcolino José Carlos Moco (born June 19, 1953 in Chitue, Ekunha) is an Angolan politician. He was the 3rd Prime Minister of Angola from December 2, 1992, until June 3, 1996. He served as the first Executive Secretary of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth.

==Career==
Moco was fired from his role by President José Eduardo dos Santos. Santos removed the entire cabinet alongside the Governor of the central bank in a bid to be seen as decisive. Moco was a member of the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the party of the President, which had been the ruling party until 1991, shortly before Moco became Prime Minister (with an interlude by a government of national unity, after which the MPLA again became the ruling party until the present).

===CPLP===
In July 1996, Moco became the first Executive Secretary of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, a new international organization which Portugal and most of its former colonies, including Angola, joined. Moco&#x27;s term as Executive Secretary ended in 2000.

==Personal life==
Moco&#x27;s eldest son is Chilala Moco, a photographer based in Angola and Portugal.

<doc id="732145" wikidata="Q2652196" url="?curid=732145" title="Tetela del Volcán">
<text>Tetela del Volcán or simply Tetela, is a town and municipal seat of the municipality of Tetela del Volcán in the Mexican state of Morelos. It is located on the slopes of the volcano Popocatépetl. .
The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. It is notable for its sixteenth century Dominican ex-convent which together with a number of other early monasteries nearby in the area has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The municipality reported 20,698 inhabitants in the year 2015 census. Other towns in the municipality of Tetela del Volcán include Hueyapan, &quot;Xochicalco&quot; (not to be confused with the archeological site of the same name) and &quot;Tlamimilulpan&quot;.

The toponym &quot;Tetela&quot; comes from Nahuatl and means &quot;place of rocks&quot;. The &quot;Volcán&quot; (&quot;volcano&quot;) referred to is, of course, Popocatépetl.

== History ==

In 1503, Tetela del Volcán and nearby Hueyapan were subjugated to the Aztec Empire by Moctezuma II. The first Spaniards to arrive in Tetela were Bernardino Vázquez de Tapia and Pedro de Alvarado in 1519. After the fall of Tenochtitlán Cortés arrived in Tetela del Volcán, where he found the Indians to be resistant and fierce. According to Diego Durán their subjugation was achieved only thanks to the intervention of María Estrada and her husband Pedro Sánchez Farfán, for which Cortés awarded the couple the lands of Tetela as an encomienda. In 1561 this &quot;encomienda&quot; was revoked and laid under the Spanish Crown directly, and in the &quot;Relacion Geográfica&quot; from 1665 this &quot;realengo&quot; appears to be administrated by corregidor Cristóbal Martínez de Maldonado.

In the 17th century, the indigenous authorities were still functioning to a large extent (Gibson) and the Spanish and native government coexisted for a while as separate systems.

In 1784, Tetela del Volcán was incorporated into the Subdelegación de Cuautla and lost its status as &quot;cabecera&quot; (capital) of the district. When the administrative structure of &quot;corregimientos&quot; and &quot;alcaldías&quot; was abolished, Tetela lost its special status.

When the state of Morelos was first established, Tetela del Volcán belonged to the municipality of Ocuituco. It was established as a separate municipality on January 31, 1937, during the government of Lázaro Cárdenas. During the early period of PRI governance, municipal presidents were mostly appointed by the state governor.

After the 2006 Mexican election, Mario Soberanes (Nueva Alianza) was elected municipal president and became the first citizen of Hueyapan to be elected president of the municipality. He was also the first municipal president from a party other than the Institutional Revolutionary Party since the municipality&#x27;s founding.

There were two major earthquakes in 2017. The Chiapas earthquake on September 7 did not cause any damage in Morelos, but the 2017 Puebla earthquake centered in Axochiapan twelve days later killed 74 people in the state and caused physical damage to 20,000 buildings. Tetela del Volcán was the municipality with most severe damage, with 831 homes destroyed and 1,058 damaged.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, Tetela del Volcan blocked the entrances to the community. The state of Morelos reported 1,238 cases and 248 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of May 25, 2020; eight cases were reported in Tetela del Volcán. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. The state office of DIF sent food and water to vulnerable groups of people in eight municipalities including Tetela del Volcán on May 26. On July 2, Tetela del Volcán reported four infections but no deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Tetela reported 28 cases, 23 recuperations, and 5 deaths from the virus as of August 31. Forty-seven cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

==Monastery==
The monastery of San Juan Bautista in Tetela del Volcán is one of the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl and a UNESCO world heritage site. It was built by the Dominicans in the first half of the 16th century and was even visited by Hernán Cortés. The exterior has arcades that surround the complex but are partially hidden by trees. The upper parts of the walls around the complex are covered in paint, the lower floor of the cloister has figures depicted in the arches and walls. In the vaults over the walkways, there are numerous cherubs defeating evil spirits and some even fighting with each other. One unique architectural element is the Moorish-style wood beam roofing in the sacristy.

<doc id="732148" wikidata="Q1330254" url="?curid=732148" title="Dupuytren's contracture">
<text>Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture (also called Dupuytren&#x27;s disease, Morbus Dupuytren, Palmar fibromatosis and historically as Viking disease or Celtic hand) is a condition in which one or more fingers become permanently bent in a flexed position. It is named after Guillaume Dupuytren, who first described the underlying mechanism of action, followed by the first successful operation in 1831 and publication of the results in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1834. It usually begins as small, hard nodules just under the skin of the palm, then worsens over time until the fingers can no longer be fully straightened. While typically not painful, some aching or itching, or pain, may be present. The ring finger followed by the little and middle fingers are most commonly affected. It can affect one or both hands. The condition can interfere with activities such as preparing food, writing, putting the hand in a tight pocket, putting on gloves, or shaking hands.
The cause is unknown but might have a genetic component. Risk factors include family history, alcoholism, smoking, thyroid problems, liver disease, diabetes, previous hand trauma, and epilepsy. The underlying mechanism involves the formation of abnormal connective tissue within the palmar fascia. Diagnosis is usually based on physical examination. In some cases imaging may be indicated.

In 2020, the World Health Organization reclassified Dupuytren&#x27;s (termed palmar-type fibromatosis) as a specific type of tumor in the category of intermediate (locally aggressive) fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors.
Initial treatment is typically with cortisone injected into the affected area, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Among those who worsen, clostridial collagenase injections or surgery may be tried. Radiation therapy may be used to treat this condition. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) Faculty of Clinical Oncology concluded that radiotherapy is effective in early stage disease which has progressed within the last 6 to 12 months. The condition may recur at some time after treatment; it can then be treated again. It is easier to treat when the amount of finger bending is more mild.
It was once believed that Dupuytren&#x27;s most often occurred in white males over the age of 50 and was thought to be rare among Asians and Africans. It sometimes was called &quot;Viking disease,&quot; since it was often recorded among those of Nordic descent. In Norway, about 30% of men over 60 years old have the condition, while in the United States about 5% of people are affected at some point in time. In the United Kingdom, about 20% of people over 65 have some form of the disease.

More recent and wider studies show the highest prevalence in Africa (17 percent), Asia (15 percent).

==Signs and symptoms==

Typically, Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture first presents as a thickening or nodule in the palm, which initially can be with or without pain. Later in the disease process, which can be years later, there is increasing loss of range of motion of the affected finger(s). The earliest sign of a contracture is a triangular &quot;puckering&quot; of the skin of the palm as it passes over the flexor tendon just before the flexor crease of the finger, at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.

Dupuytren disease is generally considered painless, but can be painful if nerve tissue is involved, although this is not usually discussed in the literature. The most common finger to be affected is the ring finger; the thumb and index finger are much less often affected. 
The disease begins in the palm and moves towards the fingers, with the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints affected before the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. 
The MCP joints at the base of the finger responds much better to treatment and are usually able to fully extend after treatment. Due to anatomic differences in the ligaments and extensor tendons at the PIP joints, they may have some residual flexion. Proper patient education is necessary to set realistic treatment expectation.
In Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture, the palmar fascia within the hand becomes abnormally thick, which can cause the fingers to curl and can impair finger function. The main function of the palmar fascia is to increase grip strength; thus, over time, Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture decreases a person&#x27;s ability to hold objects and use the hand in many different activities. Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture can also be experienced as embarrassing in social situations and can affect quality of life. People may report pain, aching, and itching with the contractions. Normally, the palmar fascia consists of collagen type I, but in Dupuytren patients, the collagen changes to collagen type III, which is significantly thicker than collagen type I.

===Related conditions===
People with severe involvement often show lumps on the back of their finger joints (called &quot;Garrod&#x27;s pads&quot;, &quot;knuckle pads&quot;, or &quot;dorsal Dupuytren nodules&quot;), and lumps in the arch of the feet (plantar fibromatosis or Ledderhose disease). In severe cases, the area where the palm meets the wrist may develop lumps. It is thought the condition Peyronie&#x27;s disease is related to Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture.

In one study those with stage 2 of the disease were found to have a slightly increased risk of mortality, especially from cancer.

==Risk factors==
Many risk factors have been suggested or identified:

===Non-modifiable===
* Scandinavian or Northern European ancestry; Dupuytren&#x27;s has been called the &quot;Viking disease&quot;, though it is also widespread in some Mediterranean countries, e.g., Spain and Bosnia. Dupuytren&#x27;s is uncommon among groups including Chinese and Africans.
* In June 2023 a study found that gene variants that were inherited from Neanderthals dramatically increased the odds of developing the condition 
* Male sex; men are 80% more likely to develop the condition
* Age of 50 or over (5% to 15% of men in that group in the US); the likelihood of getting Dupuytren&#x27;s disease increases with age
* A family history (60% to 70% of those affected have a genetic predisposition to Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture)

===Modifiable===
* Smoking, especially 25-plus cigarettes per day
* Lower-than-average body mass index (thinness).
* Alcohol consumption
* Manual work: a 2023 paper by researchers at the University of Groningen Medical Centre and Oxford University, &quot;Dupuytren&#x27;s disease is a work-related disorder: results of a population-based cohort study&quot;, found that people whose jobs involved significant manual work were 1.29 times more likely to develop Dupuytren&#x27;s disease than others, with a linear dose–response relationship with cumulative manual labour over 30 years.

===Other conditions===
* Previous hand injury
* Ledderhose disease (plantar fibromatosis)
* Epilepsy (possibly due to anti-convulsive medication)
* Higher-than-average fasting blood glucose level
* Diabetes mellitus
* HIV 
* Macrophallism
* Previous myocardial infarction

==Diagnosis==
===Types===

There may be three types of Dupuytren&#x27;s disease:
* Type 1: An aggressive form of the disease found in only 3% of people with Dupuytren&#x27;s, which can affect men under 50 with a family history of Dupuytren&#x27;s. It is often associated with other symptoms such as knuckle pads and Ledderhose disease. This type is sometimes known as Dupuytren&#x27;s diathesis.
* Type 2: The more normal type of Dupuytren&#x27;s disease, usually found in the palm only, and which generally begins above the age of 50. This type may be made more severe by other factors such as diabetes or heavy manual labor.
* Type 3: A mild form of Dupuytren&#x27;s which is common among diabetics or which may also be caused by certain medications, such as the anti-convulsants taken by people with epilepsy. This type does not lead to full contracture of the fingers, and is probably not inherited.

==Treatment==
Treatment is indicated when the so-called table-top test is positive. With this test, the person places their hand on a table. If the hand lies completely flat on the table, the test is considered negative. If the hand cannot be placed completely flat on the table, leaving a space between the table and a part of the hand as big as the diameter of a ballpoint pen, the test is considered positive and surgery or other treatment may be indicated. Additionally, finger joints may become fixed and rigid. There are several types of treatment, with some hands needing repeated treatment.

The main categories listed by the International Dupuytren Society in order of stage of disease are radiation therapy, needle aponeurotomy (NA), collagenase injection, and hand surgery. the evidence on the efficacy of radiation therapy was considered inadequate in quantity and quality, and difficult to interpret because of uncertainty about the natural history of Dupuytren&#x27;s disease.

Needle aponeurotomy is most effective for Stages I and II, covering 6–90 degrees of deformation of the finger. However, it is also used at other stages.
Collagenase injection is likewise most effective for Stages I and II. However, it is also used at other stages.

Hand surgery is effective at stage I to stage IV.

Use of a splint to keep treated fingers straight following various forms of treatment, typically at all times for some days, then at nighttime for some weeks, is usual. However, a 2015 Cochrane review concluded: &quot;low-quality evidence suggests that postoperative splinting may not improve outcomes and may impair outcomes by reducing active flexion. Further trials on this topic are urgently required&quot;.

=== Surgery ===
On 12 June 1831, Dupuytren performed a surgical procedure on a person with contracture of the fourth and fifth digits who had been previously told by other surgeons that the only remedy was cutting the flexor tendons. He described the condition and the operation in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1834 after presenting it in 1833, and posthumously in 1836 in a French publication by Hôtel-Dieu de Paris. The procedure he described was a minimally invasive needle procedure.

Because of high recurrence rates, new surgical techniques were introduced, such as fasciectomy and then dermofasciectomy. Most of the diseased tissue is removed with these procedures. For some individuals, the partial insertion of &quot;K-wires&quot; into either the DIP or PIP joint of the affected digit for a period of a least 21 days to fuse the joint is the only way to halt the disease&#x27;s progress. After removal of the wires, the joint is fixed into flexion, which is considered preferable to fusion at extension.

Research using large datasets in the UK has shown surgery to be safe and effective. When surgery needs to be repeated, however, the research suggests there are higher risks of serious complications such as finger amputation. Amputation of fingers may be needed for severe or recurrent cases or after surgical complications.

====Limited fasciectomy====

Limited/selective fasciectomy removes the pathological tissue, and is a common approach. A 2015 Cochrane review reported that low-quality evidence suggested that fasciectomy may be more effective for people with advanced Dupuytren&#x27;s contractures.

During the procedure, the person is under regional or general anesthesia. A surgical tourniquet prevents blood flow to the limb. The skin is often opened with a zig-zag incision but straight incisions with or without Z-plasty are also described and may reduce damage to neurovascular bundles. All diseased cords and fascia are excised. The excision has to be very precise to spare the neurovascular bundles. Because not all the diseased tissue is visible macroscopically, complete excision is uncertain.

A 20-year review of surgical complications associated with fasciectomy showed that major complications occurred in 15.7% of cases, including digital nerve injury (3.4%), digital artery injury (2%), infection (2.4%), hematoma (2.1%), and complex regional pain syndrome (5.5%), in addition to minor complications including painful flare reactions in 9.9% of cases and wound healing complications in 22.9% of cases. After the tissue is removed the incision is closed. In the case of a shortage of skin, the transverse part of the zig-zag incision is left open. Stitches are removed 10 days after surgery.

After surgery, the hand is wrapped in a light compressive bandage for one week. Flexion and extension of the fingers can start as soon as the anaesthesia has resolved. It is common to experience tingling within the first week after surgery. Hand therapy is often recommended. Approximately six weeks after surgery the patient is able completely to use the hand.

The average recurrence rate is 39% after a fasciectomy after a median interval of about four years.

====Wide-awake fasciectomy====

Limited/selective fasciectomy under local anesthesia (LA) with epinephrine but no tourniquet is possible. In 2005, Denkler described the technique.

====Dermofasciectomy====
Dermofasciectomy is a surgical procedure that may be used when:
* The skin is clinically involved (pits, tethering, deficiency, etc.)
* The risk of recurrence is high and the skin appears uninvolved (subclinical skin involvement occurs in ~50% of cases)
* Recurrent disease. Similar to a limited fasciectomy, the dermofasciectomy removes diseased cords, fascia, and the overlying skin.

Typically, the excised skin is replaced with a skin graft, usually full thickness, consisting of the epidermis and the entire dermis. In most cases the graft is taken from the antecubital fossa (the crease of skin at the elbow joint) or the inner side of the upper arm. This place is chosen because the skin color best matches the palm&#x27;s skin color. The skin on the inner side of the upper arm is thin and has enough skin to supply a full-thickness graft. The donor site can be closed with a direct suture.

The graft is sutured to the skin surrounding the wound. For one week the hand is protected with a dressing. The hand and arm are elevated with a sling. The dressing is then removed and careful mobilization can be started, gradually increasing in intensity. After this procedure the risk of recurrence is minimised, but Dupuytren&#x27;s can recur in the skin graft and complications from surgery may occur.

====Segmental fasciectomy with/without cellulose====
Segmental fasciectomy involves excising part(s) of the contracted cord so that it disappears or no longer contracts the finger. It is less invasive than the limited fasciectomy, because not all the diseased tissue is excised and the skin incisions are smaller.

The person is placed under regional anesthesia and a surgical tourniquet is used. The skin is opened with small curved incisions over the diseased tissue. If necessary, incisions are made in the fingers. Pieces of cord and fascia of approximately one centimeter are excised. The cords are placed under maximum tension while they are cut. A scalpel is used to separate the tissues. The surgeon keeps removing small parts until the finger can fully extend. The patient is encouraged to start moving their hand the day after surgery. After surgery people wear a light pressure dressing for four days, followed by an extension splint, typically continuously for a few weeks, then every night for eight weeks.

The same procedure is used in the segmental fasciectomy with cellulose implant. After the excision and a careful hemostasis, the cellulose implant is placed in a single layer in between the remaining parts of the cord.

===Less invasive treatments===
Studies have been conducted for percutaneous release, extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy with lipografting and collagenase. These treatments show promise.

====Percutaneous needle fasciotomy====
Needle aponeurotomy is a minimally-invasive technique where the cords are weakened through the insertion and manipulation of a small needle. It is applicable only if the contracture is clearly visible. The hand is first numbed by injection with local anaesthetic. The cord is then sectioned at as many levels as possible in the palm and fingers, depending on the location and extent of the disease, using perhaps a 25-gauge needle mounted on a 10 ml syringe. Once weakened, the offending cords can be snapped by putting tension on the finger(s) and pulling the finger(s) straight. After the treatment a small dressing is applied for 24 hours, after which people are able to use their hands normally. No splints or physiotherapy are given.

The advantage of needle aponeurotomy is the minimal intervention without incision (done in the office under local anesthesia) and the very rapid return to normal activities without need for rehabilitation, but the nodules may resume growing. A study reported postoperative gain is greater at the MCP joint level than at the level of the IP-joint and found a reoperation rate of 24%; complications are scarce. Needle aponeurotomy may be performed on fingers that are severely bent (stage IV), and not just in early stages. A 2003 study showed 85% recurrence rate after five years.

A comprehensive review of the results of needle aponeurotomy in 1,013 fingers was performed by Gary M. Pess, MD, Rebecca Pess, DPT, and Rachel Pess, PsyD, and published in the &quot;Journal of Hand Surgery&quot; April 2012. Minimal follow-up was three years. Metacarpophalangeal joint (MP) contractures were corrected at an average of 99% and proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) contractures at an average of 89% immediately post procedure. At final follow-up, 72% of the correction was maintained for MP joints and 31% for PIP joints. The difference between the final corrections for MP versus PIP joints was statistically significant. When comparing people aged below and above 55 years of age there was a statistically significant difference at both MP and PIP joints, with greater correction maintained in the older group.

Gender differences were not statistically significant. Needle aponeurotomy provided successful correction to 5° or less contracture immediately post procedure in 98% (791) of MP joints and 67% (350) of PIP joints. There was recurrence of 20° or less over the original post-procedure corrected level in 80% (646) of MP joints and 35% (183) of PIP joints. Complications were rare except for skin tears, which occurred in 3.4% (34) of digits. This study showed that NA is a safe procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. The complication rate was low, but recurrences were frequent in younger people and for PIP contractures.

====Extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy and lipografting====
A technique introduced in 2011 is extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy with lipografting. This procedure also uses a needle to cut the cords. The difference with the percutaneous needle fasciotomy is that the cord is cut at many places. The cord is also separated from the skin to make place for the lipograft that is taken from the abdomen or ipsilateral flank. This technique shortens the recovery time. The fat graft results in supple skin.

Before the aponeurotomy, a liposuction is done to the abdomen and ipsilateral flank to collect the lipograft. The treatment can be performed under regional or general anesthesia. The digits are placed under maximal extension tension using a firm lead hand retractor. The surgeon makes multiple palmar puncture wounds with small nicks. The tension on the cords is crucial, because tight constricting bands are most susceptible to be cut and torn by the small nicks, whereas the relatively loose neurovascular structures are spared. After the cord is completely cut and separated from the skin the lipograft is injected under the skin. A total of about 5 to 10 ml is injected per ray.

After the treatment the person wears an extension splint for 5 to 7 days. Thereafter the person returns to normal activities and is advised to use a night splint for up to 20 weeks.

====Collagenase====
The cords are weakened through the injection of small amounts of the enzyme collagenase, which breaks peptide bonds in collagen.

Clostridial collagenase injections have been found to be more effective than placebo.

In February 2010 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved injectable collagenase extracted from &quot;Clostridium histolyticum&quot; for the treatment of Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture in adults with a palpable Dupuytren&#x27;s cord. (Three years later, it was approved as well for the treatment of the sometimes related Peyronie&#x27;s disease.) In 2011 its use for the treatment of Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture was approved as well by the European Medicines Agency, and it received similar approval in Australia in 2013. However, the Swedish manufacturer withdrew distribution of this drug in Europe including the UK, Australia, and Asia in March 2020. (It is also used in the US as a dermatological treatment for cellulite aka &quot;cottage cheese thighs&quot;).

The treatment with collagenase is different for the MCP joint and the PIP joint. In a MCP joint contracture the needle must be placed at the point of maximum bowstringing of the palpable cord. The needle is placed vertically on the bowstring. The collagenase is distributed across three injection points. For the PIP joint the needle must be placed not more than 4 mm distal to palmar digital crease at 2–3 mm depth. The injection for PIP consists of one injection filled with 0.58 mg CCH 0.20 ml. The needle must be placed horizontal to the cord and also uses a three-point distribution. After the injection the person&#x27;s hand is wrapped in bulky gauze dressing and must be elevated for the rest of the day. After 24 hours the person returns for passive digital extension to rupture the cord. Moderate pressure for 10–20 seconds ruptures the cord. After the treatment with collagenase the person should use a night splint and perform digital flexion/extension exercises several times per day for 4 months.

===Radiation therapy===

Radiation therapy has been used mostly for early-stage disease, but is unproven. Evidence to support its use , however, was scarce—efforts to gather evidence are complicated due to a poor understanding of how the condition develops over time. It has been studied in early disease. The Royal College of Radiologists concluded that radiotherapy is effective in early stage disease which has progressed within the last 6 to 12 months.

===Alternative medicine===
Several alternate therapies such as vitamin E treatment have been studied, though without control groups. Most doctors do not value those treatments. None of these treatments stops or cures the condition permanently. A 1949 study of vitamin E therapy found that &quot;In twelve of the thirteen patients there was no evidence whatever of any alteration. ... The treatment has been abandoned.&quot;

Laser treatment (using red and infrared at low power) was informally discussed in 2013 at an International Dupuytren Society forum, as of which time little or no formal evaluation of the techniques had been completed. In 2021 improvement of Dupuytren&#x27;s disease in a single patient by treatment with a fractionated CO₂ laser was reported.

===Postoperative care===
Postoperative care involves hand therapy and splinting. Hand therapy is prescribed to optimize post-surgical function and to prevent joint stiffness. The extent of hand therapy is depending on the patient and the corrective procedure.

Besides hand therapy, many surgeons advise the use of static or dynamic splints after surgery to maintain finger mobility. The splint is used to provide prolonged stretch to the healing tissues and prevent flexion contractures. Although splinting is a widely used post-operative intervention, evidence of its effectiveness is limited, leading to variation in splinting approaches. Most surgeons use clinical experience to decide whether to splint. Cited advantages include maintenance of finger extension and prevention of new flexion contractures. Cited disadvantages include joint stiffness, prolonged pain, discomfort, subsequently reduced function and edema.

A third approach emphasizes early self-exercise and stretching.

==Prognosis==
Dupuytren&#x27;s disease has a high recurrence rate, especially when a person has so-called Dupuytren&#x27;s diathesis. The term diathesis relates to certain features of Dupuytren&#x27;s disease, and indicates an aggressive course of disease.

The presence of all new Dupuytren&#x27;s diathesis factors increases the risk of recurrent Dupuytren&#x27;s disease by 71%, compared with a baseline risk of 23% in people lacking the factors. In another study the prognostic value of diathesis was evaluated. It was concluded that presence of diathesis can predict recurrence and extension. A scoring system was made to evaluate the risk of recurrence and extension, based on the following values: bilateral hand involvement, little-finger surgery, early onset of disease, plantar fibrosis, knuckle pads, and radial side involvement.

Minimally invasive therapies may precede higher recurrence rates. Recurrence lacks a consensus definition. Furthermore, different standards and measurements follow from the various definitions.

<text>Tlalnepantla is the name of a city and a municipality in the Mexican state of Morelos.

The city reported a population of 3,872 inhabitants, while its municipality reported 7,166 inhabitants in the 2015 census. It is the least populous of the 17 municipalities that border Mexico City, bordering the capital city&#x27;s southeastern Milpa Alta borough. Tlalnepantla is located 57 kilometers (35 miles) northeast of Cuernavaca.

==Name==
The name Tlalnepantla means &quot;In the middle of the lands&quot; in Nahuatl, which may be interpreted as &quot;In the middle of the mountains&quot;. According to Reyes and Robelo this town was originally called Tlalnepantla Kuauhtenko; this second place name means &quot;On the shore of the eagles&quot;; its etymology from &quot;Kuauh-tli&quot;, &quot;eagle&quot;; &quot;ten-tli&quot;, &quot;shore or lip&quot;, and &quot;ko&quot;, adverb of &quot;place&quot;; however, in the hieroglyph the sign of the tree is clearly seen between two parts of the earth. It is supposed to be related to the terrestrial meridian, nearly the same as the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral.

==The municipality==

===Towns and villages===
The largest localities (cities, towns, and villages) are:
Other communities include Fraccionamiento Calmil, Campo Aguacomulco, Bosques de Morelos, Campo Jazmín, and Fraccionamiento los Robles.

==History==
Ruins of settlements of Nahuas and Nahuatl-speaking Tlahuicas have been found since before the founding of Tlalnepantla.

By the 1590s a town called Teocaltitla was established northwest about seven kilometers from the present municipal seat. Ruins of its church, including plaster, can still be seen. The ruins of the town of San Bartolomé (&quot;Cohamilpa&quot;) are located about four kilometers west of Tlalnepantla. Ruins of the San Nicolás Tolentino neighborhood (&quot;Teopancasholtitla&quot;), founded in 1600, are located six kilometers from Tlalnepantla. San Felipe, also founded in the 1600s, is located five kilometers away.

Tlalnepantla-Cuahutenco was formed by Fray Toribio and Fray Juan de Zumárraga between 1680 and 1690 by grouping the people into five &quot;barrios&quot;—San Pedro, San Felipe, San Nicolás, San Bartolo, Santiagoof—with about 800 people each. It took the simpler name Tlalnepantla in 1869.

Construction of the convent and the parish of the Purification was begun by the Augustinians in the 16th century and completed in 1791. The former monastery of the Precious Blood of Christ also dates from the same time. The church was burned during the Mexican War of Independence and was renovated in 1933.

Tlalnepantla became a municipal seat in the State of Mexico on October 11, 1848. It became part of Morelos on April 17, 1869.

A telephone line was established between 1880 and 1910 near Tenecuilco where President Porfirio Díaz had a hunting lodge. On one occasion, the president got lost, only to be saved by a local resident named Bonifacio Rodríguez. In gratitude for saving his life, the president gave Rodríguez his telephone number, which was quite useful later when Rodríguez was arrested in a drunken brawl. Ciriaco Espíndola, also from Tenecuilco, became Díaz&#x27;s secretary from 1880-1900 and his brother Dolores Espíndola worked as administrator of the Mexican Railway.

The ex-hacienda of Cuatepec or Coatepec was built during colonial times. During the Mexican Revolution the hacienda was looted and burned, then abandoned by its owner. The peasants divided the land and the community adopted the name of General Felipe Neri, a Zapatista who was killed by rival general Antonio Barona Rojas. The town&#x27;s foundation is celebrated on February 8.

The first carnaval in Tlalnepantla was organized by Pablo Lima in 1905; &quot;carnaval&quot; was suspended during the Revolution and started again in 1929.

El Vigía, also called San Nicolás del Monte, was formed by uniting the barrios of San Miguel, San Francisco, San Pedro, and San Lucas. San Nicolás del Monte was isolated until Mexican Federal Highway 113 was built in 1973. The town changed its name to El Vigía in 1973 because during the Revolution it was used to warn people when enemy armies were approaching. El Pedregal was founded by Teofilo Pacheco in 1975.

At least 340 homes were damaged during the 2017 Puebla earthquake, but no deaths or injuries were reported in the municipality.

Rigoberto Espindola Gonzalez of the Panal was elected Presidente Municipal on July 1, 2018.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; one case was reported in Tlatnapantla. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On July 2, Tlalnepantla reported 33 infections and four deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Tlalnepantla reported 19 cases, 18 recuperations, and two deaths from the virus as of August 31. Twenty/one cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

Approximately 16% of the total surface is rugged, 78% is semi-flat, and 0.5% is flat (mostly in the north, west, and southeast).

===Water resources===
There are no rivers or streams in Tlalnepantla. Rainwater is caught in the canyons and gullies of Cuatizec, Tlatenchi, Teshohuaca, and Tepeclapa. There is an average of of annual precipitation.

===Climate===
The climate in the municipality is temperate sub-humid, with an average annual temperature of and an average annual rainfall of . Tlalnepantla is one of the municipalities with the highest annual precipitation.

===Flora===
Flora consists mainly of Temperate coniferous forest: pine, oak, fir, ash, elm, tejocote (a fruit tree), and ocotillo (a shrub). There is a wide variety of medicinal plants such as squaw mint (for stomach pain), lemon balm (taken as tea), tochete (mint), tabaquillo, mullein (used to heal wounds), and Valerian (herb) (for rheumatism).

===Natural resources===
Agricultural land and forests are the most important natural resources.

===Soil===
Most soils consist of humus and clay. Of the , (38%) are used for farming. Forest consists of or 61% of the land, while the rest is used for buildings.

==Economy==
The main economic activity of this is agriculture, of which 89% is the cultivation of prickly pears or nopales. Both the fruit and the leaves are sold in Mexico City, Monterrey, Tijuana, and even the United States. Corn and tomatoes, which were once staple crops, now take second place to this cactus. Fruit trees were introduced by Spanish missionaries, and some fruit, particularly avocados, peaches, and pears are still gown today. Livestock are also raised.

There is controlled logging of the forests and a significant amount of wood is exploited. There are some fields for growing Christmas trees.

;Music
There are four brass bands that regularly play at fairs in Tlalnepantla. Tropical music, cumbias, and Norteño music are also popular.

;Dance
Chinelos began in Tlayacapan but are now popular at carnivals and fairs throughout the region. The Chinelos costume consists of four main items: a long flowing robe made of velvet which usually has a rectangular shape tunic, a mask, a large plumed hat, and gloves. The masks are made of mesh and feature an upturned beard and European features.

===Food===
Nopales were introduced to Tlalnepantla about forty years ago, and today they can form the basis of many local dishes: sandwiches of nopal, nopales with cecina, tamales of nopal, and eggs with nopales, to name a few. Mole Verde, mole with chicken or pumpkin seed, and cecina with cheese are also traditional foods.

<doc id="732152" wikidata="Q145445" url="?curid=732152" title="Polybutylene terephthalate">
<text>Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) is a thermoplastic engineering polymer that is used as an insulator in the electrical and electronics industries. It is a thermoplastic (semi-)crystalline polymer, and a type of polyester. PBT resists solvents, shrinks very little during forming, is mechanically strong, is heat-resistant up to (or with glass-fibre reinforcement), and can be treated with flame retardants to make it noncombustible. It was developed by Britain&#x27;s Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).

PBT is closely related to other thermoplastic polyesters. Compared to PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PBT has slightly lower strength and rigidity, slightly better impact resistance, and a slightly lower glass transition temperature. PBT and PET are sensitive to hot water above (140 °F). PBT and PET need UV protection if used outdoors, and most grades of these polyesters are flammable, although additives can be used to improve both UV and flammability properties.

PBT is produced by the polymerization of 1,4-butanediol and terephthalic acid.

==Applications==
Polybutylene terephthalate is used for housings in electrical engineering, but also in automotive construction as plug connectors and in households for example in showerheads or irons. It is also found processed into toothbrush fibers and false eyelashes and is used in the keycaps of some high-end computer keyboards because the texture is highly resistant to wear and the plastic is less vulnerable to ultraviolet degradation and discoloration than the conventional ABS alternative.

PBT can also be made into yarn. This has a natural stretch similar to Lycra and can be incorporated into sportswear. Due to its chlorine resistance it is commonly found in swimwear. Further, recent studies have shown that PBT has superior UV properties to PET based fabrics such as T400.

PBT, especially glass fibre grades, can be effectively fire-retarded with halogen-free products. Phosphorus-based flame retardant systems are used in these fire-safe polymers and are based on aluminium diethyl phosphinate and synergists. They are designed to meet UL 94 flammability tests as well as Glow Wire Ignition Tests (GWIT), Glow Wire Flammability Test (GWFI) and Comparative Tracking Index (CTI). Main applications are in the electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) industry.

This facility is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, which categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year). As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 122,192 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 107,595 enplanements in 2009, and 121,468 in 2010.

== History ==
In 1943, land was purchased from the state of Arizona for construction of Davis Dam power plant that was initiated by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1947. In 1943, the airport was established on Bureau of Land Management property about two miles south of the Davis Dam power plant construction site. The employees of the Davis Dam project graded and used the airport. In 1953, the dam was completed, and residential development commenced in Bullhead City, Lake Mohave and Mohave Valley areas. Mohave County leased the Bullhead City Airport from BLM in 1968, and in 1971 the county subleased a portion of the Bullhead Airport to Bullhead Airport Inc., a private enterprise which provided fixed-base operation services.

In 1972, ADOT provided a $15,000 grant to aid in an airport improvement project for runway relocation, drainage, marking, lighting and fencing. In 1979, a new 25-year lease for the entire 135 acre airport was negotiated by the county with the newly formed Mohave County Airport Authority. In 1980, the Bullhead Airport Inc. sublease was renegotiated and ADOT provided $91,000 to overlay the old aircraft parking apron and extend it to the north. The FBO provided $10,000 to make other facility improvements. In 1983 BLM transferred airport property to the state of Arizona. In 1986 the Arizona State Land Department sold property that included the airport parcel to Bullhead Airport Inc through public auction with two stipulations. The buyer would have to dedicate 433 acres to Mohave County for airport use, and the buyer would need to complete a flood control project within two years of land purchase. In 1987 FAA and ADOT grants and entitlements were used to commence construction, and Mohave County Airport Authority formed two executive committees, one for Kingman and one for Bullhead/Laughlin. A whole new facility was then constructed on the east side of the original airport, opening in the early 1990s. The new facility included a much longer runway able to accommodate large jet traffic. The airport name was then changed to the current Laughlin/Bullhead City International Airport and a new IATA/FAA code of &quot;IFP&quot; was adopted, for &quot;International Fun Place&quot;. The previous code had been &quot;BHC&quot; for &quot;Bullhead City Airport&quot;. 
=== Historical passenger service ===
During the 1980s the airport was served extensively by several commuter airlines including StatesWest Airlines, Mesa Airlines, Sun West Airlines, Air L.A., Golden Pacific Airlines, Scenic Airlines and Havasu Airlines which briefly operated under a code-share with Braniff. Flights were mainly operated to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and throughout Southern California. By the early 1990s, several of the commuter airlines began code-sharing with major airlines which included America West Express operated by Mesa Airlines, United Express, also operated by Mesa Airlines, and USAir Express, operated by StatesWest Airlines. All were operating Beechcraft 1900 commuter propjets and USAir Express briefly operated de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops to Los Angeles. Upon opening of the new facility in 1993, airlines such as Air Laughlin, Vanguard Airlines, and Viscount Air Services began operating Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9 charter flights from Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) in Phoenix. According to the Official Airline Guide, by February 1993 Morris Air began operating scheduled nonstop service between the airport and Salt Lake City (SLC) and later to San Francisco (SFO) with Boeing 737-300 jets. By December, 1993, Morris Air was operating scheduled nonstop Boeing 737-300 service between the airport and Oakland (OAK) and San Jose (SJC) as well as SLC. According to the April 1994 edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Morris Air left the airport on June 5, 1994 and six months later Reno Air began service with McDonnell Douglas MD-80 flights five days a week from San Jose International Airport (SJC). Reno Air&#x27;s jet service was also short-lived, ending on May 21, 1997. America West Express and United Express continued to operate propjets with nonstop and direct one stop service from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), nonstop flights from Long Beach Airport (LGB), nonstop flights from Ontario International Airport (ONT), and nonstop and direct service from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX). Many flights to Phoenix would stop at Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Other commuter airlines that briefly served the Laughlin/Bullhead City Airport in the 1990s include Arizona Airways with nonstop flights from Tucson International Airport (TUS) as well as direct one stop flights from Albuquerque (ABQ). Pacific Coast Airlines provided service to San Diego and Eagle Canyon Airlines to Las Vegas. A number of flights, especially those operated with mainline jet aircraft, were offered in conjunction with hotel packages. FedEx Express became the airport&#x27;s main cargo airline during that decade. United Express ended their commuter flights to Los Angeles on November 9, 1996 and America West Express service to Phoenix ended in June, 2001. 

In 2002, Sun Country Airlines initiated new jet service to Bullhead City from Minneapolis/St Paul, MN (MSP). The airline ultimately decided to make Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport a small hub for the southwestern U.S. region. In 2004 Ryan International Airlines returned the chartered jet services from the Phoenix area, flying between Bullhead City and the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (AZA), with McDonnell Douglas MD-82 jetliners. Passenger service was also operated by Western Express Air to Phoenix Deer Valley Airport in Arizona as well as Riverside Municipal Airport (RAL) in California with small commuter turboprop aircraft; however, these flights ended when that airline ceased operations at the end of May 2007.

The airport briefly saw a return in scheduled commercial service from February 16, 2017 through February 14, 2018, when American Eagle, operating via a code sharing agreement on behalf of American Airlines, provided a single daily flight to and from Phoenix (PHX) using a Bombardier CRJ700 series regional jet. However, this service proved to be unprofitable and was terminated after one year. The airport currently does not have any scheduled passenger service although regular casino charter flights provided by Sun Country Airlines and Allegiant Air continue to utilize the airport.

=== Airport upgrades ===
In 2008, the airport got a multimillion-dollar expansion and a heightened security system. During the same year, the largest aircraft ever to visit the airport, a Boeing 747SP widebody jetliner, landed on the recently expanded runway.

=== Past airshows ===
In March 2010 the airport hosted &quot;Legends Over the Colorado&quot;, an air show with additional displays of an original Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress from World War II. The plane is part of the Commemorative Air Force Arizona Wing of the Commemorative Air Force, a Texas-based nonprofit organization that has fully restored the B-17 Flying Fortress &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;. Also on display were a North American T-6 Texan and four other warbirds.

On April 9–10, 2011, Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport held the second annual &quot;Legends Over the Colorado&quot;. The main attraction was &quot;FIFI&quot;, the only flying Boeing B-29 Superfortress in the world along with two North American P-51 Mustangs, a Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero, and several other World War II-era warbirds.

=== Upgraded baggage facility ===
On July 20, 2011 marked the opening of the new baggage claim building connected to the main terminal.

=== Passenger charter traffic in 2016 ===
More than 109,000 people flew into Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport on casino-sponsored charter flights in 2016. 

== Facilities ==
Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 16/34 with an asphalt surface measuring . The runway was recently reconstructed. Paid for by grants, actual site preparation was due to begin in 2013, and the date of completion was set for some time in 2013.
Site preparation and drainage for extending runway 16/34 1000 ft. was completed in early 2016. Phase 2 of the Runway 16/34 &amp; Taxiway extension project was completed in early 2017, which included a 1000 ft extension of the runway and taxiway A, the addition of taxiway A9, and electrical improvements. Runway 16/34 is now 8,500 ft x 150 ft.

A taxiway extends the length of the runway, connected seven taxiways. Taxiway A3, a high speed taxiway, is often used when landing to the north on Runway 34, as it leads to the terminal apron.

A rotating beacon is located to the east of the runway near mid-field, on top of the air traffic control tower. The beacon operates during night hours, and when instrument meteorological conditions exist at the airport. The runway and taxiways have medium intensity lighting systems (MILS). Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are at each end of the runway, as well as lights showing the end of the threshold. A Precision Approach Path Indicator system is at each end. &quot;Lighted airfield signs at [IFP] are at aircraft hold positions, taxiway intersections, and at the intersection of the connecting taxiways and runways&quot;. There are also mandatory hold signs. The medium intensity runway lighting can be turned on by a pilot clicking the radio transmission button in the cockpit. Airfield markings control the traffic efficiently on the ground. Runway 16/34 has centerline, threshold markings, aiming points, and runway designation markings. Taxiways have hold short markings before runway intersections and centerlines. The airport&#x27;s aprons have centerlines to control traffic and designated tie down areas. A segmented circle is located to the west of the runway, mid-field, for visual reference on how a pilot should fly the traffic pattern for the runway.

IFP has features that allow pilots in the area to be better informed of weather at the airport. These provide accurate and up-to-date weather information. Three lighted wind socks show wind directions and approximate speed. An Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) was installed in 2007 and records weather data such as wind speed, wind gusts, wind direction, variable wind direction, temperature, dew point, altimeter setting, density altitude, visibility, variable visibility, precipitation, sky condition, and cloud height. The AWOS data can be heard in an aircraft if the pilot tunes in to 119.825 on the radio controls.

Three main navigational aids assist pilots with navigation: very high frequency omnidirectional range facilities (VOR), a Loran-C, and a global positioning system (GPS). These can only be used with properly equipped aircraft. Although IFP does not have a VOR on the field, there are three at airports nearby: Kingman VOR/DME (distance measuring equipment) is to the east, Needles VORTAC (military tactical air navigational aids) is to the south, and Goffs VORTAC is to the west. GPS does not need facilities on the ground for navigational guidance because it uses satellites orbiting the Earth to triangulate the aircraft&#x27;s position. Loran-C basically works the same way as a GPS, but with ground-based facilities around the country. Therefore, IFP does not have any navigational aids on airport property.

IFP has three instrument approaches. Runway 16 has a GPS approach. Runway 34 has a GPS approach and a VOR approach using the Needles VORTAC. The GPS approach provides vertical guidance as well as course (horizontal) guidance. The Needles VORTAC approach only gives pilots course guidance. Runway 34&#x27;s GPS approach provides the lowest minimums for the airport. The FAA approach plate for this instrument approach is shown in Appendix B. The GPS LPV approach allows aircraft to come down to about 640 feet above ground level (AGL). All landing traffic in VFR weather is kept to the west of the airfield. Right-turning traffic is for Runway 16 and left-turning traffic is for Runway 34.

An airport traffic control tower is used to control traffic on the ground at IFP and in the vicinity. It is only operational from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Mountain Standard Time, the local time zone. The control tower is stationed at about midfield on the east side. When the control tower is closed, area traffic use the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). During non-towered hours, landing traffic operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) are controlled by the Los Angeles air route traffic control facility.

There are numerous landside facilities at IFP. A terminal that has ticket sales, security screening, rental car services, and airport administration is on the north side of the apron, connected to the departure holdroom by a covered walkway. There are no actual gates. Passengers walk out to their planes from the holdroom. Both of those use a pair of parking lots that have about 400 spaces. A rescue and firefighting building holds a rescue/firefighting vehicle as well as maintenance vehicles. There are also a charter bus loading area, a fuel farm owned and operated by Signature Flight Support which offers Jet A and 100LL, and 34 hangars ranging widely in sizes.

=== Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting Department ===
In October 1991, Station 4 was opened at the Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport and was staffed full-time by the Bullhead City Fire Department. In 1997, the Mohave County Airport Authority (MCAA) elected to establish its own Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) department in order to currently maintain an ARFF Index of &quot;B&quot;. This department currently employs six firefighters, and the station is staffed twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. In September 2011, the Mohave County Airport Authority was awarded two airport improvement grants totaling $7.6 million from the Federal Aviation Administration. One of these grants was for construction of a new ARFF facility and the purchase of a new 2013 Oshkosh Striker ARFF apparatus.

=== Aircraft ===
For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2016, the airport had 26,726 aircraft operations, an average of 73 per day: 23% general aviation, 9% air taxi, 4% scheduled commercial, and 64% military. At that time there were 22 aircraft based at this airport: 69% single-engine, 17% helicopter, 14% multi-engine, and 0% jet.

== In popular culture ==
The airport is seen as the departing airport for a &quot;Sierra Airlines&quot; flight to Fresno in the opening scenes of the 2003 comedy film &quot;View from the Top&quot;.

From 2003 and until 2020 it functioned as part of the European Union and European Statistical System&#x27;s geocode standard Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics or NUTS.

Following Brexit, the ONS set to develop a domestic statistical classification framework separate from NUTS. Currently, the ITLs are a mirror to the pre-existing NUTS system, they retain the same three level hierarchy and boundaries used for NUTS in the United Kingdom since 2018, with the next review scheduled for 2024. ITLs are set to follow a similar review timetable to NUTS, being reviewed every three years. The ONS will develop new official GSS codes of ITL geography aligned with the existing NUTS codes. From 1 January 2021, the ONS encourages &quot;ITL&quot; be used as a replacement to the &quot;NUTS&quot; designation, with lookups between NUTS and ITL maintained and published until 2023.

The current ITL classification is a mirror of the previous NUTS classification with slight modification, the ONS lists 12 regions at ITL 1, 41 regions at ITL 2, and 179 regions at ITL 3. &quot;UK&quot; in the NUTS codes were replaced with &quot;TL&quot;.

The last NUTS classification is dated 21 November 2016 and was effective from 1 January 2018, listed 12 regions at NUTS 1, 40 regions at NUTS 2, and 174 regions at NUTS 3 level.

The 12 ITL regions of the United Kingdom are listed below. Population numbers are for mid-2019 (as NUTS 1), and areas are in square kilometres. Data is from the Office for National Statistics.

== History ==

=== NUTS 2003 ===

In the first version in 2003, North Eastern Scotland (which then included part of Moray) was coded UKM1, and Highlands and Islands was coded UKM4.

The current NUTS level 1 codes start with &quot;C&quot; (following &quot;UK&quot;) rather than &quot;1&quot; because the new list reflected the revised regions of England and local government changes throughout the UK; &quot;1&quot; to &quot;B&quot; had been used for the 11 regions in the previous coding system.

=== NUTS 2006 ===

NUTS 2006 came into force on 1 January 2008.

=== NUTS 2010 ===

NUTS 2010 came into force on 1 January 2012.

2010 changes to NUTS 2 also resulting in changes with NUTS 3 regions

* The combined area of UKD2 (Cheshire pre-2010) and UKD5 (Merseyside pre-2010) were replaced by UKD6 (Cheshire post-2010) and UKD7 (Merseyside post-2010), due to the transfer of Halton to the Merseyside NUTS region from Cheshire. This resulted in the following changes to the underlying NUTS 3 areas: UKD22 (Cheshire CC) being split into UKD62 (Cheshire East) and UKD63 (Cheshire West and Chester); The areas of Liverpool, Sefton and Wirral were not changed as NUTS 3 areas however to reflect their transfer within NUTS 2 areas were respectively renumbered from (UKD52 to UKD72; UKD53 to UKD 73 and UKD54 to UKD 74). The two areas of UKD51 (East Merseyside pre 2010) and UKD21 (Halton and Warrington) were amended by the transfer of Halton from the latter to former to form the new areas of UKD71 (East Merseyside post-2010) and UKD61 (Warrington).

== Local administrative units ==
Below the ITL levels, the two LAU (Local Administrative Units) levels are:

The two LAU levels are maintained by the UK Office for National Statistics within the ONS coding system.
