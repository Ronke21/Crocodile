<text>A transit of Phobos across the Sun as seen from Mars takes place when Phobos passes directly between the Sun and a point on the surface of Mars, obscuring a large part of the Sun&#x27;s disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Phobos can be seen from Mars as a large black disc rapidly moving across the face of the Sun. At the same time, the shadow (antumbra) of Phobos moves across the Martian surface.

The event could also be regarded as a particularly quick and shallow annular solar eclipse by Phobos.

== Transit ==

A transit of Phobos from Mars usually lasts only thirty seconds or so, due to the moon&#x27;s very rapid orbital period of approximately 7.6 hours. 

Because Phobos orbits close to Mars and in line with its equator, transits of Phobos occur somewhere on Mars on most days of the Martian year. Its orbital inclination is 1.08°, so the latitude of its shadow projected onto the Martian surface shows a seasonal variation, moving from 70.4°S to 70.4°N and back again over the course of a Martian year. Phobos is so close to Mars that it is not visible south of 70.4°S or north of 70.4°N; for some days in the year, its shadow misses the surface entirely and falls north or south of Mars.

At any given geographical location on the surface of Mars, there are two intervals in a Martian year when the shadow of Phobos or Deimos is passing through its latitude. During each such interval, about half a dozen transits of Phobos can be seen by observers at that geographical location (compared to zero or one transits of Deimos). Transits of Phobos happen during Martian autumn and winter in the respective hemisphere; close to the equator they happen around the March and September equinoxes, while farther from the equator they happen closer to the winter solstice.

Observers at high latitudes (but less than 70.4°) will see a noticeably smaller angular diameter for Phobos because they are considerably farther away from it than observers at Mars&#x27;s equator. As a result, transits of Phobos for such observers will cover less of the Sun&#x27;s disk. Because it orbits so close to Mars, Phobos cannot be seen north of 70.4°N or south of 70.4°S; observers at such latitudes will obviously not see transits, either.

Mars Rover &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover (MER-B) had photographed some transits of Phobos on 7, 10 and 12 March 2004. In the captions as seen below, the first row shows Earth time UTC, and the second row shows Martian local solar time.


The data in the tables below is generated using JPL Horizons. There is some small discrepancy with the times reported for the series of images above. This may be due to imprecision in the ephemeris data used by JPL Horizons; also the JPL Horizons data gives local apparent solar time while the times reported above are probably some form of mean solar time (and therefore some of the discrepancy would be due to the Martian equivalent of the equation of time).
March 5, 2024: NASA released images of transits of the moon Deimos, the moon Phobos and the planet Mercury as viewed by the &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover on the planet Mars.


== Images of the shadow ==
Viewed from orbit, the penumbral shadow of Phobos can be seen to move rapidly over the Martian surface. This shadow on the Martian surface has been photographed on many occasions by Mars Global Surveyor.

=== &quot;Viking 1&quot; ===
In the 1970s, the &quot;Viking 1&quot; Lander and Orbiter photographed the shadow as well. The Lander detected the penumbral shadow of Phobos passing across it.
This was detected only as a slight dimming of the ambient light; the &quot;Viking 1&quot; Lander camera did not image the Sun. The shadow took about 20 seconds to pass over the Lander, moving at about 2 km/s. The shadow was simultaneously imaged from the &quot;Viking 1&quot; Orbiter, which permitted locating the position of the lander in the orbiter pictures.

=== 26 August 1999 image ===

Far more detailed images of the shadow were taken with the arrival in 1997 of the Mars Global Surveyor and its high-resolution Mars Orbital Camera. One such image was taken on 26 August 1999 and shows the shadow at high resolution. This image was featured in a 1 November 1999 NASA press release.

By examining maps of Mars
we see the shadow is centered at around 10.9°N 49.2°W.

We can also look up the original image files at M04-03241 (red) and M04-03242 (blue), part of the gallery of MOC Wide-Angle Images, Region Lunae Palus, Subphase M04. The &quot;image start time&quot; was 03:26:13.01 UTC, the &quot;line integration time&quot; is 80.4800 milliseconds, and the &quot;downtrack summing&quot; factor is 4. Since the shadow is centered at 6400 pixels from the bottom of the original 10800-pixel-high image (Mars Global Surveyor had a south-to-north Sun-synchronous orbit), we add (6400 × 0.08048 × 4) = 2060.3 seconds = 34 minutes 20.3 seconds to get a time of 04:00:33.3 UTC for the center of the shadow.

Putting in the longitude/latitude/altitude coordinate values -310.8,10.9,0 into
JPL Horizons we see that the predicted time of mid-transit was 04:00:36 UTC, in perfect agreement within the error of determining the exact longitude and latitude of the center of the shadow. This was about 14:41 Martian local solar time, and the Sun&#x27;s altitude was 46.5° above the horizon. JPL Horizons also shows that on 26 August 1999 the distance between the Earth and Mars was 9.6 light-minutes.

=== Other images ===

Many dozens of other images of the shadow exist, but these are much lower resolution (by a factor of 27/4). Three such images are shown in the 1 November 1999 NASA press release.

The timestamps printed on the photos in the NASA press release do not correspond to the actual time that the shadow was imaged, rather they represent the &quot;image start time&quot; of a vertically much larger original image. Mars Global Surveyor orbits Mars in a Sun-synchronous polar orbit with orbital period 117.65 minutes, moving from south pole to north pole, and continuously points its camera straight down. The result is an image in the form of a very long thin vertical strip, where the pixels in the top part of the image are imaged nearly one hour after those in the bottom part of the image. In principle the image could be as much as 43200 pixels high, but &quot;downtrack summing&quot; is used to merge adjacent lines. For instance, a downtrack summing factor of 27 causes every 27 lines to be merged into one, resulting in an image 1600 pixels high. Thus to determine the actual time that the Phobos shadow was imaged, it is necessary to locate the original image and measure how many pixels from the bottom of the image the shadow is found and add the corresponding offset to the image start time.

For example, we examine the image labeled with the timestamp 1 September 1999 20:13:05 (UTC). We have the original images M07-00166 (red) and M07-00167 (blue), part of the gallery of MOC Global-Map Images, Subphase M07. The shadow is situated at roughly 14°N 236°W.

In this case the image start time is 20:13:04.69 UTC, the line integration time is 80.48 milliseconds, and the downtrack summing factor is 27. The shadow is about 8 pixels high, centered at 993 pixels from the bottom of the original 1600-pixel-high image. We add (993 × 0.08048 × 27) = 2157.75 seconds = 35 minutes 57.75 seconds to get a time of 20:49:02.4 UTC for the center of the shadow.

Putting in the longitude/latitude/altitude coordinate values -124,14,0 into JPL Horizons gives an expected time of 20:49 for the transit, which is in good agreement once again. On 1 September 1999 the distance between the Earth and Mars was 9.9 light-minutes.

== Other observations ==
Transits of Phobos in 2019 were detected as a transient drop in the solar array current data of the InSight lander.
 At the time, the data were only acquired at 30s intervals, and so the events were only recorded as single-sample dips of a few to a few tens of per cent.

During the transits of spring 2020, all instruments onboard InSight recorded with full sampling rate and a slight tilt of the ultra-sensitive seismometer was observed, as well as a drop in solar irradiation and a 2 K drop in surface temperature. The tilt of the seismometer was caused from contraction of the ground due to the temperature drop; everywhere but in the shadow the thermal shielding around the seismometer.

<doc id="739801" wikidata="Q5189781" url="?curid=739801" title="Crucial Three">
<text>The Crucial Three were a short-lived band that existed for approximately six weeks in early 1977. They are nevertheless notable on account of the individual success of all three founding members: Julian Cope formed The Teardrop Explodes and has enjoyed a long and successful solo career as an author, photographer and singer, Ian McCulloch formed the very successful Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, while guitarist Pete Wylie formed Wah! Heat (and various subsequent incarnations of Wah!) and enjoyed major chart success with &quot;The Story of the Blues&quot;. In those early days, McCulloch sang, Cope played bass, and Wylie played guitar. A drummer, Stephen Spence, also joined at some point in their brief life.

==The band==
The band formed in May 1977 and split in June 1977.

According to Cope, the three friends first talked about forming a band on McCulloch&#x27;s 18th birthday, 5 May 1977, during the Clash&#x27;s White Riot tour date at Eric&#x27;s; &quot;By the end of the evening, we were a group. It was all Wylie&#x27;s trip. He suggested Arthur Hostile &amp; the Crucial Three. Duke [McCulloch] said, &#x27;Sod the bloody Arthur Hostile bit off, it&#x27;s crap.&#x27; So we were the Crucial Three. Wylie went on about how legendary we would be, and Duke and I went along with him, as part of the in-joke.&quot;

Although they wrote and rehearsed a number of songs (Wylie claims they had four songs), including &quot;Salomine Shuffle&quot; (which was performed by Wylie in an abbreviated form at The Zanzibar in Liverpool in September 2007) and &quot;Bloody Sure You&#x27;re on Dope&quot;, the band did not last long enough to record anything. They rehearsed in a garage with drummer Steve Spence and split up after a month. According to McCulloch, the band were &quot;...just mates - we never did anything. We wrote one crap song.&quot;

==After the band==
Some of the band&#x27;s songs have seen the light of day posthumously, most notably the Cope/McCulloch collaboration &quot;Books&quot;, which appeared on both the Teardrop Explodes&#x27; and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s respective first albums (the Bunnymen version is titled &quot;Read It in Books&quot; and only appeared on the US release). &quot;Robert Mitchum&quot;, another Cope/McCulloch collaboration, appeared on Cope&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Skellington&quot;. The song &quot;Spacehopper&quot; from Cope&#x27;s solo album &quot;Saint Julian&quot; was also written during his time in the band, allegedly with some help from McCulloch.

After the Crucial Three, Julian Cope and Pete Wylie formed the Nova Mob, a conceptual band named after a gang mentioned in William Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;Nova Express&quot;. Recruiting punk friend Pete Griffiths and future Siouxsie and the Banshees drummer Budgie, the Nova Mob were goaded into headlining at Liverpool&#x27;s top punk club, Eric&#x27;s. The show was a disaster according to observers and Budgie left to join Big in Japan, at which point the band split up. Julian Cope briefly formed an experimental group called The Hungry Types, and then formed Uh? with Ian McCulloch and McCulloch&#x27;s school friend Dave Pickett. McCulloch left after the band&#x27;s first and only gig. Cope and McCulloch formed their last band A Shallow Madness in early 1978, along with organist Paul Simpson and Dave Pickett, now on drums. A rehearsal recording of &quot;Books&quot; as performed by A Shallow Madness appears on the 2004 the Teardrop Explodes rarities collection &quot;Zoology&quot;.

A Shallow Madness featured the original Teardrop Explodes line-up of Julian Cope, Paul Simpson, Dave Pickett and Mick Finkler, plus Ian McCulloch. The latter&#x27;s non-attendance at rehearsals led to Cope taking over vocals and thus the Teardrop Explodes was born. The Teardrop Explodes&#x27;s 1981 album, &quot;Wilder&quot;, features the song &quot;The Culture Bunker&quot;, which references Cope&#x27;s former band with the lines &quot;...waiting for the Crucial Three...wondering what went wrong.&quot; 

The well publicized animosity between Cope and McCulloch finally reached a boiling point when Cope fired McCulloch&#x27;s friend Mick Finkler from the Teardrop Explodes. Further animosity was stoked when &quot;Passionate Friend&quot; by Teardrop Explodes was released, a reference to Julian Cope&#x27;s former girlfriend, Ian McCulloch&#x27;s sister. 

Drummer Steve Spence pursued a career in advertising, and now works as a Creative Director in London.

==References in popular culture==
Pavement dedicated a song to the Crucial Three in their live performance from Brixton Academy, London on 14 December 1992, featured on &quot;Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe &amp; Reduxe&quot;. The dedication is at the end of track 14 - &quot;Home&quot;, on the album, but it sounds as though the dedication is in reference to the next song, &quot;Perfume-V&quot;.

The Ed Ball project the Times mentioned the Crucial Three&#x27;s name in the lyrics of &quot;A Girl Called Mersey&quot;, a tribute to the Liverpool&#x27;s scene, co-written with his guitarist Richard Green.

The memory of the Crucial Three was revived in 2004 by BBC Radio 2 DJ Mark Radcliffe whose show featured a nightly quiz of the same name, until it ended on 5 April 2007. The quiz was introduced on alternate evenings with recorded announcements by McCulloch and Cope.

The title of Dag Nasty&#x27;s song &quot;Crucial Three&quot; off of 1987&#x27;s &quot;Wig Out at Denko&#x27;s&quot; is a reference to the band of the same name, though the lyrics focus entirely Cortner&#x27;s personal relationship struggles in adolescence.

<text>The Campbell Playhouse (1938–1940) was a live CBS radio drama series directed by and starring Orson Welles. Produced by Welles and John Houseman, it was a sponsored continuation of &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;. The series offered hour-long adaptations of classic plays and novels, as well as adaptations of popular motion pictures.

When Welles left at the end of the second season, &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; changed format as a 30-minute weekly series that ran for one season (1940–41).

==Production==

As a direct result of the front-page headlines Orson Welles generated with his 1938 Halloween production &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, Campbell&#x27;s Soup signed on as sponsor. &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; made its last broadcast December 4, 1938, and &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; began December 9, 1938.

The series made its debut with Welles&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Rebecca&quot;, with guest stars Margaret Sullavan and Mildred Natwick. The radio drama was the first adaptation of the 1938 novel by Daphne Du Maurier; the author was interviewed live from London at the conclusion of the broadcast.

Bernard Herrmann had time to compose a complete score for &quot;Rebecca&quot;. &quot;It was absolutely beautiful,&quot; said associate producer Paul Stewart, &quot;and it was the first time to me that Benny was something more than a guy who could write bridges.&quot; Herrmann later used the main theme as the basis of his score for the film &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

Although the same creative staff stayed on, the show had a different flavor under sponsorship. This was partially due to a guest star policy which relegated the Mercury Players to supporting roles. There was a growing schism between Welles, still reaping the rewards of his Halloween eve notoriety, and Houseman, who became an employee rather than a partner. Houseman worked primarily as supervising editor on the radio shows.

Howard E. Koch remained on the writing staff through &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (March 10, 1939), when he left for Hollywood. He was succeeded by Howard Teichmann, who wrote for the show for two years.

After signing a film contract with RKO in August 1939, Welles began commuting from Hollywood to New York for the two Sunday broadcasts of &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. In November 1939, production of the show moved from New York to Los Angeles.

Screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz was put on the Mercury payroll and wrote five scripts for &quot;Campbell Playhouse&quot; shows broadcast between November 12, 1939, and March 17, 1940. Mankiewicz proved to be useful, particularly working with Houseman as editor. The episode &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; includes an inside joke: the Viennese doctor asked to certify Deeds insane is named Dr. Herman Mankiewicz.

After an argument over finances December 16, 1939, John Houseman resigned from the Mercury Theatre and returned to New York. Two months later Welles hired him back to work with Mankiewicz on a new venture, Welles&#x27;s first film project, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

After 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control over &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;, and had complete control over story selection. Diana Bourbon, an account executive from the Ward Wheelock agency, was appointed as liaison between Welles and Campbell. Bourbon acted as de facto producer, and she and Welles frequently clashed over story and casting. One notable dispute came after the broadcast of &quot;Algiers&quot;, which employed a carefully crafted tapestry of sound to create the world of the Casbah. Challenged on why the background sounds were so loud, Welles responded, &quot;Who told you it was the background?&quot;

Amiable classics were chosen over many of Welles&#x27;s story suggestions, including &quot;Of Human Hearts&quot;; the rights to many works, including &quot;Rogue Male&quot;, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, could not be obtained. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles determined not to sign on for another season. &quot;I&#x27;m sick of having the heart torn out of a script by radio censorship,&quot; he said. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940—a reprise of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, after Welles&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;Alice Adams&quot; was not accepted—Welles and Campbell parted amicably.
&quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; returned to radio November 29, 1940, as a 30-minute weekly CBS series that was last broadcast June 13, 1941. The program was produced by Diana Bourbon. The series&#x27; focus shifted away from classic play and novel adaptations to lighter, more popular fare, still with casts drawn from the ranks of film actors.

<text>Philip Gerald Givens, (April 24, 1922 – November 30, 1995) was a Canadian politician and judge. He was the Mayor of Toronto, a Member of Parliament (MP) and Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP). He was born and raised in Toronto and attended high school at Harbord Collegiate Institute. He studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School and graduated in 1949. He became a judge after leaving politics in the late 1970s. He retired from the judiciary in 1988, and died in Toronto in 1995.

==Life and career==
Givens was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Mary and Hyman Gewirtz, and was Jewish. A Liberal, Givens was a longtime member of Toronto&#x27;s city council. As the senior controller on the city&#x27;s Board of Control, he was appointed Toronto&#x27;s acting mayor upon the sudden death of the incumbent, Donald Summerville, on November 19, 1963. He served the remaining 13 months in Summerville&#x27;s two-year term, and then was elected as mayor in the 1964 municipal election.

He led a public campaign to purchase a sculpture by artist Henry Moore, &quot;The Archer&quot;, for placement in Toronto&#x27;s Nathan Phillips Square in front of the City Hall. Although vigorously opposed at the time by traditionalists, Givens got his way and the sculpture has become a beloved piece of public art. The controversy had a political cost, however, and Givens was defeated when he ran for re-election as mayor in 1966.

Toward the end of his term in office, he appeared in the feature film &quot;The Offering&quot; as himself.

Givens ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1957 and 1958 federal elections, but was defeated in his bid to become Member of Parliament for Spadina. He was finally elected to Parliament in the 1968 election from the York West electoral district in suburban Toronto. In 1971 he resigned from the House of Commons before his term was completed. He then ran in the 1971 Ontario provincial election for the Ontario Liberal Party in the Ontario Legislative Assembly&#x27;s York-Forest Hill constituency. He won the close three-way race by promising to support the completion of the Spadina Expressway (Allen Road) on the constituency&#x27;s western border. His constituency was abolished in the 1975 electoral district boundary redistribution. In the 1975 provincial election he was elected again as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in the Armourdale constituency. He defeated future Toronto mayor (and then-Mayor of North York) Mel Lastman. After retiring from politics in 1977, Givens was given a judicial appointment and was made chairman of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Commission.

==Legacy==

The city of Toronto renamed Caribou Park as Phil Givens Park in 2016.

<doc id="739812" wikidata="Q7762808" url="?curid=739812" title="The Seahorses">
<text>The Seahorses were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1996 by guitarist John Squire, following his departure from The Stone Roses.

The band released their debut album &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; in 1997, and began work on a follow-up before splitting up due to musical differences, during recording sessions in January 1999.

Commenting on the band in 2002, Squire stated that he had &quot;rushed into that one. The Seahorses was more a rash reaction to leaving the Roses than a considered option&quot;, and that &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the kind of artist who can cope in a proper band democracy. I require too much control. I hate having my ideas refracted through someone else. I&#x27;ve tried in the past to be accommodating and make the band a complete outfit, but only to have it thrown back in my face. I&#x27;m loath to ever do that again&quot;.

==Formation and initial media interest==
Squire formed the Seahorses in 1996 following his departure from the Stone Roses. He first recruited bassist Stuart Fletcher, who he saw by chance at the Fibbers venue in York where he was drinking with his guitar tech Martin Herbet. Fletcher was playing in local covers band, The Blueflies, as a last-minute replacement for the band&#x27;s regular bass player who had pulled out of the gig. Squire then auditioned two singers – Sean O&#x27;Brien, previously of Warrington band the Steamboat Band, and Chris Helme, who was spotted by a friend of Squire&#x27;s guitar tech busking outside Woolworths in York. Following several auditions and the prompting of his manager, Squire eventually settled on Helme, despite being hesitant because he &quot;closed his eyes when he sang and only folk singers do that&quot;. While Helme was a songwriter too, Squire admitted early on that despite liking a couple of Helme&#x27;s songs – including &quot;Blinded by the Sun&quot;, which he re-arranged for the album – &quot;Yeah, he can write the odd tune but I don&#x27;t really like them and it might be a problem later on if he wants to record them with the band&quot;.

In the summer of 1996, Squire rented a cottage in Coniston, Cumbria to write and rehearse with Helme and Fletcher. Several drummers were auditioned before finally recruiting Andy Watts, who had previously gigged with Fletcher and also knew Helme.

Due to Squire&#x27;s past work with the Stone Roses, the band were met with intense media interest and speculation before they had recorded or released anything. It had been rumoured that former bandmate Reni was set to join the band. It was then rumoured that a delay in recruiting a drummer was due to Squire&#x27;s desire to get a drummer who, like Reni, could also sing backing vocals. However, in 2019 bassist Stuart Fletcher revealed that they had actually been working with a drummer called Mark McNeill who had to be dismissed from the band following several failed rehab visits as &quot;he couldn’t remember anything we rehearsed&quot;. The band name was also the subject of various conspiracy theories after the &quot;NME&quot; claimed that it was an anagram of &quot;He Hates Roses&quot;. Other alleged anagrams included &quot;The Rose Ashes&quot; and by dropping the definite article, &quot;She&#x27;s A Rose&quot;. Squire responded &quot;That&#x27;s pure coincidence. I chose the name because at the time, I kept seeing them everywhere and because some people think they don&#x27;t exist. They are unusual because it is the male of the species who gets pregnant.&quot; Squire then changed the band&#x27;s name from &quot;The Seahorses&quot; to simply &quot;Seahorses&quot;, but this was short lived after it turned out that another band had been using the name for several years.

== &quot;Do it Yourself&quot; ==
Just weeks after Watts joined, the band played secret warm-up gigs in Buckley, Greenock and Lancaster, before heading to North Hollywood to record with David Bowie and T. Rex producer Tony Visconti. The band released their debut single &quot;Love Is the Law&quot; on 28 April 1997 via Geffen Records, to whom Squire was still signed following his departure from the Stone Roses. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;, was released in May 1997. One of the songs on the album, &quot;Love Me and Leave Me&quot;, was co-written with Liam Gallagher of Oasis, with whom the band toured in 1997.

Shortly before the release of the single &quot;Love Me and Leave Me&quot;, it was announced that drummer Andy Watts was leaving the group to spend more time with his family. Watts later claimed that he was actually asked to leave by the band&#x27;s manager Steve Atherton at a meeting with the band&#x27;s accountants, on behalf of the band, because they did not approve of the drummer&#x27;s excessive behaviour on tour, and felt he did not fit in with the desired image for the band. Commenting on the reason for Watts&#x27;s departure, Helme stated that he had been &quot;playing like an arse&quot;; Watts later put that down to his cocaine usage. Fletcher would later reveal that Watts had &quot;gone off the rails&quot;. Watts was temporarily replaced by session players Mal Scott (who toured with the band throughout 1997 and played on the standalone Squire/Helme co-written single &quot;You Can Talk to Me&quot; in December 1997) and Toby Drummond.

The band went on to play support slots with The Rolling Stones, U2, and Oasis. In 1998, the band began work on a follow-up album with another new drummer, Mark Heaney. They previewed several new songs during secret fan club gigs and festival appearances, including &quot;City in the Sky&quot;, &quot;700 Horses&quot;, &quot;Tombraid&quot; and two Helme compositions &quot;Won&#x27;t Let You Fall&quot; and &quot;Moth&quot;.

== Second album recording sessions and split ==
The band entered Olympic Studios with producer David Bottrill in January 1999 to record the album, with the working titles of &quot;Minus Blue&quot; and &quot;Motocade&quot;, and tensions came to a head between Squire and Helme. Fletcher later revealed that he witnessed Helme &quot;turn a Larrivée guitar into match sticks during that session&quot;. Squire walked out of the studio and didn&#x27;t return; the sessions were abandoned, and the group split up.

The band&#x27;s split was officially announced on 23 January 1999, with a press release citing musical differences. A spokesman for the band later informed the &quot;NME&quot; that Squire had &quot;become increasingly dissatisfied with the material being produced by Helme until it reached a point where their partnership was no longer possible&quot;.

Despite having previewed fully formed songs including two of his own compositions, Helme would later claim in 2001 that his contributions were being ignored and that the songs the band were working on were &quot;unfinished tunes with unfinished lyrics, and they&#x27;re all John&#x27;s songs&quot;. Squire had previously commented that &quot;I&#x27;d say the ratio of songwriting is the same as before; Chris and I help each other out with songs, but we haven&#x27;t done that many strict collaborations&quot;, and sources close to the band confirmed that the band had worked on a number of his songs that were set to appear on the album.

Helme admitted in 2011 that he had been unhappy with Squire writing the majority of the band&#x27;s material and, therefore, picking up the majority of the band&#x27;s publishing money. Due to this, he attempted to launch a solo career whilst still in the Seahorses, and claimed that the Seahorses&#x27; management informed him that they would sue him if he started touring playing his own material whilst still a member of the band. This led to trust issues between Helme and Squire, and Helme began drinking heavily and turning up for rehearsals &quot;hung over and stinking&quot; to the increasing irritation of Squire.

Squire later commented on his reasons for ending the band that &quot;I thought &#x27;This sounds shit, we don&#x27;t deserve to be in this place.&#x27; The band sounded complacent. I don&#x27;t suppose it was anyone&#x27;s fault. Maybe it got far too much attention for very little effort in the early stages, because of what I&#x27;d done in the past.&quot; He also added that the &quot;band wasn&#x27;t working out cos the singer, Chris, wanted to pursue a solo career in tandem, there was no way that that was going to work for me&quot;.

==Post-breakup==
Following the demise of the Seahorses, Squire continued work with drummer Mark Heaney on a new project called John Squire&#x27;s Skunkworks which also featured vocalist Duncan Baxter plus ex-Verve members Simon Jones and Simon Tong. However, the project collapsed and the other band members continued and released material as The Shining. He later released two solo albums and toured both, before announcing he was quitting music to concentrate on his art. Squire later recanted and rejoined The Stone Roses in 2011.

Following the split of The Shining, Heaney carried on working as a drum teacher and session musician, appearing on Squire&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Time Changes Everything&quot;. He joined post-punk icons Gang of Four in 2005, and continued working as a session drummer for artists such as Badly Drawn Boy and Klaxons. and many others.

Helme pursued a solo career and went on to attack John Squire in the press, describing his material as &quot;muso wank&quot;. He then formed The Yards with Stuart Fletcher and former Shed Seven guitarist Paul Banks in 2001, who released two albums on their own Industrial Erotica label before splitting in November 2009 and has since resurrected his solo career with the self-released album &quot;Ashes&quot;. He later commented on his relationship with Squire that &quot;I don&#x27;t have any contact with him now, I didn&#x27;t really when I was in the band – he was quite elusive.

Fletcher is still active in the local York music scene. He regularly performs in covers band The Mothers, and also played with Rick Witter in his short-lived post-Shed Seven band Rick Witter &amp; The Dukes. He joined Heather Findlays band, Mantra Vega, in 2015, and joined to Hurricane #1 in 2018.

The band&#x27;s first drummer, Andy Watts, went on to front the short-lived Mozer, who split prior to releasing anything. In 2004 he began performing sporadic solo acoustic shows around London. Since then, he&#x27;s worked with the likes of Stuart A Staples (Tindersticks) and Roger Goslyn. Watts was also commissioned to write for a BBC radio documentary celebrating 30 years of the song &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Rhapsody in Bohemia won Best Documentary: Directors&#x27; Choice Award in the 2006 Third Coast awards. He released a solo EP, &quot;Fragments of Bone&quot;, on his own imprint, Meraki Records, in 2014. In 2016, he and his partner released their debut children&#x27;s book &quot;Cloud Cuckoo Land&quot; under the moniker &#x27;Wavey n Snotts&#x27;, leading to a tour of Waterstones book stores and invites to several literary and music festivals.

<text>Shavit 2 (Hebrew: &quot;comet&quot; – שביט) is a small lift launch vehicle produced by Israel from 1982 onwards, to launch satellites into low Earth orbit. It was first launched on 19 September 1988 (carrying an Ofek-1 satellite payload), making Israel the eighth nation to have an orbital launch capability after the USSR, United States, France, Japan, People&#x27;s Republic of China, United Kingdom, and India.

The Shavit 2 project is believed to have been an offshoot development, resulting from Israel&#x27;s Jericho nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program.

Shavit rockets are launched from Palmachim Airbase by the Israel Space Agency into highly retrograde orbits over the Mediterranean Sea to prevent debris coming down in populated areas and also to avoid flying over nations hostile to Israel to the east; this results in a lower payload-to-orbit than east-directed launches would allow. The launcher consists of three stages powered by solid-fuel rocket motors, with an optional liquid-fuel fourth stage, and is manufactured by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI).

The Republic of South Africa produced and tested a licensed version in cooperation with Israel called the RSA-3 in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to produce a domestic satellite launch vehicle and ballistic missile; the South African program was closed in 1994.

An earlier unrelated project called Shavit 2 was the first Israeli sounding rocket, launched on 5 July 1961 for meteorological research. Shavit Three, with an altitude reported as , was launched on 11 August 1961.

== Development ==
The development of Shavit 2 began in 1982. Shavit was a three-stage, solid-propellant launcher designed to carry payloads up to 250 kg into low Earth orbit. It was speculated for some time and later confirmed that the first two stages of the Shavit were that of the Jericho II missile.

Shavit was first launched in 1988 and because of its geographic location and hostile relations with surrounding countries, Israel had to launch it to the west, over the Mediterranean Sea, in order to avoid flying over those hostile territories to its east. The practice has continued ever since.

== Vehicle description ==
The first of the Shavit vehicles were a small, 3-stage, solid-propellant booster based on the 2-stage Jericho-II ballistic missile and developed under the general management of Israel Aircraft Industries and in particular its MBT System and Space Technology subsidiary. Israel Military Industries Systems produces the first-stage and second-stage motors, while Rafael is responsible for the third-stage motor.

A planned commercial Shavit upgrade was called Next. This name is no longer used, and this proposed upgrade configuration is now called Shavit-2. Both first and second stages of the Shavit-2 use the stretched motor design of the Shavit-1 first stage.

== Launch history ==
The Shavit has been launched 12 times, placing the payload into orbit 10 times. On the 4th and 6th flights, the vehicle failed before reaching space. Most non-Israeli satellites are launched eastward to gain a boost from the Earth&#x27;s rotational speed. However, the Shavit is launched westward (retrograde orbit) over the Mediterranean Sea to avoid flying and dropping spent rocket stages over populated areas in Israel and neighboring Arab countries. The Shavit is also said to be made available for commercial launches in the near future.

The September 2004 failure of the Shavit resulted in the destruction of the US$100 million Ofeq 6 spy satellite. Israel used Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in the subsequent launch for the TecSAR SAR satellite, while upgrading the Shavit launcher. On the upgraded Shavit 2, the follow-up Ofeq 7 was successfully launched on a Shavit rocket in 2007.

== South African RSA series ==
The Jericho II missile-Shavit SLV was also license produced in the Republic of South Africa as the RSA series of space launch vehicles and ballistic missiles. The RSA-3 was produced by the Houwteq (a discontinued division of Denel) company at Grabouw, 30 km east of Cape Town. Test launches were made from Overberg Test Range near Bredasdorp, 200 km east of Cape Town. Rooiels was where the engine-test facilities were located. Development continued even after South African renunciation of its nuclear weapons for use as a commercial satellite launcher. Development actually reached its height in 1992, a year after nuclear renunciation, with 50–70 companies involved, employing 1300–1500 people from the public and private sector. A much heavier ICBM or space launch vehicle, the RSA-4, with a first stage in the Peacekeeper ICBM class but with Jericho-2/RSA-3 upper-stage components was in development.
In June 1994 the RSA-3 / RSA-4 South African satellite launcher program was cancelled.

== Proposed LK civilian launch variants ==
In 1998, Israel Space Agency partnered with U.S. Coleman Research Corporation (now a division of L-3 Communications) to develop the LK family of small launch vehicles. In 2001, a new French joint-venture, LeoLink, between Astrium and Israel Aircraft Industries, was created to market the LK variant. It is believed that in 2002 development of the LK variant was discontinued.

The LK-1 was closely based on the Shavit-2, but with motors and other components built in the United States to satisfy U.S. government requirements. The LK-2 was a larger vehicle using a Thiokol Castor 120 motor as its first stage. The third stage was either a standard AUS-51 motor built under license by Atlantic Research Corp., or a Thiokol Star 48 motor. All launch vehicles would have had a small monopropellant hydrazine fourth stage.
* LK-A – for 350 kg-class satellites in 240 × 600 km elliptical polar orbits.
* LK-1 – for 350 kg-class satellites in 700 km circular polar orbits.
* LK-2 – for 800 kg-class satellites in 700 km circular polar orbits.

A Shavit LK air-launched satellite launcher was proposed by ISA and Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI). The booster would have been a standard Shavit-1 or Shavit-2 without a first stage that would be dropped from a Hercules C-130. An alternative proposal consisted of a full launch stack carried atop Boeing 747 aircraft, similar to how the Space Shuttle was carried, through the Straits of Tiran and past the Arabian Peninsula into open sea; this called for a zoom-climb launch over the Indian Ocean, permitting the eastward boost from the rotation of the Earth rather than launching into a westward retrograde orbit over the Mediterranean, nearly doubling the maximum payload weight.

<doc id="739815" wikidata="Q1162282" url="?curid=739815" title="Post office box">
<text>A post office box (commonly abbreviated as P.O. box, or also known as a postal box) is a uniquely addressable lockable box located on the premises of a post office.

In some regions, particularly in Africa, there is no door-to-door delivery of mail; for example, in Kenya. Consequently, renting a PO box has traditionally been the only way to receive mail in such countries.

Generally, post office boxes are rented from the post office either by individuals or by businesses on a basis ranging from monthly to annual, and the cost of rent varies depending on the box size. Central business district (CBD) PO boxes are usually more expensive than rural PO boxes.

In the United States, the rental rate used to be uniform across the country. Now, however, a postal facility can be in any of seven fee groups by location; in addition, certain customers qualify for free box rental, usually because the Postal Service does not offer carrier-route delivery to their physical addresses.

In the United Kingdom, Royal Mail PO boxes are often little more than pigeon-holes in the secure section of a sorting office and are accessible only by staff. In such cases, the renter of the PO box will be issued with a card showing the PO box number and delivery office name and must produce this to the desk staff when collecting mail. For an additional fee, the Royal Mail will deliver received items to the renter&#x27;s geographical address.

Some private companies (e.g., United Parcel Service and commercial mail receiving agencies) offer similar services of renting a mailbox in a public location. The difference is that mail sent there is addressed to a street address (along with the private box number), instead of just addressed to &quot;PO Box CSX&quot;. Virtual mailboxes are similar to P.O. boxes but usually provide additional services such as scanning or forwarding.

==Mounting of boxes==
Post office boxes are usually mounted in a wall of the post office, either an external wall or a wall in a lobby, so that staff on the inside may deposit mail in a box, while a key holder (some older post office boxes use a combination dial instead of a key) in the lobby or on the outside of the building may open their box to retrieve the mail.

=== Lobby open hours ===
In many post offices in the United States, the PO box lobby is separate from the window-service lobby, so that the former may be kept open for longer hours or around the clock, while the latter is locked after business hours. In the U.S. since the 1980s, in cities and large urban areas, post offices have tended to close box lobbies overnight because of the tendency of homeless people to use them for sleeping quarters. As a result, some box lobbies are accessible after hours by customers who are provided a code to a door keypad. In addition, some post offices are located in rented facilities, such as shopping malls. As a result, PO boxes can be accessed only while that facility is open.

== Packages ==
If a parcel does not fit in a PO box, the postmaster will leave a note advising that customer to pick up that parcel from the counter. In some post offices, a key will be left in the PO box that corresponds to a larger, locked box (parcel locker) where the patron may pick up their package if a signature is not required. Most often, in this case, once the key is used to open the larger, locked box, the key cannot be removed again by the patron, but the door cannot be secured either. Notes will also be left in the PO box in respect of cash on delivery (COD) and registered mail that has to be signed for.

In 2011, the United States Postal Service (USPS) began a pilot program with a computerized parcel locker kiosk system, called &quot;gopost&quot; which installed larger boxes to handle package pickup from an unstaffed station. A given box can be used by multiple customers thanks to the integration of a computer which accepts a delivery code.

=== Package delivery by private carriers ===
Until 2012, package delivery to USPS post office boxes was not available from private carriers like UPS, FedEx and others. In early 2012, the USPS introduced a P.O. Box Street Address (PBSA) service that allows box-holders to combine the street address of the post office where their box is located with their post office box number into a street address format. A mailing industry publication called the new service &quot;a great service for people who already have a PO Box and don&#x27;t want their packages delivered to their home.&quot;

==Locked bags and caller service==
Users receiving very large quantities of mail can use &quot;locked bags&quot;, which are numbered like PO boxes. In the United States, this service is called caller service, and the assigned number is called a caller number, although mail is typically addressed to &quot;PO Box (caller number).&quot;

==Security==

Each country has its own rules and regulations as to how one can retrieve mail at a PO Box. Some countries, such as the United States or the United Kingdom, may require one or more forms of identification. Not all countries offer locked PO Boxes.

In the United States, two forms of identification are required when signing up for a PO Box; one of which must be a photo ID.

==By continent==

Many countries offer some type of PO Boxes for different uses. There are an increasing number of private companies that provide similar PO Box services to the official postal service privately under the guise of mail forwarding.

===Africa===
==== Cameroon ====
Cameroon uses the PO Boxes in Kumba, Yaoundé, Duoala, Bamenda, and other provinces.

==== Namibia ====
In Namibia, PO boxes are the only form of mail delivery to private individuals. Even small settlements feature a block of PO boxes for rent. In Windhoek, capital and the only large town, blocks of PO boxes are scattered all over the city and not necessarily located at post offices but at shopping malls, in pedestrian zones or on public places.

==== South Africa ====
The South African Post Office has Post Boxes available for rent. These are usually attached to or close to a post office. In urban areas with PO Boxes for rent there also may be home delivery of mail. In rural areas Post Boxes are often compulsory as no street deliveries take place. In the areas for which there is no street delivery, Post Boxes are not charged for. Boxes and Street delivery postal codes may be the same in an area, or may differ. Private Bags are available for recipients of large mail volumes.

===Asia===
==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, PO boxes are available in two different sizes. They are available in many post offices throughout the territory.

==== Japan ====
In Japan, PO boxes are available at most post office locations. There is no cost to rent a post office box as the box is provided to ease the effort in delivering postal items to regular customers. Therefore, renters must receive at least one postal item every day and are expected to visit and retrieve mail regularly (daily, in principle) from the box. The renter must also rent the box for six months or more. Boxes in the metropolitan areas are often full and a new user expects to wait for years or more.

==== Philippines ====
In the Philippines, PO boxes are available for rent in selected post offices. PO boxes, also known as lock boxes, are available in three sizes: small, medium and large.

==== South Korea ====
In South Korea, PO boxes are available in one size at selected post offices. There is no charge for renting PO box, but renter must fetch mail at least once in 30 days. Application is only available at post office with valid ID, seal for receiving registered mail, and key fee (usually around 10,000 won). Seoul CPO box room is the only PO box in Korea with fully automated mail retrieving system.

===Europe===
====Austria====
In Austria, PO Boxes come in one size, and four different versions
#Only Post addressed to the PO Box will be delivered to it,
#All mail addressed to the address of the customer and the PO Box will be delivered to the PO Box,
#Same as 1., but for businesses,
#Same as 2., but for businesses, – they are generally available at all post offices throughout the country.

Only mail from Austrian Post can be delivered to an Austrian Post PO Box, but there are also private companies offering the same services.

====Serbia====
In Serbia, anyone can apply for Post Office Box (in Serbian: Поштански фах) for very small yearly fee (currently, cost is two standard postal stamps). Application contains identification and address information of a user. User may choose what mail should be delivered to postal office Box and what should be delivered to the real address. If not specified otherwise, all mail goes to Post Office Box.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, anyone applying for a Royal Mail PO box must produce documentation to verify their home or business address. Post can be forwarded to the real address or collected by the addressee.

===North America===

In Canada and the United States, Postal Boxes are available in five different sizes (A, B, C, D, and E). They are generally available in all post offices throughout the country.

In the United States, PO Boxes are generally available through the United States Postal Service (USPS). They are usually arranged from the smallest boxes at the top to the largest boxes at the bottom. The two largest sizes may be configured as drawers. To rent a PO Box, two different forms of identification are required. At least one of them must be a valid photo ID. This also applies to others who wish to share the box with the original subscriber&#x27;s permission, and are of legal age. The post office will &quot;not&quot; forward mail from a PO Box until the box is closed, and then only to one address for all subscribers. As part of the agreement to rent a PO Box, if the PO Box is used for business, the Post Office will provide, upon request, the geographical (street) address of the business.

====Street Addressing====
Until 2012, only items mailed or shipped via USPS could be received at a USPS PO Box. However, a service called &quot;Street Addressing&quot; has begun to change this. Once a permission form is completed by the box holder, Street Addressing allows private shippers, such as United Parcel Service (UPS) or FedEx, to ship items to a modification of the actual street address of the Post Office where the PO Box is located. The Post Office accepts the item, and places it in the PO Box or, for larger items, handles them the same way they would a package sent via USPS. (Some have storage lockers.) Only certain Post Offices offer Street Addressing, and even for ones that do, it may not be available to all of its PO Box customers (e.g., boxes without a fee). Other restrictions also exist, including the same limitations on items that cannot otherwise be mailed by &quot;ground service&quot; though USPS. (Not to be confused with items that cannot be shipped by air.) In many cases, the package may require one additional business day for delivery, and the service was never intended for overnight delivery. Also, federal holidays not observed by the private shipper might cause a delay. If an item is shipped using Street Addressing in which the box holder did not properly sign up for, it will be returned to sender.

Street Addressing will have the same street address of the post office, plus a &quot;unit number&quot; that matches the P.O. Box number. As an example, in El Centro, California, the post office is located at 1598 Main Street. Therefore, for P.O. Box 9975 (fictitious), the Street Addressing would be: 1598 Main Street Unit 9975, El Centro, CA. Nationally, the first five digits of the ZIP Code &quot;may or may not&quot; be the same as the P.O. Box address, and the last four digits (Zip + 4) are virtually always different. Except for a few of the largest post offices in the U.S., the &#x27;Street Addressing&#x27; (not the P.O. Box address) nine digit Zip + 4 is the same for all boxes at a given location.

===Oceania===
==== Australia ====
In Australia, wall-mounted PO boxes come in five sizes: small, medium, large, jumbo and A4. The different sizes boxes can be mixed almost completely arbitrarily on the wall. There is also an option for locked private bag which comes in two different sizes as well: small and large.

PO boxes and private locked bags can be combined.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, customers have the option to select between two sizes of PO Boxes: small and large. There is also an option to hire a Private Bag similar to &quot;locked bags&quot; in other countries. The annual fee is paid annually in advance.

<doc id="739816" wikidata="Q737932" url="?curid=739816" title="Sāyaṇa">
<text>Sayana (IAST: Sāyaṇa, also called Sāyaṇācārya; died 1387) was a 14th-century Sanskrit Mimamsa scholar from the Vijayanagara Empire of peninsular India, near modern day Bellary, Karnataka. An influential commentator on the Vedas, he flourished under King Bukka Raya I and his successor Harihara II. More than a hundred works are attributed to him, among which are commentaries on nearly all parts of the Vedas. He also wrote on a number of subjects like medicine, morality, music and grammar.

== Early life ==
Sāyaṇācārya was born to Mayana (IAST: Māyaṇa) and Shrimati in a Brahmin family who lived in Hampi. He had an elder brother named Madhava (sometimes identified as Vidyaranya) and a younger brother named Bhoganatha (or Somanatha). The family belonged to the Bharadvaja gotra, and followed the Taittiriya Shakha (school) of the Krishna Yajurveda.

He was the pupil of Vishnu Sarvajna and of Shankarananda. Both Mādhavāchārya and Sāyaṇāchārya were said to have studied under Vidyatirtha of Sringeri, and held offices in the Vijayanagara Empire. Sāyaṇāchārya was a minister, and subsequently prime minister in Bukka Raya&#x27;s court, and wrote much of his commentary with his brother and other Brahmins during his ministership.

==Works==
Sāyaṇa was a Sanskrit-language writer and commentator, and more than a hundred works are attributed to him, among which are commentaries on nearly all parts of the Vedas. Some of these works were actually written by his pupils, and some were written in conjunction with his brother, Vidyāraṇya or Mādhavacārya.

His major work is his commentary on the Vedas, &quot;Vedartha Prakasha&quot;, literally &quot;the meaning of the Vedas made manifest&quot;, written at the request of King Bukka of the Vijayanagara empire &quot;to invest the young kingdom with the prestige it needed.&quot; He was probably aided by other scholars, using the interpretations of several authors. The core portion of the commentary was likely written by Sāyaṇāchārya himself, but it also includes contributions by his brother Mādhavāchārya, and additions by his students and later authors who wrote under Sāyaṇāchārya&#x27;s name. &quot;Sāyaṇa&quot; (or also &quot;&quot;) by convention refers to the collective authorship of the commentary as a whole without separating such layers.

Galewicz states that Sayana, a Mimamsa scholar, &quot;thinks of the Veda as something to be trained and mastered to be put into practical ritual use&quot;, noticing that &quot;it is not the meaning of the mantras that is most essential [...] but rather the perfect mastering of their sound form.&quot; According to Galewicz, Sayana saw the purpose (&quot;artha&quot;) of the Veda as the &quot;&quot;artha&quot; of carrying out sacrifice&quot;, giving precedence to the &quot;Yajurveda&quot;. For Sayana, whether the mantras had meaning depended on the context of their practical usage. This conception of the Veda, as a repertoire to be mastered and performed, takes precedence over the internal meaning or &quot;autonomous message of the hymns.&quot;

His commentary on the Rigveda was translated from Sanskrit to English by Max Müller (1823–1900). A new edition, prepared by the Vaidik Samshodhan Mandala (Vedic Research Institute) Pune, under the general editor V. K. Rajwade, was published in 1933 in four volumes.

He has also written many lesser manuals called &quot;Sudhanidhis&quot; dealing with &quot;Prayaschitta&quot; (expiation), &quot;Yajnatantra&quot; (ritual), &quot;Purushartha&quot; (aims of human endeavour), &quot;Subhashita&quot; (Collection of moral sayings), &quot;Ayurveda&quot; (Indian traditional medicine), &quot;Sangita Sara&quot; (The essence of music), &quot;Prayaschitra&quot;, &quot;Alankara&quot;, and &quot;Dhatuvrddhi&quot; (grammar).

==Influence==
According to Dalal, &quot;his work influenced all later scholars, including many European commentators and translators.&quot; Sayana&#x27;s commentary preserved traditional Indian understandings and explanations of the Rigveda, though it also contains mistakes and contradictions. While some 19th century Indologists were quite dismissive of Sayana&#x27;s commentary, others were more appreciative. His commentary was used as a reference-guide by Ralph T. H. Griffith (1826–1906), John Muir (1810–1882), H. H. Wilson (1786–1860) and other 19th century European Indologists. According to Wilson, Sayana&#x27;s interpretation was sometimes questionable, but had &quot;a knowledge of his text far beyond the pretension of any European scholar&quot;, reflecting the possession &quot;of all the interpretations which had been perpetuated by traditional teaching from the earliest times.&quot; Macdonell (1854–1930) was critical of Sayana&#x27;s commentary, noting that many difficult words were not properly understood by Sayana. While Rudolf Roth (1821–1895) aimed at reading the Vedas as &quot;lyrics&quot; without the &quot;theological&quot; background of the interpretations of Yaska and Sayana, Max Müller (1823–1900) published a translation of the Rigvedic Samhitas together with Sayana&#x27;s commentary. His contemporaries Pischel and Geldner were outspoken about the value of Sayana&#x27;s commentary:
Modern scholarship is ambivalent. According to Jan Gonda, the translations of the Rigveda published by Griffith and Wilson were &quot;defective&quot;, suffering from their reliance on Sayana. Ram Gopal notes that Sayana&#x27;s commentary contains irreconcilable contradictions and &quot;half-baked&quot; tentative interpretations which are not further investigated, but also states that Sayana&#x27;s commentary is the &quot;most exhaustive and comprehensive&quot; of all available commentaries, embodying &quot;the gist of a substantial portion of the Vedic interpretations of his predecessors.&quot; Swami Dayananda, the founder of the Arya Samaj, a Vedic revivalist organisation, did not give much significance to his Vedic commentaries.

<doc id="739817" wikidata="Q1967833" url="?curid=739817" title="DreamWeb">
<text>Dreamweb is an MS-DOS and Amiga point-and-click cyberpunk top-down adventure game released in 1994, developed by Creative Reality and published by Empire Interactive Entertainment. The game features mature themes and a dark plot filled with violence and brief full frontal nudity, a rarity for games at the time.

&quot;Dreamweb&quot; was re-released as freeware in October 2012.

==Overview==
The opening credits are reminiscent of Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. In addition to a similar typeface, the credits are displayed in white on black, with a loud metallic noise followed by a fade out, and the title appears in red on black. Much of the look and feel of the game is reminiscent of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, while also drawing influence from the cyberpunk genre.

&quot;Dreamweb&quot;&#x27;s musical score, composed by Matthew Seldon and Steve Boynton, is highly regarded, contributing to the atmosphere which made the game admired by many at the time; the DOS-only CD version had an extra audio track. The dark story also received praise. The original game included a booklet entitled &quot;Diary of a (Mad?) man&quot;, written by Stephen Marley, which has a far more layered and atmospheric &#x27;prequel&#x27; story than the one in the game itself. The diary also supplies more background info on main character Ryan (and served as a copy-protection method).

The game was criticized for its poor top-down view and overlooking many conventions commonly observed in adventure games; for instance, while the player can examine and pick up most objects on-screen, the majority of them serve no purpose other than to take up inventory space. The inability to control the course of conversations was also seen as a flaw.

Some puzzles, although logical, are simplistic - while in many adventure games of the time (even more adult adventures) the solution to bypassing an NPC generally involved giving them an object, &quot;Dreamweb&quot; puts an emphasis on gunplay and the killing of several characters, sometimes with gory results. It was also one of the first mainstream games to feature an uncensored sex scene, which was quite controversial at the time of release.

&quot;Dreamweb&quot; had two releases on the Amiga. The AGA version had 256 color graphics and an extra song over the standard version. A PC version was released, first on disk format. The Amiga version features a moody electronic soundtrack; the PC version is similar in style, although some of the compositions are different. The music is primarily short, looping, streaming sound files, with the PC version&#x27;s being more advanced, although they suffer from low-fi encoding. A CD version was also released for the PC, which included full voice acting.

==Story==
The protagonist and anti-hero is Ryan, a bartender in a futuristic dystopian city (implied to be in England, as evidenced by the use of British English terms such as &quot;lift&quot; and &quot;bonnet&quot;) who has been plagued by strange dreams of an entity known as the Dreamweb. In the dream that opens the game, Ryan is asked by the master monk of the Keepers to be the &quot;deliverer&quot; and kill the seven evils, who are united to break the Dreamweb and send mankind spiraling into chaos. &quot;In Diary of a (Mad?) man&quot;, however, which precedes the start of the game, it is strongly implied that Ryan is descending into psychosis and has fabricated the whole Dreamweb scenario in his mind.

After Ryan leaves his girlfriend Eden&#x27;s house for work, he learns that due to frequent lateness his boss has decided to fire him. After hearing Ryan&#x27;s explanation, however, he decides to give him a two-week, fully paid vacation to recover. On the bar&#x27;s TV, Ryan learns the name and location of the first evil: David Crane, a rock star who is housed in a hotel for a gig later that night. He visits his housebound friend Louis, who directs him to a place where a gun can be purchased. After doing so, he registers himself at the same hotel, and after managing to get himself up to the penthouse, killing two bodyguards in the process, he finds Crane in bed with a woman. The woman hides under the bed and, after Crane begs for mercy, Ryan kills him and is teleported to the Dreamweb where he learns of the second evil, a general. He returns home, and while checking the news (where he finds the report of Crane&#x27;s death), he learns General Sterling is the guest of a talk show being filmed at a TV station.

He leaves for the heavily guarded building, and finds a weak spot in the security. He shoots a guard, enters the building and gets access to the rafters of the studio. After replacing a burned-out fuse, he manoeuvres a huge box over Sterling&#x27;s head and drops it, thereby crushing the general to death, but also causing a ratings peak for the channel. Ryan is transported again to the Dreamweb, where he learns the third target is close to one of his friends, none other than Eden&#x27;s boss, Sartain. He collects information from Eden&#x27;s work gear while she is bathing, and leaves for the company headquarters.

Ryan destroys a security console to get access to the upper floors, but as soon as he enters, he is greeted by two guards and a fleeing Sartain. He kills both guards with the help of a gem obtained in the Dreamweb, and in reading the contents of a briefcase grasped by the charred remains of a guard&#x27;s arm, Ryan learns the identities of the remaining four members. He chases Sartain to the rooftop where Sartain tries to flee in a hover car, but Ryan opens fire on the vehicle, destroying it. After another trip to the Dreamweb, he arrives at the destroyed house of Julliet Chappel, another of the evils. Believing she died, Ryan picks up a half-burnt cartridge and returns home, where from reading its contents he discovers the location of her church.

Unable to get inside the church, he pursues Diane Underwood, who is in a heavily guarded beach house. Upon inspecting the surroundings of the house, Ryan finds the control box of the security system, and douses it in water, blowing up the turret which releases heavy bolts of energy inside the house. Entering by the huge hole in the wall, Ryan finds Underwood chopped in half, but still alive. After learning more about the &quot;Project 7&quot;, Ryan kills the suffering woman. Back in the Dreamweb, he learns the remaining two evil are growing more powerful with each successive death of the members.

Arriving at the church and making his way into its secret underground passages, he finds the deceased, deformed body of Father O&#x27; Rourke, which leaves only one living member: Dr. Beckett. Ryan finds him in the subway, linked to the church&#x27;s undergrounds. As Beckett tracks Ryan, he is run over by a train. Ryan returns to the Dreamweb, where he is thanked by the master monk, but also learns his fate. He returns to the real world for the last time, where he is shot dead by the police for his numerous crimes. Ryan&#x27;s last vision is of his soul entering the Dreamweb.

==Development==
The biggest influence for the game was the 1986 film &quot;Highlander&quot;. The developers applied the concept of seven deadly sins to the game in the form of Ryan&#x27;s victims. The ending to the booklet &quot;Diary of a (Mad?) man&quot; was intentionally left ambiguous. Dialog trees were never considered to be part of the game because David Dew did not particularly like the mechanic. In 1995, &quot;DreamWeb&quot; was refused classification in Australia, due to a rock star showing his penis in the game. Underpants were added to the rock star and the game was resubmitted in the same year for an M rating.

==Reception==

The game was reviewed in 1995 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #215 by Jay &amp; Dee in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Both reviewers gave the game 1½ out of 5 stars.

DreamWeb also received negative 2000s reviews from Austin Boosinger of &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; (1½ out of 5 stars), David Tanguay of Adventure Classic Gaming (2 out of 5 stars) and Rosemary Young of the now defunct Quandaryland website (1 out of 5 stars).

Positive reviews were given by Tapio Salminen of the Finnish video games magazine &quot;Pelit&quot; (91 out of 100), Jamie Davies of the now defunct NTSC-uk website (7 out of 10), the French gaming website JeuxVideo (15 out of 20) and the video games magazine Power Play (85% out of 100%). Will Groves reviewed the game for &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, and while praising the &quot;atmospheric gameworld&quot; he noted that the game felt &quot;irretrievably old fashioned&quot; concluding that while it was not a bad game it was a style of title that had been done many times before and offered nothing novel.

<text>D.A.R.Y.L. is a 1985 science fiction adventure film directed by Simon Wincer and written by David Ambrose, Allan Scott, and Jeffrey Ellis. It stars Mary Beth Hurt, Michael McKean, Kathryn Walker, Colleen Camp, Josef Sommer, and Barret Oliver. It follows a seemingly normal young boy who turns out to be a top secret, military-created robot with superhuman abilities.

The film was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on June 14, 1985, by Paramount Pictures, and in the United Kingdom on June 20, 1985, by Columbia Pictures through Columbia-EMI-Warner Distributors. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb. For his performance, Oliver won the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor.

== Plot ==
The film revolves around the character of Daryl, an acronym for &quot;Data-Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform.&quot; Daryl is an artificial intelligence experiment created by a government company called TASCOM. Physically resembling a ten-year-old boy, Daryl&#x27;s brain is actually a highly advanced microcomputer with extraordinary abilities, including exceptional reflexes, multitasking skills, and the ability to hack computer systems. The experiment was intended to produce a super-soldier and was funded by the military.

One of the scientists involved in the project, Dr. Mulligan, becomes disillusioned and decides to free Daryl. Pursued by a helicopter, Dr. Mulligan sacrifices himself to ensure Daryl&#x27;s escape, driving his car off a cliff. Daryl is subsequently discovered by an elderly couple and taken to an orphanage in Barkenton, South Carolina. However, he has no memory of his true identity. After being placed with his foster parents, Joyce and Andy Richardson, Daryl begins to exhibit exceptional talents.

Daryl&#x27;s social skills are limited due to his isolated upbringing, but he befriends Turtle, a sarcastic and wisecracking neighbor. Daryl shares that he has amnesia and hopes his real parents will find him someday. As Daryl observes Turtle playing a video game called &quot;Pole Position&quot;, he effortlessly outperforms him, displaying superhuman abilities. Andy decides to teach Daryl social skills through baseball, where Daryl excels, hitting multiple home runs and impressing everyone. Daryl also demonstrates his advanced capabilities when he helps Andy rectify an issue with an ATM and manipulates it to put more than one million dollars into his foster father&#x27;s account.

During a baseball game, government agents locate Daryl and return him to the TASCOM facility in Washington, D.C., where his memory is restored. Daryl undergoes debriefing, and it is revealed that his capacity for human emotions has deemed the project a failure, leading to a decision to terminate him. Dr. Stewart, one of Daryl&#x27;s creators, helps him escape, assisted by Dr. Lamb, who now questions Daryl&#x27;s true nature.

Daryl and Dr. Stewart evade their pursuers with Daryl&#x27;s driving skills. However, the next day, while trying to escape a roadblock, Dr. Stewart is shot and later dies from his injuries. That night, Daryl sneaks onto a military base and steals a jet. Daryl contacts Turtle, instructing him and Sherie to meet him at Blue Lake, a familiar location. The Air Force attempts to intercept the plane but fails. Daryl ejects at the last moment to fake his death while the plane is destroyed. However, he lands unconscious in the lake and drowns. Daryl&#x27;s body is rushed to the hospital but shows no signs of life.

Dr. Lamb discovers Daryl and reactivates his electronic brain, reviving him. With Daryl now declared dead, he is no longer pursued by TASCOM. He joyfully reunites with his foster family, bringing happiness to everyone, including Turtle, who believed Daryl could not die since he is a robot.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $7,840,873 in the United States and Canada.

===Critical response===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;The best that can be said about &quot;D.A.R.Y.L.&quot; is that it&#x27;s inoffensive&quot; and &quot;though &quot;D.A.R.Y.L.&quot; is not really bad, it&#x27;s pretty silly. It might be more profitably shelved and some of the earlier films of its actors re-released.&quot;

Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The script is moronic and so riddled with improbabilities that the suspense element never takes root. Director Simon Wincer has no sense of pace or rhythm, but boy does he love to shoot helicopters and jet fighters, which whizz at the camera in great booming arcs. Well, it is noisy.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, Leonard Maltin said, &quot;This is one of the blandest movies I&#x27;ve seen all year. No punch. No surprises. No juice, especially in the way it&#x27;s directed.&quot; On their show &quot;At the Movies&quot;, Gene Siskel gave &quot;D.A.R.Y.L.&quot; a &quot;thumbs down&quot; for being predictable and formulaic, while Roger Ebert recommended the movie, praising its ending and comparing its theme to that of the 1968 film &quot;Charly&quot;.

DVD Verdict cites &quot;wooden&quot; acting and a &quot;preposterous&quot; plot, but ultimately concludes that the film is &quot;a formulaic slice of family entertainment that doesn&#x27;t do much new, but follows the blueprint well enough to warrant a look.&quot;

<doc id="739823" wikidata="Q742790" url="?curid=739823" title="Client-to-client protocol">
<text>Client-to-client protocol (CTCP) is a special type of communication between Internet Relay Chat (IRC) clients.

CTCP is a common protocol implemented by most major IRC clients in use today. CTCP extends the original IRC protocol by allowing users to query other clients or channels, this causes all the clients in the channel to reply the CTCP, for specific information. Additionally, CTCP can be used to encode messages that the raw IRC protocol would not allow to be sent over the link, such as messages containing newlines or the byte value 0 (NULL). CTCP does not establish a direct connection between clients; however, it is commonly used to negotiate DCC connections.

CTCP allows users to query a remote client about the version of the client they are using (via codice_1), or the time (via codice_2), among other things. It is also used to implement the /me command (via codice_3).

==History==
ircII was the first IRC client to implement the CTCP and DCC protocols. The CTCP protocol was implemented by Michael Sandrof in 1990 for ircII version 2.1, while the DCC protocol was implemented by Troy Rollo in 1991 for version 2.1.2.

==Structure==
A CTCP message is implemented as a codice_4 or codice_5 where the first and last characters of the message are ASCII value 0x01. Additionally, characters which would not be allowed in the IRC protocol are escaped. Since a codice_5 as the standard should not generate a reply, CTCP messages are sent as codice_4 and the reply is implemented with a codice_5 instead of a codice_4.

A CTCP query is initiated on most clients as follows:

Where &quot;&lt;target&gt;&quot; is the target nickname or channel, &quot;&lt;command&gt;&quot; is the CTCP command (e.g. codice_10), and &quot;&lt;arguments&gt;&quot; are additional information to be sent to the &quot;&lt;target&gt;&quot;.

==Common CTCP commands==
CTCP commands and replies are client-specific; as such, depending on the IRC client, some of the following CTCP commands may not trigger a response, or will be formatted differently than what is shown here.

===VERSION===
A codice_1 request will return the name and version of the IRC client the target is using, and in some cases technical information such as the operating system, clock rate, CPU Manufacturer and CPU architecture/instruction set.

A sample reply for a codice_1 request to a target that uses the HexChat client is:
===TIME===
A codice_2 request will return the local time of the target computer. Depending on the IRC client, the reply may consist of the date, the time (either in 12-hour format or 24-hour format), the year (e.g. 2012), and sometimes the time zone (e.g. EST).

A sample reply for a codice_2 request to a target that uses the ChatZilla client is:
===PING===
A codice_15 request will determine the ping rate that directly exists between two clients (i.e. discounting the server). The codice_15 command works by sending an (often) integer argument (a timestamp) to a target client, the target client then responds by supplying exactly the same numerical parameter. The difference between the original timestamp and the current timestamp is calculated, with the result being displayed to the user that initiated the &quot;CTCP PING&quot;. More often than not, a timestamp that utilises milliseconds is used due to the majority of users with broadband Internet connections having a ping under 1 second.

A sample codice_15 request to target &quot;&lt;nickname&gt;&quot; from the XChat client is:

Likewise, sample output generated from the difference (see above) is:

<text>The Xichang Satellite Launch Center (XSLC), also known as the Xichang Space Center, is a spaceport in China. It is located in (), Mianning county, approximately northwest of Xichang, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan.

It is operated by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Aerospace Force(formerly the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force) and is known as the 27th Experimental Training base(MUCD: Unit 63790).

The facility became operational in 1984 and is used to launch numerous civil, scientific, and military payloads annually. It is notable as the site of Sino-European space cooperation, with the launch of the first of two Double Star scientific satellites in December 2003. Chinese officials have indicated interest in conducting additional international satellite launches from XSLC.

In 1996, a fatal accident occurred when the rocket carrying the Intelsat 708 satellite failed on launch from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, killing at least 6 people in a nearby village. Uncontrolled debris from launches continues to fall in the vicinity, most recently in December 2023 and June 2024.

A 2007 test of an anti-satellite missile was launched from the center.

==History==
=== China&#x27;s first crewed space program ===
In order to support the Chinese Project 714 crewed space program in the 1960s, the construction of a new space center at Xichang in the Sichuan province was decided, located farther from the Soviet border, thus safer. This construction was part of the Third Front campaign to develop basic industry and national security industry in the rugged interior of China to prepare for potential United States or Soviet Union invasion.

The Shuguang One spacecraft was expected to be launched from the launch pad number one. After the cancellation of the program, the launch pad was never completed. Today, a viewing platform for officials has been built at the site.

===First Long March-2E carrier rocket===
China launched its first Long March-2E carrier rocket on July 16, 1990, sending into orbit Pakistan&#x27;s first indigenously developed Badr-1 satellite and HS-601.

===1996 Launch accident===
On February 15, 1996, a fatal accident occurred when the first new Long March 3B heavy carrier rocket carrying Intelsat 708 veered off course 22 seconds after launch, crashing 1200 meters away from the launch pad in a nearby mountain village, destroying 80 homes. According to the official report, six people died and 56 were injured. The number of civilian deaths has been disputed, with estimates of the number of casualties as around a few hundred.

===China&#x27;s first successful ASAT test===
On January 11, 2007, China conducted an anti-satellite missile test with an SC-19 ASAT weapon.

A Chinese weather satellite — the FY-1C polar orbit satellite of the Fengyun series, at an altitude of , with a mass of 750 kg — was destroyed by a kinetic kill vehicle.

The SC-19 has been described as being based on a modified DF-21 ballistic missile or its commercial derivative, the KT-2 with a Kinetic Kill Vehicle and is fully mobile.

===Beginning of China&#x27;s lunar exploration program===

On October 24, 2007, Chang&#x27;e 1, an un-crewed Moon orbiter of the Chang&#x27;e program, was successfully launched from the facility, marking the beginning of China&#x27;s lunar exploration program.

===First Long March-3C carrier rocket===
China launched its first Long March-3C carrier rocket on April 25, 2008. This was the 105th mission of China&#x27;s Long March series of rockets, and also the launch of the nation&#x27;s first data relay satellite (数据中继卫星) Tianlian I (天链一号).

A new launch pad for next-generation rockets (such as Long March 8) is currently under construction, as of December 2019.

==Facilities==

=== Launch Complexes ===
Three launch complexes were planned, and two were built:

Launch Complex 1 (LC-1), not built, was intended as the Shuguang launch site, later used as a viewing area.

Launch Complex 2 (LC-2 or LA-2), located at , and used for launching Long March 2E, Long March 3A, Long March 3B and Long March 3C rockets.

Launch Complex 3 (LC-3 or LA-3), also known as LA-1, and located at . Used for launching Long March 2C, Long March 3, Long March 3A and Long March 3B rockets. Demolished and rebuilt between 2005 and 2006. Upgraded in order to support the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program. Demolished and rebuilt again between 2013 and 2015.

Mobile Launcher Pad, is used by CASIC&#x27;s Kuaizhou-1A rocket to launch from Xichang.

===Technical Center===

XSLC&#x27;s Technical Center is equipped for testing and integration of the payload and launch vehicle. Its Mission Command and Control Center is located southwest of the launch pads, and provides flight and safety control during overall system rehearsal and launch. It is serviced by a dedicated railway and highway directly from Xichang Qingshan Airport and Manshuiwan railway station, which is about away from the launch site. Two launch complexes at the facility support flight operations.

<doc id="739838" wikidata="Q2302416" url="?curid=739838" title="TransHab">
<text>TransHab was a program pursued by NASA in the late 1990s to develop the technology for expandable habitats inflated by air in space. TransHab was intended as a replacement for the existing rigid International Space Station crew Habitation Module. When deflated, inflatable modules provide an &#x27;easier to launch&#x27; compact form. When fully inflated, TransHab would expand to in diameter (compare to the diameter of the Columbus ISS Module).

==History==
The name of the project is a contraction of &quot;Transit Habitat&quot; reflecting the original intention to design an interplanetary vehicle to transfer humans to Mars.

Considerable controversy arose during the TransHab development effort due to delays and increased costs of the ISS program. In 1999, the National Space Society issued a policy statement recommending that NASA continue R&amp;D of inflatable technologies while ceasing development of a TransHab ISS module. Finally in 2000, despite objections from the White House, House Resolution 1654 was signed into law banning NASA from conducting further research and development of TransHab. An option to lease an inflatable habitat module from private industry was included in the bill.

Since that time, the private company Bigelow Aerospace has purchased the rights to the patents developed by NASA and is pursuing a similar scheme for a private space station design. The company has launched the &quot;Genesis I&quot;, &quot;Genesis II&quot;, and BEAM pathfinder spacecraft, with plans for additional experimental craft culminating in their &quot;BA 330&quot; production model and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station.

==Technology==
The TransHab design called for a hybrid structure that combines the packaging and mass efficiencies of an inflatable structure with the advantages of a load-bearing hard structure.

===Multi-Layer Inflatable Shell===
TransHab&#x27;s inflatable shell consisted of multiple layers of blanket insulation, protection from orbital and meteoroid debris, an optimized restraint layer and a redundant bladder with a protective layer.

TransHab&#x27;s foot-thick inflatable shell design had almost two dozen layers. The layers were fashioned to break up particles of space debris and tiny meteorites that might hit the shell with a speed seven times as fast as a bullet. The outer layers protect multiple inner bladders, made of a material that holds in the module&#x27;s air. The shell also provides insulation from temperatures in space that can range from plus 121 degrees Celsius (plus 250 degrees Fahrenheit) in sunlight to minus 128 degrees Celsius (minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit) in the shade.

The key to the debris protection in the design and prototype units was successive layers of Nextel, a material commonly used as insulation under the hoods of many cars, spaced between several-inches-thick layers of open cell foam, similar to foam used for chair cushions on Earth. The Nextel and foam layers cause a particle to shatter as it hits, losing more and more of its energy as it penetrates deeper.

Many layers deep in the shell was a layer of superstrong woven Kevlar to hold the module&#x27;s shape. The air was held inside by three bladders of Combitherm, a material commonly used in the food-packing industry. The innermost layer, forming the inside wall of the module, was Nomex cloth, a fireproof material that also protected the bladder from scuffs and scratches.

===TransHab layout===


TransHab was intended to be composed of four levels/floors.

; Level 4
:The Pressurized Tunnel Area was intended to provide a passageway between TransHab and any vehicle to which it is attached. The original tunnel design had two standard International Space Station hatches and housed critical equipment required during module expansion, such as avionics and power equipment.

; Level 3
:Level Three was to house an exercise area with a treadmill and stationary bicycle. The design also contained a complete health care system with all types of medical and emergency equipment and a type of &quot;space bath&quot; area provided for body cleansing. In addition, this level contained a soft stowage area identical to level one.

:Crew Health Care Area – The design for the crew health care area incorporated two ISS Crew Health Care System racks, a Full Body Cleansing Compartment, changing area, exercise equipment (treadmill and ergometer), a partitionable area for private medical exams and conferencing, as well as an Earth-viewing window. The Earth-viewing window was to have been in diameter and was located near the exercise area. The window design had four panes totaling thick and a hard frame around each window that attaches to all layers of the shell.

:Stowage – Soft-sided cabinets was to have provided stowage for spare parts, supplies, clothing and other equipment. If built, TransHab would have doubled the stowage room available on the International Space Station.

; Level 2
:Crew Quarters – The crew quarters area design had six individual crew quarters, sized at of volume per crew quarter, and a central passageway located within the second level central core structure and water tanks. Each compartment contains a sleeping bag/sleep restraint, an area for stowing personal items, and a computer entertainment center for recreation and personal work.

:Mechanical – The mechanical room is external to the core structure and uses only half the floor space. It is acoustically and visually isolated. The other half of this area is a clerestory above the wardroom area. The mechanical room consists of an environmental control and life support system, power equipment and avionics equipment and provides return airflow from Level One and Level Three through openings.

; Level 1
:The first level was to house a kitchen with a refrigerator-freezer, microwave oven, water dispenser, and food preparation equipment as well as a table that seats 12, enough to allow an entire Station resident crew and replacement crew to sit together for meetings or meals. There were to be three galley racks, a large wardroom table, a soft stowage array and an Earth-viewing window identical to the window on Level 3.

<doc id="739850" wikidata="Q424228" url="?curid=739850" title="Histamine receptor">
<text>The histamine receptors are a class of G protein–coupled receptors which bind histamine as their primary endogenous ligand. Histamine is a neurotransmitter involved in various physiological processes. There are four main types of histamine receptors: H1, H2, H3, and H4. H1 receptors are linked to allergic responses, H2 to gastric acid regulation, H3 to neurotransmitter release modulation, and H4 to immune system function.

There are four known histamine receptors:
*H1 receptorPrimarily located on smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and neurons. Activation of H1 receptors mediates various responses, including smooth muscle contraction (leading to bronchoconstriction, intestinal cramping), increased vascular permeability (resulting in edema), and stimulation of sensory nerve endings (causing itching and pain). H1 antagonists, commonly known as antihistamines, are used to alleviate symptoms of allergies and allergic reactions.
*H2 receptorFound mainly in the stomach lining (parietal cells), H2 receptors regulate gastric acid secretion by stimulating the production of hydrochloric acid. H2 antagonists (H2 blockers) are used to reduce stomach acid production and treat conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers.
*H3 receptorPredominantly located in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in regions associated with neurotransmitter release and modulation. H3 receptors act as presynaptic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, regulating the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. Modulation of H3 receptors is being explored as a potential target for various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
*H4 receptorInitially discovered on immune cells, particularly mast cells, eosinophils, and T cells, H4 receptors are involved in immune responses, including chemotaxis (cellular movement in response to chemical signals) and cytokine production. These receptors play a role in inflammation and allergic reactions. Research on H4 receptors is ongoing to better understand their involvement in immune-related disorders and to develop potential therapeutic interventions.

==Comparison==
There are several splice variants of H3 present in various species. Though all of the receptors are 7-transmembrane g protein coupled receptors, H1 and H2 are quite different from H3 and H4 in their activities. H1 causes an increase in PIP2 hydrolysis, H2 stimulates gastric acid secretion, and H3 mediates feedback inhibition of histamine.

<doc id="739855" wikidata="Q760367" url="?curid=739855" title="Visual snow syndrome">
<text>Visual snow syndrome (VSS) is an uncommon neurological condition in which the primary symptom is that affected individuals see persistent flickering white, black, transparent, or colored dots across the whole visual field.

Other common symptoms are palinopsia, enhanced entoptic phenomena, photophobia, and tension headaches. The condition is typically always present and has no known cure, as viable treatments are still under research. Astigmatism, although not presumed connected to these visual disturbances, is a common comorbidity. Migraines and tinnitus are common comorbidities that are both associated with a more severe presentation of the syndrome. 

The cause of the syndrome is unclear. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve excessive excitability of neurons in the right lingual gyrus and left anterior lobe of the cerebellum. Another hypothesis proposes that visual snow syndrome could be a type of thalamocortical dysrhythmia and may involve the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). A failure of inhibitory action from the TRN to the thalamus may be the underlying cause for the inability to suppress excitatory sensory information. Research has been limited due to issues of case identification, diagnosis, and the limited size of any studied cohort, though the issue of diagnosis is now largely addressed. Initial functional brain imaging research suggests visual snow is a brain disorder.

== The difference between Visual Snow and Visual Snow Syndrome ==

Visual snow is a phenomenon where a person perceives visual disturbances, such as fine graininess or &quot;static,&quot; in their field of vision. This can occur in low-light conditions, in the dark, or when the visual system amplifies light perception. In these cases, visual snow is a normal reaction of the body, related to the way photoreceptors (rods) and neurons respond to weak or insufficient stimuli.

However, if visual snow becomes persistent and continuous — especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms, such as headaches, difficulty focusing, or intense visual distortions — it may indicate visual snow syndrome. This syndrome is not just a phenomenon, but a neurological disorder, where a person experiences constant visual disturbances, regardless of lighting conditions. Visual snow syndrome is often linked to heightened neural sensitivity in the visual system and may require diagnosis and treatment, as it could be associated with underlying eye conditions or neurological disorders.

In summary:

* Visual snow as a temporary occurrence under certain conditions is normal and doesn&#x27;t require intervention.
* Visual snow syndrome is a pathological condition, where visual disturbances persist constantly and may be caused by issues in the visual or nervous system, requiring medical attention.

== Signs and symptoms ==

In addition to visual snow, many of those affected have other types of visual disturbances such as starbursts, increased afterimages, floaters, trails, and many others.

Visual snow likely represents a clinical continuum, with different degrees of severity. The presence of comorbidities such as migraine and tinnitus is associated with a more severe presentation of visual symptoms.

Non-visual symptoms may include difficulty concentrating, insomnia, frequent migraines, nausea, and vertigo. 

===Diagnosis===

Visual snow syndrome is usually diagnosed with the following proposed criteria:

* Visual snow: dynamic, continuous, tiny dots observed across the entire visual field at any time of the day, regardless of lighting conditions, persisting for more than three months.
** The dots are usually black/gray on a white background and gray/white on a black background; however, they can also be transparent, white flashing, or colored.
* Presence of at least 2 additional visual symptoms of the 4 following categories:
** i. Palinopsia. At least 1 of the following: afterimages or trailing of moving objects.
** ii. Enhanced entoptic phenomena. At least 1 of the following: excessive floaters in both eyes, excessive blue field entoptic phenomenon, self-light of the eye (phosphenes), or spontaneous photopsia.
** iii. Photophobia.
** iv. Nyctalopia; impaired night vision.
* Symptoms are not consistent with typical migraine aura.
* Symptoms are not better explained by another disorder (ophthalmological, drug abuse).
** Normal ophthalmology tests (best-corrected visual acuity, dilated fundus examination, visual field, and electroretinogram); not caused by previous intake of psychotropic drugs.

Additional and non-visual symptoms like tinnitus, ear pressure, brain fog, and more might be present. It can also be diagnosed by PET scan.

=== Common misconceptions ===

* Perceiving visual static, flickering, or graininess on monochrome colors, in the sky, or in darkness can be a normal phenomenon associated with neural noise, amplified in the absence of bright visual stimuli. This effect is known as the Ganzfeld Effect. In conditions of low illumination, especially in dimly lit environments, this phenomenon is related to how the eyes and the brain process visual information in insufficient lighting. The visual system becomes more sensitive to light and can amplify noise or minor changes in visual signals. For example to the work of different types of photoreceptors in the retina of the eye. In the dark, the rod photoreceptors, which are responsible for the perception of light in low light, are mainly activated, but they are not able to distinguish details or colors. This is why in dim light we often see the world blurred and grainy, without clear contours. While cones (which are responsible for color perception and detail) are activated in brighter light, the rods provide vision in low light, but with a loss of precision. Therefore, the graininess we perceive in the dark is a natural adaptation of our vision to photoreceptor limitations, not a sign of some abnormality. It&#x27;s important to note that the perception of such phenomena may vary among different individuals due to individual differences in perception and sensitivity.
* When the eyes are closed, visual static may be related to the first level of visual hallucination.
* Eye pathologies or other neurological conditions can also be a cause of visual anomalies, including the appearance of visual static or other changes in perception. Additionally, psychological disorders, such as somatic disorders, could potentially contribute to these perceptual disturbances.

===Comorbidities===

Migraine and migraine with aura are common comorbidities. However, comorbid migraine worsens some of the additional visual symptoms and tinnitus seen in &quot;visual snow&quot; syndrome. This might bias research studies by patients with migraine being more likely to offer study participation than those without migraine due to having more severe symptoms. In contrast to migraine, comorbidity of typical migraine aura does not appear to worsen symptoms.

Psychological side effects of visual snow can include depersonalization, derealization, depression, photophobia, and heliophobia in the individual affected.

Patients with visual &quot;snow&quot; have normal equivalent input noise levels and contrast sensitivity. In a 2010 study, Raghaven et al. hypothesize that what the patients see as &quot;snow&quot; is eigengrau. This would also explain why many report more visual snow in low light conditions: &quot;The intrinsic dark noise of primate cones is equivalent to ~4000 absorbed photons per second at mean light levels; below this the cone signals are dominated by intrinsic noise&quot;.

==Causes==
The causes of VSS are not clear. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve excessive excitability of neurons within the cortex of the brain, specifically the right lingual gyrus and left cerebellar anterior lobe of the brain.

Persisting visual snow can feature as a leading addition to a migraine complication called persistent aura without infarction, commonly referred to as persistent migraine aura (PMA). In other clinical sub-forms of migraine headache may be absent and the migraine aura may not take the typical form of the zigzagged fortification spectrum (scintillating scotoma), but manifests with a large variety of focal neurological symptoms.

Visual snow does not depend on the effect of psychotropic substances on the brain. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), a condition caused by hallucinogenic drug use, is sometimes linked to visual snow, but both the connection of visual snow to HPPD and the cause and prevalence of HPPD are disputed. Most of the evidence for both is generally anecdotal and subject to spotlight fallacy. Visual snow has also been correlated with head trauma and infection.

==Timeline==
* In May 2015, visual snow was described as a persisting positive visual phenomenon distinct from migraine aura in a study by Schankin and Goadsby.
* In December 2020, a study found local increases in regional cerebral perfusion in patients with visual snow syndrome.
* In September 2021, two studies found white matter alterations in parts of the visual cortex and outside the visual cortex in patients with visual snow syndrome.
* In November 2023, a study revealed that glutamate and serotonin are involved in brain connectivity alterations in areas of the visual, salience, and limbic systems in VSS. Importantly, altered serotonergic connectivity is independent of migraine in VSS, and simultaneously comparable to that of migraine with aura, highlighting a shared biology between the disorders.

==Treatments==
It is difficult to resolve visual snow with treatment, but it is possible to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life through treatment, both of the syndrome and its comorbidities. In some studies, lamotrigine as a treatment for visual snow syndrome only showed efficacy in 20% of patients, and in one study, patients using lamotrigine even reported worsening symptoms. Medications that may be used include lamotrigine, acetazolamide, verapamil, clonazepam, propranolol, and sertraline but these do not always result in positive effects. As of 2021, two ongoing clinical trials were using transcranial magnetic stimulation and neurofeedback for visual snow.

A recent study in the &quot;British Journal of Ophthalmology&quot; has confirmed that common drug treatments are generally ineffective in visual snow syndrome (VSS). Vitamins and benzodiazepines, however, were shown to be beneficial in some patients and can be considered safe for this condition.

<text>The Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) is an independent anthropomorphic spacesuit that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts performing extravehicular activity (EVA) in Earth orbit. Introduced in 1974, it is a two-piece semi-rigid suit, and is currently one of two types of EVA spacesuits used by crew members on the International Space Station (ISS), the other being the Russian Orlan space suit. It was used by NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle astronauts prior to the end of the Shuttle program in 2011.

==Suit components==

The EMU, like the Apollo/Skylab A7L spacesuit, was the result of 21 years of research and development. It consists of a Space Suit Assembly (SSA) assembly which includes the Hard Upper Torso (HUT), arm sections, gloves, an Apollo-style &quot;bubble&quot; helmet, the Extravehicular Visor Assembly (EVVA), and a soft Lower Torso Assembly (LTA), incorporating the Body Seal Closure (BSC), waist bearing, brief, legs, and boots, and a Life Support System (LSS) which incorporates the Primary Life Support System (PLSS), electrical systems, and a Secondary Oxygen Pack (SOP). Prior to donning the pressure garment, the crew member puts on a Maximum Absorbency Garment (MAG) (basically a modified incontinence diaper – Urine Collection Devices (UCDs) are no longer used), and possibly a Thermal Control Undergarment (long johns). The final item donned before putting on the pressure suit is the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG), which incorporates clear plastic tubing through which chilled liquid water flows for body temperature control, as well as ventilation tubes for waste gas removal.

After donning the LCVG, the astronaut then puts on the LTA, before entering the airlock. The astronaut then dons the HUT, connects the LCVG umbilical to the umbilical in the HUT, and then locks the two parts of the suit together using the Body Seal Closure. Once the suit is turned on and checked out, the astronaut dons a &quot;Snoopy cap&quot;, a brown and white fabric communications cap dating back to the Apollo days, which incorporates a pair of earphones and microphones, allowing the EVA astronaut to communicate with both the crew members in the orbiter and ground controllers in Houston. After donning the &quot;Snoopy cap&quot;, the gloves and helmet are then locked on, pressurizing the suit. The suit&#x27;s regulator and fans activate when the servicing umbilicals are removed and the suit reaches an internal pressure of . A typical EMU can support an astronaut for 8.5 hours, including 30 minutes of reserves in the case of primary life support failure. To perform an EVA from the shuttle, the cabin pressure was reduced from for 24 hours, after which an astronaut had to pre-breathe for 45 minutes. For EVAs on board the ISS, the astronaut must pre-breathe for about four hours, although since 2006 most ISS EVAs have instead employed a &quot;camp out&quot; procedure where the spacewalk team sleeps in the Quest airlock module while the atmosphere is adjusted.

==Manufacturer==
The EMU hardware and accessories (PLSS, helmet, communications cap, and locking rings for the helmet and gloves), is manufactured by Hamilton Standard (now the Hamilton Sundstrand division of Collins Aerospace) out of Windsor Locks, Connecticut, while the suit&#x27;s soft components (the arms of the HUT and the entire LTU) are produced by ILC Dover (a former division of Playtex) out of Frederica, Delaware. The two companies, who were rivals during the early days of Apollo for the contract to build the &quot;Block II&quot; (moonwalking) space suit, teamed up in 1974 against the David Clark Company and Garrett AiResearch for the EMU development and construction. During Apollo, the ILC Dover-produced A7L used the life support backpack, helmet, and locking rings supplied by Hamilton Standard, but originally, ILC Dover was to just supply the arms and legs of the suit, a similar process that is still going on today.

In total 18 EMU suits with PLSS were manufactured; 5 were lost during missions, 1 was lost in ground test, and, as of 2017, 11 remain complete and functional.

==History==
Upon receiving the contract to build the EMU in 1974, Hamilton Standard and ILC Dover delivered the first EMU units to NASA in 1982. During the research and development phase (1975–1980), a suit being tested caught fire, injuring a technician and forcing a redesign on the regulator and circulation fan. On STS-4 in July 1982, the astronauts practiced donning and doffing the suit in the Shuttle&#x27;s airlock. The first Shuttle EVA was to occur on STS-5, but an electrical failure on the circulation fan forced the EVA to be cancelled. The first EVA of the new EMU finally occurred on STS-6 when Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson went out in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; and tested techniques to lower the launch cradle of a solid-fuel upper stage used to boost a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-A) into a geostationary orbit.

Other EVAs followed on the Shuttle, notably those on STS-41-B (the first Manned Maneuvering Unit flight), STS-41-C (the Solar Max repair mission), STS-41-G (the first American EVA involving a woman), and STS-51-A (where two stranded satellites were retrieved and returned to Earth), but the majority of EMU uses occurred on the servicing missions of the Hubble Space Telescope. For those flights, two sets of EVA astronauts would venture out of the orbiter, thus requiring NASA to fly four sets of suits (along with repair parts). 41 EVAs using EMUs had been conducted out of the Space Shuttle airlock prior to the start of ISS assembly in November 1998.

With the building of the ISS, Hamilton Sundstrand and ILC Dover refined the existing Shuttle EMU by making the suit modular. This allowed an EMU to be left on the ISS for up to two years and resized on-orbit to fit various crew members. The ISS EMUs also have increased battery capacity, the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER), improved cameras and radios, and a new caution and warning system. Another feature incorporated into the ISS suits is an additional battery to power heaters built into the glove, allowing astronauts to keep their hands warm during nighttime passages on each 95-minute orbit.

Currently, the ISS EMUs and the Russian Orlan suits are used by crews of all nationalities on the International Space Station. The two EMUs are stored within the Quest Joint Airlock.

==Future use and replacement==
, NASA plans to use Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) system during Artemis program, derived from the spacesuit technologies used in the past.

On June 1, 2022, NASA announced it had selected Axiom Space and Collins Aerospace to develop and provide astronauts with next generation spacesuit and spacewalk systems to work outside the International Space Station, explore the lunar surface on Artemis missions, and prepare for human missions to Mars.

<text>Ögedei Khan (also Ögedei Khagan or Ogodei; 11 December 1241) was the second ruler of the Mongol Empire. The third son of Genghis Khan, he continued the expansion of the empire that his father had begun.

Born in 1186 AD, Ögedei fought in numerous battles during his father&#x27;s rise to power. After being granted a large appanage and taking a number of wives, including Töregene, he played a prominent role in the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire. When his older brothers Jochi and Chagatai quarrelled over strategies when besieging Gurganj, Genghis appointed Ögedei sole commander; his successful capture of the city in 1221 ensured his military reputation. He was confirmed as heir after further infighting between his elder brothers led to both being excluded from succession plans. Genghis died in 1227, and Ögedei was elected as khan in 1229, after a two-year regency led by his younger brother Tolui.

As khan, Ögedei pursued the expansionist policies of his father. He launched a second invasion of Persia led by Chormaqan Noyan in 1230, which subdued the Khwarazmian prince Jalal al-Din and began to subjugate Georgia. He initiated the Mongol invasions of Korea in 1231 and completed the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty in 1234, and his armies skirmished with the Song dynasty and in India. By the time of his death in 1241, large armies under the command of his nephew Batu Khan and Subutai had subdued the steppes and penetrated deep into Europe. These armies defeated Poland at Legnica and Hungary at Mohi before retreating. It is likely that this retreat was caused by the need to find a successor after Ögedei&#x27;s death, although some scholars have speculated that the Mongols were simply unable to invade further because of logistical difficulties.

As an administrator, Ögedei continued to develop the fast-growing Mongol state. Working with officials such as Yelü Chucai, he developed &quot;ortogh&quot; trading systems, instituted methods of tax collection, and established regional bureaucracies which controlled legal and economic affairs. He also founded the Mongol capital city, Karakorum, in the 1230s. Although historically disregarded in comparison to his father, especially on account of his alcoholism, he was known to be charismatic, good-natured, and intelligent. He was succeeded by his son Güyük.

==Background==
Ögedei was the third son of Temüjin and Börte Ujin. He participated in the turbulent events of his father&#x27;s rise. When Ögedei was 17 years old, Temüjin experienced the disastrous defeat of Khalakhaljid Sands against the army of Jamukha. Ögedei was heavily wounded and lost on the battlefield. His father&#x27;s adopted brother and companion Borokhula rescued him. Although he was already married, in 1204 his father gave him Töregene, the wife of a defeated Merkit chief. The addition of such a wife was not uncommon in steppe culture.

After Temüjin was proclaimed Genghis Khan in 1206, &quot;myangans&quot; (thousands) of the Jalayir, Besud, Suldus, and Khongqatan clans were given to him as his appanage. Ögedei&#x27;s territory occupied the Emil and Hobok rivers. According to his father&#x27;s wish, Ilugei, the commander of the Jalayir, became Ögedei&#x27;s tutor.

Ögedei, along with his brothers, campaigned independently for the first time in November 1211 against the Jin dynasty. He was sent to ravage the land south through Hebei and then north through Shanxi in 1213. Ögedei&#x27;s force drove the Jin garrison out of the Ordos, and he rode to the juncture of the Xi Xia, Jin, and Song domains.

During the Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia, Ögedei and Chagatai massacred the residents of Otrar after a five-month siege in 1219–20 and joined Jochi who was outside the walls of Urganch. Because Jochi and Chagatai were quarreling over the military strategy, Ögedei was appointed by Genghis Khan to oversee the siege of Urganch. They captured the city in 1221. When the rebellion broke out in southeast Persia and Afghanistan, Ögedei also pacified Ghazni.

=== Position as heir ===
The Empress Yisui insisted that Genghis Khan designate an heir before the invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1219. After the terrible brawl between two elder sons Jochi and Chagatai, they agreed that Ögedei was to be chosen as heir. Genghis confirmed their decision.

Genghis Khan died in 1227, and Jochi had died a year or two earlier. Ögedei&#x27;s younger brother Tolui held the regency until 1229. Ögedei was elected supreme khan in 1229, according to the kurultai held at Kodoe Aral on the Kherlen River after Genghis&#x27; death, although this was never really in doubt as it was Genghis&#x27; clear wish that he be succeeded by Ögedei. After ritually declining three times, Ögedei was proclaimed Khan of the Mongols on 13 September 1229 at the &quot;Kurultai&quot; of the Kherlen&#x27;s Khödöö Aral. Chagatai continued to support his younger brother&#x27;s claim.

== World conquests ==

=== Expansion in the Middle East ===

After destroying the Khwarazmian empire, Genghis Khan was free to move against Western Xia. In 1226, however, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, the last of the Khwarizm monarchs, returned to Persia to revive the empire lost by his father, Muhammad ‘Ala al-Din II. The Mongol forces sent against him in 1227 were defeated at Dameghan. Another army that marched against Jalal al-Din scored a pyrrhic victory in the vicinity of Isfahan but was unable to follow up that success.

With Ögedei&#x27;s consent to launch a campaign, Chormaqan qorchi left Bukhara at the head of 30,000 to 50,000 Mongol soldiers. He occupied Persia and Khorasan, two long-standing bases of Khwarazmian support. Crossing the Amu Darya River in 1230 and entering Khorasan without encountering any opposition, Chormaqan passed through quickly. He left a sizable contingent behind under the command of Dayir Baghatur, who had further instructions to invade western Afghanistan. Chormaqan and the majority of his army then entered Tabaristan (modern-day Mazandaran), a region between the Caspian Sea and Alborz mountains, in the autumn of 1230, thus avoiding the mountainous area to the south, which was controlled by the Nizari Ismailis (the Assassins).

Upon reaching the city of Rey, Chormaqan made his winter camp there and dispatched his armies to pacify the rest of northern Persia. In 1231, he led his army southward and quickly captured the cities of Qum and Hamadan. From there, he sent armies into the regions of Fars and Kirman, whose rulers quickly submitted, preferring to pay tribute to Mongol overlords rather than having their states ravaged. Meanwhile, further east, Dayir Baghatur steadily achieved his goals in capturing Kabul, Ghazni, and Zabulistan. With the Mongols already in control of Persia, Jalal al-Din was isolated in Transcaucasia where he was banished. Thus all of Persia was added to the Mongol Empire.

=== The fall of the Jin dynasty ===
At the end of 1230, responding to the Jin&#x27;s unexpected defeat of Doqolqu cherbi (Mongol general), Ögedei went south to Shanxi with Tolui, clearing the area of the Jin forces and taking the city of Fengxiang. After passing the summer in the north, they again campaigned against the Jin in Henan, cutting through territory of South China to assault the Jin&#x27;s rear. By 1232 the Jin Emperor was besieged in his capital of Kaifeng. Ögedei soon departed, leaving the final conquest to his generals. After taking several cities, the Mongols, with the belated assistance of the Song dynasty, destroyed the Jin with the fall of Caizhou in February 1234. However, a viceroy of the Song murdered a Mongol ambassador, and the Song armies recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Chang&#x27;an, which were now ruled by the Mongols.

In addition to the war with the Jin dynasty, Ögedei crushed the Eastern Xia founded by Puxian Wannu in 1233, pacifying southern Manchuria. Ögedei subdued the Water Tatars in the northern part of the region and suppressed their rebellion in 1237.

=== Conquest of Georgia and Armenia ===

The Mongols under Chormaqan returned to the Caucasus in 1232. The walls of Ganjak were breached by catapult and battering ram in 1235. The Mongols eventually withdrew after the citizens of Irbil agreed to send a yearly tribute to Ögedei&#x27;s court. Chormaqan waited until 1238, when the force of Möngke Khan was also active in the north Caucasus. After subduing Armenia, Chormaqan took Tiflis. In 1238, the Mongols captured Lorhe whose ruler, Shahanshah, fled with his family before the Mongols arrived, leaving the rich city to its fate. After putting up a spirited defense at Hohanaberd, the city&#x27;s ruler, Hasan Jalal, submitted to the Mongols. Another column then advanced against Gaian, ruled by Prince Avak. The Mongol commander Tokhta ruled out a direct assault and had his men construct a wall around the city, and Avak soon surrendered. By 1240, Chormaqan had completed the conquest of Transcaucasia, forcing the Georgian nobles to surrender.

=== Korea ===
In 1224, a Mongol envoy was killed in obscure circumstances and Korea stopped paying tribute. Ögedei dispatched Saritai qorchi to subdue Korea and avenge the dead envoy in 1231. Thus, Mongol armies began to invade Korea in order to subdue the kingdom. The Goryeo King temporarily submitted and agreed to accept Mongol overseers. When they withdrew for the summer, however, Ch&#x27;oe U moved the capital from Kaesong to Ganghwa Island. Saritai was hit with a stray arrow and died as he campaigned against them.

Ögedei announced plans for the conquest of the Koreans, the Southern Song, the Kipchaks and their European allies, all of whom killed Mongol envoys, at the kurultai in Mongolia in 1234. Ögedei appointed Danqu commander of the Mongol army and made Bog Wong, a defected Korean general, governor of 40 cities with their subjects. When the court of Goryeo sued for peace in 1238, Ögedei demanded that the king of Goryeo appear before him in person. The Goryeo king finally sent his relative Yeong Nong-gun Sung with ten noble boys to Mongolia as hostages, temporarily ending the war in 1241.

=== Europe ===

The Mongol Empire expanded westward under the command of Batu Khan to subdue the western steppes and drive into Europe. Their western conquests included Volga Bulgaria, almost all of Alania, Cumania, and Kievan Rus&#x27;, along with a brief occupation of Hungary. They also invaded Poland, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, the Latin Empire, and Austria. During the siege of Kolomna, Ögedei&#x27;s half brother Khulgen was killed by an arrow.

Amid the conquest, Ögedei&#x27;s son Güyük and Chagatai&#x27;s grandson Büri ridiculed Batu, and the Mongol camp suffered dissension. Ögedei harshly criticized Güyük: &quot;You broke the spirit of every man in your army... Do you think that the Russians surrendered because of how mean you were to your own men?&quot;. He then sent Güyük back to continue the conquest of Europe. Güyük and another of Ögedei&#x27;s sons, Kadan and Melig attacked Transylvania and Poland, respectively.

Although Ögedei Khan had granted permission to invade the remainder of Europe, all the way to the &quot;Great Sea&quot;, the Atlantic Ocean, the Mongol advance stopped in East Europe early in 1242, the year after his death. Most historians agree with Mongol accounts which attribute the drive&#x27;s failure to his untimely demise necessitating Batu&#x27;s withdrawal to personally participate in the election of Ögedei&#x27;s successor. Batu, however, never reached Mongolia for such an election and a successor wouldn&#x27;t be named until 1246. A minority of historians have argued that the advance stalled because European fortifications posed a strategic problem for the Mongols.

=== Conflict with Song dynasty ===
In a series of razzias from 1235 to 1245, the Mongols commanded by Ögedei&#x27;s sons penetrated deep into the Song dynasty and reached Chengdu, Xiangyang and Yangtze River. But they could not succeed in completing their conquest due to climate and the number of Song troops, and Ögedei&#x27;s son Khochu died in the process. In 1240, Ögedei&#x27;s other son Khuden dispatched a subsidiary expedition to Tibet. The situation between the two nations worsened when Song officers murdered Ögedei&#x27;s envoys headed by Selmus.

The Mongol expansion throughout the Asian continent under the leadership of Ögedei helped bring political stability and re-establish the Silk Road, the primary trading route between East and West.

=== India ===
Ögedei appointed Dayir Baghatur in Ghazni and Menggetu noyan in Qonduz. In winter 1241 the Mongol force invaded the Indus valley and besieged Lahore, which was controlled by the Delhi Sultanate. However, Dayir Baghatur died storming the town, on 30 December 1241, and the Mongols butchered the town before withdrawing from the Delhi Sultanate.

Some time after 1235 another Mongol force invaded Kashmir, stationing a darughachi there for several years. Soon Kashmir became a Mongolian dependency. Around the same time, a Kashmiri Buddhist master, Otochi, and his brother Namo arrived at the court of Ögedei.

== Administration ==
Ögedei began the bureaucratization of Mongol administration. Three divisions constituted his administration: 
* the Christian eastern Turks, represented by Chinqai, the Uyghur scribe, and the Keraites.
* the Islamic circle, represented by two Khorazmians, Mahamud Yalavach, and Masud Beg.
*the North Chinese Confucian circle, represented by Yelu Chucai, a Khitan, and Nianhe Zhong-shan, a Jurchen.

Mahamud Yalavach promoted a system in which the government would delegate tax collection to tax farmers who collect payments in silver. Yelu Chucai encouraged Ögedei to institute a traditional Chinese system of government, with taxation in the hands of government agents and payment in a government issued currency. The Muslim merchants, working with capital supplied by the Mongol aristocrats, loaned at higher interest the silver needed for tax payments. In particular, Ögedei actively invested in these ortoq enterprises. At the same time the Mongols began circulating paper currency backed by silver reserves.

Ögedei abolished the branch departments of state affairs and divided the areas of Mongol-ruled China into ten routes according to the suggestion of Yelü Chucai. He also divided the empire into Beshbalik and Yanjing administration, while the headquarters in Karakorum directly dealt with Manchuria, Mongolia and Siberia. Late in his reign, Amu Darya administration was established. Turkestan was administered by Mahamud Yalavach, while Yelu Chucai administered North China from 1229 to 1240. Ögedei appointed Shigi Khutugh chief judge in China. In Iran, Ögedei appointed first Chin-temur, a Kara-kitai, and then Korguz, a Uyghur who proved to be honest administrator. Later, some of Yelu Chucai&#x27;s duties were transferred to Mahamud Yalavach and taxes were handed over to Abd-ur-Rahman, who promised to double the annual payments of silver. The Ortoq or partner merchants lent Ögedei&#x27;s money at exorbitant rates of interest to the peasants, though Ögedei banned considerably higher rates. Despite it proving profitable, many people fled their homes to avoid the tax collectors and their strong-arm gangs.

Ögedei had imperial princes tutored by the Christian scribe Qadaq and the Taoist priest Li Zhichang and built schools and an academy. Ögedei Khan also decreed to issue paper currency backed by silk reserves and founded a department responsible for destroying old notes. Yelu Chucai protested to Ögedei that his large-scale distribution of appanages in Iran, Western and North China, and Khorazm could lead to a disintegration of the empire. Ögedei thus decreed that the Mongol nobles could appoint overseers in the appanages, but the court would appoint other officials and collect taxes.

He proclaimed the Great Yassa as an integral body of precedents, confirming the continuing validity of his father&#x27;s commands and ordinances, while adding his own. Ögedei codified rules of dress and conduct during the kurultais. Throughout the empire, in 1234, he created postroad stations (Yam) with a permanent staff who would supply post riders&#x27; needs. Relay stations were set up every 25 miles and the yam staff supplied remounts to the envoys and served specified rations. The attached households were exempt from other taxes, but they had to pay a qubchuri tax to supply the goods. Ögedei ordered Chagatai and Batu to control their yams separately. He also prohibited the nobility from issuing paizas (tablets that gave the bearer authority to demand goods and services from civilian populations) and jarliqs. Ögedei decreed that within decimal units one out of every 100 sheep of the well-off should be levied for the poor of the unit, and that one sheep and one mare from every herd should be forwarded to form a herd for the imperial table.

=== Karakorum ===

From 1235 to 1238 Ögedei constructed a series of palaces and pavilions at stopping places in his annual nomadic route through central Mongolia. The first palace Wanangong was constructed by North Chinese artisans. The Emperor urged his relatives build residences nearby and settled the deported craftsmen from China near the site. The construction of the city, Karakorum (Хархорум), was finished in 1235, assigning different quarters to Islamic and North Chinese craftsmen, who competed to win Ögedei&#x27;s favor. Earthen walls with 4 gates surrounded the city. Attached were private apartments, while in front of stood a giant stone tortoise bearing an engraved pillar, like those that were commonly used in East Asia. There was a castle with doors like the gates of the garden and a series of lakes where many water fowl gathered. Ögedei erected several houses of worship for his Buddhist, Muslim, Taoist, and Christian followers. In the Chinese ward, there was a Confucian temple where Yelu Chucai used to create or regulate a calendar on the Chinese model.

== Character ==
Ögedei was also known to be a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor but not a dictator. Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father&#x27;s plan to establish a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was a pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.

Ögedei was considered to be his father&#x27;s favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult, he was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by the force of his personality. He was a physically big, jovial, and charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the Mongol Empire on the path that his father had set. Ögedei was a pragmatic man, though he made some mistakes during his reign. Ögedei had no delusions that he was his father&#x27;s equal as a military commander or organizer and used the abilities of those he found most capable.

Ögedei was well known for his alcoholism. Chagatai entrusted an official to watch his habit, but Ögedei managed to drink anyway. It is commonly told that Ögedei did so by vowing to reduce the number of cups he drank a day then having cups twice the size created for his personal use. When he died at dawn on 11 December 1241, after a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman, the people blamed the sister of Tolui&#x27;s widow and Abd-ur-Rahman. The Mongol aristocrats recognized, however, that the khan&#x27;s own lack of self-control had killed him.

The sudden death of Tolui in 1232 seems to have affected Ögedei deeply. According to some sources, Tolui sacrificed his own life, accepting a poisoned drink in shamanist ritual in order to save Ögedei who was suffering from illness. Other sources say Ögedei orchestrated Tolui&#x27;s death with the help of shamans who drugged the alcoholic Tolui.

According to Pamela Kyle Crossley, a posthumous Yuan dynasty portrait of Ögedei depicts him as having a stocky build, a red beard, and hazel eyes. Contemporary Chinese authors such as Xu Ting wrote that Ögedei&#x27;s beard was unusual for a Mongol because most had little facial hair.

===Alleged mass rape===
According to Persian chroniclers, Ögedei ordered the rape of four thousand Oirat girls above the age of seven. These girls were then confiscated for Ögedei&#x27;s harem or given to caravan hostels throughout the Mongol Empire for use as prostitutes. This move brought the Oirat and their lands under Ögedei&#x27;s control following the death of Ögedei&#x27;s sister Checheyigen, who previously controlled Oirat lands.

Anne F. Broadbridge links an &quot;infamous alleged mass rape of Oirat girls&quot; to Ögedei&#x27;s requisitioning of girls from his uncle Temüge Otchigin&#x27;s territories without Temüge&#x27;s approval. Broadbridge notes however that &quot;with all the evidence suppressed, this can only be a surmise&quot;. The History of the Yuan or &quot;Yuanshi&quot; and Secret History of the Mongols speak of a forceful requisitioning of women by Ögedei from the &quot;left wing&quot; and &quot;uncle Otchigin&#x27;s domain&quot; respectively but do not mention a rape. In the Secret History Ögedei expresses remorse for his act stating &quot;as to my second fault, to listen to the word of a woman without principle, and to have the girls of my uncle Otchigin&#x27;s domain brought to me was surely a mistake&quot; but De Rachewiltz notes that the entire paragraph listing four good deeds and four mistakes may be a posthumous assessment.

The only account alleging a rape is in Chapter 32 of the Tarikh-i Jahangushay (History of the World Conqueror) written in 1252 by Juvayni (1226–1283). In Chapter 32 Juvayni starts by praising Ögedei Khan then proceeds to give 50 highly detailed anecdotes to illustrate Ögedei&#x27;s &quot;clemency, forgiveness, justice and generosity&quot; followed by one anecdote to illustrate his &quot;violence, severity, fury and awesomeness&quot; which was the rape incident. This anecdote closes the chapter. The name of the tribe is unclear in two manuscripts of Juvayni but Manuscript D and Rashid-Al-Din give it as Oirat. Broadbridge and De Rachewiltz questioned the factual accuracy of this identification with the Oirats.

==Death and aftermath==
In the Tarikh-i Jahangushay claims Ögedei died shortly after his lion-like hounds chased and tore to pieces a wolf he saved and released despite his having hoped God Almighty would spare his ill bowels if he released a living creature. This anecdote (Anecdote 47) contradicts the standard account of Ögedei&#x27;s death from a late-night drinking bout with Abd-ur-Rahman.

In the early 1230s, Ögedei had nominated his son Kuchu as his heir; following Kuchu&#x27;s death in 1236, he named his grandson Shiremun as his heir. His preference was not binding on the Mongols. Güyük eventually succeeded him after the five-year regency of his widow Töregene Khatun. However, Batu, the Khan of the Golden Horde (also known as the Kipchak Khanate or the Ulus of Jochi), only nominally accepted Güyük, who died on the way to confront Batu. It was not until 1255, well into the reign of Möngke Khan, that Batu felt secure enough to again prepare to invade Europe. He died before his plans could be implemented.

When Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty in 1271, he had Ögedei Khan placed on the official record as Taizong (). Ögedei was also given the posthumous name of Emperor Yingwen (英文皇帝) in 1266.

== Wives, concubines, and children ==

Like his father Genghis Khan, Ögedei had many wives and sixty concubines: Ögedei married first Boraqchin and then Töregene. Other wives included Möge Khatun (former concubine of Genghis Khan) and Jachin Khatun.

Principal wives:
* Empress Boraqchin (孛剌合真皇后)

<doc id="739866" wikidata="Q1503089" url="?curid=739866" title="World Saxophone Quartet">
<text>The World Saxophone Quartet was an American jazz ensemble founded in 1977, incorporating elements of free jazz, R&amp;B, funk and South African jazz into their music.

The original members were Julius Hemphill (alto and soprano saxophone, flute), Oliver Lake (alto and soprano saxophone), Hamiet Bluiett (baritone saxophone, alto clarinet), and David Murray (tenor saxophone, bass clarinet). The first three had worked together as members of the Black Artists&#x27; Group in St. Louis, Missouri, and had appeared together on Anthony Braxton&#x27;s album &quot;New York, Fall 1974&quot;. In 1991, Hemphill left the group due to illness, and was replaced by Arthur Blythe, although several saxophonists have filled his chair in the years since. Hemphill died on April 2, 1995. Beginning in the early 1980s, the quartet used Bluiett&#x27;s composition &quot;Hattie Wall&quot; (released on &quot;W.S.Q.&quot;, &quot;Live in Zurich&quot;, &quot;Dances and Ballads&quot;, &quot;Steppenwolf&quot; and &quot;Yes We Can&quot;) as a signature theme for the group. The group principally recorded and performed as a saxophone quartet, usually with a line-up of two altos, tenor, and baritone (reflecting the composition of a classical string quartet), but were also joined later in their career by drummers, bassists, and other musicians. Occasionally other saxophonists would sit in or substitute for a tour. These guests have included Sam Rivers, Tony Kofi, Steve Potts, Branford Marsalis, James Spaulding and Jorge Sylvester. Hamiet Bluiett died on October 4, 2018, after an extended illness. The ensemble had split up in 2016.

<text>Marble Palace is a palatial nineteenth-century mansion in North Kolkata. It is located at 46, Muktaram Babu Street, Kolkata 700007. It is one of the best-preserved and most elegant houses of nineteenth-century Calcutta. The mansion is famous for its marble walls, floors, and sculptures, from which it derives its name.

==History of Marble Palace==

The house was built in 1835 by Raja Rajendra Mullick, a wealthy Bengali merchant with a passion for collecting works of art. The house continues to be a residence for his descendants, and the current occupants are the family of Raja Rajendra Mullick Bahadur. Raja Rajendra Mullick was the adopted son of Nilmoni Mullick, who built a Jagannath temple which predates Marble Palace, and still stands within the premises, but is only accessible to members of the family.

==Architecture==
The house is Neoclassical in style, while the plan with its open courtyards is largely traditional Bengali. Adjacent to the courtyard, there is a &quot;thakur-dalan&quot;, or place of worship for members of the family. The three-story building has tall fluted Corinthian pillars and ornamented verandas with fretwork and sloping roofs, built in the style of a Chinese pavilion. The premises also include a garden with lawns, a rock garden, a lake and a small zoo.

==Collections==
Marble Palace houses many Western sculptures, pieces of Victorian furniture, paintings by European and Indian artists, and other artifacts. Decorative objects include large chandeliers, clocks, floor to ceiling mirrors, urns, and royal busts. The house contains two paintings by Peter Paul Rubens, &quot;The Marriage of St. Catherine&quot; and &quot;The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian&quot;. There are also said to be two paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds, &quot;The Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpent&quot; and &quot;Venus and Cupid&quot;. Other artists said to figure in the collections include Titian, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, and John Opie.

The collection of artifacts is lavish but random; genuinely valuable pieces of art share space with a lot of kitschy art objects of little value. This has caused some to feel the collection is superficial and gaudy. Geoffrey Moorhouse in his book &quot;Calcutta&quot; says it looks &quot;as if they had been scavenged from job lots on the Portobello Road on a series of damp Saturday afternoons.&quot;

==Appearances in fiction==
The final scene of the French novel &quot;Le vol des cigognes&quot; de Jean-Christophe Grangé takes place in the Marble Palace.

==Access==
Because Marble Palace remains a private residence, photography is prohibited. Entry is free, but a permit must be obtained 24 hours in advance from the West Bengal Tourism Information Bureau at B. B. D. Bagh, Kolkata. Inside the house, there are guides who give visitors a tour of the house, although the parts of the house which are still inhabited remain off-limits. Marble Palace is open from 10am to 4pm on all days except Mondays and Thursdays.

<doc id="739875" wikidata="Q4947936" url="?curid=739875" title="Boston Hollow">
<text>Boston Hollow is a deep ravine in Ashford, Connecticut. It is a unique location in several ways. In geological terms it is an ancient fault in the Central Maine Terrane of the eastern highlands of Connecticut. More specifically, it lays within the Bigelow Brook Formation which consists of high grade pelitic schists and gneisses. Although there are many faults in this region, none is as deeply cleft, well pronounced, nor well preserved as this hollow.

==Accessibility==
Boston Hollow is approached from the southwest, from Westford, by unpaved Boston Hollow Road. This is a portion of the historic Center Turnpike, constructed in 1827, that was formerly a major route from Boston to Hartford.
The road follows a nearly straight course through the bottom of the hollow beside a little, unnamed brook for about two thirds of its passage. Then the brook peters out and a height of land is achieved. Continuing along the road towards the northeast, another swath in the ground forms but this is rarely filled with water. The second gully leads into a swamp at the end of the hollow. Near the end of the hollow a ten-acre (4 ha) parcel of land is situated. This land has an inactive gravel pit against the hollow wall. The only house in the area is located just past this land. The brook and the second swath as well as the house and the private land are all on the west side of the hollow. 

==Geography==
The geography of Boston Hollow is characterized by the deep fault-cleft running almost perfectly straight in the northeast direction. The basement of the hollow is approximately above sea level at the southern head, and at the swamp at the northern exit. The height of land is about above sea level. The hollow defined by the distance the road passes through its bottom is nearly long. The elevation change through the bottom of the hollow is therefore quite gradual. The width of the base from wall to wall varies from . 

On the west side there are swampy and stagnant wetlands through much of the course of the hollow brook as the water flow is too little and the incline is too slight to adequately drain the area. On either side of the low land the walls of the hollow rise swiftly. On the west side they rise most steeply to a height of about . The elevation gain is so rapid that a hike up the steep faces is in fact a climb. Towards the middle-northern end of the western hollow the wall is sheer rock for spaces of more than vertically and these overhangs are at such an incline that they form concave overhangs beneath which angular blocks of fallen stone lie. The top of the west ridge is undulating with there being several extant peaks or heights. This massif has no proper name.

On the east side the hollow wall rises directly from the road. This wall is steep but there is less exposed ledge than there is on the west side. After a relatively short distance of grave incline the hill rises less steeply. This hill is given the appellation Turkey Hill. However, Turkey Hill attains a greater height than the west ridge, reaching higher than above sea level. There are several pond-like swamps on the plateau of Turkey Hill. 

The property that contains the hollow is part of the Yale-Myers Forest. This is a forest owned by Yale University and used for teaching and scientific research as well as commercial timber production. There is also land owned by Hull Forest Products of Pomfret, CT in the area but this is not in the hollow proper. The Yale-Myers Forest is private land, but it is not posted as &#x27;No Trespassing&#x27;. There is one marked trail that goes through the Boston Hollow. This is the Nipmuck Trail. It enters the hollow from the southeast after passing over the glacier scoured ridges and plateau of Turkey Hill. The trail crosses Boston Hollow road at the middle northern end of the Hollow and swiftly ascends the west ridge.

On the west side of the trail for the first part of its passage on the west ridge there is a little valley or sump that is often filled with water during the winter and other wet periods. There has been ice that can be walked on in this sump as late as March, attesting to the coldness of this area. The trail ascend a series of ridges to a summit. This summit is shear bedrock and devoid of trees in the southeast direction (i.e. facing into the hollow). To the west there is a brief tree-covered plateau after which the topography slopes down to a large swamp. The trail continues after the summit in a southwest direction then turns in a serpentine arc and descends northwest of the hollow onto Barlow&#x27;s Mill road.

==Wildlife==
The flora and fauna of the hollow include species typical of southern New England, however, more boreal species are also found in this rugged region. The base of the hollow in densely forested with hemlock trees. These evergreens block much of the little light that reaches into this narrow chasm, therefore the hollow&#x27;s floor is always quite dark. above the low lands, on the hollow ridges hardwoods grow, the most common of which is red oak. The forest around the summit of the west ridge consists mainly of short red oaks. On the side of Turkey Hill facing the west ridge the tree growth is similar except that quite a few paper birch have colonised this slope whereas there are hardly any on the west ridge. The groves of paper birches make a pleasing visage in the fall when they are viewed from the summit of the west ridge.

Notable flora in Boston Hollow includes the mountain maple, a shrub-like tree that commonly grows in northern New England. Fauna consist of white-tailed deer, coyotes, and other animals of New England. It is probable that there are moose and American black bear inhabiting the dense forest preserves surrounding the hollow.

It is worn on spacewalks outside the International Space Station (ISS), and was worn on spacewalks outside the Space Shuttle. So far, there has not been an emergency in which it was needed. SAFER is a small, simplified version of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), which was used for regular maneuvering.

== Description ==
SAFER is fitted around the life support backpack of the space suit (EMU or Extravehicular Mobility Unit). SAFER in no way interferes with suit mobility. The flight test unit was fitted with a single hand control module rigidly attached to the Display and Control Module (DCM) in front of the suit. The hand controller provided six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) maneuvering via 24 gaseous-nitrogen (GN2) thrusters. Vehicle weight is 85 pounds. The GN2 is stored in four cylindrical tanks, each charged to 3250 psi. Total fuel capacity is 3 pounds which is sufficient to change the vehicle velocity approximately 10 feet/second (ΔV). The unit features very extensive self-test capability.

==Application==
SAFER is designed to be used as a self-rescue device if in spite of precautions such as tethers, safety grips, and the robot arm an EVA crewmember gets separated and no vehicles can provide rescue capability. SAFER is worn by every ISS crewmember using an Extravehicular Mobility Unit. 

SAFER was co-invented by former astronauts Joseph Kerwin, Paul Cottingham and Ted Christian under a Lockheed contract to NASA for Space Station Freedom. It was later sponsored by the Space Shuttle Program and developed by Lockheed and NASA personnel. SAFER was the design solution to the Shuttle Program&#x27;s requirement to provide a means of self rescue should an EVA crewmember become untethered during an EVA.

SAFER was first flown on STS-64 September 9, 1994, where an untethered flight test was performed first by astronaut Mark Lee and then Carl Meade. Both astronauts flew the SAFER up and around the Shuttle&#x27;s Robotic Arm along with a demonstration test of the SAFER&#x27;s automatic attitude hold feature. This feature arrests uncontrolled rotation of a detached crewmember expected in an accidental separation. SAFER has a mass of approximately 83 lb (38 kg) and can provide a total change in velocity (delta-v) of at least 10 ft/s (3 m/s). It was also tested during flight STS-92 when astronauts Peter Wisoff and Michael López-Alegría performed test maneuvers, flying up to 50 feet (15 m) while remaining tethered to the spacecraft.

==Complications==

The left side latch on the SAFER unit became unlatched during an EVA by astronaut Piers Sellers on STS-121 while testing shuttle repair techniques. The latch had been inadvertently bumped and moved to the unlatch position. As a precaution, Mike Fossum tethered it to him and the spacewalk continued. In subsequent spacewalks, the latches were secured with Kapton tape, a space-rated form of adhesive tape, to prevent the latches from inadvertently opening.

<text>Apollo Sunshine was an alternative rock band from Boston, Massachusetts.

==History==
===Founding===
Sam Cohen, Jesse Gallagher, and Jeremy Black originally met in 1997 in Boston, where the three were attending a Berklee College of Music summer performance program.

===Albums===
The band released their first album, &quot;Katonah&quot;, in 2003 on SpinART records. The album was recorded in Katonah, New York in a barn which the band converted into a studio, and produced by Andy Edelstein, a professor at Berklee. The first single, &quot;I Was on the Moon&quot;, was released in 2003.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described their sound as &quot;bouncy 60&#x27;s-style melodies crack wide open, breaking into outbursts of pummeling and feedback before jumping back into the tune. It&#x27;s all neatly and cleverly plotted, but with a looming chaos that&#x27;s anything but nostalgic.&quot;

The band released their second album &quot;Apollo Sunshine&quot; in 2005. In November 2005, it was named to the Amazon.com Best of 2005: Editors&#x27; Picks in Rock list at number 5 and the band was featured in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as an &quot;Artist to Watch&quot;. Several Boston alternative weeklies declared Apollo Sunshine the best Boston band in their 2005 year-end issues. In 2006, Apollo Sunshine toured with The Slip and Sam Champion en route to SXSW.

Their third album, &quot;Shall Noise Upon&quot;, was released on vinyl and as a digital download on August 5, 2008. It was released on CD September 2, 2008.

The band has been inactive since 2010.

<text>Jonathan William Lipnicki (born October 22, 1990) is an American actor who is known for his roles as a child actor. He has appeared in films such as &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), &quot;Stuart Little&quot; (1999) and &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; (2002), &quot;The Little Vampire&quot; (2000), and &quot;Like Mike&quot; (2002). He also starred in the television series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; on The WB and &quot;Meego&quot; on CBS.

==Early life==
Jonathan William Lipnicki was born on October 22, 1990, in Westlake Village, California, to Joseph Lipnicki and Rhonda Rosen. He has an older sister, Alexis. His father owns the mixed martial arts promotion firm Fight Sports Entertainment. His family is Jewish and he had a Bar Mitzvah.

He was educated at Agoura High School, a public secondary school in the city of Agoura Hills in Los Angeles County, California.

==Career==
Lipnicki played the son of a single parent in his film debut &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;. He subsequently appeared on &quot;The Single Guy&quot;, &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot; as well as episodes of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; and the 1997 sitcom, &quot;Meego&quot;. He played George Little in &quot;Stuart Little&quot; and its sequel &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot;.

He also played the lead, Tony Thompson, in the 2000 film, &quot;The Little Vampire&quot; and co-starred with hip-hop rapper Bow Wow in the 2002 sports film, &quot;Like Mike&quot;, which was released two weeks before &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot;. The latter films did relatively well in theaters, and Lipnicki has become known among preteen audiences, although he has focused mostly on independent films.

Lipnicki has also appeared in the season preview of Jamie Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Blowin&#x27; Up&quot; and &quot;When Zachary Beaver Came to Town&quot;.

He appeared on the comedy &quot;Motherlover&quot; on the YOMYOMF Network. Lipnicki currently trains in mixed martial arts styles, but when asked whether he planned to ever fight professionally, he replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve been pretty busy filming and I would need to put off a certain amount of time to really train for a fight and be in amazing cardio shape and really work on my striking more. I&#x27;m not saying no and I&#x27;m not saying yes.&quot;

Lipnicki completed lead roles in the horror-thriller motion picture &quot;Broil&quot;, produced by the team behind &quot;It Follows&quot;, and the comedy-drama motion picture &quot;Pooling To Paradise&quot; opposite Taryn Manning and Jordan Carlos. He also guest-starred in Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s and Philip Noyce&#x27;s &quot;The Resident&quot;.

In 2022, it was announced to the public that Lipnicki will be starring in the horror film &quot;Camp Pleasant Lake&quot; as the character Jasper Meadows.

==Philanthropy==
Lipnicki has been a speaker for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and is actively involved with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Starlight Children Foundation and the NBA&#x27;s &quot;Read to Achieve program&quot;. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation named Lipnicki one of its &quot;Heroes of 2001&quot; at the age of ten, for his work with the organization.

Additionally, Lipnicki has been an international spokesperson for Pediatric Chiropractic and Kids Day America/International and has worked with animal rights groups such as Pets and Their Stars and the Nutz for Mutts group.

== Personal life ==
Lipnicki dated Becca Mason in 2018, after meeting on the reality show &quot;Celebs Go Dating&quot;. They later broke-up.

Lipnicki is a trained martial arts practitioner and holds a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and still maintaining his fitness routine. In 2021, following an uptick in antisemitic attacks, Lipnicki teamed up with security firm Magen Am to escort Jews to synagogues. 

Lipnicki currently resides in Oklahoma after becoming executive producer for Buffalo 8 Production.

<doc id="739891" wikidata="Q44468" url="?curid=739891" title="Canadarm">
<text>Canadarm or Canadarm1 (officially Shuttle Remote Manipulator System or SRMS, also SSRMS) is a series of robotic arms that were used on the Space Shuttle orbiters to deploy, manoeuvre, and capture payloads. After the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, the Canadarm was always paired with the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), which was used to inspect the exterior of the shuttle for damage to the thermal protection system.

== Development ==
In 1969, Canada was invited by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to participate in the Space Shuttle program. At the time what that participation would entail had not yet been decided but a manipulator system was identified as an important component. Canadian company DSMA ATCON had developed a robot to load fuel into CANDU nuclear reactors; this robot attracted NASA&#x27;s attention. In 1975, NASA and the Canadian National Research Council (NRC) signed a memorandum of understanding that Canada would develop and construct the Canadarm.

NRC awarded the manipulator contract to Spar Aerospace (now MDA). Three systems were constructed within this design, development, test, and evaluation contract: an engineering model to assist in the design and testing of the Canadarm, a qualification model that was subjected to environmental testing to qualify the design for use in space, and a flight unit.

===End effector===
Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Zubrzycki, a design engineer at DSMA ATCON, while seconded to SPAR, originated the concept for the Canadarm End Effector, inspired by an elastic band around his fingers. Zubrzycki formally presented this concept to NASA officials. Frank Mee, head of the SPAR mechanical development laboratory, built the end effector prototype based on Tony&#x27;s concept and is credited by SPAR as the inventor of the Canadarm End Effector. The three-wire crossover design won over the claw-like mechanisms and others, such as the camera iris model, that were being considered.

===Controls and software=== 
The main control algorithms were developed by SPAR and by subcontractor Dynacon Inc. of Toronto. CAE Electronics Ltd. in Montreal provided the display and control panel and the hand controllers located in the Shuttle aft flight deck. Other electronic interfaces, servo amplifiers, and power conditioners located on the Canadarm were designed and built by SPAR at its Montreal factory. The graphite composite boom that provides the structural connection between the shoulder and the elbow joint and the similar boom that connects the elbow to the wrist were produced by General Dynamics in the United States. Dilworth, Secord, Meagher and Associates, Ltd. in Toronto was contracted to produce the engineering model end effector then SPAR evolved the design and produced the qualification and flight units. The Space Shuttle flight software that monitors and controls the Canadarm was developed in Houston, Texas, by the Federal Systems Division of IBM. Rockwell International&#x27;s Space Transportation Systems Division designed, developed, tested, and built the systems used to attach the Canadarm to the payload bay of the orbiter.

An acceptance ceremony for NASA was held at Spar&#x27;s RMS Division in Toronto on 11 February 1981. Here Larkin Kerwin, then the head of the NRC, gave the SRMS the informal name, Canadarm. The term was originally coined by Dr. Wally Cherwinski for use by Larkin Kerwin during his speech at the press conference. The NRC Canadarm Project Manager, Dr. Art Hunter, worked with colleagues, NASA and Spar, to add the Canadian flag and wordmark onto the arm to fly Canadian colours with those of the USA.

The first Canadarm was delivered to NASA in April 1981. Astronaut Judith Resnik developed the NASA software and onboard operating procedures for the system. In all, five arms – Nos. 201, 202, 301, 302, and 303 – were built and delivered to NASA. Arm 302 was lost in the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident.

== Design and capabilities ==
The original Canadarm was capable of deploying payloads weighing up to in space. In the mid-1990s, the arm control system was redesigned to increase the payload capability to in order to support space station assembly operations. While able to maneuver payloads with the mass of a loaded bus in space, the arm motors cannot lift the arm&#x27;s own weight when on the ground. NASA, therefore, developed a model of the arm for use at its training facility within the Johnson Space Center located in Houston, Texas. The Canadarm can also retrieve, repair and deploy satellites, provide a mobile extension ladder for extravehicular activity crew members for work stations or foot restraints, and be used as an inspection aid to allow the flight crew members to view the orbiter&#x27;s or payload&#x27;s surfaces through a television camera on the Canadarm.

The basic Canadarm configuration consists of a manipulator arm, a Canadarm display, and a control panel, including rotational and translational hand controllers at the orbiter aft flight deck flight crew station, and a manipulator controller interface unit that interfaces with the orbiter computer. One crew member operates the Canadarm from the aft flight deck control station, and a second crew member usually assists with television camera operations. This allows the Canadarm operator to view Canadarm operations through the aft flight deck payload and overhead windows and through the closed-circuit television monitors at the aft flight deck station.

The Canadarm is outfitted with an explosive-based mechanism to allow the arm to be jettisoned. This safety system would have allowed the Orbiter&#x27;s payload bay doors to be closed in the event that the arm failed in an extended position and was not able to be retracted.

The Canadarm is long and diameter with six degrees of freedom. It weighs by itself, and as part of the total system. The Canadarm has six joints that correspond roughly to the joints of the human arm, with shoulder yaw and pitch joints, an elbow pitch joint, and wrist pitch, yaw, and roll joints. The end effector is the unit at the end of the wrist that grapples the payload&#x27;s grapple fixture. The two lightweight boom segments are called the upper and lower arms. The upper boom connects the shoulder and elbow joints, and the lower boom connects the elbow and wrist joints.

== Service history ==

A simulated Canadarm installed on the was seen when the prototype orbiter&#x27;s payload bay doors were open to test hangar facilities early in the Space Shuttle program. The Canadarm was first tested in orbit in 1981, on &#x27;s STS-2 mission. Its first operational use was on STS-3 to deploy and manoeuvre the Plasma Diagnostics Package. Canadarm subsequently flew on more than 90 missions with all five orbiters.

Since the installation of the Canadarm2 on the International Space Station (ISS), the two arms have been used to hand over segments of the station for assembly from the orbiter&#x27;s Canadarm to the Canadarm2; the use of both elements in tandem has earned the nickname of &quot;Canadian Handshake&quot; in the media.

=== Retirement ===
The Canadarm&#x27;s 90th and final Shuttle mission was in July 2011 on STS-135, delivering the &quot;Raffaello&quot; MPLM to the ISS and back. It is on display with &quot;Atlantis&quot; at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s Canadarm is displayed next to it in the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Udvar-Hazy Center. &quot;Endeavour&quot; left its OBSS at the International Space Station as part of its final mission, while its Canadarm was originally going to be displayed in the headquarters of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). However, &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s Canadarm is now on permanent display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. The last of the Canadarms to fly in space, the SRMS flown aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-135 in July 2011, was shipped to NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston for engineering study and possible reuse on a future mission.

Based on the Canadarm1, the larger Canadarm2 is used for berthing the trusses, berthing the commercial vehicles, and inspecting the whole International Space Station.

=== Canadarm3 ===

The smaller Canadarm3 will be used for berthing the modules and inspecting the Lunar Gateway. In June 2024, the full contract for design and construction of the arm was awarded to MDA Space.

== In popular media ==
* On November 13, 2012, Google Canada displayed a doodle on its home search page to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the Canadarm&#x27;s first use in space.
* Starting November 7, 2013, Canadarm2 was included on the back of the Canadian five dollar note.

<doc id="739896" wikidata="Q257500" url="?curid=739896" title="Hilda of Whitby">
<text>Hilda of Whitby (or Hild; c. 614 – 680) was a saint of the early Church in Britain. She was the founder and first abbess of the monastery at Whitby which was chosen as the venue for the Synod of Whitby in 664. An important figure in the Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England, she was abbess in several convents and recognised for the wisdom that drew kings to her for advice.

The source of information about Hilda is the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; by Bede in 731, who was born approximately eight years before her death. He documented much of the Christian conversion of the English.

== Early life ==
According to Bede, Hilda was born in 614 into the Deiran royal household. She was the second daughter of Hereric, nephew of Edwin, King of Deira and his wife, Breguswīþ. When Hilda was still an infant, her father was poisoned while in exile at the court of the Brittonic king of Elmet in what is now West Yorkshire. In 616, Edwin defeated Æthelfrith, the son of Æthelric of Bernicia, in battle. He created the Kingdom of Northumbria and took its throne. Hilda was brought up at King Edwin&#x27;s court.

In 625, the widowed Edwin married the Christian princess Æthelburh of Kent, daughter of King Æthelberht of Kent and the Merovingian princess Bertha of Kent. As part of the marriage contract, Aethelburh was allowed to continue her Roman Christian worship and was accompanied to Northumbria with her chaplain, Paulinus of York, a Roman monk sent to England in 601 to assist Augustine of Canterbury. Augustine&#x27;s mission in England was based in Kent, and is referred to as the Gregorian mission after the pope who sent him. As queen, Æthelburh continued to practise her Christianity and no doubt influenced her husband&#x27;s thinking as her mother Bertha had influenced her father.

In 627, King Edwin was baptised on Easter Day, 12 April, along with his entire court, which included the 13-year-old Hilda, in a small wooden church hastily constructed for the occasion near the site of the present York Minster.

In 633, Northumbria was overrun by the neighbouring pagan King of Mercia, at which time King Edwin fell in battle. Paulinus accompanied Hilda and Queen Æthelburh and her companions to the Queen&#x27;s home in Kent. Queen Æthelburh founded a convent at Lyminge and it is assumed that Hilda remained with the Queen-Abbess.

Hilda&#x27;s elder sister, Hereswith, married Ethelric, brother of King Anna of East Anglia, who with all of his daughters became renowned for their Christian virtues. Later, Hereswith became a nun at Chelles Abbey in Gaul (modern France). Bede resumes Hilda&#x27;s story at a point when she was about to join her widowed sister at Chelles Abbey. At the age of 33, Hilda decided instead to answer the call of Bishop Aidan of Lindisfarne and returned to Northumbria to live as a nun.

==Abbess==

Hilda&#x27;s original convent is not known except that it was on the north bank of the River Wear. Here, with a few companions, she learned the traditions of Celtic monasticism, which Bishop Aidan brought from Iona. After a year Aidan appointed Hilda as the second abbess of Hartlepool Abbey. No trace remains of this abbey, but its monastic cemetery has been found near the present St Hilda&#x27;s Church, Hartlepool.

In 657 Hilda became the founding abbess of Whitby Abbey, then known as &quot;Streoneshalh&quot;; she remained there until her death. Archaeological evidence shows that her monastery was in the Celtic style, with its members living in small houses, each for two or three people. The tradition in double monasteries, such as Hartlepool and Whitby, was that men and women lived separately but worshipped together in church. The exact location and size of the church associated with this monastery is unknown.

Bede states that the original ideals of monasticism were maintained strictly in Hilda&#x27;s abbey. All property and goods were held in common; Christian virtues were exercised, especially peace and charity. Everyone had to study the Bible and do good works.

Five men from this monastery later became bishops. Two, John of Beverley, Bishop of Hexham and Wilfrid, Bishop of York, were canonized for their service to the Christian church at a critical period in its fight against paganism.

== Character ==

Bede describes Hilda as a woman of great energy, who was a skilled administrator and teacher. As a landowner she had many in her employ to care for sheep and cattle, farming, and woodcutting. She gained such a reputation for wisdom that kings and princes sought her advice. However, she also had a concern for ordinary folk such as Cædmon. He was a herder at the monastery, who was inspired in a dream to sing verses in praise of God. Hilda recognized his gift and encouraged him to develop it. Bede writes, &quot;All who knew her called her mother because of her outstanding devotion and grace&quot;.

== Synod of Whitby ==
The prestige of Whitby is reflected in the fact that King Oswiu of Northumberland chose Hilda&#x27;s monastery as the venue for the Synod of Whitby, the first synod of the Church in his kingdom. He invited churchmen from as far away as Wessex to attend the synod. Most of those present, including Hilda, accepted the King&#x27;s decision to adopt the method of calculating Easter currently used in Rome, establishing Roman practice as the norm in Northumbria. The monks from Lindisfarne, who would not accept this, withdrew to Iona, and later to Ireland.

== Illness and death ==
Hilda suffered from a fever for the last seven years of her life, but she continued to work until her death on 17 November 680 AD, at what was then the advanced age of sixty-six. In her last year she set up another monastery, fourteen miles from Whitby, at Hackness. She died after receiving viaticum, and her legend holds that at the moment of her death the bells of the monastery of Hackness tolled. A nun there named Begu claimed to have witnessed Hilda&#x27;s soul being borne to heaven by angels.

==Legends==

A local legend says that when sea birds fly over the abbey they dip their wings in honour of Saint Hilda. Another legend tells of a plague of snakes which Hilda turned to stone, supposedly explaining the presence of ammonite fossils on the shore. Local artisans carved snakes&#x27; heads onto ammonites, and sold these as relics, &quot;evidence&quot; of her miracle. 

In fact, the ammonite genus &quot;Hildoceras&quot; takes its scientific name from St. Hilda. The coat of arms of nearby Whitby includes three such &#x27;snakestones&#x27;, and depictions of ammonites appear in the shield of the University of Durham&#x27;s College of St Hild and St Bede. 

A carved ammonite stone is set into the wall by the entrance to the former chapel of St Hild&#x27;s College, Durham, which later became part of the College of St Hild and St Bede. The coat of arms of St. Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, includes a curled snake, and the ammonite is used by the college as a symbol.

==Veneration==
The veneration of Hilda from an early period is attested by the inclusion of her name in the calendar of Saint Willibrord, written at the beginning of the 8th century. According to one tradition, her relics were translated to Glastonbury by King Edmund; another tradition holds that Saint Edmund brought her relics to Gloucester.

In the Roman Catholic Church, the feast day of Saint Hilda is 17 November. In some parts of the Anglican Communion, her feast, a Lesser Festival, is on 18 November, while in some others, such as the Anglican Church of Australia, it is on 17 November. In the Church of England however, it is kept on 19 November. In the calendar approved for formerly Anglican Personal Ordinariate and Pastoral Provision parishes in the Roman Catholic Church, the feast day of Saint Hilda is celebrated on 23 June, together with those of Saint Ethelreda, Abbess of Ely (died 679), and Saint Mildred, Abbess of Minster-in-Thanet (died ca. 700).

==Patronage==
Hilda of Whitby is considered one of the patron saints of learning and culture, including poetry, due to her patronage of Cædmon. Saint Hilda is the patron saint of the National Cathedral School for Girls in Washington, D.C.

In addition, St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, established in 1893 for female students, remained with that status for more than 100 years, before turning co-educational when it was deemed that the percentage of women studying at Oxford had risen to near 50 per cent. The symbol of the college is the ammonite of St Hilda and during the centenary, 100 silver ammonites were created; now proudly owned by alumnae of the college in honour of St. Hilda&#x27;s achievements - and those of the first 100 years of female students at the college.

==Iconography==
Saint Hilda is generally depicted with a pastoral staff and carrying an abbey church. Often, there are ammonites at her feet.

== Legacy ==
===Whitby Abbey===

Hilda was succeeded as abbess by Eanflæd, widow of King Oswiu, and their daughter, Ælfflæd. From then onward we know nothing about the abbey at Whitby until it was destroyed by the Danish invaders in 867. After the Norman conquest that began in 1066 AD, monks from Evesham re-founded the abbey as a Benedictine house for men. Thus it continued until the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII in 1539.

There is said to be the wraith of St Hilda, who appears in the ruins wrapped in a shroud, and the bells of the abbey can be heard ringing under the water, where they sank with the ship taking them to London after the abbey was dismantled.

===Churches===
Two churches in Whitby (Roman Catholic and Anglican), have been dedicated under her patronage and another, in Bilsborrow, Lancashire.

Other Anglican Churches dedicated to St Hilda in Northern England include St Hilda&#x27;s Church, South Shields, one in the Cross Green area of Leeds, one in the Prestwich Area of Manchester, one in the Stretford Area of Manchester, and another in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. It was opened in September 1882. A orthodox Christian church dedicated to her is due to open in Halifax West Yorkshire in 2025.There is a statue of St Hilda in the nave, depicting her as the Mother of her Abbey at Whitby. She also appears in a stained glass window at the east end of the church. The church still is active and a sung mass is held there every Sunday. Several small streets in the immediate area are named after the church -- St Hilda&#x27;s Mount, St Hilda&#x27;s Road, among them.

===Religious communities===
A community of Anglican sisters, the Order of the Holy Paraclete was founded in 1915 at St Hilda&#x27;s Priory, on the western edge of Whitby town. More recently, the Community of St Aidan and St Hilda has been founded on Lindisfarne.

A group of Anglo-Catholic deaconesses founded in 1910 by Fr Frederick Burgess lived on the grounds of Christ Church, New Haven, Connecticut, in a house they called St Hilda&#x27;s House. The deaconesses of St Hilda&#x27;s House served the church, the children of the church school, and the poor and orphaned of New Haven until the early 1970s operating a free medicine clinic, soup kitchen and many other ministries. Today, St Hilda&#x27;s House-Episcopal Service Corps program at Christ Church New Haven has retained the name, and part of the legacy of the St Hilda&#x27;s deaconesses.

===Educational institutions===
St Hilda has become the patron of many schools and colleges all over the world. The College of St Hild and St Bede, Durham, St Hild&#x27;s Church of England School, Hartlepool, St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford and St Hilda&#x27;s Collegiate School, Dunedin are named after Saint Hilda. A stone from the 13th century ruins of Whitby Abbey where St Hilda founded the Monastery of Streoneshalh c. 657AD was donated to St Hilda&#x27;s College (University of Melbourne) by the Whitby Urban Council. This stone is located at the college entrance.

St. Hilda&#x27;s College, University of Toronto is the women&#x27;s college of University of Trinity College. Saint Hilda is honoured as co-patron (with Our Lady). Daily services are held in the Lady Chapel by Trinity&#x27;s Faculty of Divinity.

St Hilda&#x27;s Diocesan High School is an Anglican boarding school for girls in Brown&#x27;s Town, St. Ann, Jamaica, founded by Canon James Philip Hall, Rector of St. Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church in Brown&#x27;s Town 1906-07. St. Hilda&#x27;s College in Buenos Aires, Argentina was founded in 1912.

There are two schools situated in Australia in recognition of St. Hilda. They are both &#x27;St. Hilda&#x27;s Anglican School for Girls&#x27; which is an independent, girls&#x27; school in Southport, Queensland, and Mosman Park, Western Australia.

On the upper west side of Manhattan in New York City is St Hilda&#x27;s and St Hugh&#x27;s School, an independent Episcopal day school that opened its doors in 1950. The school is coeducational and includes toddlers to grade eight.

St Hilda is honoured in Singapore in the St. Hilda&#x27;s primary and secondary schools.

During the British Empire in India, Anglican missionaries built &quot;St Hilda Boarding School&quot; at Miri-Maka.

There are two St Hilda&#x27;s CofE Primary Schools in Manchester - one in Prestwich, one in Firswood. 

St Hilda&#x27;s School, Ootacamund, southern India was established by Church of England sisters in 1895.

===Fiction===
Hilda appears as a main character in the 1994 novel &quot;Absolution by Murder&quot;, the first book in Peter Tremayne&#x27;s Sister Fidelma mysteries.

Hilda appears as a main character in Melvyn Bragg&#x27;s 1996 novel, &quot;Credo&quot;.

The 2013 novel &quot;Hild&quot; and 2023 sequel &quot;Menewood&quot; by Nicola Griffith is based on the life of Hilda.

Jill Dalladay&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;The Abbess of Whitby&quot; combines historical record and fiction to imagine Hilda&#x27;s life before she became a nun.

Maureen Duffy&#x27;s play &quot;The Choice&quot; premiered at the Jermyn Street Theatre in 2018. This monologue sees Hilda recount two episodes of her life that are recorded by Bede: the &#x27;miracle&#x27; of the poet-cowherd Caedmon, and the role Hilda played in the transition from Irish to Roman Catholicism in the English church.

Vibeke Vasbo&#x27;s Danish novel &quot;Hildas sang&quot; (Gyldendal, 1991) was translated into English by Gaye Kynoch and published in 2018 as &quot;The Song of Hild&quot; by Sacristy Press.

<text>Katonah is the debut studio album by Boston area indie rock group Apollo Sunshine, released on October 7, 2003, on spinART Records.

==Background==
Jeremy Black and Sam Cohen met at Berklee College of Music in 1997 while attending a summer performance program, and then met Jesse Gallagher while attending the school full-time. Their musical tastes won the approval of professor Andy Edelstein, who taught classes Black and Cohen were in. Edelstein agreed to travel to Katonah, New York four days a week to produce the band&#x27;s first album, which was about to be recorded in a large shed on Black&#x27;s parents&#x27; property (featured in &quot;Before and After&quot; photos on the album&#x27;s cover and sleeve art) which was constructed in May and June 2002.

==Recording==
Recording commenced in June and wrapped in September, with post-production completing in June 2003 in Arlington, Massachusetts.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 she was nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album for &quot;Somewhere, Anywhere&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Sally Seltmann was born as Sally Mary Russell on 11 September 1975 and grew up in Sydney as the fourth of six children. As a child she had piano lessons learning classical music and later &quot;used to love singing in little jazz ensembles, &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s style songs&quot;. One of her inspirations was listening to Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s show tunes. In the early 1990s, she was the vocalist and founder of power pop group Lustre 4 alongside Lara Meyerratken on guitar. Other songwriters for Lustre 4 included Nicholas Devenish and Richard King. The band&#x27;s six-track extended play, &quot;Double Happiness&quot; had &quot;significant airplay&quot; on national radio station, Triple J, where the group&#x27;s music displayed &quot;[s]himmering guitars and songs of young love&quot;. While still a member of Lustre 4, Seltmann briefly replaced Liz Payne on guitar in indie rock band, Spdfgh, in mid-1995. She had co-written the track, &quot;You Made Me&quot; with Spdfgh&#x27;s Tania Bowers (aka Via Tania) for their album, &quot;Leave Me Like This&quot; (1995). Seltmann continued her work with Lustre 4 and was replaced in Spdfgh by Christina Hannaford.

In 1996, for her 21st birthday she shared a party with fellow indie singer, Ben Lee (ex-Noise Addict), who turned 18 on the same day (11 September): each had a special cake made by Meyerratken with icing as a painting of each individual. In 1997, after Lustre 4 disbanded, Seltmann moved to Melbourne where she attended an art school and worked as a photographer and waitress. In early 1999 she worked with Bowers again to compose a track for the latter&#x27;s debut solo EP, &quot;Sunday&quot;. Seltmann provided backing vocals on &quot;Electricity&quot; for Melbourne-based electronic band, The Avalanches&#x27; 1999 single – it was later on their debut album, &quot;Since I Left You&quot; (2000).

===New Buffalo years===
By 2000, Sally Seltmann had re-invented her musical style to create New Buffalo: she adopted a sound that replaced guitars with keyboards over smooth paced bass and soothing beats. In February 2000 Seltmann&#x27;s debut release as New Buffalo was the track &quot;16 Beats&quot;, which was available as an MP3 download via Ben Lee&#x27;s web site. Of her musical transition, Seltmann said &quot;I used to be in an all-girl punk band called Lustre 4. We were very, very loud... There were four of us [...] touring and having fun [...] Now I make dreamy pop songs [...] I like cutting up orchestral strings, but not plain-jane style&quot;. In 2001, Seltmann (as Sally Russell) won a Professional Development Award for &#x27;Pop/Dance Music&#x27; from the Australasian Performing Right Association. That year she signed with Modular Recordings and released her debut five-track EP, &quot;About Last Night&quot;, featuring &quot;16 Beats&quot;. The EP was produced by her fiance, Darren Seltmann of The Avalanches. MusicOMH&#x27;s Michael Hubbard noted &quot;[it] is a slow-paced affair of 1950s sci-fi movie effects, cut-back rhythm section ... what we end up with is something that&#x27;s not quite a soundtrack, not quite a pop tune and really not quite anything&quot;. The EP was also released in the United Kingdom through Heavenly Recordings, which saw New Buffalo invited to tour throughout the UK supporting Ed Harcourt in 2001.

In 2002, Seltmann recorded tracks in Los Angeles with Jake Davies, but after Heavenly withdrew their financial support, she decided to set up her own home studio, The Lonely Studio, in Melbourne. In 2003, Sally Russell had married Darren Seltmann and they lived in suburban Yarraville. There she wrote and arranged her debut album, &quot;The Last Beautiful Day&quot;, which was released in Australia on 20 September 2004 by Dot Dash. The album features special guest appearances by Beth Orton on backing vocals and Jim White of Dirty Three on drums. However, Seltmann performed the vast majority of instrumentation on her own as well as engineering, mixing, programming and producing the work. According to &quot;The Age&quot;″s reviewer, Anthony Carew, &quot;&quot;The Last Beautiful Day&quot; is the brilliant result. Largely composed of analogue organs, scratchy samples, and layers of Seltmann&#x27;s thin-yet-tender voice, it&#x27;s a profound piece of personal expression, a collection of lyrical pop-songs that&#x27;re a product of a single individual&quot;. On 23 August 2005 it was issued by Arts &amp; Crafts in North America. When touring in support of the album, Seltmann sometimes performed solo and sometimes New Buffalo included other musicians, John Lee, Simon Parker and Brendan Webb.

In July 2005 a self-titled EP was released featuring two new songs – a collaboration with composer Rae Howell, and a duet with Sweden&#x27;s Jens Lekman – plus re-mixes and re-worked versions of songs from the debut album. Seltmann provided a cover version of Crowded House&#x27;s &quot;Four Seasons in One Day&quot; for a tribute album, &quot;She Will Have Her Way&quot; (2005) – it was used in the 2011 promo of the Australian soap &quot;Neighbours&quot;. In late 2005 Seltmann toured Canada supporting her label mates, Feist and Broken Social Scene.
On 24 March 2007, Seltmann released her second LP, &quot;Somewhere, Anywhere&quot; in Australia, and to North American audiences on 28 August 2007. Mike Mineo of &quot;Obscure Sound&quot; felt &quot;Seltmann&#x27;s style is very consistent through each and every song. Laden with a light touch of keys, her weightless vocals provide as scenery to the accompanying piano and acoustic instruments surrounding her&quot;. Also in August, Seltmann was invited by Deborah Conway to take part in the Broad Festival project, which toured major Australian cities including performing at the Sydney Opera House. With Seltmann and Conway were Anne McCue, Jade Macrae and Abbe May – they performed their own and each other&#x27;s songs. In the same year, she toured as a support act for Air in Australia. She also toured in support of Paul Kelly on his Stolen Apples Tour of Australia. One of the last performances, on 20 September in Toowoomba, Queensland, was filmed and released on DVD as &quot;Live Apples: Stolen Apples Performed Live in its Entirety Plus 16 More Songs&quot;, in April 2008. The release includes Seltmann and Kelly performing a duet of a cover version of The Triffids&#x27; 1984 song, &quot;Raining Pleasure&quot;.

Seltmann co-wrote the song &quot;1234&quot; (originally called &quot;Sally&#x27;s Song&quot;) with Feist, which was released on Feist&#x27;s third solo album &quot;The Reminder&quot; (April 2007). The song was featured in a November 2007 iPod Nano commercial and transformed Feist&#x27;s career. By proxy, Seltmann&#x27;s New Buffalo project became better known as she was mentioned in a number of publications, including &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, which named her as an artist to watch in September 2007.

===&quot;Heart That&#x27;s Pounding&quot;===

In December 2009, Sally Seltmann announced the details of her third studio album, &quot;Heart That&#x27;s Pounding&quot;, which was released by Arts &amp; Crafts on 6 April 2010. The album was co-produced by Seltmann with film composer François Tétaz. It was the first album to be released under the Seltmann name, &quot;I just felt like I was ready to go by my real name and not hide behind New Buffalo&quot;. The lead single from the album, &quot;Harmony to My Heartbeat&quot;, was released through iTunes on 24 November 2009, and the accompanying music video directed by Antuong Nguyen of Moop Jaw followed on 15 December. In December 2009, the Seltmanns relocated to Sydney to reside.

In March 2010, Seltmann toured the US and Canada. On 14 August, Seltmann was guest programmer on &quot;rage&quot; with a playlist of over 50 songs. Also that month she formed an indie rock trio, Seeker Lover Keeper, with fellow Australians Sarah Blasko and Holly Throsby. They issued a self-titled album in June 2011, which peaked at number three on the ARIA Albums Chart. In November, Seltmann, Blasko and Throsby each provided a cover version of songs by Neil Finn and Tim Finn on the They Will Have Their Way Tour (see &quot;They Will Have Their Way&quot;) with various artists including Clare Bowditch, Lior, Paul Dempsey and Alexander Gow (of Oh Mercy) also appearing. Seltmann accompanied herself on a piano for her rendition of &quot;Four Seasons in One Day&quot;, later Seeker Lover Keeper performed &quot;Sinner&quot; from Neil&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Try Whistling This&quot;. In March 2012, Seltmann supported an Australian tour by Bon Iver.

=== &quot;Hey Daydreamer&quot; to &quot;The Letdown&quot; ===

Seltmann issued her fourth album (second under her own name), &quot;Hey Daydreamer&quot;, via Arts &amp; Crafts in March 2013. The Seltmanns had relocated to Los Angeles, after it was mostly written locally, she explained, &quot;I wrote most of the songs for &quot;Hey Daydreamer&quot; in Sydney, but writing in LA feels GOOD! There&#x27;s a lot of creative energy in the air in that city, which is one of the reasons why I live there now! A lot of positive energy, and a lot of writers and interesting people with ideas and courage.&quot; The album was recorded and co-produced with Darren.

AllMusic&#x27;s James Christopher Monger observed, &quot;[she] is first and foremost a confessional singer/songwriter, though one with a flair for pop artistry, and less fussy tracks like the lovely and heartfelt &quot;The Small Hotel,&quot; the bouncy, bucolic &quot;Holly Drive,&quot; and the stoic and superb closer &#x27;States and Spaces&quot;&#x27; drive that point home.&quot; In April 2014 she undertook an Australian east coast tour promoting the album&#x27;s local release in the previous month. It reached the ARIA Albums Chart top 100.

At the APRA Music Awards of 2016 Seltmann and Darren won Best Original Song Composed for the Screen for &quot;Dancing in the Darkness&quot;, which was used in &quot;The Letdown&quot; on ABC-TV. The couple had been approached by the comedy show&#x27;s creator Sarah Scheller, &quot;We knew that the show had some hilarious moments, but also some introspective moments where the main character feels isolated and is struggling with the changes of being a new mum. &quot;Dancing in the Darkness&quot; was used in one of these more sensitive scenes, and we felt so happy with how the music worked with the visuals and performances.&quot;

=== &quot;Lovesome&quot; ===

In April 2018, Allen &amp; Unwin published Seltmann&#x27;s debut novel Lovesome. Set in 1995 in Sydney&#x27;s Balmain, Lovesome tells the story of twenty one year old artist and waitress Joni Johnson, and her search for love. Librarian&#x27;s Choice included Lovesome in their Top 10 Books We Love of May 2018, and Seltmann appeared at The Melbourne Writers Festival, Brisbane Writers Festival and Perth Writers Week.

==Personal life==

In 2003, Sally Russell married Darren Seltmann, of The Avalanches. In late 2008, the couple had a daughter. As of December 2009, the family resides in Sydney.

Her older brother, Luke Russell, is a philosophy lecturer at Sydney University, where he completed his PhD, in 2002. Luke also has a side career in pop rock; in 2007, he issued his debut album, &quot;Kiss That Lasted All Weekend&quot;, on Half A Cow Records.

<text>Gāndhārī was an Indo-Aryan Prakrit language found mainly in texts dated between the 3rd century BCE and 4th century CE in the region of Gandhāra, located in the northwestern Indian subcontinent. The language was heavily used by the former Buddhist cultures of Central Asia and has been found as far away as eastern China, in inscriptions at Luoyang and Anyang.

Gandhari served as an official language of the Kushan Empire and various central Asian kingdoms, including Khotan and Shanshan. It appears on coins, inscriptions and texts, notably the Gandhāran Buddhist texts. It is notable among the Prakrits for having some archaic phonology, for its relative isolation and independence, for being partially within the influence of the ancient Near East and Mediterranean and for its use of the Kharoṣṭhī script, compared to Brahmic scripts used by other Prakrits.

Gāndhārī is an early Middle Indo-Aryan language – a Prakrit – with unique features that distinguish it from all other known Prakrits. Phonetically, it maintained all three Old Indo-Aryan sibilants – s, ś and ṣ – as distinct sounds where they fell together as [s] in other Prakrits, a change that is considered one of the earliest Middle Indo-Aryan shifts. Gāndhārī also preserves certain Old Indo-Aryan consonant clusters, mostly those involving v and r. In addition, intervocalic Old Indo-Aryan th and dh are written early on with a special letter (noted by scholars as an underlined s, [s]), which later is used interchangeably with s, suggesting an early change to a sound, likely the voiced dental fricative ð, and a later shift to z and then a plain s.

The Middle Prakrits typically weakened th to dh, which later shifted to h. Kharoṣṭhī does not render the distinction between short and long vowels, so the details of that feature are not known.

Linguistic evidence links some groups of the Dardic languages with Gandhari. The Kohistani languages, now all being displaced from their original homelands, were once more widespread in the region and most likely descend from the ancient dialects of the region of Gandhara. The last to disappear was Tirahi, still spoken some years ago in a few villages in the vicinity of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan, by descendants of migrants expelled from Tirah by the Afridi Pashtuns in the 19th century. Georg Morgenstierne claimed that Tirahi is &quot;probably the remnant of a dialect group extending from Tirah through the Peshawar district into Swat and Dir&quot;. Nowadays, it must be entirely extinct and the region is now dominated by Iranian languages brought in by later immigrations, such as Pashto. Among the modern day Indo-Aryan languages still spoken today, Torwali shows the closest linguistic affinity possible to &quot;Niya&quot;, a dialect of Gāndhārī.

== Rediscovery and history ==
Initial identification of a distinct language occurred through study of one of the Buddhist āgamas, the &quot;Dīrghāgama&quot;, which had been translated into Chinese by Buddhayaśas () and Zhu Fonian ().

Since this time, a consensus has grown in scholarship which sees the first wave of Buddhist missionary work as associated with Gāndhārī and the Kharoṣṭhī script, and tentatively with the Dharmaguptaka sect.

Available evidence also indicates that the first Buddhist missions to Khotan were carried out by the Dharmaguptaka sect, and used a Kharoṣṭhī-written Gāndhārī.
However, there is evidence that other sects and traditions of Buddhism also used Gāndhārī, and evidence that the Dharmaguptaka sect also used Sanskrit at times.

Starting in the first century of the common era, there was a large trend toward a type of Gāndhārī which was heavily Sanskritized.

==Phonology==
In general terms, Gāndhārī is a Middle Prakrit, a term for middle-stage Middle Indo-Aryan languages. It only begins to show the characteristics of the Late Prakrits in the 1st century of the Common Era. The Middle Prakrit phonetic features are the weakening of intervocalic consonants: degemination and voicing, such as the shift of OIA *&quot;k&quot; to &quot;g&quot;. The most rapid loss was the dentals, which started to disappear completely even before the late period as with *&quot;t&quot; &gt; &quot;∅&quot; as in *&quot;pitar&quot; &gt; &quot;piu&quot;; in contrast, retroflex consonants were never lost. There is also evidence of the loss of a distinction between aspirates and plain stops as well, which is unusual in the Indo-Aryan languages.

In Central Asian Gāndhārī, there is often confusion in writing nasals with homorganic stops; it is unclear if this might represent assimilation of the stop or the appearance of prenasalized consonants to the phonetic inventory.

== Grammar ==
Gāndhārī grammar is difficult to analyse; endings were eroded not only by the loss of final consonants and cluster simplification of all Prakrits but also by the apparent weakening of final vowels &quot;&#x27;to the point that they were no longer differentiated&#x27;&quot;. Nonetheless, there was still at least a rudimentary system of grammatical case. Verbal forms are highly restricted in usage due to the primary usage of longer texts to translations of religious documents and the narrative nature of the sutras but seem to parallel changes in other Prakrits.

== Lexicon ==
The lexicon of Gāndhārī is also limited by its textual usage; it is still possible to determine unusual forms, such as Gāndhārī forms that show commonalities with forms in modern Indo-Aryan languages of the area, notably some groups of the Dardic languages. An example is the word for sister, which is a descendant of Old Indo-Aryan &quot;svasṛ-&quot; as in the Dardic languages, whereas all the Indo-Aryan languages have replaced that term with reflexes of &quot;bhaginī&quot;.

==Buddhist manuscripts in Gāndhāri==
Until 1994, the only Gāndhāri manuscript available to the scholars was a birch bark manuscript of a Buddhist text, the &quot;Dharmapāda&quot;, discovered at Kohmāri Mazār near Hotan in Xinjiang in 1893 CE. From 1994 on, a large number of fragmentary manuscripts of Buddhist texts, seventy-seven altogether, were discovered in eastern Afghanistan and Western Pakistan. These include:

* 29 fragments of birch-bark scrolls of British Library collection consisting of parts of the &quot;Dharmapada&quot;, &quot;Anavatapta Gāthā&quot;, the &quot;Rhinoceros Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Sangitiparyaya&quot; and a collection of sutras from the &quot;Ekottara Āgama&quot;.
* 129 fragments of palm leaf folios of Schøyen Collection, 27 fragments of palm-leaf folios of Hirayama collection and 18 fragments of palm leaf folios of Hayashidera collection consisting of the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Bhadrakalpikā Sūtra&quot;.
* 24 birch-bark scrolls of Senior collection consists of mostly different sutras and the &quot;Anavatapta Gāthā&quot;.
* 8 fragments of a single birch-bark scroll and 2 small fragments of another scroll of University of Washington collection consisting of probably an Abhidharma text or other scholastic commentaries.

==Translations from Gāndhāri==
Mahayana Buddhist Pure Land sūtras were brought from Gandhāra to China as early as 147 CE, when the Kushan monk Lokakṣema began translating the first Buddhist sutras into Chinese. The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from Gāndhārī. It is also known that manuscripts in the Kharoṣṭhī script existed in China during this period.

<doc id="739908" wikidata="Q1849082" url="?curid=739908" title="Gandhari (Mahabharata)">
<text>Gandhari (, ) is a prominent figure in the Hindu epic the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. She is the daughter of King Subala, the ruler of Gandhara, and becomes the wife of Dhritarashtra, the blind king of Kuru Kingdom. In a remarkable act of solidarity, Gandhari blindfolds herself for life upon learning of her husband’s blindness, choosing to share his condition. Blessed by the god Shiva and the sage Vyasa, she bears one hundred sons through miraculous means, collectively known as the Kauravas, with her eldest, Duryodhana, becoming a key antagonist in the epic. Besides the hundred sons, she also has a daughter, Dushala. Although Gandhari possesses many virtues, she is unable to steer her sons away from their wrongdoings. The rivalry between the Kauravas and their cousins, the Pandavas, culminates in the devastating Kurukshetra war, which results in the destruction of the Kuru dynasty.

After the war, she becomes the voice of women who suffer due to the devastation caused by the conflict. While she refrains from cursing the Pandavas, recognising the righteousness of their victory, her grief leads her to curse Krishna—the avatara of the god Vishnu—holding him accountable for the war’s destruction and foretelling the downfall of his Yadava dynasty. In the aftermath, Gandhari retreats to the forest with Dhritarashtra and Kunti, where she spends her final days in austerity. Her life ends in a forest fire, but her legacy endures as a symbol of maternal love, devotion, sacrifice, and the profound cost of war.

==Epithets==
In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Gāndhārī&quot; is referred to by various names, including:

* Gāndhārarājaduhitā — &#x27;daughter of the King of Gāndhāra&#x27;
* Saubaleyī, Subalajā, Subalāputrī, and Subalātmajā — &#x27;daughter of Subala&#x27;

== Literary background ==
Gandhari is a character of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, one of the Sanskrit epics from the Indian subcontinent. The work is written in Classical Sanskrit and is a composite work of revisions, editing and interpolations over many centuries. The oldest parts in the surviving version of the text may date to near 400 BCE.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscripts exist in numerous versions, wherein the specifics and details of major characters and episodes vary, often significantly. Except for the sections containing the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; which is remarkably consistent between the numerous manuscripts, the rest of the epic exists in many versions. The differences between the Northern and Southern recensions are particularly significant, with the Southern manuscripts more profuse and longer. Scholars have attempted to construct a critical edition, relying mostly on a study of the &quot;Bombay&quot; edition, the &quot;Poona&quot; edition, the &quot;Calcutta&quot; edition and the &quot;south Indian&quot; editions of the manuscripts. The most accepted version is one prepared by scholars led by Vishnu Sukthankar at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, preserved at Kyoto University, Cambridge University and various Indian universities.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; centres on the intense rivalry between the groups of brothers—five Pandavas and the hundred Kauravas, culminating in the epic Kurukshetra War, which forms the narrative&#x27;s core. A significant portion of the text is devoted to detailing the battles fought between the warriors of both sides during this conflict. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; is structured into eighteen parvas or &#x27;books&#x27;, starting with the &quot;Adi Parva&quot;, in which Gandhari is introduced.

== Biography ==
Gandhari is introduced in the &quot;Adi Parva&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as the daughter of King Subala, the ruler of the Gandhara kingdom and a descendant of Turvasu (son of Yayati) of the Lunar Dynasty. This region spanned from the Sindhu River to Kabul in Afghanistan. Gandhari is regarded as an incarnation of a goddess named Mati (&#x27;intellect&#x27;). She had several brothers, but she shared a particularly close bond with Shakuni.

===Early life and marriage===
The &quot;Adi Parva&quot; describes Gandhari as a devout worshipper of the god Shiva from a young age. Pleased by her unwavering devotion, Shiva grants her a boon, promising that she will bear one hundred sons. After becoming aware of the divine boon bestowed upon Gandhari, Bhishma, the patriarch of the Kuru dynasty, proposes her marriage to Dhritarashtra, his eldest nephew who is born blind. Subala initially hesitates due to Dhritarashtra&#x27;s blindness but later agrees to the marriage, prioritizing the prestige of an alliance with the Kuru dynasty. Gandhari’s brother, Shakuni, accompanies her to the capital of Kuru Kingdom, Hastinapura, where the marriage is solemnized. On marrying Dhritarashtra, she blindfolds herself with a silk shawl, choosing to live without sight for the rest of her life. Gandhari is welcomed by the Kuru elders. Shakuni returns to his kingdom, but frequently visits Gandhari to help her and her children.

Gandhari&#x27;s husband, Dhritarashtra, is denied the throne due to his blindness, despite being the eldest son. The throne is instead given to his younger brother, Pandu, but he later renounces the kingdom. As a result of these events, Dhritarashtra is crowned King of Kuru kingdom, and Gandhari becomes queen.

=== Pregnancy and birth of her children ===
Gandhari&#x27;s children were born in a miraculous manner. According to the &quot;Adi Parva&quot;, once when the sage Vyasa visits Hastinapura, Gandhari serves him with great respect and care. Impressed by her hospitality, Vyasa blesses her, reaffirming Shiva’s boon. Shortly after, Gandhari conceives, but her pregnancy lasts two years without delivery. During this time, Kunti, the wife of Pandu, gives birth to her first son, Yudhishthira. Overwhelmed by frustration and envy upon hearing this, Gandhari strikes her womb, but instead of a child, a &quot;hard mass of flesh&quot; like an &quot;iron ball&quot; emerges from it. When the Kuru elders were about to discard the mass of flesh, Vyasa intervenes and instructs that the lump be divided into one hundred pieces and placed in jars of ghee for incubation. At Gandhari’s request, an additional piece is prepared to produce a daughter, resulting in 101 jars. In due time, the jars yield one hundred sons collectively referred to as the Kauravas, and a daughter named Dushala. During Gandhari&#x27;s prolonged pregnancy, Dhritarashtra had fathered another son, Yuyutsu, through a maidservant of Gandhari in fear of not having a child.

===Gandhari as queen===

As queen in the Kuru court, Gandhari witnesses many pivotal events leading to the Kurukshetra War, the central plot of the epic. Although she remains largely silent, Gandhari exerts moral influence in critical moments. For instance, during the infamous dicing match narrated in the &quot;Sabha Parva&quot;, she intervenes after Draupadi&#x27;s attempted disrobing, compelling Dhritarashtra to grant Draupadi a boon that ultimately secures the freedom of the Pandavas.

Despite her quiet demeanor, Gandhari does not shy away from speaking against injustice. She advises her son, Duryodhana, against his warmongering and criticizes Dhritarashtra for failing to curb their son’s reckless ambitions. Her attempts to avert the war, however, prove futile. Gandhari attended the discussions and negotiations that preceded the war, hoping for peace, as mentioned in the &quot;Udyoga Parva&quot;.

===Kurukshetra war===
Gandhari remains a notable presence throughout Sanjaya’s recounting of the war to Dhritrarashtra, as evidenced by several clear references to her and the other women of the Kuru court. All of Gandhari&#x27;s sons were killed in the war against their cousins, the Pandavas, at Kurukshetra, specifically at the hands of the second Pandava, Bhima. It is believed that during this period, Gandhari makes a single purposeful exception to her blindfolded state, when she removes her blindfold to shield her eldest son Duryodhana. She poured all her &quot;yogic&quot; power accumulated by her sacrifice of sight and devotion into her son&#x27;s body in one glance, rendering Duryodhana&#x27;s entire body, except his loins, as strong as a thunderbolt. Krishna, the counsellor of the Pandavas, had foiled Gandhari&#x27;s plan to make her son invincible by asking Duryodhana to cover up his loins before meeting his mother. On their decisive encounter on the eighteenth day of the war, Bhima smashed Duryodhana&#x27;s thighs, a move both literally and figuratively below the belt. Despite its popularity the story is not mentioned in the original version of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. As per the &quot;Shalya Parva&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Duryodhana, while fighting against Bhima, displayed his superior mace skills, due to which Bhima could not defeat him and had to break rules to kill him.

Gandhari assumes the central role in the &quot;Stri Parva&quot; (The Book of Women), the eleventh book of the epic, which portrays the aftermath of the Kurukshetra War. After winning the war, the Pandavas visit Gandhari to seek her blessings. By this time, Gandhari has lost all her sons, including Duryodhana, and is overwhelmed with grief and anger. As the Pandavas stand before her, she considers cursing them. However, Vyasa reminds her of her earlier declaration that righteousness would prevail in the war. Gandhari accepts this truth and acknowledges that the destruction of her sons and the Kuru dynasty is the result of the misdeeds of Duryodhana, Shakuni, Karna, and Dussasana. Calming herself, she refrains from cursing the Pandavas, but when Yudhishthira bows at Gandhari’s feet, her grief and wrath manifests physically. Tears fall from her eyes onto his toenails, causing them to burn black. Gandhari later accepts them.

The &quot;Stri Parva&quot; further narrates that Gandhari visits the battlefield of Kurukshetra, accompanied by Krishna and other family members. Gandhari emerges as a central voice among the bereaved women, expressing her sorrow and outrage over the destruction wrought by the war. Granted divine vision to see through her blindfold, Gandhari witnesses the mourning of the Kuru women on the battlefield, their cries and lamentations contrasting sharply with the earlier songs of praise for the fallen warriors. Seeing the vast destruction and the lifeless bodies of the Kaurava warriors including her sons, Gandhari, despite her earlier reverence for Krishna, holds him accountable for the destruction, accusing him of failing to prevent the war despite his divine powers. In a moment of profound emotional anguish, she curses Krishna, foretelling that thirty-six years from then, he will witness the destruction of his Yadava dynasty and die a lonely death, killed by trickery. This curse is pivotal in leading to the eventual downfall of Krishna’s lineage and his departure from the mortal world.

=== Later life and death ===
The &quot;Ashramavasika Parva&quot; recounts that fifteen years after the war, Gandhari, along with Dhritarashtra, Kunti, her brother-in-law Vidura, and aid Sanjaya, retires to the forest near the ashram of Shatayupa, on the banks of the Ganga. The Pandavas, deeply affected by the separation, visit them after six years. At Gandhari and Kunti’s request, Vyasa uses his yogic powers to enable them to briefly see the spirits of their deceased relatives. Shortly afterward, a wildfire engulfs the forest, consuming Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, and Kunti.

The &quot;Svargarohana Parva&quot; mentions that Yudhishthira performs the final rites for those who perish in the forest fire. After their deaths, the souls of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari ascend to Kuberaloka, the celestial realm associated with wealth and contentment.

==Portrayal in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;==
The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; attributes high moral standards to Gandhari. Although her sons are portrayed as villains she repeatedly exhorted her sons to follow dharma and make peace with the Pandavas. Famously, when Duryodhana would ask for her blessing of victory during the Kurukshetra war, Gandhari would only say &quot;may victory find the side of righteousness&quot;. Gandhari&#x27;s major flaw was her love for her sons, especially her firstborn Duryodhana, which often blinded her to his menacing character.

Gandhari fostered a sisterly relationship with Kunti, often sharing her joy, anguish and anger with her. There is little information about her relationship with the Pandavas but it is hinted that she felt deep sympathy for their wife Draupadi. Throughout the happenings of the epic, Gandhari is portrayed to be composed and calm; however after losing all her sons, she is distraught and furious and blames Krishna for not using his divine powers to stop the war from happening.

==Legacy==
Gandhari has been adapted as a major character in the Sanskrit play Urubhanga by Bhasa.
In Hebbya village, Nanjangud, Mysore, India, there is a temple called Gāndhārī temple dedicated to her. This temple honours her devotion and loyalty as she epitomized the goodness of a mother and a loving wife. The foundation stone of the temple was laid on June 19, 2008.

Rabindranath Tagore wrote a Bengali poetic play about her, named &quot;Gandharir Abedon&quot; (Bangla: গান্ধারীর আবেদন, Translation: Supplication of Gandhari). Gandhari, her husband Dhritarashtra and their son Duryodhana are central characters in the play. Aditi Banerjee wrote a novel named &quot;The Curse of Gandhari&quot;, which depicts the story of the Mahabharata through the perspective of Gandhari.

<doc id="739914" wikidata="Q1132815" url="?curid=739914" title="Timing belt (camshaft)">
<text>In a piston engine, either a timing belt (also called a &quot;cambelt&quot;) or timing chain or set of timing gears is a perishable component used to synchronize the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft. This synchronisation ensures that the engine&#x27;s valves open and close at the correct times in relation to the position of the pistons.

== Design ==
In most piston engines, the camshaft(s) are mechanically connected to the crankshaft. The crankshaft drives the camshaft (via a timing belt, timing chain or gears), which in turn actuates the intake and exhaust valves. These valves allow the engine to inhale air (or an air/fuel mixture) and exhale the exhaust gasses.

The most common devices to transfer the drive are toothed rubber belts, metal timing chains or a set of gears. The teeth of the belt/chain/gears mesh with both the crankshaft and camshaft(s), thereby synchronising their motion.

In many older overhead valve engines, the camshaft is located in the block near the crankshaft, therefore a simple gear system is often used to drive the camshaft. Overhead camshaft engines mostly use timing belts or timing chains, since these are better suited to transferring drive over larger distances. Timing belts were common on mass-production cars until the 1970s and 1980s, however since the 1990s timing chains have become more common due to the replacement intervals required when using timing belts.

== Toothed rubber belts ==

The phrase &quot;timing belt&quot; usually refers to a rubber toothed belt. The advantages of timing belts are typically a lower cost, reduced friction losses, less noise and that belts traditionally do not require lubrication. The main disadvantage is that belts wear over time, therefore belt replacement is recommended at specific intervals. Replacement of the engine&#x27;s water pump at the same time is often recommended, since the water pump is also subject to wear and easily accessed during the replacement of the timing belt.

Timing belts are typically located in front of the engine and are often behind a cover for protection against dust and debris. However a few engines since 2008 have used &quot;wet timing belts&quot;, whereby the belt is lubricated by engine oil to reduce friction losses by 30% and thus reduce fuel consumption by 1%. In some engine designs the timing belt may also be used to drive other components, such as the water pump and oil pump.

=== Construction ===
A timing belt is typically made from rubber, although some belts are instead made from polyurethane or neoprene. The structure of the belt is reinforced with corded fibres (acting as tension members) and the toothed surface is reinforced with a fabric covering.

Rubber degrades with higher temperatures, and with contact with motor oil. Thus the life expectancy of a timing belt is lowered in hot or leaky engines. Also, the life of the reinforcing cords is also affected by water and antifreeze, so it is important that belt that can be exposed to water is able to drain the water away quickly.

Older belts have trapezoid shaped teeth leading to high rates of tooth wear. Newer manufacturing techniques allow for curved teeth that are quieter and last longer.

Manufacturer-specification timing belts may stretch at high rpm, retarding the cam and therefore the ignition. Stronger aftermarket belts will not stretch and the timing is preserved. When designing the timing belt, a wider belt increases its strength however a narrower belt reduces weight and friction.

The usual failure modes of timing belts are either stripped teeth (which leaves a smooth section of belt where the drive cog will slip) or delamination and unraveling of the fiber cores. Breakage of the belt, because of the nature of the high tensile fibers, is uncommon. Often overlooked, debris and dirt that mix with oil and grease can slowly wear at the belt and materials advancing the wear process, causing premature belt failure.

=== History ===
Toothed belts were invented in the early 1940s, for use in textile mills. The first known automobile engine to use a timing belt was the American 1954 Devin-Panhard racing car, used an engine converted from pushrods to overhead camshafts through the use of a toothed belt made by the Gilmer Company. This car won the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) National Championship in 1956.

The 1962 Glas 1004 was the first mass-produced vehicle to use a timing belt. The 1966 Pontiac &quot;OHC Six&quot; engine was the first US mass-produced vehicle to use a timing belt, while the 1966 Fiat Twin Cam engine was the first mass-produced engine to use a timing belt with twin camshafts. Carmakers began to adopt timing belts in the 1970s and compared to timing chains are less expensive, smaller, lighter, quieter, isolate harmonics of the crankshaft from the valve train, require less power than chains and can potentially function without lubrication. Timing belts are usually made of Neoprene or HNBR.

== Timing chains ==

Metal timing chains have become more widespread in car engines produced since the 1990s, due to the lack of the regular maintenance task of replacing a rubber timing belt. While the chains themselves are subject to minimal wear, lubrication of the chain or failure of the tensioner and chain guides can cause maintenance issues. By contrast to rubber-based timing belts which give no indication of snapping while one is driving, early symptoms of a timing chain system becoming worn exist, and these include a rattling noise from the front of the engine.

Most pushrod engines, where the crankshaft and camshaft are very close together, use a short chain drive rather than a direct gear drive. This is because gear drives suffer from frequent torque reversal as the cam profiles &quot;kick back&quot; against the drive from the crank, leading to excessive noise and wear.

== Timing gears ==
Timing gears are used in various overhead valve engines, due to the close proximity of the camshaft to the crankshaft.

Fiber or nylon covered gears, with more resilience, are often used instead of steel gears where direct drive is used. However, commercial engines and aircraft engines use steel gears only, as the other materials can fail suddenly and without warning.

== Effects of failure ==
Failure of the timing system will prevent an engine from running. Many modern cars use interference engines, which can suffer catastrophic damage in the event of timing system failure, since the loss of synchronization between the crankshaft and the camshaft will cause the valves to collide with the pistons.

Warning signs that a timing chain needs to be replaced include:
* Later model VVT applications will generate engine codes and check engine lights prior to engine rattle
* Older, pre-VVT applications will generate engine rattle

Aside from the belt/chain itself, also common is a failure of the tensioner, and/or the various gear and idler bearings, causing the belt/chain to derail. Furthermore, in engines where the timing belt drives the water pump, failure of the water pump can cause the pump to seize, which can break the timing belt or chain. For this reason, timing belts and chains are often sold as part of a kit with the water pump, tensioner, and idler pulleys so that these parts can be replaced to prevent timing belt or chain failure due to failure of these parts.

<text>The Bureau International des Containers et du Transport Intermodal (originally ) (BIC) oversees standards for intermodal containers (commonly referred to as shipping containers).

The goal of the organization is to promote cooperation among corporations, governments and independent organizations relating to intermodal freight transport, the process of containerization, and the transport and handling of intermodal shipping containers.

== History ==
BIC was originally established in 1933 under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce. The Bureau suspended its operations during World War II, with resumption in 1948.

In June 1933, the Bureau decided on obligatory parameters for containers used in international transport in Europe. Containers handled by means of lifting gear, such as cranes, overhead conveyors, etc. for traveling elevators (group I containers), constructed after July 1, 1933. Obligatory Regulations: 
* Clause 1.—Containers are, as regards form, either of the closed or the open type, and, as regards capacity, either of the heavy or the light type. 
* Clause 2.—The loading capacity of containers must be such that their total weight (load, plus tare) is: 5 metric tons for containers of the heavy type; 2.5 metric tons for containers of the light type; a tolerance of 5 percent excess on the total weight is allowable under the same conditions as for wagon loads.


In April 1935 BIC established second standard for European containers:
===1951 Zürich conference and UIC standard 590: &quot;Pa-behälter&quot;===
From 14–23 April 1951, at Zürich Tiefenbrunnen, the Swiss Transportation Association, under auspices of the Bureau International des Containers (BIC), held a comprehensive international exhibition of container systems, aimed to select the best standards for Western Europe. Represented were France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, and Sweden; with USA observers. The International Union of Railways, UIC, then standardised a container system for Western Europe called &#x27;Porteur-aménagé&#x27;, or &quot;Pa-Behälter&quot; / &quot;Pa-containers&quot; (UIC 590), based on the Netherlands&#x27; systems of waste disposal containers and&quot; &#x27;Laadkisten&#x27; &quot;(&quot;loading crates&quot;) for consumer goods. Used since 1934, these were at first in size, with a maximum gross weight of . Fitted with rollers underneath, these units could be loaded and unloaded by drivers of trucks equipped with a winch and telescoping ramps – without any other handling equipment. This enabled the practice of dropping and picking-up of such containers&quot; &#x27;Von Haus zu Haus&#x27; &quot;(&quot;door-to-door&quot;). 

UIC 590 became the first pan-European standard after World War II. Its system was adopted in Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, Switzerland and Sweden. Using the previously BIC-defined sizes, containers of were a practical size to be transported &quot;lengthwise&quot; on most countries&#x27; trucks, and &quot;transversely&quot; on railcars.

===ISO containers and BIC registration – ISO 6346===
Once the larger containers of the ISO-design were gradually popularized, the &quot;Pa-Behälter&quot; system was supplanted, and withdrawn from use by the railways. From the 1970s on, the Pa-system was reutilized in several European countries for transport of waste disposal by trucks, especially open skips for demolition / construction waste.

The Bureau International des Containers (BIC) was elected by the International Standardization Organization (ISO) in the late 1960s as the single registrar office in charge of the registration and protection of the container&#x27;s owners and operator&#x27;s identification code. These &quot;BIC codes&quot; were later standardised under ISO 6346. They ensure a unique code-number for every shipping container in the world. They started with the European&quot; &#x27;Pa-container&#x27; &quot;system, and they must still be registered with BIC.

The Customs Convention on Containers (CCC-1972) in a recent amendment, enforced since 2008, also makes reference to the ISO 6346 standard, and code registration with BIC, to allow the free circulation of containers worldwide.

<text>Fauchon is a French gourmet food and delicatessen company that was founded in 1886 in Paris, France. Fauchon is considered a major reference in contemporary French gourmet foods, and it had 81 outlets in operation around the world as of 2019.

== History ==
=== Origins from 1886 until 1952 ===
The founder of the Fauchon brand, Auguste Fauchon, was born in Ellon, Calvados, in 1856. He moved to Paris in 1880, where he began to work as a street vendor, moving on to become a wine and spirits merchant. In 1886, at the age of 30, he opened a fine foods outlet on Place de la Madeleine in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.
The quality of the products made by Fauchon and its numerous approved suppliers quickly made it well-known internationally, and it came to symbolise French-style luxury. In 1968, French radicals chose to raid Fauchon and distribute foie gras to the poor.
During the Second World War, restrictions and rationing made business difficult for the company. Auguste Fauchon died in 1945, and his children sold the company in 1952.

===From 1952 to 1998: exploring new opportunities===
In 1952, Joseph Pilosoff, the former owner of &quot;Chocolat Poulain&quot;, &quot;Ciseaux d&#x27;argent&quot; in Saint-Cloud and &quot;Aux 100000 chemises&quot; in Paris, took over Fauchon and built up a partnership with Air France. He also expanded the name abroad, opening new Fauchon outlets including in Japan at Takashimaya department stores in 1972. 
When Joseph Pilosoff died in 1981, his daughter took over at the head of the company. However, she too died soon thereafter, in December 1985, in a fire on the company premises.

In 1986, Joseph Pilosoff&#x27;s granddaughter, Martine, and her husband, Philippe Prémat, became the owners of Fauchon.
Martine Prémat&#x27;s management proved difficult. Turnover had been flat since the beginning of the decade at around 250 million French francs (some €38 million), with losses of FF5 million in 1991, FF4.7 million in 1993 and FF11.9 million in 1996, and debt standing at FF73 million (€11 million) and a negative net equity of FF4.9 million.

The company strategy to sell its products in mass-market superstore chains such as Carrefour and Auchan, was sharply criticised, and the management was reproached with running the risk of spoiling the company&#x27;s image, making it commonplace, and was also criticised for making management errors.

Despite attempts to expand the group in the 1990s by opening shops in Geneva and Saudi Arabia – only to close them a few years later – or by sponsoring the Paris Dakar rally, Martine Prémat finally sold the company to Laurent Adamowicz for FF240 million (€36.6 million) in March 1998, including the freehold of the buildings on Place de la Madeleine, sold the following year.

===From 1998 to 2003: wide expansion of activities===
Laurent Adamowicz, a former investment banker and business school graduate with experience in the field of luxury products, positioned the brand on the gourmet foods market. He launched new products and ad campaigns, renovated points of sale, withdrew the brand from mass-market outlets and renovated the historical Tea Salon on Place de la Madeleine. He started a new partnership with Air France, and promoted young pastry chefs, like Pierre Hermé, Sébastien Godard, Christophe Adam, Dominique Ansel.

In 2000, Fauchon became a growing and profitable company again, with 90 million Euros ($135 million) in sales and 5 million ($7.5 million) in EBIT for 2002. Fauchon opened new stores in Japan, in South Korea, Taiwan, the Middle East, Europe, and finally in the United States where it never had a store before, investing FF60 million (€9.2 million) in five years in the US market, with a diversified investor group that included Michel Deroy and Jean-Francois Toulouse, former owners and managers of Dock de France supermarkets, the investment fund Matignon Investissements et Gestion, the publicly listed UK fund Intermediate Capital Group, and Barclays Capital Development France. Barclays Private Equity France, a subsidiary of the Barclays plc Group, backed Laurent Adamowicz in his takeover of Fauchon to participate in its development in France and abroad.

In France, the acquisition of Flo Prestige delicatessens for €39 million increased the number of outlets in Paris by 12 stores. In 2003, the Fauchon network included 650 franchises, with 16 of its own shops, three in New York and 13 in Paris.

The acquisition of the Flo outlets in Paris in 2002 and the opening of three shops in New York led to a sharp rise in income between 1998 and 2004, but a decline in Fauchon&#x27;s net profits. In the spring and summer of 2003, Fauchon, heavily in debt, was affected by the collapse of the tourism market with the combination of several events: the Iraq War and the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in April 2003, followed in May 2003 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus epidemic, and then the unprecedented heat wave in Europe that hit France particularly hard with over 15,000 dead in August 2003.

In January 2004, Laurent Adamowicz sold his interest in the company and left his CEO&#x27;s office to Michel Ducros, one of the sons of Gilbert Ducros (1928–2007), the founder of the Ducros spice business.

===Since 2004===

From 2004 onwards, Michel Ducros bought out most of the other shareholders, private and institutional, and will acquire between 2005 and 2009 all of the shares held by the Barclays Group, the 36% stake owned by La Compagnie du Bois sauvage, the stake held by Matignon Investissement &amp; Gestion, and lastly the minority shareholdings. &quot;I am an entrepreneur, I invest in the long term,&quot; he explained.

In 2004, the new shareholders adopted a strategy that aimed to boost profits by selling off those assets they deemed to be non-strategic, closing stores in Russia and the United States, selling their ready-prepared meal tray business to the Fleury Michon group, and finally selling the Fauchon Paris stores to the company&#x27;s rival Lenôtre. Within the space of 6 years, Fauchon cut back its workforce by 700 employees, from 900 to 200 people.

Michel Ducros revised Fauchon strategy with all its suppliers and set up a strict sourcing, to promote the French savoir-faire and develop exclusive recipes. Fauchon continues to produce most of its own breads, cakes, pastries and delicatessen products on its premises (in the Paris suburb of Courbevoie for cakes and pastries).

In 2013, after the departure of the CEO Isabelle Capron, Michel Ducros appointed Eric Vincent as CEO, which announced ambitious plans for the company, aiming to have 100 outlets by 2017 (from 63 in 2013), mostly in franchises.

Despite the lack of success in the United States and China in 2009, Fauchon still aimed at international development on several big markets (Japan, Middle East, Asia and South America). Fauchon had some 60 stores and restaurants around the world in 2013. Fauchon reinforced its presence through Asia in Hong Kong in 2014 and Thailand, and invested in North America, and the Middle East, where new openings are concentrated.

On the verge of bankruptcy in 2004 (with losses of €30 million), Fauchon made its way back to a smaller loss in 2009, and in 2013 posted an operating profit of €900,000 on sales of €50 million. In Fauchon employed 270 people, operated 76 retail outlets and posted sales revenue of €180 million (including sales by franchises), 80% of which in international markets. In June 2020, after many years of poor financial performance, Fauchon went into administration.

===2015: creation of Fauchon Hospitality===
In September 2015, Fauchon adopted a new strategy and began developing a luxury hospitality branch. In March 2018, the company launched Fauchon Hospitality to develop a network of luxury boutique hotels around the world, with a focus on Japan, Europe and the Middle East. Fauchon Hospitality is headed by Jacques-Olivier Chauvin, previously CEO of Relais &amp; Châteaux and SVP of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels. Samy Vischel, president of Fauchon, is vice president of Fauchon Hospitality. Bernard Lambert is the international business advisor of the project; he was the president of the SBM and the Méridien company.

Fauchon partnered with the upscale hotel group Esprit de France, a subsidiary of Compagnie Lebon, to create and co-manage the first Fauchon L&#x27;Hôtel on the Place de la Madeleine in Paris in a building acquired by Qatar National Bank. It opened 1 September 2018. The five-star hotel is affiliated with Leading Hotels of the World.

Richard Martinet (Affine Design) was Fauchon&#x27;s original interior designer, assisted by the Atelier Paluel Marmont, although the majority of the design work was carried out by architects DTACC. The hotel is managed by Jérôme Montantème. It presents a hotel concept created by Emmanuelle Mordacq, president of the agency NeoPlaces agency: the GLAM hotel: a Gourmet hotel (creative Parisian pastry associated with French culinary tradition), Located in the center of Paris (Place de la Madeleine, where Fauchon was created 130 years ago), offering personalized arty attentions and experiences, always in line with women &quot;Mesdames&quot; (sophisticated lighting, appropriately sized bathrobes, Carita toiletries and spa, etc.).

===From 2018 to 2020: financial difficulties and closure of the historic store===
The historic site of Place de la Madeleine was hit hard successively by the attacks of January and November 2015, in 2018 by the yellow vests crisis, the strikes of 2019–2020, and the virtual disappearance of tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic.

On January 29, 2020, the Fauchon Receptions subsidiary was placed in compulsory liquidation followed on June 23, 2020, by the request for placement in receivership by the parent company which was pronounced the following week.

On July 10, 2020, a call for tenders was launched for a partial disposal plan.

On September 16, 2020, the Bobigny Commercial Court approved the company&#x27;s continuation plan which provides for the closure of the historic shops at 24–26 and 30 Place de la Madeleine. Only the hotel, the Grand Café and the tea shop remain open. The closure of these two shops will cause 77 layoffs among the staff.

===2021: Kyoto hotel opening and resumption of activities===
After seeing its continuation plan accepted in September 2020 and having closed its stores shortly after Fauchon began to relaunch its activities.

More than two years after the launch of the first Fauchon hotel in Paris, it was in Japan, in Kyoto, that the brand opened its second 5-star boutique hotel on March 16, 2021.

At the end of the year, the brand announced the upcoming opening of a third 5* hotel: FAUCHON The Riyadh Hotel in Saudi Arabia.

===2022: Training school===
The brand has announced the opening of the Fauchon school with training in food and service trades, based in Rouen.

==In popular culture==
In Thomas Harris&#x27;s book &quot;Hannibal&quot; (1999), the infamous fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter, while on a flight from Europe to America, waits until everyone is asleep before producing a Fauchon food parcel of aromatic truffled pate de foie gras and Anatolian figs, as well as a half bottle of St Estephe, which Harris says he favours.

In &quot;Cast Away&quot;, the 2000 movie directed by Robert Zemeckis, FedEx executive Chuck Noland (played by Tom Hanks) hands his colleagues a Fauchon bag containing fresh baguette bread from Paris before they board a plane. The distinctive Fauchon logo of the bag stands out.

<text>Sheldon names were used to identify launch vehicles of the Soviet Union when their Soviet names were unknown. The system was published by Dr. Charles Sheldon of the United States Library of Congress in 1968. The system emphasizes the basic families of launch vehicles with special indicators for variants within a family.

A typical Sheldon name is the F-1-m, a forerunner to the Tsyklon launch vehicle, or the F-2. The &quot;F&quot; indicates the launch vehicle family, the &quot;1&quot; indicates the upper stage, and the &quot;m&quot; indicates that the upper stage is manoeuvrable.

<text>The Cape Meares Light is an inactive lighthouse on the coast of Oregon. It is located on Cape Meares just south of Tillamook Bay. It is open to the public.

==History==
Built in 1890, Cape Meares Light served as the light station for Tillamook Bay. When it was built, the lighthouse complex included two keeper&#x27;s houses, two oil houses, and two cisterns, and was connected to the light by a boardwalk. Later additions included an attached workroom in 1895 and a garage in 1934. The light itself was iron-plated, and due to its exposure to the elements, it required frequent repainting over the years. No foghorn was ever installed at Cape Meares. In 1934, the light received electricity. Now unnecessary, the oil houses were removed.

In 1963, the lighthouse was deactivated and replaced by a newer tower. The following year, the Coast Guard made plans to demolish the light. However, due to public outcry, the plans fell through, and the Coast Guard turned the station over to Tillamook County. The light remained vacant until 1968, when the site was turned over to the Oregon State Parks Department. During this time, vandalism became a major problem for the light. Eventually, the vandalism took its toll on the keeper&#x27;s quarters and they were subsequently demolished. Among the damage, four of the bulls-eyes in the Fresnel lens were stolen. That same year, the light was opened up to the public and the light was restored, with the exception of the missing bulls-eyes. Since then, three of the four missing bulls-eyes have been recovered. The bull&#x27;s-eye of Cape Meares Light produced light visible for 21 miles. Four sides of the 8-sided lens were covered with red glass, which produced an alternating red and white beam as the light turned. In 1980, the tower itself was opened to the public.

The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

The U.S. Coast Guard permanently switched off Cape Meares Light (LLNR 675) on Wednesday, June 25, 2014, as it is no longer considered necessary for safe navigation of the seacoast.

==2010 vandalism==
Between the afternoon of January 9 and noon on January 10, 2010, an unknown vehicle reportedly drove down a blocked maintenance road to the lighthouse viewing area. A number of rounds were fired, breaking 15 of the lighthouse&#x27;s windows and several parts of the historic Fresnel lens. Additional rounds were fired into a (no longer active) Coast Guard light and surrounding equipment. While driving off the maintenance road the suspect vehicle also caused significant damage to a grassy area. Damages were initially estimated to be over $50,000, but subsequent inspections have shown it may cost more than $500,000 to repair the lens. A park ranger stated that the lens was created in Paris in 1888 and had been shipped around the tip of South America to Oregon. Early news reports stated a $1,000 reward was being offered for information leading to arrests, a figure which was raised to $3,000 by the evening of January 11. On February 10, two Oceanside men, Zachary Jon Pyle, age 23 and David Regin Wilks Jr. age 26, were arrested in connection with the vandalism. At the time of the arrests the reward had climbed to $6,000. The men were convicted and received a creative sentence by a Tillamook County District Court judge. Wilkes and Pyle were ordered to pay $100,000 to the lighthouse and serve three 16-day jail terms over three years. Each jail term started on December 27, which coincides with the date of the vandalism. They served their first sentence from December 27, 2010, to January 11, 2011, and they would do so again at the end of the next two years.

The men, who admitted they were drunk at the time, stated it was the &quot;dumbest thing they had ever done.&quot; In handing down the sentence, the judge said, &quot;Some people go to Hawaii for vacation and some people go to jail. The next three years will serve as a reminder, and you are going to get some time to contemplate that.&quot; as quoted in a news story at &quot;Lighthouse Digest&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The Cape Meares Light has served as inspiration for the lighthouse featured in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay from the 2015 narrative adventure video game Life Is Strange.

<text>The Yaquina Head Light, also known early in its existence as the Cape Foulweather Lighthouse (though Cape Foul Weather is 4 miles to the north) is a lighthouse on the Oregon Coast of the United States, established in 1873. It is located in Lincoln County, near Newport at Yaquina Head. The tower stands tall, and is the tallest lighthouse in Oregon.

==History==
Made in Paris in 1868 and shipped to Oregon, Yaquina Head Light was first lit August 20, 1873, and automated in 1966. It is active with an identifying light characteristic of two seconds on, two seconds off, two seconds on, and 14 seconds off.

A two-story keepers&#x27; dwelling was built at the time the lighthouse tower and its adjoining oil house were constructed. In 1923, a one-story keepers&#x27; house was added a short distance to the east. In 1938, a one-story building replaced the original two-story dwelling. Both dwellings and all outbuildings (a shed, a garage, etc.) were then demolished in 1984. The space is now a parking lot and grassy knoll.

Yaquina Head typically had three lighthouse keepers under the U.S. Lighthouse Service; a Head Keeper, and First and Second Assistant. The Head Keeper as well as the First Assistant usually stayed in the two-story keepers&#x27; dwelling with their families and the Second Assistant was usually a bachelor. In 1939 the U.S. Coast Guard took over the management. During World War II, 17 servicemen were stationed at Yaquina Head to keep a lookout for enemy ships.

The lighthouse still uses its original 1868 French-made, 1st order, Fixed Fresnel lens, visible out to sea. In 1993, the lighthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (reference number #73002340).

==Film and television location==
The lighthouse was used as the setting for the &quot;Moesko Island Lighthouse&quot; in the 2002 film &quot;The Ring&quot;. It had already appeared in an earlier film, &quot;Hysterical&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; 1977 television series episode &quot;The Mystery of Pirate&#x27;s Cove&quot;.

==Yaquina Head Interpretive Center==
The site was established by Congress as an Outstanding Natural Area in 1980. The Bureau of Land Management manages the Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area, including the lighthouse. The Yaquina Head Interpretive Center opened in 1997 and includes exhibits about the history and preservation of the lighthouse, and the marine life found in tide pools and along the coast. The Center includes a gift shop.

The lighthouse lantern is operated by the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitors offshore bird rookeries and wildlife. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife manages the intertidal animals, and the Oregon Department of State Lands is responsible for the intertidal lands.

Lighthouse tours are available. Space on these tours is limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis at the Interpretive Center desk.

<text>Cape Meares is a small headland on the Pacific coast in Tillamook County, Oregon, United States. The cape forms a high steep bluff on the south end of Tillamook Bay, approximately five miles (8 km) northwest of the city of Tillamook. Much of the cape is part of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department-administered Cape Meares State Scenic Viewpoint with three miles of hiking trails, which includes Cape Meares Light and the Octopus Tree. The cape is named after John Meares, a British explorer.

==Geography==
Immediately north of the cape is the community of Cape Meares, next to Cape Meares Lake. Cape Meares beach extends north of the community of Cape Meares, along a sand spit, or peninsula, that encloses Tillamook Bay. The peninsula is alternatively known as Bayocean, after a popular upscale resort town that occupied the beach in the early 20th century, until beach erosion began to destroy the town beginning in the 1930s. Today, no significant remnant of the resort town remains on the beach.

Immediately south of Cape Meares is Short Beach.

==Cape Meares State Scenic Viewpoint==
The scenic viewpoint is the location of the &quot;Octopus Tree&quot;, a large, multi-trunked Sitka Spruce with a trunk circumference of about 50 feet. It is accessible via a short hike from the main parking lot.

<doc id="739969" wikidata="Q161804" url="?curid=739969" title="Nuristani languages">
<text>The Nuristani languages are one of the three groups within the Indo-Iranian language family, alongside the Indo-Aryan and Iranian languages. They have approximately 214,000 speakers primarily in Nuristan and Kunar provinces in northeastern Afghanistan and a few adjacent valleys in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa&#x27;s Chitral District, Pakistan. The region inhabited by the Nuristanis is located in the southern Hindu Kush mountains, and is drained by the Alingar River in the west, the Pech River in the center, and the Landai Sin and Kunar rivers in the east. More broadly, the Nuristan region is located at the northern intersection of the Indian subcontinent and the Iranian plateau. 

The Nuristani languages were not described in literature until the 19th century. The older name for the region was Kafiristan due to their pre-Islamic religious practices, but this term has been abandoned in favor of Nuristan (&quot;land of light&quot;).

== Languages ==
Nuristani languages can be classified into:

* Katë, also called &quot;Kati&quot;, &quot;Kamviri&quot; or &quot;Kamkata-vari&quot;, is the most-spoken Nuristani language at 150,000 speakers. It includes the Western, Northeastern, and Southeastern dialects. 
* Prasun, also called &quot;Vasi-vari&quot;, is spoken by 8,000 speakers. Prasun is considered as the most divergent member of the group, featuring a distinct grammar and phonology.
* Ashkun, also called &quot;Ashkunu&quot; or &quot;Sanu-viri&quot;, is spoken by 40,000 speakers. Although Ashkun shares commonalities with other Nuristani languages, there are some sound changes in Ashkun that are not shared by any other member.
* Nuristani Kalasha, formerly known as &quot;Waigali&quot;, is spoken by 12,000 speakers. It is rather closely related with Tregami and Zemiaki. Nuristani Kalasha is distinct from Kalasha-mun, which is an Indo-Aryan language.
* Tregami () is spoken by 3,500 speakers in the three villages of Gambir, Kaṭâr, and Devoz in the Watapur District of Kunar Province, Afghanistan.
* Zemiaki is spoken by 500 speakers. It is so far the smallest Nuristani language known to exist. Local traditions confirm a historical link with Nuristani Kalasha.

== History ==


Nuristani languages are Indo-European languages, ultimately descending from Proto-Indo-European. The prehistory of Nuristani is unclear, except that it apparently split off from the rest of the Indo-European languages as part of the Indo-Iranian branch. 

The Proto-Indo-Iranian language of late 3rd millennium BCE represents the reconstructed ancestral language which the Nuristani languages share with Sanskrit and Avestan as their common origin. This makes Nuristani languages closely related to Indo-Iranian languages like Hindustani and Persian, and more distantly related to other Indo-European languages like Lithuanian and Icelandic. However, its classification within the Indo-Iranian branch was debated until recent scholarship settled its position as a third branch distinct from Indo-Aryan or Iranian, though extensive Indo-Aryan influence can be detected.

Proto-Nuristani is the reconstructed ancestral language of all the modern-day Nuristani languages, representing the latest point at which the languages were still unified as a single language. Proto-Nuristani began breaking off into distinct languages from around 8th century BCE. The influences from surrounding Indo-Aryan and Iranian languages onto early Nuristani languages have been highly complex, due to different patterns of migration and settlement by various Nuristani-speaking tribes through their history.

The Nuristani languages continued their development as the primary languages of the Nuristani peoples, who maintained a history of interaction with surrounding Indo-Aryan peoples and later the Afghan people, who became dominant in the region. In the 1890s, the region of Nuristan was finally incorporated into Afghanistan due to geopolitical pressure. Today, ethnic Nuristanis make up over 99% of the population of Nuristan. The Nuristani languages are spoken by about 78% of the total Nuristani population, and by 84% in villages.

Today, Indo-Aryan Dardic languages like Khowar, Pashai, and Kalasha-mun, and Eastern Iranian languages like Munji, Sanglechi, and Yidgha are natively spoken in the neighboring regions of Nuristan, leading to language contact. Dameli, a neighboring Indo-Aryan language, has a significant amount of vocabulary borrowed from Nuristani languages, and thus was previously classified as a Nuristani language. However, the morphology and the pronominal system of Dameli are charcteristically Indo-Aryan, leading to its re-classification as Dardic.

== Vocabulary ==

The most archaic layer of Nuristani lexicon is the common inheritance from Proto-Indo-European, shared with other Indo-European languages. For example, Tregami &quot;&quot; is cognate with English &quot;&quot;, Russian &quot;&quot;, and Spanish &quot;&quot;. 

Much of Nuristani lexicon traces back to the Proto-Indo-Iranian language of the late 3rd millennium BCE. For example, Ashkun &quot;&quot; &quot;hair&quot; is cognate with Sanskrit &quot;&quot;. Due to the relative isolation of the Nuristan region until the turn of the 20th century, the Nuristani languages were thought to have retained some inherited words from the ancient Indo-Iranian religion, predating Hinduism and Zoroastrianism. However, recent research on Nuristani theonyms shows robust semantic and linguistic correspondences with Indo-Aryan religious terminologies, which points to a significant post-Vedic Hindu influence on Nuristani theology and religious vocabulary. Remnants of inherited Indo-Iranian elements may have survived in some Prasun theonyms with hitherto unknown etymologies. In contrast, there is no trace of any Zoroastrian influence on Nuristani vocabulary, suggesting that Nuristani languages were not widely spoken in areas where Zoroastrianism was practiced. 

Nuristani-speaking peoples have since long participated in enduring social contact with Indo-Aryan speakers, leading to a large number of early Indo-Aryan loanwards and relative semantic closeness among the shared cognates between Indo-Aryan and Nuristani languages. There have been important historical exchanges between the Nuristani religious practices and earlier forms of Hinduism. For instance, Katë &quot;&quot; may be linked to the Hindu deity Indra, from which it derives Katë &quot;&quot; &quot;rainbow&quot; (&quot;Indra-bow&quot;) and &quot;&quot; &quot;earthquake&quot; (&quot;Indra-impulse&quot;).

Middle Indo-Aryan languages like Gandhari have shared a broader cultural and linguistic milieu with Nuristani languages for many centuries in the Gandhara region. In addition, Nuristani languages borrowed words for &quot;law&quot; and &quot;judge&quot; from the Iranian Bactrian language around the 1st century CE, suggesting some degree of contact with Bactrian-speaking state institutions, possibly the Kushan empire. 

The most recent influx of loanwords into Nuristani is from Persian and Pashto since the incorporation Nuristan into Afghanistan in the 1890s.

The chart below compares some basic vocabulary among the modern-day Nuristani languages.

== Syntax ==

Many Nuristani languages have subject–object–verb (SOV) word order, like most of the other Indo-Iranian languages, and unlike the nearby Dardic Kashmiri language, which has verb-second word order.

<doc id="739974" wikidata="Q474317" url="?curid=739974" title="Rostow's stages of growth">
<text>The Rostovian take-off model (also called &quot;Rostow&#x27;s Stages of Growth&quot;) is one of the major historical models of economic growth. It was developed by W. W. Rostow. The model postulates that economic modernization occurs in five basic stages, of varying length.

# Traditional society
# Preconditions for take-off
# Take-off
# Drive to maturity
# Age of High mass consumption

Rostow asserts that countries go through each of these stages fairly linearly, and set out a number of conditions that were likely to occur in investment, consumption and social trends at each state. Not all of the conditions were certain to occur at each stage, however, and the stages and transition periods may occur at varying lengths from country to country, and even from region to region.

Rostow&#x27;s model is one of the more structuralist models of economic growth, particularly in comparison with the &#x27;backwardness&#x27; model developed by Alexander Gerschenkron. The two models are not necessarily mutually exclusive, however, and many countries seem to follow both models rather adequately.

Beyond the structured picture of growth itself, another important part of the model is that economic take-off must initially be led by a few individual sectors. This belief echoes David Ricardo’s comparative advantage thesis and criticizes Marxist revolutionaries push for economic self-reliance in that it pushes for the &#x27;initial&#x27; development of only one or two sectors over the development of all sectors equally. This became one of the important concepts in the theory of modernization in the social evolutionism.

== Theoretical Framework ==
Rostow&#x27;s model is descendent from the liberal school of economics, emphasizing the efficacy of modern concepts of free trade and the ideas of Adam Smith. It also denies Friedrich List’s argument that countries reliant on exporting raw materials may get “locked in”, and be unable to diversify, in that Rostow&#x27;s model states that countries may need to depend on a few raw material exports to finance the development of manufacturing sectors which are not yet of superior competitiveness in the early stages of take-off. In that way, Rostow&#x27;s model does not deny John Maynard Keynes in that it allows for a degree of government control over domestic development not generally accepted by some ardent free trade advocates. Although empirical at times, Rostow is hardly free of normative discourse. As a basic assumption, Rostow believes that countries want to modernize as he describes modernization, and that society will assent to the materialistic norms of economic growth.

== Stages ==
=== Traditional Societies ===
Traditional societies are marked by their pre-Newtonian understanding and use of technology. These are societies which have pre-scientific understandings of gadgets, agriculture is predominant and society has a hierarchical structure. The norms of economic growth are completely absent from these societies.The society has a low ceiling on per capita output because of the backwardness of the technology. Agriculture is the main source of income.

=== Preconditions to Take-off ===
The preconditions to take-off according to Rostow, refers to that the society begins committing itself to secular education, that it enables a degree of capital mobilization, especially through the establishment of banks and currency, that an entrepreneurial class forms, and that the secular concept of manufacturing develops, with only a few sectors developing at this point. This leads to a take-off in ten to fifty years. At this stage, there is a limited production function, and therefore a limited output.

=== Take-off ===
Take-off then occurs when sector led growth becomes common and society is driven more by economic processes than traditions. At this point, the norms of economic growth are well established. In discussing the take-off, Rostow is a noted early adopter of the term “transition”, which is to describe the passage of a traditional to a modern economy. After take-off, a country will take as long as fifty to one hundred years to reach maturity. Globally, this stage occurred during the Industrial Revolution in economic development.

====Conditions for Take-off====
The requirements of take-off are the following two related but necessary conditions:

#A rise in the rate of productive investment from approximately 10% or less to over 20% of national income or net national product;
#The development of one or more substantial manufacturing sectors with a high rate of growth; he indicates the leading sectors in the economy. Rostow regards the development of leading sectors as the &#x27;analytical bone structure&#x27; of the stages of economic growth. There are generally three sectors of an economy:

# Primary Sector - Agriculture
# Secondary Sector - Manufacturing
# Tertiary Sector - Services

=== Drive to Maturity ===
After take-off, there follows a long interval of sustained, if fluctuating, progress, as the now regularly growing economy drives to extend modern technology over the whole front of its economic activity. Some 10-20% of the national income is steadily invested, permitting output regularly to outstrip the increase in population. The makeup of the economy changes unceasingly as technique improves, new industries accelerate, and older industries level off. The economy finds its place in the international economy: goods formerly imported are produced at home; new import requirements develop, and new export commodities match them. Society makes such terms as it will with the requirements of modern efficient production, balancing off the new against the older values and institutions, or revising the latter in such ways as to support rather than to retard the growth process.
The drive to maturity refers to the need for the economy to diversify. The sectors of the economy which lead initially begin to level off, while other sectors begin to take off. This diversity leads to greatly reduced rates of poverty and rising standards of living, as a society no longer needs to sacrifice its comfort in order to strengthen certain sectors.

=== Age of High Mass Consumption ===
The age of high mass consumption refers to the period of contemporary comfort afforded many western nations, wherein consumers concentrate on durable goods, and hardly remember the subsistence concerns of previous stages. Rostow uses the Buddenbrooks dynamics metaphor to describe this change in attitude. In Thomas Mann’s novel &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;, a family is chronicled for three generations. The first generation is interested in economic development, the second in its position in society. The third, already having money and prestige, concerns itself with the arts and music, worrying little about those previous, earthly concerns. So too, in the age of high mass consumption, a society is able to choose between concentrating on military and security issues, on equality and welfare issues, or on developing great luxuries for its upper class. Each country in this position chooses its own balance between these three goals.

Of particular note is the fact that Rostow&#x27;s &quot;Age of High Mass Consumption&quot; dovetails with (occurring before) Daniel Bell&#x27;s hypothesized &quot;Post-Industrial Society.&quot; The Bell and Rostovian models collectively suggest that economic maturation inevitably brings on job-growth which can be followed by wage escalation in the secondary economic sector (manufacturing), which is then followed by dramatic growth in the tertiary economic sector (commerce and services). In the Bell model, the tertiary economic sector rises to predominance, encompassing perhaps 65 to 75 percent of the employment in a given economy. Maturation can then bring-on deindustrialization as manufacturers reorient to cheaper labor markets, and deindustrialization can, in turn, destabilize the tertiary sector. The suggestion is that mature economies may implicitly destabilize and cycle back-and-forth between the final stages of the Rostovian-Bell developmental phases as they rebalance themselves, over time, and re-evolve their economic base.

== Criticism of the Model ==

1: Rostow is historical in the sense that the result is known at the outset and is derived from the historical geography of a developed, bureaucratic society.

2: Rostow is mechanical in the sense that the underlying motor of change is not disclosed and therefore the stages become little more than a classificatory system based on data from developed countries.

3: His model is based on American and European history and defines the American norm of high mass consumption as integral to the economic development process of all industrialized societies.

4: His model assumes the inevitable adoption of Neoliberal trade policies which allow the manufacturing base of a given advanced polity to be relocated to lower-wage regions.

Rostow&#x27;s thesis is biased towards a western model of modernization, but at the time of Rostow the world&#x27;s only mature economies were in the west, and no controlled economies were in the &quot;era of high mass consumption.&quot; The model de-emphasizes differences between sectors in capitalistic vs. communistic societies, but seems to innately recognize that modernization can be achieved in different ways in different types of economies.

The most disabling assumption that Rostow is accused of is trying to fit economic progress into a linear system. This charge is correct in that many countries make false starts, reach a degree of transition and then slip back, or as is the case in contemporary Russia, slip back from high mass consumption (or almost) to a country in transition. On the other hand, Rostow&#x27;s analysis seems to emphasize success because it is trying to explain success. To Rostow, if a country can be a disciplined, uncorrupt investor in itself, can establish certain norms into its society and polity, and can identify sectors where it has some sort of advantage, it can enter into transition and eventually reach modernity. Rostow would point to a failure in one of these conditions as a cause for non-linearity.

Another problem that Rostow&#x27;s work has is that it considers mostly large countries: countries with a large population (Japan), with natural resources available at just the right time in its history (Coal in Northern European countries), or with a large land mass (Argentina). He has little to say and indeed offers little hope for small countries, such as Rwanda, which do not have such advantages. Neo-liberal economic theory to Rostow, and many others, does offer hope to much of the world that economic maturity is coming and the age of high mass consumption is nigh. But that does leave a sort of &#x27;grim meathook future&#x27; for the , which do not have the resources, political will, or external backing to become competitive. (See Dependency theory)

<doc id="739980" wikidata="Q112604647" url="?curid=739980" title="Buffalo Metro Rail">
<text>Buffalo Metro Rail is the public transit rail system in Buffalo, New York, operated by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA). The system consists of a single, light rail line that runs for most of the length of Main Street (New York State Route 5) from KeyBank Center in Canalside to the south campus of the University at Buffalo in the northeast corner of the city. The first section of the line opened in October 1984; the current system was completed in November 1986. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==
=== Urban rail transit in Buffalo before 1950 ===

Streetcars and interurban railways existed in Buffalo from the 1830s to 1950, with several lines also radiating into surrounding communities such as Tonawanda, Niagara Falls and even the Niagara Peninsula in Canada. These lines merged in 1902 to form the International Railway Company in 1902. With the rise in bus usage starting in the mid-1930s, streetcar ridership declined rapidly until 1950, with several streetcar lines being shuttered over time until the rail system was eliminated altogether.

=== Planning and construction of current system ===

Despite the decline of Buffalo&#x27;s industry and population over the next few decades, federal funds and a desire to revitalize downtown spurred the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, the IRC&#x27;s successor, to construct the modern Metro Rail line, starting in 1979. It came amid a surge in light rail construction in mid-sized cities nationwide, as Denver, Portland, Sacramento, and San Jose also built systems at the same time.

The line opened in stages: the surface portion opened on October 9, 1984, while the subway opened as far as Amherst Street Station on May 20, 1985, following an opening ceremony on May 18. The line was further extended to University Station, serving the University at Buffalo, on November 10, 1986, due to construction issues at LaSalle Station. At the time of the start of construction, the line was intended to be the first line for an extensive heavy rail system that would spread throughout the city and suburbs. However, during the construction of the line and afterward, Buffalo&#x27;s population declined significantly by approximately 55% from around 580,000 in 1950 to about 261,000 in 2010 and the new line&#x27;s ridership was much lower than originally anticipated. The cost of the urban section was so high that no funding was available to extend the lines into the suburbs, including the Amherst campus of the University at Buffalo. Efforts to obtain funding for feeder lines have historically been met with little to no success.

=== Renovations and expansion ===
Although a centerpiece of the original line, the downtown transit mall did not live up to expectations. Because of poor traffic patterns on Main Street, some business groups occasionally called for the removal of the transit system so that they can return to normal vehicle traffic and curbside parking.

In 2008, Buffalo began a project to reintroduce cars to Main Street. The project in question involved creating a shared trackbed/roadway with curbside parking, as well as the permanent closure of the Theater Station, which occurred on February 18, 2013. The closure of Theater Station meant that Fountain Plaza Station, located south in the 500 block of Main Street, now serves as the northern terminus of the Free Fare Zone. On January 23, 2015, after less than two years of construction, traffic was reintroduced to the 600 block of Main Street, between Tupper and Chippewa Streets, in the Theater District. On December 15, 2015, traffic was reintroduced to the 500 block of Main Street, between Chippewa and Mohawk streets, in the Central Business District. In late 2022, traffic was reintroduced to Lower Main between Exchange and Scott Street. Work began in July 2023 to complete the final stretch of Cars Sharing Main Street, with work between Mohawk and Exchange. The project is being constructed in conjunction with the total replacement of the trackbed in the 400 block as well as the installation of a crossover track to decrease the effects of single-tracking during the process.

On January 9, 2017, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced in his State of the State address that funding would be secured for the Amherst and Cobblestone line extensions. If successful, this would be the first extension in the service&#x27;s history. Funding for an environmental review into the Amherst extension was approved in 2018, and it was expected to take between 24 and 30 months.

In 2019 Tim Kennedy and Crystal People-Stokes secured a $100M state commitment to fund renovation and repair work throughout the system that had largely been delayed since the line&#x27;s opening. The funding is intended for total track replacement, catenary replacements, fastener and pad replacements, as well as two station complete rebuilds (Canalside and Church) and increased passenger comfort amenities at other stations. Following the reconstruction of Church Station, expected to begin in July 2024, NFTA intends to begin the process for a redesign of the Lafayette Square station.

== Operations ==
=== Route ===
Metro Rail is a light rail transit (LRT) system as characterized by the American Public Transportation Association although it shares many characteristics with &quot;heavy rail&quot; metro systems and could be considered a &quot;light metro.&quot; With combined subway and surface sections, the line can be classified as a semi-metro system.

About 80% of its track () is an underground subway with high-level platforms. This section has eight stations that are spaced fairly widely apart, comparable to subway systems elsewhere. This section is cut-and-cover from Allen/Medical Campus to Utica, then deep-bored from Delavan/Canisius College to University. The remaining 20% of its track () are on the surface on Main Street in downtown Buffalo, which includes a brief underpass of Buffalo’s tallest building, the Seneca One Tower. On the surface section, trains interact with automobile traffic from the theater district where it emerges from the tunnel until Mohawk Street where it reverts to a transit mall and at cross streets, where movements are governed by traffic signals.

Metro Rail operates electric multiple-unit light rail vehicles (LRVs) in two-to-four car trains with power drawn from an overhead catenary system. Catenary poles on the surface section are spaced every to support the overhead electrical lines. Three-car trains are limited to rush hour and special events and four-car trains to special events. The Buffalo trains join Philadelphia&#x27;s SEPTA light rail cars as the only modern non-articulated LRVs operating in the United States.
=== Stations ===
;
=== Fares ===
Fares are collected through a proof-of-payment system, enforced through random ticket inspections. Travel is free on the above ground portion of the system. Regular fare is $2; various passes are also available for sale. All stations have ticket machines. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, NFTA temporarily suspended fare collection starting in late March 2020. Fare collection resumed on June 29, 2020.

=== Schedules ===
Metro Rail runs as follows: Monday-Friday from 5:10am-12:50am, Saturdays from 7:05am-12:50am and Sundays and holidays from 8:00am-11:50pm (although most bus service is available until approximately 12:30am). Trains run as often as once every ten minutes at rush hour and generally no less often than once every twenty minutes. In July 2008, the NFTA reported that the passenger count &quot;eclipsed the previous year&#x27;s tally by 23%.&quot; As a result, the following September, the NFTA implemented an earlier start for the weekday schedule in response to an 11% increase in ridership over eight months of growth.

=== Ridership ===
Annual ridership statistics are from the Federal Transit Administration&#x27;s National Transit Database, which contains data from 1996 to 2011:

== Plans for expansion ==
Buffalo Metro Rail was ranked 25th in the nation in light rail daily ridership service in 2013, with 5,058,300 passengers. However, it is noted that the line currently lacks extended branches to the suburbs, being confined to the city limits of Buffalo. One group, the Citizens Regional Transit Corporation (CRTC), advocates for expansion. As indicated in its statement, the CRTC seeks to educate the public, public officials, their authorities, and agencies in the Buffalo-Niagara region about the benefits of a comprehensive transportation system including an expanded Metro Rail. In April 2011, the group stated that the 600 block of Main Street, which has Shea&#x27;s Performing Arts Center along with hotels and bars, should be converted into a mixed automobile and rail system. The 600 block was re-opened to automobile traffic in 2015.

In December 2012, the NFTA announced it had secured funding of $1.6 million to commission a study in 2013 of bus and rail access to University at Buffalo&#x27;s North Campus. If a rail project were to be approved, the system would be running in 7–10 years. On February 28, 2013, it was announced that a group consisting of representatives from the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, planners from the City of Buffalo, the Buffalo Sabres and NFTA are working on a plan to extend the southern terminus of the rail line just beyond the NFTA rail yard at the DL&amp;W Terminal to a new parking garage being built near the Medical Campus.

=== Amherst corridor ===
In the December 4, 2006, edition of &quot;The Spectrum,&quot; a publication of the University at Buffalo (UB), it was announced that school president John B. Simpson was planning to get a project underway that would connect UB&#x27;s North, South and downtown campuses via a transportation system. The proposed systems included a subway, trolley or light rail. A study that was published in 2014 detailed four alternatives chosen for the corridor, including a light rail corridor and three bus rapid transit corridors. The light rail corridor would extend from a turnout at University station, head north to Niagara Falls Boulevard past the Boulevard Mall, turn to Sweet Home Road, enter the University at Buffalo North Campus and parallel Interstate 990 ending at the Crosspoint Business Park in Getzville.

Planning and funding is currently underway for a northbound Niagara Falls Boulevard extension to the University at Buffalo North Campus. As of 2019, the proposed turnout tunnel to Niagara Falls Boulevard has been shortened, increasing the overall length of the street-side light rail portion of the route, and a new tunnel has been added to the design near I-290. In addition, the chosen corridor would parallel Audubon Boulevard and end at a park-and-ride after passing under I-990, rather than continuing to the Crosspoint Business Park. The NFTA has also released a finalized scoping report and a draft environmental study report, and has been receiving community input on the project.

=== Airport corridor ===
The Airport corridor would begin in Downtown Buffalo, near Church station and continue in an easterly direction in/out Division Streets, diagonally in a northeastern direction near Jefferson Avenue toward the Buffalo Central Terminal, cross Broadway and then continue eastbound in its private right-of-way to the Thruway Plaza, Walden Galleria and Buffalo-Niagara International Airport.

=== Tonawandas corridor ===
The Tonawandas corridor would operate from LaSalle station northwesterly to the city of Tonawanda using the abandoned Erie Railroad tracks. The NFTA purchased 12 Presidents&#x27; Conference Committee (PCC) streetcars in the 1980s to serve the Tonawanda turn-out, a proposed Metro Rail extension to Tonawanda and North Tonawanda. These cars were built by the St. Louis Car Company and acquired by Cleveland, Ohio&#x27;s Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority second-hand in 1953. It was determined after initial trial runs that the PCCs were too wide for existing station platforms and the plan was abandoned. The PCCs were sold to the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association (BHRA) and scrapped in 2003 when the BHRA folded.

=== DL&amp;W Terminal renewal ===
NFTA is repurposing the DL&amp;W Terminal with plans for a new indoor Metro Rail DL&amp;W Station on the first floor of the terminal, on the Buffalo River side, with direct Buffalo Bricks Walkway access to Canalside, with staircases and escalators to the second floor of the terminal and the elimination of the Special Events Station. Although a short distance from the current Special Events station that acts as a terminus for current service, this will constitute the first actual expansion of the system since its opening. On the second floor, NFTA has assigned private developer Savarino Cos, to plan the $30 million redevelopment of the enormous amount of first and second floor floor-space, along with direct access to the KeyBank Center, with a $3 million sheltered pedestrian skybridge from the second floor, near the intersection of South Park Avenue and Main Street, from the terminal to the KeyBank Center, with $2 million of that financed with federal aid. Despite Savarino abruptly shutting down operations in August 2023, NFTA has continued work on the $87 million project. The newly designed station will have capacity for two four-car trains to serve the station simultaneously. Artwork will be prominent within station, as well as a 6,000 sq ft space, to be determined for use upon station completion. The stair tower alongside the station will be open for service in May 2025, with the pedestrian skybridge to KeyBank Center ready in 2026.

Although bankrupt in August 2023, Savarino has continued working on the project with a separate entity. Expected to be ready in 2026, the second floor of the structure will have 75,0000 square feet of indoor space and 55,000 square feet of outdoor space. This will establish a new four-season passenger destination to further enhance and activate the Canalside area.

== Rolling stock ==
The NFTA has a fleet of 27 (originally 29) rigid-bodied (non-articulated) LRVs for the Metro Rail system, numbered sequentially from 101 to 127. They were built in 1983 by Tokyu Car Corporation (now known as Japan Transport Engineering Company). The cars&#x27; body shell design is notably similar to that of the earlier articulated US Standard Light Rail Vehicle, whose shells were also fabricated by Tokyu Car Corp. for Boeing Vertol. The cars have a maximum service speed of , but trains run at in the above-ground section of the line. There are three sliding doors on each side of each LRV; these doors can be opened by passengers by push buttons on the outside wall of the train when trains are stopped at stations on the above-ground section of the line. However, in practice, train operators typically open all doors and extend all the retractable staircases at all above-stations. The NFTA acquired twelve PCC streetcars from the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority in 1990 for service on the never-built Tonawandas branch. They were later sold to the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association in 2003.

=== Rehabilitation ===
In May 2006, it was announced that all of the LRVs would be rehabilitated by AnsaldoBreda. The rehabilitation featured many improvements, including enhanced video monitoring of the railcar interiors, an upgraded braking system, rebuilt HVAC systems, rebuilt door systems, a new interior closely representing the agency&#x27;s new look, upgraded propulsion systems and repairs to the body shells. In addition, the rail cars were to receive new monitoring systems, an automated announcement system calling out stations, new door chimes and interior/exterior LED signage to replace existing roll signs. The total project cost was estimated at $40 million for rehabilitation of the 27 cars.

Because the refurbished cars have new car-to-car communications equipment, they are not compatible with unrefurbished cars and cannot run with them on the same line. The project originally planned to use SuperSteel&#x27;s manufacturing facilities in Schenectady, New York, for the overhaul. However, due to the loss of orders and a dip in the economy, SuperSteel closed the facility in April 2009. The closure cost 175 jobs and delayed the rehabilitation. The project later was moved to Gray Manufacturing Industries, located in Hornell, New York. The first two cars were due back in revenue service in July 2010.

After a lengthy delay, which put the project years behind the original schedule, the first two cars (fleet numbers 114 and 123) were returned to service on March 9, 2012. However, the cost of refurbishment per car had since gone up and now averaged $1.7 million per car with a total cost of $45 million to complete all cars in the fleet. Three more cars (numbers 110, 111 and 126) were sent out and were expected to be completed before the end of 2012, but did not return to service until the fall of 2013. On October 1, 2014, car 113 also returned to service. Since then, 20 more cars (fleet numbers 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 124, 125 and 127) have returned to service, marking the completion of the program, with the total number of refurbished rail cars to a complete 27 as of February 1, 2022.

<doc id="739987" wikidata="Q161101" url="?curid=739987" title="Dardic languages">
<text>The Dardic languages (also Dardu or Pisaca), or Hindu-Kush Indo-Aryan languages, are a group of several Indo-Aryan languages spoken in northern Pakistan, northwestern India and parts of northeastern Afghanistan. This region has sometimes been referred to as Dardistan.

Rather than close linguistic or ethnic relationships, the original term Dardic was a geographical concept, denoting the northwesternmost group of Indo-Aryan languages. There is no ethnic unity among the speakers of these languages nor can the languages be traced to a single ancestor. After further research, the term &quot;Eastern Dardic&quot; is now a legitimate grouping of languages that excludes some languages in the Dardistan region that are now considered to be part of different language families.

The extinct Gandhari language, used by the Gandhara civilization, from circa 1500 BCE, was Dardic in nature. Linguistic evidence has linked Gandhari with some living Dardic languages, particularly Torwali and other Kohistani languages. There is limited evidence that the Kohistani languages are descended from Gandhari.

== History ==
Leitner&#x27;s Dardistan, in its broadest sense, became the basis for the classification of the languages in the north-west of the Indo-Aryan linguistic area (which includes present-day eastern Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and Kashmir). George Abraham Grierson, with scant data, borrowed the term and proposed an independent Dardic family within the Indo-Iranian languages. However, Grierson&#x27;s formulation of Dardic is now considered to be incorrect in its details, and has therefore been rendered obsolete by modern scholarship.

Georg Morgenstierne, who conducted an extensive fieldwork in the region during the early 20th century, revised Grierson&#x27;s classification and came to the view that only the &quot;Kafiri&quot; (Nuristani) languages formed an independent branch of the Indo-Iranian languages separate from Indo-Aryan and Iranian families, and determined that the Dardic languages were unmistakably Indo-Aryan in character.Due to their geographic isolation, many Dardic languages have preserved archaisms and other features of Old Indo-Aryan. These features include three sibilants, several types of clusters of consonants, and archaic or antiquated vocabulary lost in other modern Indo-Aryan languages. Kalasha and Khowar are the most archaic of all modern Indo-Aryan languages, retaining a great part of Sanskrit case inflexion, and retaining many words in a nearly Sanskritic form. For example &quot;driga&quot; &quot;long&quot; in Kalasha is nearly identical to &quot;dīrghá&quot; in Sanskrit and &quot;ašrú&quot; &quot;tear&quot; in Khowar is identical to the Sanskrit word.

French Indologist Gérard Fussman points out that the term Dardic is geographic, not a linguistic expression. Taken literally, it allows one to believe that all the languages spoken in Dardistan are &quot;Dardic&quot;. It also allows one to believe that all the people speaking Dardic languages are &quot;Dards&quot; and the area they live in is &quot;Dardistan&quot;. A term used by classical geographers to identify the area inhabited by an indefinite people, and used in &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; in reference to people outside Kashmir, has come to have ethnographic, geographic, and even political significance today.

==Classification==

George Morgenstierne&#x27;s scheme corresponds to recent scholarly consensus. As such, the historic Dardic&#x27;s position as a legitimate genetic subfamily has been repeatedly called into question; it is widely acknowledged that the grouping is more geographical in nature, as opposed to linguistic. Indeed, Buddruss rejected the Dardic grouping entirely, and placed the languages within Central Indo-Aryan. Other scholars, such as Strand and Mock, have similarly voiced doubts in this regard.

However, Kachru contrasts &quot;Midland languages&quot; spoken in the plains, such as Punjabi and Urdu, with &quot;Mountain languages&quot;, such as Dardic. Kogan has also suggested an &#x27;East-Dardic&#x27; sub-family; comprising the &#x27;Kashmiri&#x27;, &#x27;Kohistani&#x27; and &#x27;Shina&#x27; groups.

The case of Kashmiri is peculiar. Its Dardic features are close to Shina, often said to belong to an eastern Dardic language subfamily. Kachru notes that &quot;the Kashmiri language used by Kashmiri Hindu Pandits has been powerfully influenced by Indian culture and literature, and the greater part of its vocabulary is now of Indian origin, and is allied to that of Sanskritic Indo-Aryan languages of northern India&quot;.

While it is true that many Dardic languages have been influenced by non-Dardic languages, Dardic may have also influenced neighbouring Indo-Aryan lects in turn, such as Punjabi, the Pahari languages, including the Central Pahari languages of Uttarakhand, and purportedly even further afield. Some linguists have posited that Dardic lects may have originally been spoken throughout a much larger region, stretching from the mouth of the Indus (in Sindh) northwards in an arc, and then eastwards through modern day Himachal Pradesh to Kumaon. However, this has not been conclusively established.

==Subdivisions==
Dardic languages have been organized into the following subfamilies:

* Eastern Dardic languages:
** Kashmiri languages: Kashmiri, Poguli, Kishtwari;
** Shina languages: Shina, Brokskad, Kalkoti, Kohistani Shina, Kundal Shahi, Palula, Savi, Ushoji;
** Kohistani languages: Maiya (Indus Kohistani), Bateri, Chilisso, Gawri, Gawro, Torwali, Mankiyali, Wotapuri-Katarqalai, Tirahi
* Chitrali languages: Kalasha (Urtsuniwar), Khowar
* Pashai languages: Pashai
* Kunar languages: Dameli, Gawar-Bati, Nangalami (Grangali), Shumashti

==Characteristics==
===Loss of voiced aspiration===
Virtually all Dardic languages have experienced a partial or complete loss of voiced aspirated consonants. Khowar uses the word &quot;buum&quot; for &#x27;earth&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;bhumi&quot;), Pashai uses the word &quot;duum&quot; for &#x27;smoke&#x27; (Urdu: &quot;dhuān&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;dhūma&quot;) and Kashmiri uses the word &quot;dọd&quot; for &#x27;milk&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;dugdha&quot;, Urdu: &quot;dūdh&quot;). Tonality has developed in most (but not all) Dardic languages, such as Khowar and Pashai, as a compensation. Punjabi and Western Pahari languages similarly lost aspiration but have virtually all developed tonality to partially compensate (e.g. Punjabi &quot;kár&quot; for &#x27;house&#x27;, compare with Urdu &quot;ghar&quot;).

===Dardic metathesis and other changes===
Both ancient and modern Dardic languages demonstrate a marked tendency towards metathesis where a &quot;pre- or postconsonantal &#x27;r&#x27; is shifted forward to a preceding syllable&quot;. This was seen in Ashokan rock edicts (erected 269 BCE to 231 BCE) in the Gandhara region, where Dardic dialects were and still are widespread. Examples include a tendency to spell the Classical Sanskrit words &quot;priyadarshi&quot; (one of the titles of Emperor Ashoka) as instead &quot;priyadrashi&quot; and &quot;dharma&quot; as &quot;dhrama&quot;. Modern-day Kalasha uses the word &quot;driga&quot; &#x27;long&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;dirgha&quot;). Palula uses &quot;drubalu&quot; &#x27;weak&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;durbala&quot;) and &quot;brhuj&quot; &#x27;birch tree&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;bhurja&quot;). Kashmiri uses &quot;drạ̄lid&quot; &#x27;impoverished&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;daridra&quot;) and &quot;krama&quot; &#x27;work&#x27; or &#x27;action&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;karma&quot;). 

Dardic languages also show other consonantal changes. Kashmiri, for instance, has a marked tendency to shift &quot;k&quot; to &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;j&quot; to &quot;z&quot; (e.g. &quot;zon&quot; &#x27;person&#x27; is cognate to Sanskrit &quot;jan&quot; &#x27;person or living being&#x27; and Persian &quot;jān&quot; &#x27;life&#x27;).

===Verb position in Dardic===
Unique among the Dardic languages, Kashmiri presents &quot;verb second&quot; as the normal grammatical form. This is similar to many Germanic languages, such as German and Dutch, as well as Uto-Aztecan O&#x27;odham and Northeast Caucasian Ingush. All other Dardic languages, and more generally within Indo-Iranian, follow the subject-object-verb (SOV) pattern.

==Notes==
:1.The Khowar word for &#x27;earth&#x27; is more accurately represented, with tonality, as &quot;buúm&quot; rather than &quot;buum&quot;, where &quot;ú&quot; indicates a rising tone.
:2.The word &quot;drolid&quot; actually includes a Kashmiri half-vowel, which is difficult to render in the Urdu, Devnagri and Roman scripts alike. Sometimes, an umlaut is used when it occurs in conjunction with a vowel, so the word might be more accurately rendered as &quot;drölid&quot;.
:3.Sandhi rules in Sanskrit allow the combination of multiple neighboring words together into a single word: for instance, word-final &#x27;ah&#x27; plus word-initial &#x27;a&#x27; merge into &#x27;o&#x27;. In actual Sanskrit literature, with the effects of sandhi, this sentence would be expected to appear as &quot;Eṣá ékóśvósti&quot;. Also, word-final &#x27;a&#x27; is Sanskrit is a schwa, (similar to the ending &#x27;e&#x27; in the German name, Nietzsche), so e.g. the second word is pronounced . Pitch accent is indicated with an acute accent in the case of the older Vedic language, which was inherited from Proto-Indo-European.
:4.Hindi-Urdu, and other non-Dardic Indo-Aryan languages, also sometimes utilize a &quot;verb second&quot; order (similar to Kashmiri and English) for dramatic effect. &quot;Yeh ek ghoṛā hain&quot; is the normal conversational form in Hindi-Urdu. &quot;Yeh hain ek ghoṛā&quot; is also grammatically correct but indicates a dramatic revelation or other surprise. This dramatic form is often used in news headlines in Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi and other Indo-Aryan languages.

<doc id="740008" wikidata="Q2661397" url="?curid=740008" title="India and weapons of mass destruction">
<text>India possesses nuclear weapons and previously developed chemical weapons. Although India has not released any official statements about the size of its nuclear arsenal, recent estimates suggest that India has 172 nuclear weapons and has produced enough weapons-grade plutonium for up to 200 nuclear weapons. In 1999, India was estimated to have of separated reactor-grade plutonium, with a total amount of of civilian plutonium, enough for approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons. India has conducted nuclear weapons tests in a pair of series namely &quot;Pokhran I&quot; and &quot;Pokhran II&quot;.

India is a member of three multilateral export control regimes — the Missile Technology Control Regime, Wassenaar Arrangement and Australia Group. It has signed and ratified the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention. India is also a subscribing state to the Hague Code of Conduct. India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. India previously possessed chemical weapons, but voluntarily destroyed its entire stockpile in 2009 — one of the seven countries to meet the OPCW extended deadline.

India maintains a &quot;no first use&quot; nuclear policy and has developed a nuclear triad capability as a part of its &quot;credible minimum deterrence&quot; doctrine.

== Biological weapons ==
India has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and pledges to abide by its obligations. There is no clear evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, that directly points toward an offensive BW program. India does possess the scientific capability and infrastructure to launch an offensive BW program. In terms of delivery, India also possesses the capability to produce aerosols and has numerous potential delivery systems ranging from crop dusters to sophisticated ballistic missiles. No information exists in the public domain suggesting interest by the Indian government in the delivery of biological agents by these or any other means. To reiterate the latter point, in October 2002, then-President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam asserted that &quot;India will not make biological weapons. It is cruel to human beings&quot;.

== Chemical weapons ==
In 1992, India signed the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), becoming one of the original signatories of the CWC in 1993, and ratified it on 2 September 1996. According to India&#x27;s ex-Army Chief General Sundarji, a country having the capability of making nuclear weapons does not need to have chemical weapons, since the dread of chemical weapons could be created only in those countries that do not have nuclear weapons. Others suggested that the fact that India has found chemical weapons dispensable highlighted its confidence in the conventional weapons system at its command.

In June 1997, India declared its stock of chemical weapons (1,045 tonnes of sulphur mustard). By the end of 2006, India had destroyed more than 75 percent of its chemical weapons/material stockpile and was granted an extension for destroying the remaining stocks by April 2009 and was expected to achieve 100 percent destruction within that time frame. India informed the United Nations in May 2009 that it had destroyed its stockpile of chemical weapons in compliance with the international Chemical Weapons Convention. With this India has become the third country after South Korea and Albania to do so. This was cross-checked by inspectors of the United Nations.

India has an advanced commercial chemical industry, and produces the bulk of its chemicals for domestic consumption. It is also widely acknowledged that India has an extensive civilian chemical and pharmaceutical industry and annually exports considerable quantities of chemicals to countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Taiwan.

== Nuclear weapons ==
As early as 26 June 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru, soon to be India&#x27;s first Prime Minister, announced: 

Nehru pursued a policy of formally foregoing nuclear weapons while at the same time constructing a civilian nuclear energy program and by extension the capability to make a nuclear bomb. This policy was motivated by a conventional weapons superiority over its rivals Pakistan and China. India built its first research reactor in 1956 and its first plutonium reprocessing plant by 1964. India&#x27;s nuclear programme can trace its origins to March 1944 and its three-stage efforts in technology were established by Homi Jehangir Bhabha when he founded the nuclear research center, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

India&#x27;s loss to China in a brief Himalayan border war in October 1962, provided the New Delhi government impetus for developing nuclear weapons as a means of deterring potential Chinese aggression. By 1964 India was in a position to develop nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri opposed developing nuclear weapons but fell under intense political pressure, including elements within the ruling Indian National Congress. India was also unable to obtain security guarantees from either the United States or the Soviet Union. As a result, Shastri announced that India would pursue the capability of what it called &quot;peaceful nuclear explosions&quot; that could be weaponized in the future.

India first tested a nuclear device in 1974 (code-named &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;), under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a peaceful nuclear explosion. The test used plutonium produced in the Canadian-supplied CIRUS reactor, and raised concerns that nuclear technology supplied for peaceful purposes could be diverted to weapons purposes. This also stimulated the early work of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. During the 1970s and the 1980s Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai, and Rajiv Gandhi opposed weaponizing its nuclear program beyond PNE and theoretical research. In 1982, Indira Gandhi refused to allow the Defence Research and Development Organisation to develop active nuclear weapons but also approved the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme that would develop missiles to deliver a nuclear warhead if India developed one. India also supported international nuclear non-proliferation and arms control efforts.

The situation changed again in the late 1980s after the 1987 Brasstacks crisis and the beginning of the Pakistani nuclear weapons program. In 1989, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi gave Defense Secretary Naresh Chandra approval to develop the bomb. Chandra continued the program through successive governments in the 1990s after Gandhi lost power in the 1989 general election. India most likely completed weaponized nuclear warheads around 1994. India performed further nuclear tests in 1998 (code-named &quot;Operation Shakti&quot;) under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In 1998, as a response to the continuing tests, the United States and Japan imposed sanctions on India, which have since been lifted.

===Neutron bombs===
R Chidambaram, who headed India&#x27;s Pokhran-II nuclear tests, said in a 1999 interview with the Press Trust of India that India is capable of producing a neutron bomb.

===India&#x27;s no-first-use policy===
India has a declared nuclear no-first-use policy and is in the process of developing a nuclear doctrine based on &quot;credible minimum deterrence.&quot; In August 1999, the Indian government released a draft of the doctrine which asserts that nuclear weapons are solely for deterrence and that India will pursue a policy of &quot;retaliation only&quot;. The document also maintains that India &quot;will not be the first to initiate a nuclear first strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail&quot; and that decisions to authorize the use of nuclear weapons would be made by the Prime Minister or his &#x27;designated successor(s)&#x27;. According to the NRDC, despite the escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan in 2001–2002, India remained committed to its nuclear no-first-use policy.

India&#x27;s Strategic Nuclear Command was formally established in 2003, with an Indian Air Force officer, Air Marshal Tej Mohan Asthana, as the Commander-in-Chief. The Joint Services SNC is the custodian of all of India&#x27;s nuclear weapons, missiles and defense assets. It is also responsible for executing all aspects of India&#x27;s nuclear policy. However, the civil leadership, in the form of the CCS (Cabinet Committee on Security) is the only body authorised to order a nuclear strike against another offending strike. The National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon reiterated a policy of &quot;no first use&quot; against nuclear weapon states and &quot;non-use against non-nuclear weapon states&quot; in a speech on the occasion of Golden Jubilee celebrations of National Defence College in New Delhi on 21 October 2010, a doctrine Menon said reflected India&#x27;s &quot;strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence. In April 2013 Shyam Saran, convener of the National Security Advisory Board, affirmed that regardless of the size of a nuclear attack against India, be it a miniaturised version or a &quot;big&quot; missile, India will retaliate massively to inflict unacceptable damage.

In 2016, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar questioned the no-first-use policy, asking why India should &quot;bind&quot; itself when it is a &quot;responsible nuclear power&quot;. Later he clarified that this was his personal opinion. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in 2019 said that in the future, India&#x27;s no-first-use policy might change depending upon the &quot;circumstances&quot;. In a January 2022 statement, however, the Ministry of External Affairs reiterated India&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;maintaining a credible minimum deterrence based on a No First Use posture and non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states&quot;.

===Indian nuclear triad===

India&#x27;s nuclear triad is a military force structure that includes three parts:

* Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs): Land-based nuclear missiles
* Submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs): Nuclear-missile-armed submarines
* Strategic bombers: Aircraft with nuclear bombs and missiles 

The purpose of India&#x27;s nuclear triad is to increase nuclear deterrence by reducing the chance of an enemy destroying all of India&#x27;s nuclear forces in a first-strike attack. This ensures that India can still launch a second strike.
====Air-launched nuclear weapons====

Nuclear-armed fighter-bombers were India&#x27;s first and only nuclear-capable strike force until 2003 when the country&#x27;s first land-based nuclear ballistic missiles were fielded.

In addition to their ground-attack role, it is believed that the Dassault Mirage 2000s and SEPECAT Jaguars of the Indian Air Force are able to provide a secondary nuclear-strike role. The SEPECAT Jaguar was designed to be able to carry and deploy nuclear weapons and the Indian Air Force has identified the jet as being capable of delivering Indian nuclear weapons. The most likely delivery method would be the use of bombs that are free-falling and unguided.

Three airbases with four squadrons of Mirage 2000H (about 16 aircraft with 16 bombs from 1st and 7th squadrons of the 40th Wing at Maharajpur Air Force Station) and Jaguar IS/IB (about 32 aircraft with 32 bombs from one squadron each at Ambala Air Force Station and Gorakhpur Air Force Station) aircraft are believed to be assigned the nuclear strike role.

====Land-based ballistic missiles====

The estimated 68 nuclear warheads of land-based nuclear weapons of India are under the control of and deployed by the Strategic Forces Command, using a variety of vehicles and launching silos. They currently consist of six different types of ballistic missiles, the Agni-I, the Agni-II, Agni-III, Agni-IV, Agni-V, Agni-P, and the Army&#x27;s variant of the Prithvi missile family – the Prithvi-I. However, the Prithvi missiles are less useful for delivering nuclear weapons because they have a shorter range and must be deployed very close to the India–Pakistan border. Additional variants of the Agni missile series have recently been inducted including the most recent, the Agni-IV and the Agni-V, which is currently being deployed. Agni-VI is also under development, with an estimated range of 10,000–12,000 km and features such as Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) or Maneuverable reentry vehicles (MARVs).

====Sea-based ballistic missiles====

The Indian Navy has developed two sea-based delivery systems for nuclear weapons, completing Indian ambitions for a nuclear triad, which may have been deployed in 2015.

The first is a submarine-launched system consisting of at least four 6,000-tonne (nuclear-powered) ballistic missile submarines of the &quot;Arihant&quot; class. The first vessel, INS &quot;Arihant&quot;, was commissioned in August 2016. She is the first nuclear-powered submarine to be built by India. A CIA report claimed that Russia provided technological aid to the naval nuclear propulsion program. The submarines will be armed with up to 12 Sagarika (K-15) missiles armed with nuclear warheads. Sagarika is a submarine-launched ballistic missile with a range of 700 km. This missile has a length of 8.5 meters, weighs seven tonnes and can carry a pay load of up to 50 kg. Sagarika has already been test-fired from an underwater pontoon, but now DRDO is planning a full-fledged test of the missile from a submarine and for this purpose may use the services of the Russian Navy. India&#x27;s DRDO is also working on a submarine-launched ballistic missile version of the Agni-III missile, known as the Agni-III SL. According to Indian defence sources, the Agni-III SL will have a range of . The new missile will complement the older and less capable Sagarika submarine-launched ballistic missiles. However, the &quot;Arihant&quot; class ballistic missile submarines will be only capable of carrying a maximum of four Agni-III SL.

The second is a ship-launched system based around the short-range ship-launched Dhanush ballistic missile (a variant of the Prithvi missile). It has a range of around 300 km. In the year 2000, the short-range missile was test-fired from INS &quot;Subhadra&quot; (a &quot;Sukanya&quot; class patrol craft). INS &quot;Subhadra&quot; was modified for the test and the missile was launched from the reinforced helicopter deck. The results were considered partially successful. In 2004, the missile was again tested from INS &quot;Subhadra&quot; and this time the results were reported successful. In December 2005 the missile was tested again, but this time from the destroyer INS &quot;Rajput&quot;. The test was a success with the missile hitting the land based target.

=== Thermonuclear weapons ===

On 11 May 1998, India announced that it had detonated a thermonuclear bomb in its Operation Shakti tests (&quot;Shakti-I&quot;, specifically, in Hindi the word &#x27;Shakti&#x27; means power). Samar Mubarakmand, a Pakistani nuclear physicist, asserted that if Shakti-I had been a thermonuclear test, the device had failed to fire. However, Harold M. Agnew, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said that India&#x27;s assertion of having detonated a staged thermonuclear bomb was very much believable. India says that their thermonuclear device was tested at a controlled yield of because of the proximity of the Khetolai village at about , to ensure that the houses in that village do not suffer significant damage. Another cited reason was that radioactivity released from yields significantly more than 45 Kilotons might not have been contained fully. After the Pokhran-II tests, Rajagopala Chidambaram, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India said that India has the capability to build thermonuclear bombs of any yield at will.

The yield of India&#x27;s hydrogen bomb test remains highly debatable among the Indian science community and international scholars. The question of politicisation and disputes between Indian scientists further complicated the matter.

In an interview in August 2009, the director for the 1998 test site preparations, K. Santhanam claimed that the yield of the thermonuclear explosion was lower than expected and that India should therefore not rush into signing the CTBT. Other Indian scientists involved in the test have disputed K. Santhanam&#x27;s claim, arguing that Santhanam&#x27;s claims are unscientific. British seismologist Roger Clarke argued that the magnitudes suggested a combined yield of up to , consistent with the Indian announced total yield of . U.S. seismologist Jack Evernden has argued that for correct estimation of yields, one should &#x27;account properly for geological and seismological differences between test sites.

However, India officially maintains that it can build thermonuclear weapons of various yields up to around based on the Shakti-1 thermonuclear test.

== International response ==

India is not a signatory to either the NPT or the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) but did accede to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in October 1963. Journalist, conspiracy theorist, and holocaust denier Gregory Douglas claims CIA officer Robert Crowley told him in an interview in 1993 that India&#x27;s pursuit of the programme disturbed the United States and that the CIA assassinated Prime Minister Shastri and Homi Bhabha in 1966. India is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and four of its 17 nuclear reactors are subject to IAEA safeguards. India announced its lack of intention to accede to the NPT as late as 1997 by voting against the paragraph of a General Assembly Resolution which urged all non-signatories of the treaty to accede to it at the earliest possible date. India voted against the UN General Assembly resolution endorsing the CTBT, which was adopted on 10 September 1996. India objected to the lack of provision for universal nuclear disarmament &quot;within a time-bound framework.&quot; India also demanded that the treaty ban laboratory simulations. In addition, India opposed the provision in Article XIV of the CTBT that requires India&#x27;s ratification for the treaty to enter into force, which India argued was a violation of its sovereign right to choose whether it would sign the treaty. In early February 1997, Foreign Minister I. K. Gujral reiterated India&#x27;s opposition to the treaty, saying that &quot;India favors any step aimed at destroying nuclear weapons, but considers that the treaty in its current form is not comprehensive and bans only certain types of tests.&quot;

In August 2008, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved a safeguards agreement with India under which the former will gradually gain access to India&#x27;s civilian nuclear reactors. In September 2008, the Nuclear Suppliers Group granted India a waiver to access civilian nuclear technology and fuel from other countries. The implementation of this waiver makes India the only known country with nuclear weapons which is not a party to the NPT but is still allowed to carry out nuclear commerce with the rest of the world.

Since the implementation of the NSG waiver, India has signed nuclear deals with several countries including France, United States, Mongolia, Namibia, Kazakhstan and Australia while the framework for similar deals with Canada and the United Kingdom are also being prepared.

== Domestic legislation ==
India has several laws in whole or partial measure that deal with the regulation of weapons of mass destruction. They include the Weapons of Mass Destruction and their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities) Act of 2005. In April 2022 a bill was tabled to amend the 2005 act to include the financing of proliferation.

<text>Lucius Robinson (November 4, 1810 – March 23, 1891) was an American lawyer and politician. He was the 26th governor of New York from 1877 to 1879.

==Early life==
Lucius Robinson was born on November 4, 1810, in Windham, New York, to Mary and Eli P. Robinson. His father was a farmer. He was descended from John Robinson, a Puritan clergyman. He graduated from Delaware Academy in Delhi, New York. Afterwards he studied law in the offices of Erastus Root and Amasa J. Parker, was admitted to the bar in October 1832.

==Career==
Robinson began practicing law in Catskill. He was district attorney of Greene County from 1837 to 1839. Then he removed to New York City and became a member of Tammany Hall. In 1843, he was appointed master in chancery and then entered a law partnership with David Codwise. He was reappointed as master in chancery in 1846 by Governor Silas Wright and continued until the Courts of Chancery were abolished by the new constitution. During this time, he was a contributor to the editorial page of &quot;The New York Sun&quot;. In 1855, he moved to Chemung County. He joined the Republican Party when it was founded, and was a member of the New York State Assembly (Chemung Co.) in 1860 and 1861.

Robinson was New York State Comptroller from 1862 to 1865. In 1861, he was elected on the Union ticket nominated by Republicans and War Democrats. He received a majority of 108,201 votes in the election. In 1863 he was defeated for re-nomination at the Union state convention, but the nominated candidate refused to run, and the Republican State Committee put Robinson back on the ticket, and he was re-elected. After the war he joined the Democratic Party again, and was re-nominated for comptroller on the Democratic ticket, but this time was defeated by the Republican candidate Thomas Hillhouse. After his defeat he resumed the practice of law. In 1871–72 he was a member of the New York State Constitutional Commission.

He was a director of the Erie Railroad, and was acting president of the company while the president, Peter H. Watson, was travelling about Europe. In 1875, he was again elected state comptroller, defeating the Republican candidate, former United States Treasurer Francis E. Spinner. Robinson was a delegate to the 1876 Democratic National Convention and supported Samuel J. Tilden for president. While serving as comptroller, he was elected governor, defeating Edwin D. Morgan by nearly a 40,000 majority. He was in office from 1877 to 1879, the first governor to serve a three-year term after the amendment to the state constitution in 1874. As governor, he opposed Tammany Hall vigorously, which led the Tammany leader John Kelly to have himself nominated for governor by Tammany Hall at the next election in 1879, with the intention to split the Democratic vote, and so defeat Robinson. This happened, and the Republican candidate Alonzo B. Cornell was elected governor with fewer votes than Robinson and Kelly together. He called the new New York State Capitol &quot;the public calamity&quot;.

==Personal life==
Robinson married Eunice Osborn, daughter of Bennet Osborn, on October 24, 1833. They had a son, David C. After retiring as governor, he moved to Elmira.

Robinson died from pneumonia on March 23, 1891, at his home on Maple Avenue in Elmira. He was buried at the Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira.

==Legacy==
In 1883, the park commissioners named an entrance to Niagara Falls State Park after Robinson.

<text>The Kanchanaburi War Cemetery (known locally as the Don-Rak War Cemetery) is the main prisoner of war (POW) cemetery for victims of Japanese imprisonment while building the Burma Railway. It is on the main road, Saeng Chuto Road, through the town of Kanchanaburi, Thailand, adjacent to an older Chinese cemetery. The cemetery contains 6,982 graves of British, Australian and Dutch prisoners of war, of whom 6,858 have been identified.

== History ==
The cemetery was designed by Colin St Clair Oakes and is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It is located near the former prisoner of war base camp of Kanchanaburi. There are 6,858 POWs buried there, mostly British, Australian, and Dutch. It contains the remains of prisoners buried beside the south section of the railway from Bangkok to Nieke (Niki Niki), excepting those identified as Americans, whose remains were repatriated.

There are 1,896 Dutch war graves, 5,085 Commonwealth graves and one non-war grave. Two graves contain the ashes of 300 men who were cremated after a cholera outbreak in Niki Niki. The Kanchanaburi Memorial gives the names of 11 from India who are buried in Muslim cemeteries.

Nearby, across a side road, is the Thailand–Burma Railway Centre about the railway and the prisoners who built it. There is also a Dutch Roman Catholic church nearby – Beata Mundi Regina.

<text>Felicia Lily Dobson (born February 28, 1985) is a Canadian singer. Born in Toronto, Ontario, she began performing as a teenager, during which time she received and refused an offer from Jive Records for a recording contract. Dobson signed with Island/Def Jam soon after and released her self-titled debut album (2003), which saw the success of the singles &quot;Bye Bye Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go (Girls and Boys)&quot; on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and for which she received two Juno Award nominations.

Dobson&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Sunday Love&quot; was originally scheduled for release in 2005, but after complications during production, its mainstream release was cancelled and she left her record label due to creative differences (later made available digitally in 2012). She was re-signed to Island Records during production of her third studio album &quot;Joy&quot; (2010), whose singles &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Stuttering&quot; saw continued success in Canada.

==Early life==
Dobson was born on February 28, 1985, in Scarborough, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. Dobson&#x27;s mother is of English, Dutch, First Nations, and Irish ancestry and her father is of Jamaican heritage. She went to high school at Wexford Collegiate Institute. During her childhood, she took singing lessons at the New Conservatory of Music in Agincourt, Scarborough to improve her singing. Fefe Dobson graduated from Heritage Park Public School.

Dobson began sending demo tapes – recorded on a home karaoke machine – to many recording companies in North America when she was 11 years old. Then at the age of 13, she started playing the piano.
Before Dobson was signed, she said that she had been stereotyped as a contemporary R&amp;B or popular music singer instead of a rock musician due to her race, often being compared to Brandy Norwood and Britney Spears.
Dobson started writing music at the age of 13 years, and the company Jive Records attempted to develop her as a popular musician, which she eventually refused. After that experience, Dobson met Jay Levine and contracted with Nelly Furtado&#x27;s manager Chris Smith. Smith arranged showcases with several recording companies. Universal Music Canada president Randy Lennox showed interest in her, and persuaded Island Def Jam CEO Lyor Cohen and his manager of A&amp;R, Jeff Fenster, to fly to Toronto for another showcase. Dobson played a showcase for Island/Def Jam; about 30 seconds into the first song – a punk thrash track about longing, titled &quot;Stupid Little Love Song&quot; – the executives contracted her.

==Music career==
===2003–2008: &quot;Fefe Dobson&quot; and &quot;Sunday Love&quot;===

Dobson&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released December 9, 2003, by Island Records, and sold 307,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers Albums Chart. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Bye Bye Boyfriend&quot;, &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Everything&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go (Girls and Boys)&quot;. Two of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Everything&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, were used in the film &quot;The Perfect Score&quot;. During much of 2004, Dobson promoted her debut album, performing live on the program &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and appearing in numerous magazines. She was also the opening act of Justin Timberlake&#x27;s European tour. That July, she released the single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go (Girls and Boys)&quot;, which was featured in a Tommy Hilfiger commercial featuring the singer. The album was later reissued with the single added. Dobson also had a new song, &quot;If You Walk Away&quot;, on the soundtrack of &quot;Raising Helen&quot;. Dobson was an endorser for the Got Milk? organization.

In April 2005, Dobson was nominated for two Juno Awards, Pop Album of the Year and New Artist of the Year. During the summer of 2005, Dobson was in a public service ad: &quot;Make Poverty History&quot;, which brings awareness to child poverty worldwide.

In 2005, Dobson released the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Go to Your Head&quot; followed by &quot;This Is My Life&quot; the following year. When both singles failed to chart, Island Records dropped her from the label and canceled the major label release of Dobson&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Sunday Love&quot;. &quot;My real good fans, my hardcore fans, have it, so that&#x27;s most important,&quot; Dobson said, referring to the album leaking on the internet. &quot;But instead of sitting there and being depressed and begging people for the record, I went back to the studio, got people that I knew, friends that I knew, and I started again.&quot; &quot;Sunday Love&quot; eventually received a wide digital release on December 18, 2012. 
One song from the album, &quot;Be Strong&quot;, featured on the soundtrack for the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Boy Girl Thing&quot;.

&quot;Start All Over&quot;, a song co-written by Dobson and featured her background vocals, was recorded by Miley Cyrus for her album &quot;Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus&quot; (2007) and was released as a single, reaching number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop 100. &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Go to Your Head&quot; was covered by Rockett Queen on their album &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; (2008) and Jordin Sparks on her second album &quot;Battlefield&quot; (2009). Shortly after Sparks&#x27; album was released Dobson said, &quot;She did kind of, like, a more R&amp;B version of it, which I think is really nice, actually.&quot; Sparks&#x27; version was released as a single in the UK on January 4, 2010.
The track &quot;As a Blonde&quot; was covered on the Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene album &quot;Kiss &amp; Tell&quot; (2009). 

===2009–2012: &quot;Joy&quot;===
On August 11, 2009, Dobson presented a showcase performance at the Mercury Lounge in New York City.

&quot;Joy&quot;, Dobson&#x27;s third studio album, was released on November 22, 2010, after taking almost four years to complete. The album was preceded by the release of the two buzz singles &quot;Watch Me Move&quot; and &quot;I Want You&quot;, which were then followed-up by the three top 20 singles &quot;Ghost&quot;, &quot;Stuttering&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Breathe&quot;. The singer performed her single &quot;Stuttering&quot; on the November 10, 2010, broadcast of The CW Television Network series, &quot;Hellcats&quot;. She released the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Breathe&quot; in March 2011. It peaked at number 19 on the Canadian Hot 100.

She performed at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival in September 2010.
That year, Dobson co-wrote Selena Gomez &amp; The Scene&#x27;s single &quot;Round &amp; Round&quot;, from their second studio album, &quot;A Year Without Rain&quot;.

=== 2013–present: Single releases and &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot; ===
On January 22, 2013, Dobson announced that recording had begun for her fourth studio album, later revealed to be titled &quot;Firebird&quot;. The album&#x27;s intended lead single &quot;Legacy&quot; was released on August 6, 2013, while the song &quot;Celebrate&quot; was released February 11, 2014. &quot;Firebird&quot; did not see a release and the project was canceled.

In early July 2013, Dobson got engaged to American rapper Yelawolf; the pair were married on September 27, 2019, in Nashville, Tennessee. On April 29, 2014, Dobson performed live during the Count Me In conference global broadcast, filmed at the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts.

In early 2022, Dobson confirmed her return to music with the single &quot;FCKN IN LOVE&quot;, which was released on 25 February 2022. In 2023, she participated in an all-star recording of Serena Ryder&#x27;s single &quot;What I Wouldn&#x27;t Do&quot;, which was released as a charity single to benefit Kids Help Phone&#x27;s Feel Out Loud campaign for youth mental health. Dobson released her fourth studio album, &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot;, on September 29, 2023. It was preceded by the single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Love Him (And Love You Too)&quot;.

==Artistry==

===Musical style===
Fefe Dobson&#x27;s self-titled debut album is generally pop-rock, as well as some traces of punk music. Several songs on the album are also in an acoustic format, stripped down to just Dobson and the guitar. The music was different from most music put out at the time, such as recent releases by Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. In fact, Dobson originally signed with Jive Records, who intended to make her the next big pop star. However, Dobson didn&#x27;t want to be a pop-star and wanted to make her own type of music, and quickly left the label. On Dobson&#x27;s second album &quot;Joy&quot;, she worked with producers David Lichens, Jon Levine, Howard Benson and Bob Ezrin - living up to the portraits of her heroes she first hung during the recording of her first album: Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, Coldplay, The Vines and Jeff Buckley. Dobson co-wrote most of the songs on the album - usually composing on guitar, her instrument of choice. &quot;I play the few chords that I know,&quot; she says. &quot;I try to write melodies off the same chords. &quot;Joy&quot; is written with about three chords, and an extra one in the bridge.&quot; Sonically the album was rooted alternative rock.

===Influences===
Dobson has said that John Lennon and Judy Garland are her primary musical influences, and that her biggest musical inspiration growing up was Michael Jackson: &quot;I swore I was Michael [Jackson]. Then I found out I wasn&#x27;t Michael [Jackson] and it broke my heart.&quot; She also mentions Janet Jackson as a primary influence. At the same time, she went to &quot;every &#x27;N Sync concert there was.&quot;
Dobson indicated that she would like to work with Jack White, the White Stripes/Raconteurs frontman, because she admires him for his ability to make his ragged rock music become radio-style.

<doc id="740046" wikidata="Q7696522" url="?curid=740046" title="Telephone numbers in Australia">
<text>The Australian telephone numbering plan governs the allocation of telephone numbers in Australia. It has changed many times, the most recent major reorganisation by the Australian Communications and Media Authority taking place between 1994 and 1998.

== Overview ==
For landline telephony, Australia is geographically divided into four areas, three of which cover more than one state or territory. All local telephone numbers within the four areas have eight digits, consisting (mainly) of a four-digit exchange code and a four-digit local line number. The national significant number consists of a single-digit area code followed by the local eight-digit number, a total of nine digits. Calling within Australia a landline telephone in an area other than that of the caller, the telephone number is preceded by the Australian trunk prefix &quot;0&quot; and the area code: 0x xxxx xxxx.

*00 International and Emergency access (see below for details)
*01 Alternative phone services
**014 Satellite phones
**0163 Pager numbers
**0198 Data numbers (e.g. 0198 308 888 is the dial-up PoP number for Telstra) 
*02 Geographic: Central East region (NSW, ACT, small parts of Victoria)
*03 Geographic: South-east region (VIC, TAS)
*04 Digital Mobile services (3G, 4G, 5G and GSM)
*0550 Location Independent Communication Services
*07 Geographic: North-east region (QLD)
*08 Geographic: Central and West region (SA, NT, WA, small part of NSW)
*1 Non-geographic numbers (mostly for domestic use only; see below for details)

The current numbering plan would appear to be sufficient to cope with potential increase in demand for services for quite some time to come. The &quot;06&quot; and &quot;09&quot; area codes are unused. In addition, each other area code has large number ranges unallocated.

When dialling from outside Australia, after dialling the appropriate international access code, it is necessary to dial the country code for Australia (61) followed by the nine digit national significant number. (The + symbol is used to represent the International Access Code, e.g. &quot;+61 3 xxxx xxxx&quot; for a number in Victoria/Tasmania or +61 4xx xxx xxx for a mobile number). Some numbers beginning with a &quot;1&quot; may be dialled without any replacement, after dialling the required international access code and the country code.

Australian local numbers have eight digits, conventionally written in the form &quot;xxxx xxxx&quot;. Mobile numbers are written in the form of ten digits, when dialed within Australia, the &quot;0&quot; must be included, and &quot;4&quot;, which indicates the service required is a mobile number. Mobile numbers are conventionally written &quot;04xx xxx xxx&quot;. If a landline or mobile number is written where it may be viewed by an international audience (e.g. in an email signature or on a website) then the number is often written as &quot;+61 x xxxx xxxx&quot; or &quot;+61 4xx xxx xxx&quot; respectively.

The Australian national trunk access code, 0, is not used for calls originated from locations outside Australia.

===Fixed-line telephone numbers===

Within Australia, dialing a number in another area requires dialing the trunk code &quot;0&quot;, followed by the area code, and then the local number.

In major centres, the first four digits specify the CCA (Call Collection Area, also known as an exchange), and the remaining digits specify a number at that exchange, up to 10,000 of which may be connected. Smaller exchanges in more remote areas may have fewer than 100 connected numbers.

To access numbers in the same area, it is necessary only to dial the eight digits concerned. To access a number in another area it is first necessary to dial the trunk code of 0, followed by the area code (2, 3, 7 or 8) and then the specific local number.

The area codes do not exactly match state/territory boundaries. Notable are the part of New South Wales around Broken Hill (a large part of the state&#x27;s area but less than 1% of its population), which uses (08) 80xx numbers, and Wodonga, which is in Victoria but is within the New South Wales (02) area code. Similarly New South Wales border towns including Deniliquin and Buronga are within the South East (Victorian) (03) area code, and Tweed Heads within the North East (Queensland) (07) area code. Physical exchanges can be allocated one or more prefixes and modern technology allows sub-sets of these number ranges to be allocated to switching entities physically located at a distance from the exchange in which their controlling terminal is located. (Thus, the concept of what a &quot;telephone exchange&quot; is can become somewhat blurred.)

Landlines use an open dialling plan: if the caller&#x27;s phone shares the same area code as the called phone, the area code &quot;may&quot; be omitted. For example, a call from the number (02) 5551 5678, to the number (02) 7010 1111, will be connected if the caller dials only 7010 1111. Similarly, a person who dials 7010 5678 on a land-line or mobile phone in Melbourne (i.e., within the 03 area) will be connected to 03 7010 5678. For this reason, landline numbers are often specified without the area code. If a person&#x27;s number and the destination number share the same area code, then the area code is not required, even if it is not a local (untimed) call.

However, the full international number must always be dialled, since the Australian telephone network has the capability to recognise when the destination required is either international, in a different national area or within the local area and to switch and charge the call accordingly. Thus, it is strongly recommended that telephone numbers should be stored in mobile phones in the form of the full international number, should the owner of the phone be likely to use the phone concerned in an area away from home, either within Australia or internationally.

===Mobile phones===
Within Australia, mobile phone numbers begin with 04 – the Australian national trunk code 0, plus the mobile indicator 4 – followed by eight digits. This is generally written as 04XX XXX XXX within Australia, or as +61 4XX XXX XXX for an international audience. This format is the result of mobile carriers advertising numbers in such a way so as to clearly identify the owning telco prior to mobile number portability, introduced on 25 September 2001. Prior to MNP, mobile operators generally reserved number ranges in blocks of 04 xy z.

The xy-digit codes (sometimes xy z) are allocated per network. Since the introduction of number portability, there is no longer a fixed relationship between the mobile phone number and the network it uses.

In 2015 the 05 prefix (other than 0550) was also reserved for digital mobile phones as a part of the Telecommunications Numbering Plan 2015. However, as of 2024 no numbers have been allocated with this prefix.

Within Australia, mobile numbers must always be dialed with all 10 digits, regardless of the caller&#x27;s location.

=== Notes ===
==List of non-geographic numbers==
===Mobile phone numbers (04, 05)===
Each mobile phone company is allocated numbers in blocks, which are listed below. However mobile number portability means an individual number might have been &quot;ported&quot;. There are also many MVNOs which use numbers from their wholesaler or might have their own ranges.

ACMA planned to introduce the &quot;05&quot; range for mobile numbers in 2017, when the &quot;04&quot; range was expected to be exhausted. So far, no such numbers have been introduced.

The numbers 0491 570 006, 0491 570 156, 0491 570 157, 0491 570 158, 0491 570 159, 0491 570 110, 0491 570 313, 0491 570 737, 0491 571 266, 0491 571 491, 0491 571 804, 0491 572 549, 0491 572 665, 0491 572 983, 0491 573 770, 0491 573 087, 0491 574 118, 0491 574 632, 0491 575 254, 0491 575 789, 0491 576 398, 0491 576 801, 0491 577 426, 0491 577 644, 0491 578 957, 0491 578 148, 0491 578 888, 0491 579 212 and 0491 579 760 are reserved for fictitious use.

===Satellite phone numbers (014)===
Numbers beginning with 014 are predominantly used for satellite services. Parts of the 014 prefix had previously been used as a 9 digit, AMPS mobile phone access code.

The 01471 prefix is the ten-digit replacement for the previous, nine-digit ITERRA satellite phone code 0071 (followed by 5 numbers). Prior to its use for ITERRA (and other satellite services). These numbers were allocated in March 1999.

Numbers beginning by 0145 are used for services utilised on the Optus network in Australia. This is predominantly used for MobileSat and Thuraya mobile satellite services. These numbers were allocated in December 1992: 222,000 with the rest &quot;spare&quot;.

The prefixes 0141, 0142, 0143, 0145 and 0147 are set aside for satellite systems; the rest of the 014 prefix range is currently not allocated to any other service type. There is not a lot of demand for these services, and many satellite phones now have normal mobile phone numbers (prefix 04), so it is not likely for the entire 014 range to be allocated to satellite services.

===Location independent communications service (0550)===
These numbers are designed for VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) systems, where they work like a fixed number but not allocated on a geographical level. It is possible that LICS numbers will be absorbed into mobile numbers in the future, as they provide similar features. Indeed, the July 2012 variation of the numbering plan allocated the rest of the 05 range to digital mobile numbering.

===Data numbers (0198)===
All calls to 0198 numbers are a &quot;local call&quot; cost like 13 and 1300 numbers but are used for Internet service provider access numbers. They are used both with dial-up modems and ISDN.

===Obsolete numbers===
Most numbers that are no longer used have been removed from the Telecommunications Numbering Plan 2015, whether in previous variations or in this complete replacement. (See below)

However, the 0163 prefix is still allocated for use with pagers. This was reduced from 016 in a variation to the previous numbering plan. As of March 2011 only 1000 numbers were allocated, and by the end of 2012 there were none allocated.

==List of non-geographic numbers (domestic use)==
The following codes are not generally dialable from international points, but used in domestic dialling:

*000 – Emergency (Police, Fire, Ambulance)
*106 – TTY emergency (for the hearing-impaired)
*11 – Community services
**1100 – Before You Dig Australia (to prevent inadvertent damage to underground cables or infrastructure)
**112 – Alternative access to Emergency Services (Police, Fire, Ambulance; diallable from GSM mobile phones only)
**119x – Information services (e.g. 1194 was time and 1196 was weather (both disabled from 1 October 2019))
*12 – Network services
**1221 – International faults reporting service
**1222 – Call costs and enquiries service
**1223 – Directory assistance
**1225 – International directory assistance
**123x – Premium operator services (e.g. 1234 is Sensis personal assistance)
**124xx – Other operator services (e.g. 12456 is Sensis Call Connect)
**125xxx – Telstra mobile services (e.g. 125111 is Telstra mobile customer service)
**1268x, 1268 xxxx and 1268 xxx xxx – Internal network services
**127 – Testing numbers (e.g. 12722123 reads your number from a Telstra line, 12723123 reads your number for an Optus line) (length varies), dial 12722199 then hang up and the call is returned by the exchange (used to test handset functionality)
**1282 – Call information service
**128xx – Call information service
*13 xx xx and 1300 xxx xxx – &quot;Local Rate&quot; calls, except for VoIP and mobile phone users
*1345 xxxx – Local rate calls (only used for back-to-base monitored alarm systems)
*14xx – Carrier override prefixes (e.g. 1411 is the override prefix for the Telstra network; see below for details)
*180 xxxx and 1800 xxx xxx – FreeCall
*183x – Caller identification override prefixes (1831 blocks caller-id sending while 1832 unblocks caller-id sending) 
*188 xxxx – Premium SMS (since moved to 19 range)
*189 xx – Calling card service
*19 xx xx and 19xx xxxx – Premium SMS
*190x xxx xxx – Premium rate services (usually 1902 and 1900)

Some notes:
*These numbers do not have a Trunk Access Code prefix (0).
*The 106 number is believed to be the first nationwide TTY emergency service in the world.
*13 xx xx, 1300 xxx xxx and 1800 xxx xxx numbers can provide source-based routing, used by organisations such as pizza chains that advertise one number nationwide that connects customers to their nearest store.
*Virtually all FreeCall numbers in use are 1800 xxx xxx, though some organisations do use the shorter 7-digit version.
*Some of these numbers &quot;are&quot; dialable from locations outside Australia. It is up to the individual owner to set this up correctly (for 13 and 18 numbers at least) (e.g. +61 13x xxx)
*911 will not re-route to triple zero as the prefix 911x has been allocated to landlines under the current numbering plan. 911 &quot;may&quot; redirect to 000 when using a mobile phone, like 112, but it is not encouraged as knowledge of these numbers causes confusion

===Emergency services numbers (000, 106, 112)===
000 is the primary emergency telephone number in Australia. Secondary emergency numbers are 106 (for use by the hearing impaired with a TTY terminal) and the international GSM mobile emergency telephone number 112.

Increased awareness of the 112 emergency number in Australia has led to the potential for confusion over which number to call in an emergency. As a secondary emergency number, 112 is not guaranteed to work from all technologies; most notably, it does not work from landlines. In order to encourage use of 000, mobile telephones imported commercially into Australia are required to be programmed to treat 000 in the same fashion as 112 (i.e. dialling with key lock enabled, use of any carrier, preferential routing, etc.). On older or privately imported (e.g. roaming from another country) telephones, 000 may not receive such preferential treatment.

=== Local Rate and FreeCall numbers (13, 180) ===
Australia uses the free call prefix 1800 for 10 digit freecall numbers. This is similar to the North American or NANPA prefix 1–800, but while in North America, the 1 is the long-distance or toll prefix and 800 is the area code; 1800 in Australia is itself a &quot;virtual area code&quot; (prior to the introduction of 8-digit numbers, the free call code was 008). There are also seven digit freecall numbers beginning with 180 – the only numbers currently allocated begin with 1802.

The 13 and 1300 numbers are known as Local Rate Numbers or SmartNumbers. They are also known as priority 13, and priority 1300 numbers. These work across large areas (potentially the whole of Australia) and charge the caller only a low cost, routing the call to the appropriate place in a given area. For example, a company could have the number 139999 and have the telephone company set it up so that calls made in Melbourne would route to their Melbourne number, calls made in Brisbane to their Brisbane number, and calls made anywhere else in Australia route to their Sydney number, all at a local charge cost to the caller. 13 numbers were not available before the introduction of the current 8-digit local numbering plan. Businesses looking for local callers tend to connect to a &quot;1300&quot; number. Note that these numbers are called &quot;Local Rate&quot; and not &quot;Local&quot; numbers, so do not necessarily cost the same as a local call: Indeed, many (landline and mobile) phone plans do not even include them in the &quot;included&quot; credit and/or charge them at a higher rate than &quot;normal&quot; numbers.

Though promoted as &quot;local call rate&quot; calls, calls to 13 and 1300 numbers cost more than a local call fee for those people using VoIP and having all local and national calls free.

1800, 1300 and 13 numbers are reverse charge networks. Other than the length of the number, the differences between a 13 number and a 1300 number is that the shorter number has a higher fee for the owner of the number: there should be no difference in cost to the caller. A call to an 1800 is free when dialled from a landline, and mobile phones since 2014. It depends on the individual mobile plan as how 13 and 1300 numbers are charged: all plans no longer charge for 1800 but 13 and 1300 may still be charged at a high rate, or outside included calls.

These numbers &quot;forward&quot; to a geographic or mobile number. The recipient is usually charged at a set rate per second for each call, depending on plan and destination.

===Premium numbers (19)===
190x (not to be confused with 0198) is the prefix for premium rate services (e.g. recorded information, competition lines, psychics, phone sex, etc.). (Prior to the introduction of 8-digit local numbers, the prefix was 0055.) 190 numbers incur a rate as charged by the provider – either at a per-minute rate (limited at $5.50 per minute) or a fixed rate (up to $38.50 per call). The latter method is most often used for fax-back services, where a timed charge is not appropriate. Costs of 190 calls for competitions involving chance are also often limited by state legislation to $0.55 per call. (In the previous numbering plan, 0055 numbers were limited to three bands: Premium Rate, Value Rate and Budget Rate, with per minute rates of $0.75, $0.60 and $0.40 respectively.)

Other numbers beginning with 19 are used for premium-rate SMS services. These were originally trialled using the 188 prefix. These can range from a standard SMS cost (usually 25c), up to 55c for competition use, to several dollars for other uses, such as unique bid auctions.

==International access==
The main international prefix is 0011. (E.164 international format is supported from phones with the ability to dial the &#x27;+&#x27; symbol.)

There are other codes for using a non-default carrier or a special plan:
* 0014 will route through the Primus network
* 0018 will route through the Telstra network
* 0019 will route through the Optus network

Formerly, 0015 would route through Telstra on a special mode for international faxing. Telstra has retired this code. The prefix 0018 was previously used by Telstra to offer international calls charged in 30-minute blocks, at a potential discount to the default per-minute charge; this offer was retired in October 2012.

Carrier selection codes (14xx) are now also used, and carrier pre-selection is widely used.

==Carrier selection codes==
These four-digit numbers are dialled before the destination number to complete and bill a call by a carrier other than the subscriber&#x27;s service provider. For example, to use TPG to call a number in Tokyo, Japan, subscribers would dial 1414 0011 81 3 xxxx xxxx, or to use Optus to call a number in Perth they would dial 1456 08 xxxx xxxx. It is not clear if all these prefixes will actually work. Not all carriers have interconnect agreements with each other

==Historical numbering plans==
===2010s===
Many old numbers were officially removed from the Telecommunications Numbering Plan in the 2015 version, whether in the replacement version or a previous variation.

* 018 AMPS phone numbers are completely removed.
* 0500 Personal Numbers are removed.
* Unused prefixes such as 114 mass calling service are removed.

===1990s===
0055 numbers were previously premium-rate numbers, but have been moved into 190 numbers before 1999.

The original toll-free area code was 008, but the format was changed to 1800.

Directory assistance used various numbers: 013 for local calls, 0175 for other national calls, and 0103 for international. The two domestic numbers have been replaced with 1223, while 0103 was replaced with 1225. Other numbers for directory assistance, often with a call connection option, exist depending on the carrier.

011 was initially the code for the operator, 0011 later became the international exit code.

014 was originally the number for the time, (later 1104), which was changed to 1194 in 1976.

0176 was originally the code for the operator when calling from a Public Telephone. It became the code for the reverse-charge call operator, which was moved to 12550. Alternatively 3rd-party companies exist. See Collect call#Australia

===1960s===

Up to this time, the maximum size of an Australian telephone number was six digits.

Until the early 1960s, the first one or two digits of telephone numbers in metropolitan areas were alphabetic, with each letter representing a distinct number on the telephone dial. Each one-letter or two-letter code signified an exchange within an urban area. Rural and regional areas typically relied on manual exchanges, or only one automatic exchange for the whole town, so rural and regional numbers did not feature these letter prefixes. The use of a letter-number combination also served as a memory aid as it was easier to remember than a string of digits in the days when such things were not as common.

Unlike the three (or fewer) letters associated with each of the numbers on the dials of telephones of the UK Director telephone system, which was used in London and other large British cities, Australia used a system of letters associated with the ten digits available on a telephone dial, where each of these letters were chosen because their &quot;name&quot; (when pronounced, in English) could not be confused with any of the other nine letters of the English/Latin alphabet which were also used.

Since the initial digits of 1 and 0 (ten) were not used, this gave the telephone company concerned up to 8 regions with main exchanges and up to ten sub-exchanges in each metropolitan area – a total of up to 80 individual exchanges of 10,000 numbers in each with up to only 800,000 individual &quot;numbers&quot; in any metropolitan area concerned. This limited capacity led to the need for a seven- or eight-digit numbering system, to allow for more &quot;numbers&quot; within a given area.

Because of the growth of the telephone network, Australia now has eight-digit telephone numbers within four areas.

This former alphanumeric scheme was significantly different from the current system used for SMS messages.

The former alphanumeric scheme was:

* A = 1;
* B = 2;
* F = 3;
* J = 4;
* L = 5;
* M = 6;
* U = 7;
* W = 8;
* X = 9;
* Y = 0

The letters did not relate to any exchange name. For example, the exchange prefix for Essendon was FU (which translated to 37 and later became the 37x [then 937x] exchange used by the whole City of Essendon [which became the City of Moonee Valley in late 1994]). Although Melbourne city numbers began with 6, it was only rarely, and probably by accident, that any other exchanges had matching letters. Numbers using the old alphanumeric scheme were written as ab.xxxx, for example FU 1234 (the actual train of digits sent to the phone was &quot;371234&quot;) or MW 5550 (&quot;685550&quot;). Seven-digit numbers started appearing as early as 1960, and were all numerical from the start. There were still some six-digit numbers and at least one five-digit number in Melbourne as late as 1989, but by the 1990s, they all had been converted to seven-digit numbers. Footscray used six-digit numbers in exchange code 68 until 1987, when they were changed to 687 or 689.

The old call back number was 199, and could be used on public payphones, and private numbers too. This was moved to a new number 12722199.

<text>Galveston Island ( ) is a barrier island on the Texas Gulf Coast in the United States, about southeast of Houston. The entire island, with the exception of Jamaica Beach, is within the city limits of the City of Galveston in Galveston County.

The island is about long and no more than wide at its widest point. The island is oriented generally northeast-southwest, with the Gulf of Mexico on the east and south, West Bay on the west, and Galveston Bay on the north. The island&#x27;s main access point from the mainland is Interstate Highway 45 which crosses the Galveston Causeway that crosses West Bay on the northeast side of the island.

The far north end of the island is separated from the Bolivar Peninsula by Galveston Harbor, the entrance to Galveston Bay and the Houston Ship Channel. Ferry service is available between Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula. The southern end of the island is separated from the mainland by San Luis Pass. The San Luis Pass-Vacek Toll Bridge connects the San Luis Pass Road on Galveston Island with the Bluewater Highway that leads south into the town of Surfside Beach.

The residents of the island (the non-tourists) classify themselves in two ways: born on the island (BOI) and islander by choice (IBC). “BOI” is cited in print from at least 1956 and “IBC” is cited in print from 1975.

==Education==
All residents are zoned to Ball High School.

Colleges and universities include:
*Galveston College (GC)
*Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston (TAMUG)
*University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)

==History==
At the time of European encounter, Akokisa and Karankawa indigenous Americans lived and camped on what became known as Galveston Island. Earlier cultures likely used it as well for seasonal fishing and hunting.

Historians believe the island is where Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his small party of around 80, made a brief stopover in November 1528, during his lengthy and notable survival odyssey. After returning to Spain in 1537, Cabeza de Vaca wrote an account of his eight years of traveling across what is now the US Southwest, first published in 1542 as &quot;La relación y comentarios&quot; (&quot;The Account and Commentaries&quot;), and in later editions retitled &quot;Naufragios y comentarios&quot; (&quot;Shipwrecks and Commentaries&quot;).

Jao de la Porta, along with his brother Morin, financed the first settlement by ethnic Europeans on Galveston Island in 1816. Jao de la Porta was born in Portugal of Jewish parentage; he became a trader in Texas. 
(De la Porta was named supercargo for the Karankawa Indian trade and later became a full-time trader.)

The privateer Jean Lafitte brought his men and followers from Louisiana to the island, naming his settlement &quot;Campeche&quot;, after the older settlement on the Yucatan Peninsula. For a few years, the island and the bay were their base for piracy and smuggling in slaves after the United States had ended its international slave trade in 1808. After attacking an American ship, Lafitte was forced in 1821 to leave by the US Navy.

With the advent of Mexican independence in 1821, and the Texas Revolution soon after in 1836, the Anglo-American population in the Republic of Texas began to grow rapidly. The island quickly became Texas&#x27; primary port and a destination for immigration. Following Texas&#x27; annexation by the United States in 1845, the island&#x27;s population soon surpassed the population of San Antonio. It became the state&#x27;s major population center, a title it would hold until nearly the end of the 19th century. Galveston for a time before the American Civil War was the largest cotton shipping port in the world and the second-largest port for immigration in the United States. In the mid-19th century, it was a major port of entry for the many Germans who entered the state.

During the Civil War, the Union army seized control of the island from the South for a few months during early 1863. Confederate forces commanded by John B. Magruder expelled them from the island, and the Confederates controlled it for the remainder of the war.

On September 8, 1900, the greatest natural disaster to ever strike the United States occurred at Galveston. In the early evening hours of September 8, the Galveston hurricane of 1900 came ashore, bringing with it a great storm surge that inundated most of Galveston Island and the city of Galveston. As a result, much of the city was destroyed, and at least 6,000 people were killed in a few hours.

Isaac M. Cline, the meteorologist in charge of the local Weather Bureau, lived on Galveston Island. Cline was aware of a storm in the Gulf based on previous reports from Florida. Although weather conditions were relatively calm on September 7, Cline observed the rough seas and the high waves that seemed to become more ominous by the hour. He sent a telegram to Washington, D.C., saying he thought a large part of the city was going to be underwater. He predicted a very heavy loss of life.

After the hurricane passed, the state and city constructed a seawall around the settled portion of the island. Some houses were razed, and the many new ones to be constructed were built on stilts. Sand dredged from nearby waterways was pumped into the area within the seawall. In time, the elevation of the eastern portion of the island was raised by as much as 17 ft (5.2 m).

<doc id="740056" wikidata="Q5452592" url="?curid=740056" title="First call vehicle">
<text>The first call vehicle is a vehicle used in the funeral service industry. This type of vehicle is used to pick up the remains of a recently deceased person, and transport that person to the funeral home for preparation. This initial pickup is called the &quot;first call&quot;, hence the name of these vehicles. While some funeral homes will use their hearse for these initial pickups, having vehicles specifically for first calls and using the hearse solely for funerals reduces wear on hearses and makes the first call process more discreet. Sometimes, when the procession portion of funeral protocol comes into play, First Call vehicles double as funeral yield vehicles, which grants the procession the right of way.

Today, the vehicles typically used for first call service are minivans. In some cases, funeral homes purchase minivans that have been converted into first call vehicles by the same companies that produce hearses. In other cases, general purpose minivans are purchased without the rear seats installed. 

In the United States, larger SUVs such as the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Excursion have been employed. Their large wheelbase, pickup truck-derived chassis and larger engines make them popular, well suited to their purpose and requiring little alteration. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, full-sized station wagons such as the Chevrolet Caprice, Buick Roadmaster and Ford LTD were popular options as well. Conversion on these ranged from tinting or blacking-out the rear windows, and installing a metal deck (or sometimes, just bars) to secure the stretcher or casket, to having the rear section modified as a landau and the installation of a casket tray, similar to a hearse. Many of these remain in service.

Frequently, older or retired hearses are employed as a first call vehicle. This is usually more economical for the funeral home when a new hearse is purchased, as opposed to purchasing a second new vehicle.

The first call vehicle is sometimes operated by an outside company that has contracts with various mortuaries and funeral homes, rather than by the funeral homes. In the UK, these are known as private ambulances.

===2001–2002: &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;===
The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, was released independently in 2001 on EvilEvil. It was after this first release that Gibb assembled a band and they began to perform in venues varying from art galleries to churches to porn theatres to parks. Since these early days the Hidden Cameras have played host to a number of notable musicians, including Reg Vermue, Owen Pallett, Laura Barrett, Don Kerr, Magali Meagher (of the Phonemes), Mike Olsen (of the Arcade Fire) and Maggie MacDonald.

===2003: &quot;The Smell of Our Own&quot;===
Their 2003 album &quot;The Smell of Our Own&quot; was released through Rough Trade in the UK and on the independent label EvilEvil in Canada.

===2004–2005: &quot;Mississauga Goddam&quot; and &quot;The Arms of His &#x27;Ill″&quot;===
In 2004, they released &quot;Mississauga Goddam&quot; on Rough Trade and on EvilEvil in Canada. Their EP &quot;The Arms of His &#x27;Ill″&quot; was released by Absolutely Kosher Records in the same year, and it features jacket art created by Paul P. and G.B. Jones. In November 2005, the band collaborated with Toronto Dance Theatre on the show &quot;In the Boneyard&quot; at the Harbourfront Centre in Toronto. Dancers joined the band throughout the show and played instruments, and the band performed on-stage in costume.

Three of the songs from &quot;Mississauga Goddam&quot; (&quot;We Oh We&quot;, &quot;I Believe in the Good of Life&quot; (a rerecorded version of the same song from the first album), and &quot;Builds the Bone&quot;) are featured in the Canadian movie &quot;Whole New Thing&quot;. &quot;We Oh We&quot; is featured on the soundtrack of the German film &quot;Sommersturm (Summer Storm)&quot;.

===2006: &quot;Awoo&quot;===
&quot;Awoo&quot;, their 2006 recording, was released on Rough Trade in Europe, EvilEvil in Canada, and in the U.S. on Arts &amp; Crafts. The Hidden Cameras&#x27; song &quot;Boys of Melody&quot; is featured on the soundtrack of the John Cameron Mitchell film &quot;Shortbus&quot;. The Hidden Cameras song &quot;Lollipop&quot; is the theme song for the G.B. Jones film &quot;The Lollipop Generation&quot; from 2008, on which Joel Gibb also appears.

===2009: &quot;Origin:Orphan&quot;===
&quot;&quot;, their fifth album, was mastered in May 2009. The music video for &quot;In the NA&quot;, a song from this album, was screened at the 19th Annual Inside Out Film and Video Festival. The album was released on 22 September 2009.

Five songs from &quot;&quot; were redone by electronic pop band from Barcelona Hidrogenesse and released under the name of Hidrogenesse versus the Hidden Cameras in May 2010. Also a video for &quot;He Falls to Me&quot; was done by Darío Peña.

In 2011, they recorded a cover of Mecca Normal&#x27;s &quot;Throw Silver&quot; for the compilation album &quot;Have Not Been the Same - Vol. 1: Too Cool to Live, Too Smart to Die&quot;.

===2013: Arts &amp; Crafts compilations and &quot;Age&quot;===
In 2013, the band appeared on two compilation albums from the label Arts &amp; Crafts. The song &quot;Mind, Matter and Waste&quot;, originally a B-side from their 2009 &quot;In the NA&quot; single, appeared on &quot;Arts &amp; Crafts: 2003-2013&quot; and garnered airplay on CBC Radio 3, and the band collaborated with Snowblink on a cover of Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;The Chauffeur&quot; for &quot;Arts &amp; Crafts: X&quot;.

The album &quot;Age&quot; was released in January 2014. The lead single &quot;Gay Goth Scene&quot; was released in July 2013. The video for the single was directed by Kai Stänicke, who received the Short Film Award for Human Rights at San Marino International Film Festival awards, Tadgell’s Bluebell Honor Award, Best Short Film About/For Youth at the 16th Auburn International Film Festival for Children and Young Adults in Sydney, Australia, and best German short at the International Queer Film Festival Hamburg, Germany.

===2016: &quot;Home on Native Land&quot;===

&quot;Home on Native Land&quot; released on Outside Music was written and recorded over 10 years by Gibb with friends and bandmates, including Rufus Wainwright, Feist, Neil Tennant, Bahamas, Ron Sexsmith and Mary Margaret O’Hara.

<text>A body farm is a research facility where decomposition of humans and animals can be studied in a variety of settings. The initial facility was conceived by anthropologist William M. Bass in 1981 at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Bass was interested in studying the decomposition of a human corpse from the time of death to the time of decay. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the decomposition process, permitting the development of techniques for extracting information such as the timing and circumstances of death from human remains. Body farm research is of particular interest in forensic anthropology and related disciplines, and has applications in the fields of law enforcement and forensic science. Numerous purposes exist for these research facilities, yet their main purpose is to study and form an understanding of the decompositional changes that occur with the human body. By placing the bodies outside to face the elements, researchers are able to get a better understanding of the decomposition process. This research is then used for medical, legal and educational purposes. Following the outdoor research, skeletal remains are cleaned and curated in permanent known skeletal collections open for research. Such collections are critical for testing and developing new identification methods.

Eight such facilities exist across the United States, as far south as sub-tropical Florida (USF-FORT) and as far north as Marquette, Michigan, at Northern Michigan University. The research facility operated by Texas State University at Freeman Ranch is the largest at 26 acres (10.52 hectares). Similar facilities are also operational in Australia and Canada. In the United Kingdom, research has focused on non-human remains, mainly pigs due to their similarity to humans.

==United States==

There are eight decomposition research facilities in the United States, all located at universities (see below). These research facilities have been deemed &quot;body farms&quot; due to the nature of the decomposition research they perform. Rick Schwein, head of the FBI office in Asheville, North Carolina, finds use in the body farms, saying the information from them can be used at many different levels and thus is valuable from a scientific perspective. There have been proposals to open body farms in other locations in the United States. Few of these have been successful as yet; for example, a facility in Las Vegas was proposed in 2003 but was unable to secure funding.

===University of Tennessee===

The original body farm is the University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility located a few miles from downtown on Alcoa Highway in Knoxville, Tennessee, behind the University of Tennessee Medical Center. It was first started in late 1980 by forensic anthropologist William M. Bass as a facility for the study of the decomposition of human remains. Bass became head of the university&#x27;s anthropology department in 1971, and as official state forensic anthropologist for Tennessee he was frequently consulted in police cases involving decomposed human remains. Since no facilities existed that specifically studied decomposition, in 1981 he opened the department&#x27;s first body farm.

It consists of a wooded plot, surrounded by a razor wire fence. At any one time there will be a number of bodies placed in different settings throughout the facility and left to decompose. The bodies are exposed in a number of ways in order to provide insights into decomposition under varying conditions. Some of the conditions students studied were situations such as a body being locked in the trunk of a car, or being submerged under water, which provided some factual and data driven knowledge to help in many forensic cases. Observations and records of the decomposition process are kept, including the sequence and speed of decomposition and the effects of insect activity. The human decomposition stages that are studied begin with the fresh stage, then the bloat stage, then decay, and finally the dry stage.

Over 100 bodies are donated to the facility every year. Some individuals pre-register before their death, and others are donated by their families or by a medical examiner. 60% of donations are made by family members of individuals who were not pre-registered with the facility. Over 1300 people have chosen to pre-register themselves. Perhaps the most famous person to donate his body for study was the anthropologist Grover Krantz, as described by his colleague David Hunt at the Smithsonian.

The University of Tennessee Body Farm is also used in the training of law enforcement officers in scene-of-crime skills and techniques.

===Western Carolina University===
The Forensic Osteology Research Station (FOREST) is located at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, and is the second human decomposition research facility to open in the United States. It was opened in 2007, and is run by WCU&#x27;s Forensic Anthropology program on a small plot on the rural mountain campus. It consists of a plot of land in the Blue Ridge Physiographic Province. The facility has also been used for cadaver dog training.

===Texas State University===

A Forensic Anthropology Research Facility was commissioned by the Texas State University-San Marcos Department of Anthropology and is under the direction of Dr. Michelle Hamilton, a former student of Dr. Bill Bass. The forensic research facility is fully operational and is part of the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State (FACTS). The forensic facility has received a financial donation of over $100,000 from a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Texas State University, and has started construction of an adjoining million dollar lab to augment the facility. The development of this facility has been possible through the efforts of Dr. Jerry Melbye, D-ABFA.

Prior to the selection of the location, objections by local residents and the nearby San Marcos Municipal Airport (owing to concerns about circling vultures) stalled the plan. But on February 12, 2008, Texas State University announced that its Freeman Ranch, off County Road 213 northwest of San Marcos, would be the site of the facility.

The vultures that originally created problems for the location of the research facility have provided a new area of study on the effect of vulture scavenging on human decomposition.

A new body is brought to the facility every five or six months. The bodies typically come from Texas hospitals, funeral homes, or medical examiners&#x27; offices; from there, they are strapped to a gurney, loaded into cargo vans, and brought to the ranch, where researchers and student volunteers begin their research on the corpses.

The Forensic Anthropology Research Facility (FARF) is a human decomposition research laboratory where questions related to outdoor crime scenes and decomposition rates for human remains under various topographical and climate conditions are investigated. The FARF serves as a resource for students of forensic anthropology as well as state and national law enforcement agencies. The work conducted here will have a direct impact on law enforcement and forensic investigations throughout the state of Texas, and beyond.

The Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State accepts body donations for scientific research purposes under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. To date they have received 150 bodies, with up to 200 more donations planned. The areas of research conducted with donated bodies will include reconstructing the postmortem interval to determine time since death and related studies in human decomposition. The overall aim of this type of research is to assist law enforcement agents and the medico-legal community in their investigations.

While practical restraints currently limit the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility to only around seven acres in the Texas Hill Country, Freeman Ranch has about available. Freeman Ranch is a working ranch that also serves as an educational model for ranch management. It is an area of land for educational outreach and research. Researchers and students visit the ranch and participate in educational activities and projects. Researchers and students are allowed to conduct experiments and studies at the ranch, including forensic anthropology.

===Sam Houston State University===
The Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility (STAFS) is a state-of-the-art research and training facility designed to advance academic and technical knowledge in the application of forensic science disciplines to crime scenes and criminal activities. The facility&#x27;s predominant focus of study is the application of forensic sciences to the human body and the vast amount of evidence that can be gleaned from the careful recognition, collection, and preservation of that evidence. The facility is recognized by the Anatomical Board of Texas as a willed-body donor facility, and accepts human body donations for the purposes of scientific research.

The facility trains students, law enforcement officials, academicians and forensic specialists.

The facility is located within the Center for Biological Field Studies at Sam Houston State University, a parcel of land adjacent to the Sam Houston National Forest. One acre of maximum security fencing surrounds the outdoor research facility with an additional of minimum security reserved for other types of forensic training such as search and recovery maneuvers. Contained within the outdoor facility are a variety of various environmental conditions, including a fluvial environment. Web cams are located within the outdoor facility to monitor timing of various post-mortem activities from on and off-campus computers.

The building is designed as a morgue with cooler and freezer units, modern morgue equipment and tools and digital radiograph and microscope capabilities.

The environment in southeast Texas is quite different from the environment of East Tennessee. East Tennessee&#x27;s mean annual temperature is 67 °F (19 °C). The Huntsville, TX area&#x27;s mean annual temperature is 75 °F (23 °C). This difference in temperature from other facilities produces different decomposition results.

===Southern Illinois University===
The Complex for Forensic Anthropology Research (CFAR) was opened at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale in October 2010 by Gretchen R. Dabbs and D. C. Martin to examine the rate and pattern of decomposition in the unique environment of Southern Illinois by working with pigs as human proxies. CFAR is an approximately facility with the lowest average temperature, highest average wind speed, second lowest elevation, most acidic soil, and worst soil drainage compared to other facilities at the time of its founding. The geographic differences between CFAR and other established facilities have been proven to heavily influence the rate and pattern of decomposition due to vulture scavenging. The first human donation was accepted at CFAR in January 2012.

Researchers at CFAR attempt to mimic clandestine body disposal situations and understand how the process of decomposition is altered by those postmortem treatments and how the postmortem treatment can be identified after skeletonization. 

The faculty and staff of CFAR also participate in forensic anthropology consultations and provide training seminars for local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.

===Colorado Mesa University===
The Forensic Investigation Research Station (FIRS) is part of Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, under the direction of Dr. Melissa Connor. Its location is at a high altitude ( AMSL) and receives an average of of rain a year, allowing for the study of decomposition in an arid environment. FIRS has both an indoor research facility, which contains a classroom, wet lab/morgue, walk-in cooler, intake area, office, and secure storage areas, and an outdoor research facility, which consists of approximately two acres of fenced area with outdoor cameras used both for security and research.

The first pig was placed in the outdoor facility in September 2012, the indoor facility opened for classes in January 2013, and the first human donation was placed in November 2013. , the facility had eleven human cadavers on site. Most remains desiccate quickly and current research focuses on the variation in the desiccation process and determining the post-mortem interval on mummified or desiccated remains.

===University of South Florida===
The USF Facility for Outdoor Research and Training (FORT) is part of the Florida Institute for Forensic Anthropology and Applied Science (IFAAS) at the University of South Florida in Tampa. The FORT was created by Erin H. Kimmerle, Executive Director of the Institute of Forensic Anthropology &amp; Applied Science (IFAAS) in 2016. This facility began as a outdoor research laboratory in Pasco County, Florida and has since moved to a larger and more ecologically diverse location outside of Gainesville in Alachua County. It accepts human bodies through the USF Human Donation Program for use in training students and law enforcement on finding clandestine burials, grave excavation, and outdoor crime scene processing, as well as advanced training for mass grave excavation in human rights investigations. The outdoor facility and the ethically sourced, curated skeletal collection is open to visiting scholars and researchers. The program began in 2016 and it is the first and only facility of its type in Florida, as well as in a subtropical environment. 

===George Mason University===
The Forensic Science Research and Training Lab is located at the campus in Prince William County. The five
acre site interred the first body in a clandestine grave to assist in detecting unknown burials.

==Australia==
The Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research (AFTER) was opened in 2016 by Shari Forbes. It is located near Yarramundi in the outskirts of Sydney, Australia, on a patch of land owned by the University of Technology, Sydney, and it is the first body farm outside the United States. It was established as research has demonstrated that differing environmental conditions mean that the findings of body farm analysis in the United States are frequently not relevant to Australia. Research published from AFTER showed using time-lapse imagery that post-mortem movement of arms is greatest during early stages of decomposition, whereas post-mortem movement of legs occurs more during advanced decomposition.

==Canada==
In 2018 the &quot;Secure Site for Research in Thanatology&quot; was established by Shari Forbes at Bécancour, Quebec as part of the University of Quebec in Trois-Rivières. It has since been renamed &quot;Site de Recherche en Sciences Thanatologiques [Expérimentales et Sociales]&quot; (REST[ES]), or Site for Research on Experimental and Social Thanatology. The facility is the first of its kind to study the rate of natural human decomposition in the context of the colder, humid continental northern climate of Canada.

==United Kingdom==
Several universities in Britain have used animal remains to understand human taphonomy but there are currently no facilities that use human remains. Pigs are commonly studied but they are only useful in this field to a certain extent since they don&#x27;t carry the same illnesses or obtain the same injuries as humans that affect cause of death or how the body decomposes. Professor Sue Black has argued that human body farms are unnecessary as they frequently use old people&#x27;s bodies which are not as representative of the average murder victim and animal bodies are just as good. The UK can use the research provided by the facilities in other parts of the world, their climate is different from that in the US and bodies decay differently in differing environments and weather and with different flora and fauna that contribute to decomposition.

==Body donations==
Procedures vary from country to country. Canadian forensic anthropology facilities can access a body when a person has decided to donate their own body and signed a form to ensure their wishes are carried out after the death. Others may allow a family member, the legal next-of-kin, to donate human remains. Unknown/unclaimed bodies have been accepted for donation in the USA although some consider this as unethical.

The body farms will reject a donation if the person had been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, or antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

==Opposition==
The body farms have contributed a great deal to the field of forensic anthropology. However, when such facilities first opened, local communities sometimes resisted, arguing these facilities are disturbing. Many have made the argument that the decomposing corpses will attract insects and scavenging animals. After the opening of the University of Tennessee&#x27;s Body Farm, there were a number of complaints about the odor that was coming from the farm. Also, many people even claimed that they could see the decomposing bodies from their homes. The university fixed this problem by installing a privacy fence. In Tennessee, after the opening of the first body farm, an organization called Solutions to Issues of Concern to Knoxvillians (SICK) protested the facility by holding up signs that read, &quot;This makes us SICK.&quot; However, all of the facilities were able to open and quickly overcame concerns. Some citizens continue to oppose such facilities in their communities. Original plans to build the USF facility on Hillsborough County Sheriff&#x27;s Office property in Lithia were cancelled in April 2015 over concerns from nearby residents about possible smells and groundwater contamination. The facility was ultimately opened in Pasco county.

==Forensic advancement==
Since the start of the initial Body Farm in Tennessee, William Bass, a forensic anthropologist, has worked to help fill in various law enforcement officials on questions involving decomposition rates that help pin-point the time of death of victims during trials. Furthering this research at the Tennessee Body Farm, Bass and his team began to expand into other forensic investigative questions such as what was the climate during death, if water was involved during the decomposition process, and if clothing was on the body or not during decomposition. All questions and areas of focus which help narrow the window of possible death during investigative research on dead and decomposing bodies in trials.

Jennifer DeBruyn, a microbial ecologist, has begun studying both the impact of the environment on the body, and the body&#x27;s impact on the environment at the Tennessee Body Farm as recently as 2015. Focusing on the impact and importance of the microbe environments inside the human body and in the soil as different enzymes leach out during decomposition, DeBruyn and her team have helped narrow down two potential bacterial organisms Bacteroides and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; which offer the potential for consistent cycles and rates during decomposition. DeBruyn hopes this area of research has the potential to narrow down the possible window of death even more so in the face of variations from climate, water, variance in individual metabolic decomposition rates and potential scavengers.

==Medical practice==
Medical practitioners ask a number of questions when observing decomposed or dead bodies. According to Bass, there are seven questions that are required to complete forensic investigations. &quot;Bass lays out these questions as a guideline to help pinpoint potential time of death and cause of death. The questions Bass asks pertain to such decomposition traits as was the body in the shade or sunlight; was there water involved; or even the different stages associated with death and dying which can help paint part of the forensic picture.&quot;

Each stage of death is analyzed independently at the Body Farms to get a better understanding of the decomposition process on the body. Medical practitioners determine which insects or what climate cause human bodies to decompose the quickest, or in which manner they decompose according to differences in temperature or type of insect. The information regarding decomposed bodies is found to be important to the scientific community even if that information is found not necessarily in the bodies themselves, but the soil and plant life surrounding the bodies. Bryant &quot;has found grave importance in the soil surrounding the decomposing bodies at the Body Farms. Pointing out that how the breakdown and leaching of human proteins and bacteria out into the soil can help pinpoint time of death and questions regarding the climate at the scene of death.&quot; Products of the decomposed body eventually seep into the soil leaving behind traces of the body which helps researchers determine the length in time that a body has been in that particular area.

==In popular culture==
The concept of a body farm in general, as well as the existing institutions in particular, have been used in several crime-related works of popular culture. Notable examples include:
* Patricia Cornwell&#x27;s novel &quot;The Body Farm&quot; is based on the University of Tennessee facility, but not on actual events surrounding it. The character of Dr. Thomas Katz was based upon Dr. Bill Bass. In his book, Death&#x27;s Acre, which has a foreword by Cornwell, Bass and co-author Jon Jefferson describe the experiment he undertook on her behalf. A similar experiment conducted by the fictional Dr. Katz solves the book&#x27;s mystery.
* Authors Jon Jefferson and Bill Bass have published a number of fictional murder mystery novels based on the body farm at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville under the pseudonym Jefferson Bass. The lead character is based on Bill Bass.
* In the British television series &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;, forensic pathologist Dr. Eve Lockhart has her own body farm. She reappears in a spin-off series &quot;The Body Farm&quot;.
* In the US show &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot;, the chief medical examiner of Massachusetts, Dr. Maura Isles, has a giant African spur tortoise called &#x27;Bass&#x27; after William M. (Bill) Bass. Also, during the episode 6.04 they visit a body farm at the BCU Boston Cambridge University.
* During episode 6.17 of Fox&#x27;s television series &quot;Bones&quot; entitled &quot;The Feet on the Beach&quot;, medical anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan and her partner FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth visit a body farm at the fictional University of Hogansburg, New York.
* In episode of &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;Burden of Proof&quot; a murder victim&#x27;s body is dumped at the body farm among other bodies.
* In episode of &quot;&quot; entitled &quot;Let the Chips Fall&quot; the CSIs visit a body farm to examine the remains of a woman who had been previously murdered and her body donated to the facility following the investigation into her death.
* A body farm within a forensic training facility is featured in the beginning of episode 9.17 of Fox&#x27;s television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The episode, titled &quot;Release&quot;, mentions that the facility is located in Joplin, Virginia.
* Simon Beckett&#x27;s novel &quot;Whispers of the Dead&quot; is set in and around the body farm in Knoxville, Tennessee. It is the third book in a series centered on protagonist Dr. David Hunter, a forensic anthropologist. The series itself was inspired by Beckett&#x27;s visit to the body farm in Tennessee.
* During episode 2 of the documentary series &quot;Stephen Fry in America&quot;, host Stephen Fry visits the University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility.
* In episode 3.2 of &quot;Law and Order: SVU&quot; entitled &quot;Wrath&quot; several murder victims&#x27; bodies are dumped at the body farm among other bodies.
* In Tim Dorsey&#x27;s book &quot;Torpedo Juice&quot;, Serge and Coleman dump a body in a body farm in the Florida Everglades, located off the Tamiami Trail.
* In episode 9 of &quot;Durarara!! x2 Ten&quot; Shinra mentions that his father researches the body farm for a local drugstore.
* Photographer Sally Mann&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;What Remains&quot; (2003), includes a series of photographs of dead and decomposing bodies taken at the Tennessee Forensic Anthropology Center.
* Filmmakers Brandon Keenan and Nick LaMantia released a film with the working &quot;Body Farm&quot; on March 1, 2020, on DirecTV, Google Play, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple TV.
* San Diego death grind band Cattle Decapitation has a song called &quot;A Body Farm&quot; on their 2009 album &quot;The Harvest Floor&quot; about a serial killer who leaves the bodies of his victims to decompose around his home.
*In 2019, HBO VICE did a 20-minute documentary on the USF-FORT program showing the impact it has on cold case investigations.

<doc id="740086" wikidata="Q5385952" url="?curid=740086" title="Eric's Trip">
<text>Eric&#x27;s Trip is a Canadian indie rock band from Moncton, New Brunswick. Eric&#x27;s Trip achieved prominence as the first Canadian band to be signed to Seattle&#x27;s flagship grunge label Sub Pop in the early 1990s. 

The band had a minor hit in alternative circles with the single &quot;View Master&quot;, from the 1994 album &quot;Forever Again.&quot;

==History==
Eric&#x27;s Trip formed in 1990 when musicians Rick White and Chris Thompson joined Julie Doiron and Ed Vaughan (who was later replaced by Mark Gaudet). They took their name from a Sonic Youth song and developed a unique sound which fused elements of the distorted guitar of Dinosaur Jr., vocal elements of My Bloody Valentine, the folk leanings of Neil Young, and the lo-fi aesthetic of Sebadoh. White described their sound as &quot;sappy melodic pop music on top of thick distortion.&quot; Gaudet&#x27;s description was more succinct: &quot;dreamy punk&quot;.

The band released their first full-length album, &quot;Love Tara&quot;, in 1993. and its follow-up &quot;Purple Blue&quot; in 1996. In between, Eric&#x27;s Trip played the 1995 edition of the Tragically Hip&#x27;s &quot;Another Roadside Attraction (festival)&quot; tour. 
Eric&#x27;s Trip went on indefinite hiatus in 1996 and reunited in 2001. They also played a series of shows between 2007 and 2009. These included a show at the 2007 Halifax Pop Explosion and the 2008 edition of Primavera Sound in Barcelona, Spain and the SP20, a 20th anniversary concert for Sub Pop Records that took place in Redmond, Washington. 

They played at the Sappy Records Festival in Sackville, New Brunswick from 2006 to 2009, with their final performance as a band occurring at the 2009 edition of the festival. In 2010 both White and Doiron played separate sets at SappyFest.

==Post Eric&#x27;s Trip projects &amp; legacy==
Doiron currently has a successful solo career; in 1999, she recorded the album &quot;Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars&quot; with the Ottawa band Wooden Stars, which won a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album of the Year, and from 2003 to 2007 she performed with Shotgun &amp; Jaybird. 

White and Gaudet played in Elevator until 2009, when White announces the bands dissolution at that years SappyFest. Since then, White has also released three solo albums under the name Rick White Album, &quot;The Rick White Album&quot;, &quot;Memoreaper&quot; and &quot;137&quot; during, and after Elevator. Gaudet currently plays in the heavy metal band Funeral Fog. Thompson enjoyed some fame as Moon Socket, and currently plays in The Memories Attack with Ron Bates of Moncton band Orange Glass, as well as the band Diamondtown.

White produced Doiron&#x27;s solo albums &quot;Woke Myself Up&quot; (2007) and &quot;I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day&quot; (2009). &quot;Woke Myself Up&quot; features three tracks on which the entire Eric&#x27;s Trip lineup contributed to the recording, their first studio collaboration since the band&#x27;s 1996 breakup, while &quot;I Can Wonder&quot; has been described by critics as directly revisiting the sound and style of Eric&#x27;s Trip for the first time in Doiron&#x27;s solo career.

A two-disc CD tribute album, titled &quot;Songs For Eric: A Tribute to Eric&#x27;s Trip&quot; featuring Eric&#x27;s Trip songs covered by artists influenced by the band, released by Gooseberry Rcords, in April 2009.

<doc id="740088" wikidata="Q3051029" url="?curid=740088" title="Hurricane Michelle">
<text>Hurricane Michelle was the fifth costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history and the strongest hurricane of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. The thirteenth named storm and seventh hurricane that year, Michelle developed from a tropical wave that had traversed into the western Caribbean Sea on October 29; the wave had initially moved off the coast of Africa 13 days prior. In its early developmental stages, the depression meandered over Nicaragua, later paralleling the Mosquito Coast before intensifying into tropical storm intensity on November 1; Michelle was upgraded to hurricane strength the following day. Shortly after, rapid intensification ensued within favorable conditions, with the storm&#x27;s central barometric pressure dropping in 29 hours. After a slight fluctuation in strength, Michelle reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of and a minimum pressure of . This tied Michelle with 1999&#x27;s Lenny as the fourth most powerful November hurricane on record in the Atlantic Basin, behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane and 2020 Hurricanes Iota and Eta. At roughly the same time, the hurricane began to accelerate northeastward; this brought the intense hurricane to a Cuban landfall within the Bay of Pigs later that day. Crossing over the island, Michelle was weakened significantly, and was only a Category 1 hurricane upon reentry into the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over The Bahamas on November 5, before being absorbed by a cold front the following day.

Hurricane Michelle caused widespread devastation across the western Caribbean during its eight-day trek. As a tropical wave, torrential rainfall occurred across Jamaica, causing mudslides and killing two people. Damage in the island country was estimated at $18 million. When the storm drifted over areas of Central America early in its existence, heavy rains isolated numerous villages and damaged infrastructure, affecting areas affected by Hurricane Mitch roughly three years prior. In Honduras and Nicaragua, 14 people were killed, with an additional 62 people unaccounted for. In the Cayman Islands, areas were affected by strong storm surge and flooding, particularly in Grand Cayman, where damage was totaled $28 million.

The majority of damage caused by Michelle occurred in Cuba, where the storm was the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the island in over 49 years. Strong storm surge and heavy rainfall disrupted communication networks across the country. High winds and rain also destroyed buildings and damaged the sugar cane crop. At the time, Michelle was the costliest hurricane in Cuban history with an estimated $2 billion in damage; this figure was greatly surpassed by Hurricane Ike nearly seven years later. As a weakening system, Michelle moved past Florida and the Bahamas. Strong waves caused severe beach erosion and winds damaged property. Throughout the entirety of Michelle&#x27;s track, 22 people were killed, and damage was estimated at $2.43 billion (2001 USD; $  USD). After the season, the name Michelle was retired and was replaced with Melissa for the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.

==Meteorological history==

On October 16, 2001, a tropical wave moved westward off the coast of Africa and moved into the Atlantic Ocean. At the time, the wave produced minimal convective and thunderstorm activity. On October 23, the disturbance crossed the Lesser Antilles before moving into the Caribbean Sea while showing minimal signs of tropical development. Three days later, the wave moved into the western Caribbean, spawning a broad low-pressure area off the coast of Nicaragua. At 1800 UTC on October 29, a reconnaissance flight confirmed the development of a tropical depression south-southwest of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. At the time, convection was displaced primarily to the north of the center of circulation, and the storm was situated in a weak steering pattern; as such, initial forecasts predicted for the depression, designated as &quot;Tropical Depression Fifteen&quot;, to slowly move generally northward. Later that day, a burst of convection occurred over the circulation center of the depression, indicating an increase in organization. The disturbance meandered over eastern Nicaragua for 36 hours before emerging into the Caribbean Sea near Cabo Gracias a Dios by 2100 UTC on October 31. Upon emerging into the Caribbean Sea, the depression quickly organized, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to tropical storm strength at 0000 UTC the following day, based on information from a reconnaissance flight prior. As such, the tropical storm was designated with the name &quot;Michelle&quot;.

Gradual strengthening occurred throughout November 1, as Michelle&#x27;s cloud tops began to cool as it drifted northward, signifying strengthening. At the time, the NHC predicted that there was a roughly 12 percent chance for the tropical storm to rapidly intensify; by that time the storm had met three of the organization&#x27;s five criterion for rapid intensification. During the day, fluctuations in convective activity occurred and there were some signs of wind shear affecting the cyclone, but there was a general strengthening trend. Two dropsondes deployed within the system early on November 2 observed hurricane-force winds within Michelle; based on this data the NHC upgraded Michelle to hurricane intensity at 1200 UTC that day, while the storm was situated south-southeast of the Guanahacabibes Peninsula.

A period of rapid intensification began shortly after as Michelle&#x27;s satellite presentation improved, with the cyclone&#x27;s minimum barometric pressure falling in 29 hours. At 0000 UTC on November 3, the hurricane attained Category 2 hurricane intensity. At roughly the same time, the hurricane&#x27;s eye became more apparent on satellite imagery. By 1200 UTC later that day, Michelle had intensified to a Category 4 hurricane. Six hours later, the hurricane weakened to Category 3 intensity, but reached its minimum barometric pressure of . Afterwards, Michelle&#x27;s central pressure began to rise; despite the trend, its maximum sustained winds also strengthened as it curved northeastward. Despite having its convective organization disrupted and its eye no longer as apparent on November 4, Michelle attained winds of by 0600 UTC that day; these would be the highest sustained winds estimated for the system throughout its existence.

At 1800 UTC on November 4, Michelle made landfall on Cayo Largo del Sur as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of ; this was followed shortly after with a landfall on the Bay of Pigs five hours later as a slightly weaker storm. When Michelle made landfall on the Cuban mainland, it was the strongest landfalling hurricane in Cuban history since the landfall of Hurricane Fox in 1952. At the time, the hurricane&#x27;s minimum barometric pressure was . Over Cuba, Michelle&#x27;s center of circulation was significantly disrupted, and as a result the hurricane decreased in intensity; by the time it had emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on November 5, winds were only estimated at . Southwesterly wind shear further inhibited any additional tropical development, and as such Michelle began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. That day, the weakening hurricane made landfalls over Andros Island and Eleuthera Island before becoming fully extratropical by 0000 UTC on November 6, while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. The extratropical system persisted for roughly 18 more hours before it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.

==Preparations==

===Cuba===

As Hurricane Michelle approached the Cuban coast, the government of Cuba issued a hurricane watch for the western Cuban provinces of Pinar del Río, La Habana, Matanzas, and Isla de la Juventud at 2100 UTC on November 1. The following day, the same hurricane watch was extended eastward to include all provinces from Pinar del Río to Ciego de Ávila; all hurricane watches in Cuba were upgraded to hurricane warnings at 1100 UTC on November 3. All warnings in Cuba were discontinued once Michelle began to accelerate out to sea at 1200 UTC on November 5.

Prior to reaching the coast, Michelle was expected to be the strongest Cuban tropical cyclone in at least 75 years. The Cuban Red Cross deployed 24,500 volunteers across Cuba to assist civil defense teams in evacuation procedures for potentially affected populations. By November 4, an estimated 590,000 people were evacuated across the country, including 80 percent of the population of the province of Pinar del Río. In Havana, authorities evacuated 150,000 people. Coastal tourist resorts were cleared, and 35,500 students were evacuated out of camps hosted on the Zapata Peninsula. On Cuba&#x27;s southwestern islands including Cayo Largo and Isla de la Juventud, 500 tourists were evacuated. The entire population of Surgidero de Batabanó was evacuated. In addition to the evacuations, the government sent food, water, and medicine supplies to areas south of the capital. All domestic and international flights to and from the country were cancelled.

===Elsewhere===
At 17:00 UTC on November 1, a tropical storm watch was issued for Grand Cayman Island. Three hours prior, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning in conjunction with a hurricane watch for areas of the Florida Keys from Ocean Reef, Florida to the Dry Tortugas. At 03:00 UTC on November 4, a hurricane watch was issued for areas of the northwestern and central Bahamas. At the same time, a new tropical storm warning was issued for the east coast of Florida between Jupiter Inlet and Ocean Reef, and for the state&#x27;s western coast south of Bonita Beach. At 06:00 UTC, the tropical storm watch for Grand Cayman was upgraded and extended to include the entirety of the Cayman Islands. Six hours later, the hurricane watch for the Florida Keys was upgraded to warning status. Early the next day, a hurricane watch was issued for Bermuda after Michelle made its final Cuban landfall. Meanwhile, the tropical storm warning issued for the Cayman Islands was discontinued. As Michelle accelerated away from landmasses, warnings and watches were discontinued. All tropical cyclone warnings in the United States were discontinued by 21:00 UTC that day. At the same time, however, the hurricane watch for Bermuda was changed to a tropical storm warning; this warning was sustained for a day before being discontinued, shortly after all warnings in the Bahamas were also discontinued.

==Impact==
Hurricane Michelle brought torrential rains along its path through the western Caribbean Sea, killing 22 people and causing extensive damage in Central America and Cuba.

===Jamaica===
As the precursor tropical wave to Michelle drifted through the western Caribbean Sea, it produced torrential rainfall on the island of Jamaica, causing widespread flooding. Several residences on Annotto Bay and Port Maria were flooded. As a result, 163 evacuees sought shelter in locations in Annotto Bay. In Portland, a shelter was opened for effected populations; in the same parish, six homes were swept away from their foundations. In the parishes of Saint Catherine, Saint Andrew, and Saint Ann, several roads were blocked by debris. The Jamaican National Works Agency (NWA) worked to clear the road debris. The blocked roads isolated seven Jamaican villages for an extended period of time.

After tropical cyclogenesis, Michelle passed to the northwest of Jamaica, producing additional rainfall. In a 48-hour period beginning on October 29, a location measured , denoting an average rainfall rate of per hour. Many other locations reported high rainfall totals over a ten-day period throughout Michelle&#x27;s passage near Jamaica. Near Spur Tree Hill, an oil spill resulted from the flooding. Roads that were previously cleaned of debris a few days prior were covered again by the additional rainfall. The rains also disrupted the country&#x27;s communication and electrical grid, leaving 6,000 homes without power in affected regions. The widespread power outages in conjunction with invasive floodwaters also caused the cessation of 31 water plants run by the National Water Commission. Overall, 30 homes were destroyed by flooding caused by Michelle as it passed to the northwest. Extensive damage was reported to small livestock, bananas, plantains, vegetables, and coffee. Coffee crops were severely affected in Portland and Saint Andrew Parishes, with losses calculated at J$102.6 million (US$2.2 million). Roughly of banana plantations were damaged over four parishes, amounting to J$18.2 million (US$400,000) in damage. The plantain crop, mostly grown for domestic usage, suffered extensive damage valued at J$22 million (US$480,000). Losses sustained to livestock were estimated at J$30.8 million (US$670,000).

Overall, floods caused widespread damage throughout Jamaica. The watersheds of the Spanish and Swift Rivers were the worst affected areas. Near the coast, the rivers began to overflow due to excess floodwater, eroding beach roads and three major highways. In Portland Parish, the rains caused numerous landslides. In the community of Bybrook alone, it was estimated that roughly of material was deposited in the village. An assessment of the damage concluded that 500 homes were destroyed beyond repair, while an additional 561 homes were at least damaged by the floods and heavy rain. While one school was damaged solely by the floods, six other schools were damaged due to their use as shelters. Damage on Jamaica due to Michelle totaled $18 million, of which $11.8 million was due to crop and livestock losses. Damage to bridges alone totaled J$143.7 million (US$3.1 million). Five fatalities were also confirmed, and 340 people were displaced from their homes.

===Central America===

In its early developmental stages as a tropical depression, Michelle drifted over areas of Central America for roughly 36 hours, dropping torrential rainfall and causing widespread flooding in areas affected by Hurricane Mitch almost exactly three years prior. The hardest hit region was Gracias a Dios Department in northeastern Honduras, where at one point 100 villages were isolated by the floods. The torrential rainfall caused the displacement of at least 100,000 people from their residences. Across Central America, over 27,300 people were evacuated from flooded areas.

In Honduras, the floods damaged 245 homes, resulting in the displacement of 4,393 people across the country. Six bridges sustained at least partial damage, of which three were destroyed. As a result of the damage, the government of Honduras declared a state of emergency for five departments – Colón, Atlántida, Yoro, Cortés, and Santa Bárbara. The floods caused by Michelle were further exacerbated by a cold front which lingered over the region, dropping additional rainfall. Of the affected departments, Yoro was the most affected, with no supply of drinkable water and electricity following the flooding. Near Yoro, a bridge crossing the Cuyamapa River collapsed due to the floodwaters. Despite the heavy rainfall, areas of Honduras suffering from a prolonged drought did not receive beneficial rainfall. Overall, the floods in Honduras killed 21 people and caused $5 million in damage. Thirty-five of the country&#x27;s water systems were destroyed. The rains also caused the loss of 70 percent of bean crops.

Although the precursor to Michelle remained stationary primarily over Nicaragua, damage was not as significant as in Honduras due to the storm&#x27;s displacement of convection to the north. Nonetheless, floods still isolated villages and other communities in the Nicaraguan districts of Bonaza, Rosita, Siuna, Puerto Cabezas, Waspam, and to a lesser extent, Prinzapolka. In those areas, roads and bridges were damaged, and in some cases, destroyed. The heavy rains also damaged crops. Due to the rains, an estimated 6,000 people evacuated from their homes. The port city of Puerto Cabezas was partially flooded. As a result of Michelle, a total of 16 deaths were confirmed, and damage in the country was estimated at $1 million. In Costa Rica, Michelle caused anomalously high rainfall, resulting in flooding. Overall, damage in Costa Rica totaled $1 million, though no deaths were reported.

===Cayman Islands===
In early November, Hurricane Michelle brought heavy surf, storm surge, and flooding to the Cayman Islands. Of the islands in the archipelago, Grand Cayman experienced the worst effects from Michelle, particularly along the island&#x27;s west coast. Rainfall peaked at in Grand Cayman; the same station recorded a peak wind gust of . The rains caused localized flooding in the western and southern portions of the island. Another weather station in Cayman Brac observed a peak wind gust of . Overall, damage from the Cayman Islands totaled $60 million.

===Cuba===
In Cuba, about 750,000 people and 741,000 animals were evacuated prior to the hurricane&#x27;s arrival. Hurricane Michelle quickly crossed the island as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest since 1952&#x27;s Hurricane Fox. To the south of Cuba, Cayo Largo del Sur received a 9–10 foot storm surge, inundating the entire island with water. Closer to Cuba, the Isle of Youth experienced of rain with waves, causing extensive power outages and flooding.

On the coast of western and southern Cuba, Michelle produced 4–5 foot waves, along with a heavy storm surge. Rainfall amounts up to 754 mm/29.69 inches were recorded across the island. In addition, 300 mm/11.83 inches was reported at Punta del Este. The provinces of Matanzas, Villa Clara, and Cienfuegos were hardest hit, where 10,000 homes were destroyed and another 100,000 damaged. Severe damage was also reported to the sugar cane and in the tourist town of Varadero. In Havana, winds and rain destroyed 23 buildings, with many others damaged. Due to well-executed warnings and evacuations, only 5 people were killed in Cuba. The Category 4 hurricane caused US$1.8 billion in damage.
The United States offered aid to the island, an act it had done in the past despite a political embargo. President Fidel Castro refused, believing his country would survive with enough resources for the reconstruction process.

===Florida===
Severe beach erosion due to increased swells over several days took place from Hollywood Beach to Hallandale Beach. At high tide on November 4, water topped the seawall, damaging it and nearby structures leaving $20,000 in damages. The cost to restore the beaches was estimated at $10 million. The highest winds in relation to the storm were recorded in Sombrero Key; sustained winds reached and gusts reached . A storm surge of was recorded along the southeast coastline of Florida. Damages from the hurricane amounted to $50,000.

Two tornadoes touched down in the state within the outer bands of the hurricane. The first formed as a waterspout and moved onshore near Bill Baggs Beach and destroyed two Chikee huts, costing $6,000, warranting F0 intensity, before dissipating. The second and stronger of the two tornadoes, rated F1, tracked for in Palm Beach County. Windows were blown out of vehicles and buildings, trees and signs were downed and a small area of sugar cane was leveled by the tornado. Damages from the tornado amounted to $10,000. A NOAA WP-3D Orion hurricane hunter aircraft was damaged during a mission into the storm.

===Bahamas===
Because Hurricane Michelle was weakened and moving rapidly as it moved through the Bahamas, no deaths or injuries were reported. The hurricane still retained some of its strength, and caused of rain in Nassau, while New Providence received a storm surge of 5–8 feet. Flooding was reported throughout the archipelago and high winds downed numerous trees, resulting in 200,000 power outages. A few homes sustained roof damage and the roof a shopping center in Nassau was blown into a nearby funeral home. The radio tower of the station MORE FM was snapped in half by high winds, resulting in a severe disruption of radio broadcasts.

==Aftermath==
Ships carrying tons of frozen chicken legs and corn arrived in Havana&#x27;s harbor on December 16, to aid in the recovery of Cuba from Hurricane Michelle. The shipments are part of a one-time $30 million purchase of U.S. food by the Cuban government to assist in the country&#x27;s present food shortage.

The Cuban government refused an initial U.S. offer of humanitarian assistance, but accepted a proposal to purchase the goods instead. Although the United States has maintained an economic embargo on Cuba for decades, U.S. law does allow shipments of food and medicine to the communist-controlled island. But until now the Cuban government has refused to buy American food because of the restrictions, including a ban on direct U.S. financing of food sales.

Other aid from the international community is helping Cuba survive Michelle&#x27;s aftermath. Cuba was promised $600,000 in aid from Chinese leader Li Peng, who was visiting when the hurricane struck. Venezuela also sent humanitarian assistance.

===Retirement===

Because of the significant damage and number of deaths in Cuba, the name &quot;Michelle&quot; was retired in the spring of 2002 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. The name was replaced with &quot;Melissa&quot; for the 2007 season.

<doc id="740093" wikidata="Q27792" url="?curid=740093" title="Tlingit language">
<text>The Tlingit language ( ; &quot;&quot; ) is spoken by the Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska and Western Canada and is a branch of the Na-Dene language family. Extensive effort is being put into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and culture.

Missionaries of the Russian Orthodox Church were the first to develop a written version of Tlingit by using the Cyrillic script to record and translate it when the Russian Empire had contact with Alaska and the coast of North America down to Sonoma County, California. After the Alaska Purchase, English-speaking missionaries from the United States developed a written version of the language with the Latin alphabet.

==History==
The history of Tlingit is poorly known, mostly because there is no written record until the first contact with Europeans around the 1790s. Documentation was sparse and irregular until the early 20th century. The language appears to have spread northward from the Ketchikan–Saxman area towards the Chilkat region since certain conservative features are reduced gradually from south to north. The shared features between the Eyak language, found around the Copper River delta, and Tongass Tlingit, near the Portland Canal, are all the more striking for the distances that separate them, both geographic and linguistic.

==Classification==
Tlingit is currently classified as a distinct and separate branch of Na-Dene, an indigenous language family of North America. Edward Sapir (1915) argued for its inclusion in the Na-Dené family, a claim that was subsequently debated by Franz Boas (1917), P.E. Goddard (1920), and many other prominent linguists of the time.

Studies in the late 20th century by (Heinz-)Jürgen Pinnow (1962, 1968, 1970, int. al.) and Michael E. Krauss (1964, 1965, 1969, int. al.) showed a strong connection to Eyak and hence to the Athabaskan languages.

Sapir initially proposed a connection between Tlingit and Haida, but the debate over Na-Dene gradually excluded Haida from the discussion. Haida is now considered an isolate, with some borrowing from its long proximity with Tlingit. In 2004, the Haida linguist John Enrico presented new arguments and reopened the debate. Victor Golla writes in his 2011 &quot;California Native Languages&quot;, &quot;John Enrico, the contemporary linguist with the deepest knowledge of Haida, continues to believe that a real, if distant, genetic relationship connects Haida to Na-Dene[.]&quot;

==Geographic distribution==
The Tlingit language is distributed from near the mouth of the Copper River down the open coast of the Gulf of Alaska and throughout almost all of the islands of the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska. It is characterized by four or five distinct dialects, but they are mostly mutually intelligible. Almost all of the area where the Tlingit language is endemic is contained within the modern borders of Alaska.

The exception is an area known as &quot;Inland Tlingit&quot; that extends up the Taku River and into northern British Columbia and the Yukon around Atlin Lake (&quot;Áa Tleen&quot; &quot;Big Lake&quot;) and Teslin Lake (&quot;Desleen&quot; &lt; &quot;Tas Tleen&quot; &quot;Big Thread&quot;) lake districts, as well as a concentration around Bennett Lake at the end of the Chilkoot Trail (&quot;Jilkhoot&quot;). Otherwise, Tlingit is not found in Canada. Tlingit legend tells that groups of Tlingit once inhabited the Stikine, Nass, and Skeena river valleys during their migrations from the interior. There is a small group of speakers (some 85) in Washington as well.

=== Use and revitalization efforts ===
Golla (2007) reported a decreasing population of 500 speakers in Alaska. The First Peoples&#x27; Cultural Council (2014) reported 2 speakers in Canada out of an ethnic population of 400.

As of 2013, Tlingit courses are available at the University of Alaska Southeast. In April 2014, Alaska HB 216 recognized Tlingit as an official language of Alaska, lending support to language revitalization.

==Dialects==
Tlingit is divided into roughly five major dialects, all of which are essentially mutually intelligible:
* The Northern dialect is also called the Yakutat (&quot;Yakhwdaat&quot;) dialect, after its principal town and is spoken in an area south from Lituya Bay (&quot;Litu.aa&quot;) to Frederick Sound.
* The Transitional dialect, a two-tone dialect like the Northern dialect but has phonological features of the Southern, is historically spoken in the villages of Petersburg (&quot;Gántiyaakw Séedi&quot; &quot;Steamboat Canyon&quot;), Kake (&quot;Khéixh&#x27; &quot; &quot;Daylight&quot;), and Wrangell (&quot;Khaachxhana.áak&#x27;w&quot; &quot;Khaachxhan&#x27;s Little Lake&quot;), and in the surrounding regions although it has almost disappeared.
* The similarly-moribund Southern dialects of &quot;Sanya&quot; and &quot;Heinya&quot; are spoken from Sumner Strait south to the Alaska-Canada border, excepting Annette Island, which is the reservation of the Tsimshian, and the southern end of Prince of Wales Island, which is the land of the Kaigani Haida (&quot;K&#x27;aayk&#x27;aani&quot;).
* The Inland Tlingit dialect is spoken in Canada around Atlin Lake and Teslin Lake.
* The Tongass Tlingit dialect was once spoken in the Cape Fox area south of Ketchikan but recently died with its last speakers in the 1990s.

The various dialects of Tlingit can be classified roughly into two-tone and three-tone systems. Tongass Tlingit, however, has no tone but a four-way register contrast between short, long, glottalized, and &quot;fading&quot; vowels. (In the last type, the onset of the vowel is articulated normally but the release is murmured, essentially a rapid opening of the glottis once articulation is begun.)

The tone values in two-tone dialects can be predicted in some cases from the three-tone values but not the reverse. Earlier, it was hypothesized that the three-tone dialects were older and that the two-tone dialects evolved from them. However, Jeff Leer&#x27;s discovery of the Tongass dialect in the late 1970s has shown that the Tongass vowel system is adequate to predict the tonal features of both the two-tone and three-tone dialects, but none of the tonal dialects could be used to predict vocalic feature distribution in Tongass Tlingit. Thus, Tongass Tlingit is the most conservative of the various dialects of Tlingit, preserving contrasts which have been lost in the other dialects.

The fading and glottalized vowels in Tongass Tlingit have also been compared with similar systems in the Coast Tsimshian dialect. However, Krauss and Leer (1981, p. 165) point out that the fading vowels in Coastal Tsimshian are the surface realization of underlying sequences of vowel and glottalized sonorant, . That is in contradistinction to the glottal modifications in Tongass Tlingit, which Leer argues are symmetric with the modifications of the consonantal system. Thus, a fading vowel is symmetric with an aspirated consonant , and a glottalized vowel is symmetric with an ejective (glottalized) consonant . That implies that the two systems have no familial relationship. Leer (1978) speculated that the maintenance of the pretonal system in Tongass Tlingit was caused by the proximity of its speakers around the Cape Fox area near the mouth of the Portland Canal to speakers of Coastal Tsimshian, just to the south.

==Phonology==

Tlingit has a complex phonological system compared to Indo-European languages such as English or Spanish. It has an almost complete series of ejective consonants accompanying its stop, fricative, and affricate consonants. The only missing consonant in the Tlingit ejective series is . The language is also notable for having several laterals but no voiced and for having no labials in most dialects, except for and in recent English loanwords.

===Consonants===
The consonants in the table are given in the IPA, with the popular orthography equivalents in brackets.


Nasal consonants assimilating with and the velar and uvular plosives is common among Tlingit-speakers of all dialects. For example, the sequence &quot;ng&quot; () is often heard as and &quot;ngh&quot; () as . Native speakers in a teaching position may admonish learners when they produce these assimilated forms, deriding them as &quot;not Tlingit&quot; or &quot;too English&quot;, but it is common to later hear such speakers producing those forms themselves. It is uncertain whether this assimilation is autochthonous or if it arose from contact with English, but the former is more likely from a purely articulatory perspective.

Young speakers and second-language learners are increasingly making a voiced/unvoiced distinction between consonants, rather than the traditional unaspirated/aspirated distinction. That is because of the influence of English, which makes a similar distinction. For speakers who make the voiced/unvoiced distinction, the distribution is symmetrical with the unaspirated/aspirated distinction among other speakers.

Maddieson, Smith, and Bessel (2001) note that all word final non-ejective stops are phonemically unaspirated. That contrasts with the orthography that typically represents them as aspirated stops: &quot;t&quot; for the more accurate &quot;d&quot; . There is a wide variation in ordinary speech, ranging from unreleased to a very delayed aspiration . However, the underlying phoneme is certainly unaspirated since it is consistently produced when the word is suffixed. The orthography usually but not always reflects that: &quot;hít&quot; &quot;house&quot; is written &quot;(du) hídi&quot; &quot;(his) house&quot; when marked with the possessive suffix &quot;-ÿí&quot;. It is possible but has not been verified that aspirated and unaspirated stops are collapsed into a single phoneme word-finally.

Maddieson and colleagues also confirm that the ejective fricatives in Tlingit are in fact true ejectives, despite the widely-held assumption that ejective fricatives are not actually phonetically ejective but are as a sequence of fricative and glottal stop. In Tlingit, at least, the articulation of ejective fricatives includes complete closure of the glottis before frication begins, and the larynx is raised in the same manner as with ejective stops.

Characteristically, the ejective fricatives in Tlingit feature a much smaller aperture for frication than is found in ordinary fricatives. That articulation provides increased resistance to counter the continual loss of dynamic airstream pressure. Also, ejective fricatives appear to include tightening of the pharyngeal muscles, which reduces the diameter of the air column and so further increases pressure. That pharyngeal constriction is not true pharyngealization, however, since the diameter is still greater than what is found in pharyngealized consonants in other languages.

===Vowels===

Tlingit has eight vowels, four vowels further distinguished formally by length. However, the length distinction is often in terms of tenseness rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low tone; in the orthography high tone is indicated by an acute accent (&quot;áa&quot;) and low tone is unmarked (&quot;aa&quot;). The Southern and Transitional dialects have a mid tone which is unmarked and additional low tone which is marked by a grave accent (&quot;àa&quot;).

The Inland Tlingit orthography does not use vowel digraphs. Instead, short high vowels are marked with an acute accent, long high vowels are marked with a circumflex, and long low vowels are marked with a grave accent. Short low vowels are unmarked. Coastal Tlingit &lt;áa&gt; and &lt;aa&gt; are Inland &lt;â&gt; and &lt;à&gt; respectively. Coastal &lt;éi&gt; and &lt;ei&gt; are Inland &lt;ê&gt; and &lt;è&gt;, Coastal &lt;ée&gt; and &lt;ee&gt; are Inland &lt;î&gt; and &lt;ì&gt;, and Coastal &lt;óo&gt; and &lt;oo&gt; are Inland &lt;û&gt; and &lt;ù&gt;.


Word onset is always consonantal in Tlingit and so words never begin with a vowel. Where a vowel would theoretically have occurred, such as by prefixing or compounding, the vowel is always followed by either or . The former is universal in single words, and both are found in word-medial position in compounds. The orthography does not reflect the in word-initial position, but either &quot;.&quot; or &quot;y&quot; may be seen in medial position. For example:

But when the perfective prefix &quot;ÿu-&quot; is word-initial, the glottal stop appears to ensure that the word begins with a consonant.

==Writing system==

Until the late 1960s, Tlingit was written exclusively in phonetic transcription in the works of linguists and anthropologists except for a little-known Cyrillic alphabet used for publications by the Russian Orthodox Church. A number of amateur anthropologists doing extensive work on the Tlingit had no training in linguistics and so left numerous samples in vague and inconsistent transcriptions, the most famous being George T. Emmons. However, such noted anthropologists as Franz Boas, John R. Swanton, and Frederica de Laguna have transcribed Tlingit in various related systems that feature accuracy and consistency but sacrifice readability.

Two problems ensue from the multiplicity of transcription systems used for Tlingit. One is that there are many of them, thus requiring any reader to learn each individual system depending on what sources are used. The other is that most transcriptions made before Boas&#x27;s study of Tlingit have numerous mistakes in them, particularly because of misinterpretations of the short vowels and ejective consonants. Accuracy of transcription can be increased by checking against similar words in other systems, or against a modern work postdating Naish and Story&#x27;s work in the 1960s.

==Grammar==

Tlingit grammar at first glance appears to be highly fusional, but this is an incorrect assumption. There are predictable processes by which the basic phonetic shapes of individual morphemes are modified to fit various phonological requirements. These processes can be described with a regular language, and such descriptions are given here on a per morpheme basis by giving rule schemas for the context sensitive phonological modification of base morphemes. Analyzing all the possible combinations of morphemes and phonological contexts in Tlingit and constructing a regular language to describe them is a daunting but tractable task.

Despite not being a fusional language, Tlingit is still highly synthetic as an agglutinating language, and is even polysynthetic to some extent. The verb, as with all the Na-Dené languages, is characteristically incorporating. Nouns are in comparison relatively simple, with many being derived from verbs.

===Word order===

Tlingit word order is SOV when non-pronominal agent and object phrases both exist in the sentence. However, there is a strong urge to restrict the argument of the verb phrase to a single non-pronominal noun phrase, with any other phrases being extraposed from the verb phrase. If a noun phrase occurs outside of the verb phrase then it is typically represented in the verb phrase by an appropriate pronoun.

===Nouns===
:&quot;See main article: Tlingit noun&quot;

===Pronominals===

Tlingit has a complex system of pronominals, which vary depending on their relationship to the verb. The subject pronominals are incorporated into the verb in its subject slot. The object pronominals are also technically incorporated into the verb (i.e. the verb &quot;complex&quot;), but most are graphically independent. They are divided into three classes, the verbal object, nominal object, and postpositional object. There are also the independent pronominals which are completely separate from the verb and can be used in dependent clauses or in subject or object position.

The pronominals all have related semantic values, and their organization can hence easily be visualized in a table.

The numbers in the first column represent the usual concept of person, i.e. first, second, or third. Story and Naish identified a fourth person, but this term is inappropriate since they did not describe a clear separation between the so-called fourth person and the other impersonal pronominals.

When analyzing a sentence, the pronominal type is given first, then the form (subject, object, independent) is given following a period. This uniquely represents the pronominal as a two dimensional unit. Thus 1 is the first person singular subject pronominal, realized as &quot;xhat&quot;. The does not uniquely identify one of the two reciprocal pronominals, but since they are both phonetically identical as &quot;woosh&quot;, it is generally unnecessary to uniquely identify them.

There is also a notional zeroth person which can be of subject, object, or independent form. This is not realized in Tlingit, instead it is an empty placeholder for analysis.

====Subject pronominals====

The subject pronominals are all incorporated into the verb. Thus when the subject is represented as a pronominal, the subject position of the sentence is empty.

====Object pronominals====

Object pronominals are divided into three classes, the verbal, nominal, and postpositional.

The verbal object pronominals function similarly to the subject pronominals in that they preclude an explicit object when used.

The nominal object pronominals are similar in some respects to the possessive pronouns of English. They precede a noun and represent the object of the noun, typically implying possession of the noun.

Postpositional object pronominals function as objects to which postpositions are attached. They act as the object of a postposition in a manner similar to an ordinary noun suffixed with a postposition.

===Directionals===

Strictly speaking, the Tlingit directionals can be classified as nouns on the basis of their syntactic function. However, they form a distinct semantic set of nouns which indicate direction relative to some stated position. They also show stem variation depending locative suffixation, in particular with the allative suffix &quot;-dei&quot;. These stem variants also occur with the adverb construction &quot;N1&quot;-da-&quot;N2&quot;-(i)n &quot;&quot;N2&quot; &quot;N1&quot;-ward&quot; where &quot;N2&quot; is an anatomic noun and &quot;N1&quot; is a directional stem.

===Particles===

Particles function as neither noun nor verb. They are restricted to positions relative to phrases in the sentence.

====Focus particles====

The focus particles follow the left periphery (&quot;forephrase&quot; per Leer) of a sentence. The Naish-Story term for them is &quot;post-marginals&quot;. Many of them may be suffixed with a demonstrative (&quot;-yá&quot;, &quot;-hé&quot;, &quot;-wé&quot;, &quot;-yú&quot;), and they may also be combined with the interrogative (&quot;-gé&quot;). Focus particles are stylistically written as separate words, but phonetically, they may be indivisible from the preceding utterance.

* &quot;sá&quot; — wh-question
* &quot;gé&quot; — dubitative, unlikelihood, &quot;perhaps&quot;, &quot;maybe, &quot;it would seem...&quot;
* &quot;á&quot; — focus
* &quot;ágé&quot; — interrogative (&lt; &quot;á&quot; + &quot;gé&quot;)
* &quot;ásé&quot; — discovery, understanding of previously unclear information, &quot;oh, so...&quot;
* &quot;ásgé&quot; — second hand information, &quot;I hear...&quot;, &quot;they say...&quot; (&lt; &quot;ásé&quot; + &quot;gé&quot;)
* &quot;khu.aa&quot; — contrastive, &quot;however&quot;
* &quot;xháa&quot; – softening, &quot;you see&quot;
* &quot;shágdéi&quot; — dubitative, likelihood, &quot;perhaps&quot;, &quot;probably&quot;
* &quot;dágáa&quot; — emphatic assertion, &quot;indeed&quot;, &quot;for sure&quot;
* &quot;shéi&quot; — mild surprise
* &quot;gwáa&quot;, &quot;gu.áa&quot; — strong surprise
* &quot;gwshéi&quot;, &quot;gushéi&quot; — rhetorical interrogative, request for corroboration, &quot;I wonder&quot;, &quot;perhaps&quot;
* &quot;óosh&quot; — hypothetical, &quot;as if&quot;, &quot;even if&quot;, &quot;if only&quot;

The combination of the focus &quot;á&quot; with the demonstratives gives the frequently used particles &quot;áyá&quot; and &quot;áwé&quot;, and the less common &quot;áhé&quot; and &quot;áyú&quot;. Combination of the interrogative &quot;ágé&quot; with the demonstratives gives the confirmative particles &quot;ákwé&quot; and &quot;ákyá&quot; (&quot;ák-hé&quot; and &quot;ákyú&quot; are uncommon), used to elicit a yes/no response from the listener.

The interrogative &quot;ágé&quot; also usually contracts to &quot;ág&quot; before &quot;tsú&quot; &quot;also&quot;: &quot;ág tsú&quot; &quot;also?&quot; &lt; &quot;ágé&quot; + &quot;tsú&quot;.

The particle &quot;sá&quot; is obligatory in forming wh-question phrases. It can be combined with a demonstrative, the dubitative, the rhetorical interrogative, and the emphatic assertion:

* &quot;sáwé&quot; (&lt; &quot;sá&quot; + &quot;áwé&quot;), &quot;sáyá&quot;, ... — focused question, &quot;... is that?&quot;
* &quot;sgé&quot; (&lt; &quot;sá&quot; + &quot;gé&quot;) — dubitative question, &quot;maybe?&quot;, &quot;perhaps?&quot;
* &quot;ságwshéi&quot; — &quot;I wonder?&quot;
* &quot;sdágáa&quot; (&lt; &quot;sá&quot; + &quot;dágáa&quot;) — &quot;(what) on earth?&quot;, &quot;really?&quot;

====Phrasal particles====

Phrasal particles may occur after focus particles that occur with or without demonstrative finals. The following are postphrasal particles, thus they may only occur after the phrase that they modify.

* &quot;tsá&quot; — &quot;only then&quot;
* &quot;tsú&quot; — &quot;also&quot;
* &quot;s&#x27;é&quot; — &quot;first&quot;, &quot;really!&quot;
* &quot;déi&quot; — &quot;now&quot;, &quot;this time&quot;
* &quot;x&#x27;wán&quot; — &quot;be sure to&quot;
* &quot;tsé&quot; — &quot;be sure not to&quot;

Except for &quot;x&#x27;wán&quot; and &quot;tsé&quot;, the above may occur after the focus particles.

The following are prephrasal particles, i.e. they occur before the phrase that they modify. Naish and Story call these &quot;pre-marginals&quot;.

* &quot;ch&#x27;a&quot; — &quot;just&quot;, &quot;the very&quot;
* &quot;ch&#x27;as&quot; — &quot;only&quot;, &quot;just&quot;
* &quot;ch&#x27;ú&quot; — &quot;even&quot;
* &quot;tlaxh&quot; — &quot;very&quot;

====Mobile particles====

These particles may occur before or after any phrase in a clause.

* &quot;tlei&quot; — &quot;just,&quot; &quot;simply,&quot; &quot;just then&quot;
* &quot;déi&quot; — &quot;already,&quot; &quot;by now&quot;
* &quot;tsu&quot; — &quot;again&quot;, &quot;still&quot;, &quot;some more&quot;

Compare the mobile particle &quot;tsu&quot; with the postphrasal particle &quot;tsú&quot;. Both the sentence &quot;káaxwei tsu eetéenaxh xhat yatee&quot; &quot;I need more coffee&quot; and the sentence &quot;káaxwei tsú eetéenaxh xhat yatee&quot; &quot;I also need coffee&quot; are acceptable. However the sentence &quot;*tsú káaxwei eetéenaxh xhat yatee&quot; is syntactically inadmissible because the particle &quot;tsú&quot; is postphrasal, i.e. it cannot precede the phrase it modifies, in this case the noun phrase &quot;káaxwei&quot;. The corresponding sentence with the &quot;tsu&quot; particle in front, &quot;tsu káaxwei eetéenaxh xhat yatee&quot; &quot;I need coffee again/still&quot; is in contrast syntactically acceptable. Thus a Tlingit listener will recognize the &quot;tsu&quot; particle in a phrase-initial position without confusion but tone is necessary to distinguish it in a phrase-final position. For this reason the &quot;tsu&quot; particle is often used prephrasally although it is syntactically admitted in either position. Thus the song name &quot;Tsu Héidei Shugaxhtootaan&quot; could also be &quot;héidei tsu shugaxhtootaan&quot;, but placing the &quot;tsu&quot; in front has the advantage of unambiguity, and thus seems more euphonious to native speakers.

====Sentence-initial particles====

These particles may only occur at the front of a sentence. Naish-Story term these &quot;clause marginals&quot;.

* &quot;tléik&quot;, &quot;l&quot; — negative, &quot;not&quot;
* &quot;gwál&quot; — dubitative, &quot;perhaps&quot;
* &quot;gu.aal&quot; — optative, &quot;hopefully&quot;
* &quot;khaju&quot;, &quot;xhaju&quot; — contrary, &quot;actually&quot;, &quot;in fact&quot;
* &quot;khashde&quot; — &quot;I thought...&quot;

==Tlingit-language media==
The Irish TV series &quot;An Klondike&quot; (2015–17), set in Canada in the 1890s, contains Tlingit dialogue.

The American comedy-drama Northern Exposure contains Tlingit dialogue.

In 2023, the Central Council of the Tlingit &amp; Haida Indian Tribes (Tlingit &amp; Haida) announced the release of the first of nine Tlingit-language children&#x27;s books and animated videos. As a collaborative effort between Tlingit &amp; Haida, the Goldbelt Heritage Foundation, Cedar Group, and illustrators Kelsey Mata and Nick Alan Foote, the project is funded under a three-year grant through the United States Department of Education&#x27;s Alaska Native Education Program. The first book is titled &quot;Kuhaantí (2023)&quot; and was released on October 27, 2023.

<doc id="740095" wikidata="Q478603" url="?curid=740095" title="Northrop Grumman Pegasus">
<text>Pegasus is an air-launched multistage rocket developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) and later built and launched by Northrop Grumman. Pegasus is the world&#x27;s first privately developed orbital launch vehicle. Capable of carrying small payloads of up to into low Earth orbit, Pegasus first flew in 1990 and remained active . The vehicle consists of three solid propellant stages and an optional monopropellant fourth stage. Pegasus is released from its carrier aircraft at approximately using a first stage wing and a tail to provide lift and altitude control while in the atmosphere. The first stage does not have a thrust vector control (TVC) system.

== History ==
Pegasus was designed by a team led by Antonio Elias. The Pegasus&#x27;s three Orion solid motors were developed by Hercules Aerospace (later Alliant Techsystems) specifically for the Pegasus launcher but using advanced carbon fiber, propellant formulation and case insulation technologies originally developed for the terminated USAF Small ICBM program. The wing and fins&#x27; structures were designed by Burt Rutan and his company, Scaled Composites, which manufactured them for Orbital.

* Mass: 18,500 kg (Pegasus), 23,130 kg (Pegasus XL)
* Length: 16.9 m (Pegasus), 17.6 m (Pegasus XL)
* Diameter: 1.27 m
* Wing span: 6.7 m
* Payload: 443 kg (1.18 m diameter, 2.13 m length)

Started in the spring of 1987, the development project was funded by Orbital Sciences Corporation and Hercules Aerospace, and did not receive any government funding. Government funding was received to support operational testing. NASA did provide the use of the B-52 carrier aircraft on a cost-reimbursable basis during the development (captive carry tests) and the first few flights. Two Orbital internal projects, the Orbcomm communications constellation and the OrbView observation satellites, served as anchor customers to help justify the private funding.

There were no Pegasus test launches prior to the first operational launch on 5 April 1990 with NASA test pilot and former astronaut Gordon Fullerton in command of the carrier aircraft. Initially, a NASA-owned B-52 Stratofortress NB-008 served as the carrier aircraft. By 1994, Orbital had transitioned to their &quot;Stargazer&quot; L-1011, a converted airliner which was formerly owned by Air Canada. The name &quot;Stargazer&quot; is an homage to the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;: the character Jean-Luc Picard was captain of a ship named &quot;Stargazer&quot; prior to the events of the series, and his first officer William Riker once served aboard a ship named &quot;Pegasus&quot;.

During its 45-launch history, the Pegasus program had three mission failures (STEP-1, STEP-2 and HETI/SAC-B), and two partial failures, (USAF Microsat and STEP-2) followed by 30 consecutive successful flights for a total program success rate of 89 percent. The first partial failure on 17 July 1991 caused the seven USAF microsatellites to be delivered to a lower than planned orbit, significantly reducing the mission lifetime. The last mission failure on 4 November 1996 resulted in the loss of gamma-burst identifying satellite HETE (High Energy Transient Explorer).


The Pegasus XL, introduced in 1994 has lengthened stages to increase payload performance. In the Pegasus XL, the first and second stages are lengthened into the Orion 50SXL and Orion 50XL, respectively. Higher stages are unchanged; flight operations are similar. The wing is strengthened slightly to handle the higher weight. The standard Pegasus has been discontinued; the Pegasus XL is still active as of 2019. Pegasus has flown 44 missions in both configurations, launching 91 satellites as of October 12, 2019.

Dual payloads can be launched, with a canister that encloses the lower spacecraft and mounts the upper spacecraft. The upper spacecraft deploys, the canister opens, then the lower spacecraft separates from the third-stage adapter. Since the fairing is unchanged for cost and aerodynamic reasons, each of the two payloads must be relatively compact. Other multiple-satellite launches involve &quot;self-stacking&quot; configurations, such as the ORBCOMM spacecraft.

For their work in developing the rocket, the Pegasus team led by Antonio Elias was awarded the 1991 National Medal of Technology by U.S. President George H. W. Bush.

The initial launch price offered was US$6 million, without options or a HAPS (Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System) maneuvering stage. With the enlargement to Pegasus XL and the associated improvements to the vehicle, baseline prices increased. In addition, customers usually purchase additional services, such as extra testing, design and analysis, and launch-site support.

As of 2015, the most recent Pegasus XL to be purchased — a planned June 2017 launch of NASA&#x27;s Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) mission — had a total cost of US$56.3 million, which NASA notes includes &quot;firm-fixed launch service costs, spacecraft processing, payload integration, tracking, data and telemetry and other launch support requirements&quot;. A series of technical problems delayed this launch, which finally took place on 11 October 2019.

In July 2019, it was announced that Northrop Grumman had lost the launch contract of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite to SpaceX. IXPE had been planned to be launched by a Pegasus XL rocket, and had been designed so as to fit within the Pegasus XL rocket constraints. With the IXPE launch removed from the Pegasus XL rocket, there are currently (as of 12 October 2019, after the launch of ICON) no space launch missions announced for the Pegasus XL rocket. The future (under construction as of 2019) NASA Explorer program mission Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) was planned to be launched by Pegasus XL; but then NASA decided to merge the launches of PUNCH and another Explorer mission, Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites (TRACERS) (also under construction as of 2019). These two space missions, consisting of 6 satellites in total, are to be launched by one launch vehicle. It is expected that a larger launcher will be chosen for this dual mission launch. In August 2022 NASA announced that the 4 microsatellites of the PUNCH constellation will be launched as rideshare payloads together with SPHEREx in April 2025 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

Northrop has one Pegasus XL remaining in its inventory. It is looking for customers for those rockets. Northrop does not plan on retiring the Pegasus XL rocket as of October 2019.

== Launch profile ==

In a Pegasus launch, the carrier aircraft takes off from a runway with support and checkout facilities. Such locations have included Kennedy Space Center / Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida; Vandenberg Air Force Base and Dryden Flight Research Center, California; Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia; Kwajalein Range in the Pacific Ocean, and the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Orbital offers launches from Alcantara, Brazil, but no known customers have performed any.

Upon reaching a predetermined staging time, location, and velocity the aircraft releases the Pegasus. After five seconds of free-fall, the first stage ignites and the vehicle pitches up. The 45-degree delta wing (of carbon composite construction and double-wedge airfoil) aids pitch-up and provides some lift. The tail fins provide steering for first-stage flight, as the Orion 50S motor does not have a thrust-vectoring nozzle.

Approximately 1 minute and 17 seconds later, the Orion 50S motor burns out. The vehicle is at over 200,000 feet (61 km) in altitude and hypersonic speed. The first stage falls away, taking the wing and tail surfaces, and the second stage ignites. The Orion 50 burns for approximately 1 minute and 18 seconds. Attitude control is by thrust vectoring the Orion 50 motor around two axes, pitch and yaw; roll control is provided by nitrogen thrusters on the third stage.

Midway through second-stage flight, the launcher has reached a near-vacuum altitude. The fairing splits and falls away, uncovering the payload and third stage. Upon burnout of the second-stage motor, the stack coasts until reaching a suitable point in its trajectory, depending on mission. Then the Orion 50 is discarded, and the third stage&#x27;s Orion 38 motor ignites. It too has a thrust-vectoring nozzle, assisted by the nitrogen thrusters for roll. After approximately 64 seconds, the third stage burns out.

A fourth stage is sometimes added for a higher altitude, finer altitude accuracy, or more complex maneuvers. The HAPS (Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System) is powered by three restartable, monopropellant hydrazine thrusters. As with dual launches, the HAPS cuts into the fixed volume available for payload. In at least one instance, the spacecraft was built around the HAPS.

Guidance is via a 32-bit computer and an IMU. A GPS receiver gives additional information. Due to the air launch and wing lift, the first-stage flight algorithm is custom-designed. The second- and third-stage trajectories are ballistic, and their guidance is derived from a Space Shuttle algorithm.

== Carrier aircraft ==
The carrier aircraft (initially a NASA B-52, now an L-1011 owned by Northrop Grumman) serves as a booster to increase payloads at reduced cost. is only about 4% of a low Earth orbital altitude, and the subsonic aircraft reaches only about 3% of orbital velocity, yet by delivering the launch vehicle to this speed and altitude, the reusable aircraft replaces a costly first-stage booster.

In October 2016, Orbital ATK announced a partnership with Stratolaunch Systems to launch Pegasus-XL rockets from the giant Scaled Composites Stratolaunch, which could launch up to three Pegasus-XL rockets on a single flight.

== Related projects ==
Pegasus components have also been the basis of other Orbital Sciences Corporation launchers. The ground-launched Taurus rocket places the Pegasus stages and a larger fairing atop a Castor 120 first stage, derived from the first stage of the MX &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; missile. Initial launches used refurbished MX first stages.

The Minotaur I, also ground-launched, is a combination of stages from Taurus launchers and Minuteman missiles, hence the name. The first two stages are from a Minuteman II; the upper stages are Orion 50XL and 38. Due to the use of surplus military rocket motors, it is only used for U.S. Government and government-sponsored payloads.

A third vehicle is dubbed Minotaur IV despite containing no Minuteman stages. It consists of a refurbished MX with an Orion 38 added as a fourth stage.

The NASA X-43A hypersonic test vehicles were boosted by Pegasus first stages. The upper stages were replaced by exposed models of a scramjet-powered vehicle. The Orion stages boosted the X-43 to its ignition speed and altitude, and were discarded. After firing the scramjet and gathering flight data, the test vehicles also fell into the Pacific.

The most numerous derivative of Pegasus is the booster for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GBMD) interceptor, basically a vertical (silo) launched Pegasus minus wing and fins, and with the first stage modified by addition of a Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system.

== Launch history ==
Pegasus has flown 45 missions between 1990 and 2021.



== Launch failures ==
* Flight F-6, 27 June 1994: The vehicle lost control 35 seconds into flight, telemetry downlink lost 38 seconds into flight, range safety commanded flight termination 39 seconds into flight. The likely reason for loss of control was improper aerodynamic modelling of the longer (XL) version of which this was the first flight. The Pegasus carried the DoD Space Test Program&#x27;s satellite - Space Test Experiments Platform, Mission 1 (STEP-1).
* Flight F-9, 22 June 1995: The interstage ring between the 1st and 2nd stages did not separate, constraining movement of the 2nd-stage nozzle. As a result, the rocket deviated from its intended trajectory and was ultimately destroyed by range safety. The Pegasus carried the DoD Space Test Program&#x27;s satellite - Space Test Experiments Platform, Mission 3 (STEP-3).
* Flight F-14, 4 November 1996: Failed to separate payloads because of a discharged battery intended to start separation pyros. Battery damage during launch was the likely reason. The lost payloads were the High Energy Transient Explorer and Argentina&#x27;s SAC-B satellite.

== Partial successes ==
* Flight F-2, 17 July 1991: A faulty pyrotechnic system caused the rocket to veer off course during 1st-stage separation, resulting erratic maneuvers that prevented the rocket reaching the correct orbit, and the mission life, planned for 3 years, was reduced to 6 months.
* Flight F-5, 19 May 1994: A software navigation error caused the HAPS upper stage to shut down early, resulting in a lower than planned orbit. The Pegasus carried the DoD Space Test Program&#x27;s satellite - Space Test Experiments Platform, Mission 2 (STEP-2).

<doc id="740100" wikidata="Q203240" url="?curid=740100" title="Sakura Haruno">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;is a fictional character in the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Sakura is depicted as a kunoichi affiliated with and a part of Team 7, which consists of herself, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and their &quot;sensei&quot; Kakashi Hatake. Besides the main series, Sakura has appeared in several pieces of the &quot;Naruto&quot; media, most notably the spin-off &quot;&quot; (2015) and the sequel &quot;&quot; (2016) where she married Sasuke Uchiha taking name of and is the mother of their daughter, Sarada Uchiha.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Sakura is depicted as an innocent girl who does not share the same tragic backstories as her teammates but was regardless bullied throughout her youth. She initially has an infatuation for Sasuke, him at every juncture, and initially is not ambitious, besides becoming Sasuke&#x27;s girlfriend in the future; by contrast, she is dismissive to her less-skilled teammate Naruto Uzumaki despite, ironically, being Naruto&#x27;s initial love interest and disgust him. Over the course of the series, as Sasuke eventually leaves the village, Sakura begins to shed this singularly driven persona, becoming a medical ninja while apprenticed under the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade, and becomes friendly and even protective of Naruto as his life becomes increasingly at risk.

Sakura serves as the series&#x27; female lead, although she was not immediately intended for the role. Kishimoto had difficulty drawing her character, resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead which was written into her character. In order to make the character more appealing in the second part of the series, Kishimoto designed her costume in a way that makes her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.

Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Sakura&#x27;s character. She was initially noted to be a stereotypical shōnen character, representing a love interest for the protagonist, and was said to serve little purpose at the beginning of the series beyond being comic relief. Her emergence from this stereotype as the series progressed, thanks to her training with Tsunade, which leads her to develop her medical and combat skills, has been celebrated by many reviewers. Amongst the &quot;Naruto&quot; reader base, Sakura has been popular, placing high in some polls. Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Sakura&#x27;s likeness, such as action figures and key chains.

==Creation and conception==

Although Sakura Haruno is the most recurring female character in &quot;Naruto&quot;, Masashi Kishimoto did not originally intend for Sakura to be the heroine of the series. Kishimoto attributed this to him being unable to draw good heroine characters and fashioned Sakura as a girl who could not understand men, the best example of a heroine he could come up with. Sakura&#x27;s creation is a result of Kishimoto&#x27;s desire to make a somewhat irritating character who was well-intentioned. Despite these elements, Kishimoto is fond of Sakura, as he feels that many of her personality traits are common among all people, thus giving her a sense of real humanity. When asked in an interview if there was something about Sakura&#x27;s background that had not been revealed, Kishimoto explained that he had never thought of that as Sakura is a &quot;normal girl&quot;. Kishimoto has often been asked by readers about why he did not show Sakura&#x27;s parents until the film &quot;Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie&quot;. In response, he said this would not be entertaining as Sakura did not belong to any clan unlike other characters so her parents were civilians.
When designing Sakura, Kishimoto focused on her silhouette and created a costume as simple as possible. This is a divergence from the other main characters of the series, whose costumes are very detailed. The leggings are the most notable aspect of her design, as they are meant to show that she is very active. At the start of the series, her leggings extended below her knees and closely resembled trousers. As Part I progressed, the leggings became increasingly shorter and tighter. Similar to his inexperience in drawing heroines, Kishimoto lacked the experience needed to make Sakura &quot;cute&quot; when he first began drawing her; although he implied that her appearance had become cuter since then, Kishimoto and much of the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga staff agreed that Sakura had been &quot;far from cute&quot; at the start of the series. In retrospective, he found Sakura one of the hardest characters to draw, alongside Sasuke Uchiha. Kishimoto first planned Sasuke and Sakura&#x27;s romance in the early production of &quot;Naruto&quot;. In regards to Sakura&#x27;s feelings for Sasuke, Kishimoto tried to write them as realistic as possible but ended up getting complaints from young girls about her.

Sakura&#x27;s most well-known physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, because of this Kishimoto at times focuses too much on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still had a Chinaesque feeling to it, so as to make her more feminine. During Part II&#x27;s last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten-Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto decided that Hinata Hyuga, whom he acknowledged had more popularity, would take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end up together since the early stages of the manga, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting to throw Sakura in the middle to form &quot;a messy love triangle.&quot; Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what he wanted his series to focus on. In the middle of the manga&#x27;s final arc, Sakura is given a love letter. The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.

In the animated versions of &quot;Naruto&quot;, Sakura was voiced by Chie Nakamura. Early in the first series, the actors were told by Kishimoto that Sakura would end up marrying Sasuke. Nonetheless, most of them started having doubts as during the first anime, Sasuke abandoned his teammates. As a result, by the second series, Nakamura was often asked by other people if her character would instead end up with Naruto. When Sakura married Sasuke in the end, Nakamura was happy because Sakura stayed true to her feelings. In an interview, Kate Higgins, who does the voice acting for Sakura in the English dub, remarked the development of Sakura in the series, stating that she turned into a more complex character as she became more sensitive and caring.

==Appearances==

===In &quot;Naruto&quot;===
Sakura is a young ninja who is a part of Team 7 alongside Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha under the leadership of their &quot;sensei&quot; Kakashi Hatake. Within Sakura resides &quot;Inner Sakura&quot;, a manifestation of her inner emotions; in addition to comic relief, Inner Sakura represents Sakura&#x27;s actual opinion on things when she outwardly displays something opposite. As Sakura has a deep infatuation for Sasuke, many of her earlier appearances are dedicated to her continued effort to win his affection. She accompanies the rest of Team 7 during all of its early missions, though she does little to contribute to the battles that take place. Sakura lacks any unique traits that would set her apart from the rest of Team 7, although Kakashi notes that she has an excellent control over her chakra early in Part I. As a result, Sakura stays on the sidelines, content in allowing her teammates to protect her and defeat their opponents. During the Chunin Exams, when the rest of Team 7 is left in need of her protection, Sakura realizes that relying on others to fight her battles has been unwise. She resolves to better her ninja abilities from that point further, and she takes a more active role in Team 7&#x27;s battles throughout the rest of the series. After Sasuke&#x27;s defection from Konohagakure at the end of Part I, Naruto&#x27;s failure to bring him back, and Sakura&#x27;s inability to help either of them, she becomes Tsunade&#x27;s apprentice so that she can do more for her teammates in the future. Since then, Sakura makes it her personal goal to bring Sasuke home.

After training under Tsunade for two-and-a-half years, Sakura acquires the ability to heal wounds, becoming one of the most experienced medical ninjas. In order to secure her survival to heal others, Sakura also develops superhuman strength by building up chakra in her fists; by storing a vast amount of Chakra in her body over 3 years, she awakens the Byakugō Seal, a jutsu considered to be the pinnacle of chakra control. Thanks to this, Sakura joins Team 7 as a medical ninja to save their ally Gaara from the criminal group Akatsuki. With help from the elder Chiyo, Sakura defeats the Akatsuki member Sasori, who gives her hints of Sasuke&#x27;s whereabouts. The new member of Team 7, Sai, uses his intelligence to track Sasuke down, but once again they are unable to prevent him from escaping. While disappointed in their failure, Team 7 tries once again to find Sasuke, although after almost apprehending him they lose his trail and are forced to return home. As they search for Sasuke, Sakura learns of the various hardships Naruto faces because of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox creature sealed inside him, which is being pursued by the Akatsuki. Saddened by the impact both forces have had on his life, Sakura becomes protective of Naruto and tries to do whatever she can to help him overcome these obstacles. Sakura later resolves to kill Sasuke after understanding he is becoming a menace to the villages. However, when she fails to do it, Naruto decides to settle things with Sasuke himself. When a war against the remaining Akatsuki is announced, Sakura participates as a medical ninja. She later moves to the fighting side when the Ten-Tails creature is released, and she battles it alongside Naruto and Sasuke. After Sasuke is pardoned for his crimes, Sakura sees him off as he decides to travel the world in search for redemption and shows signs that he finally accepts her feelings for him; he pokes her forehead and thanks her right before his departure. In the epilogue, set years after the end of the Fourth Ninja War, it is shown that Sakura and Sasuke had married and had a daughter, Sarada Uchiha.

===In other media===
Sakura has made several appearances outside of the &quot;Naruto&quot; anime and manga. She is in all eleven feature films of the series: in the first film — &quot;Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow&quot; (2004), she battles Mizore Fuyukuma and later defeats him; in the second — &quot;Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel&quot; (2005), she helps Naruto and Shikamaru Nara in their battle against Haido and his subordinates; the third — Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom (2006) — has Sakura battling the hired ninja Karenbana, whom she defeats using her enhanced strength; in the fourth — &quot;Naruto Shippuden the Movie&quot; (2007), Sakura, Naruto, Rock Lee, and Neji Hyuga are assigned to escort the maiden Shion; in the fifth — &quot;Naruto Shippuden the Movie: Bonds&quot; (2008), Sakura is assigned alongside Naruto and Hinata Hyuga to help a girl, Amaru, and her &quot;sensei&quot;, Shinnō, return to their village while in the process learning of an upcoming invasion of the Sky Country; the sixth — &quot;Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire&quot; (2009) — has Sakura and Naruto desperately following and trying to bring back their &quot;sensei&quot;, Kakashi, who has gone on a suicide mission to prevent the Fourth Great Ninja World War; in the seventh — &quot;Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Lost Tower&quot; (2010), Sakura and the rest of Team Kakashi are sent to capture a missing-nin, Mukade; in the eighth — &quot;Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison&quot; (2011), Sakura assists in the battle against the demon Satori who has been released from the Box of Enlightenment; in the ninth — &quot;Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie&quot; (2012), Sakura and Naruto are transported to an illusion world by Obito Uchiha in which instead of Naruto&#x27;s parents, Sakura&#x27;s parents were the ones who sacrificed their lives in preventing the Nine-Tails from destroying Konohagakure and were thus deemed as the village&#x27;s heroes; in the tenth — &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; (2014), Sakura, in her young adult years, sets out alongside Naruto, Sai, Shikamaru, and Hinata to rescue a kidnapped Hanabi Hyuga, Hinata&#x27;s younger sister; and finally, in the eleventh — &quot;&quot; (2015), Sakura watches her daughter&#x27;s participation in the Chunin Exams.

She is also present in all three of the original video animations produced for the series, helping Naruto and Konohamaru to find a four-leaf clover in the first original video animation, joining her team in escorting a ninja named Shibuki to his village and helping him fight the missing-nin that stole the village&#x27;s &quot;Hero&#x27;s Water&quot; in the second, and participating in a tournament in the third. A light novel titled &quot;Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze&quot; (2015), written by Tomohito Ōsaki and illustrated by Kishimoto, focuses on Sakura sometime after the events of &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot;, where she, now a celebrated medical ninja who is in the middle of opening a new mental clinic with Ino Yamanaka, becomes worried when a conspiracy that threatens to destroy Konohagakure is using Sasuke as a scapegoat, potentially ruining his chance at redemption amongst the villagers. In &quot;&quot; (2015), Sasuke&#x27;s travels keep him away from his family. As a result, his whereabouts become a touchy subject for Sakura, who assures Sarada over the years that Sasuke will return home once having completed his mission. After punching the ground in a fit of rage over Sarada asking if she and Sasuke are married, Sakura discovers her daughter has left the village in search of Sasuke. By the time she catches up to the two, they are in the presence of Shin Uchiha, whom Sakura attacks. Afterward, she is teleported away with him to his hideout, where she declines to assist him with her medical skills and pretends to be helpless in order to gain information on him. After Sakura battles Shin, she is rescued by her husband, and they return to the village following Shin&#x27;s defeat. Soon after that, Sakura and Sarada see Sasuke off to his journey. Sakura later serves as a spectator for Sarada while she participates in the Chunin Exams and saves both herself and other onlookers from falling debris, afterward healing Hinata.

Sakura is a playable character in nearly all &quot;Naruto&quot; video games, including the and the . In some games, she uses &quot;Inner Sakura&quot; in combat as well as numerous different genjutsu. &quot;&quot; (2007) marks the first appearance of Sakura in her Part II design in a video game, with the second one being &quot;&quot; (2007). Meanwhile, &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4&quot; (2016) marks the first appearance of Sakura post-Part II; specifically, her appearance in &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot;, set two years after chapter 699 of the manga.

==Reception==
In the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; character popularity polls, Sakura had many times been placed in the top ten and reached the top five once; in the most recent poll, she was ranked twelfth. Numerous pieces of merchandise based on Sakura have been released, including action figures, key chains of her Part I (&quot;Naruto&quot;) and Part II (&quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot;) appearances, and various character patches. In a poll from 2021, Sakura was voted as the 6th most popular character in &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot;. In 2023, in the first global poll, Sakura was found to be the franchise&#x27;s third most popular character overall, behind Minato Namikaze and Itachi Uchiha, and the most popular female character.

Several manga, anime and video games publications and other related media have provided praise as well as criticism on Sakura&#x27;s character. &quot;IGN&quot; writer A.E. Sparrow commented that every anime and manga benefited from a strong female presence that Sakura provided for the &quot;Naruto&quot; series, although characterizing her as &quot;stereotypically girly&quot;. In a review of episode 110 of the anime, &quot;IGN&quot; celebrated the culmination of the development of Sakura&#x27;s character throughout the series and the growing out of the &quot;girly&quot; personality. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that Sakura&#x27;s character had largely been used in the series as a form of comic relief and to often state the obvious. &quot;T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews&quot; considered Sakura to be a stereotypical echo of similar love interests of protagonists in other shōnen manga and that she was not likable. On the other hand, she was also regarded as &quot;an interesting character to throw into the mix [of &quot;Naruto&quot;]&quot; by &quot;Mania Entertainment&quot;″s Dani Moure due to how her differences with Sasuke and Naruto helped to balance Team 7. In the book &quot;New Media Literacies and Participatory Popular Culture Across Borders&quot;, Amy A. Zenger wrote that Sasuke and Sakura&#x27;s relationship was popular among fans of the series even at the time when the former had not yet reciprocated the latter&#x27;s feelings.

The character&#x27;s change in Part II (&quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot;) has been praised by &quot;Anime News Network&quot;″s Casey Brienza for being one of the most developed ones in the series, as she has become stronger than her Part I (&quot;Naruto&quot;) counterpart, which was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura&#x27;s love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented to be one of the deepest lines and parts of the story arc for bringing confusion in regard to whether her love confession claim was as serious as her intention to stop Naruto&#x27;s suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what Sakura&#x27;s real intention regarding Sasuke was, the latter having already become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura&#x27;s feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura&#x27;s part, Amy McNulty thought the spin-off manga &quot;&quot; helped to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin of &quot;Anime Now&quot; praised Sakura&#x27;s development across the series, mostly in late parts of the story due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up and especially when she becomes an adult.

Critic Yukari Fujimoto says that Sakura is an example of &quot;Naruto&quot; showing a conservative view of women. Ino, Sakura and Hinata place priority on love, treating it as more important than excelling as a ninja. Fujimoto states that during the ninja examinations, Sakura&#x27;s climactic fight with Ino, her love rival, is conducted on a purely physical level, contrasting this level of skill with the supernatural abilities displayed by her male classmates at this point. When the medical ninja Tsunade is introduced, Sakura takes on a daughter-like role, learning to heal others from Tsunade&#x27;s teaching, which Fujimoto regards as reinforcing a conservative idea of women — that women do not belong on the battlefield as warriors, only as nurses.

<doc id="740107" wikidata="Q1740" url="?curid=740107" title="Sasuke Uchiha">
<text>() is a fictional character in the &quot;Naruto&quot; manga and anime franchise created by Masashi Kishimoto. Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha clan, a notorious ninja family, and one of the most powerful, allied with . Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke&#x27;s older brother, Itachi Uchiha, before the series began, leaving Sasuke as one of the few survivors. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, Sasuke&#x27;s feelings of powerlessness force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become stronger, and to find Orochimaru. Sasuke appears in several of the series&#x27; animated feature films and related media, including video games, original video animations (OVAs), and &quot;&quot; (2015) and its manga sequel, &quot;&quot; (2016), in which he is depicted as a vigilante supporting his village and a mentor to Naruto&#x27;s son Boruto Uzumaki.

Kishimoto conceived Sasuke as a rival of the series&#x27; title character Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke&#x27;s dark character development later in the story, Kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain; he found designing the character challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him. Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the manga&#x27;s animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English.

Sasuke&#x27;s character has received mixed responses from anime and manga publications. His impressive fighting skills, plot contribution, and rivalry with Naruto Uzumaki received some praise, but he was criticized as a stereotypical rival in the mold of similar characters from other &quot;shōnen&quot; manga and as exhibiting a cold personality. Nevertheless, Sasuke&#x27;s characterization in latter parts of the story and more mature personality in the &quot;Boruto&quot; sequel earned further positive comments. Sasuke has also placed highly in &quot;Naruto&quot; reader popularity polls and has also been the subject of studies by scholars. Character-based merchandise, including action figures and key chains, have been released.

==Creation==

===Development===
Manga artist Masashi Kishimoto did not include Sasuke Uchiha in his original concept for the &quot;Naruto&quot; series, a story revolving around the character Naruto Uzumaki. Discussing the series&#x27; future, his editor, Kosuke Yahagi, advised him to add a rival character for the protagonist Naruto and he created Sasuke. The character&#x27;s first name came from Sanpei Shirato&#x27;s manga &quot;Sasuke&quot; and Sarutobi Sasuke, a fictional ninja character in Japanese children&#x27;s stories. To introduce Sasuke, Kishimoto wrote a chapter that was set before the formation of his ninja squad, Team 7. The idea was scrapped; Yahagi told Kishimoto to focus the series&#x27; first two chapters on introducing Naruto instead and the focus on Sasuke and the rest of the supporting characters were shown in the next chapters for the first time. Once creating Sasuke&#x27;s character, Kishimoto decided to use him as a protagonist rather than supporting character in order to start his development at the same time as Naruto. When plot developments made Sasuke one of the story&#x27;s antagonists, Kishimoto called him and Naruto yin and yang because of their differences and complementary natures. During this period, he was asked whether Sasuke was good or evil; he replied that Sasuke was neither and called him a &quot;very pure person.&quot; He said although some of Sasuke&#x27;s actions such as following his clan&#x27;s ideas were positive, his self-centeredness tended to cause problems with others. Since the beginning of the story&#x27;s serialization, Kishimoto planned to conclude the series with a fight between Sasuke and Naruto, but he was uncertain whether the characters would end up as friends or enemies.

Kishimoto had read a variety of manga to obtain ideas for the creation of an effective rivalry between two characters, which he incorporated into Naruto and Sasuke&#x27;s relationship. He was also inspired by his relationship with his twin brother, Seishi Kishimoto; since childhood, Masashi had worried about Seishi when he faced failure and had tried to help him. To contrast Sasuke with Naruto, Kishimoto made him less emotional and depicted him as a &quot;cool genius&quot;; he felt he had created an ideal rivalry in the pair, and when one character progressed he ensured the other did as well. Kishimoto wanted Naruto and Sasuke to seem like brothers and rivals, building on a mutual experience of childhood loneliness. Although Sasuke does not regard Naruto as a worthy opponent at first, he is surprised by Naruto&#x27;s growth and becomes fiercely competitive. In the Part I finale, their rivalry leads to a fight and they grow further apart. Kishimoto said he did not want Sasuke to recognize Naruto as an equal until later in Part II.

Although both characters had used ninja techniques throughout the series, Kishimoto wanted the two fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat for the climax of their final battle. He decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke because he had also forgiven Nagato, another former enemy. The final fight between Sasuke and Naruto was considered one of the biggest challenges ever faced by the staff from Pierrot as it took an entire month to adapt it from the manga. Director Hiroyuki Yamashita elected himself in charge of the battle which left most of the anime members relieved due to his experience. For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from CyberConnect2, the video game development studio who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4&quot;. There was a need to make every movement in the fight look realistic, giving Sasuke a scary look as well as hair movement in order to express the idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other, which confused some due to Naruto&#x27;s wish to avoid this fate. The final clash between Sasuke&#x27;s Chidori and Naruto&#x27;s Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to give the viewer a bigger emotional impact. The staff noted that following this fight, Sasuke&#x27;s face became calmer despite his initial look, giving room to explore his redemption.

Kishimoto found Sasuke a difficult character to write, requiring considerable planning. In the series finale, Sasuke leaves on a solo journey; Kishimoto later stated that in addition to atonement, Sasuke wants to discover the origin of the final antagonist, but this was not explained in the story. He planned Sasuke and Sakura Haruno&#x27;s romance early in &quot;Naruto&quot; production and decided that despite having a good relationship with his allies, Sasuke would remain a rogue ninja at the end of the series.

Kishimoto wished to further explore Sasuke&#x27;s role in the series after &quot;Naruto&quot; finale. He wanted to explain the connection between Sasuke and Sakura in the spin-off manga &quot;&quot; (2015), which focuses on their daughter, Sarada Uchiha. Despite their separation during Sasuke&#x27;s mission, which draws him away from his village, the story explains the bond between the three characters. Kishimoto focused on the final scene of the Uchiha family, which he regards as the spin-off&#x27;s most important facet. Because Sasuke had few appearances in the &quot;Naruto&quot; films, Kishimoto decided to give him a bigger role in &quot;&quot; (2015), in which he teaches Naruto&#x27;s firstborn child, Boruto Uzumaki; a reference to Piccolo and Gohan in Akira Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series and also depicted in the manga &quot;&quot; (2016). Kishimoto identified Naruto&#x27;s fights alongside Sasuke against Momoshiki as the highlights of the film and asked that the film&#x27;s staff pay close attention to those sequences. Two other scenes written by the staff which surprised Kishimoto were Sasuke&#x27;s use of one of his taijutsu moves and the combination of his Susanoo technique and Naruto&#x27;s recreation of the Nine-Tailed Fox. Another relationship the novelist Jun Esaka wanted to explore was the one Sasuke has with his wife in &quot;Sasuke Retsuden&quot; most notably in the manga adaptation where liked the focus on romance.

=== Design ===

Kishimoto regarded Sasuke as his most memorable character design because he was developed as Naruto&#x27;s opposite. He said the design of Sasuke and his ability were influenced by the character Hiei in Yoshihiro Togashi&#x27;s manga series, &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;. Sasuke originally had necklaces and ties around his arms and legs because Kishimoto had a habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible; realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to a basic contrast with Naruto&#x27;s costume. The — one of Sasuke and Kakashi Hatake&#x27;s best-known fighting techniques — originally had a different name that Kishimoto forgot. He found the name &quot;Chidori&quot; and its variant, the &quot;Lightning Blade&quot;, appropriate.

Kishimoto considered Sasuke his most challenging character to design and draw. He lacked a clear idea of how his face should look, saying Sasuke seemed older than Naruto, his contemporary, and felt this inconvenience was a result of his inexperience in drawing characters who were mature beyond their years. Sasuke&#x27;s hair, originally short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series progressed. Mid-way through Part I, he drew a new costume for Sasuke with belts strapped around his arms and legs, but he returned to the character&#x27;s original design because it took less time to draw. Sasuke is his favorite character to draw despite the time and energy required, and he compared Sasuke with Sakura in difficulty. Kishimoto&#x27;s superiors sometimes asked him to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well.
Kishimoto&#x27;s design focus for Part II was Sasuke&#x27;s older appearance. Originally, Kishimoto had wanted to draw him as a more attractive person, but the idea was discarded. An outfit he initially planned combined the younger Sasuke&#x27;s outfit with new, more modern clothes. Kishimoto tried several other looks, including the use of Shimenawa to evoke the antagonist Orochimaru, and a turtleneck and military uniform to connote cleanliness. He avoided the second option due to similarities with cold weather clothing and eventually chose Japanese clothing and a &quot;chokutō&quot; sword.

For &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot;, Kishimoto gave Sasuke a new, young-adult design with sharper facial features. In contrast with the older Naruto, who cut his hair, Sasuke&#x27;s hairstyle grew longer to cover part of the character&#x27;s face. In the original concept, the hair hid Sasuke&#x27;s mysterious left eye — the . According to Kishimoto, he decided to give the character a large hood because Sasuke concealed his identity during the events of the film. Sasuke&#x27;s design was specifically created to support his actions; the area that showed Sasuke had lost his left arm in the &quot;Naruto&quot; finale was also covered by his clothes.

===Personality and voice actors===
Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese media. At the beginning of the anime&#x27;s first part, Sugiyama had difficulty voicing Sasuke because he knew little about his personality; he began to understand the character at the point in the story where Sasuke encounters his brother, Itachi Uchiha. Sugiyama read the manga and became particularly interested in Sasuke&#x27;s development when the character left Konohagakure; he wanted to revoice some scenes from the anime, including Sasuke&#x27;s departure from Konohagakure. In &quot;Behind the Scenes of Uchiha&quot;, a feature about Sasuke and Itachi&#x27;s backstory, Sugiyama said he had become emotional during the recording sessions of the sixth season of the anime&#x27;s second part (&quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot;), in which Sasuke learns the truth about his brother&#x27;s role in the massacre of the Uchiha clan.

Sugiyama thought Sasuke&#x27;s line, &quot;You are annoying,&quot; summed up the character&#x27;s feelings toward Sakura and indicated a change in their relationship each time it was said; although she initially annoys him, he smiles when he repeats it before leaving Konohagakure. Naruto&#x27;s Japanese voice actress, Junko Takeuchi, said Sasuke&#x27;s line addressed to Sakura, &quot;See you next time... Thank you,&quot; revealed his feelings for her. Sugiyama stated that by the end of the series, Sasuke realized how much he had hurt Sakura&#x27;s feelings and apologized to her after his final fight against Naruto because of this. While recording for &quot;Boruto: Naruto the Movie&quot;, Sugiyama expected to see a bond between Sasuke and his apprentice, Boruto Uzumaki. According to Sugiyama, Sasuke&#x27;s personality had changed for the , and the actor wanted fans to see the character&#x27;s interaction with his family. Japanese rock band Scenarioart in charge of performing the ending theme song of this story arc were given directions by Pierrot to make the song show the distant but caring relationship between Sasuke and Sarada. As a result, although the lyrics often mentions the farewells Sasuke and Sarada had, the intention was meant to make it look optimistic as they are destined to meet once again.

Yuri Lowenthal, who voices Sasuke in the English dubs, said he was honored to receive the role since many actors had auditioned for it, and he added that the job was stressful. Although fans were critical of deviations and mistakes in his recordings, he enjoyed voicing the character. His first impression of Sasuke was of &quot;a serious guy dedicated to his training&quot;, but his view changed as he learned about the character&#x27;s backstory. Lowenthal said that some of Sasuke&#x27;s lines, such as his use of the word &quot;kill&quot;, were changed as Viz Media often censored parts of the series&#x27; dialogue for Western viewers. As a result, he found the original Japanese version truer to the character.

==Appearances==

===In &quot;Naruto&quot;===
====In Part I====
Sasuke is introduced in the third chapter of &quot;Naruto&quot;″s manga as a young ninja assigned to become a member of Team 7 alongside his rival Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, the latter of whom is infatuated with him. The trio are trained under the guidance of Kakashi Hatake. Although Sasuke is antisocial, cold, and distant, he starts caring about Naruto and Sakura. During a mission, Sasuke awakens his Sharingan — his clan&#x27;s inherited ability to see through illusions — which allows him to learn imperceptible movements at a superhuman rate. It is revealed later that Sasuke is the sole survivor of the once-powerful Uchiha clan of Konohagakure. He, at the age of seven, survived the massacre of his clan perpetrated by his brother, Itachi, who spared Sasuke&#x27;s life because he did not consider him worth killing. Sasuke seeks strong fighting opponents to reassure himself his power is growing.

During a ninja examination meant to improve their ranks, Team 7 encounters Orochimaru, an exile from Konohagakure who afflicts Sasuke with a Cursed Seal that contains a fragment of Orochimaru&#x27;s consciousness, which increases Sasuke&#x27;s physical abilities, but makes him cruel and sadistic. Kakashi teaches Sasuke the lightning-based offensive technique called Chidori in an attempt to appease Sasuke&#x27;s desire for power. During a siege of Konohagakure, a berserker ninja named Gaara beats Sasuke, who is rescued by Naruto. Shortly afterward, Itachi returns to the village; Sasuke tries to kill him, but he is beaten and tortured instead. Shaken by the experience he decides to leave Team 7 and Konohagakure to become stronger. Thinking Orochimaru&#x27;s training will make him more powerful, Sasuke becomes an outlaw. Naruto follows him and they fight when Sasuke refuses to return; Sasuke wins, spares Naruto&#x27;s life, and continues to Orochimaru&#x27;s hideout.

====In Part II====
After two-and-a-half years of training, Sasuke absorbs Orochimaru before he can possess his younger body. Following this, Sasuke forms Team Hebi to find Itachi. Itachi and Sasuke fight and Itachi dies at the climax of the battle from an illness. Sasuke then meets Tobi, Itachi&#x27;s superior, who reveals that Itachi killed the Uchiha clan under orders from the Leaf High Council member Danzo Shimura and spared Sasuke out of love rather than contempt. Sasuke rejoins Hebi — which he renames Taka — and declares his intention to destroy his former village in retribution. Due to his brother&#x27;s death, Sasuke&#x27;s Sharingan has evolved into a , giving him powerful new techniques. After he agrees to work temporarily for Tobi&#x27;s terrorist organization, Akatsuki, Sasuke becomes a criminal. He kills Danz, the now acting Hokage with Tobi&#x27;s aid. Sasuke is confronted by his former Team 7 colleagues, and Naruto challenges him to a death match.

Sasuke initially prepares to fight Naruto but instead decides to protect Konohagakure after he encounters the re-animated bodies of Itachi and the First Hokage Hashirama Senju. He rejoins Team 7 and fights the Ten-Tails monster that is controlled by the masterminds behind Akatsuki. Sasuke inherits the Rinnegan — a legendary eye technique — from the spirit of the Sage of the Six Paths Hagoromo Otsutsuki, the Founder of Shinobi. Team 7 fights and seals an ancient being called Kaguya Otsutsuki — Hagoromo&#x27;s mother — who created the Ten-Tails. Sasuke then fights Naruto alone to settle their village&#x27;s future; when he loses his left arm, Sasuke surrenders and reconciles with Naruto. Sasuke then destroys Akatsuki&#x27;s illusion placed on mankind with his Rinnegan. He is pardoned for his crimes by Kakashi — the current Hokage — and decides to travel the world in search of redemption. Before leaving, he says farewell to both Sakura and Naruto with gratitude. By the end of the manga, having briefly returned to the village, Sasuke is revealed to have married Sakura who is raising their daughter Sarada.

===In the &quot;Boruto&quot; franchise===
In the &quot;Naruto&quot; spin-off manga, &quot;Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring&quot;, and the &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot; anime (2017), Sasuke has left Konohagakure sometime after Sarada&#x27;s birth on a secret mission to investigate a possible threat relating to Kaguya, traveling across the world and Kaguya&#x27;s dimensions for clues while aiding the other villages in secret. In the &quot;Boruto&quot; anime, Sasuke briefly returns to his village before the arc begins and asks Naruto to offer Sakura his apologies. He rejoins Naruto to oppose Orochimaru&#x27;s former test subject Shin, who takes the Uchiha surname for his own while seeking to avenge Itachi and revive the Akatsuki to end the peace. After defeating Shin and his clone children, Sasuke bonds with his daughter for the first time and resumes his mission. A novel by Mirei Miyamoto focuses on Sasuke&#x27;s work in his village where he replaces Konohamaru Sarutobi as the leader of Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki&#x27;s team. Another novel which is being adapted into a manga is focused on a new adventure Sasuke and Sakura. The theme of Sasuke&#x27;s novel is that of &quot;a married couple&#x27;s view on life and death&quot;.

In &quot;Boruto: Naruto the Movie&quot;, also covered in both the &quot;Boruto&quot; manga and anime, Sasuke returns to Konohagakure to warn Naruto of the threat posed by Kaguya&#x27;s kinsmen Momoshiki Otsutsuki and Kinshiki Otsutsuki, who seek the tailed beast chakra for their end. He meets Naruto&#x27;s son, Boruto, and becomes the boy&#x27;s mentor once having him learn to use his father&#x27;s . When the Otsutsuki members abduct Naruto during the Chunin Exam, Sasuke is accompanied by Boruto as he and the Kage — the leaders of the ninja villages — travel to Momoshiki&#x27;s planet to save Naruto. Sasuke then aids Naruto and Boruto in defeating Momoshiki, who absorbs Kinshiki to increase his power. After Momoshiki&#x27;s defeat, Sasuke notices the enemy has placed a seal called Karma on Boruto. The anime has Sasuke searching Urashiki Otsutsuki alongside Gaara. Sasuke later discovers the connection between Kara and the Otsutsuki clan, finding that Kara possesses a Ten Tails in an alternate dimension, and then faces the leader of Kara, Jigen, together with Naruto, but the pair are badly beaten, with Sasuke being forced to escape as Naruto is sealed. Not long after Naruto is freed by Boruto and his team, the village is invaded by Isshiki Otsutsuki, Jigen&#x27;s true identity, who is searching for Kawaki. Immediately after Isshiki&#x27;s lifespan runs out during the battle, Sasuke loses his Rinnegan to surprise assault from Momoshiki, possessing Boruto&#x27;s body, but Sasuke and Kawaki help restore Boruto&#x27;s consciousness.

Sasuke investigates the wheareabouts of Code, the final member of Kara, and after returning to the village, Kawaki seals Naruto and Hinata in another dimension, and tries to kill Boruto. Sasuke arrives to stop him, but Momoshiki posseses Boruto for just a moment, allowing Kawaki to escape. Just after that, former Kara collaborator Eida accidentally alters reality using her power of Omnipotence, swapping the memories of almost the entire planet, about Boruto and Kawaki. Sasuke finds Sarada, who was not affected by the memory swap, begging her father to rescue Boruto, so he decides to trust his daughter over his own fake memories, and saves Boruto from the village. The two, seen as traitors, depart the village and train, and after a year, are attacked by Code and his army of Ten Tails clones. Boruto escapes, but Sasuke is defeated, and his chakra is devoured by a Ten Tails clone, leading to Sasuke being sealed and turned into a tree. Two years later, an evolved Divine Tree creature with Sasuke&#x27;s chakra spawns, named Hidari, who seeks to devour Sarada.

===In other media===

In the first episode, he helps Naruto and Konohamaru find a four-leaf clover; in the second, he joins Naruto&#x27;s team for a mission; he participates in a tournament in the third; and he works with Team 7 in the fourth. One OVA presents an alternate fight between Sasuke and Naruto in &quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot;. The character is present in the first two &quot;Naruto&quot; feature films; he guards a princess in &quot;Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow&quot; (2004) and makes a brief appearance in a flashback in &quot;Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel&quot; (2005). The first Part II film in which he appears is &quot;Naruto Shippuden 2: Bonds&quot; (2008). The sixth Part II film, &quot;Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie&quot; (2012), contains a flirtatious, alternate-reality version of Sasuke. In &quot;The Last: Naruto the Movie&quot; (2014), an adult Sasuke returns briefly to Konohagakure to protect it from a meteor.

He is a recurring character in the &quot;Naruto&quot; light novels and the protagonist of the manga &quot;Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf Howled&quot; (2012), which explores Sasuke&#x27;s reflections after Itachi&#x27;s death and his decision to destroy Konohagakure. In &quot;Sakura Hiden&quot; (2015), an adult Sasuke continues his journey of redemption but returns to Konohagakure out of concern for Sakura&#x27;s safety. In &quot;Akatsuki Hiden&quot; (2015), Sasuke meets two children who tell him stories about Akatsuki, and they discuss Itachi&#x27;s legacy. He is the protagonist of &quot;Sasuke Shinden&quot; (2015); he agrees to aid Konohagakure by investigating a series of disappearances, which he solves with the help of Taka and a Konohagakure ninja named Sai.

According to Taira, Sasuke would be characterized as an &quot;idiot.&quot; A new novel focused on Sasuke&#x27;s life as an adult alongside Sakura, &quot;Sasuke Retsuden: The Uchiha Descendants and the Heavenly Stardust&quot; (2019), was written by Jun Esaka.

Sasuke is a playable character in &quot;Naruto&quot; video games, including the and series. His Cursed Seal can be unlocked and activated in some games. Due to his absence from early &quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot; episodes, Sasuke has not appeared in any games based on &quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot; until the launch of &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Ninja 5&quot; (2007). Sasuke is also present in crossover games, such as &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; (2005), &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N&quot; (2006), &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot; (2006), &quot;J-Stars Victory VS&quot; (2014), and &quot;Jump Force&quot; (2019).

==Cultural impact==
===Characterization and themes===

Lowenthal said in 2010 that Sasuke was one of the first dark characters he voiced, adding, &quot;He&#x27;s sort of a hero, but he&#x27;s not the naïve, young white–hat hero.&quot; Scholars have also analyzed the character. In &quot;El Anime como elemento de Transculturación&quot;, Sasuke&#x27;s corruption from a friend of the main character to his antagonist is considered one of the major interests in the narrative as it causes Naruto a dilemma about whether or not he will have to kill him during his growth as a ninja, making it one of the best written storylines presented in the narrative. According to a study of readers&#x27; abilities to predict character types based on physical cues, Sasuke was classified as an INTJ (Myers-Briggs) character type, making him a foil for Naruto. Rik Spanjers regarded Sasuke&#x27;s dissimilarity to Naruto as tragic but wrote that the contrast between the protagonists&#x27; approaches to the world was fundamental to the plot: &quot;Naruto&#x27;s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge&quot;. According to academic Amy Plumb, Kishimoto&#x27;s references to Japanese mythology in &quot;Naruto&quot;, including the heraldic symbol of Sasuke&#x27;s clan — a fan known as an &quot;uchiwa&quot; — added layers to the story and Sasuke&#x27;s ability to &#x27;blow away&#x27; the Nine-Tailed Fox&#x27;s influence on Naruto resembled the mythological use of the fan to dispel evil. Beatriz Peña viewed Sasuke&#x27;s antagonism in the series as a result of the war theme often shown throughout the story, with the Uchihas having been slaughtered due to a possible civil war against Konohagakure, which expanded the connection between him and Naruto. &quot;My Hero Academia&quot; author Kōhei Horikoshi praised the portrayal of Sasuke alongside Naruto in the beginning as in the bodyguard mission it is made clear that Sasuke is willing to fight against several enemies while Naruto instead feels fear, being motivated to avoid acting like this again.

Tejal Suhas Bagwe from Dissertation Submitted in Partial Fulfillment
for the Degree of Masters of Arts in English describes the usage of god themed techniques within the Uchihas as major references to Japanese mythology especially when awakening the stronger Mangekyo Sharingan. Another reference is how Orochimaru becomes the mythical Yamata-no-Orochi during Sasuke&#x27;s fight against Itachi who seals Orochimaru through his own Susanoo similar to the myth. The series&#x27; final antagonist, Kaguya Otsutsuki, is based on Kaguya Hime. Similar to the references of the Sharingans, Kaguya also references Japanese mythology, with both Sasuke and Naruto being the descendants of her children in a similar fashion to Amaterasu, the powerful Goddess of the Sun, and Susanoo, the God of thunder. The contrasting relations between these two characters is a common theme within the manga, as not only this is explored through Naruto and Sasuke but also through the two other connected ninjas, Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha. Antônio Guilherme Bernardes Galletti from University of São Paulo notes Boruto starts noticing the different skills his father possesess when Sasuke has him try to learn the Rasengan which makes the skilled student find a challenging training in his life for the first time. The film makes Boruto&#x27;s character become complex when learning of the shinobi code his father and master use which was also compared to the samurais&#x27; bushido while developing a sense of individuality when deciding what to do with his life when growing up.

===Popularity===
Sasuke has ranked among the top-five &quot;Naruto&quot; characters in every &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; popularity poll of the series. Initially alternating between third and fourth places, he has finished first twice. A popularity poll on the Japanese website &quot;Charapedia&quot; ranked Sasuke and Naruto&#x27;s rivalry as the best in anime. Similarly, Sasuke was voted as the second best rival in manga and anime in a poll by &quot;Anime Anime&quot;. At New York&#x27;s 2015 Comic-Con, moderator Christopher Butcher and editor Jo Otsuki commented that Sasuke had become the series&#x27; most popular character, and Otsuki called him his favorite. Butcher wondered whether readers considered Sasuke a more-relatable character after he had embraced Naruto&#x27;s positive outlook on life in the series finale. According to Otsuki, fans regarded Sasuke&#x27;s character and abilities as &quot;cooler&quot; than those of his rival. Jacob Hope of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; (&quot;ANN&quot;) listed Sasuke and Naruto as two of the &quot;Fiercest Frenemies&quot; in anime due to their resemblance despite being adversaries and their need to engage in a mortal fight to become friends. In a Tokyo Otaku Mode poll, Sasuke was deemed the sixth best character women would want to have a date with. &quot;IGN&quot; also listed him as one of the ten best rivals in anime in general, while a poll from Anime! Anime! listed Naruto and him as one of the best rivals turned into allies. In poll from 2021, Sasuke was voted as the fifth best character from &quot;Boruto: Naruto Next Generations&quot;.

===Merchandise===
Sasuke merchandise includes key chains and figurines. &quot;Boruto&quot; film audiences were offered fans bearing images of Sasuke and his daughter, Sarada. 
To promote the video game &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4&quot;, two 1/6-scale statues depicting Sasuke and Naruto during their final clash from the series were developed by Luxembourgian company Tsume.

Japanese toy company Bandai released an action figure of Sasuke performing the Chidori move. In May 2017, Bandai launched a figurine of Sasuke performing his Susanoo eye technique, which represents the god of thunder Raijin. Studio Pierrot released artwork that was sold alongside this figure. Bandai also produced a limited-edition adult figurine of Sasuke as he appears in the &quot;Naruto&quot; finale and the &quot;Boruto&quot; franchise, which impressed Scott Green, a writer for Ain&#x27;t It Cool News and Crunchyroll.

===Critical response===
Sasuke&#x27;s character has received both praise and criticism in online and printed publications. Reviewing the series&#x27; first part, writers said they enjoyed Sasuke&#x27;s fights but disapproved of his dark personality, which resembled the stereotypical rival in &quot;shōnen&quot; manga. Critics commended the relationship between Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura; they regarded the characters as complex and mature because of their teamwork and despite their youth. Reviewers considered that the characters&#x27; tactics and the emphasis on their rivalry&#x27;s emotional undercurrents made Sasuke and Naruto&#x27;s final fight from the story&#x27;s first part one of the most entertaining in the series, and they praised the one-sided romantic relationship between Sasuke and Sakura. Although critics enjoyed Yuri Lowenthal&#x27;s voicing of Sasuke, Theron Martin of &quot;ANN&quot; said the actor had difficulty sounding younger in flashbacks.

Reviewers were more enthusiastic about Sasuke&#x27;s character in the second part of the series. Critics stated that his more-emotional demeanor and his conversation with the Nine-Tailed Fox — a creature sealed within Naruto&#x27;s body — made his scenes in &quot;Naruto: Shippuden&quot; interesting. Jason Thompson wrote that Sasuke had not become evil despite siding with the antagonist Orochimaru, lending ambiguity to his character. Writers believed Sasuke&#x27;s fights during the story&#x27;s first part&#x27;s climax against Naruto second part had a major impact on the plot and the character, and they regarded his battles as some of the franchise&#x27;s best.

The series finale garnered praise from critics for the intensified rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke because of the characters&#x27; similarities. Reviewers also applauded Sasuke&#x27;s acknowledgement of his crimes, his agreement to go to prison, and his decision to begin a journey of redemption, indicating an acceptance of responsibility for his misdeeds and a response to Sakura&#x27;s feelings. Writers thought the character&#x27;s monologue after his final fight with Naruto highlighted his deeper side and that his farewell was a satisfying ending to the final story arc.

Sasuke has continued to receive praise following the end of the &quot;Naruto&quot; series. Writers considered his fight scenes in &quot;Boruto: Naruto the Movie&quot; and in particular his teamwork with Naruto to be the best parts of the film, with its television series also received critical acclaimed to the point of finding as appealing as the final fight from &quot;Shippuden&quot; between Sasuke and Naruto. A similar assessment was made of Sasuke&#x27;s characterization as an adult; Chris Beveridge of &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; approved of his new personality. Critics also commented that Sasuke had become more caring toward his daughter, and they said the &quot;Boruto&quot; anime had developed Sasuke as a father and a husband and had solidified his relationship with his wife, Sakura, despite his flawed interaction with his family due to his mission to stop Kaguya&#x27;s followers in order to atone for his past actions and protect his hometown in the process. The storyline &quot;Sasuke Retsuden&quot; where Sasuke questions his marriage due to his constant wanderings resulted positive reactions from the media as he gives Sakura an engagement ring and the couple start acting commonly. Sasuke&#x27;s interaction with Boruto also earned praise by &quot;Anime News Network&quot; for how supportive he is on his student when Boruto is depressed about his father&#x27;s disappearance and he encourages to join his rescue team to find him. The character&#x27;s possible mortal fate in the fight against Kara was found by &quot;IGN&quot; to be a common commentary within readers who feared Sasuke dying in the narrative based on build up where he tells Boruto he and Naruto are ready to die protecting the village.

<text>The JEATH War Museum () are two war museums in Kanchanaburi, Thailand about the Death Railway, which was built from 1942 to 1943 by Allied POWs under the direction of the Japanese as part of the Thai-Burma railways. The older JEATH museum is located in the CBD area of Kanchanaburi, while the other is located near the Bridge over the River Kwai.

==Name==
The acronym JEATH stands for the primary nationalities involved in the construction of the railway: Japanese, English, Australian, American, Thai and Dutch, whereas the Thai name is Phíphítháphan Songkhram Wát Tâi (Wat Tai War Museum).

==Founding==
The museum was founded in 1977 by the chief abbot of Wat Chaichumpol Venerable Phra Theppanyasuthee. It is located on the grounds of a temple at the junction of the Khwae Yai and Khwae Noi rivers in Kanchanaburi and it is a part of the famous The Bridge over the River Kwai saga.

==The museum==
The museum is divided into two sections, one depicting the construction of the Death Railway which is meant to recreate the quarters used by Allied POWs, and the other consisting of reconstructed bamboo huts containing such items as paintings, drawings and photos of and by former prisoners, weapons, tools, and maps.

Tourist photos are not permitted in Section I of the museum.

<text>The M-94 was a piece of cryptographic equipment used by the United States Army, consisting of several lettered discs arranged as a cylinder. It was also employed by the US Navy, under the name CSP 488. 

The device was conceived by Colonel Parker Hitt and then developed by Major Joseph Mauborgne in 1917; based on a system invented by Thomas Jefferson and Etienne Bazeries. Officially adopted in 1922, it remained in use until circa 1942, when it was replaced by more complex and secure electromechanical rotor machines, particularly the M-209.

==Principle==
The device consisted of 25 aluminium discs attached to a four-and-a-half inch long rod, each disc containing the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet in scrambled order around its circumference (with the exception of the 17th disc, which began with the letters &quot;ARMY OF THE US&quot;). Each wheel had a different arrangement of the alphabet, and was stamped with an identifying number and letter; wheels were identified according to the letter following &quot;A&quot; on that wheel, from &quot;B 1&quot; to &quot;Z 25&quot;. The wheels could be assembled on the rod in any order; the ordering used during encoding comprised the key. There were &quot;25! (25 factorial) = 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000&quot; (more than 15 septillion) possible keys, which can be expressed as about an 84-bit key size.

Messages were encrypted 25 letters at a time. Turning the discs individually, the operator aligned the letters in the message horizontally. Then, any one of the remaining lines around the circumference of the cylinder was sent as the ciphertext. To decrypt, the wheels were turned until one line matched a 25 letter block of ciphertext. The plaintext would then appear on one of the other lines, which could be visually located easily, as it would be the only one likely to &quot;read.&quot;

The principle upon which the M-94/CSP-488 is based was first invented by Thomas Jefferson in 1795 in his &quot;wheel cypher&quot; but did not become well known, and was independently invented by Etienne Bazeries a century later.

==M-138-A==

In an extension of the same general principle, the M-138-A strip cipher machine, used by the US Army, Navy (as CSP-845), Coast Guard and State Department through World War II, featured hundreds of flat cardboard strips. Each strip contained a scrambled alphabet, repeated twice, that could be slid back and forth in a frame; with 30 being selected for each cipher session. The strip cipher could interoperate with the M-94 if suitable strips were provided. 

The original design used an aluminum base. William F. Friedman describes the problem of getting them manufactured and how it was overcome:

&quot;It soon became apparent to both Army and Navy cryptologists that a great increase in cryptosecurity would be obtained if the alphabets of the M-94 device could be made variant instead of invariant. There began efforts in both services to develop a practical instrument based upon this principle. I won&#x27;t take time to show all these developments but only the final form of the one adopted by the Army, Strip Cipher Device Type, M-138-A. This form used an aluminum base into which channels with overhanging edges were cut to hold cardboard strips of alphabets which could be slid easily within the channels. It may be of interest to you to learn that after I had given up in my attempts to find a firm which would
or could make such aluminum grooved devices in quantity, Mrs. Friedman, by womanly wiles
and cajolery on behalf of her own group in the U.S. Coast Guard, succeeded in inducing or enticing one firm to make them for her. And it&#x27;s how the first models of strip cipher devices
made of aluminum by the extrusion process came about, and how the U.S. Army, by administrative cooperation on an inter-Service level and technical cooperation on a marital level,
found it practical to develop and produce in quantity its Strip Cipher Device, Type M-138-A. This was used from 1935 to 1941 or 1942 by the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, et al, including the Treasury and State Departments. It was used as a back-up system even after the Armed Services as well as the Department of State began employing much better and more sophisticated cipher machines of high speed and security.&quot;
Another problem was that aluminum was in short supply early in the war and attempts were made to make the strip cipher bases out of plastic or mahogany, with limited success. Fortunately, aluminum became available again for this use in the fall of 1943.

Besides the military, Department of State and many other civilian agencies (like OSS) were using it for most important messages, and despite it being a powerful method in theory, made many mistakes so the system was compromised, letting multiple Axis countries decipher it.

==Cryptanalysis==
Like most classical ciphers, strip ciphers can be easily cracked if there is enough intercepted ciphertext. However, this takes time and specialized skills, so the M-94 was still good enough during the early years of World War II for its intended use as a &quot;tactical cipher&quot;; in a similar way to the more modern DRYAD and BATCO. The M-138-A was stronger because slips with new alphabets could be issued periodically, even by radio using more secure systems like SIGABA, however this was not practiced until the US found out that their strips were compromised in early 1943. Both were replaced by the M-209 mechanical rotor machine as these became available.

The main method of M-138-A cryptanalysis practiced by Axis, besides physically capturing the systems, was exploiting its vulnerability to the known-plaintext attack (e. g., when the same text was published in press releases), as well as the fact that the embassies used too little keys and strips.

<text>Benoît Poelvoorde (, ; born 22 September 1964) is a Belgian actor and comedian.

==Early life==
His mother was a grocer and his father a driver, who died when Poelvoorde was still a minor. He attended the Jesuit Boarding School of Godinne before he left home at 17 to take classes at the Félicien Rops Technical Institute in Namur (Belgium) where he met Rémy Belvaux. He developed a passion for theater and became noted for his atypical interpretations. Not only was he destined to become a draughtsman, he also developed professionality as a photographer. During his graphic design studies at the École de recherche graphique in Brussels, he also became friends with André Bonzel and, together with Rémy Belvaux, directed in 1988 &quot;Pas de C4 pour Daniel Daniel&quot;, his first movie, a student short film (which he co-directed and co-wrote). It was a stylized trailer for a mock-spy film.

==Career==

In 1992, Poelvoorde, Belvaux and Bonzel wrote, produced and directed together their first long feature &quot;C&#x27;est arrivé près de chez vous&quot; (&quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; internationally) originally a low-budget school graduation project (1992) and a kind of cynical satirical &quot;noir&quot; movie, inspired from the famous Belgian series &quot;Strip-Tease&quot;&quot; &quot;which went on to become a critically acclaimed cult movie. The film received the André Cavens Award for Best Film by the Belgian Film Critics Association (UCC).

Poelvoorde subsequently starred in two series on the French pay-channel Canal+ and several movies such as &quot;Les Randonneurs&quot;, &quot;Le Boulet&quot; and &quot;Podium&quot;, which made him famous in France and Belgium. In 2001, he starred in &quot;Le Vélo de Ghislain Lambert&quot;, a movie about one of his passions, bicycling. In 2002, he received the Jean Gabin Prize, which recognized the most hopeful young talents. Poelvoorde became a member of the Cannes Film Festival Jury in 2004 by request of Quentin Tarantino, a big fan of &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; who had presided over the Jury that year.

In 2005 he ranked in 7th place in the Walloon version of the Greatest Belgian. In the Flemish version he came in at nr. 400 outside the official list of nominations.

In 2008, his performance in the movie &quot;Astérix aux Jeux olympiques&quot; won him critical acclaim by both film critics and the public at large. His recurrent character as a pretentious person and a sore loser has drawn comparisons between him and the beloved French comedian Louis de Funès. Poelvoorde also played serious roles. He has starred in 2009 as Etienne Balsan in &quot;Coco avant Chanel&quot; by Anne Fontain, with Audrey Tautou; as Jean-René in 2010 with Isabelle Carré in a comedy by Jean-Pierre Améris &quot;Émotifs anonymes&quot; about two extremely shy persons who fall in love, and also as August Maquet in &quot;L&#x27;autre Dumas&quot; by Safy Nebbou, alongside Gérard Depardieu and Dominique Blanc, a movie about the creative ghostwriter, Maquet, who played a crucial role in the production of French writer Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;. 
For his work in &quot;A Place on Earth&quot; (2013), Poelvoorde received a Magritte Award for Best Actor.

He played God in the satirical movie &quot;The Brand New Testament&quot; (2015). 

==Personal life==
In November 2008, the actor suffered from depression and was briefly hospitalized at his request in the psychiatric unit of the CHR of Namur. The actor revealed in interviews that he suffers from bipolar disorder.

In 2019, during the shooting of the movie &quot;Raoul Taburin a un secret&quot;, based on the book by Jean-Jacques Sempé, Poelvoorde had a bicycle accident and received 17 stitches.
