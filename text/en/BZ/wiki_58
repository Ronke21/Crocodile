<text>Titan A.E. is a 2000 American animated science fiction action-adventure film directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, and starring Matt Damon, Bill Pullman, John Leguizamo, Nathan Lane, Janeane Garofalo and Drew Barrymore. Its title refers to the spacecraft central to the plot with &quot;A.E.&quot; meaning &quot;After Earth&quot;. The animation of the film combines traditional hand-drawn created animation with the extensive use of computer-generated imagery.

The film tells the story of a young man who receives a mission to save humanity and protect the giant ship that can create a new planet, after the hostile alien species have destroyed the planet Earth. Along the way, he joins up with a ship&#x27;s crew and their captain, who help him race against time and find the ship, before the aliens can destroy it.

Theatrically released on June 16, 2000, by 20th Century Fox in the United States as the third and final project produced by Fox Animation Studios, the film received mixed reviews from critics with praise for its visuals, cast performances and animation but criticism for its characters and story. The film was also a box office failure, grossing only $36.8 million against a budget of $75–90 million.

==Plot==

In 3028, a groundbreaking scientific project known as &quot;The Titan Project&quot; incurs the wrath of the Drej, a hostile race of aliens made of pure energy, who fear that it will allow humans to challenge them. Determined to wipe out humanity, the Drej initiate a massive attack on Earth, forcing the human race to evacuate the planet. During the evacuation, Professor Sam Tucker—head researcher on the Titan Project—leaves his young son Cale in the care of his alien friend Tek and flees Earth in the spaceship &quot;Titan&quot;. Before he leaves, he gives Cale a gold ring, promising him that there will be hope for humanity as long as he wears it. The Drej destroy Earth, and the surviving humans flee into space.

15 years later, the remnants of humanity live on as refugees, but face extinction without a home planet of their own. Ex-military officer Joseph Korso, a former friend and confidant of Sam, tracks down a jaded and cynical Cale, who works in the salvage yard of space station Tau 14. Korso reveals that a holographic map leading to the location of the &quot;Titan&quot; is encoded in Cale&#x27;s ring, and invites Cale to join the crew of his spaceship &quot;Valkyrie&quot; as they seek the &quot;Titan&quot;. Accepting Korso&#x27;s offer, Cale escapes Tau 14 with him as the Drej pursue them. On the &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, Cale befriends pilot Akima Kunimoto and three alien crew members: first mate Preedex &quot;Preed&quot; Yoa, surly weapons officer Stith, and eccentric astronomer Gune.

Cale&#x27;s map leads the crew of the &quot;Valkyrie&quot; to the planet Sesharrim, where an alien race called the Gaoul help them interpret the map, revealing that the &quot;Titan&quot; is hidden in the Andali Nebula. Drej fighters then attack the planet and abduct Cale and Akima in order to copy the map. Akima is rescued by the crew after being jettisoned by the Drej Queen, while Cale escapes the Drej mothership in a stolen fighter and makes his way back to the &quot;Valkyrie&quot;. The map changes to reveal that the &quot;Titan&quot; is hidden in the Ice Rings of Tigrin, a labyrinthine ice field in space. While resupplying at human space station New Bangkok, Cale and Akima discover that Korso and Preed have made a deal to sell the &quot;Titan&quot;&#x27;s location to the Drej. Cale and Akima manage to escape the &quot;Valkyrie&quot; and are left stranded on New Bangkok when Korso leaves for the &quot;Titan&quot;. Determined to beat Korso to the &quot;Titan&quot;, they fix up a dilapidated spaceship with help from the station&#x27;s inhabitants.

Cale and Akima navigate the ice rings of Tigrin in a race against the &quot;Valkyrie&quot; and dock with the &quot;Titan&quot;. They discover DNA of various animals onboard and a pre-recorded message left by a now-deceased Sam, explaining that the ship was designed to create planets. However, the ship&#x27;s power cells were drained during the escape from Earth, and lack the energy necessary to create a planet. The &quot;Valkyrie&quot; arrives, and Preed sets off a bomb in an attempt to kill Stith and Gune. Finding Cale and Akima, Preed reveals that he has betrayed Korso and made his own deal with the Drej. A fight ensues, and Korso kills Preed by snapping his neck. Cale and Korso fight, resulting in Korso falling over the railing.

As the Drej begin their attack on the &quot;Titan&quot;, Cale realizes that he may be able to recharge the &quot;Titan&quot; by using the Drej, as they are made of pure energy, but a circuit breaker stalls before he can complete the process. As Cale attempts to repair it, Akima, Stith and Gune fight off the Drej. Korso, who survived his fall, has a change of heart and sacrifices his life to repair the circuit breaker. Cale triggers the &quot;Titan&quot;&#x27;s systems, which absorb the Drej and their mothership, killing them. The &quot;Titan&quot; creates a new world, and Cale and Akima embrace in the rain on the newly created planet as ships filled with human colonists arrive to start a new life on the planet.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Titan A.E.&quot; was originally intended to be a live-action film tentatively titled &quot;Planet Ice&quot;, with Art Vitello hired to direct. 
By November 1997, the project had been revamped into an animated feature, with Matt Damon joining the voice cast along with Bill Pullman, Drew Barrymore, Nathan Lane, Jim Breuer, Janeane Garofalo and Lena Olin. In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Chris Meledandri, then-president of Fox Family Films, stated: &quot;The imagery would be too costly to realize in live action. It will distinguish this film, which has a cast not only of humans but also aliens. And the group of actors we&#x27;ve put together is about the finest assembled for an animated film.&quot; By September 1997, Ben Edlund had written the first screenplay draft. John August came aboard the project in February 1998, and was hired to polish the dialogue but remained on the project for further rewrites. The film&#x27;s visual effects were handled by the Blue Sky/VIFX visual effects studio, and millions had been spent on previsualization tests of the space environments and spacecraft. In February 1998, Vitello departed the project. During the summer of 1998, Bill Mechanic, then-chairman of 20th Century Fox, handed the script to Fox Animation Studios creative heads Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, who had finished directing &quot;Bartok the Magnificent&quot; (1999). Mechanic had no in-development projects for Fox Animation Studios to work on and was faced with the choice of potentially laying off the animation staff unless they took another project. Despite their inexperience with the science fiction genre, Bluth and Goldman took the script regardless. Bluth explained, &quot;When we came to Fox, one of the things that we all talked about was that we shouldn&#x27;t try to be a &#x27;Disney wanna-be&#x27;. We wanted to make a picture that&#x27;s edgier, still reaches the family and goes a little further and even brings in the teenagers.&quot; Joss Whedon, who had signed a multi-picture film and television deal with 20th Century Fox, was hired to finalize the script.

As directors, Bluth and Goldman were given a production budget of $55 million and 19 months to finish the film. Before their involvement, $30 million had been spent on pre-production. Unlike Bluth and Goldman&#x27;s previous films, the animation in &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; is predominantly computer-generated while the main characters and several backgrounds were traditionally animated. Many of the scenes were enacted by the animation staff using handbuilt props before being captured by a computer. Many scenes and backgrounds were painted by concept artist Paul Cheng, who had previously worked on &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997) and its direct-to-video spin-off &quot;Bartok the Magnificent&quot; (1999). Much like &quot;Anastasia&quot;, the storytelling and tone in &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; is much darker and edgier than Bluth and Goldman&#x27;s previous films with the film being regularly compared to Japanese anime. Although Bluth and Goldman denied any influence by anime, they have acknowledged the comparison. During production, Fox Animation Studios suffered a number of cutbacks which ultimately led to its closure in 2000. Over 300 animation staff were laid off from the studio in 1999 and as a result, much of the film&#x27;s animation was outsourced to several independent studios. Several scenes were contracted to David Paul Dozoretz&#x27;s POVDE group; the &quot;Wake Angels&quot; scene was animated by Reality Check Studios (their first feature film work) while the film&#x27;s &quot;Genesis&quot; scene was animated by Blue Sky Studios, who would later go on to produce 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Ice Age&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; film franchises as well as &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; (2015). Under pressure from executives, Bill Mechanic was dismissed from 20th Century Fox prior to &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;″s release eventuating in the closure of Fox Animation Studios on June 26, 2000, ten days after the film&#x27;s release. All these events stunted the film&#x27;s promotion and distribution.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===


The soundtrack to &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; was released on audio cassette and CD by Capitol/EMI Records on June 6, 2000 and featured 11 tracks by contemporary rock bands Lit, Powerman 5000, Electrasy, Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals, The Urge, Texas, Bliss 66, Jamiroquai, Splashdown, The Wailing Souls and Luscious Jackson.
Creed&#x27;s song &quot;Higher&quot; was played in many of the theatrical trailers for &quot;Titan A.E.&quot;, but the song did not appear either on the soundtrack or in the film itself.

===Score===
&quot;Titan A.E.&quot;″s score was composed and conducted by Graeme Revell. Although an official album containing the movie&#x27;s underscore was not originally released alongside the film, it was eventually made available for the first time on October 23, 2014 by La-La Land Records as a limited edition CD of 1,500 copies. The soundtrack contains 32 tracks and music cues, most of what Revell composed for the film, and includes two bonus tracks: an orchestra-only version of &quot;Creation&quot; and an alternative version of &quot;Prologue&quot; with a different opening.

==Release==
===Digital screening===
&quot;Titan A.E.&quot; became the first major motion picture to be screened in end-to-end digital cinema. On June 6, 2000 (ten days before the film was released) at the SuperComm 2000 trade show, the film was projected simultaneously at the trade show in Atlanta, Georgia as well as a screen in Los Angeles, California. It was sent to both screens from the 20th Century Fox production facilities in Los Angeles via a VPN.

===Home media===
&quot;Titan A.E.&quot; was released on VHS and a THX certified &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD on November 7, 2000 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which contains extras such as a commentary track by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, a &quot;Quest for Titan&quot; featurette, deleted scenes, web links, and a music video for Lit&#x27;s &quot;Over My Head&quot;. The region 1 North American version also comes with an exclusive DTS English audio track in addition to Dolby Digital 5.1 featured in most international releases. Chris Carle of IGN rated the DVD an 8 out of 10, calling the film &quot;thrilling... with some obvious plot and character flaws&quot; but called the video itself &quot;a fully-packed disc which looks and sounds great&quot; and &quot;for animation and sci-fi fans, it&#x27;s a must-have&quot;. Following Disney&#x27;s purchase of Fox, the film is available to stream on Disney+.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Titan A.E.&quot; earned nearly $9.4 million during its opening weekend, ranking in fifth place behind &quot;Shaft&quot;, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;, 20th Century Fox&#x27;s own &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The film then lost 60 percent of its audience during its second weekend, dropping to eighth place, with a gross of $3.7 million. The film grossed nearly $22.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $14 million in international markets, totaling $36.8 million worldwide. The film&#x27;s budget is estimated between $75 and $90 million. According to former Fox executive and future Illumination founder Chris Meledandri, who had supervised production of the film, &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; lost $100 million for the studio.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 103 reviews with an average rating of 5.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Great visuals, but the story feels like a cut-and-paste job of other sci-fi movies&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a score of 48 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film stars out of 4, praising it for its &quot;rousing story&quot;, &quot;largeness of spirit&quot; and &quot;lush galactic visuals [which] are beautiful in the same way photos by the Hubble Space Telescope are beautiful&quot;. He cited the Ice Rings sequence as &quot;a perfect examine of what animation can do and live-action cannot&quot;. Bob Graham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Titan A.E.&quot; comes through where it counts, in the big picture. It will fascinate anyone old enough to read comic books, and, with its dark undercurrents, sudden reversals and confrontation of an uncertain future, teens probably can identify with it.&quot; Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the animation and felt the film was an improvement over Bluth and Goldman&#x27;s previous film &quot;Anastasia&quot;, resulting in a &quot;canny attraction for genre purists, hard-core ani-heads and the mass aud for galactic adventure.&quot;

Reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Michael Wilmington stated &quot;Despite its highly derivative story, this animated saga from the Don Bluth-Gary Goldman team is done with such visual razzle-dazzle, there&#x27;s no denying it&#x27;s some kind of a technological marvel: a modern lollapalooza concocted out of old-fashioned space opera elements.&quot; Richard Corliss, in his &quot;Time&quot; magazine review, felt the film has &quot;the retro-pioneering spirit of recent [science fiction] movies&quot; and praised the animation visuals. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote the film&#x27;s &quot;rudimentary narration does work up a certain amount of propulsion. But it&#x27;s not the story that&#x27;s the story here, it&#x27;s the film&#x27;s bravura visual look. Under the joint direction of animation veterans Don Bluth and Gary Goldman and influenced, connoisseurs say, by the style of Japanese anime, &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; does an excellent job of using computer-generated effects to create a vast and wondrous outer-space world.&quot;

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a mixed review, stating: &quot;Despite some gorgeous sequences, including one set in a lake of glowing hydrogen &#x27;trees,&#x27; &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; is bland. Although crammed with action, little of it produces roller-coaster thrills of adventure and self-discovery.&quot; Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film a C, writing the story and visuals were &quot;unutterably bland ... Bluth had the right idea with those epic ice crystals, but it takes more than one F/X flash to create a universe. &quot;Titan A.E.&quot; is &quot;Star Wars&quot; pulped and mashed into flavorless kiddie corn.&quot; Dennis Lim, in his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, dismissed the film, writing it is &quot;suggestive of nothing so much as Saturday-morning TV: 2-D characters frolic in 3-D CGI spacescapes, but the handiwork is uninspired, the digi-chicanery obviously expensive but bland, the New Age odor off-putting, and the reliance on inspirational Glen Ballard power ballads fatal.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Titan A.E.&quot; won a Golden Reel Award for &quot;Best Sound Editing for an Animated Feature&quot;, and was nominated by the same organization for &quot;Best Sound Editing for Music in Animation&quot;, and a Satellite Award for &quot;Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media&quot;, losing both to &quot;Chicken Run&quot;. The film was also nominated for three Annie Awards, including &quot;Outstanding Achievement in An Animated Theatrical Feature&quot;, &quot;Effects Animation&quot;, and &quot;Production Design&quot; which it lost to &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, respectively, and was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film at 27th Saturn Awards, but lost to &quot;X-Men&quot;, another film from 20th Century Fox. Drew Barrymore was nominated for &quot;Best Voice-Over Performance&quot; by the Online Film &amp; Television Association for her role as Akima, but was beaten by Eartha Kitt from &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;.

==Cancelled video game==
A video game adaptation by Blitz Games was planned to be released for the PlayStation and PC in Fall 2000 in North America, following the film&#x27;s summer release (even receiving a mention at the end of the credits). Development on both platforms had begun in March 1999 under the film&#x27;s original title &quot;Planet Ice&quot;, and an early playable version was showcased at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. In July 2000, a spokesman from the game&#x27;s publisher Fox Interactive announced that development on the title had been halted largely due to the film&#x27;s poor box office performance which was &quot;only one of many different factors&quot; that led to its cancellation.

==Novels==
To tie-in with the film, two prequel novels written by Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta were released on February 10, 2000 by Ace Books, the same day the official novelization of the film written by Steve and Dal Perry was released. A Dark Horse Comics comic series focusing on the character Sam was also released in May 2000.

* Titan A.E.: Cale&#x27;s Story – the adventures of Cale, ending with the beginning of the film. The book chronicles Cale growing up on Vusstra (Tek&#x27;s home planet) for ten years and having to move to a different place every time the Drej attack. It also reveals how Cale became resentful of his father&#x27;s disappearance and how he came to despise &quot;drifter colonies&quot;.
* Titan A.E.: Akima&#x27;s Story – the adventures of Akima, ending with the beginning of the film. The book chronicles Akima&#x27;s life aboard drifter colonies and also reveals where she learned her karate skills, her friendship with Stith and her reason to find the &quot;Titan&quot;.

<doc id="742459" wikidata="Q6912671" url="?curid=742459" title="Mormon folk music">
<text>Mormon folk music is primarily composed of folk music which was sung by Mormon pioneers in present-day Utah from the mid-19th century through the early 20th century. A notable historical component of Utah music, the popularity of Mormon folk music declined along with traditional music nationally after the advent of music recording. However, the popularity of uniquely Mormon folk music had already begun its decline before the end of the 19th century. Mormon folk songs generally showcase pioneer-era Mormon unity and communal values.

== History of Mormon folk music ==
In 1847 Brigham Young led the first company of Mormon pioneers into what became Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Great Basin area became steadily populated by Latter-day Saints. The traditional folk ballad played an important role in the lives of Mormon pioneers and early settlers. Songs detail the life of saints from the organization of the church in New York in 1830, through life in Kirtland and Nauvoo, to the trip across the plains and life in the Salt Lake Valley. Additionally, cultural and religious themes unique to the LDS Church in some songs made Mormon folk music distinct from larger folk music in the United States, and many songs herald church leaders and promote obedience to the church&#x27;s teachings.

Songs typically had simple tunes, easy-to-recall lyrics, and broad enough appeal to be sung by contemporary Mormons. Mormon folk music mainly consisted of adaptations of popular songs, as well as of traditional folk songs from the United States and Europe. Given that many early Mormon converts came from different countries and spoke different languages, music became a way of sharing and preserving one&#x27;s cultural heritage, as well as a means of communication with others. Historical Latter-day Saint attitudes and beliefs can generally be inferred from the types and lyrics of songs they sang.

During the first generation of pioneers, instruments were limited to violins, banjos, and guitars, and so many songs would have been sung with accompaniment from these instruments or were sung a capella. The first piano was brought to Utah in 1851, and piano arrangements of many popular folk songs were written.

== Themes of songs ==
Some songs recounted the difficult trip across the plains to Utah. Like many other overland pioneers, most Mormons came west by ox or horse-driven carts, and some songs were shared between Mormon and non-Mormon pioneers. The journey was difficult and often perilous, and tragedies occurred such as that of the Martin and Willie handcart companies. Handcart pioneers often sung songs on their strenuous trip to Utah in order to keep their spirits up, and such music played a large role in pioneer community life. Many of the songs that became popular during the journey to Utah reflect the belief held by the pioneers that they were the Lord&#x27;s chosen people, and that this calling came with a responsibility to act accordingly

The songs sung by Mormon pioneers were similar to folk songs sung elsewhere. Folk music at the time typically had themes of love, courtship, and crime, along with the courage, lighthearted nature, and hopefulness of the pioneers. Also conveyed in the music is the pioneers&#x27; love for their newfound mountain home, which allowed them to build a community safe from persecution. Members of the LDS Church today still sing a modified version of the &quot;Handcart Song, set to the tune &quot;The King of the Cannibal Islands.&quot;

The hardships of the pioneers continued upon their arrival in the West, and their first few years in the Great Basin were marked by crop failure, economic hardships, health challenges, fear and animosity towards the federal government, and the push for statehood. Many folk songs from this time reflect the continued struggle of the pioneers in Utah. Other songs convey church teachings and values, such as prayer, familial love, Christian faith and brotherhood, the preaching of the gospel to others, revelation from God, and the joy of worship.

Other Mormon folk songs recount historical events such as Utah&#x27;s Black Hawk War, the construction of the first transcontinental railroad, the Mormon Battalion, the miracle of the gulls, and even imprisonment for polygamy, which was fairly common for polygamist Mormons in the 1880s. These songs were sung both for entertainment and for relaying a shared cultural experience. Songs were also used as a means of storytelling and historical preservation, and many Mormon folk songs provide a surprisingly accurate account of historical events. 

A few songs expressed the animosity of Mormons toward the United States federal government. Utah had been denied statehood until 1896 on the basis of the political unity found amongst the people of the territory and of the continued practice of polygamy. Many Utah residents at the time harbored negative feelings towards &quot;Uncle Sam,&quot; a sentiment is especially evident in songs from around 1857 contemporary to the Utah War. An example is the &quot;Doo Dah Mormon Song, set to the recognizable tune of Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Camptown Races&quot;.
==Decline of Mormon folk music==
Traditional songs in Utah were superseded by recorded and broadcast music early in the 20th century, following the trend of traditional music nationwide. However, the popularity of distinctively Mormon folk songs had already faded by this point. After Utah became a state in 1896 many Mormon folk songs—especially those expressing fear and animosity about the federal government—ceased to be prominent.

Latter-day Saints today still sing a handful of folk songs, such as the &quot;Handcart Song&quot;. Often this is done in remembrance of Pioneer Day, the anniversary of the first Mormon pioneers&#x27; arrival in Utah, and such songs serve as a tie to the past. In 1982, Brigham Young University established the Folk Music Ensemble, which was still performing as of 2021.

==Recordings and artists==
During the folk boom of the 1950s-70s, a number of artists made recordings of Mormon folk songs. Perhaps the best known of these was Rosalie Sorrels, who devoted an entire LP to the subject. The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square has also performed various Mormon folk songs, including a 2009 album of &quot;American folk hymns and spirituals.&quot; Several Utah-based folk groups, including the Three D&#x27;s, the Deseret String Band, the Beehive Band, and Otter Creek have performed traditional Mormon folk songs as part of their repertoire.

<doc id="742461" wikidata="Q19055" url="?curid=742461" title="White-tailed ptarmigan">
<text>The white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), also known as the snow quail, is the smallest bird in the grouse tribe. It is a permanent resident of high altitudes on or above the tree line and is native to Alaska and the mountainous parts of Canada and the western United States. Its plumage is cryptic and varies at different times of the year. In the summer it is speckled in gray, brown and white whereas in winter it is wholly white. At all times of year the wings, belly and tail are white. The white-tailed ptarmigan has a diet of buds, leaves, flowers and seeds. The nest is a simple depression in the ground in which up to eight eggs are laid. After hatching, the chicks soon leave the nest. At first they eat insects but later move on to an adult diet, their mother using vocalisations to help them find suitable plant food. The population seems to be stable and the IUCN lists this species as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The white-tailed ptarmigan was given the scientific name &quot;Tetrao (Lagopus) leucurus&quot; by the Arctic explorer John Richardson in 1831. It was later determined that &quot;Lagopus&quot; had sufficient distinguishing features to be regarded as a separate genus and the bird became &quot;Lagopus leucurus&quot;. Molecular studies have shown that &quot;Lagopus&quot; is monophyletic, with the rock ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus muta&quot;) and White-tailed ptarmigan being sister species. The position of the willow ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus lagopus&quot;) is less clear cut, it showing some genetic divergence over its wide range.

The genus name &quot;Lagopus&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;lagos&quot; (λαγως), meaning &quot;hare&quot;, + &quot;pous&quot; (πους), &quot;foot&quot;, in reference to the bird&#x27;s feathered legs. The species name &quot;leucura&quot; was for a long time misspelt &quot;leucurus&quot;, in the erroneous belief that the ending of &quot;Lagopus&quot; denotes masculine gender. However, as the Ancient Greek term &quot;λαγωπους&quot; is of feminine gender, and the species name has to agree with that, the feminine &quot;leucura&quot; is correct. The species name &quot;leucura&quot; is derived from the Latinized version of the Greek &quot;leukos&quot;, meaning &quot;white&quot; and &quot;oura&quot;, meaning &quot;tail&quot;, in reference to the bird&#x27;s permanently white tail.

The white-tailed ptarmigan has five recognized subspecies:
* &quot;L. l. altipetens&quot; 
* &quot;L. l. leucura&quot; 
* &quot;L. l. peninsularis&quot; 
* &quot;L. l. rainierensis&quot; 
* &quot;L. l. saxatilis&quot; 

==Description==
The white-tailed ptarmigan is the smallest of the ptarmigans and the smallest bird in the grouse tribe. It is a stocky bird with rounded wings, square-ended tail, small black beak and short legs with feathering extending to the toes. Adults are long, with the males being only slightly larger than the females. The average weight is . During the summer, the white-tailed ptarmigan is a speckled grayish brown with white underparts, tail and wings. In the fall, the plumage has turned a much more reddish-brown color and white feathers begin to grow through. By winter all the summer brown feathers are lost and the bird is completely white. A further molt in the spring precedes the breeding season and the bird returns to its summer plumage. The finely barred greyish coloration on the back makes it easy to distinguish this species from the much browner willow ptarmigan and rock ptarmigan. Both sexes maintain white tail and wing feathers all the year and males can be identified by their reddish eyecombs (fleshy growths above the eye), also present year-long. In general this bird is silent but it sometimes makes quiet, low-pitched hoots and soft clucking noises.

==Distribution==
The white-tailed ptarmigan is an alpine species, a permanent resident of the high mountains above or near the timber line. It occupies open country and flies a great deal more than forest grouse, but still prefers running to flying. It ranges from Alaska and western Canada south to northern New Mexico. Males return from their wintering areas to establish territories on spruce-willow timber line breeding grounds in April. Females arrive in early May and pairs are formed.

The white-tailed ptarmigan is the only bird in North America to reside permanently in the alpine zone. Its habitat includes areas of boulders, krummholz, snowfields, rock slides, frost-heaved soil and upland herbage. Even in winter it stays in high valleys and mountain slopes where alder, willow, birch and spruce poke through the snow cover.

The white-tailed ptarmigan was introduced into the Sierra Nevada of California and Uinta Mountains of Utah in the 1970s. It may have been native here during the early Pleistocene but became locally extinct due to climate changes with greater snow-cover in spring impacting on its breeding season. Alternatively, it may have been unable to colonize the Sierra Nevada because of the barriers provided by the Columbia River and the Great Basin, and the low altitudes of the intervening South Cascades.

The white-tailed ptarmigan was first introduced into Oregon&#x27;s Wallowa Mountains with 36 birds taken from Colorado and Washington in September 1967. A second set of 54 birds was released in September 1968 that were supplied from Colorado and British Columbia. Although a few of the birds were observed in the spring and summer of 1969 the effort to establish a population in Oregon was ultimately unsuccessful.

==Diet==
This herbivorous bird&#x27;s diet varies seasonally. Nitrogen-rich snow buttercup leaves are favored in the spring season, while willow catkins, mountain avens flowers, and chickweed blooms, other flowers and leaves, lichens and berries form the majority of the ptarmigan&#x27;s diet in the summer. Once fall and winter arrive in the region, the ptarmigan feeds on pine needles, seeds, willow and alder buds and twigs. Winter food sources have a much higher cellulose content than does summer forage, so the ptarmigan relies on bacteria-aided digestion in the cecum to extract essential nutrients. During the summer, the ptarmigan eats grit to assist in digesting plant material.

==Breeding==
White-tailed ptarmigan males are usually monogamous and remain with the same mate for one breeding season. To attract females, a male will strut and display his tail feathers. The female builds a simple scrape nest on the ground, while the male acts as a sentry to guard the area. The nest is a shallow depression in a snow-free area, generally protected from the wind and is softened with grasses and a few feathers. One side of the nest generally provides a quick escape route.

A clutch consists of two to eight eggs, which retain a cinnamon color for most of the incubation period, but develop brown spots when they are nearly ready to hatch. Males remain in the vicinity of the nest until the eggs hatch, a period of about 23 days. The precocial young leave the nest six to twelve hours after hatching. They are at first covered with down but become fully fledged in seven to ten days.

Ptarmigan chicks begin their lives eating insects. Once the chicks&#x27; digestive tracts and ceca are more fully developed, their diets shift to one of flowers and leaves. Hens choose foraging patches where plant species containing proteins are abundant. The hens call their chicks to these plants, which are critical for the growth and development of the chicks. This suggests that the hens&#x27; food calls assist in enhancing survival rates of juvenile ptarmigans. The young birds remain with their mother throughout the summer and autumn season.

==Adaptations and status==
The white-tailed ptarmigan is well-camouflaged when on the ground. In his pioneering 1909 book on the subject, &quot;Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom&quot;, the American artist Abbott Thayer wrote:

The white-tailed ptarmigan has feathers located on its feet to serve as protection from the extreme cold often experienced in the alpine tundra environment. In addition, these birds have feathers around their nostrils to warm the air prior to entry into the respiratory tract. The most obvious adaptation is this bird&#x27;s cryptic coloration, which enables it to blend in with its environment and avoid predation by golden eagles or other birds of prey. To conserve energy during the winter months, the ptarmigan avoids flight as much as possible and roosts in snowbanks.

The white-tailed ptarmigan is listed as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This is because, although populations may be in slight decline, its range is too wide and the total number of birds too large to fit the criteria for being listed as &quot;Vulnerable&quot;. This bird serves as an indicator species for the alpine tundra, and denotes overall ecosystem health. It is not a conservation concern and is abundant in alpine zones across North America, indicating that this region is not undergoing dramatic climatic, temperature, or precipitation shifts. The lack of overgrazing by cattle, the lack of human development in alpine zones, the difficulty in accessing its remote habitat, the low densities at which it occurs and the laws regarding the limits to hunting bags allow the white-tailed ptarmigan to thrive.

<text>Sally Jane Dynevor (née Whittaker; born 30 May 1963) is an English actress, she is best known for her role as Sally Metcalfe in the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which she has played since 1986. In 2022, Dynevor competed in the fourteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;.

==Early life==
Dynevor was born on 30 May 1963 in Middleton, Lancashire, to Robert and Jennifer Whittaker.

==Career==
Dynevor trained at Oldham Repertory Theatre and then the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts. In 1985 she appeared in an episode of the television series &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;, playing Wendy Cunningham, a troubled schoolgirl who becomes a heroin addict.

She has made a career out of playing Sally Webster (née Seddon), a bad girl turned tame, on the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. She made her début on the serial in January 1986 and has been with the programme ever since. Dynevor was nominated for Best TV soap Personality at the 2011 Television and Radio Industries Club Awards (TRIC Awards). She also, along with three co-stars, accepted the award for Best Storyline at the 2011 British Soap Awards which revolved around the Dobbs-Websters love triangle (this award is credited to producer, Phil Collinson). At the 2015 British Soap awards, she was nominated for Best On-Screen Partnership (with Joe Duttine), and won the award for Best Comedy Performance. In 2016, Dynevor and Joe Duttine won the award for Best On-Screen Partnership at the British Soap Awards. In October 2021, it was announced that Dynevor would be competing in the fourteenth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. She was paired with Matt Evers and they were the sixth couple to be eliminated in week 7.

==Personal life==
Dynevor married scriptwriter Tim Dynevor, at Bowdon Parish Church in Cheshire on 9 September 1995. They have three children, all of whom were born in Trafford, including daughters Phoebe and Hattie, who both appeared in the BBC drama series &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;.

In November 2009, Dynevor was diagnosed with breast cancer the same year her character was, for which she has had chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Dynevor returned to the ITV soap in July 2010 after a six-month break. Both the actor and character went on to make full recoveries.

Since 1999, Dynevor has been an ambassador for the charity ActionAid. She has travelled to India to raise awareness of the organisation and represented the charity on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.

<text>Photographic printing is the process of producing a final image on paper for viewing, using chemically sensitized paper. The paper is exposed to a photographic negative, a positive transparency (or &quot;slide&quot;), or a digital image file projected using an enlarger or digital exposure unit such as a LightJet or Minilab printer. Alternatively, the negative or transparency may be placed atop the paper and directly exposed, creating a contact print. Digital photographs are commonly printed on plain paper, for example by a color printer, but this is not considered &quot;photographic printing&quot;.

Following exposure, the paper is processed to reveal and make permanent the latent image.

== Printing on black-and-white paper ==

The process consists of four major steps, performed in a photographic darkroom or within an automated photo printing machine. These steps are:

*Exposure of the image onto the sensitized paper using a contact printer or enlarger;
*Processing of the latent image using the following chemical process:
**Development of the exposed image reduces the silver halide in the latent image to metallic silver;
**Stopping development by neutralising, diluting or removing the developing chemicals;
**Fixing the image by dissolving undeveloped silver halide from the light-sensitive emulsion:
**Washing thoroughly to remove processing chemicals protects the finished print from fading and deterioration.

Optionally, after fixing, the print is treated with a &quot;hypo clearing agent&quot; to ensure complete removal of the fixer, which would otherwise compromise the long term stability of the image. Prints can be chemically toned or hand coloured after processing.

===Panalure paper===
Kodak Panalure is a panchromatic black-and-white photographic printing paper. Panalure was developed to facilitate the printing of full-tone black-and-white images from colour negatives – a difficult task with conventional orthochromatic papers due to the orange tint of the film base. Panalure also finds application as paper negatives in large format cameras. It is generally not suitable for conventional black-and-white printing, since it must be handled and developed in near-complete darkness.

Kodak has announced that it will no longer produce or sell this product. However, , it is still available from various online retailers.

===Silver mirroring===
Silver mirroring, or &quot;silvering&quot;, is a degradation process of old black-and white-photographic prints caused by conversion of the black silver oxide to silver metal. This results in a slightly bluish, reflective patch in the darkest part of a print or negative when examined in raking light. It often indicates improper storage of the prints.

==Printing on coloured paper==
&quot;For more info see also: Chromogenic print&quot;

Colour papers require specific chemical processing in proprietary chemicals. Today&#x27;s processes are called RA-4, which is for printing colour negatives, and Ilfochrome, for colour transparencies.

===Printing from colour negatives===
*Colour negatives are printed on RA-4 papers and produce a Type C print. These are essentially the same as colour negative films in that they consist of three emulsion layers, each sensitive to red, green and blue light. Upon processing, colour couplers produce cyan, magenta and yellow dyes, representing the true colours of the subject. The processing sequence is very similar to the C-41 process.
*Rollei makes a film called &#x27;Digibase 200 Pro&#x27; that is like a conventional C-41 film but it has no orange mask, allowing easy prints on black-and-white paper with a grade 2 or 3 variable contrast filter

=== Printing from colour transparencies ===

*Ilfochrome paper uses the dye destruction process to produce prints from positive transparencies. The colour dyes are incorporated into the paper and bleached during processing. Ilfochrome, EP2 and Type R print papers and chemicals are no longer in production.

<text>The Liberal Republican Party was an American political party that was organized in May 1872 to oppose the reelection of President Ulysses S. Grant and his Radical Republican supporters in the presidential election of 1872. The party emerged in Missouri under the leadership of Senator Carl Schurz and soon attracted other opponents of Grant; Liberal Republicans decried the scandals of the Grant administration and sought civil service reform. The party opposed Grant&#x27;s Reconstruction policies, particularly the Enforcement Acts. It lost in a landslide, and disappeared from the national stage after the 1872 election.

The Republican Party had emerged as the dominant party in the aftermath of the Civil War, but many original Republicans became dissatisfied with the leadership of President Grant. Prominent liberal leaders like Schurz, Charles Sumner and Lyman Trumbull had been leaders in the fight against slavery and for the first stages of Reconstruction. They considered the task accomplished, and thought continued radical policies to be oppressive. By 1872, they demanded an end to Reconstruction and a restoration of self-government to the South.

The 1872 Liberal Republican convention nominated a ticket consisting of Horace Greeley, longtime publisher of the &quot;New-York Tribune,&quot; and Missouri Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown. Seeking to defeat Grant, the Democratic Party nominated the Liberal Republican ticket and endorsed the Liberal Republican platform. However, Grant emerged triumphant in the election, capitalizing on superior party organization. Democrats lacked enthusiasm for Greeley, who for decades had denounced them. Greeley received 44% of the popular vote, winning the states of Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Maryland. Grant received 286 of the 352 electoral college votes. Greeley died shortly after the election.

The Liberal Republican Party vanished immediately after the election, though a handful of its leaders continued to serve in Congress. Former party members scattered into the Democratic and Republican parties. By cutting the allegiance of liberal elements to the Republican Party, the Liberal Republicans made it possible for many of these leaders to move to the Democratic Party.

==History of the party==
===Formation===
Originally, liberal Republicans advocated for a return to traditional classical republicanism, were concerned about corruption and centralized power creeping into the federal government, and wanted to reform the Republican Party. As the liberal Republicans began to form a political party, a few years later, it was taken over by others who were anti-Grant and anti-reconstruction. The party began in Missouri in 1870 under the leadership of Carl Schurz and spread nationwide. It had strong support from powerful Republican newspaper editors such as Murat Halstead of the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial&quot;, Horace White of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Henry Watterson of the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot;, Samuel Bowles of the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; and especially Whitelaw Reid and Horace Greeley of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;. Many Liberal Republican leaders had been Democrats and members of the Free Soil Party before joining the Republican Party after its creation in the 1850s.

The Liberal Republicans thought that the Grant administration and the President personally were fully corrupt. More importantly, they thought that the goals of Reconstruction had been achieved. These goals were firstly the destruction of slavery, and secondly the destruction of Confederate nationalism. With these goals achieved the tenets of republicanism demanded that federal military troops be removed from the South, where they were propping up allegedly corrupt Republican regimes. Many of the original founders of the Republican party and leaders of the Civil War joined the movement, including its nominee Horace Greeley, Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, Cassius Marcellus Clay of Kentucky and Charles Francis Adams of Massachusetts. The party platform demanded &quot;the immediate and absolute removal of all disabilities imposed on account of the rebellion&quot; and local self-government for the southern states. It regarded &quot;a thorough reform of the civil service as one of the most pressing necessities of the hour&quot;. Many Liberal Republicans also sought a downward revision of the tariff, believing that powerful industries had unfairly won the protection of certain goods.

The Liberal Republicans argued that the goal of ensuring civil and political rights for African Americans had been achieved. Hence, they contended it was time for &quot;amnesty&quot;, which meant restoring to ex-Confederates the right to vote and hold office. A key motivation for many Liberal Republicans was a belief in states&#x27; rights and a fear of a strong federal government. Many Liberal Republicans had joined the Republican Party in the 1850s in opposition to the expansion of slavery into the territories, but with slavery no longer an issue and the Civil War over, other issues such as federal power re-emerged. Many of the Liberal Republicans, including Trumbull, had opposed the impeachment of Andrew Johnson and were wary of an upset of the traditional constitutional balance of power. According to historian Eric Foner, all four of the remaining Republican senators who voted to acquit President Johnson had joined the Liberal Republican Party in 1872.

===1872 convention===
Led by Schurz, judge Stanley Matthews and editor William Grosvenor, the Liberal Republican Party organized a national convention in Cincinnati in May 1872. In Missouri, Democrats and Liberal Republicans had successfully defeated the incumbent Republican governor and the Liberal Republicans hoped to nominate a presidential candidate who could likewise win the support of Democrats. Though Schurz had founded the party, he was ineligible to run for president as he had been born in Germany and instead became the chairman of the convention. Those who attended the convention had various motivations, though all were united in opposition to Grant. Many delegates were attracted to the party&#x27;s support for civil service reform and an end to Reconstruction. Others like Reuben Fenton hoped to recapture control of state party organizations. In Missouri, the Liberal Republicans had become established as a major party, but the other states lacked a party organization and their delegations were little more than self-appointed committees.

Entering the convention, Supreme Court Justice David Davis, Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois and former Congressman Charles Francis Adams of Massachusetts were among the major candidates for the presidential nomination. Schurz favored Adams, but was unwilling to publicly back a candidate as he wished to retain the appearance of impartiality. Davis entered the week of the convention with perhaps the strongest backing, but saw his candidacy damaged by unfavorable coverage from newspapers aligned with the Liberal Republican movement. Newspaper publisher Horace Greeley of New York won the support of many former Davis backers, despite some concern about his lack of support for tariff reduction.

On the first ballot of the convention, Adams and Greeley emerged as the two strongest contenders for the nomination. Most delegates voted for Adams or Greeley on subsequent ballots, though Trumbull retained significant support. On the sixth and final ballot, Greeley picked up just enough to clinch the nomination. Following the presidential nomination, the convention chose Missouri Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown as the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee. Brown had supported Greeley&#x27;s nomination as a way to increase his power within the state party at the expense of Schurz, and Brown won the support of most pro-Greeley delegates on the vice presidential ballot.

===1872 campaign===

Prior to the Liberal Republican convention, Democratic leaders had given the Liberal Republicans assurances that they would nominate the Liberal Republican ticket. The Democrats believed that they could not win the 1872 election without anti-Grant Republicans and Democratic leaders hoped that they would reap patronage rewards from a Liberal Republican presidency. However, Democratic leaders were dismayed by the nomination of Greeley. Many Southern Democrats were eager to elect any candidate that might put an end to Grant&#x27;s Reconstruction policies, but Greeley&#x27;s frequent attacks on the Democratic Party had earned the enmity of many Democrats, especially in the Northeast. Despite these qualms, most Democrats decided that Greeley was better than Grant and represented their only chance to defeat the Republican president. Though several state conventions endured considerable debate, every state Democratic convention other than Delaware&#x27;s convention ultimately endorsed Greeley. By a wide margin, the July 1872 Democratic National Convention voted to endorse the Liberal Republican ticket and accept the party&#x27;s platform without modification. After the convention, a group of disaffected Democrats led by Blanton Duncan nominated Charles O&#x27;Conor and John Quincy Adams II on the Straight-Out Democratic Party ticket, but both refused the nomination and neither actively campaigned.

The Liberal Republican Party fused with the Democratic Party in all states except for Louisiana and Texas. In states where Republicans were stronger, the Liberal Republicans fielded a majority of the joint slate of candidates for lower offices; while in states where Democrats were stronger, the Democrats fielded the most candidates. In many states, such as Ohio, each party nominated half of a joint slate of candidates. Even initially reluctant Democratic leaders like Thomas F. Bayard came to support Greeley.

The 1872 campaign was primarily conducted on personalities rather than issues, with Greeley and Grant both sustaining numerous personal attacks. Greeley favored protectionism and did not emphasize civil service reform, two of the motivating issues for the party&#x27;s founders. Greeley attacked many of Grant&#x27;s many appointments as corrupt, but Greeley&#x27;s past associations with Republican leaders undermined the corruption argument. Nonetheless, Liberal Republican leaders like Schurz and Sumner coalesced behind Greeley and most actively campaigned for the party&#x27;s nominee. Grant&#x27;s backers accused the Liberal Republicans of seeking to overturn the results of the Civil War and the Republicans mobilized veteran&#x27;s organizations in support of Grant. Liberal Republicans argued that they sought reconciliation of North and South and that the time had come to end radical Reconstruction policies. Each party sought to appeal to African Americans, with the Liberal Republican appeal centering on Greeley&#x27;s long history of abolitionism. However, Frederick Douglass successfully organized blacks in support of Grant. Many inside and outside of the Liberal Republican Party believed that their coalition would triumph in the 1872 election and the outcome of the election remained in doubt until October. However, the Republicans utilized superior organization, the backing of financiers like Jay Cooke and lingering Democratic doubts about Greeley to win most contests throughout the country.

Foner writes that in spite of Greeley&#x27;s personal record of advocating civil rights, blacks held a sharp distrust due to his association in the election cycle with the Democratic Party, and furthermore recognized that civil service reform would inhibit their social and economic progress by effectively barring &quot;the whole colored population&quot; from public office.

In the election, Greeley won 43.8% of the popular vote and just 66 of the 352 electoral votes, while O&#x27;Conor won 0.3% of the popular vote. Greeley died on November 29, 1872, before the presidential electors met on December 4 to cast the electoral votes. The Greeley electors were not able to coordinate their votes before meeting, but their action made no difference in the face of Grant&#x27;s electoral college landslide.

===Aftermath===
Although the Liberal Republican Party did not survive Greeley&#x27;s death, several of its reforms materialized in the following decade. Reform Republicans accomplished the nomination and then election of Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, who brought Reconstruction to an end and removed some of Grant&#x27;s appointments. The Liberal Republican call for civil service reform was passed during the administration of President Chester Arthur. However, Greeley&#x27;s relatively poor performance (he fared worse than Horatio Seymour had in 1868) also put an end to the Democratic experiment with fusion tickets.

Though the national party organization disappeared, several Liberal Republican members continued to serve in Congress after the 1872 elections. While those in the House were allowed to keep their committee assignments and chairmanships, Liberal Republican Senators became de facto independents and received inferior committee assignments. Most Liberal Republican Congressmen eventually joined the Democratic Party. Outside of the South, some Liberal Republicans sought the creation of a new party opposed to Republicans, but Democrats were unwilling to abandon their old party affiliation and even relatively successful efforts like Wisconsin&#x27;s Reform Party collapsed. Even the Missouri Liberal Republican Party collapsed as the Democrats became the major opposition party to the Republicans.

Democrats won several seats in Congress and numerous other offices in the 1874 elections, aided by dissatisfaction with Grant and the defection of former Liberal Republicans. As Republicans became increasingly worried about their chances in the 1876 elections, they courted former Liberal Republican leaders like Schurz and Fenton. Both parties made direct appeals to former Liberal Republicans in the 1876 elections and former party supporters split roughly evenly between the two presidential candidates. Schurz actively campaigned for Hayes and became the Secretary of Interior after Hayes won the election. In the following years, former Liberal Republicans became members in good standing of both major parties. In the 1880s, many would join the Mugwump movement in opposition to James G. Blaine. Many also joined the Greenback Party, which sought inflationary policies and labor reforms.

==Interpretations==

Historian Richard Gerber argues that most authors and historians portray the Liberal Republicans as an aberration, noting the many unresolved issues of the Reconstruction Era. He groups the historical interpretations of the party that prevailed after 1872 into two main categories. One historical interpretation emphasizes the Liberal Republican push for the re-establishment of self-government in the South and the restoration of national unity. The second interpretation sees the Liberal Republicans as primarily motivated by opposition to the corruption of the Grant administration and support for lower tariffs.

Downey argues Greeley was nominated as a result of a crass political bargain imposed against the will of a convention that really wanted Charles Francis Adams. Men like Schurz supported Adams, but were inexperienced political idealists and not professional politicians. They neither acted nor voted as a bloc, particularly after the collapse of a boom for David Davis, a collapse engineered by a group of leading reformist Republican editors. The shift of particular votes to Greeley was not decisive, but the feeling of the delegates that Adams could not win support among Irish workers, the Western masses, or Democratic voters.

Lunde argues Grant supporters hailed the Civil War as a great triumph which had bound the United States into a united nation, linked not only by sentiment but by rapidly increasing networks of railroads. The Democrats and their Liberal Republican allies thought the war was a tragedy, recoiled against centralization and sought to recapture the purity of prewar days through reconciliation and respect for the autonomy of the states. Greeley&#x27;s benevolent image of nationalism was defeated by the centralizing, &quot;blood and iron&quot; concept of Grant.

McPherson argues that three-quarters of ex abolitionists favored Grant, although such antislavery Republicans as Charles Francis Adams, Carl Schurz and Charles Sumner were key supporters of Greeley. Focused on the welfare of the freedmen, abolitionists were appalled by Greeley&#x27;s formula for cooperation with &quot;better class&quot; southern whites by granting amnesty to all Confederates and adopting a hands-off policy toward the South. They supported Grant in the belief that his Southern policy promised the best protection for the African Americans. Most abolitionists believed that, moral suasion having failed earlier, true equality could be achieved only through relentless law enforcement.

Slap (2006) defends the reputation of the Liberal Republicans from allegations of opportunism (as presented by Ari Hoogenboom), of elitism (as presented by John G. Sproat) and racism as presented by the neoabolitionists. He joins Heather Cox Richardson and David Quigley in concluding that Reconstruction ended not because of politicized violence in the South, but because of the Northern decision that the war goals had been achieved and it would thwart republican ideals to continue Army rule of the South.

<text>In mathematics, the Newton polygon is a tool for understanding the behaviour of polynomials over local fields, or more generally, over ultrametric fields. 
In the original case, the ultrametric field of interest was &quot;essentially&quot; the field of formal Laurent series in the indeterminate &quot;X&quot;, i.e. the field of fractions of the formal power series ring formula_1,
over formula_2, where formula_2 was the real number or complex number field. This is still of considerable utility with respect to Puiseux expansions. The Newton polygon is an effective device for understanding the leading terms formula_4
of the power series expansion solutions to equations formula_5
where formula_6 is a polynomial with coefficients in formula_7, the polynomial ring; that is, implicitly defined algebraic functions. The exponents formula_8 here are certain rational numbers, depending on the branch chosen; and the solutions themselves are power series in formula_9
with formula_10 for a denominator formula_11 corresponding to the branch. The Newton polygon gives an effective, algorithmic approach to calculating formula_11.

After the introduction of the p-adic numbers, it was shown that the Newton polygon is just as useful in questions of ramification for local fields, and hence in algebraic number theory. Newton polygons have also been useful in the study of elliptic curves.

==Definition==

A priori, given a polynomial over a field, the behaviour of the roots (assuming it has roots) will be unknown. Newton polygons provide one technique for the study of the behaviour of the roots.

Let formula_2 be a field endowed with a non-archimedean valuation formula_14, and let

:formula_15
with formula_16. Then the Newton polygon of formula_17 is defined to be the lower boundary of the convex hull of the set of points formula_18 
ignoring the points with formula_19.

Restated geometrically, plot all of these points &quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot; on the &quot;xy&quot;-plane. Let&#x27;s assume that the points indices increase from left to right (&quot;P&quot;&quot;0&quot; is the leftmost point, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the rightmost point). Then, starting at &quot;P&quot;0, draw a ray straight down parallel with the &quot;y&quot;-axis, and rotate this ray counter-clockwise until it hits the point &quot;P&quot;k1 (not necessarily &quot;P&quot;1). Break the ray here. Now draw a second ray from &quot;P&quot;k1 straight down parallel with the &quot;y&quot;-axis, and rotate this ray counter-clockwise until it hits the point &quot;P&quot;k2. Continue until the process reaches the point &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;; the resulting polygon (containing the points &quot;P&quot;0, &quot;P&quot;k1, &quot;P&quot;k2, ..., &quot;P&quot;km, &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is the Newton polygon.

Another, perhaps more intuitive way to view this process is this : consider a rubber band surrounding all the points &quot;P&quot;0, ..., &quot;P&quot;n. Stretch the band upwards, such that the band is stuck on its lower side by some of the points (the points act like nails, partially hammered into the xy plane). The vertices of the Newton polygon are exactly those points.

For a neat diagram of this see Ch6 §3 of &quot;Local Fields&quot; by JWS Cassels, LMS Student Texts 3, CUP 1986. It is on p99 of the 1986 paperback edition.

== Main theorem ==
With the notations in the previous section, the main result concerning the Newton polygon is the following theorem, which states that the valuation of the roots of formula_17 are entirely determined by its Newton polygon:

Let formula_21
be the slopes of the line segments of the Newton polygon of formula_22 (as defined above) arranged in increasing order, and let
formula_23
be the corresponding lengths of the line segments projected onto the x-axis (i.e. if we have a line segment stretching between the points formula_24 and formula_25 then the length is formula_26).

* The formula_27 are distinct;
* formula_28;
* if formula_29 is a root of formula_17 in formula_2, formula_32;
* for every formula_33, the number of roots of formula_17 whose valuations are equal to formula_35 (counting multiplicities) is at most formula_36, with equality if formula_17 splits into the product of linear factors over formula_2.

== Corollaries and applications ==

With the notation of the previous sections, we denote, in what follows, by formula_39 the splitting field of formula_17 over formula_2, and by formula_42 an extension of formula_43 to formula_39.

Newton polygon theorem is often used to show the irreducibility of polynomials, as in the next corollary for example:
* &quot;Suppose that the valuation formula_45 is discrete and normalized, and that the Newton polynomial of formula_17 contains only one segment whose slope is formula_47 and projection on the x-axis is formula_48. If formula_49, with formula_50 coprime to formula_51, then formula_17 is irreducible over formula_2. In particular, since the Newton polygon of an Eisenstein polynomial consists of a single segment of slope formula_54 connecting formula_55 and formula_56, Eisenstein criterion follows.&quot;
Indeed, by the main theorem, if formula_29 is a root of formula_17, formula_59 
If formula_17 were not irreducible over formula_2, then the degree formula_11 of formula_29 would be formula_64, and there would hold formula_65. But this is impossible since formula_66 with formula_50 coprime .

Another simple corollary is the following:

* &quot;Assume that formula_68 is Henselian. If the Newton polygon of formula_17 fulfills formula_70 for some formula_33, then formula_17 has a root in formula_2.&quot;

&quot;Proof:&quot; By the main theorem, formula_17 must have a single root formula_29 whose valuation is formula_76 In particular, formula_29 is separable over formula_2. 
If formula_29 does not belong to formula_2, formula_29 has a distinct Galois conjugate formula_82 over formula_2, with formula_84, and formula_82 is a root of formula_17, a contradiction.

More generally, the following factorization theorem holds:

* &quot;Assume that formula_68 is Henselian. Then formula_88, where formula_89, formula_90 is monic for every formula_33, the roots of formula_92 are of valuation formula_93, and formula_94.&quot; 
:&quot;Moreover, formula_95, and if formula_96 is coprime to formula_36, formula_92 is irreducible over formula_2.&quot; 

&quot;Proof:&quot;
For every formula_33, denote by formula_92 the product of the monomials formula_102 such that formula_29 is a root of formula_17 and formula_105. We also denote formula_106 the factorization of formula_107 in formula_7 into prime monic factors formula_109
Let formula_29 be a root of formula_92. We can assume that formula_112 is the minimal polynomial of formula_29 over formula_2. 
If formula_82 is a root of formula_112, there exists a K-automorphism formula_117 of formula_39 that sends formula_29 to formula_82, and we have formula_121 since formula_2 is Henselian. Therefore formula_82 is also a root of formula_92.
Moreover, every root of formula_112 of multiplicity formula_126 is clearly a root of formula_127 of multiplicity formula_128, since repeated roots share obviously the same valuation. This shows that formula_129 divides formula_130
Let formula_131. Choose a root formula_132 of formula_133. Notice that the roots of formula_133 are distinct from the roots of formula_112. Repeat the previous argument with the minimal polynomial of formula_136 over formula_2, assumed w.l.g. to be formula_138, to show that formula_139 divides formula_140. 
Continuing this process until all the roots of formula_92 are exhausted, one eventually arrives to 
formula_142, with formula_143. This shows that formula_90, formula_92 monic. 
But the formula_92 are coprime since their roots have distinct valuations. Hence clearly formula_147, showing the main contention.
The fact that formula_148 follows from the main theorem, and so does the fact that formula_95, by remarking that the Newton polygon of formula_92 can have only one segment joining formula_151 to formula_152. The condition for the irreducibility of formula_92 follows from the corollary above. (q.e.d.) 

The following is an immediate corollary of the factorization above, and constitutes a test for the reducibility of polynomials over Henselian fields:

* &quot;Assume that formula_68 is Henselian. If the Newton polygon does not reduce to a single segment formula_155 then formula_17 is reducible over formula_2.&quot; 
Other applications of the Newton polygon comes from the fact that a Newton Polygon is sometimes a special case of a Newton polytope, and can be used to construct asymptotic solutions of two-variable polynomial equations like 
formula_158

==Symmetric function explanation==
In the context of a valuation, we are given certain information in the form of the valuations of elementary symmetric functions of the roots of a polynomial, and require information on the valuations of the actual roots, in an algebraic closure. This has aspects both of ramification theory and singularity theory. The valid inferences possible are to the valuations of power sums, by means of Newton&#x27;s identities.

== History==
Newton polygons are named after Isaac Newton, who first described them and some of their uses in correspondence from the year 1676 addressed to Henry Oldenburg.

<text>G&amp;L is an American guitar manufacturing company founded by Leo Fender, George Fullerton, and Dale Hyatt in the late 1970s. G&amp;L produces electric guitars and basses with designs based on some classic Fender instruments. The company also produces effects units. G&amp;L&#x27;s most notable player is Jerry Cantrell, vocalist and guitarist of Alice in Chains, having played several models of the guitar since the &#x27;80s, Cantrell also has his own signature Tribute Series Rampage and Superhawk. Cantrell can be seen playing a single-humbucker G&amp;L Rampage in the music video for Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Man In The Box&quot;.

==Founding==
Leo Fender sold his eponymous company Fender in 1965. He designed and produced instruments for Music Man in the 1970s through his company CLF Research. When relations with Music Man soured, G&amp;L was created to continue operations apart from Music Man. The G&amp;L name comes from two founders&#x27; first names, George Fullerton and Leo Fender.

G&amp;L instruments are similar to the classic Fenders, but with some Leo Fender modern innovations. They are built at the same facility on Fender Avenue in Fullerton, California that produced the early Music Man instruments. G&amp;L instruments are not widely distributed but are highly regarded by many musicians and collectors. The relatively small scale of production further allows for more custom options that are not possible on larger production lines.

After the death of Leo Fender in 1991, Fender&#x27;s wife, Phyllis Fender, passed the management of G&amp;L to John C. McLaren of BBE Sound. George Fullerton remained a permanent consultant until his death on July 4, 2009, and Leo&#x27;s wife Phyllis remained as Honorary Chairperson of G&amp;L until her death in July 2020.

In a print advertisement for G&amp;L, Leo Fender claimed the G&amp;L line of instruments were &quot;the best instruments I have ever made.&quot;

==Innovations==

Leo Fender and George Fullerton created improved designs over the years, with the most advanced being featured in G&amp;L instruments.:
* The &quot;Magnetic Field Design&quot; (MFD) pickups use a ceramic bar magnet in combination with soft iron pole pieces with adjustable height, instead of the traditional Alnico magnet, and allow a player to set the pickup output per string, as opposed to the entire pickup as a whole in traditional single-coil pickup designs. MFDs are known for their distinctive tone, which combines clarity, high fidelity and power with an airy &quot;sweetness&quot;.
* The &quot;Dual-Fulcrum Vibrato&quot; has two pivot points. The design aims to improve tuning stability, and according to some has a sound that is more mellow than a traditional bridge. It allows the player to bend notes up as well as down. See also Tremolo arm.
* The G&amp;L &quot;Saddle-Lock bridge&quot; utilizes a small Allen screw on the side of the bridge, to reduce side-to-side movement of the individual string saddles. The design, and the bridge&#x27;s beefy dimensions, aim to prevent loss of sustain due to this sideways motion by locking the saddles together.
* The &quot;Tilt Neck Mechanism&quot; designed and patented by George Fullerton. This feature is no longer used, and was a carryover from Music Man production.
* The &quot;Bi-cut neck design&quot; involved cutting the neck lengthwise perpendicular to where the fretboard is later installed, routing a channel for the truss rod, then gluing the two neck pieces back together. As G&amp;L moved production to CNC machines, this method was phased out.

== Models == 
In 2003, G&amp;L introduced the Tribute series to the US market as a more affordable alternative to the USA built products. Tribute G&amp;L&#x27;s were made in Korea by Cort Guitars using USA hardware, and electronics in many of the guitars. Some non-original parts were also used on value-based models, such as those sold exclusively through Guitar Center. The pickups used are all originally made by G&amp;L in Fullerton, California. Production of the guitars has since moved to a Cort facility in Indonesia.

Before 2003, Tribute guitars were briefly produced in Japan for non-US markets, shifting to South Korea.

The Tribute series is offered in many of the same body shapes as their original creations although some use hardware and pickups designed by G&amp;L but sourced in Asia. The Tribute SB-2 was offered briefly but was discontinued, however, it was reintroduced late 2006/early 2007. The JB-2 was introduced to the Tribute series at the same time.

As of 2020, the Tribute line contains many of the standard guitars from G&amp;L including the Commanche, S-500, Legacy, various ASAT models, Doheny and others.

<text>Kristina Wagner (born Kristina Kay Crump; October 30, 1962) is an American actress. She is sometimes credited by the name Kristina Malandro. She is best known for her role as Felicia Jones on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She also briefly had a small role on the ABC series &quot;Hotel&quot; in the late 1980s.

== Career ==
On September 7, 1984, Kristina Wagner got her big break when she was cast as Felicia Cummings on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as the spirited Aztec princess. She became half of the 80&#x27;s super couple Frisco and Felicia, whose on-screen chemistry was real and undeniable. She appeared in the role on a contract basis until 2003. After a brief departure, she returned to the series in a recurring capacity in 2004. In May 2005, however, Wagner asked ABC to place her back on contract status for an important storyline involving her character. After ABC refused, Wagner walked, and she was replaced briefly by former &quot;Another World&quot; actress Sandra Ferguson. Upon Ferguson&#x27;s departure in 2005, the character was absent from the show until late 2007, when Wagner again returned for a month-long stint.

In 2012, it was announced that Wagner would once again reprise the role of Felicia, with a first airing on April 27 that year.

In 2013, it was announced that Wagner was releasing a documentary, &quot;Children of Internment&quot;, which she produced and directed with her brother, Joe Crump. The documentary concerns the events surrounding the American internment of German-Americans during World War II. The documentary won Best Documentary at the Santa Fe Film Festival.

Wagner appeared as Nora Avery alongside her ex-husband, actor Jack Wagner, on the Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot;.

At age 54, Wagner posed in a bikini for the first time ever for the cover of &quot;First for Women&quot;.

In 2019, Wagner celebrated her 35-year journey with &quot;General Hospital&quot;, recounting how the journey affected both her professional and personal life.

In late 2021, Wagner was placed back under contract at General Hospital after 18 years downgraded to recurring.

== Personal life ==
Wagner is a native of Indianapolis, Indiana.

After privately dating, Kristina Wagner went public about her relationship with her &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star, Jack Wagner, when she announced her pregnancy in 1990. Kristina and Jack Wagner eventually wed on December 18, 1993, in a private ceremony in Lake Tahoe. Citing irreconcilable differences, they filed for divorce in February 2001. After two years apart, the Wagners announced that they were working through their problems and privately reconciling; they publicized their news of formal reconciliation in 2004. However, in 2005, the Wagners once again filed for divorce, which was finalized the following year. The couple had two sons born in 1990 and 1994. Their younger son died in Los Angeles on June 6, 2022. On June 13, 2022, Wagner and former husband Jack announced that their younger son died of drug addiction. The couple have since created a scholarship fund in honour of their son. All funds donated to the Harrison Wagner Scholarship Fund will be used to directly help young men pay their rent or a portion of their rent who could not otherwise afford their care at New Life House (a sober living facility in California).

After her divorce, she decided to go back to college and attended California State University, Northridge where she majored in history. In her senior year, she began working on what became the &quot;Children of Internment&quot; documentary.

A self-proclaimed adventurous type, Wagner loves camping, river rafting and mountaineering, as well as ice skating, swimming and gymnastics.

<doc id="742498" wikidata="Q17514858" url="?curid=742498" title="Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale">
<text>Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was held by junior members of the British royal family. It was named after the county of Cumberland in England, and after Teviotdale in Scotland. Held by the Hanoverian royals, it was suspended under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, which revoked titles belonging to enemies of the United Kingdom during the Great War.

==History==

The title Duke of Cumberland had been created three times in the Peerages of England and Great Britain.

In 1799, the double dukedom of Cumberland and Teviotdale, in the Peerage of Great Britain, was bestowed on Ernest Augustus (later King of Hanover), fifth son of King George III of the United Kingdom. Cumberland is a historic county in northwest England, while Teviotdale refers to the basin of the River Teviot in Scotland. In 1837, Ernest became king of Hanover, and on his death in 1851 the title descended with the kingdom to his son King George V of Hanover, and on George&#x27;s death in 1878 to his grandson Prince Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover. In 1866, Hanover was annexed by Prussia, but King George died without renouncing his rights. His son Ernest, while maintaining his claim to the kingdom of Hanover, was generally known by his title of Duke of Cumberland in Britain.

The title was suspended for Ernest&#x27;s pro-German activities during World War I under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, as it was for his son. Under the Act, the lineal male heirs of the 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale have the right to petition the British Crown for the restoration of his peerages. To date, none has done so. The present heir is Prince Ernst August of Hanover (born 26 February 1954), great grandson of the 3rd Duke and current head of the House of Hanover. He is the senior male-line descendant of George III of the United Kingdom.

==Dukes of Cumberland and Teviotdale==
After the Union of Great Britain, the Hanoverian kings liked to grant double titles (one from one constituent country, one from another) to emphasise unity.

<text>Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was conferred upon a member of the British royal family. It was named after the county of Cumberland in England, and after Strathearn in Scotland.

==History==
The title of Duke of Cumberland had been created three times in the Peerages of England and Great Britain.

The title of Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn was created on 22 October 1766 in the Peerage of Great Britain. This double dukedom and the Earldom of Dublin in the Peerage of Ireland were bestowed on Prince Henry, the third son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and grandson of King George II. Since Prince Henry died without legitimate children, the title became extinct.

The title of Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale was later created in the Peerage of Great Britain.

Cumberland is a historic county of England, while the title Strathearn referred to the strath (valley) of the River Earn in Scotland; the ancient title Earl/Mormaer of Strathearn died out in the 15th century.

<doc id="742515" wikidata="Q430032" url="?curid=742515" title="Pan-Islamism">
<text>Pan-Islamism () is a political movement which advocates the unity of Muslims under one Islamic country or state – often a caliphate – or an international organization with Islamic principles. Historically, after Ottomanism, which aimed at the unity of all Ottoman citizens, Pan-Islamism was promoted in the Ottoman Empire during the last quarter of the 19th century by Sultan Abdul Hamid II for the purpose of preventing secession movements of the Muslim peoples in the empire.

Pan-Islamism differentiates itself from pan-nationalistic ideologies, for example Pan-Arabism, by seeing the ummah (Muslim community) as the focus of allegiance and mobilization, including the Tawhid belief by the guidance of Quran and Sunnah&#x27;s teachings, excluding ethnicity and race as its primary unifying factors.

The major leaders of the Pan-Islamist movement were the triad of Jamal al-Din Afghani (1839–1897), Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905) and Sayyid Rashid Rida (1865–1935), who were active in anti-colonial efforts to confront European penetration of Muslim lands. They also sought to strengthen Islamic unity, which they believed to be the strongest force to mobilize Muslims against imperial domination. Following Ibn Saud&#x27;s conquest of the Arabian Peninsula, pan-Islamism would be bolstered across the Islamic world. During the second half of the 20th century, pan-Islamists competed against left-wing nationalist ideologies in the Arab world such as Nasserism and Ba&#x27;athism. At the height of the Cold War in the 1960s and 1970s, Saudi Arabia and allied countries in the Muslim world led the Pan-Islamist struggle to fight the spread of communist ideology and curtail the rising Soviet influence in the world.

== Classical doctrines ==

The Arabic term Ummah, which is found in the Quran and Islamic tradition, has historically been used to denote the Muslims as a whole, regardless of race, ethnicity, etc. This term has been used in a political sense by classical Islamic scholars e.g. such as al-Mawardi in Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah, where he discusses the contract of Imamate of the Ummah, &quot;prescribed to succeed Prophethood&quot; in protection of the religion and of managing the affairs of the world. Al-Ghazali also talks about Ummah in a political sense e.g. in his work, &quot;Fadiah al-Batinyah wa Fadail al-Mustazhariyah&quot;.

Fakhruddin al-Razi, who also talks about Ummah in a political sense, is quoted as saying the following:
According to some scholars, the ideology&#x27;s aims takes early years of Islam – the reign of Muhammad and the early caliphate – especially during Islamic golden age as its model, as it is commonly held that during these years the Muslim world was strong, unified, and free from corruption.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Many scholars assert that the doctrines of pan-Islamism could be observed as early as during the era of Islamic Iberia, Emirate of Sicily, the Gunpowder Empires (Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal Empires) and several Muslim sultanates and kingdoms, despite the presence and employment of non-Muslim subjects by Muslim powers. During the 18th century, multiple movements for puritanical Islamic renewal would emerge. Amongst these, the revivalist movements of three leading religious reformers – Shah Wali Allah of Delhi (1702–1763), the Arabian Muhammad Ibn &#x27;Abd al-Wahhab (1703–1792), and the Nigerian Uthman dan Fodio (1755–1816) – are widely regarded as the precursors of the modern-era Pan-Islamist thought. Despite their calls for puritanical reform, these movements were not politically concerned with the international situation of the Muslim world, and had not elaborated comprehensive pan-Islamist programmes to combat the Western threat. Since they did not call for the revival of an international Islamic entity, their ideas and impact were limited to the local regional contexts of West Africa, Arabia, and South Asia.

In spite of their diversity, these 18th century Muslim reformers were united in their condemnation of declining morality and calls for the revival of scripture-based piety. Inspired by these movements, Islamic reformers at the turn of the 19th century adopted novel strategies for overcoming the crisis faced by the Muslim world by adapting to the fast-paced transformation of its era. Their proposed approaches now oscillated between an open admiration for the technology-mediated Western ideology of societal progress and a clear rejection of it on the grounds of the axiomatic superiority of an idealized Islamic culture, rooted in Scripturalist injunctions. Two major scholars of early colonial Egypt &#x27;Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti (d. 1825) and Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi (d. 1872) represented these intellectual trends. While Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi exemplified the former, &#x27;Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti represented the latter, Scriptural-oriented approach.

=== Modern era ===

==== Late 19th century ====

In the modern era, Pan-Islamism was championed by Jamal al-Din al-Afghani who sought unity among Muslims to resist colonial occupation of Muslim lands. Afghani feared that nationalism would divide the Muslim world and believed that Muslim unity was more important than ethnic identity. Although sometimes described as &quot;liberal&quot;, al-Afghani did not advocate constitutional government but simply envisioned &quot;the overthrow of individual rulers who were lax or subservient to foreigners, and their replacement by strong and patriotic men.&quot; In a review of the theoretical articles of his Paris-based newspaper there was nothing &quot;favoring political democracy or parliamentarianism,&quot; according to his biographer.

While Afghani was an advocate of revolution from above, his student &#x27;Abduh believed in revolution from below, through religious and educational reforms. Despite al-Afghani&#x27;s tremendous influence on &#x27;Abduh, the latter eventually would distance himself from Afghani&#x27;s political path. He instead focused on gradual efforts in the field of education, which he viewed as more effective instruments for reform. He criticised Afghani and pan-Islamist intellectuals for their political activities. Afghani had bitter arguments with Abduh and regularly accused him of timidity and dispiritedness.

==== Early 20th century ====

Islamic jurist Muhammad Rashid Rida – a student of Abduh and Afghani – on the other hand, was an avowed anti-imperialist and an exponent of a puritanical revolution, inspired by his nostalgia for the early eras of Islam. According to Rida, the state-sponsored scholars neglected the revival of early Islamic traditions in the Muslim &quot;Ummah&quot;. He believed that the unification of the Islamic community would only be possible through the restoration of an Islamic caliphate which implements the &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic law). His influential Islamic journal &quot;Al-Manar&quot; promoted anti-British revolt, as well as Islamic revivalism based on the tenets of &quot;Salafiyya&quot;. Positioning himself as the successor to the pan-Islamist activism of Afghani and &#x27;Abduh; Rida called for a pan-Islamic project based on revival of the Islamic caliphate led by Arabs and the reformation of Muslims. During the 1920s, Rida formulated the comprehensive Islamic state doctrine in his famous treatise &quot;al-Khilafa aw al-Imama al-&#x27;Uzma&quot; (&quot;The Caliphate or the Exalted Imamate&quot;) in which he called upon Muslims to strive to build a political system based on faith; rather than nationalism. He opposed the rising embracal of Western ideas amongst Muslims, arguing that only a return to Islam would restore the rightful position of Muslims in the modern age. Pan-Islamic networks, led by Rashid Rida and his associates, played a central role in later development of Islamist movements.

Rida&#x27;s Salafiyya movement advocated for pan-Islamist solidarity which involved socio-political campaigning to establish &quot;Sharia&quot; (Islamic laws). Following World War I, Rida and his disciples became the biggest adversaries of secularists and nationalists; and vehemently attacked all forms of democratic ideas. Articulating his Pan-Islamist vision, Rashid Rida wrote in &quot;Al-Manar&quot; in 1902:&quot;In sum, what I mean by Islamic unity is that the leaders (&quot;ahl al-Hal wal-&#x27;aqd&quot;) among the scholars and notables should meet and compile a book of ordinances which is based on the deeply-rooted fundamentals of the Divine Law, agrees with the needs of the time, is easy to use, and is free of disagreement (&quot;khilaf&quot;). The Supreme Imam then orders the rulers of Muslims to apply it (&quot;al-&#x27;amal bihi&quot;)&quot;In order to judge the rising importance of the Pan-Islamist movement during these years, Lothrop Stoddard in his 1921 book &quot;The New World of Islam&quot; looked at the growth in the Pan-Islamic press, writing that &quot;in 1900 there were in the whole Islamic world not more than 200 propagandist journals&quot;, as he puts it, but &quot;by 1906 there were 500, while in 1914 there were well over 1000.&quot;

==== Post-Ottoman era ====
After the Abolition of Caliphate in 1924, Pan-Islamism mobilized Muslim masses of both traditionalist and reform movements in Islam, inspired by the ideas of Rashid Rida. The Reformist movements led by Rida, would become more fundamentalist and literalist; emphasizing adherence to the idealised era of the &quot;Salaf&quot; and attempt to revive lost traditions. Rashid Rida&#x27;s socio-political views symbolised the convergence of the doctrines of the reformist, Salafist and pan-Islamist movements. During the 1920s, Rida and his Salafi disciples established the Young Men&#x27;s Muslim Association (YMMA); an influential Islamist youth organisation that spearheaded attacks against liberal trends and Western culture. This provided favourable conditions for the growth of various Islamist revolutionary movements.

The evolution of the early Pan-Islamist movement in the post-colonial world was strongly associated with Islamism. Leading Islamists such as Sayyid Qutb, Abul Ala Maududi, and Ayatollah Khomeini all stressed their belief that a return to traditional Sharia law would make Islam united and strong again. Extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the Kharijites. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to Takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.

In the period of de-colonialism following World War II, Arab nationalism overshadowed Islamism which denounced nationalism as un-Islamic. In the Arab world secular pan-Arab parties – Baath and Nasserist parties – had offshoots in almost every Arab country, and took power in Egypt, Libya, Iraq and Syria. Islamists suffered severe repression; its major thinker Sayyid Qutb, was imprisoned, underwent torture and was later executed. Egyptian president Nasser considered the idea of Muslim unity as a threat to Arab nationalism. 

In the 1950s, Pakistan&#x27;s government championed Muslim cooperation like many other Muslim countries however Pakistan&#x27;s efforts were complicated with its involvement in Baghdad pact and pro-western foreign diplomacy in light of the Palestine-Israel conflict, however later relations would be much better. Many Muslim countries suspected that Pakistan was aspiring to leadership of the Muslim world to in foreword help western powers in relations with other Muslim states.

==== Six-Day War ====
Following the defeat of Arab armies in the Six-Day War, Islamism and Pan-Islam began to reverse their relative position of popularity with nationalism and pan-Arabism. Political events in the Muslim world in the late 1960s convinced many Muslim states to shift their earlier ideas and respond favourably to Pakistan&#x27;s goal of Muslim unity. Nasser abandoned his opposition to a pan-Islamic platform and such developments facilitated the first summit conference of Muslim heads of state in Rabat in 1969. This conference was eventually transformed into a permanent body called Organisation of Islamic Conference.

==== Post 1979: Iranian Revolution and Afghan jihad ====
In 1979 the Iranian Revolution ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from power. Ten years later in 1989; the Afghan mujahideen, with major support from the United States, would successfully force the Soviet Union from Afghanistan. Pan-Islamic Sunni Muslims such as Maududi and the Muslim Brotherhood, embraced the creation of a new caliphate, at least as a long-term project. Shia leader Ruhollah Khomeini also embraced a united Islamic supra-state but saw it led by a (Shia) religious scholar of fiqh (a faqih).

These events galvanised Islamists the world over and heightened their popularity with the Muslim public. Throughout the Middle-East, and in particular Egypt, the various branches of the Muslim Brotherhood have significantly challenged the secular nationalist or monarchical Muslim governments. In Pakistan the Jamaat-e-Islami enjoyed popular support especially since the formation of the MMA, and in Algeria the FIS was expected to win the cancelled elections in 1992. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Hizb-ut-Tahrir has emerged as a Pan-Islamist force in Central Asia and in the last five years has developed some support from the Arab world.

A recent advocate for Pan-Islamism was late Turkish prime minister and founder of Millî Görüş movement Necmettin Erbakan, who championed the Pan-Islamic Union (İslam Birliği) idea and took steps in his government toward that goal by establishing the Developing 8 Countries (or D8, as opposed to G8) in 1996 with Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Bangladesh. His vision was gradual unity of Muslim nations through economic and technologic collaboration similar to the EU with a single monetary unit (İslam Dinarı), joint aerospace and defense projects, petrochemical technology development, regional civil aviation network and a gradual agreement to democratic values. Although the organization met at presidential and cabinet levels and moderate collaboration projects continue to date, the momentum was instantly lost when the so-called Post-Modern Coup of February 28, 1997, eventually took down Erbakan&#x27;s government.

<text>The Initiative for Software Choice (ISC) is a lobby group founded in May 2002 in response to widespread international government interest in open source software. The ISC website characterizes its membership as &quot;committed to advancing the concept that multiple competing software markets should be allowed to develop and flourish unimpeded by government preference or mandate&quot;.

According to many Free Software advocates such as Bruce Perens, Microsoft founded ISC in reaction to the call for the adoption of Free Software by politicians in many countries.

The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) chairs the Initiative.

<text>DataFlex is an object-oriented high-level programming language and a fourth generation visual tool for developing Windows, web and mobile software applications on one framework-based platform. It was introduced and developed by &quot;Data Access Corporation&quot; beginning in 1982.

==History and overview==
DataFlex can be traced back to 1982 when the company called &quot;Data Access Corporation&quot; (founded in 1976) created and developed a language allowing application code to run on almost any system architecture, regardless of hardware. It started as a relatively early example of a fully fledged and commercially used fourth-generation programming language (4GL). In its early forms, DataFlex was available for CP/M, MS-DOS, TurboDOS, Novell NetWare, OS/2, Unix, VMS and IBM AIX operating systems. By 1985, DataFlex was applied in a variety of high-tech industries including automated inventory control systems and insurance fraud detection systems.

DataFlex has lasted many years as a niche application development environment. The DataFlex product supports many relational database environments: Oracle database, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM Db2, MySQL, PostgreSQL and any ODBC database. DataFlex applications are used by around 3 million users. In 1991, the 3.0 version with a modernized interface was released. In 2014, Data Access released 2014/18.0 version. The release of DataFlex 2023/23.0 introduced FlexTron technology that allows the usage of web controls within Windows desktop applications.

DataFlex is developed and provided by &quot;Data Access Worldwide&quot;, a software company with main offices in Miami, Florida, Hengelo, Netherlands, and São Paulo, Brazil.

==Features==
The DataFlex language supports: 
*Supports many database environments: Oracle database, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM Db2, MySQL, PostgreSQL as well as any ODBC database.
*Easily switch between database backends, no code change needed.
*Variables are loosely typed. The virtual machine takes care of conversions.
*Flexibility; the language is object oriented, so developers can create subclasses and libraries.
*Code compiles to an intermediate byte-code which makes the programs easily portable between operating systems.
*No threads or multitasking
*Methods can - for ease of coding - be defined or redefined inside the object definition. Technically the compiler simply sub-classes the superclass and adds the methods to the class.
*Automatic delegation of messages in the object-oriented programming environment
*Embedded Database access is ISAM-based. It can be used royalty-free.

==Language Extension==
*Functions defined in Dynamic Link Libraries can be used.
*Classes, methods and properties defined in a COM module can be used. COM automation, controls and embedding is supported.

==Development environments==
The DataFlex programming language is used in the following development environments:

;DataFlex Studio: This is the flagship visual development environment from Data Access Worldwide. DataFlex is available for Microsoft Windows only. DataFlex is a GUI development language in a style comparable with Visual Basic, Delphi and C++. From version 4 (1996) up until version 17.1 (2015), the product was labeled Visual DataFlex.
;DataFlex WebApp Server: Available for Microsoft IIS only, the DataFlex WebApp Server can be used to develop thin client applications such as browser-based applications (both full class browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Opera, as well as WAP browsers). Developers can also create Web Service client and server applications. The server has built-in load balancing capabilities which also assist with High Availability, this does, however, require an SPLF license. 
;Web Framework: DataFlex includes a web framework for writing web and mobile applications.
;Character mode DataFlex: The latest iteration of the original character mode application (3.2) is available as a &quot;Console Mode&quot; application for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and Unix variants (notably Linux).

<doc id="742545" wikidata="Q883468" url="?curid=742545" title="Silas Woodson">
<text>Silas Woodson (May 18, 1819October 9, 1896) was the 21st Governor of Missouri between January 3, 1873, and January 12, 1875. He was notable for being the first Democrat elected to that position since the Civil War. No Republican would reach the office for over 30 years after Woodson&#x27;s election.

==Early life==

Woodson was born in Barbourville, Kentucky, to mother Alice (Chick), and father Wade Netherland Woodson

He was the most outspoken opponent of slavery at Kentucky&#x27;s 1849 constitutional convention and left the state after the passage of the 1850 constitution enshrined it in state law.

==Legal career==

Woodson became a lawyer. In 1846 he became partners with Samuel Freeman Miller. Woodson gained a reputation as a trial lawyer. On June 20, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Woodson as Chief Justice of the Idaho Territorial Supreme Court. The senate judiciary committee reported Woodson&#x27;s nomination adversely, and the senate laid his nomination on the table on June 30. After congress adjourned, Lincoln gave Woodson a recess appointment to the position on July 28, 1864. He resigned his commission in January 1865, without having set foot in the Idaho Territory.

==Political career==

Woodson had made one previously unsuccessful attempt for the Missouri Legislature in 1868, but was chosen to run in 1873 against Republican Senator John B. Henderson. Woodson beat Henderson 156,777 votes to 121,889.

In his inaugural address, Governor Woodson spoke about education, in particular defending the Democratic position regarding common schools. Historian Arthur Lee commented this showed the institutionalization of public schooling in Missouri.

As part of his time as governor, Woodson brought a case against Pacific Railroad for non-payment of a state-issued debt. The Railroad had contended that it was unable to repay $2 million lent to it due to the impact of the Civil War. Woodson had responded by attempting a sale of the Railroad in default. In the 1874 case of &quot;Woodson v Murdock&quot;, the Supreme Court found in favor of the Railroad.

In 1875, Silas Woodson was briefly investigated for his role in co-signing certificates issued during the Civil War by the Crafton Commission. Woodson owned $198,045 worth of the certificates personally. He was exonerated after it was shown that Crafton had been forging then-Governor Woodson&#x27;s signature on certificates for defective muster rolls.

==Death==
Woodson died in St. Joseph, Missouri. He is buried there at the Mount Mora Cemetery. His headstone was vandalized in October 2006.

<text>Awards and decorations of Nazi Germany were military, political, and civilian decorations that were bestowed between 1923 and 1945, first by the Nazi Party and later the state of Nazi Germany.

The first awards began in the 1920s, before the Nazis had come to national power in Germany, with the political decorations worn on Party uniforms, along with any awards they may have earned during the First World War or before.

After 1933, the state began issuing a variety of civilian decorations, which could be bestowed upon any citizen of Germany. Thus, some awards (such as Sports Badges) were bestowed on Nazi Party members, members of the German military, and regular civilians. Many standard awards of the German state, such as life-saving medals, were redesigned to incorporate the Nazi symbol, the swastika.

A number of military awards were established pre-war, including &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; long service decorations, followed by awards for participation in the Spanish Civil War and for the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland, with the greatest number established after the start of World War II in 1939. Regulations of award also permitted the simultaneous wear of military, civilian, and political decorations on any military or paramilitary uniform of Nazi Germany.
Nazi awards and decorations were discontinued after the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, with display of the swastika banned. In 1957 the Federal Republic of Germany permitted qualifying veterans to wear many Nazi-era awards on the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; uniform, including most World War II valor and campaign awards, provided the swastika symbol was removed. This led to the re-design of many awards with, for example, the swastika being replaced by a three-leafed oakleaf cluster (see picture) on the Iron Cross and by the date &quot;1939&quot; on the War Merit Cross.

<doc id="742555" wikidata="Q7452396" url="?curid=742555" title="Sepulveda Dam">
<text>The Sepulveda Dam is a dry dam constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to withhold winter flood waters along the Los Angeles River. Completed in 1941, at a cost of $6,650,561 (), it is located south of center in the San Fernando Valley, approximately east of the river&#x27;s source in the western end of the Valley, in Los Angeles, California.

Sepulveda Dam, along with Hansen Dam located in the north San Fernando Valley, was constructed in response to the historic 1938 floods which killed 144 people. The dam&#x27;s capacity would allow it to hold back roughly of runoff from the of catchment upstream. It was placed at what was the then-current edge of the city. East of the dam, the river was crowded into a narrow channel by the city&#x27;s growth. The flood control basin is a large and undeveloped area in the center of the Valley, used mostly for wildlife refuge and recreation. After the 1938 Los Angeles River flood, the channelization of all the Valley&#x27;s dry washes was created with dry, concrete-lined river bottoms. Currently these are being devolved in part as interconnecting bike paths.
Behind the dam, the Sepulveda Basin is home to several large recreation areas including Woodley Park, a model aircraft field, The Japanese Garden, a wildlife refuge, a water reclamation plant, and an armory. The facilities are compatible with occasional inundation from reservoir impoundment.

It is a location for films (such as &quot;Escape from New York&quot;), music videos (such as BTS&#x27;s &quot;On (Kinetic Manifesto)&quot; They Might Be Giants&#x27; &quot;The Statue Got Me High&quot; and Keedy&#x27;s &quot;Save Some Love&quot;), and car commercials.

==History==

When the 1914 flood caused $10 million in damages to the developing basin areas, a public outcry began for action to address the recurring flooding problems. During the following year, the Los Angeles County Flood Control District was formed. Some of the early flood control efforts included smaller areas of channelization and the planning for needed reservoirs. Taxpayers approved bond issues in 1917 and 1924 to build the first major dams. However, they were not willing to provide enough funding for the much needed and substantial infrastructure downstream of these dams. After two more destructive floods in the 1930s, most notably the 1938 flood, federal assistance was requested. The Army Corps of Engineers took a lead role in channelizing the river and constructing several dams which would create flood control basins behind them. Channelization began in 1938, and by 1960 the project was completed to form the present engineered waterway. Included in this work were Hansen Dam, completed in 1940 and followed by Sepulveda Dam in 1941. In 1973, Burbank Boulevard was built through the Sepulveda Basin, and Woodley Ave was also built in the recreation area in 1975.

During the 2028 Summer Olympics, the area around the dam will host Archery, BMX/Cycling and Skateboarding.

==Access==
Transit users can exit the G Line at either Balboa station or Woodley station.

==Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area==
The Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area is a flood control basin in Encino managed by the Los Angeles City Department of Recreation and Parks.

===Woodley Park===
Woodley Park is a large city park located on Woodley Avenue between Victory and Burbank Boulevards. The Leo Magnus Cricket Complex, a dog park, and group picnic areas are within the park. The park was opened in 1975.

The Japanese Garden is a public Japanese garden located on the grounds of the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant adjacent to Woodley Park.

===Lake Balboa Park===
Lake Balboa Park, also known as Anthony C. Beilenson Park, is an park and water recreation facility with boat rentals and fishing. Lake Balboa is a lake filled with water reclaimed from the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant. It also has barbecue pits, children&#x27;s play area, picnic tables, and covered picnic pavilions. There are many Flowering cherry trees (&quot;Prunus serrulata&quot; &#x27;Pink Cloud&#x27;) in the park.

The Balboa Station on the G Line is located at the north end of the park, at Balboa Boulevard.

===Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve===
The Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve is at the southeast end of the Sepulveda Flood Control Basin and Recreation Area. It has two sections, the North Reserve and South Reserve, located north and south of Burbank Boulevard. Both have nature paths and hiking trails. Access and parking are in eastern Woodley Park near to the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, or from Burbank Boulevard east of Woodley Avenue.

Haskell Creek flows through the nature preserve, and there are several wildlife ponds. Over 200 species of birds have been seen in the basin. Many, attracted by the water, gather here during fall and spring migrations. The Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve is an ongoing habitat restoration project, with locally native California plants. Native trees include Fremont&#x27;s cottonwood (&quot;Populus fremontii&quot;), Coast live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia &quot;), Valley Oak (&quot;Quercus lobata&quot;), California Black Walnut (&quot;Juglans californica&quot;), and California sycamore (&quot;Platanus racemosa&quot;).

===Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area Bike Path===

The Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area Bike Path is a bicycle path route looping around the recreation area. This &quot;very popular bike path&quot; runs from Victory Boulevard near the San Diego Freeway (I-405), westward to White Oak Avenue, south on White Oak to Burbank Boulevard, east on Burbank to Woodley Boulevard, and north on Woodley returning to Victory Boulevard. Public access is continuous along it. The ride features no steep or sustained hills, and has a maximum grade of no more than 2%.

A shorter route heads south on Balboa Boulevard, which crosses a natural stretch of the Los Angeles River that lined with native Arroyo willows, California sycamores, and other California native plants.

The bikeway &quot;cruises around the Balboa Sports Center and several golf courses, and has several open areas with spectacular views of into the mountains to the north and east.&quot;

The loop sections along Victory and Burbank can be frequented by joggers. The bike path can seasonally have burr-bearing weeds, which may cause flats in less durable tires. The Apollo II Model Airplane Field is visible from the path.

There is ample free parking available in the public park, sports field, and/or golf course parking lots on Burbank, Woodley and Balboa Boulevards.

&quot;Not all of [the park’s bike paths] show up on the official city Rec and Parks map or Google maps. The bike paths connect to play areas along Lake Balboa, several bathrooms, natural areas (including a natural soft-bottom stretch of the L.A. River), and to the cross-valley Orange Line bike path.&quot;

To access the park from the Orange Bikeway start at Victory Boulevard and Balboa Boulevard, go south, then turn east on a bike way.

The Sepulveda Basin bike paths are accessible from Granada Hills via the Class III path on Woodley Ave.

===Sepulveda Basin River Recreation Zone===
The Sepulveda Basin River Recreation Zone extends from above Balboa Boulevard to the confluence of Haskell Creek below Burbank Boulevard. It is open for recreational non-motorized boating during the summer, with restricted access to some protected wildlife areas along the banks.

===Other facilities===
Other recreation facilities within the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area include:
*Balboa Sports Complex, with a children&#x27;s play area, community room, indoor gym; and lighted: baseball diamonds, basketball courts, soccer fields, football field, handball courts, tennis courts, and volleyball courts.
*Hjelte Sports Center, with softball diamonds.

<text>Philip Matthew Donnelly (March 6, 1891 – September 12, 1961) was an American politician serving as the 41st and 43rd Governor of Missouri. He was a Democrat. Donnelly and Christopher S. &quot;Kit&quot; Bond are the only Missouri governors to serve two non-consecutive terms.

==Personal history==
Donnelly was born in Lebanon, Missouri, in 1891, the son of Phil and Margaret (Halloran) Donnelly. Following his graduation from Lebanon High School in 1909 Donnelly attended St. Louis University, earning a law degree in 1913. Donnelly returned to his native Lebanon and entered private practice with J.W. Farris. In 1915 he wed Miss Juanita McFadden. They had one child, a son David, who himself became an attorney and joined his father&#x27;s law practice.

==Political history==
Soon after his passing of the Missouri Bar and return to Lebanon Donnelly expressed an interest in politics. His first office was that of Lebanon city attorney, followed by election to one term as Laclede County prosecutor. Phil Donnelly entered state politics in 1922 by being elected State Representative for the Laclede County area. After one term in the House he was elected to Missouri State Senate in 1924 and remained there for the next twenty years. Senator Donnelly became Governor Donnelly for the first time after winning the 1944 gubernatorial race.

Highlights of his first term as governor included overseeing the implementation of a new Missouri state constitution in 1946, creation of the Missouri Department of Revenue, and welcoming international statesman Winston Churchill to Fulton, Missouri, for the famous Iron Curtain speech at Westminster College. Missouri law prohibited someone from serving two consecutive terms as governor, so Donnelly was ineligible to run again in 1948. However, he ran for governor again in 1952 and won easily. Following his second term, a first in Missouri history, he semi-retired to a law practice in Lebanon with his son. Phil M. Donnelly died September 12, 1961, and is buried in the Lebanon, Missouri city cemetery.

==Honors==
:*Honorary Doctor of Law degrees were bestowed on Governor Donnelly by Washington University in 1949 Westminster College, and William Jewell College.
:*Donnelly Elementary School in Lebanon, Missouri is named for the late Governor.
:*Donnelly Hall, formerly a residence hall (1961–2004) at University of Missouri was named in honor of the governor.

<text>Lucien Gaulard (16 July 1850 – 26 November 1888) was a French engineer who invented devices for the transmission of alternating current electrical energy.

==Biography==
Gaulard was born in Paris, France in 1850.

A power transformer developed by Gaulard of France and John Dixon Gibbs of England was demonstrated in London, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. Gaulard and Gibbs first exhibited a device in London in 1881 and then sold the idea to the American company Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884, where it was adopted for an electric lighting system. Many of the features of their design were adapted to the particular laws governing electrical distribution in the UK.

In 1882, 1884, and 1885 Gaulard and Gibbs applied for patents on their transformer; however, these were overturned due to actions initiated by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti and others.

Their open-core device used a fixed 1:1 ratio to supply a series circuit for the utilization load (lamps). The voltage of their fixed 1:1 ratio system was reduced and controlled by pushing in and pulling out its open iron core.

In 1885, William Stanley, Jr. built the first practical American transformer based on Gaulard and Gibbs&#x27;s idea, the precursor of the modern transformer. Transformers were nothing new, but the Gaulard-Gibbs design was one of the first that could handle large amounts of power and promised to be easy to manufacture. Westinghouse imported a number of Gaulard-Gibbs transformers and a Siemens AC generator to begin experimenting with AC networks in Pittsburgh.

Gaulard died in an institution (Sainte-Anne Hospital) in Paris, and was said to have lost his reason due to the loss of the patents on his invention. Several months before his death, Gaulard appeared at the Elysee asking the concierge to conduct him to the president of France, for whom, he said, he had an urgent message. The message was &quot;I am God and God does not wait&quot;. He has been described as an inventor whose ingenuity cost him not only his money, but reason and life as well. A tablet was erected to Gaulard at Lanzo Torinese.

<text>William Thomas Sampson (February 9, 1840 – May 6, 1902) was a United States Navy rear admiral known for his victory in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish–American War.

==Biography==
He was born in Palmyra, New York, and entered the United States Naval Academy on September 24, 1857. After graduating first in his class four years later, he served as an instructor at the academy, teaching physics. In 1864, he became the executive officer of the monitor of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and engaged in sweeping torpedoes off Charleston, South Carolina. He survived the loss of that ironclad on January 15, 1865, when she struck a torpedo, exploded, and sank with a loss of 75 lives.

Following duty on the steam frigate with the European Squadron, another tour as instructor at the Naval Academy, and in the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy Department, he served in the screw sloop . He then commanded the , the training ship , and the while on duty at the Naval Academy.

During the next years, he was Assistant to the Superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory, then Officer-in-Charge of the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island. On September 9, 1886, he became Superintendent of the Naval Academy. He was promoted to captain on April 9, 1889, reported to the Mare Island Navy Yard to fit out the protected cruiser , and assumed command when she was commissioned on November 15, 1889. He was detached in June 1892 to serve as Inspector of Ordnance in the Washington Navy Yard and was appointed Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance on January 28, 1893. He assumed command of the battleship on June 15, 1897. On February 17, 1898, he was made President of the Board of Inquiry to investigate the destruction of the . On March 26, 1898, he assumed command of the North Atlantic Squadron, with the temporary rank of rear admiral.

===Spanish–American War===

The United States declared war against Spain on April 25, 1898; and, eight days later, Admiral Pascual Cervera&#x27;s fleet sailed from the Cape Verde Islands for an uncertain destination. Rear Admiral Sampson, in flagship , put to sea from Key West. Sampson&#x27;s early involvement in the conflict included his supervision of the Cuban blockade, which lasted for the duration of the war, as well as the bombardment of the city of San Juan on May 12, 1898. After initially being sent to blockade Havana itself, Sampson was given orders to intercept Admiral Cervera&#x27;s squadron, but with only a vague notion of Cervera&#x27;s current location, he was unable to actively pursue. Awaiting further information on Cervera&#x27;s whereabouts, Sampson sailed east to San Juan and carried out a bombardment on May 12 that lasted several hours, dealing minor infrastructural damage to the city. After this preliminary bombardment, Sampson helped lead a land-sea attack on San Juan Hill, along with General William Shafter, taking the city of Santiago de Cuba. On July 1, following the successful invasion, Sampson returned to Puerto Rico, reinforcing the blockade in San Juan.

On May 29, elements of Sampson&#x27;s command spotted Admiral Cervera&#x27;s squadron moving into Santiago harbor and the naval presence there was greatly increased to prevent Cervera&#x27;s escape. On the morning of July 3, 1898, Cervera&#x27;s fleet came out of the harbor. Sampson was ashore at a conference with General Shafter, making plans for a coordinated attack on Santiago. Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley was in command of the Flying Squadron in Sampson&#x27;s absence and met the Spanish fleet, completely destroying every Spanish vessel in a running sea battle lasting five hours. The next day, Rear Admiral Sampson sent his famous message: &quot;The Fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present, the whole of Cervera&#x27;s Fleet&quot;.

Sampson&#x27;s message omitted any mention of Schley&#x27;s leadership in the battle, leading to a controversy as to who was responsible for the victory. While Sampson also arguably played a significant role in the victory, having laid down the strategic framework and determining the favorable positions of his own forces, it was of course Schley who had actually commanded the fleet during the battle. Schley appealed for a court of inquiry, which he got in 1901. In the Navy, the quarrel was so divisive that the rank-and-file identified themselves as either a &quot;Schley man&quot; or a &quot;Sampson man.&quot; The court of inquiry heard testimony in support of Schley by his own men and, despite some criticism of Schley, exonerated the commander of the Flying Squadron.

After the Battle of Santiago Bay, Sampson was appointed Cuban Commissioner on August 20, 1898, but resumed command of the North Atlantic Fleet in December. He became Commandant of the Boston Navy Yard in October 1899 and transferred to the Retired List on February 9, 1902.

Sampson was a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Military Order of Foreign Wars. He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) by Yale University in October 1901, during celebrations for the bicentenary of the university.

* The United States Navy also authorized a service medal, officially named the West Indies Naval Campaign Medal but better known as the Sampson Medal, to recognize those who had served under his command during the Spanish–American War. The obverse of the medal bears Sampson&#x27;s image and, thus, Sampson was one of only four Americans in history entitled to wear an official medal with their own image on it. (The others were Admiral George Dewey, General John J. Pershing and Admiral Richard E. Byrd.)
* The former Sampson Naval Training Base, that became the Sampson Air Force Base and is now a New York State Park on the eastern shore of Seneca Lake were named in his honor. Approved by President Roosevelt in 1942, 498 buildings were constructed on of farmland in the Finger Lakes near Palmyra, New York by 15,500 workers in 270 days so that 411,000 sailors could be trained before the facility closed in 1946. The facility was converted to the Sampson Air Force Base for the Korean War and between 1950 and 1956 over 300,000 airmen had their basic training there. Even though the facility is now the Sampson State Park, known for its herd of white deer, it has returned to military duty now that the Sampson Veterans Memorial Cemetery has been completed.
* A Brooklyn, New York elementary school, PS 160, was named in his honor.
* The steamship was named in his honor. It was built in 1898 and sank in Puget Sound in 1914.

<text>Anthony Michael Lazzeri (December 6, 1903 – August 6, 1946) was an American professional baseball second baseman during the 1920s and 1930s, predominantly with the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was part of the famed &quot;Murderers&#x27; Row&quot; Yankee batting lineup of the late 1920s (including the 1927 team), along with Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Bob Meusel.

Lazzeri was born and raised in San Francisco, California. He dropped out of school to work with his father as a boilermaker, but at the age of 18, began to play baseball professionally. After playing in minor league baseball from 1922 through 1925, Lazzeri joined the Yankees in 1926. He was a member of the original American League All-Star team in 1933. He was nicknamed &quot;Poosh &#x27;Em Up&quot; by Italian-speaking fans, from a mistranslation of an Italian phrase meaning to &quot;hit it out&quot; (hit a home run).

Lazzeri is one of only 14 major league baseball players to hit for the natural cycle (hitting a single, double, triple and home run in sequence) and the only player to complete a natural cycle with a grand slam. He also holds the American League record for the most RBI in a single game, with 11 on May 24, 1936. In that same 1936 game, he became the first major league player to hit two grand slams in one game. Lazzeri was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1991.

==Early life==
Lazzeri was born on December 6, 1903, to Augustine and Julia Lazzeri, who had emigrated from Italy. They lived in the Cow Hollow district of San Francisco. Augustine worked as a boilermaker.

At age 15, Lazzeri was expelled from school. He began to work with his father, earning $4.50 a day ($ in current dollar terms). Lazzeri also played semi-professional baseball and trained to become a prizefighter.

==Minor league career==
A friend of Lazzeri convinced Duffy Lewis, who managed the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), to allow Lazzeri to try out for the team in 1922. Lazzeri made the team, earning $250 a month ($ in current dollar terms) as a utility infielder. He batted .192 in 45 games, and was demoted to the Peoria Tractors of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League in 1923 to gain more experience.

Lazzeri batted .248 with 14 home runs in 135 games for Peoria, before being recalled to Salt Lake City. Starting at shortstop for the Bees in 1924, Lazzeri batted .285 with 16 home runs. However, Lewis gave the starting shortstop role to Pinky Pittenger, and sent Lazzeri to the Lincoln Links of the Western League, where he batted .329 with 28 home runs in 82 games.

Returning to Salt Lake City under new manager Oscar Vitt in 1925, Lazzeri batted .355 with 60 home runs and 222 runs batted in (RBIs), the most RBIs in professional baseball history. That year he became one of what are today four Pacific Coast League hitters to have had a 30 home runs, 30 stolen bases season, along with Joc Pederson (2014), Frank Demaree (1934), and Lefty O&#x27;Doul (1927). Though Salt Lake City had a working agreement with the Chicago Cubs, the Cubs passed on Lazzeri due to his epilepsy. The Cincinnati Reds passed on Lazzeri as well. Bill Essick, a scout for the New York Yankees, convinced Ed Barrow, the Yankees&#x27; general manager, to sign Lazzeri. Barrow agreed after receiving confirmatory reports from other scouts, including Ed Holly and Paul Krichell, as well as ensuring that Lazzeri&#x27;s insurance policy would cover his illness.

==New York Yankees==
After the 1925 season, Barrow purchased Lazzeri from Salt Lake City in exchange for the rights to Frank Zoeller and Mack Hillis and $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Lazzeri signed a contract with the Yankees worth $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms).
Lazzeri debuted in the major leagues in 1926 as a member of the Yankees. Manager Miller Huggins moved Lazzeri from shortstop to second base. Huggins paired Lazzeri with Mark Koenig, also a rookie, as his double play combination. In his rookie season, playing all 155 games, Lazzeri hit 18 home runs and had 114 RBIs. He finished third in the American League (AL) in home runs behind Babe Ruth and Al Simmons, and tied for third in RBIs with George Burns, trailing only Ruth. The Yankees reached the 1926 World Series, losing to the St. Louis Cardinals. In a bases loaded situation in the seventh inning of the deciding game, Grover Cleveland Alexander struck out Lazzeri to save the series for the Cardinals.

With the 1927 Yankees, known as &quot;Murderer&#x27;s Row&quot; due to the strength of their batting lineup, Lazzeri batted .309 with 18 home runs and 102 RBIs. He finished third in the AL in home runs, behind only teammates Ruth and Lou Gehrig. The Yankees finished the season with a 110–44 win–loss record, and defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1927 World Series. Baseball experts solicited by Billy Evans named Lazzeri the consensus best second baseman in the AL. He incurred a muscle injury that threatened to end his season. Nevertheless, Lazzeri returned to the team, and hit a key double off of Alexander in the 1928 World Series, which the Yankees won. Despite the games he missed, Lazzeri tied Joe Judge for third place in Most Valuable Player voting, with the award being won by Mickey Cochrane.

Lazzeri had his career-high batting average of .354 in 1929. He hit two home runs for the Yankees in their 1932 World Series victory. In 1933, Lazzeri was named to appear in the first MLB All-Star Game, representing the AL against the National League (NL). He had a knee injury during the 1934 season.

Lazzeri set an AL single-game record on May 24, 1936, when he recorded eleven RBIs. That month, he also set records for most home runs in three consecutive games (6) and four consecutive games (7). He hit a grand slam during the 1936 World Series, only the second grand slam in World Series history. Lazzeri scored the deciding run in the 1937 World Series, as the Yankees defeated the New York Giants.

As a member of the Yankees through 1937, he averaged 79 runs, 14 home runs, 96 RBIs and 12 stolen bases, including seven seasons with over 100 RBI and five seasons batting .300 or higher (including a high of .354 in 1929). During this period, the Yankees won six American League pennants (1926, 1927, 1928, 1932, 1936 and 1937) and five World Series championships (1927, 1928, 1932, 1936 and 1937).

==Later career==
The Yankees released Lazzeri following the 1937 season. He signed with the Cubs as a player-coach for the 1938 season. Though he received little playing time, the Cubs won the NL championship and appeared in the 1938 World Series against the Yankees, which the Yankees won. The Cubs released Lazzeri after the season, and he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the 1939 season. However, the Dodgers released him on May 13, after he batted .282 in 14 games. The next day, Lazzeri signed with the New York Giants, to replace George Myatt and Lou Chiozza at third base. Lazzeri received his release on June 7.

Lazzeri then returned to minor league baseball, where he managed the Class-AA Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League for the remainder of the 1939 season and entire 1940 season.

He played for the San Francisco Seals of the PCL in 1941, and was released after the season.

He played for and managed the Portsmouth Cubs of the Piedmont League in 1942.

Lazzeri served as player-manager of the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Class-AA Eastern League in 1943, posting a .271 batting average in 58 games. However, he was asked to resign after that season.

==Personal life==
Before the 1923 season, Lazzeri married Maye Janes. The couple had one child, David Anthony Lazzeri (1931–2013).

==Death==
Lazzeri died in 1946 at age 42 from a fall the coroner said was caused by a heart attack in his Millbrae, California home. However, today, many believe Lazzeri&#x27;s fall was caused more from an epileptic seizure rather than a heart attack.

==Legacy==
Although his offensive production was overshadowed by the historic accomplishments of teammates such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio, Lazzeri is still considered one of the top hitting second basemen of his era. Koenig considered Lazzeri the team&#x27;s most valuable player. He finished his career with a .292 batting average, 986 runs, 178 home runs, 1,191 RBI and 148 stolen bases. Despite his hitting 60 home runs in an extended PCL season in 1925, Lazzeri never hit more than 18 home runs in a major league season (a mark he reached four times).

Lazzeri holds the American League record for most RBIs in a game with 11, set May 24, 1936, as he also became the first major league player to hit two grand slams in one game. He holds the major league record of 15 RBIs in consecutive games (one more than Rudy York in 1946 and Sammy Sosa in 2002). He also set major league records of six home runs in three consecutive games, and seven in four consecutive games. Lazzeri continues to share the consecutive-game American League record, but the three-game record was topped by Shawn Green of the Dodgers (seven in 2002) and the four-game mark was broken by Ralph Kiner of the Pittsburgh Pirates (eight in 1947). Lazzeri is also the only player in major league baseball to hit a natural cycle with the final home run being a grand slam on June 3, 1932.

The Veterans Committee elected Lazzeri to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991.

<text>Interlagos is a neighborhood located in the district of Socorro in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Its name comes from the fact that the region is located between two large reservoirs, Guarapiranga and Billings, built in the early 20th century to supply water and electric power to the city. The suburb of Interlagos is located in the south region of São Paulo City on the east bank of the Guarapiranga reservoir.

The Autódromo José Carlos Pace itself is still commonly called Interlagos, although that has not been its official name since the 1970s, and it is actually located in the district of Cidade Dutra, not Socorro.

The history of the Interlagos circuit dates back to the 1920s, when the city of São Paulo was undergoing a process of fast urbanization.
&quot;Colégio Humboldt São Paulo&quot;, a German international school, is located in Interlagos.

<doc id="742578" wikidata="Q626634" url="?curid=742578" title="University of Texas–Pan American">
<text>The University of Texas–Pan American (UTPA) was a public university in Edinburg, Texas. Founded in 1927, it was a component institution of the University of Texas System. The university served the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas with baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. The Carnegie Foundation classified UTPA as a &quot;doctoral research university&quot;. From the institution&#x27;s founding until it was merged into the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), it grew from 200 students to over 20,000, making UTPA the 10th-largest university in Texas. The majority of these students were natives of the Rio Grande Valley. UTPA also operated an Upper Level Studies Center in Rio Grande City, Starr County, Texas. On August 15, 2014, Dr. Havidan Rodriguez was appointed interim President of UTPA, the institution&#x27;s final leader.

In 2015, UTRGV entered into operation following the merger of UTPA and UT–Brownsville, founded as an extension of then-Pan American University at Texas Southmost College. UTRGV also created a new medical school.

On August 31, 2015, UTPA formally ceased operations to yield to the newly formed university, the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

==History==
===Edinburg College===
Edinburg College was founded in 1927 as a junior college administered by the Edinburg School District. It was formally designated as a junior college in 1933 as Edinburg Junior College, and admitted to the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of Southern States.

===Pan American College===
Hidalgo County held a referendum for a four-year university in 1951; the school became Pan American Regional College on December 20, 1951. Its name changed to Pan American College in January 1952, followed by the appointment of a board of regents. The first graduate to receive a four-year degree was Harold W. Billings, BA, in 1953. It became the 22nd member institution of the Texas System of Colleges and Universities in 1965, as a state senior college.

===Pan American University===
Approved to offer graduate programs in 1970, the school began with Master of Arts, Master of Education, and Master of Science degrees. In 1971, Pan American College achieved full university status and changed its name to Pan American University. In the 20-year period from 1965 to 1984, enrollment grew from 2,000 to nearly 10,000. A second campus at Brownsville was established in 1973 (which became the University of Texas at Brownsville, and later merged with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley).

===The University of Texas–Pan American===
In December 1988, board members reached merger agreement with the University of Texas System pending state legislative approval (one of a series of similar mergers among state universities during that time), granted in September 1989. It adopted its final name subsequent to entry into the UT System, preserving the nearly 40-year legacy of the Pan American name.

===Merger with UTB and Medical School===
On December 6, 2012, University of Texas regents approved a proposal to merge UTPA, the UT-Brownsville, and a planned medical school into one regional institution. On December 12, 2013, the UT Board of Regents voted to name the new organization the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

On November 5, 2014, UTRGV&#x27;s new nickname of Vaqueros was announced. Almost immediately, students on both campuses began objecting to the new name as a caricature and racial stereotype of Mexican, Latino, Chicano, and Hispanic culture. Two days after the new mascot was approved, the UTPA student government passed a resolution in opposition, and three days later, hundreds of students rallied on the Edinburg campus to protest the new name.

On August 31, 2015, UTB was officially dissolved and UTPA&#x27;s name was changed to the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

==Campus==
===Main campus===
UTPA&#x27;s main campus, now one of the primary campuses of UTRGV, is located in the western part of Edinburg, and comprises 289 acres.

Most of the academic buildings are enclosed by or span a covered walkway over the perimeter of the original campus. In 2007, UTPA added a new wellness center, and dormitory (Unity Dormitory 2007). On the northeast corner of campus is the Edinburg Baseball Stadium, which is considered one of the premier college baseball settings. The stadium was completed in 2001.

===Starr County Upper-Level Center===
The Starr Country Upper-Level Center is located in Rio Grande City. The center opened in 2003 and was rededicated and moved to a new location in 2009. Most courses offered are in bilingual education. There are also limited courses in criminal justice, history, English, and anthropology. over 200 students have graduated from the Starr County Upper-Level Center.

===Coastal Studies Laboratory===
Established in 1973, the Coastal Studies Laboratory (CSL) began as UTPA&#x27;s marine biology laboratory and now serves the same role for UTRGV. It is located in the city of South Padre Island, which is located about 70 miles east of main campus. The CSL offers graduate-level biology courses and houses several ecological programs that are independent of UTPA.

===McAllen Teaching Site===
The McAllen Teaching Site was opened in 2009 in McAllen, Texas, and offers education and business courses. The site primarily serves professionals in the city of McAllen.

==Academics==
The university offered a wide variety of degrees spanning across seven colleges. At the time of the UTRGV merger, there were 56 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 56 master&#x27;s degrees, three doctoral degrees, and two cooperative doctoral programs.

===Colleges===
The university included these academic divisions:

* College of Arts and Humanities
* College of Business Administration
* College of Education
* College of Engineering and Computer Science
* College of Health Sciences and Human Services
* College of Science and Mathematics
* College of Social and Behavioral Sciences
* College of Physics and Geology

===Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps===
* The University of Texas–Pan American hosted the college-based Army ROTC program, which was carried on by UTRGV.

===Rankings===
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rated UTPA as a tier 2 University.

In &quot;Forbes&quot;″ 2009 best college rankings that heavily weighted proportion of graduates who obtain a job upon graduation, UTPA ranked 32nd among public universities and 218th among all universities. Among public schools in Texas, UTPA ranked only behind the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&amp;M.

In 2009 UTPA ranked behind only Florida International University for bachelor&#x27;s degrees awarded to Hispanic students.

According to the U.S. government, among schools with an enrollment of at least 5,000 students, UTPA ranked as the second-most affordable school in the nation.
===Admissions, enrollment, and retention===
Historically, UTPA had open enrollment such that any student able to graduate from an approved public or private high school was granted admission. This policy was implemented by former president Miguel Nevarez. After Nevarez retired, UTPA moved towards minimum admission standards. The minimum standards for fall 2011 admission were a diploma from a recognized high school and a combined math/verbal SAT score of 860 or an ACT score of 18. Additionally, the minimum criteria were met with a SAT score of 810 or ACT score of 17 if the applicant is in the top third of his/her graduating class or an SAT score of 760 or ACT score of 16 sufficed if the applicant was in the top quarter of his/her graduating class. Any student who graduates from a recognized Texas high school as a member of the top 10% of his/her graduating class is guaranteed admission.

In 1997, UTPA started the University Scholars Program in an attempt to retain top local high-school students. The program is an objective academic scholarship based on three tiers. The first tier is high-school graduation standing. The second tier is advanced placement testing. The third tier is standardized testing scores. UTPA guaranteed full tuition funding for any student who meets one of many objective minimum requirements in all three tiers.

UTPA&#x27;s first- to second-year retention rate for full-time students was 71%. UTPA&#x27;s four-year graduation rate is 13% and the 6-year graduation rate is 36%. The proportion of students who receive some sort of financial aid is 86%.

==Student life==
===Housing===
All students under the age of 21 who have earned fewer than 30 credit hours are required to reside on campus unless they are married, a parent, or have a permanent residence within 60 miles of campus. UTPA offers three residence halls and one building of community of on-campus apartments. Troxel Hall and Heritage Hall are the oldest residence halls on campus, and until 2000, were the only residence options for students. Heritage Hall is an all-female residence hall. At the end of 2009, Troxel Hall closed due to low capacity. In 2000 the Bronc Village Apartments were completed on north campus and offered students 1, 2 and 4 bedroom options. In fall 2006, Unity Hall was opened as the first new residence hall in more than 30 years; it has 204 double rooms and is divided into male and female wings. Heritage Hall, Unity Hall and the Bronc Village apartments combined can hold around 800 students

==Athletics==
===Teams===
Before the UTRGV merger, the University of Texas–Pan American sponsored eight men&#x27;s and nine women&#x27;s teams in NCAA-sanctioned sports. About a year before the merger, the UT System announced that UTRGV would inherit the UTPA athletic program, and the UTPA Broncs officially became the UTRGV Vaqueros on July 1, 2015.

<text>Annie Golden (born October 19, 1951) is an American actress and singer. She first came to prominence as the lead singer of the punk band the Shirts from 1975 to 1981 with whom she recorded three albums. She began her acting career as Mother in the 1977 Broadway revival of &quot;Hair&quot;; later taking on the role of Jeannie Ryan in the 1979 film version of the musical. Other notable film credits include &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985), &quot;Baby Boom&quot; (1987), &quot;Longtime Companion&quot; (1989), &quot;Strictly Business&quot; (1991), &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot; (1992), &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), &quot;The American Astronaut&quot; (2001), &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot; (2003), &quot;Adventures of Power&quot; (2008), and &quot;I Love You Phillip Morris&quot; (2009).

In 1985–1986 she appeared as the recurring character Tommy in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, and from 1989 to 1992 she portrayed the recurring role of Margaret O&#x27;Keefe on the classic sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. She has appeared as a guest star on several television programs, including &quot;American Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Dear John&quot;, &quot;Father Dowling Mysteries&quot;, &quot;High Maintenance&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, and &quot;True Blue&quot; among others.

Golden was born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York. She sang in school and church choirs as a child. Her father, a Teamster, died at age 52 and her mother died in 1974, at the age of 42. Golden on her family: &quot;My mom never saw me do anything.&quot; She said that she &quot;had no training.&quot; When she met Art LaMonica in 1971, he invited her to join his group called Lackeys &amp; Schemers.

==Career==
=== Music ===
Golden began her career as the lead singer of the Shirts. The band headlined CBGB in the late 1970s and recorded 3 albums for Capitol Records, &quot;The Shirts&quot; (1978), &quot;Street Light Shine&quot; (1979) and &quot;Inner Sleeve&quot; (1980). During the early 1990s she performed as part of the duo Golden Carillo with Frank Carillo. They released three albums, &quot;Fire in Newtown&quot; (1992), &quot;Toxic Emotion&quot; (1994), and &quot;Back for More&quot; (1997). She returned to the Shirts, but she has also performed solo and with a band. In 1984, her song &quot;Hang Up the Phone&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;. She performs a revue of songs from her stage career along with originals called &quot;Annie Golden&#x27;s Velvet Prison&quot;. Golden appeared at Phish&#x27;s New Year Eve concert on December 31, 2023, where she portrayed the grandmother of the character Jimmy from the song &quot;Harpua&quot; during a performance of their Gamehendge song cycle.

=== Film and TV ===
While with the Shirts, Golden was discovered by Miloš Forman, who gave her a part in &quot;Hair&quot;. She had featured roles on the television series &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Golden was the voice of Marina in the Don Bluth animated feature film &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot;. She played a taxi driver in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), wherein she had a scene with Bruce Willis and Madeline Stowe.

In recent years, she has been seen in commercials for Coinstar, in which she portrays the Tooth Fairy. She appears in the musical film &quot;Temptation&quot; with actor Adam Pascal, Tony Award winners Alice Ripley and Anika Noni Rose, and film actress Zoe Saldana and in 2009 had a small role in &quot;I Love You Phillip Morris&quot; with actors Ewan McGregor and Jim Carrey, playing a simple woman requiring legal assistance.

In 2013, she began playing the role of the nearly mute Norma Romano in the Netflix comedy-drama series &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, for which she won a 2015 Screen Actors Guild Award (along with the rest of the ensemble cast).

=== Stage ===
On Broadway, she has appeared in the 1977 revival of &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; (1985), &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; (1988), &quot;On the Town&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Full Monty&quot; (2000). She had the title role in the workshop of the short-lived adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Carrie&quot;. She also played the role of Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman&#x27;s musical &quot;Assassins&quot; during its world premiere at Playwrights Horizons in New York City in 1990–1991, and is featured on the cast recording of it, on the RCA label. In 2003 she joined other original off-Broadway cast members in a &quot;Reprise!&quot; (Los Angeles) concert production of &quot;Assassins&quot;. In 2007, she was stand-by for the two comic villain roles in the musical &quot;Xanadu&quot; on Broadway.

She played Lucy Schmeeler, the whiny friend with the chronic cold, in the off-Broadway Public Theater production at the Delacorte Theater of &quot;On the Town&quot; in August 1997. She also appeared in the lab production of the musical &quot;Hit the Lights!&quot; in 1993 at the Vineyard Theatre.

Golden has appeared in three separate versions of &quot;Hair&quot;: a Broadway revival in 1977, the motion picture in 1979 and a special benefit performance concert in 2004. Golden starred with Peter Scolari in the world premiere of &quot;The Nutcracker and I&quot; from November 29 to December 31, 2011, at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey. Comically playing the Sugar Rush Fairy (and three other roles) in this musical comedy featuring the music of Tchaikovsky and lyrics by Gerard Alessandrini, she and Scolari were compared in one review to the team of Imogene Coca and Sid Caesar.

Golden appeared in the musical &quot;Violet&quot; starring Sutton Foster on Broadway in 2014.

From May 4-15, 2022, Golden appeared as Cinderella&#x27;s Mother/Granny/Giant&#x27;s Wife in the Encores! production of &quot;Into the Woods&quot; at the New York City Center. The production transferred to the St. James Theatre on Broadway, opening on June 28, 2022. Golden stayed with the production until its closing on January 8, 2023.

Since 2005, Golden has frequently appeared in stage concerts for composer Joe Iconis. She starred in the Barrington Stage Company production of his &quot;Broadway Bounty Hunter&quot;, with the book by Iconis, Lance Rubin and Jason &quot;Sweettooth&quot; Williams, directed by Julianne Boyd, which opened on August 13, 2016. This role was written by Iconis for Golden; he said of Golden: &quot;She&#x27;s essentially playing a fictionalized version of herself, so she&#x27;s been so helpful... Her personality has imbued the whole spirit of the show.&quot; The &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;Golden does woebegone really well...Surprisingly, however, the show underserves its star... except for a rousing, climactic paean to “the blood... back in my veins,” the material isn&#x27;t there... There&#x27;s only limited chance to see her take full command of stage and story.&quot; The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; called the musical &quot;rowdy, funny, cheerfully cockeyed.&quot; A concert version of &quot;Broadway Bounty Hunter&quot;, starring Golden, was presented at Joe&#x27;s Pub in New York City on September 26, 2016. She starred in &quot;Broadway Bounty Hunter&quot; at the off-Broadway Greenwich House Theater in July 2019.

<text>Joseph Gerald George McNeil (April 17, 1926 – June 17, 2004) was a professional ice hockey goaltender who won three Stanley Cups with the Montreal Canadiens between 1947 and 1956. With the Canadiens he won the Stanley Cup in 1953.

==Career==
McNeil first signed with the Canadiens in 1943 when he was only 17. While playing with their farm team, the Montreal Royals of the Quebec Senior Hockey League (QSHL), he served as a practice goalie with the Habs whenever they were in Montreal. McNeil won the Byng of Vimy award for the most valuable player three times in the QSHL, and the Royals won the Allan Cup in 1947.
McNeil was called up from the Cincinnati Mohawks of the American Hockey League (AHL) in March 1950 when Montreal&#x27;s goaltender, Bill Durnan, was hit in the head with a skate blade. Teams in this era usually carried a single goalie who played every minute, barring injury. McNeil recorded a 1.50 goals against average (GAA) over six games and preserved Durnan&#x27;s sixth and final Vezina Trophy, then awarded to the goalie who played the most, of the team with the fewest goals against. This rookie performance earned McNeil &quot;the Schaefer player of the week&quot; award. Durnan returned but felt he had lost his edge, so he announced that he sit out a playoff game against the New York Rangers. McNeil initially refused to take &quot;Bill&#x27;s spot,&quot; so Durnan was asked to talk to his understudy in a private part of the dressing room. Both men shed tears, as the &quot;torch&quot; was passed down, and McNeil then succeeded Durnan as Montreal&#x27;s goalie.
McNeil played every game for the Canadiens from March 1950 to November 1952, a streak that included two entire 70-game seasons, 1950–51 and 1951–52. In the 1951 Stanley Cup playoffs, McNeil went 214 minutes of shutout hockey against the powerful Detroit Red Wings, a stretch that included two marathon overtime games at the Detroit Olympia. McNeil made 38 of his 62 game one saves in extra time, a performance that prompted Jack Adams, Detroit&#x27;s general manager, to remark, &quot;It was like running into one-hit pitching your first time out. The greatest goalkeeping this team ever faced.&quot; The Canadiens won both games on goals by Maurice Richard and a stellar performance by McNeil, who was dubbed by the Detroit press, &quot;the magician.&quot; When the Canadiens went on to eliminate the heavily-favored Red Wings, Detroit&#x27;s coach, Tommy Ivan, remarked, &quot;Gerry McNeil was the difference. He was terrific in their net.&quot; The 1951 Stanley Cup Finals remain the only best-of-seven series in which every game required overtime. Bill Barilko&#x27;s Cup-winning goal for the Toronto Maple Leafs against McNeil was famously captured in a photograph by Nat Turofsky, remaining part of the legend surrounding Barilko&#x27;s death.

McNeil recorded 10 shutouts in the 1952–53 season, making his play essential as the Canadiens only scored 155 goals in 70 games, a 2.21 goals per game rate. The last game of the regular season was against Detroit at the Olympia, and sitting at 49 goals, Gordie Howe was set to match and perhaps beat Richard&#x27;s then-record of 50 in a season, set when he had scored 50 goals in 50 games in 1943-44. Howe did not score on five shots against McNeil, who was heard telling Richard after the game, &quot;well Rock, he&#x27;ll have to start over at one again.&quot; McNeil&#x27;s Stanley Cup victory a few weeks later was immortalized in Wayne Johnston&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Divine Ryans&quot;. He won the Cup the night before his 27th birthday with a shutout in overtime.

In the 1954 Stanley Cup Finals McNeil suffered another overtime loss, this time in game seven when the puck was deflected past him by his teammate Doug Harvey. He retired that summer but returned to professional hockey a year later with the Montreal Royals. He then filled in for an asthmatic Jacques Plante at the beginning of the 1956-57 NHL season, before playing the rest of the season with the Royals. His name was engraved on the Stanley Cup for the 1957 Finals, and for the 1958 Finals because he was the team&#x27;s playoff spare goalie. After then played two seasons with the Rochester Americans in the AHL before finishing his professional career in his hometown with the Quebec Aces.

McNeil led the Montreal Canadiens to the Stanley Cup Finals all four seasons from 1950 to 1954, the seasons in which he was their number one goalie. This stretch was the first four of ten consecutive appearances in the Cup Finals for the Habs.

McNeil was known to play his best when it mattered most. He finished his NHL career with a 2.32 GAA for the regular season and a 1.89 in the playoffs. He appeared in three NHL All-Star games, (1951, 1952 and 1953) and posted a 2.00 GAA. His 28 regular season shutouts earned him an NHL Milestone Award in 1982.

==Personal life==
Born to Peter McNeil and Rose Dyotte (dit Gyotte) in 1926, McNeil was married to Theresa Conway (1927–2009) for 58 years, and the couple had four children, Shannon, Karen, David, and Donna, and six grandchildren. After retiring from hockey, McNeil worked as a sales representative for several organizations. His last position was regional sales manager for Thomas Adams, a Seagram&#x27;s company. He spent several winters in Panama City Beach, Florida with his hockey buddies: Elmer Lach, Ken Mosdell and Maurice Richard. He joined the first two as pallbearers at Richard&#x27;s funeral in May 2000 and died of cancer in 2004.

<text>Circuit de Monaco is a street circuit laid out on the city streets of Monte Carlo and La Condamine around the harbour of the Principality of Monaco. It is commonly, and even officially, referred to as &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; because it is largely inside the Monte Carlo neighbourhood of Monaco.

The circuit is annually used on three weekends in April–May for Formula One Monaco Grand Prix, Formula E Monaco ePrix and Historic Grand Prix of Monaco. Formula One&#x27;s respective feeder series over the years – Formula 3000, GP2 Series and today the Formula 2 and FIA Formula 3 championships and Porsche Supercup – also visit the circuit concurrently with Formula One. The Monaco Grand Prix is one of the three events victories in which count towards the Triple Crown of Motorsport.

==History==

The idea for a Grand Prix race around the streets of Monaco came from Antony Noghès, the president of the Monegasque motor club, Automobile Club de Monaco, and close friend of the ruling Grimaldi family. The inaugural race was held in 1929 and was won by William Grover-Williams in a Bugatti.

To date, only four local drivers have won a race at the circuit. Louis Chiron did it at the non-championship 1931 Monaco Grand Prix; 82 years later, Stefano Coletti crossed the line in first position at the sprint race of the 2013 Monaco GP2 Series round. The third driver to do so was Stéphane Richelmi at the sprint race of the 2014 Monaco GP2 Series round. The fourth was Charles Leclerc at the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix.

== Evolution of the circuit ==

The track has remained substantially unchanged since its creation in 1929: as a city circuit, its conformation is closely linked to that of the principality&#x27;s road system. The changes were almost entirely connected to redefinitions of the ordinary roads of the town.

In the first editions of the Grand Prix, the start and finish were placed on Boulevard Albert 1er (the innermost straight, which leads to the Sainte Dévote curve). In 1955 the start and finish were moved to the opposite straight, overlooking the promenade (that now houses the pit lane). At the time, neither the Piscine complex nor the &quot;La Rascasse&quot; hairpin existed: after the &quot;Tabac&quot; curve, the route proceeded in the lane that is parallel to today&#x27;s starting straight: the two sections (separated only by a row of trees) were joined by a single narrow hairpin called the &quot;Gasometer&quot;. As can be seen from the period films, in the second half of the 1950s the only existing lane after the Tabac was the one mentioned; in fact, in those years, the lane that we now call &quot;promenade&quot; with the two &quot;Piscine&quot; chicanes was not yet defined, and only in the 1960s images we can notice the progress of the landfilling about that portion of the bay, including the Piscine area which would be completed shortly thereafter.

In 1963 the starting line was moved back to Boulevard Albert 1er (opposite the promenade). The swimming pool and the waterfront lane that 10 years later would become part of the circuit had already been created, but at that point in time no changes were made to the track from the &quot;Tabac&quot; to the &quot;Gasometer&quot;.

In 1972 the boxes were moved near the &quot;Chicane&quot; area of the port, so the chicane was relocated closer to the &quot;Tabac&quot; curve. After this, the track continued on the usual straight (parallel to the starting lane) using the &quot;Gasometer&quot; curve for the last time. This solution lasted only a year and, in the following months, the main works were completed in time for the 1973 Grand Prix with the construction of a new section, connecting the &quot;Tabac&quot; curve to &quot;Piscine&quot; (Stade Nautique). This change added to the circuit – bringing its total length to  – adding the new portion along the harbour, which followed the layout of the swimming pool and ended in a new chicane around the &quot;La Rascasse&quot; restaurant and a slight climb to the &quot;Anthony Noghes Curve&quot; before rejoining the starting straight. The boxes were reinstalled in the old lane (now free). 1972 was also the last year for the passage through the old tunnel.

In 1973, as anticipated, the track was modified at various points also due to the construction of new civil buildings. In particular, a new hotel was under construction in the &quot;Old Station&quot; hairpin area (Hotel Loews, later renamed Fairmont), resulting in an extension of the tunnel towards the &quot;Portier&quot; curve. Images and videos from 1973 show the unusual passage under the new long tunnel, above which the pillars of the Loews hotel are being built. At the exit of the tunnel there was the traditional port chicane and, after the &quot;Tabac&quot; curve, the new path adjacent to the swimming pools (two &quot;S&quot; left–right and right–left connected by a short straight) and &quot;La Rascasse&quot; hairpin. It was the first year for the new garages in an independent lane, with an entrance just after &quot;La Rascasse&quot;, where an asphalt slide was installed to overcome the difference in level from the roadway.

In 1976 the &quot;Sainte Dévote&quot; and &quot;Anthony Noghes&quot; corners were modified: in order to slow down the transit of the cars, curbs and protections were repositioned.

In 1986, thanks to the expansion of the roadway implemented in the chicane area of the port, the chicane itself was modified and made slower: instead of the previously existing fast change of direction, deemed too dangerous, new curbs were installed to design a double turn at 90 degrees. It was then renamed &quot;Nouvelle Chicane&quot;.

In 1997 the first &quot;Piscine&quot; corner was modified: the shifting of the track edge protections improved the visibility for the drivers and allowed a higher speed. A year later (at the request of Pasquale Lattuneddu, chief operating officer of Formula One Management), the whole area of the paddock was surrounded with shatterproof fences, in order to reduce and better manage the people authorised to access them.

In 2003 the second &quot;Piscine&quot; curve underwent a treatment similar to that of the first curve, with the shifting of the barriers to improve visibility, while the arrangement of new temporary curbs went to slow down the passage of the cars. However, the most important novelty was the widening of the port lane: in this way the segment between &quot;Piscine&quot; and &quot;La Rascasse&quot; could be rectified, becoming faster and less demanding. The extra space also allowed for the installation of new grandstands and the expansion of the pit lane, which was also equipped with semi-permanent two-storey buildings (instead of the previous tiny prefabricated structures) to better accommodate the teams, the technicians and the material.

Before the 2007 season, the internal curb of the &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; hairpin was significantly lowered and widened, in order to allow the single-seaters to climb on it and eventually face the curve with a narrower trajectory.

Since the 2003 edition, the traffic divider at the &quot;Sainte Dévote&quot; curve has been removed in order to widen the track: the track design is now left to the curb only. This has meant, for safety reasons, an extension of the exit lane from the pits: in practice, once the &quot;proper&quot; pit lane has been left, the drivers must remain in the yellow line that &quot;cuts&quot; the &quot;Sainte Dévote&quot;.

The pit lane was further revised in 2004 by reversing the position of the pits with respect to the lane itself, building a much larger and more welcoming structure. Monaco has thus become the only Formula 1 circuit in which the pits are not facing the track, but rather physically separate it from the pit lane.

In 2011, after some accidents that occurred during the race weekend (the Mexican driver Sergio Pérez suffered a rather serious one), the drivers urged a change in the sector between the exit of the tunnel and the &quot;Nouvelle Chicane&quot;, complaining (above all) about the disconnection of the road surface and incorrect positioning of the guard rail in the escape route opposite the tunnel. However, these requests were not followed up.

In 2015 the &quot;Tabac&quot; curve was re-profiled, slightly anticipating the entrance and thus shortening the track by three metres (from to today).

==Characteristics==

The building of the circuit takes six weeks, and the dismantling after the race another three weeks. The race circuit is narrow, with many elevation shifts and tight corners. These features make it perhaps the most demanding track in Formula One racing. Although the course has changed many times during its history, it is still considered the ultimate test of driving skills in Formula One. It contains both the slowest corner in Formula One (the Fairmont Hairpin, taken at just ) and one of the quickest (the flat out kink in the tunnel, three turns beyond the hairpin, taken at ).

Due to the tight and twisty nature of the circuit, it favours the skill of the drivers over the power of the cars. However, there is very little overtaking as the course is so narrow and dangerous, as demonstrated by the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix having only one overtake in a 78 lap race (when Mick Schumacher overtook his teammate Nikita Mazepin on the opening lap). Nelson Piquet likened racing round the course to &quot;riding a bicycle around your living room&quot;. Prior to 1987, the number of cars starting the race was limited to 20, compared to 26 at other circuits. The famous tunnel section (running under the Fairmont Hotel, marked in grey in the circuit diagram above) is said to be difficult for drivers to cope with due to the quick switch from light to dark, then back to light again, at one of the fastest points of the course. As a result, race outcomes tend to be decided by grid positions as well as pit strategies, and the race is extremely hard on gearboxes and brakes.
Several attempts have been made to improve cramped conditions in the pit garages. In 2002, a substantial amount of land was reclaimed from the harbour to slightly change the shape of one section of the circuit; this left more space for new pit garages, which debuted in the 2004 event.

The circuit is generally recognized to be less safe than other circuits used for Formula One. Driver and former winner Michael Schumacher stated before the 2012 Grand Prix that the additional risk is &quot;justifiable once a year&quot;. If it were not already an existing Grand Prix, it would not be permitted to be added to the Formula One schedule, for safety reasons.

In January 2009, the circuit was voted top of the &quot;Seven Sporting Wonders of the World&quot; in a poll of 3,500 British sports fans.

===A lap of the modern-day circuit===
The lap starts with a short sprint up Boulevard Albert Ier, to the tight &quot;Sainte-Dévote&quot; corner, named after Sainte-Dévote Chapel, a small church just beyond the barriers. This is a nearly 90-degree right-hand bend usually taken in first or second gear. This corner has seen many first lap accidents, although these are less common since the removal of the mini roundabout on the apex of the corner before the 2003 event, making the entrance to the corner wider. The cars then head uphill along Avenue d&#x27;Ostende, before changing down for the long left-hander at &quot;Massenet&quot;. The maximum gradient in this part of the circuit is around 12%.

Out of Massenet, the cars drive past the famous casino, Monte Carlo Casino, before quickly reaching the aptly named &quot;Casino Square&quot;. This part of the track is higher than the lowest part. The cars snake down Avenue des Beaux Arts, the next short straight, avoiding an enormous bump on the left of the track, a reminder of the unique nature of the circuit. This leads to the tight &quot;Mirabeau&quot; corner, which is followed by a short downhill burst to the even tighter &quot;Fairmont Hairpin&quot; (was known as the &quot;Station Hairpin&quot; before the hotel was opened on the site in 1973; the hairpin&#x27;s name changed depending on the name on the hotel). It is a corner which has been used for many overtaking manoeuvres in the past. However, it would be almost physically impossible for two modern F1 cars to go round side by side, as the drivers must use full steering lock to get around. It is so tight that many Formula 1 teams must redesign their steering and suspension specifically to negotiate this corner.

After the hairpin, the cars head downhill again to a double right-hander called &quot;Portier,&quot; named after the region of Monaco, before heading into the famous tunnel, a unique feature of a Formula One circuit. (Until 2009 only one other circuit, Detroit in 1982–1988, featured a tunnel, but the F1 series now includes racing at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, which presents a shorter tunnel at the exit of the pit lane.) As well as the change of light making visibility poor, a car can lose 20–30% of its downforce due to the unique aerodynamic properties of the tunnel. The tunnel also presents a unique problem when it rains. As it is virtually indoors, the tunnel usually remains dry while the rest of the track is wet, with only the cars bringing in water from their tyres. Famously before the very wet 1984 race, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone had local fire crews wet down the road in the tunnel to give it the same surface grip as the rest of the track. This was done at the request of McLaren driver Niki Lauda.
Out of the tunnel, the cars have to brake hard for the tight left–right–left &quot;Nouvelle Chicane&quot;. This has been the scene of several large accidents, including that of Karl Wendlinger in 1994, Jenson Button in 2003 and Sergio Pérez in 2011. The chicane is generally the only place on the circuit where overtaking can be attempted. There is a short straight to &quot;Tabac&quot;, so called as there used to be a tobacconist on the outside of the corner. &quot;Tabac&quot; is a tight fourth-gear corner which is taken at about . Accelerating up to , the cars reach &quot;Piscine&quot;, a fast left–right followed by a slower right–left chicane which takes the cars past the Rainier III Nautical Stadium, its swimming pool gives its name to the corner.
Following &quot;Piscine&quot;, there is a short straight followed by heavy braking for a quick left which is immediately followed by the tight 135-degree right-hander called &quot;La Rascasse&quot;. This is another corner that requires full steering lock; it is remembered as the location of one of the most suspicious manoeuvres in recent Formula One history when Michael Schumacher appeared to deliberately stop his car during qualifying for the 2006 race so as to prevent Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber – who were both following and were on flying laps – from out-qualifying him. &quot;Rascasse&quot; takes the cars into a short straight that precedes the final corner, &quot;Virage Antony Noghès&quot;. Named after the organiser of the first Monaco Grand Prix, the corner is a tight right-hander which brings the cars back onto the start-finish straight, and across the line to start a new lap.

Monaco is one of the three circuits which have only one DRS zone, the others being Suzuka and Imola. During the race, it is active along the pit straight from Antony Noghès to Sainte-Dévote, for a total of .

===Mechanical adaptations===

Monaco&#x27;s street circuit places very different demands on the cars in comparison to the majority of the other circuits used during a Championship season. The cars are set up with high downforce; not as is popularly believed to increase cornering speeds, as many of the corners are taken at such a low speed to negate any aerodynamic effect, but instead to shorten braking times and keep the cars stable under acceleration. Many teams use special wing assemblies incorporating extra active planes in addition to those in use for other circuits. The Jordan and Arrows teams tried to use new mid-wings in 2001. The Arrows wing was similar in design to a normal rear wing but smaller and suspended above the nose cone. Jordan had a small wing suspended on a short pole just in front of the driver. Both were designed to improve downforce, but, after testing them during Thursday practice, the FIA banned both.

Brake wear is not a problem during a race in Monaco. Instead, the low speeds mean the issue is keeping the brakes up to working temperature. The only heavy braking points are at the chicane after the tunnel, and to a lesser extent into the &quot;Sainte-Dévote&quot; and &quot;Mirabeau&quot; corners. With a lack of temperature, brake bite becomes a problem, as the surface of the carbon brake disc becomes smooth as glass, reducing friction between the pads and the disk, hence lessening braking power. To combat this, in 2006 Juan Pablo Montoya adopted discs with radial grooves that increased the bite rate between disk and pads, increasing the average temperature of the brakes.

Conversely, cooling the cars&#x27; engines is a major concern. Formula One cars do not incorporate any form of forced cooling, relying solely on air moving over the car to remove heat from the radiator elements. In the past many teams used to adjust the radiator intakes to allow for extra airflow, creating the once-common &quot;Monaco nose&quot;. Before 2014, teams also used closer ratio gears, as there are hardly any long straights in Monaco and acceleration is at a premium (starting from the 2014 season, the same gear ratios must be used throughout the season). A special steering rack with a larger pinion gear is also fitted to allow the cars to be driven around the tightest corners.

==In other motorsport==
===FIA World Rally Championship===
The circuit has been used as a special stage during the WRC Monte Carlo Rally, for example in 2008.

===FIA Formula E Championship===

On 18 September 2014 it was announced the Formula E would be racing on a shorter version of the Monaco Grand Prix circuit, which was subsequently used for the 2014–15, 2016–17 and 2018–19 seasons. This layout omitted the regular section of the track between the climb up the hill at Beau Rivage and the Nouvelle Chicane at the exit of the tunnel, instead turning right immediately after Saint Devote to head downhill, before rejoining the regular layout by way of a 180 degree turn at the chicane.

Monaco was not scheduled to be on the calendar for the second season of Formula E because it took the slot on the calendar filled by the Historic Grand Prix at Monaco every other year. The inaugural Paris ePrix took its spot on the calendar for season two, with the Monaco ePrix reinstated for season three. This biennial agreement will continue at least into Formula E&#x27;s fifth season.

A new track layout was used only for the 2021 Monaco ePrix: the layout is similar to the Formula One layout, with only slight differences at turns 1 (Sainte Devote) and 11 (Nouvelle Chicane). This new layout has a length of ; the distance of the track being increased due to the increase in car performance and range of Gen2 cars. The 2022 Monaco ePrix would instead see the race run on the full track layout.

==Criticism==
Several commentators and drivers have criticised the circuit&#x27;s design, saying that it creates boring races. Criticism has been directed towards how few overtake attempts are performed, the slow speeds at which the cars take the &quot;Fairmont Hairpin&quot;, as well as how frequently the driver who sets the pole position wins. Fernando Alonso has said that the race is &quot;the most boring race ever&quot;, and Lewis Hamilton stated that the 2022 Grand Prix &quot;wasn&#x27;t really racing.&quot; There have been various ideas on how to give racers more opportunity to pass, and one of these is to extend the race track along the east side of Hercules harbor and add a second DRS zone.

==Layout history and lap records==

As of May 2024, the layout history and fastest official race lap records at the Circuit de Monaco are listed as:

==Weather==
The Monaco Grand Prix is run on the final Sunday of May, in a transition between spring and summer. Monaco, in general, has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;), although since the track is only used for a brief period in May, when it is being used it has a narrower temperature range than the principality itself has throughout the year. For the Monaco Grand Prix, temperatures are usually around in terms of ambient conditions, whereas sun exposure can make the track itself a bit warmer than that. Still, soft tyre compounds often tend to hold up well around Monaco courtesy of surface temperatures being fairly moderate. The maritime moderation make May heatwaves rather unlikely.

Although the Mediterranean precipitation pattern leads to Monaco being quite dry by late May, due to the urban and narrow nature of the circuit, rainfall combined with the painted areas and the long tunnel makes wet racing extremely challenging. This was demonstrated by the 1984, 1996, 1997, 2008, 2016, 2022 and 2023 events. The 1984 event was red-flagged due to track conditions being deemed too dangerous with the race not being restarted. In 1996, the mixed-weather conditions caused carnage, paving way for Olivier Panis&#x27; shock win in an unfancied Ligier. The following year, the 1997 race winner Michael Schumacher got the chequered flag after just 62 of the planned 78 laps due to the very slow pace of half a minute slower than dry-weather lap times on the very wet track seeing the clock hit the two hours of maximum time well before the race distance was completed.

The tunnel can be sprinkled under wet conditions to provide for consistent track conditions, although during a full-wet race the tunnel gets drier throughout.

<text>Güyük Khan or Güyüg Khagan, mononymously Güyüg ( 19 March 1206 – 20 April 1248), was the third Khagan of the Mongol Empire, the eldest son of Ögedei Khan and a grandson of Genghis Khan. He reigned from 1246 to 1248. He started his military career by participating in the conquest of Eastern Xia in China and later in the invasion of Europe. When his father died, he was enthroned as Khagan in 1246. During his almost two year reign, he reversed some of his mother&#x27;s unpopular edicts and ordered an empire-wide census; he also held some authority in Eastern Europe, appointing Andrey II as the grand prince of Vladimir and giving the princely title of Kiev to Alexander Nevsky.

==Appearance==

According to Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, Güyük was of &quot;medium stature, very prudent and extremely shrewd, and serious and sedate in his manners.&quot;

==Early life==

Güyük received military training and served as an officer under his grandfather Genghis Khan and later his father Ögedei Khan (after the death of Genghis in 1227). He married Oghul Qaimish of the Merkit clan. In 1233, Güyük, along with his maternal cousin Alchidai and the Mongol general Tangghud, conquered the short-lived Dongxia Kingdom of Puxian Wannu, who was a rebellious Jin official, in a few months. After the death of Güyük&#x27;s uncle Tolui, Ögedei proposed that Sorghaghtani, the widow of Tolui, marry his son Güyük. Sorghaghtani declined, saying that her prime responsibility was to her own sons. According to Ata-Malik Juvayni, Güyük, son of Ögedei, was a Christian, but does not specify of what denomination.

Güyük participated in the invasion of Eastern and Central Europe in 1236–1241 with other Mongol princes, including his cousin Batu and half-brother Kadan. He led his corps in the Siege of Ryazan and the lengthy siege of the Alanian capital Maghas. During the course of the conquest, Güyük quarreled violently with Batu at the victory banquet and screamed at him, &quot;Batu is just an old woman with a quiver&quot;. Güyük and Büri, a grandson of Chagatai, stormed out of the banquet and rode away swearing and cursing. When word reached the Great Khan, they were recalled for a time to Mongolia. Ögedei refused to see them and threatened to have his son Güyük executed. Ögedei calmed down and finally admitted Güyük into his ger. Ögedei criticized Güyük, &quot;Do you think that the Russians surrendered because how mean you were to your own men. ... because you captured one or two warriors, you think that you won the war. But you didn&#x27;t capture even a single kid goat.&quot; Ögedei reprimanded his son harshly for fighting within the family and for mistreating his soldiers. Güyük was dispatched again to Europe.

In the meantime, Ögedei had died (in 1241), and his widow Töregene had taken over as regent, a position of great influence and authority that she used to advocate for her son Güyük. Batu withdrew from Europe so that he might have some influence over the succession, but despite his delaying tactics, Töregene succeeded in getting Güyük elected Khan in 1246. When Genghis Khan&#x27;s youngest brother, Temüge, threatened the Great Khatun Toregene in an attempt to seize the throne, Güyük came to Mongolia from Emil to secure his position immediately.

==Enthronement (1246)==

Güyük&#x27;s enthronement on 24 August 1246, near the Mongol capital at Karakorum, was attended by a large number of foreign ambassadors: the Franciscan friar and envoy of Pope Innocent IV, John of Plano Carpini and Benedict of Poland; Grand Duke Yaroslav II of Vladimir; the incumbents for the throne of Georgia, David VI and David VII; the brother of the king of Armenia and historian, Sempad the Constable; the future Seljuk Sultan of Rum, Kilij Arslan IV; and ambassadors of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Musta&#x27;sim and Ala ud din Masud of the Delhi Sultanate. According to John of Plano Carpini, Güyük&#x27;s formal election in a great &quot;kurultai&quot;, or diet of the tribes, took place while his company was at a camp called &quot;Sira Orda&quot;, or &quot;Yellow Pavilion,&quot; along with 3,000 to 4,000 visitors from all parts of Asia and eastern Europe, bearing homage, tribute, and presents. They afterwards witnessed the formal enthronement at another camp in the vicinity called the &quot;Golden Ordu,&quot; after which they were presented to the emperor. Mosul submitted to him, sending envoys to that assembly. According to the 13th century historian Juvayni:

When the papal envoy John of Plano Carpini protested Mongol attacks on the Catholic kingdoms of Europe, Güyük stated that these people had slain Mongol envoys in the time of Genghis Khan and Ogedei Khan. He also claimed that &quot;from the rising of the sun to its setting, all the lands have been made subject to the Great Khan&quot;, proclaiming an explicit ideology of world conquest. The Khagan wrote a letter to Pope Innocent IV on the relations between the Church and the Mongols. &quot;You must say with a sincere heart: &#x27;We will be your subjects; we will give you our strength&#x27;. You must in person come with your kings, all together, without exception, to render us service and pay us homage. Only then will we acknowledge your submission. And if you do not follow the order of God, and go against our orders, we will know you as our enemy.&quot;

By this time, the relationship between Güyük and Toregene had deteriorated significantly, despite Toregene&#x27;s role in Güyük&#x27;s accession. Against Toregene&#x27;s wishes, Güyük had Toregene&#x27;s favorite, Fatima, arrested, tortured and executed for bewitching his brother Koden (Khuden), and Abd-ur-Rahman was also beheaded for corruption. Of the provincial officials appointed under Toregene, only the Oirat official Arghun Aqa remained. Toregene herself died later, possibly at Güyük&#x27;s orders. Güyük had Temüge&#x27;s case investigated by Orda Khan and Möngke, and they had him executed. Güyük replaced the child khan Qara Hülëgü of the Chagatai Khanate with his favorite cousin Yesü Möngke to secure his position. He also restored his father&#x27;s officials, Mahmud Yalavach, Masud Beg and Chinqai to positions in the provinces.

==Reign (1246–1248)==

Güyük reversed several unpopular edicts of his mother the regent and made a surprisingly capable khan, appointing Eljigidei in Persia in preparation for an attack on Baghdad and the Ismailis and pursuing the war against the Song Dynasty. He was, nevertheless, insecure and won the disapproval of his subjects by executing several high-ranking officials of the previous regime for treason. The Seljuk princes struggled incessantly for the throne of the Sultanate of Rum. Despised by Izz-ad-Din, Rukn ad-Din Kilij Arslan IV came to Mongolia. Güyük ordered Rukn ad-Din enthroned in Izz-ad-Din Kaykaus II&#x27;s place. A darughachi with 2,000 Mongol troops was sent to enforce this decision. When both David Narin and David Ulu summoned before Güyük in Karakorum, he made David Ulu the senior king and divided the Kingdom of Georgia between them. After the treaty signed by the Mongols and the Cilician Armenia in 1243, the king Hetoum I sent his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in Karakorum and made a formal agreement in 1247 in which Cilician Armenia would be considered a vassal state of the Mongol Empire. Due to Armenia&#x27;s voluntary surrender, Sempad received a Mongol wife, and his kingdom was spared Mongol overseers and tax. Güyük demanded full submission of the Abbasids and the Ismailis. Güyük Khan blamed Baiju for the irritated resistance of the Abbasid Caliphate.

Güyük ordered an empire-wide census. In 1246, by the decree of Güyük, taxes amounting between to of value were imposed on everything and a heavy head tax of 60 silver drams was collected from males in Georgia and Armenia. The Great Khan separated the position of the great darughachi from that of chief scribe. Güyük took half of his father&#x27;s kheshig for himself. Under his rule, the Uyghur officials increased their dominance, sidelining the North Chinese and the Muslims. Güyük was a strict and intelligent person, though rather morose and sickly, and his bad drinking habit worsened his health.

Güyük sent Amuqan to Korea and the Mongols camped near Yiom-ju in July 1247. After the king Gojong of Goryeo refused to move his capital from Ganghwa Island to Songdo, Amuqan&#x27;s force pillaged the Korean Peninsula until 1250.

Although Batu did not support Güyük&#x27;s election, he respected the Great Khan as a traditionalist and sent Andrey and Alexander Nevsky to Karakorum in Mongolia in 1247 after their father&#x27;s death. Güyük appointed Andrey as the grand prince of Vladimir and gave Alexander the princely title of Kiev. In 1248, he demanded Batu come towards Mongolia to meet him, a move that some contemporaries regarded as a pretext for Batu&#x27;s arrest. In compliance with the order, Batu approached bringing a large army. When Güyük moved westwards, Sorghaghtani warned Batu that the Jochids might be his target.

Güyük died en route, in modern-day Qinghe County, Xinjiang, China. Güyük might have been poisoned, but some modern historians believe that he died of natural causes because his health deteriorated. According to William of Rubruck he was killed in a violent brawl with Shiban. His widow Oghul Qaimish took over as regent, but she would be unable to keep the succession within her branch of the family. Möngke succeeded as Khan in 1251.

==Wives, concubines, and children==

It was common for powerful Mongol men to have many wives and concubines, but it is unknown how many wives or concubines Güyük had.

*Primary Consort Wuwuerheimishi (元妃烏兀儿黑迷失), of the Merkit tribe (蔑兒乞氏)
*Empress Naimanzhen (乃蠻真皇后), of the Namaizhen tribe (乃蠻真氏)
*Empress Qinshu (欽淑皇后, d.1251), of the Merkit tribe (蔑兒乞氏)
**Khoja (忽察), first son
**Naqu (腦忽), second son
*Unknown wife or concubine:
**Khokhoo, third son
**Babahaer (公主 巴巴哈爾), first daughter
**Yelimishi (趙國公主 葉里迷失), second daughter
***married Junbuhua (君不花) and had issues (three sons)

==Legacy==
The death of Güyük had a profound effect on world history. Güyük wanted to turn the Mongol power against Europe, but his premature death prevented Mongol forces from trying to move further west into Europe. Subsequent to Güyük&#x27;s death, Mongol family politics caused the Mongol efforts to be instead directed against southern China, which was eventually conquered during the rule of Kublai Khan.

When Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty in 1271, he had Güyük Khan placed on the official record as Dingzong ().

<text>NTN Buzztime is a company that produces interactive entertainment across many different platforms. Its most well-known product, simply called Buzztime, and formerly known as the NTN Network, since 1985, broadcasts trivia and other games via broadband over a national network to over 3,800 bars and restaurants in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Operations in the UK were discontinued in 2008. Typically, independently owned bars and restaurants offer Buzztime. It is, however, offered by each outlet of two major U.S. chains, Buffalo Wild Wings and Damon&#x27;s Grill. As of August 2021, Buffalo Wild Wings only carries Buzztime in 7 U.S. locations in 5 different states. It is also carried at limited T.G.I. Friday&#x27;s and Applebee&#x27;s locations. Buzztime offers several different kinds of trivia games based on a variety of subjects, including pop culture, entertainment, world history, geography, sports and music, as well as general trivia games with questions in many categories.

NTN Buzztime, Inc. is based in Carlsbad, California. The company was founded as Alroy Industries and formerly went by the name NTN Communications, Inc. from 1985 to 2005.

==Other products==
In 1988, NTN Buzztime began outfitting Kentucky school districts with interactive keypads, in cooperation with Kentucky Educational Television, as a part of a new satellite program delivery program, eventually taking form as the KET Star Channels. The use of the technology itself being inspired by Buzztime technology being used in a Lexington bar as part of a football play prediction game. The first Star Channels course, on statistics and probability, was taught in January 1989 to 24 Kentucky high schools and another 41 high schools in 16 states. The program was then rolled out statewide in the wake of the Kentucky Supreme Court finding the state&#x27;s education system unconstitutional. Star Channels attracted international attention, including delegations from China and Kuwait.

NTN Buzztime also used to produce a variety of wireless paging products, the most common example being a device that vibrates when a food order is ready. The wireless product division was sold in 2006.

NTN Buzztime also once produced and distributed ProHost Seating and Reservations Software for managing door and floor operations in Restaurants, Casinos, Theme Parks, Hotels, in its Arlington, TX office- known as &quot;Software Solutions&quot;. Signature customers include Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment, MGM Mirage, Universal Studios and Hard Rock Cafe. The software solutions division was sold by NTN Buzztime, Inc. in 2007 to ESP Digital Media.

==Lawsuits==
In 1997, a complaint was filed charging NTN for devising an &quot;exit strategy&quot; that would provide certain defendants with millions of dollars of compensation upon their resignation. In 2000, a settlement of $3,250,000 was approved.

In January 2008, the company filed a legal suit, in the Southern District of California against Sony Computer Entertainment, alleging that Sony had violated several of its trademarks. The suit accused Sony of a &quot;malicious, fraudulent, knowing, wilful, and deliberate&quot; violation of its trademarks. In the suit, Buzztime sought the recall and destruction of all infringing products and asked the court for actual damages, punitive damages, legal fees and an order to the US Patent and Trademark Office not to register Sony&#x27;s then pending &quot;Buzz!&quot; trademarks. The case was eventually settled out of court in favor of Sony.

<doc id="742597" wikidata="Q16148703" url="?curid=742597" title="Access for Afghan Women Act">
<text>The Access for Afghan Women Act of 2003 () is a bill introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Representatives Carolyn Maloney (Democrat, New York) and Dana Rohrabacher (Republican, California). The bill was submitted on March 27, 2003, to the House of Representatives and was immediately referred to the House Committee on International Relations.

== Human rights for Afghan women and girls ==

=== Lead ===
The bill was introduced due to concerns that women remained marginalized in the re-development of Afghanistan. Additionally, in the early 2000s the circumstances of women in Afghanistan remained precarious despite the overthrow of the Taliban regime during the United States-led Afghanistan campaign (U.S. invasion of Afghanistan). The bill addresses assistance for Afghan women and girls in regards to political and human rights, health care, education, training, security, and shelter.

The bill seeks to secure improved circumstances and promote opportunities for women by incorporating them within the reconstruction and on-going development efforts being undertaken in Afghanistan.

The bill attempts to secure these by appropriating funding, establishing aid allocation requirements, defining objectives of United States international policy in Afghanistan, and setting standards of behavior for the United States in executing policy.

=== Article Body ===
From 1996, the Taliban enforced a very strict set of laws known as Sharia, that ultimately isolated women from society. These same laws banned any sort of entertainment such as television or books. After the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, the United States increasingly started taking control. The events that occurred on 9/11 resulted in U.S involvement in Afghanistan, against the Taliban. The establishment of the Access for Afghan Women Act of 2003 was and continues to be an effort to protect Afghan women and girls from continuing to be oppressed.

Ever since the Taliban took power, young women and girls have been deprived of education in Afghanistan. While the basis of the Access for Afghan Women Act is to provide Afghan women with access to basic human rights such as security, health care, and education, it is also a way to figure out how to educate those who have not had the privilege of having an education for such a long period of time.

=== Current status ===
The &quot;Access for Afghan Women Act,&quot; initially introduced to bolster the rights and freedoms of Afghan women, faces significant hurdles in its implementation. With the Taliban&#x27;s return, there have been widespread concerns about the rollback of women&#x27;s rights, affecting the Act&#x27;s core objectives. Reports from UN Women outlets suggest a marked decrease in women&#x27;s participation in education and the workforce, directly contravening the Act&#x27;s goals. Furthermore, the international community&#x27;s engagement in Afghanistan has become more complex, impacting the funding and support essential for the Act&#x27;s initiatives.

=== Challenges ===

==== Political Instability ====
The resurgence of the Taliban regime has drastically altered the political environment, making it increasingly difficult to enforce the Act&#x27;s provisions. The Taliban&#x27;s historical stance on women&#x27;s rights, particularly their restrictions on education, employment, and freedom of movement, directly conflicts with the Act&#x27;s objectives. This political shift poses a substantial challenge to advancing women&#x27;s rights and maintaining the gains made in the past two decades.

==== Cultural and social Barriers ====
Cultural norms and societal attitudes towards women&#x27;s roles in Afghanistan continue to be significant barriers. Despite legislative efforts, deeply ingrained beliefs and practices often impede the practical application of laws designed to protect and empower women. This cultural resistance necessitates not only legal but also social and educational interventions, which are challenging to implement, especially under a regime that may not support such changes.

==== International Support and Funding ====
The effectiveness of the Act is heavily reliant on international support and funding, which have become uncertain in the current geopolitical climate. With the withdrawal of U.S. troops and reduced international presence, there is a risk of diminished focus and resources dedicated to women&#x27;s issues in Afghanistan. Ensuring continued support and funding is crucial for the Act&#x27;s initiatives, yet it is increasingly challenging in the face of shifting global priorities and aid fatigue.

=== Conclusion ===
Overall, the bill attempts to secure human rights for Afghan women by appropriating funding, establishing aid allocation requirements, defining objectives of United States international policy in Afghanistan, and setting standards of behavior for the United States in executing policy.

<text>Aaron Montgomery Ward (February 17, 1843 – December 7, 1913) was an American entrepreneur based in Chicago who made his fortune through the use of mail order for retail sales of general merchandise to rural customers. In 1872 he founded Montgomery Ward &amp; Company, which became nationally known.

Ward, a young traveling salesman of dry goods, was concerned over the plight of many rural Midwest Americans who were, he thought, being overcharged and under-served by many of the small town retailers on whom they had to rely for their general merchandise. He opened his first mail-order house in 1872. By heavy use of the railroads centered on Chicago, and by associating his business with the non-profit Patrons of Husbandry (the Grangers), Ward offered rural customers a far larger stock than generally available in small towns and at a lower price. Unlike local country merchants, Ward offered no bargaining and no credit. His free catalog, printed by the most modern methods, was widely mailed to customers, allowing them to see pictures of consumer goods and imagine how they might be used. Later, Ward used the Post Office&#x27;s Rural Free Delivery service; he lobbied for a parcel post system that came about in 1906. The early 20th century was the heyday of mail orders and Ward&#x27;s had become an American tradition, along with its rival Sears Roebuck.

Ward continues to be honored as the protector of Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois.

==Early years==
Aaron Montgomery Ward was born on February 17, 1843 in Chatham, New Jersey. to a large family with a modest income. When he was about 9 years old, his father Sylvester Ward moved the family to Niles, Michigan, where Montgomery attended public schools. When Montgomery was 14, he was apprenticed to a trade to help support the family. According to his brief memoirs, he first earned 25 cents per day at a cutting machine in a barrel stave factory and then stacking brick in a kiln at 30 cents a day.

Energy and ambition drove Ward to seek employment in the town of St. Joseph, Michigan, where he went to work in a shoe store. This was a market town for a farm area devoted to fruit orchards. Starting in sales eventually led him to the profession that made him famous. Being a fair salesman, within nine months he was engaged as a salesman in a general country store at $6/month plus board, a considerable salary at the time. He rose to become head clerk and general manager of the store, and worked there for three years. By the end of that time, his salary was $100/month plus his board. He left for a better job in a competing store, where he worked another two years. In this period, Ward learned retailing.

==Field Palmer and later years==
In 1865, Ward relocated to Chicago, where he worked for Case and Sobin, a lamp house. He traveled for them as salesman, and sold goods on commission for a short time. Chicago was the center of the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the 1860s Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer &amp; Leiter, forerunner of Marshall Field &amp; Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg &amp; Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores and listening to the complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. It was a time when rural consumers longed for the comforts of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the country. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their markups and commissions, and drastically cutting selling costs, he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices. He invited them to send their orders by mail and he delivered the purchases to their nearest railroad station. The only thing he lacked was capital.

==Montgomery Ward mail-order catalog==
None of Ward&#x27;s friends or business acquaintances joined in his enthusiasm for his revolutionary idea. Although his idea was generally considered to border on lunacy and his first inventory was destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire, Ward persevered. In August 1872, with two fellow employees and a total capital of $1,600 he formed Montgomery Ward &amp; Company. He rented a small shipping room on North Clark Street and published a general merchandise mail-order catalog with 163 products listed. It is said that in 1880, Aaron Montgomery Ward initially wrote all catalog copy. When the business grew and department heads wrote merchandise descriptions, he still went over every line of copy to be certain that it was accurate.

The following year, both of Ward&#x27;s partners left him, but he hung on. Later, George Robinson Thorne, his future brother-in-law, joined him in his business. This was the turning point for the young company, which grew and prospered. Soon the catalog, frequently reviled and even burned publicly by rural retailers, became known fondly as the &quot;Wish Book.&quot; It was a favorite in households all across America.

Ward&#x27;s catalog soon was copied by other enterprising merchants, most notably Richard Warren Sears, who mailed his first general catalog in 1896. Others entered the field, and by 1971 catalog sales of major U.S. firms exceeded $250 million in postal revenue. Although the Sears Tower in Chicago is famous for once being the United States&#x27; tallest building, Montgomery Ward&#x27;s headquarters once held that distinction. The Montgomery Ward Tower, on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Madison Street in Chicago, reigned as a major tourist attraction in the early-1900s.

==Public life: the fight for Grant Park==
In civic life in Chicago, Ward fought for the poor people&#x27;s access to Chicago&#x27;s lakefront. In 1906 he campaigned to preserve Grant Park as a public park. Grant Park has been protected since 1836 by &quot;forever open, clear and free&quot; legislation that has been affirmed by four Illinois Supreme Court rulings. Ward twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones. Ward is known by some as the &quot;watch dog of the lake front&quot; for his preservationist efforts. As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park. However, &quot;Crown Fountain&quot; and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion were exempt from the height restriction because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures. Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 1909 Burnham Plan eventually preserved Grant Park and the entire Chicago lakefront.

==Legacy==
Montgomery Ward died in Highland Park on December 7, 1913, aged 70, and was interred at Rosehill Mausoleum in Rosehill Cemetery. His wife Elizabeth bequeathed a large portion of the estate to Northwestern University and other educational institutions.

The Montgomery Ward catalog&#x27;s place in history was acknowledged when the Grolier Club, a society of bibliophiles in New York, exhibited it in 1946 alongside &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; as one of the 100 books with the most influence on life and culture of the American people.

A bronze bust honoring Ward and seven other industry magnates stands between the Chicago River and the Merchandise Mart in downtown Chicago, Illinois. A smaller version of that bust is located in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park.

In 2010, the Chicago Park District Board of Commissioners renamed Erie park in honor of A. Montgomery Ward. It is located at 630 N. Kingsbury Street, a few blocks away from the old Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. Catalog House Building at 600 W. Chicago Avenue.

In 2005, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine readers and editors ranked Aaron Montgomery Ward as the 16th-most influential businessman of all time.

Despite the collapse of its catalog business and brick and mortar department stores in 2001, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.&#x27;s reincarnation as an online retailer still adheres to the once unheard-of philosophy of &quot;satisfaction guaranteed&quot;, although it is not the same company.

<text>Montgomery Ward is the name of two successive U.S. retail corporations. The original Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. was a mail-order business and later a department store chain that operated between 1872 and 2001. The current Montgomery Ward Inc. is an online shopping and mail-order catalog retailer that started several years after the original Montgomery Ward shut down.

==Original Montgomery Ward (1872–2001)==
===Company origins===
Aaron Montgomery Ward started his business in Chicago; conflicting reports place his first office either in a single room at 825 North Clark Street or in a loft above a livery stable on Kinzie Street, between Rush and State Streets.

In 1883, the company&#x27;s catalog had grown to 240 pages and 10,000 items. In 1896, Ward encountered its first serious competition in the mail order business, when Richard Warren Sears introduced his first general catalog. In 1900, Ward had total sales of $8.7 million, compared to $10 million for Sears, and both companies vied for dominance during much of the 20th century. By 1904, Ward had expanded such that it mailed three million catalogs, weighing each, to customers.

In 1908, the company opened a building stretching along nearly one-quarter mile of the Chicago River, north of downtown Chicago. The building, known as the Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. Catalog House, served as the company headquarters until 1974, when the offices moved across the street to a new tower designed by Minoru Yamasaki. The catalog house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978 and a Chicago historic landmark in May 2000. 

In the decades before 1930, Montgomery Ward built a network of large distribution centers across the country in Baltimore, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Oakland, Portland, and St. Paul. In most cases, these reinforced concrete structures were the largest industrial structures in their respective locations. The Baltimore Montgomery Ward Warehouse and Retail Store was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

===Expansion into retail outlets===
In 1926, the company broke with its mail-order-only tradition when it opened its first retail outlet store in Plymouth, Indiana. It continued to operate its catalog business while pursuing an aggressive campaign to build retail outlets in the late 1920s. In 1928, two years after opening its first outlet, it had opened 244 stores. By 1929, it had more than doubled its number of outlets to 531. Its flagship retail store in Chicago was located on Michigan Avenue between Madison and Washington streets.

In 1930, the company declined a merger offer from rival chain Sears. Losing money during the Great Depression, Ward alarmed its major investors, including J. P. Morgan, Jr. In 1931, Morgan hired a new president, Sewell Avery, who cut staff levels and stores, changed lines, hired store rather than catalog managers, and refurbished stores. These actions caused the company to become profitable before the end of the 1930s.

Ward was very successful in its retail business. &quot;Green awning&quot; stores dotted hundreds of small towns across the country. Larger stores were built in the major cities. By the end of the 1930s, Montgomery Ward had become the country&#x27;s largest retailer, and Sewell Avery became the company&#x27;s chief executive officer.

===Government seizure===
In April 1944, four months into a nationwide strike by the company&#x27;s 12,000 workers, U.S. Army troops seized the company&#x27;s Chicago offices. The action was ordered due to Avery&#x27;s refusal to settle the strike as requested by the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, concerned about the adverse effect on the delivery of goods in wartime. 

Avery had refused to comply with a War Labor Board order to recognize the unions and institute the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. Eight months later, with Montgomery Ward continuing to refuse to recognize the unions, President Roosevelt issued an executive order seizing all of Montgomery Ward&#x27;s property nationwide, citing the War Labor Disputes Act as well as his power under the Constitution as commander-in-chief. In 1945, President Harry S. Truman ended the seizure and the Supreme Court dismissed the pending appeal as moot.

===Post War===


After World War II, Sewell Avery believed the country would fall back into a recession or even a depression. He decided to not open any new stores, and did not even permit expenditure for paint to freshen the existing stores. His plan was to bank profits to preserve liquidity when the recession or depression he anticipated hit, and then buy up his retail competition. 

Without new stores or any investment back into the business, Montgomery Ward declined in sales volume compared to Sears. Many have blamed the conservative decisions of Avery, who seemed not to understand the postwar years&#x27; changing economy. As new shopping centers were built after the war, Sears was perceived to have better locations than Ward. Nonetheless, for many years Ward was still the nation&#x27;s third-largest department store chain.

In 1955, investor Louis Wolfson waged a high-profile proxy fight to obtain control of the board of Montgomery Ward. The new board forced the resignation of Avery. This fight led to a state court decision that Illinois corporations were not entitled to stagger elections of board members.&quot;

In 1961, company president John Barr hired Robert Elton Brooker to lead Montgomery Ward as president in its turnaround. Brooker brought with him a number of key new management people, including Edward Donnell, former manager of Sears&#x27; Los Angeles stores. 

The new management team achieved the turnaround reducing the number of suppliers from 15,000 to 7,000 and the number of brands being carried dropped from 168 to 16. Ward&#x27;s private brands were given 95 percent of the volume compared with 40 percent in 1960. 

The results of these changes were lower handling costs and higher quality standards. Buying was centralized but store operations were decentralized, under a new territory system modeled after Sears. 

In 1966, Ed Donnell was named company president. Brooker continued as chairman and chief executive officer until 1976. In 1968, Brooker helped engineer a friendly merger with Container Corporation of America, the new parent company being named MARCOR.

Despite the merger, the company continued to struggle into the 1970s. In 1973, its 102nd year in business, it purchased a small discount store chain, the Miami-based Jefferson Stores, renaming these locations Jefferson Ward. Mobil, flush with cash from the recent rise in oil prices and looking to diversify, bought a controlling share of MARCOR in 1974, only to acquire the company outright in 1976.

The company was an early entrant in the home computer market with the CyberVision 2001 in 1978, developed by the Authorship Resource, Inc., of Franklin, Ohio, and primarily manufactured by United Chem-Con. However, mounting competition from other computer companies as well as manufacturing problems compelled the three companies to pull the plug on the CyberVision product by the early 1980s.

By 1980, Mobil realized that the Montgomery Ward stores were doing poorly in comparison to the Jefferson stores, and decided that high quality discount units, along the lines of Dayton Hudson Company&#x27;s Target stores, would be the retailer&#x27;s future. 

Within 18 months, management quintupled the size of the operation, now called Jefferson Ward, to more than 40 units in the Delaware Valley and Richmond metropolitan areas, and planned to convert one-third of Montgomery Ward&#x27;s existing stores to the Jefferson Ward model. 

The burden of servicing the new stores fell to the tiny Jefferson staff, who were overwhelmed by the increased store count, had no experience in dealing with some of the product lines they now carried, and were unfamiliar with buying for northern markets.

Almost immediately, Jefferson had turned from a small moneymaker into a large drain on profits. The company sold the chain&#x27;s 18-store northern division to Bradlees, a division of Stop &amp; Shop, in 1985. The remaining stores closed.

In 1985, the company closed its catalog business after 113 years and began an aggressive policy of renovating its remaining stores. It restructured many of the store layouts in the downtown areas of larger cities and affluent neighborhoods into boutique-like specialty stores, as these were drawing business from traditional department stores. In 1986, fellow MARCOR firm, Container Corporation of America, was divested by Mobil. This effectively dissolved the MARCOR division and left Montgomery Ward as a direct subsidiary of Mobil. Analysts saw the CCA sale as an effort to go back on their diversification efforts, as the debts incurred since MARCOR’s acquisition began to weigh the oil giant down, and many predicted Montgomery Ward was next to be sold. These theories were confirmed in January 1987, when Mobil stated they would be looking into spinning off the company in the near future.

In March 1988, the company management undertook a successful $3.8 billion (~$ in ) leveraged buyout, making Montgomery Ward a privately held company.

===Bankruptcy, restructuring, and liquidation===
By the 1990s even its rivals began to lose ground to low-price competition from the likes of Target and Walmart, which eroded even more of Montgomery Ward&#x27;s traditional customer base. In 1997, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, emerging from protection by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois in August 1999 as a wholly owned subsidiary of GE Capital, which was by then its largest shareholder. 

As part of a last-ditch effort to remain competitive, the company closed over 100 retail locations in 30 U.S. states, abandoned the specialty store strategy, rebranded the chain as simply Wards, and spent millions of dollars to renovate its remaining outlets to be flashier and more consumer-friendly. GE Capital reneged on promises of further financial support of Montgomery Ward&#x27;s restructuring plans.

On December 28, 2000, after lower-than-expected sales during the Christmas season, the company announced it would cease operating, close its remaining 250 retail outlets, and lay off its 37,000 employees.

==As online retailer==
At its height, the original Montgomery Ward was one of the biggest retailers in the United States. After its demise, the familiarity of its brand meant its name, corporate logo, and advertising were considered valuable intangible assets. In 2004, catalog marketer Direct Marketing Services Inc. (DMSI), an Iowa direct marketing company, purchased much of the intellectual property assets of the former Wards, including the &quot;Montgomery Ward&quot; and &quot;Wards&quot; trademarks, for an undisclosed amount.

DMSI applied the brand to a new online and catalog-based retailing operation, with no physical stores, headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. DMSI then began operating under the Montgomery Ward branding in June 2004, selling many of the same kinds of products as the original company. The new company does not honor its predecessor&#x27;s obligations, such as gift cards and items sold with a lifetime guarantee. David Milgrom, then president of the DMSI-owned firm, told the Associated Press, &quot;We&#x27;re rebuilding the brand, and we want to do it right.&quot;

Four years later, in July 2008, DMSI announced it was on the auction block, with the sale of its assets scheduled for the following month. On August 5, 2008, the catalog retailer Swiss Colony purchased DMSI. Swiss Colony—which changed its name to Colony Brands Inc. June 1, 2010—kept Montgomery Ward alive and relaunched the Wards website September 10, 2008, with new catalogs mailing in February 2009. A month before the catalog&#x27;s launch, Swiss Colony President John Baumann told United Press International the retailer might also resurrect the original Montgomery Ward&#x27;s Signature and Powr-Kraft store brands. Among the new store brands Wards started under Colony was a home and kitchen brand called Chef Tested. By 2020, some Chef Tested and Montgomery Ward–brand home and kitchen items were being sold on Amazon.com.

<doc id="742605" wikidata="Q7521" url="?curid=742605" title="Möngke Khan">
<text>Möngke Khan (also Möngke Khagan or Möngke; 11 January 120911 August 1259) was the fourth khagan of the Mongol Empire, ruling from 1 July 1251 to 11 August 1259. He was the first Khagan from the Toluid line, and made significant reforms to improve the administration of the Empire during his reign. Under Möngke, the Mongols conquered Iraq and Syria as well as the kingdom of Dali (modern Yunnan).

==Early life==
Möngke was born on 11 January 1209, as the eldest son of Genghis Khan&#x27;s teenaged son Tolui and Sorghaghtani Beki. Teb Tengri Khokhcuu, a shaman, claimed to have seen in the stars a great future for the child and bestowed on him the name Möngke, meaning &#x27;eternal&#x27; in Mongolian. His uncle Ögedei Khan&#x27;s childless queen Angqui raised him at her orda (nomadic palace). Ögedei instructed Persian scholar Idi-dan Muhammed to teach writing to Möngke.

On his way back home after the Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia, Genghis Khan performed a ceremony on his grandsons Möngke and Kublai after their first hunting in 1224 near the Ili River. Möngke was fifteen years old, and with his brother, Kublai, killed a rabbit and an antelope. Their grandfather smeared fat from the killed animals onto their middle fingers following the Mongol tradition.

In 1230, Möngke went to war for the first time, following Ögedei and his father Tolui into battle against the Jin dynasty. Tolui died in 1232, and Ögedei appointed Sorghaghtani head of the Toluid appanage. Following the Mongol custom, Möngke inherited at least one of his father&#x27;s wives, Oghul-Khoimish of the Oirat clan. Möngke deeply loved her and gave special favor to her elder daughter, Shirin.

Ögedei dispatched him along with his relatives to attack the Kipchaks, Kievan Rus&#x27;, and Bulgars in the west in 1235. When the most formidable Kipchak chief, Bachman, fled to an island in the Volga delta Möngke crossed the river and captured him. When he ordered Bachman to bend down on his knees, Bachman refused and was executed by Möngke&#x27;s brother Bujek. Möngke also engaged in hand-to-hand combat during the Mongol invasion of Rus&#x27;. While his cousins, Shiban and Büri, went to Crimea, Möngke and Kadan, a son of Ögedei, were ordered to reduce the tribes in the Caucasus. The Mongols captured the Alan capital Maghas and massacred its inhabitants. Many chiefs of the Alans and Circassians surrendered to Möngke. After the invasion of Eastern Europe, Möngke would bring them back to Mongolia. He also participated in the Siege of Kiev (1240). Möngke was apparently taken by the splendour of Kiev and offered the city surrender, but his envoys were killed. After Batu&#x27;s army joined Möngke&#x27;s, they sacked the city. He also fought alongside Batu at the Battle of Mohi. In the summer of 1241, before the premature end of the campaign. Möngke returned home after his uncle Ögedei recalled him in the winter of 1240–41. However, Ögedei died in December 1241.

In 1246, Temüge, Genghis Khan&#x27;s sole remaining brother, unsuccessfully tried to seize the throne without confirmation by a kurultai. The new Khagan Güyük entrusted the delicate task of trying the Odchigin (&#x27;keeper of the hearth&#x27;a title given to both of Genghis&#x27; younger brothers) to Möngke and Orda Khan, the eldest brother of Batu. Güyük eventually died en route to the west in 1248 and Batu and Möngke emerged as the main contenders.

== Toluid revolution ==
Following his mother Sorghaghtani&#x27;s advice, Möngke went to the Golden Horde to meet Batu, who was afflicted with gout. Batu decided to support his election and called a kurultai at Ala Qamaq. The leader of the families of Genghis Khan&#x27;s brothers, and several important generals, came to the kurultai. Güyük&#x27;s sons Naqu and Khoja attended briefly but then left. Despite vehement objections from Bala, Oghul Qaimish&#x27;s scribe, the kurultai approved Möngke. Given its limited attendance and location, this kurultai was of questionable validity. Batu sent Möngke under the protection of his brothers, Berke and Tuqa-temur, and his son Sartaq to assemble a formal kurultai at Kodoe Aral in Mongolia. When Sorghaghtani and Berke organized a second kurultai on 1 July 1251, the assembled throng proclaimed Möngke the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, and a few of the Ögedeid and Chagatayid princes, such as his cousin Kadan and the deposed khan Qara Hülegü, acknowledged the decision.

Shortly thereafter, Oghul&#x27;s son Khoja and Ögedei&#x27;s favorite grandson came to &quot;pay homage&quot; to Möngke as the new ruler, but they brought the entire army of the Ögedei faction with them. Möngke&#x27;s Kankali falconer, Kheshig, discovered the preparations for the attack and told his lord. At the end of the investigation under his father&#x27;s loyal servant Menggesar noyan, he found his relatives guilty but at first wanted to give them mercy as written in the Great Yassa. Möngke&#x27;s officials opposed it and then he began to punish his relatives. The trials took place in all parts of the empire from Mongolia and China in the east to Afghanistan and Iraq in the west. Möngke and Batu&#x27;s brother Berke therefore arranged to have Oghul accused of using black magic against Möngke. After she was arrested and questioned by Sorghaghtani, Oghul Qaimish was sewn up into a sack and tossed into a river and drowned, the traditional Mongol punishment for using black magic. Estimates of the deaths of aristocrats, officials, and Mongol commanders include Eljigidei, Yesü Möngke, Büri, and Shiremun and range from 77 to 300. However, most of the princes descended from Genghis Khan who were involved in the plot were given some form of exile. The anti-Möngke plot of a Uyghur scribe, Bala, and the Idiqut Salindi (the monarch of the Uyghurs) was discovered and they were publicly executed. After his accession to the throne in 1251, Möngke announced that he would follow his ancestors but would not imitate the ways of other countries. To increase his legitimacy, in 1252 he retroactively awarded his father the title of &quot;Ikh Khagan&quot;. Möngke shared the western part of the empire with his ally Batu Khan, ensuring the unity of the empire. Möngke&#x27;s mother Sorghaghtani died in 1252.

After the defeat of the Ögedeid and Chagataid families, Möngke eliminated their estates and assigned acquiescent family members new territories either in Turkestan or in northwestern China. After the bloody purge, Möngke ordered a general amnesty for prisoners and captives. In another move to consolidate his power, Möngke gave his brothers Kublai and Hulagu supervisory powers in North China and Iran. Rumours spread that his brother Kublai founded a de facto independent &quot;ulus&quot; (district), and perhaps took for himself some of the tax receipts that should by rights be coming to Karakorum. In 1257 the Emperor sent two tax inspectors to audit Kublai&#x27;s official. They found fault, listed 142 breaches of regulations, accused Chinese officials, and even had some executed; Kublai&#x27;s office was abolished. Möngke&#x27;s authority took over the collection of all taxes in Kublai&#x27;s estates. As his Confucian and Buddhist advisers pointed out, Kublai first sent his wives to the court of Khagan and then appealed to Möngke in person. They embraced in tears and Möngke forgave his brother.

== Administrative ethos ==
Möngke drafted his own decrees and kept close watch on their revision. Möngke forbade practices of extravagant costs of the Borjigin and non-Borjigid nobles. He also limited gifts to the princes, converting them into regular salaries, and made the merchants subject to taxes. Möngke limited notorious abuses and sent imperial investigators to supervise the business of the merchants who were sponsored by the Mongols. He prohibited them from using the imperial relay stations, yam (route), and paizas, tablets that gave the bearer authority to demand goods and services from civilian populations. With Güyük dead, many local officials no longer wanted to pay off the paper drafts used by Güyük. Möngke recognized that if he did not meet the financial obligations of Güyük, it would make merchants reluctant to continue business with the Mongols. Möngke paid out all drafts drawn by high ranking Mongol elites to these merchants. Ata-Malik Juvayni stated, &quot;And from what book of history has it been read or heard...that a king paid the debt of another king?&quot; The generals and princes (including his son) who allowed their troops to plunder civilians without authorization were repeatedly punished by Möngke Khan. He used North Chinese, Muslim, and Uyghur officials. The Khagan&#x27;s chief judge (darughachi) was the Jait-Jalayir official , while the chief scribe was the Bulghai of the Keraites, who was a Christian. Nine of the 16 chief provincial officials of Möngke Khan were certainly Muslims. He reappointed Güyük&#x27;s three officials: Mahmud Yalavach in China, Masud Beg in Turkestan, and Arghun Aqa of the Oirat in Iran. Möngke separated the position of the great judge at court from that of chief scribe.

In 1253, Möngke established the Department of Monetary affairs to control the issuance of paper money in order to eliminate the over-issue of the currency by Mongol and non-Mongol nobles since the reign of Great Khan Ögedei. His authority established united measure based on &quot;sukhe&quot; or silver ingot, however, the Mongols allowed their foreign subjects to mint coins in the denominations and use weight they traditionally used. During the reigns of Ögedei, Güyük, and Möngke, Mongol coinage increased with gold and silver coinage in Central Asia and copper and silver coins in the Caucasus, Iran, and Bolghar.

Between 1252 and 1259, Möngke conducted a census of the Mongol Empire, including Iran, Afghanistan, Georgia, Armenia, Russia, Central Asia, and North China. While the census of China was completed in 1252, Novgorod in the far north-west was not counted until winter 1258–59. There was an uprising in Novgorod against Mongol rule in 1257, but Alexander Nevsky forced the city to submit to the Mongol census and taxation. The new census counted not only households but also the number of men aged 15–60 and the number of fields, livestock, vineyards, and orchards. Within the civilian register craftsmen were listed separately, while in the military registers auxiliary and regular households were distinguished. Clergy of the approved religions were separated and not counted. When the new register was completed, one copy was sent to Karakorum and one copy kept for the local administration. Möngke tried to create a fixed poll tax collected by imperial agents that could be forwarded to the needy units. Initially, the maximum rate was fixed at 10–11 gold dinars in the Middle East and 6–7 taels of silver in China. Protests from the landlord classes reduced this relatively low rate to 6–7 dinars and taels. Some officials raised the top rate on the wealthy of 500 dinars. While the reform did not lighten the tax burden, it made the payments more predictable. Even so, the census and the regressive taxation it facilitated sparked popular riots and resistance in the western districts.

In 1259, the Georgian king, David VI, revolted, unsuccessfully, against the Mongols and then fled to Kutaisi, whence he reigned over Imereti in western Georgia as de facto separate ruler. In 1261, he gave shelter to David VII, who had later attempted to end the Mongol dominance. David Ulu made peace with the Mongols, however, and returned to Tbilisi in 1262. Möngke and Batu&#x27;s official, Arghun, harshly punished the Georgian and Armenian nobles, plundering their cities and executing their prominent leaders. He divided the Georgians into six tumens. Meanwhile, Baiju crushed the rebellion of the Seljuk Sultan Kaykaus II near Ankara in 1256 and re-established Mongol authority over Eastern Turkey. By that time the Kashmiris had revolted, and Möngke appointed his generals, Sali and Takudar, to replace the court and a Buddhist master, Otochi, as darughachi to Kashmir. However, the Kashmiri king killed Otochi at Srinagar. Sali invaded again, killing the king, and put down the rebellion, after which the country remained subject to the Mongol Empire for many years.

== Religious policy ==
Möngke confirmed Güyük&#x27;s appointment of Haiyun as chief of all the Buddhists in the Mongol Empire in 1251. In 1253 Namo from Kashmir was made chief of all the Buddhist monks in the empire. During the conquest of Tibet in 1252–53, all Buddhist clergy were exempted from taxation. The Tibetan Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama, received Möngke&#x27;s patronage. Möngke had been impressed by the aged Taoist monk Qiu Chuji, who met his grandfather Genghis Khan in Afghanistan. Möngke made Li Zhichang chief of the Taoists. However, the Taoists had exploited their wealth and status by seizing Buddhist temples. Möngke demanded that the Taoists cease their denigration of Buddhism. Möngke ordered Kublai to end the clerical strife between the Taoists and Buddhists in his territory. Kublai called a conference of Taoist and Buddhist leaders in early 1258. At the conference, the Taoist claim was officially declared refuted, and Kublai forcibly converted their 237 temples to Buddhism and destroyed all copies of the fraudulent texts.

Despite his conquests of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Isma&#x27;ili state, Möngke favoured Muslim perceptions. He and Hulagu made the Twelver community at Najaf an autonomous tax-exempt ecclesiastical polity. Like his predecessors, he exempted clerics, monks, churches, mosques, monasteries, and doctors from taxation.

During Möngke&#x27;s reign, Louis IX of France sent William of Rubruck as a diplomat seeking an alliance with the Mongols against the Muslims. By that time Möngke&#x27;s khatun Oghul-Khoimish was already dead. After making the French envoy wait for many months, Möngke officially received William Rubruck on 24 May 1254. Rubruck informed him that he had come to spread the word of Jesus. Then he stayed to help the Christians in Karakorum and attended debates among rival religions organized by the Mongols. Möngke Khan summoned William Rubruck to send him back home in 1255. He told Rubruck:

Ambassadors from the Latin Empire and the Empire of Nicaea came to the Mongol court to negotiate terms with Möngke Khan as well. In 1252 King Hethum I of Lesser Armenia began his journey to Mongolia. He brought many sumptuous presents and met with Möngke at Karakorum. He had an audience with Möngke on 13 September 1254, advised the Khagan on Christian matters in Western Asia, and obtained from Möngke documents guaranteeing the inviolability of his person and his kingdom. As per Armenian documents, Hethum asked the Khagan and his officials to convert to Christianity. In reply, Möngke explained that he wished his subjects to truly worship the Messiah, but he could not force them to change their religion. Möngke also informed Hethum that he was preparing to mount an attack on Baghdad and that he would remit Jerusalem to the Christians if they collaborated with him. Hethum strongly encouraged other Crusaders to follow his example and submit to Mongol overlordship, but he persuaded only his son-in-law Bohemond VI, ruler of the Principality of Antioch and County of Tripoli, who offered his own submission sometime in the 1250s. The armies of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and Bohemond VI would assist Möngke&#x27;s army in the West soon.

Muslim rulers also presented their submission to Möngke in Karakorum, such as the Ayyubid ruler of Mayyafariqin Al-Kamil Muhammad, who went in person in 1253 and encountered there other Muslim rulers from Mosul (envoys of Badr al&#x27;Din Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;) and Mardin (Artuqids) offering their submission.

Shamans played an important role in the court and sometimes influenced the war preparation.

== Period of conquests ==

=== Capitulation of Goryeo ===
As Khagan, Möngke seemed to take the legacy of world conquest he had inherited much more seriously than had Güyük. His conquests were all directed at East Asia and the Middle East. In his first plans for additional conquests, Möngke chose Korea and the Dali Kingdom in Yunnan in 1252.

Möngke sent envoys to Goryeo, announcing his coronation in October 1251. He also demanded that King Gojong submit before him in person and to move his headquarters from Ganghwa Island to the mainland of Korea. But the Goryeo court refused to send the king because he was elderly and unable to travel so far. Möngke dispatched his envoys with specific tasks again. The envoys were well received by the Goryeo officials, but they criticized the Goryeo officials because their king did not follow his overlord Möngke&#x27;s orders. Möngke ordered prince Yeku to command the army against Korea. However, a Korean in the court of Möngke convinced them to begin their campaign in July 1253. Yeku, along with Amuqan, demanded that the Goryeo court surrender. The court refused but did not resist the Mongols and gathered the peasantry into mountain fortresses and islands. Working together with the Goryeo commanders who had joined the Mongols, Jalairtai Qorchi ravaged Korea. When one of Yeku&#x27;s envoys arrived, Gojong personally met him at his new palace. The king Gojong sent his stepson as hostage to Mongolia. The Mongols agreed to a truce in January 1254.

Möngke realized that the hostage was not the blood prince of the Goryeo dynasty and blamed the Goryeo court for deceiving him. Möngke&#x27;s commander Jalairtai devastated much of Goryeo and took 206,800 captives in 1254. Famine and despair forced peasants to surrender to the Mongols. They established a chiliarchy office at Yonghung with local officials. Ordering defectors to build ships, the Mongols began attacking the coastal islands from 1255 on. In the Liaodong Peninsula, the Mongols formed Korean defectors into a colony of eventually 5,000 households.

In 1258 the king and the Ch&#x27;oe clan retainer Kim Chun staged a counter-coup, assassinated the head of the Ch&#x27;oe family, and sued for peace. When the Goryeo court sent the future king Wonjong of Goryeo as hostage to the Mongol court and promised to return to Gaegyeong, the Mongols withdrew from Korea.

=== Dali, Vietnam and Tibet ===
Möngke concerned himself more with the war in China, outflanking the Song dynasty through the conquest of the Kingdom of Dali (in modern Yunnan) in 1254 and an invasion of Southeast Asia, which allowed the Mongols to invade from the north, west, and south.

Möngke Khan dispatched Kublai to the Dali Kingdom in 1253. The ruling family, Gao, resisted and murdered the Mongol envoys. The Mongols divided their forces into three. One wing rode eastward into the Sichuan basin. The second column under Uryankhadai took a difficult way into the mountains of western Sichuan. Kublai himself headed south over the grasslands, meeting up with the first column. With Uryankhadai galloping in along the lakeside from the north, Kublai took the capital city of Dali and spared the residents despite the slaying of his ambassadors. The Mongols appointed King Duan Xingzhi as local ruler and stationed a pacification commissioner there. After Kublai&#x27;s departure, unrest broke out among the Black jang. By 1256, Uryankhadai, the son of Subutai, had completely pacified Dali.

After subjugating the Dali, Kublai sent a column south under Uriyangkhadai, the son of Subutai. Uriyangkhadai sent envoys to ask the Vietnamese for a route to attack the Southern Song, but the Tran Vietnamese imprisoned the Mongol envoys. In 1257, a Mongol column under Uriyangkhadai invaded Vietnam (then known as Đại Việt) along with his son Aju and an army of 3,000 Mongols and 10,000 Yi tribesmen. They routed the Vietnamese army and sacked the capital Thăng Long (renamed Hanoi in 1831). Uriyangkhadai executed its inhabitants for the murder of the envoys. After staying in Thăng Long for a while, the Mongols fell ill due to the unfamiliar climate. Realizing that it was time to drive the Mongols out, the Vietnamese launched a counter-attack and won the decisive battle of Dong Bo Dau, and Uriyangkhadai withdrew. To avoid further war, the Tran sent tributes to the administration of Möngke.

To strengthen his control over Tibet, Möngke made Qoridai commander of the Mongol and Han troops in Tibet in 1251. In 1252–1253 Qoridai invaded Tibet, reaching as far as Damxung. The Central Tibetan monasteries submitted to the Mongols, and the Mongol princes divided them as their appanages.

=== Conflicts with the Delhi Sultanate ===

In 1252–53 Sali Noyan of the Tatar clan was sent to the Indian borderlands at the head of fresh troops and was given authority over the Qara&#x27;unas. Sali himself was subordinate to Möngke&#x27;s brother Hulagu. Due to the internal conflicts of the Delhi Sultanate, the Mamluk Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud&#x27;s brother, Jalal al-Din Masud, fled into Mongol territory in 1248. When Möngke was crowned as Khagan, Jalal al-Din Masud attended the ceremony and asked help from Möngke, who ordered Sali to assist him to recover his ancestral realm. Sali made successive attacks on Multan and Lahore. Sham al-Din Muhammad Kart, the client malik of Herat, accompanied the Mongols. Jalal al-Din was installed as client ruler of Lahore, Kujah, and Sodra. In 1254 the Delhi official Kushlu Khan offered his submission to Möngke and accepted a Mongol darughachi. When he failed to take Delhi, Kushlu turned to Hulagu. In the winter of 1257–1258, Sali Noyan entered Sind in strength and dismantled the fortifications of Multan; his forces may also have invested the island fortress of Bakhkar on the Indus.

=== Conquest of the Middle East ===


When Möngke called a kurultai to prepare the next conquest in 1252–1253, the Sultanate of Rum and the Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;id dynasty of Mosul were subject to the Mongol Empire. The Ayyubid ruler of Mayyafariqin, Malik Kamil, and his cousin in Aleppo and future Sultan, Malik Nasir Yusuf, sent envoys to Möngke Khan, who imposed darughachis (overseers) and a census on the Diyarbakır area.

Möngke followed the schemes of his predecessor against the Nizari Ismailis (Assassins). Möngke&#x27;s decision to launch a campaign against Nizari castles followed anti-Nizari urges by Sunnis in the Mongol court, new anti-Nizari complaints (including Shams-ud-Din, the chief judge of Qazvin), and warnings from local Mongol commanders in Persia. In 1252, Möngke entrusted the mission of conquering the rest of Western Asia to his brother Hülegü, with the highest priority being the conquest of the Nizari state and the Abbasid Caliphate. In 1253, William of Rubruck sent on a mission to Karakorum in Mongolia, was struck by the security precautions there, reportedly in response to the more than forty assassins who had been sent by Imam Ala al-Din Muhammad there to assassinate Möngke; it is possible that the assassination attempt was merely rumored.

Möngke ordered the Jochid and Chagataid families to join Hulagu&#x27;s expedition to Iran and strengthened the army with 1,000 siege engineers from China. Möngke&#x27;s armies, led by his brother Hulagu, launched an attack on the Ismailis in Iran, crushing the last major resistance there by the end of 1256. The Hashashin Imam Rukn ad-Din requested permission to travel to Karakorum to meet with the Great Khan Möngke himself. Hulagu sent him on the long journey to Mongolia, but once the Imam arrived there, Möngke criticized his action and dismissed him. Rukn ad-Din was killed in uncertain circumstances.

For the Abbasids, envoys from Baghdad attended the coronation of Möngke in 1251 to come to terms with the Mongols. However, Möngke told Hulagu that if the caliph Al-Musta&#x27;sim refused to meet him in person, then Hulagu was to destroy Baghdad. Hulagu then advanced on Iraq, taking the capital at Baghdad in 1258. Hulagu sent Möngke some of his war booty with the news of his conquest of Baghdad. Möngke dispatched a Chinese messenger to congratulate him for his victory. Outraged by the attack on the caliphate, Malik Kamil revolted, killing his Mongol overseer. Hulagu&#x27;s son Yoshumut invested Mayyafariqin and executed Malik Kamil. From there they moved into Syria in 1259, took Damascus and Aleppo, and reached the shores of the Mediterranean. Fearing the Mongol advance, the Ayyubid Sultan Malik Nasir Yusuf refused to see Hulagu and fled. However, the Mongols captured him at Gaza.

=== South China ===

In 1241, Töregene Khatun had sent an envoy to make peace proposals and discuss with Zhao Yun (posthumously known as Emperor Lizong). The Song court arrested the envoy and imprisoned him in a fortress with his suite of seventy persons. The envoy died, but his suite were detained until 1254. That year the Mongol army attacked to take Hejiu but failed. The Chinese freed the suite of the late envoy to show their desire for peace. Möngke concentrated all his attention on the conquest of the Song dynasty. Taking personal command late in the decade, he captured many of the fortified cities along the northern front.

In 1252, Möngke commissioned Kublai and experienced general Uriyangkhadai to conquer the Dali Kingdom. From the summer of 1253 to early 1254, the campaigns were successful in conquering and pacifying the tribes, with Uriyangkhadai&#x27;s military experience proving invaluable in battle. After Kublai&#x27;s return to northern China, Uriyangkhadai conquered neighboring tribes in Tibet before turning east towards the Trần dynasty by 1257.

In October 1257, Möngke set out for South China, leaving his administration to his brother, Ariq Böke, in Karakorum with Alamdar as assistant, and fixed his camps near the Liu-pan mountains in May of the following year. He first attacked Song positions in Sichuan and took Paoning (modern-day Langzhong) in 1258. Möngke forbade his army to plunder civilians. When his son accidentally destroyed a crop in the field of the Chinese peasants, Möngke punished him.

Meanwhile, Uriyangkhadai&#x27;s forces invaded Vietnam with generals Trechecdu and Aju and captured the Trần dynasty capital of Thang Long in 1258. While Chinese source material incorrectly stated that Uriyangkhadai withdrew from Vietnam after nine days due to poor climate, his forces did not leave until 1259.

On 18 February 1259, Tsagaan Sar, the Mongol New Year feast was given by Möngke near the mountain Zhonggui. At this feast his relative, Togan, a chief of the Jalairs, declared that South China was dangerous because of its climate, and that the Great Khagan should go northward for safety. Baritchi of the Erlat tribe called this advice cowardly and advised Möngke to remain with his army. These words pleased Möngke who wished to take the city nearby. The Song commander slew his envoy who had been sent to ask the city&#x27;s submission.

In 1259, Uriyangkhadai&#x27;s forces attacked Guangxi from Thang Long as part of a coordinated Mongol attack in 1259 with armies attacking in Sichuan under Möngke and other Mongol armies attacking in modern-day Shandong and Henan.

== Death ==
There is no consensus concerning Möngke Khan&#x27;s death. His last recorded appearances were at the Siege of Diaoyucheng near modern-day Chongqing; where it is also generally agreed he died. After his death, the Mongol armies were forced to withdraw from action. Chinese sources record Möngke as having been killed in battle during an assault on the fortress: a contemporary Song poem describes the &quot;victory in Sichuan&quot; where Möngke was killed by a crossbow arrow, which is corroborated in the writing of the Syriac monk Bar Hebraeus. The account in the &quot;History of Yuan&quot;, which was written during the Ming dynasty, relates that Möngke was fatally wounded instead by a stone projectile from either a cannon or trebuchet.

Persian accounts largely originating from Rashid al-Din claim that Möngke died of dysentery or cholera near the site of the siege on 11 August 1259 — the &quot;History of Yuan&quot; does not directly corroborate this, but it mentions a fatal disease outbreak in the Mongol camp during the campaign. In line with the lack of clarity in Mongol historiography concerning the deaths of khans, it has been speculated that possible that Mongols covered up the story by claiming that his death was due to illness, leading to the story in Persian accounts.

Other accounts include those of the Armenian historian Hayton of Corycus&#x27;s claims that Möngke was on a Mongol war ship that sank in the Chinese seas while the Mongols were besieging an island fortress. Hayton&#x27;s work is noted for including errors and amalgamating distinct events, so the account of Möngke&#x27;s death could be a confused reference to the later Mongol invasions of Japan.

A month after Möngke&#x27;s death, his youngest wife Chubei died at the Liupanshan Mountains. Möngke&#x27;s son Asutai conducted the corpse to Burkhan Khaldun, Mongolia, where the late Khagan was buried near the graves of Genghis and Tolui.

Möngke&#x27;s death in 1259 led to the four-year Toluid Civil War between his two younger brothers, Kublai Khan and Ariq Böke. Though Kublai Khan eventually won, the succession war and the subsequent Kaidu–Kublai war essentially resulted in the permanent division of the Mongol Empire. It was not until 1304, when all Mongol khans submitted to Kublai&#x27;s successor, Temür Khan, that the Mongol world again acknowledged a single paramount sovereign, although the authority of the late Khagans rested on nothing like the same foundations as that of Genghis Khan and his first three successors.

When Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty in China in 1271, Möngke Khan was placed on the official record of the dynasty as Xianzong ().

== Foreign influence in Karakorum ==

In 1252–53, Flemish missionary and explorer William of Rubruck saw Hungarians, Russians, Germans, and a Parisian goldsmith, Guillaume Boucher, in Karakorum. He even heard of Saxon miners in Dzungaria and other foreigners such as a woman from the Duchy of Lorraine mastered yurt-making.

In 1253, Möngke deported households from China proper to repair and maintain the imperial ordas. He decorated the capital city of Karakorum with Chinese, European, and Persian architectures. One example of the construction was a large silver tree, with pipes that discharge various drinks and a triumphant angel at its top, made by Guillaume Boucher. Foreign merchants’ quarters, Buddhist monasteries, mosques, and churches were newly built. Markets were in the Muslim sector and outside the four gates. Ethnic Han Chinese farmers grew vegetables and grains outside the wall of Karakorum.

<text>Treble Cone is the closest ski area to Wānaka, New Zealand.

Treble Cone is the largest ski area in the South Island, boasting the longest vertical rise in the Queenstown Southern Lakes District. Treble Cone is most known for its views over Lake Wānaka and Mount Aspiring/Tititea and its intermediate to advanced terrain. The ski field has been the off-season training ground for the national ski team of Austria.

==History==
Founded by Rod Aubrey, Murray Raffills (Raffills Ridge namesake) and Ralph Markby in 1968, Treble Cone started out as a small club field managed by local ski enthusiasts.

In 1975, Treble Cone was listed as a public company to raise funds for a high standard road, modest base building and ski hire facilities, constructed over the summer and opened in 1976. Development continued throughout the &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s with the mountain&#x27;s first double chair installed in the Home Basin in 1983, a T-Bar in the Saddle Basin in 1989 and the first permanent snowmaking facilities in 1991.

Treble Cone received its next major upgrade in 1995/96 with the installation of New Zealand&#x27;s first high speed, detachable 6-seater chairlift in the Home Basin. The double chair was moved to improve access to the Saddle Basin. There were also major extensions to the base building, a new car parking area was developed, and a snowmaking pond was installed.

Earthworks dominated development in the 2000s (summers of 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011), improving the beginner and intermediate terrain in the Home and Saddle Basin and access to the Saddle Basin.

In 2005, Treble Cone saw a new fixed grip quad chairlift in the Saddle Basin and Ski Patrol hut at the top of the Six Seater. In 2006 and again in 2007, further investment increased snowmaking across the Home Basin.

Along with Cardrona Ski Area, Treble Cone updated its sales and ticketing systems in 2011/12, enabling the launch of OnePassNZ, a shared lift pass. The RFID ticketing system allowed guests with pre-paid passes to ski straight to the gate, as well as to track vertical and number of runs skied.

In December 2019, the Commerce Commission approved the purchase of Treble Cone Investments Ltd by Cardrona Alpine Resort. In early 2020, Cardrona reported that they were working towards merging the operations and marketing of the two resorts.

==Winter activities==

Treble Cone is the largest ski area in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, equalled only by Roundhill after the installation of a 1.44 km (0.9 miles) rope tow (world&#x27;s longest rope tow) in 2010. Treble Cone has a vertical rise of 700m creating the longest runs in Queenstown Southern Lakes District, including the 4 km High Street to Easy Rider beginner to intermediate groomed run.
Treble Cone is most known for its fairly steep and challenging terrain, which it claims is some of the best in the country. Recent earthworks initiatives have however ensure that beginner to intermediate skiers and boarders are fully catered for. These include providing more expansive beginner and intermediate groomed trails for skiers and boarders in both the Home and Saddle Basin, and a free beginner surface lift and ski area near the base facilities. There is also a small terrain park and kids&#x27; fun trail to explore.

The thriving backcountry ski and snowboard scene around Queenstown and Wānaka uses Treble Cone as an access point to some of the best out-of-bound terrain in the region. The resort sells a discounted lift pass to help backcountry users access this terrain from Treble Cone&#x27;s summit. Backcountry tours also leave from Treble Cone, operated by Aspiring Guides.

===Getting to Treble Cone===
Treble Cone is a 35-minute drive from Wānaka or a 90-minute drive from Queenstown. During the winter, various options are available, including door to door shuttles from both, Queenstown and Wānaka as well as flights from Queenstown.

===Aspiring Avalanche Dogs===
Based at Treble Cone, Aspiring Avalanche dogs is a non-profit organisation and a registered charity that provides a primary response avalanche search dog service to the ski areas and backcountry of the Southern Lakes Region. The highly trained dog teams can be rapidly deployed around the clock to help locate skiers, snowboarders and mountaineers unlucky enough to be caught in an avalanche.

===Rookie Academy===
Based at Treble Cone, Rookie Academy is a world-class incubator of ski and snowboard instructor training. Rookie Academy runs instructor training courses from 2 weeks to 11 weeks in duration, aiming at preparing candidates for NZSIA, BASI, CSIA, (Canadian association of Snowboard Instructors (CASI)), PSIA instructor exams.

===Ski Patrol Certificate===
Run by Tai Poutini Polytechnic at Treble Cone, students train towards completing a Certificate Level 3 in Ski Patrol, providing them with the skills required for a role as a first year ski patroller. Many of the successful candidates go on to work as ski patrollers throughout the world as well as guiding, backcountry touring and emergency care and safety management.

===Season pass prices===
Treble Cone controversially raised its season pass prices for the 2007 season to NZ$2200 after 31 May, with “early bird” pre-season passes being NZ$1500. The early bird pass was a free upgrade from a 50-day season pass to a premium pass due to public and local community consultation. There have been many letters to newspapers and a general upset towards Treble Cone. Treble Cone management has released media statements

In 2008, the company was required to raise extra capital from its shareholders to cover the loss. Season pass pricing was determined to be the problem. As a result, pre-season passes for 2009 were dropped to $990. Locals have strongly supported the change.

==Summer activities==
Historically, Treble Cone has opened the six seater chairlift for hiking and mountain biking. In 2007, this included hosting the first downhill event of the NZ Community Trust National Series in the weekend. 195 riders raced against the clock on the 2.5 km downhill trail. Currently, there are no plans to continue the summer field operations.

==Proposed gondola==
The gondola was approved late in 2008, with a 10-year building consent. Due to the current economic climate, there appears to be no desire to install the lift in the short term.

On Friday 14 July 2006, The Press ran a story on Treble Cone Investments lodging resource consent applications regarding a proposed gondola from Cattle Flat (at the base of the ski field access road) to the ski field itself. The proposed gondola would travel 3.3 km in under 11 minutes, and be capable of carrying 2000 people an hour. It would rise 945 m.

Talk of a gondola has been around for some time, but has been re-ignited recently due to the deaths of three young Australian skiers when they drove off the access road in 2004. The access road is under regular criticism from patrons because of its corrugations, steep incline with tight switchbacks and lack of safety barriers. It also coincides with other objectives for the ski field, said Treble Cone director, Richard Hanson. An increase in ticket prices in 2006 seems to be to help the funding of the building project. On good days the field is always short of car parking, and cars may be parked up to a kilometre down the access road. Because of these reasons the gondola is a very popular proposal with locals except for the likelihood of more overcrowding at the resort.

<text>Jonathan Ionatana Falefasa Umaga (; ; born 27 May 1973) is a New Zealand former rugby union footballer and former captain of the national team, the All Blacks. He is head coach of Moana Pasifika in the Super Rugby competition. He was granted and uses the Samoan chiefly honorific title of &quot;Faalogo&quot;, meaning &quot;the listener&quot;. 

He played for the Hurricanes from Super 12&#x27;s inception in 1996 and took over the captaincy in 2003. Graham Henry named him as All Blacks captain in 2004; under his leadership the All Blacks won 19 of their 22 games including the clean sweep of the British &amp; Irish Lions and the Grand Slam in 2005. At the end of 2005, after 74 Test caps (where he scored 36 tries), Umaga retired from international rugby. Umaga played four games in 2007 for the Wellington Lions in the Air New Zealand Cup, to play 100 matches for the province, before taking up the position of coach at Toulon.

During his first season coaching in 2008–09 season Toulon was a poor performer in the first half of the season and facing a relegation scare, and there was speculation that he would be replaced by Philippe Saint-André. Umaga returned to a playing role for Toulon in the second half of that season, and at the same time announced that he would not continue as head coach beyond that season. After helping Toulon exit relegation trouble (they ultimately finished ninth that season), he retired as a player, and remained at Toulon as assistant coach for backs under Saint-André. In March 2010, Umaga again returned to the playing ranks following a serious hip injury to Christian Loamanu. Umaga returned to New Zealand after the 2009–10 French season to become a player-coach with Counties Manukau and played with the Waikato Chiefs in the 2011 Super Rugby competition.

== Early life ==

Umaga was born in Lower Hutt, Wellington, New Zealand. He was born to Samoan immigrant parents, and grew up playing rugby league. Umaga originally aspired to play football in childhood, before being persuaded by his father to play rugby instead. Umaga played for the Wainuiomata Lions and rose through the ranks, making the Wellington U-16 and U-17 sides, and was eventually named in the Junior Kiwi side of 1991.The side also featured future National Rugby League stars Joe Vagana, Ruben Wiki and Gene Ngamu. That same year he signed with the Newcastle Knights but within three weeks was back on the plane to New Zealand because of homesickness. He never did play a First-Grade NSWRL Premiership game. In 1993 Tana&#x27;s brother Mike, who played rugby union for Manu Samoa, persuaded him to take up rugby union in 1994. The brothers played on opposite teams in a Test match between Samoa and New Zealand in 1999 during which Tana scored two tries (the All Blacks won 71–13).

== Rugby union career ==
=== 1994–1999 ===
Umaga played wing for the Wellington Lions in 1994 and quickly became a fixture in the starting line-up alongside his brother who also played on the wing. Umaga scored more tries than any other player within the team for three successive years, and in 1996 was selected for the original Hurricanes squad.
He also played for Italian team Viadana Rugby in the 1994–1995 Italian season. In his second season playing for the Hurricanes he scored a New Zealand record of 12 tries (now broken by Rico Gear) and earned a call up to the national team at the expense of an ill Jonah Lomu. He scored a try in his debut test match. With Jonah Lomu regaining his fitness, coupled with a drop in form, Umaga was dropped from the All Blacks until the 1999 season. To accommodate outside backs Umaga, Lomu, Wilson and Cullen 1996–99 All Black coach John Hart moved Fullback Christian Cullen into the midfield.

=== 2000 and 2001 ===

With a new coach in Wayne Smith Tana Umaga became the regular wing in the All Blacks line-up. Worries about the shape of the team were swept aside when the team smashed Tonga 102–0, in a game where debutantes Troy Flavell and Doug Howlett starred. He also played in the first Bledisloe Cup match in 2000, dubbed &quot;the game of the century&quot;, scoring an early try. He signed a new four-year contract with the NZRU, and when Alama Ieremia took up a contract in Japan, Umaga decided to shift his focus to centre, despite scoring 9 tries in 7 tests on the wing that year. After having played just one match at centre for the Hurricanes, Umaga slotted into the midfield for the All Blacks against France, the team that beat the All Blacks in the semi-final of the World cup the previous year. Umaga had a strong game in a victory. The 2000 season was one of Umaga&#x27;s best, with him being awarded the Kelvin Tremain Memorial Trophy for New Zealand rugby player of the year. While the Smith era introduced a number of new players into the New Zealand team, they could not reclaim the Tri Nations or Bledisloe Cup in 2000 or 2001. This led to his sacking and the hiring of former All Black mid-week player and successful Chiefs coach John Mitchell.

=== 2002 and 2003 ===
Moving Umaga to the centres was not to everyone&#x27;s liking claim this as a reason for his loss of pace. Despite this Umaga was named as captain of the Wellington Lions and vice captain of the All Blacks under Anton Oliver in John Mitchell&#x27;s first squad. Early on, John Mitchell and assistant coach Robbie Deans favoured Crusader Mark Robinson in the midfield. The squad to play against Italy and Ireland as well as compete in the Tri Nations did not feature Umaga. Despite news reports about him carrying a knee injury, on the day when the All Blacks were to take on Italy, Umaga played for his club Petone.

Umaga, along with Taine Randell the All Blacks 1999 world cup captain, were asked to play for the New Zealand Barbarians against the New Zealand Māori. Randell himself was Māori and did not wish to play against them, and Umaga was placed on the wing a position stated he didn&#x27;t want to play. After the game Umaga received a call-up to the national team to play Fiji, but injured his knee mid game. Umaga told the coaches he was fit for selection for the Bledisloe match tie against Australia but was again no selected, Daryl Gibson taking the spot on the bench. Umaga again turned out for Petone.

Umaga came off the bench against South Africa at his home ground Westpac Stadium. Umaga would go on to make the Tri-Nations XV; a team based on Zurich world player rankings. Many considered him a good chance to take over the captaincy on the end of year tour from injured regular captain Reuben Thorne, but that role was instead handed to Taine Randell. Umaga was to lead the Hurricanes in 2003, taking over from Gordon Slater, under coach Colin Cooper. The Hurricanes made the semi-finals for just the second time in their history after winning a team record seven times in a row, shedding the inconsistent tag that had plagued them since the competition&#x27;s inception. His form was recognised and he was rewarded with a spot in the All Blacks, named as vice-captain under Reuben Thorne who would lead the team to the World Cup.

In a test match against Wales on 21 June 2003, Welsh captain Colin Charvis was knocked out in a tackle from All Blacks forward Jerry Collins. Umaga stopped playing despite his team being in an attacking position; to check that Charvis had not swallowed his mouthguard. He placed him in the recovery position and for this act, the Council of the International Fair Play Committee awarded Umaga the Pierre de Coubertin World Trophy for outstanding sportsmanship. Umaga was the first New Zealander to receive the award. The Welsh Rugby Union also presented him with a figurine to honour the display of sportsmanship.

The All Blacks defeated the Springboks 52–16 and the Wallabies 50–21 away from home in consecutive weeks. New Zealand won both home matches as well, claiming the Tri Nations title and the Bledisloe Cup. This was the first time the All Blacks had won the Bledisloe since 1997. The performance had them regarded as early favourites to win the years World Cup, along with the eventual winners England.

The opening match of the tournament was to be the All Black last Rugby World Cup appearance. In an attempted back line move, Umaga collided with star Five-Eighth Carlos Spencer. Spencer came out unhurt but unfortunately Umaga suffered a damaged posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and was forced to leave the field. Umaga would not be play again in the tournament despite being declared fit to play in the semi-final by then All Blacks doctor John Mayhew. Leon MacDonald the regular backup Fullback, was preferred in the centre spot. The All Blacks would lose the game to Australia 22–10 and again fail to reach the final.

The aftermath of the world cup was similar to the last, as coach John Mitchell was dropped. Only two coaches applied for the position of All Blacks head coach, Mitchell who re-applied and Graham Henry. Graham Henry was the former coach of the Blues and was told he would never receive the top job after leaving New Zealand shores to take up a contract with the Wales national team. Henry&#x27;s experience in New Zealand and overseas, as well as the skill shown in turning around the Welsh team worked in his favour and he secured the job.

=== All Black captain: 2004 and 2005 ===
Graham Henry&#x27;s first choice as captain of his team was Umaga, and after a disappointing Super 12, in which the Hurricanes came 11th, was selected to replace Reuben Thorne. He was the first New Zealander of Pacific Island heritage to captain the All Blacks in a test match. Umaga&#x27;s captaincy began well, with victory in the first six tests, including two victories against World Cup holders England. One of them, a 36–3 win at Carisbrook in Dunedin, was at the time the heaviest loss ever by the team that won the most recent Rugby World Cup. The All Blacks of 2004 successfully managed to regain the Bledisloe Cup. The winning run came to an end, when the All Blacks lost in both away games against Australia and South Africa, putting the All Blacks out of contention for the 2004 Tri Nations series. In Paris in 2004 Umaga became the first New Zealand rugby player of non-Maori descent to lead the Haka, thus making him the Prematch Haka leader.

In the 2004 end-of-year tour he oversaw the 45–6 victory over France. Umaga also celebrated his 100th match for the Hurricanes, when his team overcame the Blues. They made the semi-final for the second time in three years, but again stumbled to a loss to the champion Crusaders. In 2005 the British &amp; Irish Lions toured, on top of the Tri Nations and the potential Grand Slam tour of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.

Umaga was involved in an incident in the first Test of the Lions&#x27; tour on 25 June 2005 that caused friction between the Lions and the All Blacks. Early in the Test, Umaga and hooker Keven Mealamu upended Lions captain Brian O&#x27;Driscoll in a post-ruck clean-out. O&#x27;Driscoll required surgery on a dislocated shoulder and missed the rest of the tour.
The British and Irish media accused Umaga of foul play. O&#x27;Driscoll and Lions management characterised the incident as a &quot;deliberate spear tackle&quot;. The independent citing commissioner found that neither Umaga nor Mealamu had a case to answer at the time due to inconclusive evidence, but after viewing new amateur footage of the incident, Greg Thomas, communications manager for the sport&#x27;s governing body, the International Rugby Board (IRB), described the incident as &quot;unacceptably dangerous&quot; and stated that IRB was instructing referees to suspend players for three to six months for such offences. Daily Telegraph London journalist Brendan Gallagher labelled it as one of the fifty &#x27;ugliest moments&#x27; in sports.
In August 2014 Brian O&#x27;Driscoll renewed his rivalry with Tana Umaga when he completed the ALS ice bucket challenge and immediately nominated the Umaga.
New Zealand was undefeated during the Lions tour and won the Tri-Nations, which included the retention of the Bledisloe Cup. The IRB shortlisted Umaga for their 2005 International Player of the Year award (an honour eventually won by fellow All Black Dan Carter). Umaga also led the All Blacks to their second Northern Hemisphere Grand Slam. After playing 74 test matches for his country, Umaga confirmed his retirement from international rugby at a press conference on 10 January 2006. His main reason for retiring was to spend more time with his family as he had just had another child with his wife Rochelle. Umaga&#x27;s announcement led to Richie McCaw succeeding him as captain. Umaga gave the All Blacks shirt he wore in his final game to Sonny Bill Williams, who stated afterwards: &quot;Just getting that jersey gave me butterflies. Hopefully one day I can put on the real thing.&quot;

=== 2006 and 2007 ===
For the 2006 Super 14 season Umaga handed the Hurricanes captaincy to All Black number eight Rodney So&#x27;oialo to focus on his own game. The Hurricanes reached the semi-finals for the third time in four years. Out drinking after the 2006 Super 14 Final – in which the Hurricanes lost to the Crusaders – Umaga was seen in a bar hitting teammate Chris Masoe with a woman&#x27;s handbag, breaking her cell phone, after Masoe allegedly attempted to strike another patron. Umaga replaced the woman&#x27;s damaged cell phone, and the woman went on to sell her handbag and broken cell phone for NZD23,000 on the New Zealand internet auction site Trade Me. In the 2006 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Umaga was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby.

In the months to come he was reported to be on the wish lists of many top European clubs; his former All Black&#x27;s teammate Andrew Mehrtens was forced to publicly deny rumours that Umaga was a target of his club at the time – Harlequins. Umaga eventually signed for French club Toulon that had been recently relegated from the Top 14 to Pro D2. His contract allowed him to play the entire 2006 Air New Zealand Cup (ANZ Cup) season for Wellington before travelling to France. He ended up playing only seven matches for Toulon as Wellington made the ANZ Cup final. He nonetheless made roughly €350,000 (US$438,000/GBP 250,000) that Toulon&#x27;s co-presidents reportedly paid out of their own pockets. The day before playing his first match for Toulon he was awarded the medal of honour of the city of Toulon (médaille d&#x27;or de la ville) by Mayor Hubert Falco. On 29 October 2006, Umaga started in his first game three days after arriving in Toulon scoring his team&#x27;s only try in a 22–16 victory against Lyon. He was surprised to see how close to the players the fans were and how noisy the atmosphere was.

Umaga returned to New Zealand at the end of his contract with Toulon following their 7 January 2007 win over Grenoble. When Umaga arrived in Toulon they were ninth in the Pro D2 table; when he left they had risen to third. Toulon won eight of nine matches with Umaga on the roster – the only loss coming when he was out injured. Umaga played his last season for the Hurricanes in 2007. His last match for them was on 5 May 2007 at Wellington&#x27;s Westpac Stadium. On 25 September 2007, Umaga released a book detailing his career.

=== 2011 return ===
Umaga was named in the Chiefs&#x27; starting line-up for their opening Super Rugby fixture of the 2011 season to face the ACT Brumbies. This signalled his first Super rugby game since he was a Wellington Hurricanes regular in 2007. After playing 7 games he officially retired as a player at the end of 2011 ITM cup season.

=== Leading of the haka ===
Umaga led the team before many test matches the Ka Mate version of the haka and was the first to lead the team with the newer Kapa o pango version in 2005 against South Africa. In total he was leader for Kapa o Pango two times.

== Coaching ==

During the 2008/09 Top 14 season, Umaga&#x27;s coaching future was uncertain because Toulon were struggling at midseason and were in danger of relegation. This led to speculation in January 2009 that he would be replaced as manager by Philippe Saint-André. This was confirmed on 27 January 2009, with Umaga taking on the role as player/manager at the age of 35, and at the same time announcing he would not return as head coach for the following season. A late-season return to form eventually brought Toulon to mid-table safety in ninth place. Saint-André took on the managing role effective at the beginning of the 2009/10 season, but kept Umaga on as Toulon&#x27;s backs coach. On Friday, 12 March 2010, Counties Manukau announced that Umaga had signed for the province as a player coach for the Air New Zealand Cup. Counties competed well, with two hard-fought Ranfurly Shield challenges and a peak of second on the points table. Counties ended the season in ninth.

Umaga was widely tipped to sign on as head of the Blues franchise for the 2016 Super Rugby competition, following the resignation of Sir John Kirwan from this role in June 2015.

It was confirmed on 23 June 2015 that Umaga would take over as head coach of The Blues at the end of the 2015 ITM Cup Season. Umaga held the position of Head Coach between 2016 and 2018, when he was replaced by Leon MacDonald, but would remain as part of a stable coaching set up as Defence coach.

It was announced on 9 June 2023, that Umaga would take over as the head coach of the Moana Pasifika rugby team for the 2024 Super Rugby Pacific season after the departure of previous head coach Aaron Mauger.

== Family ==
Umaga&#x27;s brother Mike has represented Samoa at both rugby union and rugby league. Their cousin Jerry Collins was also an All Black. Nephews Peter and Thomas Umaga-Jensen have also represented Wellington at rugby at senior level. Romanian international Jack Umaga and Samoan international Sinoti Sinoti are also close relatives of Umaga.

Umaga is married to Rochelle; the couple have four children together.

== Personal life ==
After retiring from professional rugby, Umaga began training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. In 2022 he earned a silver medal as a brown belt at the IBJJF Masters Worlds competition. Shortly after this achievement, Umaga was promoted to black belt in the sport by his coaches at Alliance Jiu-Jitsu in Auckland, New Zealand.

Umaga has an aviation waypoint named in his honor. UMAGA is a waypoint located south 10 nautical miles south of Wellington Airport&#x27;s Runway 34. It is the Initial Approach Fix for most approaches into Runway 34. The exact coordinates are 174° 47&#x27; 43.12&quot; E 41° 29&#x27; 54.63&quot; S.

<doc id="742615" wikidata="Q5672499" url="?curid=742615" title="Harry Snell, 1st Baron Snell">
<text>Henry Snell, 1st Baron Snell (1 April 1865 – 21 April 1944), was a British socialist politician and campaigner. He served in government under Ramsay MacDonald and Winston Churchill, and as the Labour Party&#x27;s leader in the House of Lords in the late 1930s.

==Background==
Born in Sutton-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, the son of agricultural workers, Harry Snell was educated at his local village school before beginning work as a farm hand at the age of eight. He worked full-time from the age of ten and became an indoor servant at the farm aged twelve. Dissatisfied with this work, Snell left and travelled around the county, taking a variety of jobs including work as a groom and at Hazelford Ferry on the River Trent and as a French polisher in Nottingham. During long periods of unemployment he occupied himself with extensive reading, and was particularly influenced by the writing of Henry George. Inspired by Charles Bradlaugh and the cause of secularism in Nottingham 1881, he joined the National Secular Society. He rejected the austere and literalist Anglicanism of his up-bringing, but retained some religious faith and decided to join the Unitarian Church, impressed by its scientific approach to Christian doctrine and its progressive and tolerant values.

A Unitarian teacher, John Kentish-White, introduced Snell to the works of Lord Byron and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Through acquaintances made in the Unitarian movement, Snell was able to find a job in London as a clerk at the offices of the Midland Institute for the Blind. Here he continued his self-education at the reference library of University College London, being influenced by the writings of Thomas Paine, William Morris, John Ruskin and John Stuart Mill. Eventually Unitarianism would grow even too strict for him, and he became an agnostic and member of the National Secular Society, and a &quot;devoted advocate&quot; of the Ethical Union (now Humanists UK). Of his ties to the British Ethical movement, he once remarked:

After hearing Annie Besant address a meeting of the Secular Society on the subject of socialism, Snell joined the Social Democratic Federation. He worked on John Burns&#x27; campaign for Parliament in 1885, and began to address public meetings himself, appearing alongside the likes of Henry Hyndman, Tom Mann, Eleanor Marx and Ben Tillett. He was active in supporting the Bryant and May match factory strike and the London dock strike of 1889.

==Member of Parliament==
In 1890, Snell began social work for the Woolwich Charity Organisation Society, and later became secretary to the director of the London School of Economics. He joined the Independent Labour Party and, in 1894, the Fabian Society, travelling extensively around Britain to lecture on socialist topics with speakers including Ramsay MacDonald and Bruce Glasier. Snell also lectured for the British South Place Ethical Society (eventually becoming President) and its American counterpart. Snell stood unsuccessfully in Huddersfield as a candidate for the Labour Party in January and December 1910 and 1918. He was elected to the London County Council in 1919, serving until 1925, and became Member of Parliament for Woolwich East, the seat formerly held by Will Crooks, at the 1922 General Election, being re-elected in 1929.
In late 1929, Snell was appointed to the Shaw Commission, which had been set up to investigate Arab uprisings in Palestine. When the Commission published its findings in March 1931, Snell delivered a Minority Report, disagreeing with the Commission&#x27;s recommendation that Jewish immigration and land purchase be curtailed. Snell also dissented from the Commission&#x27;s claims that Palestine was overcrowded, agreeing with reports published two years earlier that had found the area to be under-populated and greatly under-cultivated. He described the impact of Jewish immigration as having raised the standard of living for Arab workers, and asserted that the Commission was wrongly and dangerously encouraging the view that immigration was a menace to Arabs and threatened their economic future. Following this, Snell became a strong supporter of Zionism.

From 1931 to 1932, he served as President of the British Ethical Union (now known as Humanists UK), an organisation promoting humanism as a non-religious basis for morality.

Snell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1930 Birthday Honours.

==House of Lords==
Snell resigned his seat in the Commons in 1931, to make way for George Hicks, a leading member of the Trades Union Congress, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Snell, of Plumstead in the County of Kent, on 23 March 1931. Ramsay MacDonald made him Under-Secretary of State for India and, upon the formation of the National Government a few months later, asked Snell to continue in this role. However, Snell refused, choosing to remain loyal to the Labour Party. In the Lords, he spoke on agricultural issues, with particular concern for rural workers, and on foreign affairs, and was a member of the British Institute of Parliamentary Affairs and the Empire Parliamentary Association. He was also appointed to the British Council, eventually becoming vice-chairman. In 1935, when Arthur Ponsonby chose to resign with George Lansbury, Snell became Labour&#x27;s leader in the Lords, serving under Clement Attlee. He published an autobiography, &quot;Men, Movements and Myself&quot;, in 1936, and was made a Privy Counsellor in 1937.

As leader in the Lords, Snell took a strong line against the growing threat of fascism, and attacked the Government&#x27;s appeasement of Nazi Germany and its refusal to intervene to help the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War. He also continued to champion Zionism. During a debate in the Lords in 1938 he spoke in support of the policy of population transfer of Arabs in Palestine for the purposes of developing the land and creating cohesive settlements, pointing out that similar transfers had occurred in Libya and other Arab countries without any protest. Aged seventy-five and with his health failing, he stood down as leader of the Labour peers in 1940. However, he recovered and was appointed by Winston Churchill as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (Deputy Leader of the House of Lords) a year later (having been considered as Leader, but passed over in favour of a Conservative). He chaired several committees and inquiries during the Second World War, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1943. Whilst still in the role of Deputy Leader, Snell fell ill at the end of March 1944, and died less than a month later, his peerage becoming extinct at that time.

His humanist funeral was conducted by his friend H.J. Blackham, where Clement Attlee was among the mourners in a private ceremony.

<doc id="742629" wikidata="Q360754" url="?curid=742629" title="Lacrosse (satellite)">
<text>Lacrosse or Onyx was a series of terrestrial radar imaging reconnaissance satellites operated by the United States National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). While not officially confirmed by the NRO or the Government of the United States prior to 2008, there was widespread evidence pointing to its existence, including one NASA website. In July 2008, the NRO itself declassified the existence of its synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation.

According to former Director of Central Intelligence Admiral Stansfield Turner, Lacrosse had its origins in 1980 when a dispute between the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Air Force as to whether a combined optical/radar reconnaissance satellite (the CIA proposal) or a radar-only one (the USAF proposal) should be developed was resolved in favor of the USAF.

Lacrosse uses synthetic aperture radar as its prime imaging instrument. It is able to see through cloud cover and also has some ability to penetrate soil, though there have been more powerful instruments deployed in space for this specific purpose. Early versions are believed to have used the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) to relay imagery to a ground station at White Sands, New Mexico. There are some indications that other relay satellites may now be available for use with Lacrosse. The name &quot;Lacrosse&quot; is used to refer to all variants, while &quot;Onyx&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the three newer units.

Unit costs (including launch) in 1990 dollars are estimated to be in the range of US$0.5 to 1.0 billion.

== Future ==
It had been anticipated that the Lacrosse satellites would be replaced by the radar component of the Future Imagery Architecture (FIA). The severe program problems encountered by FIA in the early 2000s (decade) led to a plan to off-load radar reconnaissance to the Space Based Radar, later simplified to Space Radar, with initial launch anticipated around 2015. This program itself was axed by Congress late 2008. The launch of NROL-41 (USA 215) in September 2010 has all orbital characteristics of a radar remote sensing platform (see FIA) and could be the first of a Lacrosse follow-up program. Its orbit is a retrograde version of the &quot;frozen&quot; Lacrosse orbit, the choice for a retrograde orbit itself indicating a SAR role.

==Launches==

Five Lacrosse spacecraft have been launched, with none currently in orbit. The Lacrosse move in orbital planes either 68° or 57° inclined. These orbital inclinations of 68° and 57°, combined with their altitude give the satellites a complete view of the Earth&#x27;s surface, including the north and south poles. Lacrosse 5 appears to differ somewhat from the previous four satellites. As determined by amateur observers, there are subtle differences in its orbit, and its color is somewhat whiter than the distinct red-orange tint of the earlier ones. Most strikingly, it sometimes fades from brightness to invisibility within the space of a few seconds while still in full sunlight. (Amateur observers call this rapid fade its &quot;disappearing trick&quot;, although it appears to be an accidental phenomenon due to the design of the craft and not a deliberate stealth feature.)


==In pop culture==
The story of the 1994 Andy Sidaris film &quot;The Dallas Connection&quot; involves a series of codes necessary to control a Lacrosse reconnaissance satellite.

The plot of the 2018 Hindi movie &quot;&quot; involves a Lacrosse satellite as the US intelligence eye in the sky.

<text>Over the Edge is a 1979 American coming-of-age film directed by Jonathan Kaplan and released in May 1979. The film, based on actual events, had a limited theatrical release but has since achieved cult film status. It was Matt Dillon&#x27;s film debut.

==Plot==
In Colorado&#x27;s planned community of New Granada, Carl, Richie, and Claude hang out at &quot;The Rec&quot;, an adult-supervised venue where teenagers can socialize. One afternoon, as The Rec closes, Carl and Richie are confronted by Police Sergeant Doberman, who suspects they perpetrated a freeway sniping incident. After questioning at the station, they are both released to their parents. The next day, Carl meets and befriends Cory, a new arrival, who expresses mild rejection at the idea they date. (&quot;I don&#x27;t go out on dates,&quot; she says.) That evening, after learning from his father of the community&#x27;s plans to nix construction of an amusement center, he walks to a local park, where he hooks up with Richie. Together, they relocate to a nearby house party. But when police arrive to squelch the fun, Carl walks home alone and is assaulted by Mark, the real instigator of the freeway sniping.

Meantime, attempts by Carl&#x27;s father to entice out-of-town investors to New Grenada are thwarted by Carl, who booby-traps their car. Later, Carl and Ritchie accompany Cory and other kids on a picnic. They take along a pistol, which Cory stole during a break-in. For fun, they alternate shooting tin cans until they run out of ammo. Claude, recently arrested for possession of hash, explains that the local neighborhood pusher, a fellow student named Tip, sold it to him. But when Cory reveals Tip&#x27;s recent coincidental arrest, the kids pay him a visit. Under interrogation, Tip confesses he told Doberman about giving Claude hash. Richie, Carl, and Claude dump him into a pond as Tip&#x27;s mother watches in horror from a nearby tennis court. Her descriptions of Carl and the others leads to panic. Richie steals his mother&#x27;s car, and he and Carl flee. It all ends tragically as Doberman chases them down. Richie produces a gun and aims it at Doberman, who fires in self-defense. Richie dies.

The next day, Carl sneaks home and overhears his mother on the phone discussing a community meeting at the school that night. Carl sneaks back out to notify his friends. They decide to confront the parents there. But when police show up, locking their weapons inside their cars, the meeting turns into a nightmare. The kids chain the school&#x27;s doors, light fireworks, and proceed to trash the parking lot. Then they break into patrol cars, pull out police shotguns, and blow up several vehicles, igniting fires all around. When reserve police finally arrive, the kids disperse. Doberman apprehends Carl, but Mark, the freeway sniper, shoots Doberman&#x27;s car, causing it to crash and catch fire. Carl pulls himself free, leaving the unconscious Doberman inside the car. He perishes in a massive explosion. When next seen, Carl and others are being herded onto a school bus and driven away. From atop an overpass, Cory and Claude wave goodbye to Carl, as the bus makes its way to a juvenile detention facility.

== Production ==
The film was inspired by events described in a 1973 &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; article entitled &quot;Mousepacks: Kids on a Crime Spree&quot; by Bruce Koon and James A. Finefrock, which reported on young kids vandalizing property in Foster City, California. The middle class planned community had an unusually high level of juvenile crime. Screenwriters Charles S. Haas and Tim Hunter began work shortly after the article&#x27;s publication, including field research in the town itself where they interviewed some of the kids. Hunter said that the script accurately reflected the article with the exception of a more violent ending.

Orion Pictures helped finance the film; producer George Litto borrowed an additional $1 million. Director Jonathan Kaplan, who was just 30 when hired, took a documentary approach to filming and hired unknown actors. Among them was Matt Dillon, then age 14, whom the filmmakers discovered in a middle school in Westchester County, New York. This was Dillon&#x27;s feature film debut. Shooting took place over 20 days in 1978 in the Colorado cities of Aurora and Greeley.

== Filming locations ==
The filming took place in Aurora, Colorado and Greeley, Colorado. John Evans Junior High school was used as New Granada School and was razed in 2015. The east side of John Evans School, Cafetorium, metal shop parking lot, athletics storage building (not in picture), library and science classrooms were featured in the film. New Granada scenes were filmed around the Colorado city of Aurora, Colorado, as well as the Cherry Creek State park and reservoir.

== Release ==
Due to the negative publicity surrounding a wave of recent youth gang films such as &quot;The Warriors&quot;, &quot;The Wanderers&quot;, and &quot;Boulevard Nights&quot;, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; was given a limited theatrical release in 1979. It debuted on May 18, 1979 in eight cities in the United States on a test run basis, with the biggest release in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In a 1978 interview between Eddie Van Halen and journalist Steve Rosen where the Van Halen guitarist discusses the song &quot;Light Up the Sky,&quot; he explained, &quot;Warner Bros. is financing some movie, and they wanted us to write the theme song for it and we were thinking of using that song.&quot; While not mentioning the movie by name, Van Halen later describes it as &quot;A neat movie - everyone&#x27;s going to relate to that. It&#x27;s high school kids up north in New Granada, some new housing development. They destroy everything, they lock it...they had a PTA meeting, because all the parents were getting together to talk about their problems they were having with all the students and kids destroying the town. And then while all the people were in there, they lock them in, they chain the doors with all the cops inside and stuff. They went out and started smashing the cars and blowing everything up - it was insane...It was supposed to be a true story. So I think maybe the title of that kind of sprung from that. Because it was a real trippy movie, and it would be a good title calling it &#x27;Light Up the Sky.&#x27; Because the last scene of the movie was heavy, boy - it’s just a big flash of flame type of thing.&quot; Ultimately, the band opted not to give the song to the film, because Van Halen says in the same interview, &quot;We went and saw a screening of the flick...and it ain&#x27;t gonna win no Academy Award or nothing.&quot; Instead, the song was included on the album &quot;Van Halen II&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Over the Edge&quot; has an approval rating of 85% based on 13 critics&#x27; reviews.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the movie a positive review, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s to Mr. Kaplan&#x27;s credit that he makes New Granada look just as boring and alienated to us as it does to the unfortunate children who live there.&quot; Roger Ebert said the film&#x27;s &quot;violent climax is particularly unconvincing,&quot; but the movie captures the &quot;feeling of teen-age frustration and paranoia...and the rhythms of teen-age life...how kids talk and feel and yearn, about the maddening sensation of occupying a body with adolescent values but adult emotions.&quot; Ebert concluded the film &quot;does an uncanny job of portraying these kids in a recognizable, convincing way.&quot; Both Ebert and Gene Siskel were mixed on an episode of the movie review series &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;. The performances of Dillon, Michael Kramer, and Pamela Ludwig were also praised by critics.

Richard Labonté of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; wrote, &quot;The strength of &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, and what set it apart...from most of the gang films of the late &#x27;70s, was Kaplan&#x27;s ability to portray more than merely juvenile violence: his kid actors trash their school with the best of them, but the seething reasons for their behavior is discussed and explored and assessed, rather than merely exploited...capturing with discretion and with discernment the anger of suburban sterility and the dependence on the deadening effect of dope.&quot;

The film has since gained cult film status. In late 1981, it was shown at &quot;Film at Joseph Papp&#x27;s Public Theater&quot; as part of &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, a program devoted to films that had been overlooked because of poor marketing or distribution. This screening led to it being listed on critical top-10 lists, and it was favorably reviewed by Vincent Canby at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The film then re-emerged in the 1980s with showings on cable, including HBO and a videocassette release in 1989.

In a 2000 review for The Austin Chronicle, Mike Emery said the film is &quot;a vibrant depiction of confused teen life.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote, &quot;Director Jonathan Kaplan has a fine feel for the crushing blandness of &#x27;planned communities&#x27;—the anger that possesses his underage heroes proceeds from a physically oppressive emptiness, represented by rows of hollow town houses and vast, blasted fields. Part wish fulfillment and part social moralizing, the film never resolves its point of view, but a few of the apocalyptic images stay in the mind.&quot;

A novelization of the film by Charlie Haas and Tim Hunter was published by Grove Press alongside the film&#x27;s release. Included in the book are 32 pages of photographs from the shooting of the film. The book is long out of print.

Director Richard Linklater has said &quot;Over the Edge&quot; influenced his 1993 film &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. &quot;Over the Edge&quot; also partly inspired the music videos for the songs &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana and &quot;Evil Eye&quot; by Fu Manchu.

In 2021, entertainment website &quot;Yardbarker&quot; named &quot;Over the Edge&quot; the “signature film” of the city of Denver.

<doc id="742643" wikidata="Q419059" url="?curid=742643" title="Bethanechol">
<text>Bethanechol is a parasympathomimetic choline carbamate that selectively stimulates muscarinic receptors without any effect on nicotinic receptors. Unlike acetylcholine, bethanechol is not hydrolyzed by cholinesterase and will therefore have a long duration of action. Bethanechol is sold under the brand names Duvoid (Roberts), Myotonachol (Glenwood), Urecholine (Merck Frosst), and Urocarb (Hamilton). The name &quot;bethanechol&quot; refers to its structure as the ur[[Bethanechol|ethane]] of beta-methylcholine.

== Medical uses ==

Bethanechol alleviates dry mouth and is sometimes given orally or subcutaneously to treat urinary retention resulting from general anesthetic, diabetic neuropathy of the bladder, or a side effect of antidepressants; or to treat gastrointestinal lack of muscular tone. The muscarinic receptors in the bladder and gastrointestinal tract stimulate contraction of the bladder and expulsion of urine, and increased gastrointestinal motility, respectively. Bethanechol should be used to treat these disorders only after mechanical obstruction is ruled out as a possible cause.

Its potential benefit in the treatment of cerebral palsy has been investigated.

Atropine is given preoperatively to prevent voiding of the bowel/bladder during surgery; then, bethanechol is given postoperatively to revert this action.

== Contraindications ==

Use of bethanechol, as well as all other muscarinic receptor agonists, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, coronary insufficiency, peptic ulcers, intestinal obstruction and hyperthyroidism. The parasympathomimetic action of this drug will exacerbate the symptoms of these disorders.

<doc id="742660" wikidata="Q5875496" url="?curid=742660" title="Hockaday School">
<text>The Hockaday School is an independent, secular, college preparatory day school for girls Pre-K through 12 located in Dallas, Texas, United States. The Hockaday School is accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest.

==History==
The school was founded in 1913 by Ela Hockaday in response to a group of Dallas businessmen&#x27;s demand to pioneer an academic institution for their daughters, one equal to that of their sons’ educational experiences. She added a junior college in 1931 which operated until 1951. The first class consisted of only ten students. Sarah Trent was one of the first teachers at the school and was influential in its development. As of the 1940 census, Ela Hockaday was living at the school that was located in the block between 5601 Bonita and 2407 Greenville Avenue in Dallas.

The school announced in 2021 that it would phase out the boarding option by 2025.

==Tuition==
The tuition averages $36,705 for upper school day students (not including books). For resident students, costs are approximately $62,828 - $64,191. Financial aid is granted on the basis of demonstrated family need and the school&#x27;s availability of funds. In the 2019–2020 school year, 13% of the Hockaday student body received financial aid.

==Athletics==
Hockaday competes in the Southwest Preparatory Conference (SPC) in 11 sports: basketball, cross-country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.

In addition, they compete in crew (rowing) and fencing.

== Publications ==
Hockaday&#x27;s mass communication publications are student-run and designed. They produce the newspaper, Fourcast, once a month and the literary magazine, &quot;Vibrato&quot;, once a year.

&quot;Vibrato&quot; has won national awards, including the Gold Crown Award (CSPA), Pacemaker Award (NSPA), and Best in Show (NSPA), through Columbia Scholastic Press Association and National Scholastic Press Association.

==Notable alumnae==

Since 2010, five Hockaday graduates have gone to graduate school at Oxford as Rhodes Scholars, an award that goes to only 32 students per year. Two Hockaday alumnae earned this scholarship in 2022, becoming the first two Rhodes Scholars from the same high school graduating class. These 5 alumnae are: Libby Longino Cohen ’06, Laura Roberts ’12, Mary Clare Beytagh ’14, Elizabeth Guo &#x27;18, and Mary Orsak &#x27;18

<doc id="742665" wikidata="Q153046" url="?curid=742665" title="Mutatis mutandis">
<text>Mutatis mutandis is a Medieval Latin phrase meaning &quot;with things changed that should be changed&quot; or &quot;once the necessary changes have been made&quot;, literally: having been changed, going to be changed. It continues to be seen as a foreign-origin phrase (and thus, unnaturalized, meaning not integrated as part of native vocabulary) in English and is therefore usually italicized in writing. It is used in many countries to acknowledge that a comparison being made requires certain obvious alterations, which are left unstated. It is not to be confused with the similar &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, which excludes any changes other than those explicitly mentioned. &quot;Mutatis mutandis&quot; is still used in law, economics, mathematics, linguistics and philosophy. In particular, in logic, it is encountered when discussing counterfactuals, as a shorthand for all the initial and derived changes which have been previously discussed.
==Latin==
The phrase &#x27;—now sometimes written &#x27; to show vowel length—does not appear in surviving classical literature. It is Medieval Latin in origin and the Feet of fines, kept at The National Archives (United Kingdom), contains its first use in England on January 20, 1270, at Pedes Finium, 54 Hen. III, Salop.

Both words are participles of the Latin verb &#x27; (&#x27;to move; to change; to exchange&#x27;). &#x27; is its perfect passive participle (&#x27;changed; having been changed&#x27;). &quot;&quot; is its gerundive, which functions both as a future passive participle (&#x27;to be changed; going to be changed&#x27;) and as a verbal adjective or noun expressing necessity (&#x27;needing to be changed; things needing to be changed&#x27;). The phrase is an ablative absolute, using the ablative case to show that the clause is grammatically independent (&#x27;absolute&#x27; literally meaning &#x27;dissolved&#x27; or &#x27;separated&#x27;) from the rest of the sentence.

==English==
&quot;Mutatis mutandis&quot; was first borrowed into English in the 16th century, but continues to be italicized as a foreign phrase. Although many similar adverbial phrases are treated as part of the sentence, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot; is usually set apart by commas or in some other fashion. The nearest English equivalent to an ablative absolute is the nominative absolute, so that a literal translation will either use the nominative case (&quot;things changed which are to be changed&quot;) or a preposition (&quot;with the things to be changed having been changed&quot;). More often, the idea is expressed more tersely (&quot;with the necessary changes&quot;) or using subordinating conjunctions and a dependent clause (&quot;once the necessary adjustments are made&quot;).

The phrase has a technical meaning in mathematics where it is sometimes used to signal that a proof can be more generally applied to other certain cases after making some, presumably obvious, changes. It serves a similar purpose to the more common phrase, &quot;without loss of generality&quot; (WLOG).

The legal use of the term is somewhat specialized. As glossed by Shira Scheindlin, judge for the Southern District of New York, for a 1998 case: &quot;This Latin phrase simply means that the necessary changes in details, such as names and places, will be made but everything else will remain the same.&quot; In the wake of the Plain English movements, some countries attempted to replace their law codes&#x27; legal Latin with English equivalents.

===Examples===
* &quot;I believe the soul in Paradise must enjoy something nearer to a perpetual vigorous adulthood than to any other state we know. At least that is my hope. Not that Paradise could disappoint, but I believe Boughton is right to enjoy the imagination of heaven as the best pleasure of this world. I don&#x27;t see how he can be entirely wrong, approaching it that way. I certainly don&#x27;t mind the thought of your mother finding me a strong young man. There is neither male nor female, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, it would be a fine thing. That &quot;mutandis&quot;! Such a burden on one word!&quot;—Marilynne Robinson, &quot;Gilead&quot;.
*&quot;To illustrate the point with trivial stereotypical examples from British society: just as male heterosexuals are free to enjoy themselves playing rugby, drinking beer and talking about girls with their mates, so male homosexuals are to be free to enjoy themselves going to Kylie concerts, drinking exotically coloured cocktails and talking about boys with their straight female mates. &quot;Mutatis mutandis&quot;—and in many cases the adaptations would obviously be great—the same must apply to other societies. In other words, gay men are to be as free as their straight equivalents in the society concerned to live their lives in the way that is natural to them as gay men, without the fear of persecution.&quot;—Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, &quot;HJ and HT v Home Secretary&quot;, British Supreme Court, 2010

==Other languages==
The phrase appears in other European languages as well. A passage of Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; includes &quot;...j&#x27;ai le fils d&#x27;un de mes amis qui, mutatis mutandis, est comme vous...&quot; (&quot;A friend of mine has a son whose case, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, is very much like yours.&quot;) The German Ministry of Justice, similar to the Plain English advocates above, now eschews its use. Their official English translation of the Civil Code now reads:

&quot;Section 27 (Appointment of and management by the board). ...(3) The management by the board is governed by the provisions on mandate in sections 664 to 670 &quot;with the necessary modifications.&quot;&quot;

==In popular culture==
The phrase is used as the motto of Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men Marvel Comics.

<text>Carbachol, also known as carbamylcholine and sold under the brand name Miostat among others, is a cholinomimetic drug that binds and activates acetylcholine receptors. Thus it is classified as a cholinergic agonist. It is primarily used for various ophthalmic purposes, such as for treating glaucoma, or for use during ophthalmic surgery. It is generally administered as an ophthalmic solution (i.e., eye drops).

Carbachol produces effects comparable to those of sarin if a massive overdose is administered (as may occur following industrial and shipping accidents) and therefore it is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Chemistry and pharmacology ==
Carbachol is a choline carbamate and a positively charged quaternary ammonium compound. It is not well absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and does not cross the blood–brain barrier. It is usually administered topical ocular or through intraocular injection. Carbachol is not easily metabolized by cholinesterase, it has a 2 to 5 minute onset of action and its duration of action is 4 to 8 hours with topical administration and 24 hours for intraocular administration. Since carbachol is poorly absorbed through topical administration, benzalkonium chloride is mixed in to promote absorption.

Carbachol is a parasympathomimetic that stimulates both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. In topical ocular and intraocular administration its principal effects are miosis and increased aqueous humour outflow.

In the cat and rat, carbachol is well known for its ability to induce rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when microinjected into the pontine reticular formation. Carbachol elicits this REM sleep-like state via activation of postsynaptic muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs).

A recent review indicates that carbachol is a strong promoter of ICC activity, which is mediated through the calcium-activated chloride channel, anoctamin 1.

===Synthesis===
Carbachol may be prepared in a 2 step process beginning with the reaction of 2-chloroethanol with urea to form a 2-chloroethyl-carbamate, which is then quaternised by a reaction with trimethylamine.

== Indications ==
Carbachol is primarily used in the treatment of glaucoma, but it is also used during ophthalmic surgery. Carbachol eyedrops are used to decrease the pressure in the eye for people with glaucoma. It is sometimes used to constrict the pupils during cataract surgery.

Topical ocular administration is used to decrease intraocular pressure in people with primary open-angle glaucoma. Intraocular administration is used to produce miosis after lens implantation during cataract surgery. Carbachol can also be used to stimulate bladder emptying to treat the condition of underactive bladder.

In most countries carbachol is only available by prescription. Outside the United States, it is also indicated for urinary retention as an oral (2 mg) tablet.

== Contraindications ==
Use of carbachol, as well as all other muscarinic receptor agonists, is contraindicated in patients with asthma, coronary insufficiency, gastroduodenal ulcers, and incontinence. The parasympathomimetic action of this drug will exacerbate the symptoms of these disorders.

== Overdose ==
The effects of a systemic overdose will probably be similar to the effects of a nerve agent (they both act on the cholinergic system, increasing cholinergic transmission), but its toxicity is much weaker and it is easier to antagonize in overdose. When administered ocularly there is little risk of such effects, since the doses are much smaller (see topical versus systemic administration).

<text>L&#x27;Assomption () is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada on the L&#x27;Assomption River. It is the seat of the Regional County Municipality of L&#x27;Assomption. It is located on the outer fringes of the Montreal urban area.

Most of the economy depends on the agricultural industries of the surrounding plains. It is also the cultural centre of the region.

==History==

In 1647, the L&#x27;Assomption Seignory was granted to Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny, named after the river already named such since the seventeenth century. Between 1640 and 1700, a settlement formed inside a large horseshoe-shaped meander of the L&#x27;Assomption River. Amerindians had already been visiting this site since ancient times and called it &quot;Outaragasipi&quot; meaning winding river, in reference to the river&#x27;s course. They would drag their canoes across the peninsula as a short-cut for the meander, and therefore the settlement was first called Le Portage.

In 1717, the parish was formed, known thereafter as Saint-Pierre-du-Portage-de-l&#x27;Assomption and also as Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul-du-Portage. In 1766, the village saw an influx of Acadian settlers. Between 1774 and 1888, L&#x27;Assomption was the most prosperous and important town between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres.

In 1845, the L&#x27;Assomption Municipality was established, abolished in 1847, but reestablished as a parish municipality in 1855. In 1846, the village itself became a separate Village Municipality and obtained town status in 1888.

In 1992, the town and parish municipality were merged again, and on July 1, 2000, the neighbouring Parish Municipality of Saint-Gérard-Majella was amalgamated with Ville de L&#x27;Assomption.

In December 2010, the 1,300-worker Electrolux factory announced that it would close, relocating to Memphis, Tennessee.

<text>Dekasegi (, , ) is a term that is used in Latin America to refer to people, primarily Japanese Brazilians and Japanese Peruvians, who have migrated to Japan, having taken advantage of Japanese citizenship or &quot;nisei visa&quot; and immigration laws to work short-term in Japan.

The original Japanese word roughly translates as &quot;working away from home&quot;. This can cause irritation to those of Japanese descent who were born abroad, but have come to regard Japan as their permanent home and therefore object to being regarded by Japanese (in Japan) as &quot;gaijin&quot; or foreigners.

There are approximately 200,000 such people in Japan from Brazil alone.

==Language==
Some Brazilians are bilingual in Japanese and Portuguese, but many are monolingual in Portuguese alone when they first come to Japan and face additional challenges due to this language barrier.
Many code-switch to Japanese when speaking Portuguese.

<text>Valga County ( or &quot;Valgamaa&quot;) is a first-level administrative unit and one of 15 counties of Estonia. It comprises the former area of Valga District. The present-day county was created on 1 January 1990. The capital and largest town of Valga County is Valga, followed by Tõrva and Otepää. It is situated in the southern part of the country and borders Põlva and Võru County to the east, Latvia to the south and west, and Viljandi and Tartu County to the north. 27,650 people live in Valga County as of 2022.

== General ==
Valga County is located in the southern part of Estonia. By the economic-geographical and regional-political distribution it belongs to the area of South-East Estonia (together with Põlva and Võru County). By historical ties and landscape the county belongs to the region of South Estonia (together with Põlva, Võru, Viljandi, Tartu and Jõgeva Counties). With a population of 30,176 people (as of 1 January 2014), the total area of the county is 2,043.53 km2 (2,046.49 km2 together with the area of Võrtsjärv), it reaches 65 km in the north–south direction and 59 km in the east–west direction. Valga County ranks the 12th in Estonia by population and the 14th by the area.

The distances from the county centre, Valga, are the following: Tallinn 267 km, Tartu 86 km, Viljandi 88 km, Võru 73 km, Põlva 96 km, Pärnu 141 km, Narva 264 km and Riga 157 km.

Valga County borders with Viljandi County in the north-west, with Tartu County in the north and Põlva and Võru County in the east. Valga County has a borderline with the Republic of Latvia in the south and west (102.4 km).

== History ==

=== Medieval Period ===
It can be read from the Livonian Chronicle of Henry that the history of the county goes back to the 13th century when the Germans conquered the settlement. By the Chronicle the Ümera River was the borderline between Estonia and Latvia. Historians suggest that the Säde River was the borderline, flowing through the northern part of Tireli Bog and falling into Lake Burtnieks. Meadows and forests surrounding the big Tireli Bog and the upper stream of the River Säde were probably even wider and impassable at that time and therefore functioning perfectly as a border.

The ancient (13th century) national border ran in a totally different place. Assumably the area of Härgmäe belonged to Estonian settlements and the national border went from the springs of the River Säde, passed the forests until the northernmost oxbow of the Koiva River and onwards alongside the river. Most likely the area of Kaagjärve and Valga Town belonged to ancient Latgalians.

After the crusades and the Ancient Freedom Fight in the 13th century, Valga County became a natural centre of the historical Old Livonia where the most important roads from north, south and east went through, gaining strategical importance.

=== Early Modern Period ===
City rights were given to Valga by a Polish King Stefan Batory in 1584.

On the 3rdof July, 1783, the Empress Catherine II established a new administration order in the Baltic provinces. A new kreis (county), Valga Kreis, was constituted mainly from the territories of Riga and Võnnu Kreises. Valga Town which formerly belonged to Riga Kreis, went over to Valga Kreis. Valga Kreis consisted of eleven parishes, nine of them located on the present Latvian territory, and just two – Luke (Lugaži in Latvian, Luhde in German) and Härgmäe (Ērģeme in Latvian, Ermes in German) – had an edge on the present Estonian area, mostly near Valga, which became an attraction centre of the new kreis.

In 1789, there were 891 citizens in Valga. As Valga became the centre of the kreis, Valga St. John&#x27;s Church was founded and also the building of kreis institutions was built in 1783-1786 (later it became a prison).

=== Recent history ===
On 12 February 1919, the Government of the Republic of Estonia issued a regulation of constitution of Valga County, consisting of the territories gained during the Estonian War of Independence. Several parts of Võru, Tartu and Viljandi Counties were close to Valga from the other side. On 19 April the first county governor was elected – Johann Kurvits, a farmer of Karula. He held this position until July 1921, when August Sild followed his position.

Until the 1920s the surroundings of Härgmäe and Valga belonged to the mixed area of Estonia-Latvia as there was no exact national border. Half of the citizens were Latvians, the other half were Estonians. In 1920 the national border was fixed and that helped to differentiate between the nations. Valga Kreis was divided so that Estonia got the areas of Paju and Sooru Manors and the majority of Valga (where the citizens were mostly Estonians), the rest belonged to Latvia.

==== Independence ====
Valga County, almost in its present shape, was formed on 6 September 1920 when the course of the War of Independence and the situation at that time required Valga&#x27;s separation from the other counties.

On 11 February 1921 the Estonian Government fixed the area of Valga County. Võru County gave Kaagjärve, Karula, Laanemetsa and Taheva parishes, Tartu County gave Tõlliste, Laatre, Sangaste, Keeni and Kuigatsi parishes, Viljandi County gave Jõgeveste, Patküla, Koorküla, Taagepera, Leebiku, Helme, Lõve and Hummuli parishes. Later on, several administrative territorial changes were carried through. In 1921 Patküla parish was separated from Holdre parish and Tõrva borough. Puraküla, which formerly belonged to Paju parish was united to the town of Valga in 1922. In 1924 Paju parish was united to Sooru parish and on 2 July 1926, it started to bear the name Tõrva. Since the second half of the 1920s until 1939 there were 19 parishes in Valga County.

In 1939 many smaller parishes were united by the administrative reform. Ten parishes were left: Helme, Hummuli, Kaagjärve, Karula, Kuigatsi, Põdrala, Sangaste, Taheva, Tõlliste and Vaoküla.

==== World War II and occupation ====

The last pre-occupation County Governor Värdi Vellner had to give up his power on 8 July 1940. Nevertheless, the administrative division of 1939 lasted until 1950 when 39 county districts were formed. They were divided into 636 village soviets.

The present territory of Valga County was divided into three parts: Valga, Tõrva and Otepää districts. In 1952 the oblasts of Tallinn, Tartu and Pärnu were formed on the territory of the Estonian SSR.

In 1959 the liquidation of smaller districts began. Antsla, Otepää and Tõrva districts were liquidated. Tõrva and the village soviets of Haabsaare, Helme, Koorküla, Mõniste, Riidaja and Taagepera were united to Valga district. Otepää town and the village soviets of Otepää and Pühajärve were united to Elva district. In 1961 Mõniste was united to Võru district.

The next year, in 1962, Otepää and the village soviets of Aakre, Otepää and Palupera were reunited with the Valga District. One year later, some areas of the Põlva District were united with the Valga District. In 1966, the area of Valtina was added and thus the final border of the Valga District was fixed.

In December 1989, the chairman of the former Executive Committee of the Valga District, Uno Heinla, was elected as the inaugural county governor following Estonia&#x27;s reestablished independence. On 22 February 1990, the RSN Executive Committee of the Valga District was reorganized and it became the Valga County Government.

==== Regaining independence ====
After Estonia regained its independence, there were three towns (Valga, Tõrva and Otepää) and 11 parishes formed in Valga County: Helme, Hummuli, Karula, Õru, Palupera, Põdrala, Pühajärve, Puka, Sangaste, Taheva and Tõlliste. On 1 January 1999, the town of Otepää and Pühajärve Parish were merged and a new Otepää Parish was formed. Despite that, the town of Otepää kept holding the town rights, but is officially part of the rural municipality (parish).

== County government ==
The County Government (Estonian: &quot;Maavalitsus&quot;) is led by Governor (Estonian: &quot;maavanem&quot;), who is appointed by the Government of Estonia for a term of five years. Currently the Governor position is held by Margus Lepik.

== Municipalities, settlement and population ==
There are 3 local municipalities in Valga County including Valga (county capital), Tõrva, Helme, Hummuli, Karula, Otepää, Palupera, Puka, Põdrala, Sangaste, Taheva, Tõlliste and Õru Parishes.

=== Demographical indicators ===
As of 1 January 2014, the population of Valga County was 30,176 – 47.5% of men and 52.5% of women. 14.93% were minors (age 0-14), 62.65% were at working age (age 15–64) and 22.41% were at retirement age (65 and older). 82.63% of the population were Estonians and 12.51% were Russians. The population density was 14.8 ppl/km2. Since 2004 the population of the county has decreased by 4154 people. The main reason besides the natural negative population growth is the mechanical growth – the people who have left the county.
== Religion ==

The largest number of congregations in the county are of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church.

Orthodox congregations in the county are predominantly under the jurisdiction of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church.

Several congregations of Baptists, a catholic congregation in Valga and other Christian churches operate in the county.

== Geography ==

=== Relief ===
The landscape of Valga County is various. The western part is located in the south-eastern part of Sakala Upland where the moraine plain is being varied by old valleys, some hills and ridges. In the northern part the landscape is characterized by small drumlins, the low and wet areas are covered with meadows and forests. The surrounding area of Tõrva-Helme is flatter but separated by the River Õhne and the valleys of its tributaries (Valley of Tikste). In many places the sandstone of the substrate can be seen on the hillsides. The territory is quite densely populated. The farmlands are varied by meadows, lakes and a few patches of forest. In the southern part, around Hummuli and Taagepera, some rolling hills can be found.

In the southern part of the county, there is a large sandy area with big forests, moorlands and bogs. In the middle part of the county the valley of the River Väike-Emajõgi runs from north to south. It is continued by Valga Basin with mainly flexuous moraine landscape, cut through by low valleys or basin valleys. The most noticeable is the valley of the River Väike-Emajõgi where Pedeli Valley flows into. In the middle part of Valga Basin there is a large boggy meadow of Korva. Larger farmlands are mainly situated around Sangaste and Laatre.

The most various and highest part of the county is located around Otepää. The highest peaks are Kuutsemägi Hill (217 m), Meegaste Hill (214 m) and Harimägi Hill (212 m). The moraine landscape is varied by low rolling hills and many lakes, the biggest and the best-known lake is Pühajärv. On the edge areas of the upland the difference between the edges is small but the relief is strongly differentiated. To the south-east of Valga Basin, Karula Hills can be seen heading from the west to the east. The eastern part of the hills has especially varied relief. Heading to the west, the relief becomes lower and changes into lower hills continuing in the Latvia. There are many lakes in Karula. The best-known lake is Karula Pikkjärv and it is located on the northern edge of Karula Hills.

Hargla Basin is located in the southern part of the county. It is a mildly flat area between the uplands with some lonely moraine hills. The Valleys of Koiva River and Mustjõe River together with the Aheru Lake form a very picturesque area.

The area of forest land of the county is almost 114,000 hectares, which forms 56.7% of the area of Valga County. Pine and spruce are the main species. Forests are differentiated by meadows, moorlands, everglades and bogs. 7,900 hectares of the total area are covered with bogs, of which 5,400 hectares are moorlands. The largest bogs are Rubina and Korva Bog.

=== Lakes and rivers ===
Valga County has many lakes. Most of them are located in Otepää Upland, on the area of Karula Hills and on the catchment area of Õhne River. There are more than 180 natural lakes with the area of more than one hectare and with the total area of 17 km2. 
The biggest lake is 
Pühjärv (286 ha),

followed by Lake Aheru (234 ha). The southern part of Lake Võrtsjärv, with the area of 300 hectares, is also included within the borders of Valga County. Most of the lakes are quite shallow and not deeper than 10 m. The deepest lakes in the county are Udsu (30.2 m) and Petajärv (25 m), both located on the territory of Koorküla Lakes where the old valleys have been filled by the sediments from the Ice age. There are four official swimming places – the beach of Riiska Lake and Vanamõisa Lake in Tõrva, the beach of Lake Pühajärv in Otepää and the beach on the sides of Pedeli River in Valga.

The fish fauna of the lakes is quite changeable as many fish die during cold winters because of shallow water. Species such as whitefish, bream, pike, and perch die because of a lack of oxygen. There may be more than ten species of fish in some lakes.

There are more than 30 artificial lakes with the area of one hectare and with the total area of 100 ha, 20 of which being used publicly. The biggest artificial lake is Puide Reservoir on Jõku River (11.5 ha).

The best-known river of the area is Väike-Emajõgi, starting from Lake Pühajärv and falling into Lake Võrtsjärv, flowing fully on the territory of Valga County. Another important river is Pedeli, which flows through Valga and is the biggest tributary of the River Emajõgi. The River Õhne is flowing through Tõrva and the Jõku River is the tributary of the Õhne River. The River Mustjõgi flows through the south-eastern corner of the county towards Võru County.

=== Nature protection ===
The territory under nature protection composes around 20% of the whole territory of Valga County. The most important nature objects under protection are Otepää Nature Park, Karula National Park and Koiva-Mustjõe Landscape Conservation Area. There are 60 different protection areas such as national parks, nature protection areas, landscape protection areas and their sub-types such as parks, stands and arboretum. The biggest one in Valga County and also in Estonia is Otepää Nature Park with the area of 22,430 ha. The territory under protection, also including nature reserves and permanent habitats form the area of 43,431 ha.

There are 28 indigenous trees and 5 glacial boulders under protection as a single object. The highest tree under protection is Tsuura spruce and it is also the largest spruce in Estonia – the height of 29 m and the circumference of 4.32 m. The thickest tree, Pühajärv War Oak, has the circumference of 6.98 m. The biggest glacial erratic of South Estonia is located in Valga County – Helgikivi with the circumference of 30.2 m and with the volume above the land of 61 m³.

=== Substrate ===
The substrate of the county is formed by Devonian sandstones which are quite porous, rich in micas and slightly cemented. Light-coloured sandstones from the Middle Devonian Burtniek stage, clay and marl layers are spread on the majority of the territory of the county. On the narrow stripe of the county&#x27;s northern part, the sandstones of the Middle Devonian Aruküla Stage become visible. They are cross-bedded with the interlayers of siltstones, clays and dolomites.

The substrate is covered by the complex of quaternary sediments (glacial, limno-glacial and fluvio-glacial). Moraine is dominant on the area of the northern and middle parts of the county. Gravels, sands, loams and bog sediments are diverged. The geological construction of the substrate is complicated (thickness is varying 10–100 m and more). The surface water lies at the depth of 0–10 m, on the hills even deeper. From the aspect of engineering geology, the ground of the county is mostly of good load-capacity, but the relief can be an obstacle for construction works.

== Economy ==
Valga County is an area of industry and agriculture but also an area of a well-known recreation and sports centre Otepää. The average gross salary in Valga County in 2013 was €729 (compared to the average salary in Estonia in 2013 – €949)

<text>Võru County ( or &quot;Võrumaa&quot;; ) is a county in southern Estonia. It is bordered by Valga and Põlva counties, Latvia&#x27;s Alūksne and Ape municipalities, and Russia&#x27;s Pskov Oblast (making it the only Estonian county to border two countries).

The territory of Võrumaa covers and is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. In 2022, Võru County had a population of 34,182, 2.6% of the total population in Estonia. The county is subdivided into 12 rural municipalities and one urban municipality, the county capital, Võru.

== Ethnic division and culture ==

In Võru County, there are 95.3% Estonians, 3.3% Russians, and 1.4% other nationalities. Two indigenous ethnic groups live in Võru County – the Võro people and the Setos. Both ethnic groups have their own language (Võro, Seto) and cultural heritage in traditions.

=== Võro people ===
The Võro Institute is established for the preservation and promotion of the Võro language and culture, which are tightly connected with its historic centre, the rural and mostly agricultural South-Eastern Estonian county of Võromaa.

The Võro Institute was founded by the Estonian government in 1995. The institute is engaged in a wide range of activities, including establishing school programs, conducting linguistic and regional research, preserving place-names and their corresponding stories, publishing Võro-language scholarship and school textbooks, and organizing annual language conferences etc. The aim of these activities is to encourage the Võro people to speak their own language and to preserve their characteristic life-style.

In 2014, the smoke sauna tradition in Võrumaa was added to the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage. Smoke saunas along with sauna rituals are a part of traditional life and cultural heritage of the Võro people. A smoke sauna is an old-fashioned rural sauna, which has no chimney.

=== Setos ===
The purpose of the Seto Institute is to coordinate and promote research in the field of the Seto region and the Seto culture and to introduce the results of the research to the public. The Seto Institute publishes papers, organizes events and organizes education in the field of Seto culture in cooperation with other organizations in the Seto region. In 2009, the Setos’ polyphonic style of folk singing, called leelo, was added to the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage. Believed to be at least 1,000 years old, leelo is considered a special local variant of the Baltic-Finnic runo song tradition.

== Religion ==

The Lutheran congregations in the county are under the Võru Deanery of the South Estonian Diocese of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church: in Võru, Pindi, Roosa, Rõuge, Urvaste and Vastseliina. 

Eastern Orthodox congregations in the county are under the jurisdiction of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church. 

Several congregations of Baptists, and other Christian churches operate in the county.

== Economy ==

The county&#x27;s main economic sectors are forestry and wood processing, furniture and food industry and also tourism. According to statistics of 2011, there are 1852 SMEs in Võru County. 47% of enterprises in the county belong to primary sector (agriculture, forestry), 38% of enterprises work in tertiary sector (trade, services) and 15% of enterprises are involved in secondary sector (processing industry). The biggest foreign owned companies based in Võru County are AS Toftan (wood processing), AS Barrus (wood processing), AS Antsla Inno (furniture production), AS Rauameister (metal processing), AS Võru Juust (food processing) and Danpower GmbH (energy production).

The county enjoys an advantageous location due to its relative proximity to Pskov in Russia (100 km) and Riga in Latvia (220 km). Accessibility is provided by several transport corridors running through the county. One of the most important transit routes in Estonia, Tallinn-Tartu-Pskov, passes the county. The South-East corner of the county is crossed by the Riga-Pskov-St Petersburg major road. The county is strategically placed on trade routes between the East and West.

== Education ==
The county has 23 schools with approximately 1500 pupils. One vocational school, Võru County Vocational Training Center, offers 33 different practical curriculums in various levels for 600 students.

== Culture and events ==
Võrumaa is a distinctive region bearing the culture of Võro and Seto.

Smaller sub-areas are tightly covered with community centres, libraries, museums and sport centres. Larger cultural and sport facilities are Võru Culture Center Kannel, Võrumaa Central library, Võro Institute, the Vana-Võromaa Culture House and the Võrumaa Sport Centre.

There are many traditional and non-traditional cultural and sport events taking place in the county, which are organized by different associations and non-profit organizations. The cultural landscape is shaped by events such as Võru Folk Festival, song festival Uma Pido, Ostrova Festival of traditional Seto and modern pop music, food fair UMA MEKK, unique Lindora fair, Võhandu International Canoeing Marathon, Haanja Ski Marathon, Rõuge Boar Race, and many more.

==History==

Võrumaa in its historical borders (Võro: &quot;Vana Võromaa&quot;) included eight parishes: Karula, Hargla, Urvaste, Rõuge, Kanepi, Põlva, Räpina and Vastseliina.

These parishes are currently centered (due to redistricting) in Võru and Põlva Counties with parts extending into Valga and Tartu Counties.

From 1944 to 1953, the Estonian Forest Brothers (anti-Soviet partisans) were most active in Võru County.

==County government==
Võru County Government (&quot;Maavalitsus&quot;) is a regional government agency, directed by the County Governor (&quot;maavanem&quot;), who represents the national interests in the county and is responsible for the balanced and comprehensive development of the county. The County Governor is appointed to the office by the Government of Estonia for a 5-year term, on the proposal of the Minister of Regional Affairs. Since 2010 the Governor position is taken by Andres Kõiv.

==Municipalities==
Today Võru County consists 5 municipalities that work together to facilitate the county&#x27;s balanced and sustainable development. 5 municipalities are divided for one urban - Võru - and 4 rural municipalities (&quot;vallad&quot; - parishes) - Antsla, Rõuge, Setomaa, Võru. In Võru County there are two towns (&quot;linnad&quot; - Võru and Antsla) and approximately 570 villages.

Former rural municipalities:
*Antsla Parish (&quot;includes the town of Antsla&quot;)

<text>The IBM Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator or CPC was announced by IBM in May 1949. Later that year an improved machine, the CPC-II, was also announced.

IBM&#x27;s electronic (vacuum tube) calculators could perform multiple calulations, including division.

The card-programmed calculators used fields on punched cards not to specify the actual operations to be performed on data, but which &quot;microprogram&quot; hard-coded onto the plugboard of the IBM 604 or 605 calculator machine; a set of cards produced different results when used with different plugboards. The units could be configured to retain up to 10 instructions in memory and perform them in a loop.

The original CPC Calculator has the following units interconnected by cables:
*Electronic Calculating Punch
**IBM 604 with reader/punch unit IBM 521
*Accounting Machine
**IBM 402 or
**IBM 417

The CPC-II Calculator has the following units interconnected by cables:
*Electronic Calculating Punch
**IBM 605 with punch unit IBM 527
*Accounting Machine
**IBM 407 or
**IBM 412 or
**IBM 418
*&quot;Optional&quot; Auxiliary Storage Units (up to 3)
**IBM 941, each could store 16 decimal numbers with ten digits plus sign.

From the IBM Archives:
The IBM Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator was announced in May 1949 as a versatile general purpose computer designed to perform any predetermined sequence of arithmetical operations coded on standard 80-column punched cards. It was also capable of selecting and following one of several sequences of instructions as a result of operations already performed, and it could store instructions for self-programmed operation. The Calculator consisted of a Type 605 Electronic Calculating Punch and a Type 412 or 418 Accounting Machine. A Type 941 Auxiliary Storage Unit was available as an optional feature. All units composing the Calculator were interconnected by flexible cables. If desired, the Type 412 or 418, with or without the Type 941, could be operated independently of the other machines. The Type 605 could be used as a Calculating Punch and the punch unit (Type 527) could be operated as an independent gang punch.

Customer deliveries of the CPC began in late 1949, at which time more than 20 had been ordered by government agencies and laboratories and aircraft manufacturers. Nearly 700 CPC systems were delivered during the first-half of the 1950s.

<doc id="742731" wikidata="Q1095906" url="?curid=742731" title="Claro M. Recto">
<text>Claro Mayo Recto Jr. (February 8, 1890 – October 2, 1960) was a Filipino lawyer, jurist, writer, poet, author, columnist, and statesman who was the primary author of the 1935 Philippine Constitution, and a senator of the Philippines from 1931 until his death in 1960. Known as the &quot;Father of the Philippine Constitution&quot;, the &quot;Great Dissenter&quot;, and &quot;Great Academician&quot;, he is remembered as a political maverick in the early Philippine government, a key figure in Philippine independence from the United States, a fierce opponent of U.S. neocolonialism in Asia in his later years, and as a staunch nationalist throughout his career.

Recto began his political career as the representative for the 3rd District of Batangas from 1919 to 1928, where he emerged as the most prominent member of the Democrata Party. He was elected as a senator to the 10th Philippine Legislature, where he opposed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, and later became president of the 1934 Philippine Constitutional Convention that drafted the 1935 Constitution. Recto and future president Manuel L. Quezon personally presented the constitution to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who also appointed Recto as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines—the last to be appointed by the United States.

At the height of World War II, Recto was detained by the United States on charges of collaboration with the Japanese, but was nonetheless reelected to the Senate in 1941 with the highest number of votes among the 24 elected senators. He joined the KALIBAPI party during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, and served in President Jose P. Laurel&#x27;s wartime cabinet. Recto was faced with treason and collaboration charges at the end of the war, but refused the amnesty issued by President Manuel Roxas, chose to defend himself in court instead, and was ultimately acquitted of all charges.

He was reelected to the Senate in 1949 and in 1955, becoming an outspoken critic of continued American influence in Asia, and of Presidents Elpidio Quirino and Ramon Magsaysay, the latter of whom he decried as a “banana dictator” and “American puppet&quot;. Following Magsaysay&#x27;s death in 1957, Recto was among several members of the NP who left the party in discontent with President Carlos P. Garcia. Recto established the Nationalist Citizens&#x27; Party with Lorenzo Tañada later that year and became its candidate in the 1957 presidential election, but lost.

In 1960, he was appointed by Garcia as Cultural Envoy with the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. He mysteriously died of a heart attack on October 2 that same year, in Rome, while on a diplomatic mission to Spain. It is widely believed that the United States Central Intelligence Agency may have a hand in his death.

He is the father of former Batasang Pambansa assemblyman Rafael Recto, and grandfather of Secretary of Finance Ralph Recto.

==Early life and education==
Recto was born in Tiaong, Tayabas (now known as Quezon province), Philippines, of educated, upper middle-class parents, Claro Recto Sr. of Rosario, Batangas, and Micaela Mayo of Lipa, Batangas. He studied Latin at Instituto de Rizal in Lipa, Batangas, from 1900 to 1901. He continued his education at Colegio del Sagrado Corazón of Don Sebastián Virrey and finished his secondary education in 1905 at the age of 15. He moved to Manila to study at Ateneo de Manila where he consistently obtained outstanding scholastic grades, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree &quot;maxima cum laude&quot; in 1909. He received a Masters of Laws degree from the University of Santo Tomás. He later received a Doctor of Laws degree honoris causa from Central Philippine University in 1969.

Recto married Ángeles Silos y Jamora on 10 February 1912.

== House of Representatives (1916–1928) ==
Recto launched his political career as a legal adviser to the first Philippine Senate in 1916. In 1919, he was elected representative from the second district of Batangas.

Recto joined Juan Sumulong&#x27;s opposition party, the Partido Democrata National (Democrata Party), and was its candidate for the office of Speaker of the House in the 1922 elections. The party won 25 seats, but Recto was defeated by the Nacionalista-Colectivista candidate Manuel Roxas, and instead became House Minority Floor Leader until 1925.

=== 1924 Philippine Independence Mission ===

On July 17, 1923, all Filipino members of Governor-General of the Philippines Leonard Wood&#x27;s cabinet and Council of State resigned en masse in the so-called &quot;1923 Philippine Cabinet Crisis&quot;, following prolonged tensions over Wood&#x27;s &quot;autocratic&quot; actions. The Democrata Party accepted Wood&#x27;s stance on the crisis, for which then-Senate President Manuel L. Quezon labeled them as &quot;traitorous&quot; during the special senatorial election of 1923.

Meanwhile, when news of the crisis reached Washington in early 1924, support for Philippine autonomy surged in the 68th United States Congress, and a flood of congressional resolutions and bills ranging from immediate Philippine independence to complete autonomy with an option for freedom were introduced.

By March, a bill by Indiana Representative Louis W. Fairfield gained the most popularity. It proposed a commonwealth with an elected Filipino leader, a 25-year transition period, continued U.S. military bases, and American control over foreign relations, debt, and defense until full independence. Support for the bill proved overwhelming, though the rapid pace alarmed both the Coolidge administration and Filipino leaders. Wood was urged to publicly oppose Congress&#x27;s hasty push for independence, to no avail.Likewise, Quezon and senator Sergio Osmeña felt that—although Congress had meant well—the bill&#x27;s terms were unsatisfactory and it was being advanced too quickly. They launched the 1924 Philippine Independence mission to the United States in an attempt to delay the Fairfield bill.

To ensure bipartisan support, Quezon invited Recto to join the mission, along with Osmeña and Resident Commissioners of the Philippines Isauro Gabaldon and Pedro Guevara. They arrived in early May, and after a private meeting between Quezon and US Secretary of War John W. Weeks, the Fairfield bill was successfully delayed. In the same year, Recto was admitted to the American Bar.

However, Recto, despite not being present at the meeting, had somehow acquired key documents of the exchange, and in November 1924 revealed that Quezon had accepted terms falling short of full independence. In doing this, Recto attempted to position the Democratas as defenders of immediate independence, and take political revenge for Quezon&#x27;s insult in 1923.

Recto&#x27;s plot backfired, however, as Quezon and Osmeña managed to rally the legislature to their version of events. They insisted that they had rejected the Fairfield bill outright and would accept only full independence or continued &quot;slavery&quot; under American rule.

He again vied for the title of House Speaker in the 1925 elections, but would be defeated by Roxas once more, who was now under the newly-reunited Nacionalista Party.

=== Hiatus and return to politics ===
In 1928, Recto temporarily retired from politics and dedicated himself to the teaching and practice of law, joining the Guevara, Francisco, &amp; Recto law firm. He would later call the world of academia &quot;restrictive and soporific&quot; and reentered politics in 1931. 

== Senator of the Philippines (1931–1960) ==
=== First term (1931–1935) ===
He was elected senator from the Fifth Senatorial District in the 1931 Senate elections but simultaneously lost his bid for Senate President against the incumbent Quezon. Recto would go on to serve as the Senate Minority Floor Leader until 1934, becoming known as the &quot;one-man fiscalizer&quot; during this period. Recto switched to the Nacionalista Party in the 1934 senate elections, and was subsequently elected Senate Majority Floor Leader.

==== Philippine independence (1934–1941) ====

The 1931 OsRox mission culminated in the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act (1933), which established the Philippine Commonwealth as a transition government for 12 years and promised the country full independence on July 4, 1946. However, the act would also have required the Philippines to exempt American goods from customs duties, and essentially allowed the indefinite retention of U.S. military and naval bases in the Philippines, as well as American imposition of high tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports such as sugar and coconut oil.

Opposition sparked in response to the controversial provisions, with the ruling Nacionalista Party dividing into two factions pending the act&#x27;s ratification: Recto joined Quezon&#x27;s faction (dubbed the &quot;Antis&quot;) who opposed the act, and Osmeña&#x27;s faction (the &quot;Pros&quot;), who supported it. In the end, the Philippine Legislature rejected the Act.

Quezon headed another Philippine Independence mission to the US in 1934, securing instead the passage of the Tydings–McDuffie Act, which established the Commonwealth as the transitional government of the Philippines, specified a framework for the drafting of a constitution, detailed a number of mandatory constitutional provisions, and required approval of the constitution by the U.S. President and by Filipinos. Prior to independence, the act allowed the U.S. to maintain military forces in the Philippines and to call all military forces of the Philippine government into U.S. military service. Finally, the act mandated U.S. recognition of independence of the Philippine Islands as a separate and self-governing nation after a ten-year transition period.

==== 1934 Philippine Constitutional Convention ====
Recto presided over the assembly that drafted the Philippine Constitution in 1934–35 in accordance with the provisions of the Tydings–McDuffie Act and a preliminary step to independence and self-governance after a 10-year transitional period. He was the primary author of the constitution, thus becoming known as the &quot;Father of the Philippine Constitution.&quot;

Together with Quezon, who was later elected the first president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, Recto personally presented the 1935 Constitution to United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt. The consensus among many Philippine political scholars of today judges the 1935 Constitution as the best-written Philippine charter ever in terms of prose.

=== Associate Justice ===
He was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines on July 3, 1935, by President Roosevelt, and would be the last Associate Justice appointed by the United States, holding the position until November 1, 1936.

=== World War II (1939–1945), second term (1941-1946) ===
During World War II, Recto was arrested by the US colonial government for collaboration charges with the Japanese. Despite this, he ran for senator in the 1941 senatorial elections and reaped 1,084,003 votes, the highest number of votes among the 24 elected senators. However, Imperial Japan would invade on December 8, 1941, preventing the elected senators from taking oath. Thus, they were not seated until 1945.

By 1943, the Commonwealth established a government-in-exile in Washington, DC; however many politicians stayed behind and collaborated with the occupying Japanese, among them Recto and then-Minister of Interior José P. Laurel. The Japanese installed Laurel as the President of the Second Philippine Republic on October 14, 1943. Recto was appointed as Commissioner of Education in 1942, and as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1943 to 1944. As Minister, he signed the Philippine-Japanese Treaty of Alliance alongside Japanese Ambassador to Philippines Sozyo Murata on October 20, 1943.

==== Post-World War II ====

After the war, Recto, along with Laurel, Minister of Education Camilo Osías, and Senator Quintín Paredes, was taken into custody and tried for treason, but he successfully defended himself was acquitted. He wrote a defense and explanation of his position in &quot;Three Years of Enemy Occupation&quot; (1946), which convincingly presented the case of the &quot;patriotic&quot; conduct of the Filipino elite during World War II.

=== Third term (1949–1955) ===

On April 9, 1949, Recto attacked against the unfair impositions of the U.S. government in the &quot;Military Bases Agreement&quot; of March 14, 1947, and later in the &quot;Mutual Defense Treaty&quot; of Aug. 30, 1951, and especially the &quot;Tydings Rehabilitation Act&quot;, which required the enactment of the controversial parity-rights amendment to the constitution. He debated against U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. on the question of U.S. ownership of military bases in the Philippines.

Recto was reelected to the Senate on November 8, 1949.

=== Fourth term (1955–1960) and final years ===
In his later years, Recto denounced the influence and coercion of the Catholic Church on voters&#x27; decisions—the Philippines having a 90% Catholic majority at the time. In a 1958 article in &quot;The Lawyer&#x27;s Journal,&quot; Recto suggested a constitutional amendment to make the article on the separation of church and state clearer and more definitive. He also argued against the teaching of religion in public schools.

He was reelected to his fourth and final term in the Senate in 1955.

Recto also foresaw the demands of a fast-moving global economy and the challenges it would pose. In a speech on the eve of the 1957 presidential election, he petitioned all sectors of society and implored Philippine youth:
The first task to participate seriously in the economic development of our country (is to) pursue those professions for which there is a great need during an era of rapid industrialization. Only a nationalistic administration can inspire a new idealism in our youth, and with its valid economic program make our youth respond to the challenging jobs and tasks demanding full use of their talents and energies.

Recto was a staunch critic of the Magsaysay administration, especially with the Laurel-Langley Agreement. This led to his expulsion from the Nacionalista Party. He would then lose the election to incumbent president Carlos P. Garcia, winning just 8 percent of the vote. Garcia later appointed Recto as Cultural Envoy with the rank of Ambassador on a cultural mission to Europe and Latin America in 1960.
== Other activities ==
=== Legal practice ===
Recto was known as an &quot;abogado milagroso&quot; (lawyer of miracles), a tribute to his many victories in the judicial court. He wrote a three-volume book on civil procedures, which, in the days before World War II was standard textbook for law students.

His prominence as a lawyer paralleled his fame as a writer. He was known for his flawless logic and lucidity of mind in both undertakings.

Recto took part in many landmark cases. In &quot;Hall v. Piccio&quot; (G.R. No. L-2598), the landmark civil case involving Articles of Incorporation as a requisite to becoming a de facto corporation, Recto lost the case to Ramon Diokno and his son Jose W. &quot;Ka Pepe&quot; Diokno. Recto and the former later collaborated and won in &quot;Nacionalista Party v. Felix Angelo Bautista&quot;, against Felix Angelo Bautista, then the Solicitor-General of the Philippines.

=== Writing ===
He was reared and schooled in the Spanish language, his mother tongue alongside Tagalog, and he was also fluent in English. He initially gained fame as a poet while a student at University of Santo Tomás when he published a book &quot;Bajo los Cocoteros&quot; (Under the Coconut Trees, 1911), a collection of his poems in Spanish. A staff writer of &quot;El Ideal&quot; and &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, he wrote a daily column, &quot;Primeras Cuartillas&quot; (First Sheets), under the pen name &quot;Aristeo Hilario.&quot; They were prose and numerous poems of satirical pieces. Some of his works still grace classic poetry anthologies of the Hispanic world.

Among the plays he authored were &quot;La Ruta de Damasco&quot; (The Route to Damascus, 1918), and &quot;Solo entre las sombras&quot; (Alone among the Shadows, 1917), lauded not only in the Philippines, but also in Spain and Latin America. Both were produced and staged in Manila to critical acclaim in the mid-1950s.

In 1929, his article &quot;Monroismo asiático&quot; (Asiatic Monroism) validated his repute as a political satirist. In what was claimed as a commendable study in polemics, he proffered his arguments and defenses in a debate with Dean Máximo Kálaw of the University of the Philippines where Kálaw championed a version of the Monroe Doctrine with its application to the Asian continent, while Recto took the opposing side. The original Monroe Doctrine (1823) was U.S. President James Monroe&#x27;s foreign policy of keeping the Americas off-limits to the influence of the Old World, and states that the United States, Mexico, and countries in South and Central America were no longer open to European colonization. Recto was passionately against its implementation in Asia, wary of Japan&#x27;s preeminence and its aggressive stance towards its neighbors.

In his deliberation, he wrote about foreseeing the danger Japan posed to the Philippines and other Asian countries. His words proved prophetic when Japan invaded and colonized the region, including the Philippines from 1942 to 1945.

His eloquence and facility with the Spanish language were recognized throughout the Hispanic world. The &quot;Enciclopedia Universal&quot; says of him: &quot;Recto, more than a politician and lawyer, is a Spanish writer, and that among those of his race&quot; (although he had Irish and Spanish ancestors), &quot;there is not and there has been no one who has surpassed him in the mastery of the language of his country&#x27;s former sovereign.&quot;

==Death==
Recto died of a heart attack in Rome, Italy, on October 2, 1960, while on a cultural mission to Spain, where he was to fulfill a series of speaking engagements. His body was flown back to the Philippines to be buried in Manila North Cemetery.

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency is suspected of involvement in his death. Recto, who had no known heart disease, met with two mysterious Caucasians in business suits before he died. that a plan to murder Recto with a vial of poison was discussed by CIA Chief of Station Ralph Lovett and the US Ambassador to the Philippines Admiral Raymond Spruance years earlier.

==Legacy==

Recto is referred to by some as the &quot;Great Academician&quot; or the &quot;finest mind of his generation&quot;. Teodoro M. Locsín of &quot;Philippines Free Press&quot;, defined Recto&#x27;s genius:Recto is not a good speaker, no. He will arouse no mob. But heaven help the one whose pretensions he chooses to demolish. His sentences march like ordered battalions against the inmost citadel of the man&#x27;s arguments, and reduce them to rubble; meanwhile his reservations stand like armed sentries against the most silent approach and every attempt at encirclement by the adversary. The reduction to absurdity of Nacionalista senator Zulueta&#x27;s conception of sound foreign policy was a shattering experience, the skill that goes into the cutting of a diamond went into the work of demolition. There was no slip of the hand, no flaw in the tool. All was delicately, perfectly done... Recto cannot defend the indefensible, but what can be defended, he will see to it that it will not be taken.

Critics claim that Recto&#x27;s brilliance is overshadowed by his inability to capture nationwide acceptance. His lack of popularity frequently saw him at the bottom of senate votes, and he sometimes lost the senate elections. He was seen as out of touch with the poor, and only garnered less than nine percent of votes when he ran for the presidency in 1957. His appeal was limited to the intellectual elite and the nationalist minority of his time, though others argue that he was just too ahead of his time.

Political editorialist Manuel L. Quezon III, laments:Recto&#x27;s leadership was the curious kind that only finds fulfillment from being at the periphery of power, and not from being its fulcrum. It was the best occupation suited to the satirist that he was. His success at the polls would be limited, his ability to mold the minds of his contemporaries was only excelled by Rizal&#x27;s... But he was admired for his intellect and his dogged determination to never let the opposition be bereft of a champion, still his opposition was flawed. For it was one that never bothered to transform itself into an opposition capable of taking power.

 During the 1957 presidential campaign, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) conducted black propaganda operations to ensure his defeat, including the distribution of condoms with holes in them and marked with `Courtesy of Claro M. Recto&#x27; on the labels.

<text>The DDR-Oberliga (English: &quot;East German Premier League&quot; or &quot;GDR Premier League&quot;) was the top-level association football league in East Germany.

==Overview==
Following World War II, separate sports competitions emerged in the occupied eastern and western halves of Germany, replacing the &quot;Gauligas&quot; of the Nazi era.

In East Germany, a top-flight football competition, the highest league in the East German football league system, was established in 1949 as the DS-Oberliga (&quot;Deutscher Sportausschuss Oberliga&quot;, German Sports Association Upper League). Beginning in 1958, it carried the name DDR-Oberliga and was part of the league structure within the DFV (&quot;Deutscher Fussball-Verband der DDR&quot;, German Football Association of the GDR).

In its inaugural season in 1949/50, the DDR-Oberliga was made up of 14 teams with two relegation spots. Over the course of the next four seasons, the number of teams in the division varied and included anywhere from 17 to 19 sides with three or four relegation spots. Beginning with the 1954/55 season up until merger of the East and West German football associations in 1991/92 the league was made up of 14 teams with 2 relegation spots.

Initially, the DDR-Oberliga operated on an autumn-spring schedule, as was traditional in Germany. From 1956 to 1960, a Soviet-style spring-autumn (calendar year) schedule was in place. This required a transition round in 1955 and, although no champion was formally declared that season, SC Wismut Karl-Marx-Stadt finished atop the division. 1961/62 saw the return of an autumn-spring season and an extended schedule (39 matches vs. 26 matches) was played with each club meeting the others a total of three times – once at home, once away, and once at a neutral venue.

After German reunification, the last regular DDR-Oberliga season was played in 1990/91 under the designation NOFV-Oberliga (Nordostdeutsche Fußballverband Oberliga or Northeast German Football Federation Premier League). The following year, the East German league structure was merged into the West German system under the German Football Association (&quot;Deutscher Fussball Bund&quot;) and the top two NOFV-Oberliga clubs – FC Hansa Rostock and Dynamo Dresden – joined the first division Bundesliga.

For the duration of the league&#x27;s existence, the league below it was the DDR-Liga.

==Disbanding of the Oberliga==
The Oberliga was disbanded after the 1990–91 season and its clubs were integrated in the German football league system. The fourteen Oberliga clubs went to the following leagues, spread over three tiers:

To the Fussball-Bundesliga (Tier I):
*1. FC Dynamo Dresden
*FC Hansa Rostock

To the 2. Bundesliga Nord (Tier II):
*BSV Stahl Brandenburg

To the 2. Bundesliga Süd (Tier II):
*1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig
*Chemnitzer FC
*FC Carl Zeiss Jena
*FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt
*Hallescher FC

To the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (Tier III):
*FC Berlin
*Eisenhüttenstädter FC Stahl
*FC Vorwärts Frankfurt/Oder

To the NOFV-Oberliga Mitte (Tier III):
*1. FC Magdeburg
*FC Energie Cottbus

To the NOFV-Oberliga Süd (Tier III):
*FC Sachsen Leipzig

==The Oberliga reformed as the Regionalliga Nordost==
In 1994, a new third tier division was established in the area that formerly made up East Germany. The Regionalliga Nordost was made up of most of the big names of the DDR-era alongside clubs from West Berlin. The only clubs from the final season of the old DDR-Oberliga not to appear here were FC Hansa Rostock, which was competing at the Bundesliga level, and Hallescher FC, which had fallen on hard times.

The league was disbanded again in 2000 and its member clubs were spread between the two remaining Regionalligas (III) and the NOFV-Oberligas (IV), effectively ending the history of the all-East German leagues.

The Regionalliga Nordost returned in 2012/13 as one of five fourth-tier regional leagues. The new league will cover the area of the former GDR and Berlin and the champions of this new division will qualify for a play-off against the winner of another Regionalliga or against the second-placed team in the Regionalliga Südwest to determine promotion to the 3. Liga.

==DDR-Oberliga champions==
BFC Dynamo was the league record holder with 10 DDR-Oberliga titles to its credit, having won all of these titles in successive seasons.



;Notes
==Placings in the DDR-Oberliga 1975–1991==
&quot;Clubs are named by the last names they carried before the German reunification, which are not necessarily their current ones.&quot;
* 1 BSG Chemie Leipzig (since May 1990 named &quot;FC Grün-Weiß Leipzig&quot;) and BSG Chemie Böhlen merged in August 1990, to form FC Sachsen Leipzig.
* 2 The club would continue as SV Merseburg 99 (de) following German reunification. SV Merseburg 99 merged with &quot;VfB IMO Merseburg&quot; in 2019 to form 1. FC Merseburg (de).

<doc id="742736" wikidata="Q2388162" url="?curid=742736" title="Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century">
<text>Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century is an animated television series in which Sherlock Holmes is brought back to life in the 22nd century. The series is a co-production by DIC Entertainment, L.P. and Scottish Television Enterprises and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Special Class Animated Program.

== Development ==
The series was conceptualized by Sandy Ross, a Scottish Television executive, while skiing in Aspen, Colorado in January 1996. DIC Productions and Scottish Television, who had previously collaborated on other series, produced the show. Some issues were raised about language carrying different connotations between cultures, but alternative action and dialogue were used to overcome this. The series was originally planned to be called &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 21st Century&quot;, but as the planned air date of September 1998 was near the new century, the show&#x27;s name was changed.

Les Studios Tex was also confirmed to be working on the series, although they are not credited in the final product.

==Plot==
Set during 2103 in New London, Inspector Beth Lestrade of New Scotland Yard is chasing the grotesquely deformed French rogue geneticist Martin Fenwick, when she realizes that his companion is none other than the 19th-century criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty. She then discovers that this is not the original Moriarty, but rather a clone created from cells taken from his corpse, which Sherlock Holmes had buried in a Swiss ice cave after Moriarty&#x27;s death in 1891. Lestrade knows that Holmes died of natural causes many years later and that his corpse is preserved in a glass-walled, honey-filled coffin in the basement of New Scotland Yard. She takes the body from the basement and delivers it to biologist Sir Evan Hargreaves (who resembles Holmes&#x27; creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle), who has just invented a process of cellular rejuvenation. Hargreaves uses his process to return life and youth to Holmes&#x27;s body so that the detective can again battle Moriarty. Holmes also returns to his old Baker Street rooms, which had been preserved as a museum. Lestrade&#x27;s compudroid reads the original journals of Dr. John H. Watson and assumes his name, face, voice, and mannerisms in order to assist Holmes in both his crime-solving duties and his difficult assimilation to Great Britain in the 22nd century.

During the series, Holmes and Watson often work on retainer for New Scotland Yard, with Beth as their supervising officer and Chief Inspector Charles Grayson as hers, but they also work for private citizens. They are often assisted by the new Baker Street Irregulars: the football player Wiggins, the Cockney Deidre, and the paraplegic Tennyson, who communicates through electronic beeps (which Holmes understands after learning about 22nd-century advances in technology and Morse code). The primary villains are Moriarty and Fenwick (whom Moriarty has manipulated into being his loyal henchman), appearing as they do in almost half of the produced episodes.

Each episode is inspired by one of the literary works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Many of these are direct rewrites of the original stories—such as &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;, &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot;, &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, and &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot;—while others are drastically different from the stories on which they are based.

Visually, the series is a blend of traditional 2D and 3D CGI animation.

==Voice cast==
* Jason Gray-Stanford as Sherlock Holmes: The Great Detective himself, Holmes was brought back in the 22nd century to combat a memory clone of his nemesis, Professor Moriarty. Despite initial trouble with adapting to the era, he eventually acclimatizes quite nicely, learns to love this new era he has been bought to, and uses his knowledge of the future to often help his allies out of death traps. Holmes has taken to playing a hand-sized keytar in place of his classic violin. He commonly uses the phrase &quot;eyes and brain&quot; to encourage thinking or explain his reasoning.
* John Payne as Watson: A compudroid that initially worked as Lestrade&#x27;s assistant. He later read the original Dr. John H. Watson&#x27;s journals, and Lestrade unknowingly made breakthroughs in a lot of areas that day. He was able to emulate his persona from them, which led to other breakthroughs. While not able to feel emotions as a human would eventually develop and learn how, Watson can vocalize and react realistically. In public, Watson dons a cloak to better fit in. He currently resides at 221B Baker Street with Holmes.
* Akiko Morison as Inspector Beth Lestrade: A descendant of Inspector G. Lestrade, Holmes&#x27; old ally from Scotland Yard. Often annoyed with Holmes&#x27; constant disregard for protocol, she nonetheless appreciates his continued help, despite direct orders from Grayson. Holmes likewise respects Lestrade as an extremely competent officer, more competent than her ancestor.
* Viv Leacock as Wiggins: The leader of the new Baker Street Irregulars. Wiggins was once a football player, but has since retired from the profession due to an injury. He has shown intelligence and reasoning skills that were enough to impress even Holmes. Wiggins is dedicated to follow Holmes&#x27; requests of the Irregulars.
* Jennifer Copping as Deidre: Another of the Irregulars, who is a fashionable young woman with a Cockney accent. In contrast to the more outlandish rest of the cast, she provides the perspective of a more typical member of New London society. 
* Richard Ian Cox as Tennyson: Another member of the new Baker Street Irregulars, who was left mute and partially paralyzed due to an accident. He is an expert in the arcades and gaming, and a genius and brilliant mind on a computer and keyboard. 
* Richard Newman as Professor James Moriarty: A memory clone of the original created by Fenwick, hoping to use him as a brilliant servant. However, Moriarty was able to outwit Fenwick and reverse the roles on him, taking this new lease on life to re-create his old criminal empire. Though Moriarty constantly fails, largely due to fallout of his schemes not having the same debilitating impact as in the 1800s; leaving him with nothing but setbacks. This is also because Sherlock is there. But Sherlock Holmes comes to admit for all intents and purposes he is Moriarty.
* Ian James Corlett as Martin Fenwick: A deformed and insane French scientist who specializes in cloning. He created a clone of Moriarty to do his bidding, but he ended up being reduced to the lackey in their relationship. Whether he does this because he knows that Moriarty could devise a horrible and painful way to dispose of him, or because he has been brainwashed by Moriarty, has never been revealed.
* William Samples as Chief Inspector Charles Grayson: Lestrade&#x27;s superior who distrusts Holmes and is reluctant of him interfering with his cases, due to him being born at a different age.
* Jo Bates as a newscaster who appears on broadcasts in the episodes, which provide clues in much the same way newspapers did in the original stories.

<text>Dolbeau-Mistassini () is a town in northern Quebec, Canada, at the confluence of the Mistassibi River, Riviere aux Rats and the Mistassini River, on Lac Saint-Jean. Dolbeau-Mistassini is in the Maria-Chapdelaine Regional County Municipality and is the commercial hub of Lac-St-Jean with big stores and shopping centres.

The city was formed in 1997 through the amalgamation of the cities of Dolbeau and Mistassini. Dolbeau is located on the right (west) bank of the Mistassini River, in the geographic township of Parent (not in the adjacent Dolbeau Township). The town of Mistassini is on the left (east) bank of the Mistassini River at the confluence with the Mistassibi River, directly opposite Dolbeau.

==History==
The first settler in Mistassini may have been François Gaudreault in 1884. But credit is given to Trappists for founding the town, an exceptional case in Quebec. In 1892, the Trappists of Oka were granted of land between the Mistassini and Mistassibi Rivers by the government of Charles Boucher de Boucherville. They first settled at the mouth of the Mistassibi then on the shores of Lac Saint-Jean. In 1895, the Parish of Saint-Michel-de-Mistassini was founded, and two years later, it was incorporated as a municipality.

In 1930, the town centre of Saint-Michel-de-Mistassini separated from the municipality to form the Village Municipality of Mistassini. During the construction of the Chute-des-Passes Dam on the Peribonka River in 1944, it experienced commercial growth and gained city status in 1947. In 1976, the Municipality of Saint-Michel-de-Mistassini and the Village Municipality of Mistassini were merged again to form the City of Mistassini.

As for Dolbeau, it was founded in 1926 by Swedish-born industrialist Emil Andrew Wallberg and his industrial German-born partner John Stadler who established there the Lake Saint John Power and Paper Co. paper mill. The town, incorporated in 1927, was named after Jean Dolbeau (1586–1652), Récollet missionary in the Tadoussac and Lac Saint-Jean area from 1615 to 1617 and from 1618 to 1620.

On December 17, 1997, the cities of Dolbeau and Mistassini were merged to form the City of Dolbeau-Mistassini.

He is known for his performances in the films &quot;Amores perros&quot; (2000), &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; (2001), &quot;Bad Education&quot; (2004), &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; (2004), &quot;Babel&quot; (2006), &quot;Coco&quot; (2017), &quot;Old&quot; (2021), and &quot;Cassandro&quot; (2023). He has also played music conductor Rodrigo de Souza in the television drama series &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot; (2014–2018), and has starred in the Disney+ special &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; (2022).

García Bernal was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his portrayal of a young Che Guevara in &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; in 2005, and in 2016 won his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy for &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot;. He and fellow actor Diego Luna founded the production company Canana Films in Mexico City. In 2016, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him in the annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 most influential people list. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked him No. 25 in its list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century.

==Early life==
García Bernal was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, the son of Patricia Bernal, an actress and former model, and José Ángel García, an actor and director. His stepfather is Sergio Yazbek, whom his mother married when García Bernal was young. He started acting at just one year old and spent most of his teen years starring in telenovelas. García Bernal and frequent collaborator Diego Luna were friends from childhood in Mexico City.

When he was fourteen, García Bernal taught indigenous people in Mexico to read, often working with the Huichol people. At the age of fifteen, he took part in peaceful demonstrations in support of the Zapatista uprising of 1994.

He began studying philosophy at UNAM, Mexico&#x27;s national university but, during a prolonged student strike, he decided to take a sabbatical to travel around Europe. He then moved to London, and became the first Mexican accepted to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Bernal also attended the European Graduate School toward a master&#x27;s in media and communication.

==Career==

After García Bernal&#x27;s success in soap operas, Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu offered García Bernal a part in his feature directorial debut, &quot;Amores perros&quot; (2000). The film won rave reviews, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

His next role was Alfonso Cuarón&#x27;s &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; (2001), which was a crossover success into American markets and gained him notice on the international stage, becoming the second-highest grossing Spanish language film in the United States. The next year, García Bernal went on to portray Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara in the 2002 TV miniseries &quot;Fidel&quot; and the morally troubled Father Amaro in the Mexican box-office record-breaker &quot;El crimen del Padre Amaro&quot; (2002). García Bernal again portrayed Che Guevara in &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; (2004), an adaptation of a journal the 23-year-old Guevara wrote about his travels across South America. The film broke the box office record set 3 years prior by &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot;, and garnered Bernal a BAFTA nomination in 2005 for Best Performance by an Actor.

He also did some theatre work, during this time, including a 2005 production of &quot;Bodas de Sangre&quot;, by Federico García Lorca, in the Almeida Theatre in London.

García Bernal has worked for acclaimed directors including González Iñárritu, Pedro Almodóvar, Walter Salles, Alfonso Cuarón, Michel Gondry, and Iciar Bollaín, among others. He has taken on roles in English-language films, including the Gondry-directed &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot; and &quot;The King&quot;, for which he earned rave reviews.

García Bernal directed his first feature film, &quot;Déficit&quot; which was released in 2007. He was cast in the 2008 film &quot;Blindness&quot;, an adaptation of the 1995 novel of the same name by José Saramago, winner of the Nobel Prize, about a society suffering an epidemic of blindness. As in the novel, the characters have only descriptions, no names or histories; while director Fernando Meirelles said some actors were intimidated by the concept of playing such characters, With Gael,&#x27; he said, &#x27;I never think about the past. I just think what my character wants. García Bernal again paired with Diego Luna in &quot;Rudo y Cursi&quot; directed by Carlos Cuarón.

García Bernal and Diego Luna own Canana Films. The company recently joined with Golden Phoenix Productions to produce a number of television documentaries about the unsolved murders of more than 300 women in the border city of Ciudad Juarez.

In May 2010, García Bernal did a cameo appearance as himself playing Cristiano Ronaldo in &quot;Ronaldo: The Movie&quot; for the Nike advertisement, Write the Future.

In 2010, he co-directed with Marc Siver four short films in collaboration with Amnesty International. The tetralogy, called &quot;Los Invisibles&quot;, is about migrants from Central America in Mexico, their journey and risks, their hopes, and what they can contribute to Mexico, the US and the world. He directed the movies, did the interviews and also narrates the four short movies. He starred in &quot;Even the Rain&quot; (2010), Spain&#x27;s official entry for the 2011 Academy Awards.

García Bernal narrated &quot;Human Planet&quot; for Hispanic audiences, which premiered on Discovery en Español on 25 April 2011 and aired on Discovery Channel in Latin America on 12 May. For the third time García Bernal appeared with Diego Luna in the American Spanish-language comedy film &quot;Casa de mi padre&quot;, opposite Will Ferrell, where he played a feared drug lord. García Bernal&#x27;s next projects included a film adaptation of José Agustín&#x27;s &quot;Ciudades Desiertas&quot; and the Jon Stewart directorial biopic &quot;Rosewater&quot;, in which he portrayed Maziar Bahari to widespread critical acclaim. He was set to star in the 20th Century Fox reboot Zorro film called &quot;Zorro Reborn&quot;. The script is by Glen Gers, Lee Shipman, and Brian McGeevy.

In April 2014, he was announced as a member of the main competition jury at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.

In June 2014, he began production as the star of the dramatic comedy &quot;Zoom&quot;, directed by Pedro Morelli.

In 2014, he was cast in the lead role of Rodrigo de Souza in the Amazon Studios comedy-drama television series &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot;. His performance in the show was met with rave reviews, earning him a Golden Globe Award in 2016.

In 2016, he starred in two movies that were submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, &quot;Desierto&quot; (Mexico) and &quot;Neruda&quot; (Chile).

In 2017, he was announced as a member of the U.S. Dramatic Jury at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. That same year, he provided the voice of Héctor, an undead trickster and one of the main protagonists of the Pixar animated film &quot;Coco&quot;.

García Bernal founded The Ambulante Documentary Film Festival, which works to bring documentary films to places where they are rarely shown, and helped to create the Amnesty International Short Documentary Series Los Invisibles. For this work, he was awarded the Washington Office on Latin America&#x27;s Human Rights Award in 2011.

In October 2019, García Bernal and Diego Luna announced they were joining the Creative Advisory Board for TV and Film development company EXILE Content along with Adam Grant.

In 2021, García Bernal starred in the M. Night Shyamalan thriller &quot;Old&quot;. In November 2021, Bernal was cast in the Disney+ special &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; by Marvel Studios, based on the comics character of the same name.

In 2024, he starred alongside close friend and frequent collaborator Diego Luna in the Hulu Original miniseries, La Máquina as the eponymous character.

==Personal life==

<doc id="742753" wikidata="Q1029736" url="?curid=742753" title="Agent 212">
<text>Agent 212 is a humorous Belgian comic about a rotund police officer who usually suffers as a result of the people and situations he encounters. Created by writer Raoul Cauvin and illustrator Daniel Kox, the comic debuted in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine on 12 June 1975. The first album of the series was published in 1981 by Belgian publishing house &quot;Dupuis&quot;. To date, 30 comic albums of &quot;Agent 212&quot; have been published by Dupuis in French and Dutch. &quot;Agent 212&quot; is among the best selling French comics, with 66,000 copies for the 25th album in 2006. The series is also popular in Indonesia.

== Structure ==
The &quot;Agent 212&quot; albums are usually about 48 pages. Unlike other Franco-Belgian comic titles such as &quot;Tintin&quot;, &quot;Asterix&quot; and &quot;Lucky Luke&quot;, the &quot;Agent 212&quot; albums do not comprise single stories spanning the length of the book. Instead, each album comprises a number of short and usually unrelated stories, ranging in length from one to five pages, though the lead story in Volume 4 spans 12 pages.

==Main characters==
*Arthur Delfouille (&quot;Agent 212&quot;): His nickname is &quot;Tutur&quot;. This well-meaning, overweight police officer yearns for tranquility but makes a lot of blunders, collecting bumps, bruises and reprimands in the course of his duties. 
*Albert (&quot;Agent 213&quot;): Arthur&#x27;s colleague and partner. 
*Raoul Lebrun: The Police Commissioner. Ill-tempered and impatient, he is often enraged by Arthur&#x27;s maladroitness. He sometimes punishes Arthur by assigning him to traffic police duties.
*Louise Delfouille: Arthur&#x27;s wife. Caring and patient, she usually supports Arthur and defends him from her mother&#x27;s criticism.
*Adrian: A police officer who is Arthur&#x27;s friend.
*Arthur&#x27;s mother-in-law: She has a low opinion of Arthur and is sometimes the victim of his vengeance. First appearance is in Volume 24, over pages 39–42, where she receives frightening anonymous phone calls from Arthur.
*Kiki: Arthur&#x27;s pet chihuahua. First appearance is in Volume 25. Louise buys him to relieve the tedium of being a housewife. Arthur unwittingly squashes the dog and is later embarrassed by its small size, but they become firm friends after Kiki bites Arthur&#x27;s mother-in-law.

== Antagonists ==
*Suicidal Man: An old man whose desperate attempts to kill himself are always foiled by Arthur. He is the main antagonist in Volume 1 and the most recurring antagonist of the series. In Volume 25, it is revealed that he used to be a policeman, which is why he regrets his life and wants to kill himself.
*Drunken Toff: A secondary recurring antagonist of the series. He is immaculately dressed in a top hat, tailcoat and bow tie, but his public inebriation leads to trouble with the police. Introduced in Volume 1 (pages 13–14), he crashes his car during a storm, enabling Arthur to hitch a ride in an ambulance.
*Thief: A major recurring antagonist, who often outsmarts Arthur. In Volume 18 (pages 24–26), he is briefly redeemed when he takes pity on a poor mother and child.

<text>Arthur Avenue is a street in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City, which serves as the center of the Bronx&#x27;s &quot;Little Italy&quot;. Although the historical and commercial center of Little Italy is Arthur Avenue itself, the area stretches across East 187th Street from Arthur Avenue to Beaumont Avenue, and is similarly lined with delis, bakeries, cafes and various Italian merchants.

The Bronx&#x27;s Little Italy has an Italian immigrant heritage that dates back to around the 1910s or 1920s. Arthur Avenue and Morris Park are viewed as the Bronx&#x27;s primary Italian American communities. Other Italian-American communities in the Bronx are the working class and middle-class neighborhoods of Schuylerville, Country Club, Pelham Bay, and sections of Fordham. The avenue itself is named for former U.S. president Chester A. Arthur.

==In popular culture==
Robert De Niro&#x27;s directing debut &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; takes place in the vicinity of Belmont. However, it was largely filmed in Astoria, Queens. The series &quot;Third Watch&quot; was based on Arthur Avenue initially, with the first episode referring to the firehouse as &quot;Camelot,&quot; based on its location at the intersection of King Street and Arthur Avenue. The 1973 film &quot;The Seven-Ups&quot; starring Roy Scheider was filmed on Arthur Avenue and Hoffman Street. In 2003, a scene from the HBO hit series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; was shot in Mario&#x27;s restaurant, which had been the planned site of a mob hit in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, which was turned down by the owner of the restaurant 

Leonard of James Frey&#x27;s &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; grew up in this area. Much of the novel &quot;Underworld&quot; takes place near Arthur Avenue. The author himself, Don DeLillo, grew up there.

The opening scene of the 1955 film, &quot;Marty&quot; shows Arthur Avenue. The film&#x27;s main character, Marty Piletti, works at a meat market on Arthur Avenue, and in the movie he considers buying it from its owner.

Early scenes in the mid-1960s film, &quot;The Incident&quot; take place on 183rd Street and Third Avenue and in the Third Avenue El station (once the primary El station for Arthur Avenue). The scenes, featuring Martin Sheen and Tony Musante, involve the mugging of a pedestrian. The Belmont station filled in for one on the Jerome Avenue El line, which is the line that forms the film&#x27;s narrative.

The 1950s doo-wop music group called Dion and the Belmonts originated in this area, named after Belmont Avenue. Italian rock band Elio e le Storie Tese at the end of their song &quot;Gargaroz&quot; in studio album &quot;Studentessi&quot; featured a mock advertising of a food shop in Arthur Avenue, in Italian language with some strange Americanisms.

A reality TV show called &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boys of the Bronx&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube/TLC/mbotB/HO&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was about grown men living on and around Arthur Avenue in the Bronx with their mothers.

Lady Gaga&#x27;s music video for &quot;Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)&quot; takes place in and around Arthur Avenue/Little Italy.

In 2016, Arthur Avenue was named one of &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Streets&quot; by the American Planning Association.

The 2019 movie &quot;Bottom of the 9th&quot;, which stars Joe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara, was filmed throughout the neighborhood, specifically featuring Arthur Avenue. The screenplay for the film was written by Robert Bruzio, who grew up on Arthur Avenue.

<doc id="742776" wikidata="Q142004" url="?curid=742776" title="Magog, Quebec">
<text>Magog ( , ) is a city in southeastern Quebec, Canada, about east of Montreal at the confluence of Lake Memphremagog—after which the city was named—with the Rivière aux Cerises and the Magog River. It is a major centre and industrial city in the Regional County Municipality of Memphremagog. The city lies in the Eastern Townships tourist region.

In 2002, the City of Magog was merged with the Township of Magog and the Village of Omerville as part of the municipal reorganization in Quebec.

==Etymology==
&quot;Memphremagog&quot; comes from the Abenaki word &quot; mamhlawbagak&quot;, which means &quot;large expanse of water&quot; or &quot;vast lake.&quot; &quot;Magog&quot; is believed to be a truncation of the lake&#x27;s name. However, it could also come from &quot;namagok&quot; and &quot;namagwôttik&quot;, which means &quot;the lake where there is brook trout.&quot; Others have theorised that the name has Biblical origins in Gog and Magog, or that it refers to an ancient city by the same name.

==History==
The Abenaki were the first to inhabit the region and had long visited the Memphremagog and its waterways. White settlement began in 1776, when Loyalists emigrated from nearby Vermont. They called it The Outlet, referring to the flow of water emptying into the Magog River from the lake.

Ralph Merry, who is considered the founding father of Magog, was an American Revolutionary who immigrated to Lower Canada in 1799 and settled in Bolton, to the west of the lake. He bought up all the neighbouring lots, including The Outlet village, where he went on to act as its mayor, judge, and developer. In 1821, he built a house there, which is the oldest standing house in the city.

It was formally named Magog in 1855.

At the end of the 19th century and throughout the 20th, the city&#x27;s economy was dominated by the textile industry, most notably by a cotton mill operated by Dominion Textile. It was only in the 1960s and the 1970s that the city&#x27;s economy would achieve desperately needed diversification through tourism, services, and the development of an industrial park.

In 2002, the City of Magog was merged with the Township of Magog and the Village of Omerville as part of the municipal reorganization in Quebec.

*Rouville Beaudry, Quebec nationalism activist who served in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec
*Pierre Bélanger, volleyball player who competed in the 1976 Olympics
*Nicolas Boulay, Canadian Football League player
*Reginald W. Buzzell, U.S. Army brigadier general, born in Magog
*Sonia Vachon, actress

==Geography==
Magog is a city in southeastern Quebec, Canada, about east of Montreal at the confluence of Lake Memphremagog, the Rivière aux Cerises, and the Magog River.

===Tourism===

<text>The Council for British Research in the Levant (CBRL) is a non-profit organisation that promotes humanities and social science research in the Levant. It consists of two research institutes, the Kenyon Institute in Jerusalem and the British Institute in Amman (BIA) in Amman, Jordan.

== History ==
The CBRL was established in 1998 as an amalgamation of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (now the Kenyon Institute) and the British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History (now the British Institute in Amman). While its predecessors mainly existed to support archaeological research in their respective host countries, the newly formed CBRL, sponsored by the British Academy, broadened its remit to include research into the history, culture and society of the entire Levant.

Plans to open a CBRL institute in Damascus have been suspended due to the ongoing Syrian Civil War.

== Publications ==

=== &quot;Levant&quot; ===
&quot;Levant&quot; (ISSN 1756-3801) is an academic journal of archaeological research in the Levant, first published in 1969 by the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, and later by the CBRL. It is currently produced by Maney Publishing and publishes three issues per year.

Since 2004 the CBRL has also published research monographs as the &quot;Levant Supplementary Series&quot;.

=== &quot;Contemporary Levant&quot; ===
The CBRL launched a second journal, &quot;Contemporary Levant&quot; (), in 2016, covering research on contemporary politics, society and culture in the Levant.

=== &quot;Bulletin of the Council for British Research in the Levant&quot; ===
The CBRL also produces an annual &quot;Bulletin&quot; () as its document of record, which also contains reports on research sponsored by the CBRL in the previous year aimed at a general readership. It was formerly known as the CBRL Newsletter.

<text>Film colorization (American English; or colourisation [British English], or colourization [Canadian English and Oxford English]) is any process that adds color to black-and-white, sepia, or other monochrome moving-picture images. It may be done as a special effect, to &quot;modernize&quot; black-and-white films, or to restore color segregation. The first examples date from the early 20th century, but colorization has become common with the advent of digital image processing.

==Early techniques==
===Hand colorization===
The first film colorization methods were hand-done by individuals. For example, at least 4% of George Méliès&#x27; output, including some prints of &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot; from 1902 and other major films such as &quot;The Kingdom of the Fairies&quot;, &quot;The Impossible Voyage&quot;, and &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; were individually hand-colored by Elisabeth Thuillier&#x27;s coloring lab in Paris. Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of 200 people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified; each worker was assigned a different color in assembly line style, with more than 20 separate colors often used for a single film. Thuillier&#x27;s lab produced about 60 hand-colored copies of &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, but only one copy is known to still exist today. The first full-length feature film made by a hand-colored process was &quot;The Miracle&quot;, in 1912.

The process was always done by hand, sometimes using a stencil cut from a second print of the film, such as the Pathécolor process. As late as the 1920s, hand-coloring processes were used for individual shots in &quot;Greed&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925) (both utilizing the Handschiegl color process); and rarely, an entire feature-length movie such as &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1926).

These colorization methods were employed until effective color film processes were developed. Around 1968-1972, black-and-white &quot;Betty Boop&quot;, &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons and among others were redistributed in color. Supervised by Fred Ladd, color was added by tracing the original black-and-white frames onto new animation cels, and then adding color to the new cels in South Korea. To cut time and expense, Ladd&#x27;s process skipped every other frame, cutting the frame rate in half; this technique considerably degraded the quality and timing of the original animation, to the extent that some animation was not carried over or mistakenly altered. The most recent redrawn colorized black-and-white cartoons are the Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios&#x27; &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons, the Harman-Ising &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, and MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; cartoons, which were colorized in 1987 for airing on the Turner networks. With computer technology, studios were able to add color to black-and-white films by digitally tinting single objects in each frame of the film until it was fully colorized (the first authorized computer-colorizations of B&amp;W cartoons were commissioned by Warner Bros. in 1990). The initial process was invented by Canadian Wilson Markle and was first used in 1970 to add color to monochrome footage of the moon from the Apollo program missions.

===Digital colorization===
Computerized colorization began in the 1970s using the technique invented by Wilson Markle. These early attempts at colorization have soft contrast and fairly pale, flat, washed-out color; however, the technology has improved steadily since the 1980s.

To perform digital colorization, a digitized copy of the best black and white film print available is used. With the aid of computer software, technicians associate a range of gray levels to each object and indicate to the computer any movement of the objects within a shot. The software is also capable of sensing variations in the light level from frame-to-frame and correcting it if necessary. The technician selects a color for each object based on common &quot;memory&quot; colors—such as blue sky, white clouds, flesh tones, and green grass—and on any information about colors used in the movie. If color publicity stills or props are available to examine, authentic colors may be applied. In the absence of any better information, technicians may choose colors that fit the gray level and are consistent with what a director might have wanted for the scene. The software associates a variation of the basic color with each gray level in the object, while keeping intensity levels the same as in the monochrome original. The software then follows each object from frame to frame, applying the same color until the object leaves the frame. As new objects come into the frame, the technician must associate colors to each new object in the same way as described above. This technique was patented in 1991.

In order to colorize a still image, an artist typically begins by dividing the image into regions, and then assigning a color to each region. This approach, also known as the segmentation method, is laborious and time-consuming, especially in the absence of fully automatic algorithms to identify fuzzy or complex region boundaries, such as those between a subject&#x27;s hair and face. Colorization of moving images also requires motion compensation, tracking regions as movement occurs from one frame to the next.

Several companies claim to have produced automatic region-tracking algorithms:

* Legend Films describes their core technology as pattern recognition and background compositing that moves and morphs foreground and background masks from frame to frame. In the process, backgrounds are colorized separately in a single composite frame which functions as a visual database of a cut, and includes all offset data on each camera movement. Once the foreground areas are colorized, background masks are applied frame-to-frame.
* Timebrush describes a process based on neural net technology that produces saturated and crisp colors with clear lines and no apparent spill-over. The process is cost effective because it relies on computers rather than human effort, and is equally suitable for low-budget colorization and broadcast-quality or theatrical projection.
* A team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem&#x27;s Benin School of Computer Science and Engineering describe their method as an interactive process that does not require precise manual region detection, nor accurate tracking; it is based on the premise that adjacent pixels in space and time that have similar gray levels should also have similar colors.
*At the University of Minnesota, a color propagation method was developed that uses geodesic distance.
* A highly labor-intensive process employed by the UK-based film and video colorization artist Stuart Humphryes, in conjunction with video restoration company SVS Resources, was employed by the BBC in 2013 for the commercial release of two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials: the first episode of &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot; and newly discovered black and white footage in the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot;. For these projects, approximately 7,000 key-frames (approximately every 5th PAL video frame) were fully colorized by hand, without the use of masks, layers, or the segmentation method. These were then utilized by SVS Resources to interpolate the color across the intervening surrounding frames using a part computerized/part manual process.

==Uses of colorization==
===Partial colorization===
The earliest form of colorization introduced limited color into a black-and-white film using dyes, as a visual effect. The earliest Edison films, most notably the &quot;Annabelle Serpentine Dance&quot; series, were also the earliest examples of colorization, done by painting aniline dyes onto the emulsion.

Around 1905, Pathé introduced &quot;Pathéchrome&quot;, a stencil process that required cutting one or more stencils for each film frame with the aid of a reducing pantograph.

In 1916, the Handschiegl Color Process was invented for Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s film &quot;Joan the Woman&quot; (1917). Another early example of the Handschiegl process can be found in &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925), in which Lon Chaney&#x27;s character can be seen wearing a bright-red cape while the rest of the scene remained monochrome. The scene was toned sepia, and then the cape was painted red, either by stencil or by matrix. Then, a sulfur solution was applied to everything but the dyed parts, turning the sepia into blue tone. The process was named after its inventor, Max Handschiegl. This effect, as well as a missing color sequence, were recreated in 1996 for a Photoplay Productions restoration by computer colorization (see below).

Partial colorization has also been utilized on footage shot in color to enhance commercials and broadcast television to further facilitate the director&#x27;s artistic vision. As an example, Cerulean Fx provided partial colorization for Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s music video &quot;The Space Between&quot; as well as Outkast&#x27;s music videos &quot;Bombs Over Baghdad&quot; and &quot;Roses&quot;.

===Restoration===
A number of British television shows which were made in color in the early 1970s were wiped for economic reasons, but in some cases black-and-white telerecordings were made for export to countries that did not yet have color television. An example is the BBC&#x27;s five-part &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Dæmons&quot;. Only one episode survived in color; the rest existed only as black-and-white film recordings. The only known color recording was a poor-quality over-the-air recording of an abridged broadcast in the United States. In the 1990s, the BBC colorized the black-and-white copies by adding the color signal from the over-the-air recordings. The result was judged a success by both technicians and fans. In March 2008, it was announced that new technology, which involves detecting color artifacts (&quot;dot crawl&quot;) in high-resolution scans of black-and-white films, will be used to restore other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes as well as shows like &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; where some episodes originally produced in color only exist in black-and-white. However, there are no plans to use colorization on BBC programmes originally &quot;produced&quot; in black-and-white, such as the 1960s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes, since they have no color information available and so cannot be recovered using these methods.

===Integration===
Colorization is also sometimes used on historical stock footage in color movies. For instance, the film &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; (2000) uses colorized news footage from the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.

The full-color feature film &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot; (2004), which already made heavy use of digitally generated sets and objects, integrated black-and-white 1940s footage of Sir Laurence Olivier into scenes by colorizing him.

In his feature film &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2005), Martin Scorsese seamlessly blended colorized stock footage of the &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; movie premiere with footage of the premiere&#x27;s reenactment. The colorization by Legend Films was designed to look like normal three-strip film but was then color corrected to match the two-strip look of the premiere&#x27;s reenactment. Also in &quot;The Aviator&quot;, Scorsese used colorized footage of Jane Russell from the original black-and-white film, &quot;The Outlaw&quot; and dog fight scenes from &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

==Colorization examples, criticism, and controversies==
===Entertainment make-overs===
In 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the business of computerized film colorization. Buying a 50 percent interest in Wilson Markle&#x27;s Colorization, Inc., it began creating digitally colored versions of some of its films. Roach&#x27;s &quot;Topper&quot; (1937), followed by &quot;Way Out West&quot; (1937), became the first black-and-white films to be redistributed in color using the digital colorization process, leading to controversy. Defenders of the process noted that it would allow black-and-white films to have new audiences of people who were not used to the format. Detractors complained (among other reasons) that the process was crude and claimed that, even if it were refined, it would not take into account lighting compositions chosen for black-and-white photography which would not necessarily be as effective in color. Figures opposed to the process included Roger Ebert, James Stewart, John Huston, George Lucas, and Woody Allen.

Cary Grant was reportedly &quot;very gung-ho with the outcome&quot; of the colorization of &quot;Topper&quot;. Director Frank Capra met with Wilson Markle about colorizing the perennial Christmas classic &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; and &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; based on Grant&#x27;s enthusiasm. Colorization, Inc.&#x27;s art director Brian Holmes screened ten minutes of colorized footage from &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; to Capra, which led Capra to sign a contract with Colorization, Inc. However, the film was believed to be in the public domain at the time, and, as a result, Markle and Holmes responded by returning Capra&#x27;s initial investment, eliminating his financial participation, and refusing outright to allow the director to exercise artistic control over the colorization of his films, leading Capra to join in the campaign against the process.

On a December 27, 1989 episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; actor Jimmy Stewart criticized efforts to colorize old black-and-white films, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.
In 1986, film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert did a special episode of &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; addressing colorization as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s New Vandalism&quot;. Siskel explained how networks were unable to show classic black-and-white films in prime-time unless they offer it in color. &quot;They arrest people who spray subway cars, they lock up people who attack paintings and sculptures in museums, and adding color to black and white films, even if it&#x27;s only to the tape shown on TV or sold in stores, is vandalism nonetheless.&quot; Roger Ebert added, &quot;What was so wrong about black and white movies in the first place? By filming in black and white, movies can sometimes be more dreamlike and elegant and stylized and mysterious. They can add a whole additional dimension to reality, while color sometimes just supplies additional unnecessary information.&quot;

Media mogul Ted Turner was once an aggressive proponent of this process, by employing the San Diego firm American Film Technologies. When he told members of the press in July 1988 that he was considering colorizing &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, Turner&#x27;s comments led to an immediate public outcry. In January 1989 the Associated Press reported that two companies were producing color tests of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased with the AP&#x27;s report that filmmaker Henry Jaglom remembered that, shortly before his death, Orson Welles had implored him to protect &quot;Kane&quot; from being colorized.

On February 14, 1989, Turner Entertainment president Roger Mayer announced that work to colorize &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; had been stopped:
Our attorneys looked at the contract between RKO Pictures Inc. and Orson Welles and his production company, Mercury Productions Inc., and, on the basis of their review, we have decided not to proceed with colorization of the movie. ... While a court test might uphold our legal right to colorize the film, provisions of the contract could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate.

One minute of the colorized test footage of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was included in a special &quot;Arena&quot; documentary, &quot;The Complete Citizen Kane&quot;, produced by the BBC in 1991.

John Huston&#x27;s opposition to the colorization of his work led to a landmark three-year French legal case after his death, sparked by a colorized version of &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;. His daughter Anjelica Huston successfully used French copyright law to set a binding precedent in 1991 that prevents the distribution or broadcasting in France of any colorized version of a film against the wishes of the original creator or their heirs. Major legislative reaction in the United States was the National Film Preservation Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-446), which prohibits any person from knowingly distributing or exhibiting to the public a film that has been materially altered, or a black and white film that has been colorized and is included in the Registry, unless such films are labeled disclosing specified information. This law also created the National Film Registry.

Because of the high cost of the process, Turner Entertainment stopped colorizing titles. With the coming of DVD technology, the notion of colorization was once again gaining press. Because the DVD format was more versatile, studios could offer viewers the option to choose between both versions without switching discs, and thus, the release of colorized titles once again seemed profitable. Some companies rereleased the older colorized versions from the 1980s—an example of this is the Laurel and Hardy box set being released in the UK.

Other studios, such as Sony Entertainment, commissioned West Wing Studios to colorize several Three Stooges films for DVD release. The studio was given access to the original Columbia Studios props and sets to lend authenticity to the colorized versions.

Both film and television restoration and colorization is produced by the company Legend Films. Their patented automated process was used to colorize around 100 films between 2003 and 2009. Shirley Temple, Jane Russell, Terry Moore, and Ray Harryhausen have worked with the company to colorize either their own films or their personal favorites. Two movies that Legend Films are noted for is the colorization of the exploitation film &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;, for which certain color schemes were used to create a psychedelic effect in its viewers, and &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;. Recently (2007), Legend Films colorized &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; for Paramount Pictures (whose subsidiary, Republic Pictures, had regained control of the copyright in the 1990s) and &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; in 2008 for rights holder Universal Pictures.

In 2004, a classic Indian film, &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot;, was colored for theatrical release all over the world by the Indian Academy of Arts and Animation (IAAA) in association with Sankranti Creations. Since 2013, Livepixel Technologies, founded by Rajeev Dwivedi has been the sole player in film colorization business and almost completed more than 100 titles related with World War.

In 2005, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;Bewitched&quot; on DVD. Because the first season was produced in black-and-white, Sony released two versions of the set: one with the episodes as originally broadcast and a second with the episodes colorized. A year later, the second season of &quot;Bewitched&quot; and the first season of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, another show owned by Sony, were released the same way. These releases were colorized by Dynacs Digital Studios, a Florida-based company with film colorization and animation studios in Patna, India.

CBS has colorized a number of episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; in the 2010s, which are timed to air on Friday nights in holiday periods.

Colorization has also been used to restore scenes from color films that were cut from the finished product but were preserved in black-and-white. In 2018, the originally intended closing scene to the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot; (in which the lead characters kiss) was added to the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary release. A challenge that still plagues colorization efforts is the fact that the colorized black-and-white film may not match film shot originally in color; Randal Kleiser, the director of &quot;Grease&quot;, wanted to edit the scene back into the film but found the colors between the scenes did not match well enough to do so. Kleiser is optimistic that colorization technology will be advanced enough to match true color by 2028, when &quot;Grease&quot; reaches its 50th anniversary.

===Documentary make-overs===
Colorization is sometimes used on documentary programmes. &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; TV show colorizes some footage of the band, such as the performance of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; from the TV special &quot;Our World&quot; (1967). In the documentary, this scene begins in its original black-and-white before dissolving into seemingly realistic, psychedelic color. The color design was based on color photographs taken at the same time as the special was shot. More Beatle footage was colorized for the 2016 documentary &quot;The Beatles: Eight Days a Week&quot;, such as a performance of &quot;Help!&quot;&quot;

The documentary series &quot;World War 1 in Colour&quot; (2003) was broadcast on television and released on DVD in 2005. There had previously been full-color documentaries about World War II using genuine color footage, but since true color film was not practical for moving pictures at the time of World War I, the series consists of colorized contemporary footage (and photographs). Several documentaries on the Military Channel feature colorized war footage from the Second World War and the Korean War.

The 1960 Masters Tournament, originally broadcast in black-and-white and recorded on kinescope, was colorized by Legend Films for the documentary &quot;Jim Nantz Remembers&quot;. This was the first time a major sports event had been rebroadcast using colorization.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s well-received 2018 documentary, &quot;They Shall Not Grow Old&quot;, black and white footage from First World War trenches was colorized.

The Greatest Game Ever Played, the 1958 NFL Championship between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants, was colorized by Legend Films for ESPN for a sports broadcast special in December 2008.

<text>Zhang Ling (; traditionally 22 February 34–10 October 156), courtesy name Fuhan (), was a Chinese religious leader who lived during the Eastern Han dynasty credited with founding the Way of the Celestial Masters sect of Taoism, which is also known as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice, and he is credited as being the founder of Taoism in legend. He is also the grandfather of the warlord Zhang Lu.

He is also known as Zhang Daoling (), Celestial Master Zhang (, &quot;Zhāng tiānshī&quot;), Ancestral Celestial Master (, &quot;Zǔtiānshī&quot;) or Zhengyi Zhenren () to Taoists. Zhang is sometimes pictured riding on a tiger. In some Taoist sects, Zhang, along with Ge Xuan, Xu Xun () and Sa Shoujian (), are called the &quot;Four Celestial Masters&quot; ().

==Biography==
The details of the life of the historical figure Zhang Ling are obscure; most of the information about him comes from later scripture and hagiography. According to these, Zhang traced his ancestral home to Feng County, Jiangsu, and was said to be a descendant of Zhang Liang. He was born in the tenth year of the &quot;Jianwu&quot; era during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han. He started reading the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; at a young age and studied in the Taixue (Imperial Academy) before. He served as a magistrate in Jiangzhou, Ba Commandery (present-day Chongqing) during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han.

Zhang later retired and led a reclusive life at Mount Beimang, where he practiced taoist methods of achieving longevity. When invited to serve as a &quot;boshi&quot; (equivalent of a present-day professor) in the Imperial Academy, he claimed that he was ill. Emperor He of Han summoned him thrice to serve as the &quot;Taifu&quot; (Imperial Tutor) but he refused again.

According to hagiographies compiled in approximately 400 C.E., in 142 C.E. the deity Taishang Laojun (a deified Laozi) revealed to Zhang on Mount Heming the &quot;Doctrine of the Orthodox One [Resting On] the Authority of the Alliance&quot; (), and bestowed upon him the title Celestial Master. The deity warned that plagues, beasts, and the demons of the Three Offices and Six Heavens of the underworld were due to be released upon humankind, and that only 240,000 people would be chosen as survivors and &quot;seed people&quot; () to populate the new age, the era of Great Peace.

Zhang then endeavored to reform supposedly degenerate religious practices. After gathering numerous followers, he started a health cult that advocated certain longevity practices, recorded in books which have been lost. He founded a theocratic state in Sichuan organized into 24 parishes, later 28, which outsiders called the Way of Five Pecks of Rice, after a tax of that amount levied on followers.

A major change instituted by the new Covenant was the rejection of food and animal sacrifices. According to Zhang, the updated teachings of Laozi included the first true Taoist religious pantheon as distinguished from the prior ancient religion of China. The &quot;Xiang&#x27;er&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; preserved today in a sixth-century manuscript, is traditionally ascribed to Zhang Daoling&#x27;s authorship and even if not his work may reflect his teachings.

Zhang is said to have died on Mount Qingcheng in 156 during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han at the purported age of 123. However, it is also said that Zhang did not die but ascended in broad daylight (&quot;Xiandao&quot;). Zhang reportedly disappeared on the day of his death, leaving nothing behind but his clothes.

==Descendants==

His descendants have held the title of Celestial Masters up to the present day, with the most recent claimants of the title currently residing in Mainland China and Taiwan. They also held the title of .

<doc id="742802" wikidata="Q460890" url="?curid=742802" title="Keiko Fukuda">
<text>was a Japanese-American martial artist. She was the highest-ranked female judoka in history, holding the rank of 9th &quot;dan&quot; from the Kodokan (2006), and 10th &quot;dan&quot; from USA Judo (July 2011) and from the United States Judo Federation (USJF) (September 2011), and was the last surviving student of Kanō Jigorō, founder of judo. She was a renowned pioneer of women&#x27;s judo, and in 1972 together with her senpai Masako Noritomi (1913–1982) was one of the first two women promoted to 6th &quot;dan&quot; (c. 1972). In 2006, the Kodokan promoted Fukuda to 9th &quot;dan&quot;, making her the first woman to hold this rank from any recognized judo organization. She is also the first and, so far, only woman to have been promoted to 10th &quot;dan&quot; in judo, which occurred in 2011. After completing her formal education in Japan, Fukuda visited the United States to teach in the 1950s and 1960s, and eventually settled there. She continued to teach her art in the San Francisco Bay Area until her death in 2013.

==Early life==
Fukuda was born on April 12, 1913, in Tokyo. Her father died when she was very young. As a youth, she learned the arts of calligraphy, flower arrangement, and the tea ceremony; typical pursuits for a woman in Japan at that time. Despite her conventional upbringing, Fukuda felt close to judo through memories of her grandfather, and one day went with her mother to watch a judo training session. A few months later, she decided to begin training for herself. Her mother and brother supported this decision, but her uncle was opposed to the idea. Her mother and brother had thought that Fukuda would eventually marry one of the judo practitioners, but she never married, instead becoming a judo expert herself.

Fukuda&#x27;s grandfather, Fukuda Hachinosuke, had been a samurai and master of Tenjin Shinyō-ryū jujutsu, and he had taught that art to Kanō Jigorō, founder of judo and head of the Kodokan. Kanō had studied under three jujutsu masters before founding judo, and Fukuda&#x27;s grandfather had been the first of these men. Kanō had taught female students as early as 1893 (Sueko Ashiya) and had formally opened the &quot;joshi-bu&quot; (women&#x27;s section) of the Kodokan in 1926. He personally invited the young Fukuda to study judo—an unusual gesture for that time—as a mark of respect for her grandfather. She began training in judo in 1935, as one of only 24 women training at the Kodokan. Apart from instruction by judo&#x27;s founder, Fukuda also learned from Kyuzo Mifune.

==Judo career==
Fukuda, standing at only 4&#x27; 11&quot; (150 cm) and weighing less than 100 lb. (45 kg), became a judo instructor in 1937. She also earned a degree in Japanese literature from Showa Women&#x27;s University. In 1953, she was promoted to the rank of 5th &quot;dan&quot; in judo. She traveled to the United States of America later that year, at the invitation of a judo club in Oakland, California, and stayed for almost two years before returning to Japan. Fukuda next traveled to the US in 1966, giving seminars in California. At that time, she was one of only four women in the world ranked at 5th &quot;dan&quot; in judo, and was one of only two female instructors at the Kodokan (the other being Masako Noritomi, also ranked 5th &quot;dan&quot;). In 1966, she demonstrated her art at Mills College, and the institution immediately offered her a teaching position; she accepted, and taught there from 1967 to 1978.

During this time, Fukuda lived at the Noe Valley home of one of her students, Shelley Fernandez, and taught judo there in addition to her teaching at the college. When the class sizes grew, she shifted the classes to the Sokoji Zen Buddhist temple in the Japantown, San Francisco. She named her school the Soko Joshi Judo Club. Having settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, Fukuda gave up her Japanese citizenship to become a US citizen.

In November 1972, following a letter campaign against the rule prohibiting women from being promoted to higher than 5th &quot;dan&quot;, Fukuda and her senpai Masako Noritomi (1913–1982) became the first women promoted to 6th &quot;dan&quot; by the Kodokan. According to Fukuda, &quot;the Kodokan was old fashioned and sexist about belts and ranks&quot;. In 1973, she published &quot;Born for the Mat: A Kodokan kata textbook for women&quot;, an instructional book for women about the &quot;kata&quot; (patterns) of Kodokan judo. In 1974, she established the annual Joshi Judo Camp to give female judo practitioners the opportunity to train together. That year, she was one of only three women in the world ranked 6th &quot;dan&quot; in judo.

In 1990, Fukuda was awarded Japan&#x27;s Order of the Sacred Treasure, 4th Class (Gold Rays with Rosette), and the United States Judo Incorporated (USJI) Henry Stone Lifetime Contribution to American Judo Award. In 2004, she published &quot;Ju-No-Kata: A Kodokan textbook, revised and expanded from Born for the Mat&quot;, a pictorial guide for performing Ju-no-kata, one of the seven Kodokan &quot;kata&quot;. Fukuda served as a technical adviser for US Women&#x27;s Judo and the USJI Kata Judges&#x27; Certification Sub-committee. She also served as a National Kata Judge, and was a faculty member of the USJI National Teachers&#x27; Institute, a member of the USJF Promotion Committee, and a member of the USJF and USJI Women&#x27;s Sub-committee.

Fukuda held the rank of 9th &quot;dan&quot;, the second-highest in judo, from two organizations, and in July 2011, received the rank of 10th &quot;dan&quot; from a third organization. In 1994, she was the first woman to be awarded a rare red belt (at the time for women still marking the 8th &quot;dan&quot; rank) in judo by the Kodokan. In 2001, the USJF promoted her to USJF 9th dan (red belt) for her lifelong contribution to the art of judo. In 2006 the Kodokan awarded Fukuda the 9th degree black belt (9th dan), making her the first woman to hold this rank from any recognized judo organization. On July 28, 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded Fukuda the rank of 10th &quot;dan&quot;, an action which was followed by the USJF&#x27;s promotion board on September 10, 2011.

==Later life==
Fukuda continued to teach judo three times each week, host the annual Fukuda Invitational Kata Championships, and teach at the annual Joshi Judo Camp until her death, at the age of 99, in San Francisco, California. She established the Keiko Fukuda Judo Scholarship to encourage and enable women to continue their formal training in the art. Apart from teaching in the USA, she also taught in Australia, Canada, France, Norway and the Philippines. Fukuda&#x27;s personal motto was: &quot;Tsuyoku, Yasashiku, Utsukushiku&quot; (in English: &quot;Be strong, be gentle, be beautiful, in mind, body, and spirit&quot;).

==Death==
Fukuda died peacefully at her home in San Francisco on February 9, 2013.

<doc id="742825" wikidata="Q7892209" url="?curid=742825" title="United States Space Command">
<text>United States Space Command (USSPACECOM or SPACECOM) is a unified combatant command of the United States Department of Defense, responsible for military operations in outer space, specifically all operations 100 kilometers (62 miles) and greater above mean sea level. U.S. Space Command is responsible for the operational employment of space forces that are provided by the uniformed services of the Department of Defense.

Space Command was originally created in September 1985 to provide joint command and control for all military forces in outer space and coordinate with the other combatant commands. SPACECOM was disestablished in 2002, and its responsibilities and forces were merged into United States Strategic Command. It was reestablished on 29 August 2019, with a reemphasized focus on space as a warfighting domain.

The U.S. Space Force is the military service responsible for organizing, training, and equipping the majority of forces for U.S. Space Command, which also includes a smaller number of forces from each of the other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.

==Mission==
U.S. Space Command, working with allies and partners, plans, executes, and integrates military spacepower into multi-domain global operations in order to deter aggression, defend national interests, and when necessary, defeat threats.

U.S. Space Command has four &quot;space truths&quot; that provide the foundation for its vision and operations:
*Space is a vital interest that is integral to the American way of life and national security.
*Space superiority enables the Joint Force to rapidly transition from competition to conflict and prevail in a global, all-domain fight.
*Space warfighters generate the combat power to win in space.
*Space provides the warfighter a combat advantage from the ultimate high ground to the last tactical mile.

==History==
===Early military space defense===

Early military space activities were predominantly focused on research and development, rather than operations, and split across the Air Force, Army, and Navy. In 1959, Admiral Arleigh Burke proposed the creation of the Defense Astronautical Agency to control all military space programs. This proposal was supported by the Army and Navy, but opposed by the Air Force.

Arguing that space defense was an extension of air defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff ultimately agreed with the Air Force, putting operational control of space defense forces under the unified Continental Air Defense Command and multinational North American Air Defense Command in 1960. In 1975, Continental Air Defense Command was inactivated and replaced with Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM), a specified command led by the Air Force. In 1981, North American Air Defense Command changed its name to North American Aerospace Defense Command to better reflect its role in both air and space defense.

===Strategic Defense Initiative and the first U.S. Space Command===


The Reagan Administration&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative brought a new focus on space. In 1983, General James V. Hartinger, the commander of Aerospace Defense Command and Air Force Space Command, proposed movement towards a unified space command. The Air Force supported a unified command, which would be dominated by the aerospace service, however, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps were satisfied with the current arrangement. However, the White House supported the Air Force&#x27;s position that a unified command should be created, and on 20 November 1984, President Ronald Reagan approved its establishment. U.S. Space Command&#x27;s missions would include integrating tactical warning and space operations, including control of space, direction of space support activities, and planning for ballistic missile defense. U.S. Space Command would also replace Aerospace Defense Command as the supporting U.S. command to North American Aerospace Defense Command, sharing the same commander.

On 23 September 1985, U.S. Space Command was activated as a functional combatant command at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Springs and Aerospace Defense Command was inactivated on 19 December 1986. In February 1988, U.S. Space Command was assigned the ballistic missile defense mission in preparation for assuming operational command of the Strategic Defense Initiative. However, the end of the Cold War significantly reduced the investment in SDI.

In 1991, the Joint Chiefs of Staff debated establishing U.S. Strategic Command assume responsibility for nuclear deterrence, missile defense, and space. U.S. Space Command would have been made a sub-unified command under the U.S. Strategic Command. However, the decisive role played by U.S. Space Command in the Persian Gulf War prevented its absorption into U.S. Strategic Command, providing tactical missile warning, GPS, and other space data to forces in theater.

In 1997, General Howell M. Estes III proposed designating space as a geographic area of responsibility, transitioning U.S. Space Command from a functional to a geographic command. This effort was opposed by the Joint Staff, the State Department, and the National Security Council and did not occur. However, there was growing discussion about giving U.S. Space Command the mission for information support and renaming it to United States Space and Information Command. While U.S. Space Command was not renamed, it did assume responsibility for information, or cyberspace, operations. 

Following the September 11 attacks, there was a growing focus on homeland defense and counter-terrorism at the expense of space. The Defense Department was intent on establishing United States Northern Command, merging U.S. Space Command and U.S. Strategic Command in 2002. On 1 October 2002, the first U.S. Space Command was shut down.

===Space in U.S. Strategic Command===
On 1 October 2002, as U.S. Space Command inactivated, a new U.S. Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, stood up. Within STRATCOM, the responsibilities for space operations were initially managed by the Joint Functional Component Command for Space and Global Strike, led by the commander of the Air Force&#x27;s Eighth Air Force. However, in 2006, space regained its own functional component under U.S. Strategic Command, under the command of the Fourteenth Air Force commanded.

Following the inactivation of U.S. Space Command in 2002, Russia and China began developing sophisticated on-orbit capabilities and an array of counter-space weapons. In particular, China conducted the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test, destroying its Fengyun spacecraft, which, according to NASA, created 2,841 high-velocity debris items, a larger amount of dangerous space junk than any other space event in history. In 2008, U.S. Strategic Command conducted Operation Burnt Frost to destroy a non-functioning National Reconnaissance Office satellite, before its toxic hydrazine tank could reenter and cause potential harm to human safety, with a RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 launched from the .

This construct lasted until 2017, when the commander of Air Force Space Command became the Joint Force Space Component Commander, replacing it.

===U.S. Space Command reestablished===
The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which was signed into law in 2018, directed the re-establishment of U.S. Space Command as a sub-unified combatant command under U.S. Strategic Command; however, in December 2018, the Trump administration directed that U.S. Space Command instead be a newly established, full unified combatant command, with full responsibilities for space.

On March 26, 2019, U.S. Air Force General John Raymond was nominated to be the commander of the second establishment of USSPACECOM, pending Senate approval. In 2019 the Department of the Air Force released the list of finalists for the location of Headquarters Space Command: Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, Schriever Air Force Base, Peterson Air Force Base, Buckley Air Force Base, Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Redstone Arsenal. U.S. Space Command was officially reestablished as a geographic combatant command on August 29, 2019, during a ceremony at the White House. The former Joint Force Space Component Commander was dissolved and folded into Space Command. Following the creation of the United States Space Force in December 2019, the Department of the Air Force widened its search for a location of Space Command&#x27;s permanent headquarters.
USSPACECOM has two subordinate commands: Combined Force Space Component Command (CFSCC), and Joint Task Force Space Defense (JTF-SD). CFSCC plans, integrates, conducts, and assesses global space operations in order to deliver combat relevant space capabilities to Combatant Commanders, Coalition partners, the Joint Force, and the Nation. JTF-SD conducts, in unified action with mission partners, space superiority operations to deter aggression, defend U.S. and allied interests, and defeat adversaries throughout the continuum of conflict.

In August 2020, In the meeting of the National Space Council, acting Director of National Intelligence announced &quot;in case of an attack on the U.S. satellites the operational control of intelligence community assets will be in the ambit of the military&quot;, resulting in the National Reconnaissance Office being operationally subordinated to the commander of U.S. Space Command in matters of space defense.


On 24 August 2021, two years after its establishment, U.S. Space Command announced that it had reached initial operating capability. Achieving full operating capability, according to Lieutenant General John E. Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command, is dependent on the selection of the combatant command&#x27;s permanent headquarters.

U.S. Space Command is planning to reorganize its subordinate commands, possibly reactivating the Joint Force Space Component Command (JFSCC), the precursor organization of the combatant command. JFSSC is planned to be the combatant command&#x27;s &quot;primary warfighting command,&quot; formed by combining CFSCC and JTF–SD. Space Force Lieutenant General Stephen Whiting, commander of SpOC, is planned to lead the new organization.

In 2023, U.S. Space Command regained its responsibility for missile defense from U.S. Strategic Command and will be taking over the Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated Missile Defense.

====Headquarters====
In January 2021, it was announced that Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama was the preferred final location for U.S. Space Command. The other locations in contention were Kirtland Air Force Base, Offutt Air Force Base, Joint Base San Antonio, its interim location at Peterson Space Force Base, and Patrick Space Force Base. Despite Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado, being both the original and interim location of Space Command headquarters, Redstone Arsenal was selected, reportedly due to political pressure directly from then-president Donald Trump. A formal review from the DoD IG was initiated to ensure the process that selected Huntsville as the preferred location was impartial and factually sound. Former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin came out with his public support and backed the Department of the Air Force&#x27;s decision process which resulted in the selection of Redstone Arsenal. In May 2022, the review found that the selection of Redstone Arsenal as the permanent site was reasonable and justified. In July 2023, the move to Huntsville was cancelled. Gen. James Dickinson, Commander of the Space Command, argued that moving the headquarters to Alabama from its current location in Colorado Springs would hurt military readiness. Republicans have accused the Biden administration of acting out of spite due to a partisan standoff over the Pentagon&#x27;s abortion access policies at the time.

==Organization==


Previous, now-deactivated functional components included the Combined Force Space Component Command at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, and the Joint Task Force–Space Defense at Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado. Both were disestablished with the creation of U.S. Space Forces – Space to take on SpOC&#x27;s Space Force responsibilities.

===Relationship with the United States Space Force===
United States Space Command is the unified combatant command for all military space operations, while the United States Space Force is the military service responsible for organizing, training, and equipping the majority of forces for U.S. Space Command. Space Command&#x27;s Space Force service component is Space Operations Command, providing the majority of space forces. U.S. Space Command also consists of smaller amounts of forces from the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, and United States Air Force. This mirrors the relationship between the Space Force&#x27;s predecessor, Air Force Space Command, and U.S. Space Command (and between 2002 and 2019, United States Strategic Command).

==Emblem and symbols==

===U.S. Space Command seal (2019)===
Shield: The bald eagle, a traditional symbol of American strength and vigilance, carries an olive branch in his right talon, symbolizing the worldwide goal of peaceful operations in space. In his left talon is a cluster of thirteen arrows with the silver delta as arrowheads, indicative of the strength and power necessary to protect our citizens and allies. The delta symbol is historically associated with space and represents change and innovation, and the cluster of deltoids thrusting upward into space signifies our ever growing aspirations in space beyond earth’s orbit. The blue globe with silver land masses, as viewed from space, signifies the origin and control point for all space assets and represents the global operations of the command in mission areas such as surveillance, navigation, communications and missile warning. The silver and white Polaris signifies our constant presence and vigilance in space now and in the future. Encompassing the globe are two white elliptical orbits representing the unity of U.S. Space Command with our joint and combined partners, and which intersect over the United States, the terrestrial heart of the command. An arc of four silver stars above the eagle symbolizes the four-star combatant commander of U.S. Space Command. The black background represents the infinity of space.

Seal: The coat of arms as blazoned in full color on a black disk, bearing the night sky, enclosed by a silver border, and inscribed &quot;UNITED STATES&quot; above and &quot;SPACE COMMAND&quot; below, all silver.

===Army element shoulder sleeve and distinctive unit insignia===

====Shoulder sleeve insignia====
Black and gold together symbolize the United States Army. Black signifies the vast infinity of space and gold denotes high standards for excellence. The demi-globe represents the earth as seen from space and symbolizes the global operations of the command. The crossed orbital rings denote the unity of United States Space Command (USSPACECOM) with joint and combined partners. The rings intersect over the United States, identifying the terrestrial heart of the command. The gold pheon represents the combat power of Army Space. Four stars represent the four-star combatant commander of USSPACECOM. The Polaris star signifies constant presence and vigilance in space now and into the future.
