<text>Sarajevo is a city now in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Ancient history==
The earliest known settlements in Sarajevo were those of the Neolithic Butmir culture. The discoveries at Butmir were made in modern-day Ilidža, Sarajevo&#x27;s chief suburb. The area&#x27;s richness in flint, as well as the Željeznica river helped the settlement flourish. The Butmir culture is most famous for its ceramics. 

The Butmir culture was conquered by the Illyrians around 2400 BC. The most prominent of their settlements near Sarajevo was &quot;Debelo Brdo&quot; (literally &quot;Fat Hill&quot;), where an Illyrian fortification stood during the late Iron Age. Numerous Illyrian forts also existed in other parts of the city, as well as at the base of Trebević. The Illyrians in the Sarajevo region were the Daesitiates, who were the last to resist Roman occupation. Their last revolt occurred in 9 AD, and was stopped by the emperor Tiberius, marking the start of Roman rule in the region.

Under Roman rule, Sarajevo was part of the province of Dalmatia. A major Roman road ran through the Miljacka river valley, connecting the cities of the Adriatic coast with Pannonia in the north. The largest known settlement in the region was known as &quot;Aquae S...&quot; (probably Aquae Sulphurae), at present-day Ilidža.

==Middle Ages==
The Slavs came to Bosnia in the 7th century. It is fairly certain that they settled in the Sarajevo valley, replacing the Illyrians. Katera, one of the two Bosnian towns mentioned as a part of Serbia by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, was southeast of Sarajevo. By the time of the Ottoman occupation in the 15th century, there was little settlement in the region.

The first mentions of Bosnia describe a small region, basically the Bosna river valley, stretching from modern-day Zenica to Sarajevo. In the 12th century, when Bosnia became a vassal of Hungary, the population consisted primarily of members of the Bosnian Church. The area of present-day Sarajevo was part of the Bosnian province of Vrhbosna. Another theory is that Vrhbosna was a major settlement located in the middle of modern-day Sarajevo. Perhaps a village existed on the outskirts of the city itself, near present-day Ilidža, one of the most attractive regions in the area, which had been significantly populated for about every other period of its history. It is possible that Vrhbosna may have been destroyed sometime between the 13th century and the Ottoman occupation. Foreign armies had often made their way to Vrhbosna in wars with Bosnia, and perhaps one of them razed the city, leaving it in the condition that the Turks found it in the mid-15th century. Papal documents indicate that in 1238, a cathedral dedicated to Saint Paul was built in the city. It is speculated that the cathedral was located in the present-day Sarajevo neighborhood of Skenderija, as during construction in that neighborhood in the late 19th century, Roman-style columns were found dating to some time around the 12th century. Disciples of the saints Cyril and Methodius traveled to the region, founding a church near Vrelo Bosne. Vrhbosna was a Slavic citadel from 1263 until it was occupied by the Ottoman Empire in 1429.

Various documents from the High Middle Ages reference a place called &#x27;Tornik&#x27; in the region. By all indications, &#x27;Tornik&#x27; was a very small marketplace and village, and was not considered important by Ragusan merchants. The local fortress of Hodidjed was defended by a mere two dozen men when it fell to the Turks. Sarajevo also fell under siege.

== Early Ottoman era ==
Sarajevo was founded when the Ottoman Empire conquered the region, with 1461 typically regarded as the date of the city&#x27;s founding. The first known Ottoman governor of Bosnia, Isa-Beg Ishaković, chose the village of Brodac as a good space for a new city. He exchanged land with its residents, giving them what is now the Hrasnica neighborhood in Ilidža. He built a number of buildings, including a mosque, a closed marketplace, a public bath, a bridge, a hostel, and the saray which gave the city its present name. The mosque was named &quot;Careva džamija&quot; (the Emperor&#x27;s Mosque, or the Imperial Mosque) in honor of Mehmed II. Sarajevo quickly grew into the largest city in the region. Many Christians converted to Islam at this time, and there was a growing Orthodox population. A colony of Ragusan merchants also appeared in Sarajevo at this time. In the early 16th century, Jewish refugees from Andalusia brought the Sarajevo Haggadah.

Under the leadership of Gazi Husrev-beg, a major donor who was responsible for most of what is now the Old Town, Sarajevo grew at a rapid rate. Sarajevo became known for its large marketplace and its mosques, of which there were more than one hundred by the middle of the 16th century. Gazi Husrev-Beg established a number of buildings named in his honor, such as the Sarajevo library. He also built the city&#x27;s clock tower, the Sahat Kula.

At its height, Sarajevo was the largest and most important Ottoman city in the Balkans after Istanbul. By 1660, the population of Sarajevo was estimated to be over 80,000.

==Late Ottoman era==
Following the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the western portion of the Ottoman Empire was subject to raids. Prince Eugene of Savoy raided Sarajevo and torched it. Very few structures survived the fire besides those built of stone. By then, the seat of Bosnian government had moved to Travnik. For ten years between 1747 and 1757, Sarajevo experienced anarchy.

Mehmed Mejlija Guranij and Mula Mustafa Bašeskija were from Sarajevo during the 18th century. Significant libraries, schools, mosques, and fortifications were built at the time.

In 1783, there was an outbreak of plague, and five years later, there was another fire. By the early 19th century, Serbia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, creating a wedge between Sarajevo and Istanbul.

Demanding Bosnian independence from the Turks, Husein-Kapetan Gradaščević fought several battles around Bosnia. The last was the Battle of Sarajevo Field in 1832, where he was betrayed by a fellow Bosniak and lost. There, he spoke his famous words, &quot;This is the last day of our freedom.&quot; For the next several decades, no major developments occurred.

==Austria-Hungary==
===Background===
The Berlin Treaty was imposed by the Great Powers upon the rapidly dissolving Ottoman Empire, which entered the negotiations from a position of weakness, with many of its former territories having achieved &quot;de facto&quot; independence over the previous half-century and having just been defeated in the Russo-Turkish War. Although the Bosnia Vilayet was part of the Ottoman Empire &quot;de jure&quot;, it was &quot;de facto&quot; governed as an integral part of Austria-Hungary with the Ottomans having no say in its governance.

====Eastern Crisis 1875–1878====
Previously, the Ottoman position in the Bosnia Vilayet was weakened by the 1875–1877 Herzegovina uprising, an armed revolt by the local ethnic Serb population that began in the Herzegovina region in July 1875 before spreading to the rest of the vilayet. The uprising lasted more than two years before the Ottomans, aided by the local Muslim population, managed to stop it. In 1875, inspired by the Herzegovina uprising, the exiled Bulgarian revolutionaries operating out of the neighbouring United Romanian Principalities (another &quot;de jure&quot; Ottoman vassal which was steadily moving towards independence) began planning for their own uprising which began in the spring of 1876. The Ottoman reaction to the Bulgarian insurrection was swift and brutal, leading to many atrocities and universal international condemnation as the uprising was put down within months.

Austria-Hungary closely followed the events of the 1875 Serb peasant rebellion in Bosnia. Shaped by the Austrian-Hungarian foreign minister, Count Gyula Andrássy, who was appointed in 1871 to replace Friedrich von Beust, the dual monarchy&#x27;s foreign policy identified the Near East as the area of particular interest for its next expansion. Andrássy saw an opportunity to move this policy forward, and on 30 December 1875 he sent a dispatch to his foreign ministry predecessor, Von Beust, who was the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Service&#x27;s ambassador to the United Kingdom. In the document, known as the &quot;Andrássy Note,&quot; Andrássy outlined his vision for Bosnia as a territory governed and administered by Austria-Hungary. After obtaining general assent from the UK and France, the document became official basis for negotiations.

Simultaneous with their defeats in the Russo-Turkish War, Ottoman rule in the Bosnia Vilayet was weakening. Logistical and organisational issues began arising in the Ottoman army, such as inability to feed and clothe its soldiers, including the nineteen garrisons stationed in the Bosnia Vilayet, seventeen of which were made up of local Bosnian Muslims. In a January 1878 report, the Austro-Hungarian consul stationed in the city of Sarajevo, Konrad von Wassitsch, noted to his Vienna superiors that &quot;Ottoman administrative bodies have no authority, and the population has lost its confidence in the government.&quot; By spring of 1878, the Ottoman Army in the vilayet was in such a state of disarray that many troops deserted after being left to their own means. As a consequence, an estimated three thousand armed deserters were roaming the countryside in small bands, frequently terrorizing peasants. With no organized force implementing the law, groups of outlaws operated with impunity in many rural areas, effectively seizing control of significant territories.

====Treaty of San Stefano====

By late winter of 1878, it became clear that Ottoman authority in the area was weakened. The Treaty of San Stefano, imposed on 3 March 1878 by Russia upon the defeated Ottomans, confirmed it. Among other provisions, it stipulated that there would be full independence from the Ottoman Empire for the principalities of Serbia and Montenegro, &quot;de jure&quot; autonomy (&quot;de facto&quot; independence) within the Ottoman Empire for the Principality of Bulgaria, and autonomous province status for the Bosnian Vilayet within the Ottoman Empire. 

The Muslim population of the Bosnia Vilayet welcomed the promised greater autonomy thus rekindling their autonomy aspirations. However, international reaction to the treaty was mostly negative. The Great Powers, especially British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, were unhappy with the extension of Russian power, while Austria-Hungary was also disappointed as the treaty failed to expand its influence in the Bosnia Vilayet. In a 21 April 1878 memorandum to the European powers, the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister Gyula Andrássy proposed his Bosnia policy, making a case for a Habsburg occupation of Bosnia Vilayet. He argued that an autonomous Bosnia within the Ottoman Empire lacked the means to overcome internal divisions and maintain its existence against its neighbours. The United Kingdom supported Austria-Hungary&#x27;s aspirations in Bosnia.

Many of the smaller nations also had objections to the San Stefano Treaty—although satisfied with receiving formal independence, Serbia was unhappy with the Bulgarian expansion, Romania was extremely disappointed as its public perceived some of the treaty stipulations as Russia breaking the Russo-Romanian pre-war agreements that guaranteed the country&#x27;s territorial integrity, and the Albanians objected to what they considered a significant loss of their territory to Serbia, Bulgaria and Montenegro. Besides Bosnian Muslims, Bulgaria was the only nation happy with the treaty.

====Local reaction to the prospect of Austro-Hungarian occupation====
Because of its almost universal rejection by the global powers, the San Stefano Treaty was never implemented, and in the end only set the stage for a conference organized by German Empire chancellor Otto von Bismarck three months later in Berlin. Uncertainty over San Stefano brought about rumours of imminent Austro-Hungarian occupation in Sarajevo as early as April 1878, well before the Berlin Congress, evoking different responses from the city&#x27;s various ethnicities and classes.

Bosnian Croats welcomed the notion of being occupied by their Roman Catholic co-believers, Austrians and Hungarians, while Bosnian Serbs on the other hand, were universally opposed to it, finding little reason to cheer the replacement of one foreign occupier with another — Serbia&#x27;s old nemesis, the Habsburg Monarchy.

Bosnian Muslim reaction to the prospect of Austro-Hungarian rule was divided along social lines. Hoping that a smooth transfer of power would enhance their value to the new rulers and help preserve their privileged status and property rights, wealthy and influential landowners, despite being closely tied to the officials of the waning Ottoman regime, were now open to Austro-Hungarians. On the other hand, most of the Muslim religious authorities and lower-class Muslim population were stridently opposed, seeing nothing good in being ruled by a foreign non-Muslim power that had no plans to grant autonomy to Bosnia. 

This economic class divide among the Bosnian Muslims on the Austro-Hungarian issue was clearly evident around Sarajevo in spring 1878. Members of Sarajevo&#x27;s Muslim landowning elite showed public support for the Austro-Hungarian occupation at a meeting in April 1878 at the Emperor&#x27;s Mosque, reasoning, as one cleric put it, that &quot;&quot;it was evident the Ottoman Empire had neither the power nor the support to rule the land&quot; before further asserting that &quot;a ruler who cannot control his land also loses claim to his subjects&#x27; obedience and since no Muslim would want to be a subject of Serbia or Montenegro, Austria-Hungary is the only viable alternative&quot;&quot;. It didn&#x27;t take long for the lower-class Muslim hostility to a possible Habsburg rule to surface. as in April and May 1878 a petition called the Allied Appeal written by two Islamic conservative religious officials from the Gazi Husrev-bey Mosque&#x27;s madrasa — effendi Abdulah Kaukčija and effendi Muhamed Hadžijamaković — were circulated in Sarajevo marketplaces. In addition to urging the population of Bosnia to unite in opposing the possible Austro-Hungarian occupation, the petition bore the imprint of Islamic religious conservatism, advocating making shari&#x27;a the exclusive law of the land, demanding the dismissal of all Christian officials from the still-ruling Ottoman service, appealing for formation of an assembly to control the government, calling for removal of bells from the recently built Serb Orthodox Cathedral, and requesting demobilization of Ottoman troops. The petition reportedly included some five hundred signatures, but most Muslim landowners refused to sign it.

Reflecting personal politics and worldviews of two Sarajevan Islamic conservatives, well-respected in the local Muslim community, the petition reportedly also became a tool in the rivalry among the Ottoman officials in Bosnia. According to the Austro-Hungarian consul Wassitsch, the Ottoman governor in the Bosnian Vilayet Ahmed Mazhar Pasha planned to use the petition to gain popular support in a bid to keep his post in the event of Bosnia Vilayet acquiring autonomy as specified in the San Stefano Treaty. Mazhar&#x27;s biggest obstacle in this regard was his own deputy Konstan Pasha, a Greek man of Orthodox faith who was uniformly described amongst the foreign consuls in Sarajevo as the only Christian to hold high office in the Ottoman civil administration in Bosnia. The petitioners&#x27; demand to eliminate all Christians would thus have removed Konstan from office and secured the Muslim Mazhar&#x27;s post had the San Stefano agreement been implemented.

When several upper-class Muslims as well as some Serbian Orthodox leaders learned of the petition, they urged its redrafting without the explicitly anti-Christian demands, which was done, and a new version, written by an Ottoman official, began to circulate. The new petition, formally submitted to governor Mazhar on 2 June 1878, was seen as a win for the leading Muslim landowners who managed to purge it of its anti-Christian and anti-reform provisions. Its only two points were now a demand that a popular assembly rule the land and an appeal to all groups to unite in opposition to Austro-Hungarian occupation.

====Formation of the People&#x27;s Assembly====
In the days following the petition&#x27;s formal submission to the Ottoman governor, members of Sarajevo&#x27;s Muslim elite built consensus among the factionalized local players. They managed to persuade representatives of lower-class Muslims, including religious leaders, to join a single all-Muslim assembly, and succeeded in getting governor Mazhar to allow the assembly to meet in the government headquarters building, the Konak.

The new body, called the People&#x27;s Assembly (&quot;Narodni odbor&quot;), met for the first on 5 June with an all-Muslim membership consisting of thirty individuals from the Muslim landowning elite and thirty lower-class Muslims (religious functionaries, artisans, and shopkeepers). In an appeal to the central Ottoman government, the assembly blamed Bosnia&#x27;s woes on Istanbul&#x27;s mismanagement and the government&#x27;s failure to respond to individual complaints. The assembly&#x27;s address continued by claiming that the distant government had driven them to form their own representative body to address local needs with local officials, and warned that the population would defend their land with their lives in the event of a war. It was necessary, the appeal went on, to retain permanent garrisons of Ottoman troops in the Bosnia Vilayet, and in any case the government could neither feed nor clothe its own troops. Finally, the appeal protested the punishment of deserters and their families.

In its very first week, the assembly underwent four changes in composition as elite Muslims sought a formula that would include all ethnic, religious and financial class groups yet preserve their own dominance. On 8 June, the all-Muslim assembly appealed to Ottoman authorities to recognize a representative body of twelve Muslims, two Catholics, two Orthodox, and one Jew, all of them from Sarajevo, plus one Muslim and one Christian delegate from each of the six administrative districts (&quot;kotars&quot;) in the Bosnian Vilayet — a proposed composition that followed the makeup of the regional council, the consultative body formed in the 1860s that had governed city of Sarajevo since 1872. According to the proposal, matters affecting a single religion were to be handled by delegates from that group, and common matters would be decided in plenary sessions. Governor Mazhar approved the assembly&#x27;s new composition after consulting with the regional council.

The reconstituted, now multireligious, People&#x27;s Assembly had its first meeting on 10 June in the Konak. Serbian Orthodox nominees originally refused to participate, claiming that the scheduled meeting fell on an Orthodox holiday, however, after the date was changed, they agreed to participate but declined to take an active role. At the first meeting, Serbian Orthodox representatives claimed they were underrepresented and the assembly honoured their request by inviting the Sarajevo Serbian Orthodox Commune to name three more delegates. The three selected were Risto Besara, Jakov Trifković, and Đorđe Damjanović. Still, though the Muslim lower classes were represented, most of the assembly members from all confessions came from the small group of local upper class leaders who enjoyed honorary Ottoman titles and close ties to the government.

Wealthy Muslim landowner effendi Sunulah Sokolović who was also the regional council member was chosen as the People Assembly&#x27;s president. Other Muslim members included Mustaj-beg Fadilpašić (son of the wealthy landowner and political leader Fadil-paša Šerifović), Mehmed-beg Kapetanović (wealthy landowner who came to Sarajevo from Herzegovina), effendi Mustafa Kaukčija, effendi Ahmet Svrzo, effendi Ragib Ćurčić, etc. Serbs were represented by merchant Dimitrije Jeftanović and effendi Petraki Petrović. Croats had friar Grga Martić and Petar Jandrić. And finally Jews were represented by effendi Salomon Isaković who made a good living by selling provisions to Ottoman troops.

Steered along and finessed by the Muslim upper class members who had the most representation and influence, all the while avoiding divisive topics, the assembly managed to cobble together minimum unity and consensus throughout the month of June 1878. The big test would prove to be coming up with a coherent reaction to the decisions of the Berlin Congress that was simultaneously taking place.

====Treaty of Berlin====

At the Berlin Treaty negotiations, the Austro-Hungarian side was represented by the k. und k. foreign minister, count Gyula Andrássy, who was keen to expand the Imperial and Royal influence in the Balkans.

As a show of force and statement of intent, simultaneously with the start of the treaty negotiations in mid June 1878, the Austro-Hungarian Army began a major mobilization effort with more than 80,000 troops on its southeast border, ready to go into Bosnia Vilayet. For this action, the Austro-Hungarian authorities made a point of predominantly stacking their troops with k. und k. subjects of South Slavic origin — ethnic Croats and ethnic Serbs — feeling the Bosnia Vilayet population wouldn&#x27;t be as outraged with the occupation after seeing their own kin amongst the invading troops.

On 28 June 1878, the terms and stipulations of the Treaty of Berlin were announced and according to its 25th point, Austria-Hungary received a mandate to &quot;occupy and administer the Bosnian Vilayet&quot;, but not to annex it. The treaty thus officially nullified the provision of the San Stefano Treaty that foresaw autonomy for the Bosnian Vilayet.

===Austro-Hungarian takeover===
Austria-Hungary asserted its intent to occupy Bosnia vilayet in a telegram from Andrassy&#x27;s foreign ministry received by the k. und k. consul in Sarajevo Konrad von Wassitsch on 3 July with Ottoman officials in the Konak also learning of the impending occupation from telegrams that arrived shortly after Wassitsch&#x27;s. To some, such an open manner of announcing the Berlin Treaty&#x27;s occupation terms was indicative of Vienna&#x27;s assumption that they would be welcomed with open arms by the local population.

====Local reaction to the Berlin Treaty====
By the next morning, city was abuzz with rumours and trepidation as Wassitsch made rounds to visit with upper-class Muslim landowners and the main leaders of the local People&#x27;s Assembly, Mehmed-beg Kapetanović, Sunulah Sokolović, and Mustaj-beg Fadilpašić, reminding them of the generous benefits that would come to those loyal to the new regime. Each of the three promised to work toward a peaceful reception for k. und k. troops, though at the same time expressing fears of a lower-class uprising in opposition to new occupiers. Later that day Wassitsch went to see Ottoman governor Mazhar who told him he would support armed resistance to Austro-Hungarian rule unless he received orders from Istanbul to the contrary. At a regional council meeting the same day, Mazhar called on the councilors to support a resistance movement. This created a strange situation with Sokolović, president of the People&#x27;s Assembly and a member of the regional council, taking the unusual step of opposing the governor&#x27;s recommendation by advocating peaceful transition of power to Habsburg officials while Fadilpašić and Kapetanović backed him at the same meeting. Public demand for resistance among the lower-class masses was in evidence during the same day as a large green flag was hoisted in the courtyard of the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque.

The next day, 5 July, following noontime prayers Muslim worshipers lingered in the surrounding streets as they listened to local rabble-rouser Salih Vilajetović, better known around the city as Hadži Lojo, deliver a stirring speech in which he called for Wassitsch and the rest of the Austro-Hungarian consulate staff to be expelled from the city. A tall, strong, and physically imposing 44-year-old agitator, Hadži Lojo was quite well known locally, having for years served as imam at a small Sarajevo mosque and taught religion at a trade school. He also had a history of unlawful activity having recently returned to Sarajevo after being expelled and living as a brigand for three years. Sharing both his vocation and educational background with Hadžijamaković and Kaukčija, the two Gazi Husrev-bey Mosque clerics behind the April Petition, Hadži Lojo very well understood the local Muslim political and religious culture in which he operated and skillfully exploited it to galvanize the crowd into action. Following his impassioned speech, Hadži Lojo unfurled a green flag and led the crowd from the mosque to Konak across river Miljacka to confront governor Mazhar and other Ottoman officials. The demonstrators&#x27; fury was directed as much at Sultan Abdul Hamid II as it was at the Berlin Treaty decisions, with the bellowing cry of &#x27;You can give away Stambul, but not Bosnia&#x27;. Mazhar addressed the angry mob from the Konak&#x27;s balcony, appealing on them to disperse, but after they failed to adhere he made a concession by agreeing to dismiss current the Ottoman military commander, an unpopular figure, promising that he&#x27;d be replaced with a new Sarajevo-born commander. Satisfied for the moment, the Muslims dispersed at dusk.

By 7 July, governor Mazhar heard from his Istanbul superiors, receiving only vague instructions to retain public order pending conclusion of negotiations with Austria-Hungary. Lacking firm direction, he continued to take a permissive stance towards the possibility of local armed resistance to Habsburg rule.

Crowds of local Muslim men continued their daily gatherings to demonstrate in the courtyards of Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and the Sultan&#x27;s Mosque. They wanted Sarajevan Christians and Jews to join them too, who out of concern for their safety mostly retired to their homes when the demonstrations began. Within days, on 9 July, the crowd managed to force the People&#x27;s Assembly to relocate from Konak to Morića Han across the river — a move seen as assembly&#x27;s symbolic transition from a representative body under elite Muslim control to an activist gathering under the influence of the conservative religious establishment and lower-class Muslims.

On 10 July, the crowd demanded a change in the People&#x27;s Assembly composition. so that groups claiming underrepresentation got more members. According to Wassitsch, this particular demand was instigated and pushed through by pan-Slav activists opposing Habsburg rule, leading to an increased number of Serb Orthodox members in the reconstituted assembly so that the new body consisted of 30 Muslims, 15 Serbs, 3 Jews, and 2 Croats. Most Muslim landlords abandoned the assembly within days, the only exception being Mustaj-beg Fadilpašić who was persuaded to stay and was elected as the new president.

With most upper-class Muslims gone, the assembly came under Hadži Lojo&#x27;s control. He essentially turned it into the organizing body for armed resistance to Habsburg occupation. It was divided into two committees, one to assemble troops and the other to secure provisions and funds. Seeking credibility with Ottoman authorities, Hadži Lojo assembled an armed retinue that he moved around with, even showing up in Konak to seek immunity from Mazhar for past misdeeds. After receiving it, Hadži Lojo even made the humiliated governor pay him a token cash payment in recognition of his name being cleared.

The fading Ottoman authority in Sarajevo received some reinforcements on 12 July with four battalions dispatched from Istanbul under new military commander Hafiz Pasha. With governor Mazhar Pasha&#x27;s credibility gone, commander Hafiz Pasha was now the only authority in the city. Though at first urging the local population to accept Austro-Hungarian occupation, he then sat at subsequent regional council meetings in enigmatic silence, leaving the foreign consul to ponder his personal attitude towards possible armed resistance as the invasion drew near. Although his predecessor banned the People&#x27;s Assembly meetings, Hafiz didn&#x27;t interfere when the meetings resumed on 18 July with preparations for armed resistance their only order of business as Sarajevo settled into an uneasy peace.

With the Hadži Lojo-controlled Assembly getting ready for a fight unimpeded by Ottoman authority, the Ottomans still retained the weapons and ammunition depots as confrontation between Hafiz and Hadži Lojo seemed inevitable. On 25 July Hadzi Lojo led a crowd in front of Konak demanding access to weapons depots from Hafiz, who told the crowd he would wire the request to Istanbul, which won him another 48 hours.

====Civil disorder====
On 27 July, further evidence of Austro-Hungarian invasion sparked unrest as consul Wassitch distributed copies of the Emperor&#x27;s proclamation about the occupation. In his report, Wassitch noted seeing shopkeepers closing up before noon in order to go home and claim weapons as the final assault on the Ottoman authority in the city was being prepared by Hadži Lojo. Just after noon, a crowd led by the charismatic populist leader showed up in front of the Konak where Ottoman officials and local Muslim elite had fled for protection. Local Muslim conscripts from nearby barracks deserted their units, joining the armed mob. Around 4 p.m. Hafiz&#x27;s remaining Ottoman force tried to clear the street next to the Konak building, but the crowd, now swollen with defecting soldiers, fought back as the two groups exchanged close-range fire. with an estimated twenty casualties on both sides. In the end, the Ottoman forces managed to clear the street, but were also faced with more local soldiers deserting its ranks.

As night fell on the city, Hafiz&#x27;s dwindling troops returned to their barracks while resurgent crowds outside began cutting water lines to the barracks, blocking the delivery of provisions, and cutting telegraph wires, hoping to isolate the city and prevent the Ottomans from summoning reinforcements. The People&#x27;s Assembly began a meeting at the Sultan&#x27;s Mosque that continued long into the night.

====The People&#x27;s Government is proclaimed====
At daybreak, Hafiz made one last attempt to restore his authority by leading his loyalists to the Bijela Tabija fortress high above the city, but got nowhere as more of his troops deserted. He was captured and escorted back down into the city where he was turned over to Hadži Lojo and put in jail; the crowd prevailed and by 9 a.m. took control of the Ottoman weaponry.

The same day, the crowd&#x27;s leaders, led by members of the People&#x27;s Assembly, met at the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque to proclaim the People&#x27;s Government (Narodna vlada). Despite dominant sentiment favouring the election of native Bosnians, the leaders persuaded the crowd to elect Hafiz as governor, thus providing a thread of continuity with the previous regime. Muhamed Hadžijamaković, one of the instigators of the April petition, was made the Commander of the People&#x27;s Army while an emissary was dispatched to Wassitch to assure him that no harm would come to him, to others in his consulate, or to other consuls in the city. Within hours, he received another visit from the People&#x27;s Government leaders, who asked if he wished to depart for the Adriatic coast along with the party of deposed Ottoman officials. Wassitch opted to stay.

Later that day, the two former rival and top Ottoman officials, Mazhar Pasha and Konstan Pasha, were stopped by the crowd as they departed Sarajevo for Istanbul via Mostar. While in the hands of the angry crowd, they were robbed of all their possessions and their lives were threatened. Reacting to the capture, Wassitsch proposed that all five consuls appear together at the Konak to ask that the two pashas and other prisoners be delivered to them, however the other four consuls (meeting without Wassitch because troops loyal to the crowd surrounded the Austro-Hungarian consulate) felt that any demarche involving Wassitsch was bound to inflame the crowd. Instead they agreed to send a conciliatory letter asking that the lives of the two captive Ottoman officials be spared. Just in time, Hadzi Lojo personally intervened to rescue the two officials. They both eventually reached Istanbul and returned to their careers in the Ottoman bureaucracy.

====Austro-Hungarian Army invades Bosnia====
On 29 July 1878, one day after the People&#x27;s Government was proclaimed in Sarajevo, the Austro-Hungarian Army under the command of feldzeugmeister (general) Josip Filipović, an ethnic Croat from Gospić, entered the Bosnia Vilayet at four different crossings. Filipović&#x27;s idea was to first secure the major transportation arteries and the largest towns. Approaching from the south, west, and north, the k. und k. forces planned to suppress the resistance by conquering Sarajevo, its organizing center.

In Sarajevo, the resistance fighters, overwhelmingly made up of local lower-class Muslims received some unexpected reinforcements as the local Serbs, encouraged by their religious and community leaders, began taking up arms and joining the resistance. This sudden cooperation between Muslims and Serbs contrasted remarkably with their grinding conflict of several years earlier during the Herzegovina Uprising when Serbian Orthodox &quot;kmets&quot; rose up against Muslim &quot;beys&quot;. However, according to historian Misha Glenny, the sudden alliance between Muslims and Serbs reflected a temporary coincidence of interests, rather than a basis for a future alliance.

With a force of some 80,000 soldiers in total, 9,400 of which were &#x27;occupation troops&#x27; under feldmarschallleutnant (lieutenant-general) Stjepan Jovanović, another ethnic Croat from Lika and former k. und k. consul in Sarajevo from 1861 until 1865, whose role was to move across the border from Austrian Dalmatia into Herzegovina and hold places once they&#x27;re taken by the main fighting force, Filipović&#x27;s Austro-Hungarian Army moved swiftly down through northern Bosnia, seizing Banja Luka, Maglaj, and Jajce, encountering several successful resistance ambushes along the way that slowed down their progress. On 3 August a group of hussars was ambushed near Maglaj on the Bosna river, prompting Filipović to institute martial law. Austro-Hungarian consul Wassitsch fled Sarajevo with his staff and belongings on 4 August after receiving a written directive from the revolutionary government to leave the city. He led a convoy of about one hundred consular employees and Austro-Hungarian citizens on the road to Mostar. The people&#x27;s government provided armed escorts to ward off dangers posed by Muslim irregulars along the way. Wassitsch and his entourage safely reached the border near Metković several days later. Meanwhile, feldmarschallleutnant Jovanović&#x27;s second occupying force, the 18th Division, had been advancing up along the Neretva river, capturing Mostar on 5 August. On 7 August a pitched battle was fought near Jajce and the Austro-Hungarian infantry lost 600 men.

Within days of crossing the border into Bosnia, feldzeugmeister Filipović came to the conclusion that the Austro-Hungarian &#x27;soft strategy&#x27; of capturing town-by-town is not going to work and that the aim of occupying Sarajevo would require more manpower and more brutal tactics, so he requested and received reinforcements. The k. und k. force more than tripled with 268,000 men now on the ground trying to occupy Bosnia Vilayet.

Well equipped and well informed about the towns, roads, and bridges in their path, the Austro-Hungarians heavily defeated the local resistance at the battle of Klokoti near Vitez on 16 August. Two days later they reached the outskirts of Sarajevo and began installing cannons on the hills surrounding the city.

====Battle of Sarajevo====

On the morning of Monday, 19 August around 6:30am, the Austro-Hungarian Army began its artillery bombardment of Sarajevo using 52 cannons with feldzeugmeister Filipović committing a sizable portion of the total 14,000 troops under his command for this action to the hills surrounding the city.

Then, the infantry came into the city from the western direction of Ilidža, facing a spirited resistance from some 5,000 citizens of Sarajevo who heeded a call to arms. Pushing the resistance fighters towards the more densely populated city center, gunfire welcomed the invading troops “from every house, from every window, from every doorway…even women were taking part” as close combat ensued for individual streets and houses with children also resisting in addition to women. A particularly vicious battle took place near the Ali Pasha&#x27;s Mosque with some 50 resistance fighters losing their lives with some executed right on the spot.

By 1:30pm the Austro-Hungarians essentially won the battle as the resistance fighters got pushed outside of the city towards Romanija and by early evening Sarajevo found itself under full Habsburg control. Around 5pm Filipović triumphantly marched into the Konak, the Ottoman governor&#x27;s residence, thus symbolically commencing the Austro-Hungarian era in Sarajevo and Bosnia.

The Austro-Hungarian casualties in Sarajevo were reportedly 57 dead and 314 injured. On the resistance side around 400 casualties were reported. The k. und k. principal force moved on to Herzegovina and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.

====Austro-Hungarian revenge in Sarajevo====
On 23 August, only four days after conquering Sarajevo, feldzeugmeister Filipović impaneled a special court with summary judgement authority. Over the following several days nine Sarajevo Muslims were hanged for instigating the uprising or leading the resistance against Austro-Hungarian troops.

The first condemned to death was Muhamed Hadžijamaković. While approaching the Konak to give himself up to Filipović, he was captured, then taken to a trial the same day, sentenced to death by mid-afternoon, and finally around 4 p.m. taken to be hanged from an oak tree. Though over sixty years of age, large and powerful Hadžijamaković managed to wrest a revolver from one of his captors and fire twice, injuring several guards in the ensuing struggle. Bloodied and unconscious from a knife wound, mortally wounded Hadžijamaković was hanged after sunset.

The next to be executed was Hadžijamaković&#x27;s fellow cleric and resistance leader Abdulah Kaukčija. He too received a brief hearing on 24 August before being sentenced to death by hanging the same day. Over the next few days seven more Muslim resistance fighters — Avdo Jabučica, hadži Avdaga Halačević, Suljo Kahvić, hadži Mehaga Gačanica, Mehmed-aga Dalagija, Ibrahimaga Hrga, and Mešo Odobaša — were hanged as the resistance was still gaining strength in areas outside Sarajevo.

===Austro-Hungarian rule===
The Habsburg period of Sarajevo&#x27;s history was characterized by industrialization, development, westernization, and social change. It could be argued that the three most prominent alterations made by the Habsburgs to Sarajevo were to the city&#x27;s political structure, architecture style, and education system.

====Political====
The immediate political change made by the Austrians was to do away with what were then regarded as outdated Ottoman political divisions of the city, and put in place their own system which was centered on major roads.

====1880s architectural expansion====

Unexpectedly aided by a fire that burned down a large part of the central city area (čaršija), architects and engineers who desired to modernize Sarajevo rushed to the city. The result was a unique blend of the remaining Ottoman city market and contemporary Western architecture. For the first time in centuries, the city significantly expanded outside its traditional borders. Much of the city&#x27;s contemporary central municipality (Centar) was constructed during this period.

Architecture in Sarajevo quickly developed into a wide range of styles and buildings. The Cathedral of Sacred Heart, for example, was constructed using elements of neo-Gothic and Romanesque architecture. The National Museum, Sarajevo brewery, and City Hall were also constructed during this period. Additionally, Austrian officials made Sarajevo the first city in this part of Europe to have a tramway.

====Educational====
As the Austro-Hungarians believed theirs was a far more modern and advanced nation than the Ottoman Empire, Sarajevo was quickly westernized and adapted to their standards. A western education system was implemented, and Sarajevo&#x27;s inhabitants started writing in Latin script for the first time.

===End of Habsburg dominance===
In 1908, the territory was formally annexed and turned into a condominium jointly controlled by both Austrian Cisleithania and Hungarian Transleithania.

By 1910, Sarajevo was populated by just under 52,000 people. Just four years later the most famous event in the history of Habsburg Sarajevo, and perhaps in the city&#x27;s history, occurred. The assassination in Sarajevo, in which a young Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg on their visit to the city, started a chain of events that led to World War I. At the end of the Great War and as part of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, Austria-Hungary ceased to exist. Sarajevo became part of the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

==Yugoslavia==
After World War I Sarajevo became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Though it held some political importance, as the center of first the Bosnian region and then the Drina Banovina, it was not treated with the same attention or considered as significant as it had been in the past. Outside of today&#x27;s national bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, virtually no significant contributions to the city were made during this period.

During World War II the Kingdom of Yugoslavia put up a very inadequate defense. Following a German bombing campaign, Sarajevo was conquered by the Ustase Croatian fascist Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany. On 12 October 1941 a group of 108 notable Muslim citizens of Sarajevo signed the Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims in which they condemned the persecution of Serbs organized by Ustaše, made a distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and the whole Muslim population, presented information about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity. Many of the city&#x27;s Serbs, Romani, and Jews were killed in the Holocaust bringing a sad end to the prominence of Sarajevo&#x27;s Jewish community. In 1941, the atrocities committed by the Ustase were strongly condemned by groups of Sarajevo&#x27;s citizens.

The Sarajevo resistance was led by a NLA Partisan named Vladimir &quot;Valter&quot; Perić. Legend has it that when a new German officer came to Sarajevo and was assigned to find Valter, he asked his subordinate to show him Valter. The man took the officer to the top of a hill overlooking the city and said &quot;See this city?&quot;, &quot;Das ist Valter&quot;. Valter was killed in the fighting on the day of Sarajevo&#x27;s liberation, 6 April 1945. He has since become a city icon.

Following the liberation, Sarajevo was the capital of the republic of Bosnia within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The communists invested heavily in Sarajevo, building many new residential blocks in Novi Grad Municipality and Novo Sarajevo Municipality, while simultaneously developing the city&#x27;s industry and transforming Sarajevo once again into one of the Balkans&#x27; chief cities. From a post-war population of 115,000, by the fall of Yugoslavia Sarajevo had 429,672 people.

Sarajevo hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics. They are widely regarded as among the most successful winter Olympic Games in history. They were followed by an immense boom in tourism, making the 1980s one of the city&#x27;s best decades in a long time.

==Modern==

The history of modern Sarajevo begins with the declaration of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia. The city then became the capital of the new state, as the local division of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army established itself on the surrounding mountains. That day, massive peace protests took place. In the midst of the largest one, a protester named Suada Dilberović was shot by unidentified gunmen from a nearby skyscraper.

The following three years found Sarajevo the center of the longest siege in the history of modern warfare (See: Siege of Sarajevo). The city was held without electricity, heating, water, or medical supplies. During this time, the surrounding Serb forces shelled the city. An average of 329 shell impacts occurred per day, with a high of 3,777 shell impacts on 22 July 1993.

Aside from the economic and political structures, the besiegers targeted numerous cultural sites. Thus places such as the Gazi Husrev-beg&#x27;s Mosque, Cathedral of Jesus&#x27; Heart, and the Jewish cemetery were damaged, while places like the old City Hall and the Olympic museum were completely destroyed. For foreigners an event that defined the cultural objectives of the besiegers occurred during the night of 25 August 1992, the intentional shelling and utter destruction with incendiary shells of the irreplaceable Bosnia National and University Library, the central repository of Bosnian written culture, and a major cultural center of all the Balkans. Among the losses were about 700 manuscripts and incunabula and a unique collection of Bosnian serial publications, some from the mid-19th century Bosnian cultural revival. Libraries all over the world cooperated afterwards to restore some of the lost heritage, through donations and e-texts, rebuilding the library in cyberspace.

It is estimated that 12,000 people were killed and another 50,000 wounded during the siege. Through all this time however, the Bosnian Serb army was unable to decisively capture the city thanks to the effort of the Bosnian forces inside it. Following the Dayton Accords and a period of stabilization, the Bosnian government declared the siege officially over on 29 February 1996. Most Serbs left Sarajevo in early 1996.

The next several years were a period of heavy reconstruction. During the siege, nearly every building in the city was damaged. Ruins were present throughout the city, and bullet holes were very common. Land mines were also located in the surroundings.

Thanks to foreign aid and domestic dedication, the city began a slow path to recovery. By 2003, there were practically no ruins in the city and bullet holes had become a rarity. Sarajevo was hosting numerous international events once again, such as the extremely successful Sarajevo Film Festival, and launched bids to hold the Winter Olympic Games in the city in the not so distant future.

Today Sarajevo is one of the fastest-developing cities in the region. Various new modern buildings have been built, significantly the Bosmal City Center and the Avaz twist tower which is tallest skyscraper in the Balkans. A new highway was recently completed between Sarajevo and the city of Kakanj. The Sarajevo City Center which started construction in 2008 opened early to public in 2014. If current growth trends continue, the Sarajevo metropolitan area should return to its pre-war population by 2020, with the city following soon after. At its current pace, Sarajevo won&#x27;t surpass the million resident mark until the second half of the 21st century. The most widely accepted and pursued goal was for the city to hold the Winter Olympics in 2014. The bid failed but Sarajevo managed to hold the 2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival, the second major winter sports event after the 1984 Winter Olympic Games.

The Trebević Cable Car transportation system was rebuilt following its use during 1984 Winter Olympic Games. The Trebević cable car is one of Sarajevo&#x27;s key landmarks. The cost involved was 12,109,000 euros and it was completed and opened to public on 6 April 2018. Cable cars and equipment have been donated by the Graechen ski centre in Wallis Canton, Switzerland. The new Trebević cable car contains six sitting cabins and between 11 and 13 pillars, with a capacity to transport 1,200 passengers an hour. Further monetary donations (approx 3,000,000 euros) have been made by Dutch national Edmond Offermann. The new cable car is able to transport at a faster speed then its older system.

During the development of the city in the modern era, the city experienced numerous earthquake aftershocks coming from nearby neighbour nations. Between late-2019 and 2021, Sarajevo has been hit with six aftershocks. The first three were in November 2019 from an earthquake in Nevesinje which came shortly after the Albania earthquake. On 22 March 2020, Sarajevo was hit with a weak aftershock from an earthquake in Zagreb at 6:22 AM (CET). The fifth aftershock came on 29 December 2020 from an earthquake in Petrinja. On 3 March 2021, the most recent ever aftershock was reported.

<text>Simão Pedro da Fonseca Sabrosa (born 31 October 1979), known mononymously as Simão (), is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played mainly as a left winger, with dribbling and set piece skills as primary attributes.

Having played in his country for two of the three biggest teams in the nation, Benfica and Sporting, he also spent several years of his professional career in Spain, notably with Atlético Madrid. He won the 2004–05 national championship with the first club and the 2010 Europa League with the third, amongst other accolades; he amassed Primeira Liga totals of 225 games and 87 goals over nine seasons, adding 219 La Liga matches and 26 goals in service of Barcelona, Atlético and Espanyol.

Over a 12-year span, Simão represented Portugal in two World Cups and as many European Championships, helping it finish second at Euro 2004 and reach the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup.

==Club career==
===Sporting===
Born in Vila Real, Simão started his career at Sporting CP, whose youth system had just produced Luís Figo.

During his two-year spell he played 62 competitive games with the first team, his first goal coming in his debut at only 17 in a 3–0 away win against S.C. Salgueiros.

===Barcelona===
Simão moved to FC Barcelona in the 1999 off-season on a £10 million transfer, partnering with Figo in his first year as they finished second in La Liga to Deportivo de La Coruña. On 21 October 2000, in a match remembered for his compatriot&#x27;s treatment by Barça fans on his return to the Camp Nou in the colours of new team Real Madrid, he scored in a 2–0 &quot;El Clásico&quot; win.

In 2001, after a comparatively low-key tenure at the Spanish club under manager Louis van Gaal, Simão spoke of his desire for a move back to Sporting. However, he signed with city rivals S.L. Benfica for €12 million.

===Benfica===
Simão instantly became a fan-favorite as his new team, quickly acquiring the status of captain. Also, during his six-year stint, he always finished as their top scorer, also ranking high in the global domestic charts, notably in the 2002–03 season as he scored a Primeira Liga and career-best 18 goals.

In the following campaign, Simão scored Benfica&#x27;s second goal in a 2–1 extra-time victory over FC Porto in the final of the Taça de Portugal, ending the club&#x27;s eight-year silverware drought. In 2004–05, as the side won the national championship after an 11-year wait, he played in all the matches and minutes, netting 15 times. They also reached the domestic cup final in a 1–2 loss against Vitória de Setúbal, with him scoring through a fourth-minute penalty; in the campaign&#x27;s UEFA Cup he also appeared in all the matches, netting four times including twice against Dukla Banská Bystrica in a 3–0 away win, with his team eventually reaching the round-of-32.

The 2005 summer transfer window saw Simão targeted by Liverpool in an offer worth approximately £12 million, though negotiations reportedly failed over Benfica&#x27;s increase in asking price. He continued his excellent form into 2005–06, helping his side in the UEFA Champions League campaign, where they made it to the quarter-finals. He played in eight of a possible ten matches in the tournament, including the 1–2 loss at Manchester United in the group stage, firing his team level shortly before the hour with a free kick after he himself had been fouled by Alan Smith; in the knockout stages he helped stun title holders Liverpool, unleashing an unstoppable shot into the top left-hand corner of Pepe Reina&#x27;s goal, as the Portuguese won 2–0 at Anfield and 3–0 overall.

The following year several clubs, such as Manchester United and again Liverpool also revealed interest in Simão, but he decided to stay at the Estádio da Luz.

===Atlético Madrid===

Finally, on 26 July 2007, Atlético Madrid reached an agreement to sign Simão from Benfica for a fee of €20 million. During his first two seasons, in which he was an undisputed starter, he scored seven goals apiece, as the team finished fourth in the top division on both occasions.

On 12 April 2009, Simão entered in the hundred-year history of the capital club by scoring its 4,000th goal in the league with a left-footed diagonal shot against Deportivo. In the ensuing summer he became one of Atlético&#x27;s captains for the new campaign, receiving that role from coach Abel Resino after a reshuffle; as the &quot;Colchoneros&quot; underachieved overall, he scored in the Champions League at APOEL FC in a 1–1 away draw, a goal that secured the club&#x27;s place in the season&#x27;s UEFA Europa League.

On 14 January 2010, Simão scored twice in a 5–1 home victory over Recreativo de Huelva that qualified to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey (5–4 on aggregate), including through an 83rd-minute free kick from 20 metres to decide the tie. He also grabbed an important goal in the Europa League against Galatasaray SK as the team eventually won the competition, with the player appearing in the final against Fulham.

Simão began the 2010–11 season on a high note, scoring three goals in the first seven games – notably in a 1–1 draw at Valencia CF on 22 September 2010. He also captained the side more frequently due to the absence of Antonio López, most notably in the UEFA Super Cup&#x27;s 2–0 defeat of Inter Milan, where he set up a goal for Sergio Agüero.

===Beşiktaş===
On 22 December 2010, aged 31, Sabrosa signed with Süper Lig&#x27;s Beşiktaş JK for €900,000, reuniting with Portugal teammates Hugo Almeida and Ricardo Quaresma. On 11 May 2011, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout as they won the Turkish Cup against İstanbul Başakşehir FK (4–3, 2–2 after extra time).

Simão faced his previous team in the 2011–12 Europa League round-of-16, scoring in a 1–3 loss at the Vicente Calderón Stadium (1–6 on aggregate).

===Espanyol===
Simão joined RCD Espanyol on a free transfer on 17 August 2012, signing a two-year contract. He scored his first goal with his new club on 7 December, featuring as a second-half substitute for Rui Fonte and heading in from a corner kick in an eventual 2–2 home draw against Sevilla FC.

Simão was released on 22 May 2014, alongside Joan Capdevila. In April 2015, having been inactive for ten months, he said that he was finding it difficult to attract a new club at the age of 35, and was considering the possibility of entering management.

===NorthEast United===
On 25 June 2015, Indian Super League club NorthEast United FC announced they had signed Simão as a marquee player. He captained the team in his debut match on 9 September, also scoring in the friendly with AmaZulu FC.

Initially sidelined by injury, Simão made his competitive debut on 20 October against Chennaiyin FC at the Indira Gandhi Stadium, replacing Francis Dadzie after 74 minutes and winning a last-minute penalty which he converted to open a 2–0 win which gave the team their first points of the season. On 3 November, immediately after replacing compatriot Silas, he scored a free kick to close a 1–1 draw at Delhi Dynamos FC; four days later, from the penalty spot, he decided an away win at Atlético de Kolkata.

===Post-retirement===
Simão returned to Benfica on 14 September 2017, being appointed head of international relations after longtime club and international teammate Nuno Gomes, who had just left his post as director of the Futebol Campus academy in Seixal, rejected the offer.

==International career==
Simão&#x27;s path to the Portugal national team began when he won the UEFA European Under-16 Championship in 1996. The following year he began playing for the under-18s, being a regular in the under-21 side two years later.

Simão made his full debut for Portugal at only 19 years of age, scoring on 18 November 1998 against Israel, but was not included in the squad for UEFA Euro 2000. He also did not make the list for the 2002 FIFA World Cup due to injury, but he did participate at Euro 2004 where the hosts finished in second place. He played in three of his country&#x27;s six matches, his most notable appearance coming against England in the quarter-finals: he came on as a second-half substitute and seized on Frank Lampard&#x27;s wayward pass and crossed for Hélder Postiga, who headed in unmarked scoring the equalising goal in the late minutes of the game, bringing it to extra time and an eventual successful penalty shootout, where he converted his attempt.
Simão was also selected for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, finishing fourth overall. He made six appearances in the tournament, scoring only one goal on the 24th minute against Mexico, in a 2–1 group stage win; on 1 July, in the quarter-finals, Portugal and England met again in a penalty shootout (0–0 after 120 minutes) and he helped to another victory, netting his attempt for the final 3–1.

In Euro 2008, Simão played in three of Portugal&#x27;s matches and did not find the net, as the nation was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Germany. He did finish as his team&#x27;s top scorer during the qualifying phase for the 2010 World Cup with four goals, including two in a 3–0 home defeat of Hungary.

Simão was selected for the finals in South Africa. A starter from the second group stage fixture he scored precisely in that game, through a right-footed low shot in a 7–0 rout of North Korea on 21 June 2010.

On 27 August 2010, Simão stepped down from the national squad citing personal reasons, and earned 85 caps over his 12-year spell, netting 22 goals.

==Outside football==
===Personal life===
Simão was married to Filipa Valente for ten years, before their divorce in August 2011. The couple had a daughter and a son together. In 2014, he fathered a son who was also given his name, born to Vanessa Rebelo, the ex-wife of his former Benfica teammate Bruno Aguiar.

In March 2009, Simão took leave from Atlético to aid in the search for Diogo, the four-year-old son of his elder brother Serafim, who was reported missing when playing in the sea off Matosinhos. It was later confirmed that he had drowned.

===Other ventures===
Simão launched an instructional DVD titled &quot;Como Se Faz um Campeão&quot; (&quot;How to Make a Champion&quot;), and was the protagonist of a campaign for television channel Sport TV HD. In June 2016, he began working there as pundit and interviewer. He featured on the cover of the Portuguese edition of the video game &quot;FIFA 10&quot;, and in 2010, he appeared in an advertisement for McDonald&#x27;s.

<text>Fasciotomy or fasciectomy is a surgical procedure where the fascia is cut to relieve tension or pressure in order to treat the resulting loss of circulation to an area of tissue or muscle. Fasciotomy is a limb-saving procedure when used to treat acute compartment syndrome. It is also sometimes used to treat chronic compartment stress syndrome. The procedure has a very high rate of success, with the most common problem being accidental damage to a nearby nerve.

==Indications==
Compartment syndrome is one of the conditions where a fasciotomy may be indicated. People who are likely to have injuries needing a fasciotomy include the following:
* Crush injuries
* Athletes who have sustained one or more serious impact injuries
* People with severe burns
* People who are severely overweight
* Snakebite victims, but very rarely

==Complications==
A delay in performing the procedure can lead to neurovascular complications or lead to the need for amputation of a limb. Complications can also involve the formation of scar tissue after the operation. A thickening of the surgical scars can result in the loss of mobility of the joint involved. This can be addressed through occupational or physical therapy.

==Process==

Fasciotomy in the limbs is usually performed by a surgeon under general or regional anesthesia. An incision is made in the skin, and a small area of fascia is removed where it will best relieve pressure.

Plantar fasciotomy is an endoscopic procedure. The physician makes two small incisions on either side of the heel. An endoscope is inserted in one incision to guide the physician. A tiny knife is inserted in the other. A portion of the fascia near the heel is removed. The incisions are then closed.

In addition to scar formation, there is a possibility that the surgeon may need to use a skin graft to close the wound. Sometimes when closing the fascia again in another surgical procedure, the muscle is still too large to close it completely. A small bulge is visible but is not harmful. It takes a much longer time to heal and, in some cases, takes several months.

<doc id="751282" wikidata="Q1017946" url="?curid=751282" title="Vogošća">
<text>Vogošća (Cyrillic: Bогошћа) is a town and a municipality located in Sarajevo Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The municipality is located about 6 kilometers north of the city of Sarajevo and is its secondary suburb, after Ilidža. According to the 2013 census, the town has a population of 10,568 inhabitants, with 26,343 inhabitants in the municipality.

==History==

=== Middle Ages ===
In the Middle Ages, Vogošća and its surroundings belonged to the parish of Vidogošća, and in that period the Avars and South Slavs began to penetrate this area. The characteristic of this time is the appearance of numerous cemeteries with stećci, and they were widespread in the areas of Gora, Krč, Crni Vrh, Krivoglavci, Vogošća and Svrak. All this indicated a good population density of the Vogošće area in the late Middle Ages.

=== Ottoman Period ===
In 1435, Vogošća was mentioned in a Turkish census as &quot;Gogošta&quot;, and in 1485 it also appeared under the name &quot;Vogošta&quot;. With the arrival of the Ottomans, a new territorial organization was carried out, and then Ugorsko, Uglješići, Gornja Vogošta, Tihovići and Vrapče were mentioned for the first time. During that period, part of Vogošća belonged to the Bosnian Sandžak. Then, the first large movements of the population inland appeared, which caused the population of Vogošća to grow.

=== Austro-Hungarian Period ===
With the annexation and occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary had a significant impact on the area of Vogošća, especially on the demographic characteristics, when primarily families of workers and officials from Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic began to immigrate to Semizovac, and the characteristic was that they came for temporary work.

=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===
In the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Vogošća can be said to have been a suitable place for excursions, and it was often visited by merchants and beys, some of whom also had their own cottages. In this period, the construction of the first industrial plants began, for which Vogošća later became known.

=== Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia ===
During the 1980s, the municipality of Vogošća recorded a stable and dynamic development and was recognizable by a very high level of development in the field of industry. Vogošća was known as the second most developed municipality in the former Yugoslavia, i.e. the level of national income per capita. The development of the automotive industry and the roller bearing industry, which took place in cooperation with Volkswagen from Germany and SKF-Goteborg from Sweden, contributed to such a state to the greatest extent. In the economic structure of the wider region, mining and industry represent the dominant areas of the economy. The cooperation of the municipality of Vogošća with other countries in the pre-war period was at a high level. In addition to the developed infrastructure, local and intercity traffic, Vogošća has a developed telecommunications and PTT network with its own switchboard of 12,000 numbers, and its own RTV service with a transmitter.

=== Post-War Vogošća ===
Vogošća was heavily damaged during the exodus of the Serbs who controlled that territory during the war while its Bosniak population was expelled. The Dayton Agreement provided Vogošća to be a part of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, Vogošća is rebuilding and its industries are on the rebound thanks to aid and funds, along with the construction of the military-industrial complex of the company &quot;Pretis&quot;.

== Geography ==
The municipality of Vogošća covers 72 km and is 6 km from the center of Sarajevo, 70 km from Zenica and 100 km from Tuzla, the largest consumer centers in the country. It has communication links, the main road Brod - Sarajevo - Metković, the main railway line Vinkovci (Croatia) - Sarajevo - Ploče (Adriatic Sea). The area has a developed infrastructure, electroenergy media, coal, natural gas, natural resources of the fertile valley of the Bosna River, etc. The population is optimal, and a high level of qualifications of all profiles of workers is represented.

== Industry ==

In 1948, PRETIS was founded in Vogošća as a state factory and became one of the largest and most modern ammunition factories in Europe. Together with three other military factories in 1967. became part of the holding company UNIS Sarajevo, which became the leader of the metal processing industry in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 50,000 employees. An example is the production capacity of artillery ammunition with about 1,000,000 units/year. One of those products is the well-known express cooking pot popularly called the Pretis pot.

During the socialist period, more than 11,000 workers worked at one of the largest factories of special purpose industry in the then SFRY. Today, barely around 300 people work there. After the war, the factory was divided into two parts by privatization, Unis Pretis and Pretis.

<doc id="751284" wikidata="Q247962" url="?curid=751284" title="Ilidža">
<text>Ilidža (, ) is a spa town and a municipality located in Sarajevo Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has a total population of 66,730 with 63,528 in Ilidža itself, and is a chief suburb of Sarajevo and &quot;de facto&quot; its neighborhood. It is best known for the Vrelo Bosne spring, as well as the natural environment of its surroundings and historical tradition dating back to Neolithic times. Sarajevo International Airport is located nearby.

==Geography==
Ilidža is known to have a pleasant and attractive geography. The town itself is built on fairly level ground, although it is surrounded by mountains. The biggest is Mount Igman, whose peak towers above the town. On the mountain grows the &quot;Golden Lily&quot; (&quot;Lilium bosniacum&quot;), a branch of the Lily family of flowers that is a historical symbol of Bosnia. The area is rich in flint, especially in the Butmir neighborhood.

The Željeznica river, a tributary of the Bosna, passes through the town&#x27;s center. The Bosna itself passes through Ilidža&#x27;s outskirts. Its spring, Vrelo Bosne, is found a few kilometers to the west of the town centre and is a national park. A number of smaller streams also pass through the town&#x27;s area.

A number of horticulture projects have been undertaken in the history of Ilidža. The town is today very rich in trees. The total area of the town&#x27;s parks is about 50% of that of Sarajevo, which has six times its population. In 1894, an article in a London newspaper called Ilidža &quot;One of the most beautiful places in the world&quot;.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==History==
Ilidža is one of the longest continuously inhabited regions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the 19th century, numerous archeological finds have been made in the Butmir area, dating from Neolithic times. The so-called Butmir culture, is one of the best documented Neolithic cultures in Europe of the 26th and 25th centuries BC.

During Roman times, the Ilidža area was the location of the town known as Aquae Sulphurae. This was a Roman colony, and the largest settlement in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time. Today numerous traces of Roman civilisation have been found, such as mosaics, ceramics, jewellery, coins, and even structural remains.

During the medieval period, the Ilidža area was part of the Bosnian province of &quot;Vrhbosna&quot;. &quot;Katera&quot;, one of the two original Bosnian towns mentioned by Constantine VII in &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;, was found on the ground of today&#x27;s Ilidža municipality. The disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius considered the area important enough to stop at Vrelo Bosne and build a church in the area.

The modern town of Ilidža as we know it was founded during the Ottoman rule of Bosnia. Its name derives from the Turkish word &quot;Ilıca&quot;, meaning &quot;warm thermal springs&quot;. (Ilıca is also the name of a district of Erzurum, a southeast city of Turkey. There are also Ilıca-named municipalities in the following provinces of Turkey: Samsun,
Kahramanmaraş, Antalya, Malatya, Ordu.) Numerous elements of Turkish culture found their way into Ilidža, such as a number of oriental homes from the 15th and 16th centuries that have survived to this day. Numerous mosques and bridges were also built at this time.

Ilidža, like the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, experienced industrialisation and westernization with the coming of Austria-Hungary. A railway station and tracks, hotels, and various other structures made Ilidža the most important town after Sarajevo in the region. This continued into the 1900s as Ilidža continued to grow and develop.

Before 1990, Ilidža was populated mainly by Serbs 47,21% and Bosniaks 31,58%. When the Bosnian War started in 1992, until the 1995 Dayton Agreement, the municipality was divided between Bosnian Muslims (Hrasnica, Sokolović Kolonija, Butmir) and Serb (Ilidža, Kotorac, Vojkovići, Grlica) parts. When, under the terms of the Dayton Agreement, Ilidža was placed within the territory of the Bosnian Federation, the vast majority of Serbs fled the town to live in Republika Srpska, destroying some buildings as they did so. In the process, NATO and EU observers reported about violence between those Serbs who decided to leave and ones who wanted to stay, as those who were leaving looted and set on fire not just their but also houses and property of those who were staying as well. From 1996, Ilidža was home to the headquarters of the NATO peacekeeping force IFOR (later SFOR and EUFOR) before its move to nearby Butmir in the year 2000. During this period, the hotels Terme, Srbija (Serbia), Bosna (Bosnia) and Jadran were barricaded and the area was used as NATO HQ. Today Ilidža remains a bustling, largely Bosniak-dominated town. Vojkovići and Grlica formed Eastern Ilidža Municipality which is dominated by Serbs.

==Demographics==
According to the 2013 census, the municipality had a population of 66,730 inhabitants, with 63,528 in Ilidža itself.

===Settlements===
The municipality consists of the following settlements with their respective populations:
*Buhotina – 85
*Jasen – 9
*Kakrinje – 411
*Kobiljača – 349
*Krupac – 13
*Rakovica – 1,836
*Rudnik – 377
*Sarajevo Dio - Ilidža – 63,528
*Vela – 7
*Vlakovo – 3
*Zenik – 108
*Zoranovići – 4

===Ethnic composition===
==Government==
Although a fully incorporated suburb of Sarajevo, Ilidža is its own municipality and thus has its own municipal government.

The current political parties are represented in the Municipal Assembly:

*People and Justice – 11 members
*Party of Democratic Action – 10 members
*Social Democratic Party – 4 members
*Our Party – 3 members
*Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina – 2 members
*Democratic Front – 1 member

The current municipal mayor is Nermin Muzur, elected in the 2020 local elections and serving since 23 December 2020.

==Economy==
Prior to the war, Ilidža municipality was one of the five wealthiest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and one of the ten wealthiest in the whole of Yugoslavia. The war had a devastating effect on the town&#x27;s economy, but today it has returned to its pre-war wealth. Several important local companies are based in Ilidža. The town&#x27;s economy is based on food processing, electronics, and manufacturing.

==Tourism==
Sarajevo International Airport is located just a few kilometers from the town. The region&#x27;s natural environment and historical sites are draws for tourists. 

===Banja Ilidža spa and hotel complex===
Ilidža with its historic Roman archaeological site consisting of thermae and the village of Aquae Sulphurae, the 19th century hotel complex from Austro-Hungarian period, and a modern bath and spa resort hotel, Banja Terme Ilidža, is a spa town. This, along with a rich natural heritage, makes tourism the most important parts of Ilidža&#x27;s economy. The natural environment of the area is used to the town&#x27;s advantage, attracting tourists from both abroad and from neighboring Sarajevo. There are plans for future development to enhance tourism, including hotels and a cable cars line to mount Igman as a destination for skiing and hiking.

===Vrelo Bosne===
Vrelo Bosne is one of the country&#x27;s most popular protected areas. The &quot;Rimski Most&quot; (&quot;Roman Bridge&quot;) over the Bosna river was built in the 16th century using actual Roman stones.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Ilidža is twinned with:
* Çekmeköy, Turkey

<text>Song Fight! is a weekly online songwriting and recording competition in which amateur artists are openly invited to participate. Traditionally, a title and deadline are posted each week for which participants write, record, and submit a song in MP3 format. All entries are compiled at the end of the week and links to the files are displayed on the front page for public voting, which lasts until the end of the next week. All visitors to the site are able to listen to the MP3s and are permitted one vote each. At the end of this voting period, results are posted and the next cycle (or &quot;fight&quot;) begins, meaning at any given time one fight is in the works (in that a deadline and title are available) while the previous fight is in its voting stage. Typically Song Fight! involves only one fight at a time, although in the past several have taken place simultaneously.

Winning earns you no more or less than &quot;bragging rights, satisfaction, [and] the jealous glances of strangers sitting next to you on the subway.&quot; Nonetheless, the site has inspired well over a thousand artists to enter since the competition&#x27;s inception.

All songs submitted to Song Fight! are free for download, and are catalogued and hosted indefinitely.

==History==

The original &quot;Fightmaster,&quot; Collin &quot;Narbotic&quot; Cunningham, had a site on the Dumbrella network where, similar to explodingdog, he accepted submissions of song titles and would record a song based on that title.

Song Fight! began when Cunningham declared its first fight title, &quot;Golfpunk Drives a Cadillac&quot; on June 19, 2000. Song Fight! was not open to the public for the first several fights, and was at this time populated mainly by Cunningham&#x27;s friends and internet acquaintances. The first public fight was the seventh, &quot;Zero to Phantom&quot; (January 4, 2001). This was also the fight that first featured now &quot;internet-famous&quot; artist KOMPRESSOR, often considered Song Fight!&#x27;s first musical personality to become widely notable outside the community. While host Cunningham/Narbotic was a regularly featured artist during this time, none of his entries received the most votes in a fight.

During these years, the Song Fight! community made its home on the Dumbrella message boards, also home to the forums of prominent webcomics Achewood, Wigu, Diesel Sweeties and Explodingdog, among others. In July 2001 the first official performance of Song Fight! artists was collected for the first &quot;Song Fight Live!&quot; at Hot Lunch in San Francisco, California. A highlight of the evening included an impromptu songwriting contest, in which contestants created songs on the fly to the title of the venue&#x27;s name.

On May 10, 2002, a new title was announced: &quot;Postcard&quot;. The deadline came, and passed. Months went by without an update. As the fighters became restless, &quot;side-fights&quot; began to spring up on private sites, the most prominent of them held by participant &quot;Spud&quot; of prolific Song Fight! ensemble Octothorpe. Known as &quot;Mean While!&quot;, this side-contest eventually became more regular and (as a result) more attractive than waiting for an update from the original. Narbotic updated one full month after the announcement of &quot;Postcard&quot; with optimistically-titled &quot;The Return&quot;, the entries from which were never actually posted.

Mean While!&#x27;s administrator, in conjunction with participant &quot;JB&quot; of the one-man John Benjamin Band, moved the contest to SongFight.org, asking Cunningham to create a redirect to that location from SongFight.com, the original address, a request that was eventually granted. JB, having previously purchased the rights to the .net and .org addresses to protect them from squatters (and to begin a Song Fight! webring at the .net location), agreed to host the site while Spud became responsible for the code and aspects of the site&#x27;s upkeep and administration. The two now officially host and help to administer Song Fight! in cooperation, though the source of the titles is repeatedly said to be an unknown individual called only &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the famous informant from the Watergate scandal. Songs from Mean While! (beginning June 28, 2002) have now been incorporated into the Song Fight! archives, along with all entries from Narbotic&#x27;s period of administration.

From 2020 thru 2023, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing difficulties with organizing live shows, the Song Fight! Live events have been hosted online, with archives hosted on the Song Fight! YouTube channel.

==Current status==
As of mid-2020, Song Fight! has conducted more than 850 fights and is host to more than 12,000 entries.

&quot;Cover art&quot; is also accepted for each fight, though it is not a separate &quot;art fight&quot; in that no voting process occurs. The submission of fight art is considered more of a service than a competition. Fight art is a reference to the earliest days of Song Fight!, when Explodingdog artist Sam Brown produced much of the artwork for each week&#x27;s fight. There is also an archive of all submitted artwork.

==Notable participants==
The following artists originated on, or have participated in Song Fight!.
* Brad Sucks 
* KOMPRESSOR
* MC Frontalot (has also entered as Urine Luck and Rapper Name Redacted, and was the lead singer of Duboce Triangle and Milwaukee Youth Center Choir)
* MC Hawking
* The Spinto Band (as Carol Cleveland Sings)
* Duncan Pflaster (as Level Nivelo)

<text>Centar (Cyrillic: Центар, lit. ”Center&quot;) is a municipality of the city of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located between the older parts of the city under Stari Grad, and the newer more modern parts of the city under the municipalities Novi Grad and Novo Sarajevo.

The Centar municipality is the administrative, business, commercial, cultural, educational, and medical centre of Sarajevo. Although some of these may be disputed, Centar is certainly the most important part of Sarajevo, housing most major branches of the city and national governments.

The municipality of Centar occupies 3,313 hectrates of land, of which close to 17% is housing. The amount of private and state owned land is nearly equal, with 1600 and 1713 hectrates respectively. The municipality celebrates May 2 as &quot;Centar Municipality Day&quot;, in commemoration of the heroic defense by citizens of the aggressor&#x27;s assault on the Building of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Centar is also home to many Olympic complexes such as Mirza Delibašić Hall and sports venues Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium and Zetra Olympic Hall.

==History==
The Siege of Sarajevo had a tremendous effect on Centar. Prior to the aggression, Centar municipality had 79,000 citizens, of which the majority were Bosniaks. 7,000 citizens of the municipality were killed by the aggressors during the war, as major battles took place on its grounds. There was also a heavy presence of land mines in the area, however in December 2003 the government succeeded in clearing all land mines from the area. Since the end of the war, the municipality has received 12 major awards, indicating its current well-being and prosperity.

<text>Owen Lee Hargreaves (born 20 January 1981) is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He was known as a hard-working and &quot;solid defensive midfielder who worked tirelessly to win the ball&quot; and provide his teammates with possession. He played with Calgary Foothills as a youth before beginning his professional football career in Germany with Bayern Munich. After seven years with the Munich side – during which time he won four German league titles and the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League – Hargreaves signed for Manchester United in 2007, winning the Premier League and UEFA Champions League in his first season. However, his time at Manchester United was thereafter plagued with injuries and he was allowed to leave the club at the end of his contract in June 2011. Hargreaves posted YouTube videos in a bid to convince potential suitors of his fitness, and in August 2011, Manchester City offered Hargreaves a one-year contract, which he accepted, but he was released at the end of the season after just four appearances for the club.

As a Canadian citizen with a Welsh mother and an English father, Hargreaves was eligible to represent Canada, Wales or England. Hargreaves initially played for Wales, and was capped three times for the Wales under-19 team, but then opted to play for the England under-21 team in 2000 and was capped by the senior squad the following year. He is the only player to have played for England without having previously lived in England, and only the second, after Joe Baker, to have done so without having previously played in the English football league system.

==Early life==
Hargreaves was born in Calgary, Alberta, as the youngest of three children of Margaret and Colin Hargreaves, who had emigrated from the United Kingdom at the start of the 1980s. His father played football for the Bolton Wanderers youth side and also for the Calgary Kickers of the Canadian Soccer League. He is the only member of his family born in Canada; his brother Darren and his mother were both born in Wales, and his other brother Neil and his father were born in England.

As a youngster in North America, in addition to football, Hargreaves grew up watching and playing sports like basketball, ice hockey, and American football. His sporting heroes were basketball legend Michael Jordan and American football player Deion Sanders.

==Club career==

===Bayern Munich===
Hargreaves tried out for Bayern Munich in October 1996. Hargreaves moved at the age of 16 from Calgary Foothills to Bayern Munich on 1 July 1997. He played in the Under-19 team for two and a half years before spending nine months with the Amateur team. While with the Under-19s the team reached the final of the German Championship in 1998. They lost in the final to Borussia Dortmund, but only after a penalty shoot-out in Dortmund&#x27;s Stadion Rote Erde.

On 12 August 2000, Hargreaves played in his first Bundesliga match against Hertha Berlin, making an appearance as a substitute for Carsten Jancker in the 83rd minute. His first start came against SpVgg Unterhaching on 16 September 2000. That season the club were Bundesliga champions and also won the UEFA Champions League, with Hargreaves starting the final in central midfield. Hargreaves is one of only three English players to have won a Champions League medal with a non-English club, alongside two-time winner Steve McManaman (who won the Champions League with Real Madrid in 1999–2000 and 2001–02) and Jude Bellingham(who won the Champions League with Real Madrid in 2024).

In the 2001–02 season Hargreaves established himself as a first team regular. He made 46 appearances in all, with the club finishing third in the Bundesliga, making the quarter-finals of the Champions League and being defeated in the DFB-Pokal by Schalke. The club regained their Bundesliga title in 2002–03, along with the DFB-Pokal. On 26 January 2003, Hargreaves scored his first Bundesliga goal in the game against Borussia Mönchengladbach.

2002–03 saw Hargreaves out injured on three occasions. In September he tore a thigh muscle, then in October a calf muscle. Towards the end of the season adductor problems meant he missed a further three weeks. Altogether he made 25 Bundesliga appearances, four in Cup games and three in the Champions League.

The 2003–04 season was Hargreaves&#x27; first with Bayern without winning any silverware. After clinching the double the year before, the Bavarian side finished second in the Bundesliga, and were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid. Hargreaves made a total of 38 appearances for the club in this season.

In 2004–05 Hargreaves picked up another German championship and DFB-Pokal. He made 27 appearances in the Bundesliga (one goal), played in three Cup games (two goals) and eight Champions League games. In the 2005–06 season, he added another Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal title. Hargreaves scored the first goal at the new Allianz Arena in a competitive match on 5 August 2005, against Borussia Mönchengladbach. In all, he made 15 league appearances (one goal), four cup appearances (two goals) and three Champions League appearances. In October 2005, he extended his contract at Bayern for another four years.

In the 2006–07 season, Hargreaves broke his leg, which kept him out of most of Bayern&#x27;s league campaign that season. He recovered in time to take part in Bayern&#x27;s victory over Real Madrid in the Champions League, progressing after an aggregate score of 4–4 thanks to their two away goals in the 3–2 defeat in the first leg at Madrid&#x27;s Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. However, Bayern were knocked out in the quarter-final by Milan and finished fourth in the Bundesliga, missing out on Champions League football for the first time since 1996. In total he played 145 top-flight matches in Germany for FC Bayern.

===Manchester United===
On 31 May 2007, it was announced that Hargreaves would join Manchester United on 1 July 2007, after almost a year of negotiations between Bayern Munich and United for a fee of around £17 million. Hargreaves was finally unveiled as a United player on 1 July, having signed a four-year contract with the club. He was then revealed to the press on 9 July, along with fellow newcomer Nani. Hargreaves was given the number 4 shirt at Old Trafford.

Hargreaves made his first United appearance in a friendly against Peterborough United on 4 August, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 3–1 victory. He made his first Premier League appearance in United&#x27;s third game of the season, in the derby match away to Manchester City in a 1–0 defeat. Hargreaves scored his first league goal for United against Fulham on 1 March, a free kick from just outside the penalty box. He scored his second league goal for the club on 13 April, a free kick winner against Arsenal. In his first season with United they won the Premier League and Champions League titles. In the Champions League final, Hargreaves played all 120 minutes, starting on the right of midfield, and scored United&#x27;s fourth penalty of the shootout as they defeated Chelsea 6–5 on penalties.

The start of Hargreaves&#x27; second season at United was hampered by injury, a recurring patellar tendinitis problem that restricted him to sporadic appearances in 2008–09. After trips to specialists in both London and Sweden yielded no results, Hargreaves travelled to Colorado, USA, in November 2008 to visit renowned knee surgeon, Richard Steadman. Hargreaves underwent surgery on his right knee on 10 November and received a similar operation on his left knee in January 2009. However, this meant that he would miss the remainder of the 2008–09 season, ultimately meaning he would miss out on a second Premier League title as well as League Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and FA Community Shield winner&#x27;s medals. Hargreaves underwent his rehabilitation programme in the United States, and was due to return to training with United at the Audi Cup in Munich. However, upon assessment, it was decided that he should continue with his rehabilitation in the United States. Hargreaves returned to the club on 23 September 2009, joined by his physiotherapist for a week to aid the transition process and for the club to understand his rehabilitation programme.

In January 2010, it was speculated that Hargreaves was slated to return in time for United&#x27;s Champions League first knockout round tie against Milan, despite not being fully match-fit. However, on 4 February, Hargreaves suffered a major setback to hopes of playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup as Alex Ferguson omitted him from the squad for the knockout stage in favour of Belgian defender Ritchie De Laet. It was expected that Hargreaves would make his return from injury in a reserve team match against Manchester City on 11 March, but on the day of the match, Hargreaves pulled out of the game to continue with his training regime. He eventually made his comeback a week later, playing for 45 minutes of United&#x27;s reserve team match against Burnley on 18 March. On 24 April, Hargreaves was named as an unused substitute for the first-team match against Tottenham Hotspur.

On 2 May 2010, Hargreaves made his Premier League return in the 93rd minute of United&#x27;s penultimate game of the season against Sunderland. It was his first Premier League action since a 1–1 draw with Chelsea in September 2008, in which time he had missed 113 matches in 20 months. Despite this, Hargreaves missed the beginning of the 2010–11 season, having suffered another injury, for which he travelled to the United States to see a specialist. On 24 September, manager Ferguson announced that Hargreaves had returned to training. On 6 November 2010, he made his first start since September 2008 against Wolverhampton Wanderers, however it was short-lived after a hamstring injury forced his withdrawal for Bébé just five minutes into the match, which United went on to win 2–1.

On 22 May 2011, Ferguson confirmed that the club would not offer Hargreaves a new contract. His contract expired at the end of the 2010–11 season and he left the club, despite offering to play the 2011–12 season for free. Hargreaves later posted videos on YouTube of him exercising, in order to prove his fitness to potential clubs. Buoyed by Richard Steadman&#x27;s optimistic assessment that Hargreaves&#x27; knees, a source of injury for a number of years, could withstand the impact of &#x27;jumping from the Eiffel Tower&#x27;, a number of clubs including Bolton Wanderers Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur, Leicester City, West Bromwich Albion, Nottingham Forest Queens Park Rangers, Rangers, and &quot;several MLS clubs&quot;, were believed to be considering an offer for Hargreaves. In Ferguson&#x27;s autobiography released in 2013, he called Hargreaves one of his most disappointing signings. In 2020, ESPN ranked his transfer to United as the 27th worst Premier League transfer of all time.

===Manchester City===
On 30 August 2011, Hargreaves was pictured supposedly having a medical with Manchester City doctor Phillip Batty ahead of a move to the club. City had been looking for a replacement for Patrick Vieira who retired the season before and an additional midfielder due to Yaya Touré&#x27;s anticipated absence during January 2012 because of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. They had earmarked Daniele De Rossi, Fernando Gago and Mark van Bommel but when these approaches failed, City turned to Hargreaves – a player they had been looking at for a few months prior to their initial approach.

On 31 August 2011, City confirmed that they had signed Hargreaves on a one-year deal. It was expected Hargreaves would join West Bromwich Albion, but the City offer came as a surprise. The move offered Hargreaves an opportunity for Champions League football as the club looked to challenge United for the Premier League. However, he was left out of the Champions League squad. Hargreaves made his City debut against Birmingham City in the League Cup, and opened the scoring in a 2–0 victory with a goal in the 17th minute. On 27 April 2012, it was confirmed that he would be released at the end of the season after just four appearances for the club. City were to be victorious in the Premier League, winning their first English title for 44 years, with Hargreaves being involved in the on-pitch celebrations after defeating Queens Park Rangers on the final day. However, after only playing one league match all season, he did not qualify to receive a winner&#x27;s medal.

Following his release, he trained with Queens Park Rangers, but was not offered a contract by the club.

==International career==
Born in Canada to a Welsh mother and an English father, Hargreaves was eligible to play international football for England, Wales or Canada. Hargreaves was not selected to play for the Canada U-17 World Cup team, despite being a promising youth player who trialled for Bayern Munich and was about to sign a contract with them. Hargreaves drew the ire of soccer fans in Canada for choosing to play for England. One fansite went to the lengths of demanding that the three Canadian teams in MLS (Montreal Impact, Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps) never sign Hargreaves to play for them, after he was courted by the Vancouver Whitecaps in 2010.

===Wales===
He represented Wales at the 1998 Milk Cup where Wales finished in third place behind Turkey and Northern Ireland, but finished above Russia. He was set to make his début for the Wales U21 team against the Belarus U21 team in September 2000 but pulled out of the squad after he was approached by England.

===England===
On 31 August 2000, the then England under-21 manager, Howard Wilkinson, called the 19-year-old into his squad for the match against Georgia. The game, played at the Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough, ended in a 6–1 win for the home team. Further appearances for the under-21s followed in friendlies against Italy and Spain.

Hargreaves played his first full international game on 15 August 2001 against the Netherlands at White Hart Lane, giving him the distinction of being the only player to appear for England despite having never lived in England. He was also the second player (after Joe Baker) to have appeared for England without having played in English league football and the first to appear for England without having played in Britain. In only his second cap he came on as a substitute as England famously beat Germany 5–1 in the Olympiastadion. Hargreaves was the only player playing outside the Premier League to be selected for England&#x27;s 2002 FIFA World Cup squad. Hargreaves was injured after just fifteen minutes of England&#x27;s second group game against Argentina and had to be substituted.

Although he had not usually been part of the first-team, he was selected for the England squads at Euro 2004 in Portugal and the 2006 World Cup in Germany despite criticism from sections of the press and public. The generally negative perception of him by English fans had not been helped by his seeming to have an essence of &quot;German-ness&quot;, exacerbated by his Canadian accent and fluency in German. While restricted to three appearances as a substitute at Euro 2004, Hargreaves was in the starting lineup of England&#x27;s final three matches in 2006. In a tournament in which England were generally regarded as having underachieved, he was, by the end of England&#x27;s participation, widely considered one of the few successes of the English squad. He was named Man of the match in the quarter-final against Portugal, the game in which England were eliminated after a penalty shootout, Hargreaves having been the only successful English penalty taker. In 2006, he won both England Player of the Year, and England Player of the World Cup in official FA polls, the first to win both in the same year.

Hargreaves picked up the Man of the match award in England&#x27;s 4–0 win over Greece on 16 August 2006. On 30 January 2007 he was voted England Player of the Year 2006, as voted for by visitors to the Official FA site.

In June 2007, FIFA announced that Hargreaves and Philipp Lahm would visit South Africa in advance support for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

After his transfer to Manchester City in 2011, England coach Fabio Capello hoped that Hargreaves would regain his fitness saying &quot;I hope he will be really good in the short-term for Manchester City and also for England.&quot;

==Injury history==
Hargreaves&#x27; career was affected by injuries, the bulk of which formed in 2006, the year he won the award for England&#x27;s best player at the 2006 World Cup. Hargreaves stated that he believed the bulk of his injury problems to have been in 2007, when he returned from injury after breaking his leg. He felt that his muscle in his leg was weaker than before he sustained his broken leg, and initially Hargreaves ignored the aching and played on.

It emerged by 2008 that Hargreaves was suffering from a problem with his patella tendon and this was eventually narrowed down to patellar tendinitis. Surgeon Richard Steadman stated that Hargreaves knees were in a worse state than any other he had come across in his 35 years of experience. After numerous operations on both his knees, Steadman said in September 2010 that Hargreaves&#x27; problems with his knees were over but Alex Ferguson denied this. In November 2010, Hargreaves made his first start for Manchester United in 777 days, but limped off after six minutes.

In 2011, Manchester United did not renew his contract due to his injury troubles. Speculation rumbled about Hargreaves retiring due to his injuries but determined to prove himself, he uploaded YouTube videos of himself training to convince potential clubs of his fitness. His determination to carry on despite chronic injury won him admirers.

After his move to Manchester City, Hargreaves stated that he felt like &quot;a guinea pig&quot; during his time on the treatment table at Manchester United. He believed that his prolonged trouble with injuries were due to the revolutionary treatments he was forced to undergo in an effort to solve a problem he felt had been exacerbated by the injections. Alex Ferguson has rejected these claims.

==Media career==
Hargreaves appears as a pundit for TNT Sports as part of their Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League coverage. He is also a Football Analyst on news channel CNN, and has covered the Euro 2016 competition in France.

<text>Skenderija is a cultural, sports and trade centre located in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In boasts an area of 70,000 square meters, with multipurpose halls for various sports, with concert and cultural venues, and with trade areas which include the outdoor square. Additionally, a modern shopping centre called &quot;Privredni grad&quot; (English: &quot;Trade City&quot;) with numerous confectionery shops, restaurants, coffee bars, and other spaces is located at the underground level. Some of the venues include Dom Mladih, Ars Aevi, and Mirza Delibašić Hall.

== History ==

In the late 1960s, the rapidly expanding city of Sarajevo lacked an exhibition-and-sports centre, so municipal authorities approved the plan to build the new Skenderija centre. It was opened on 29 November 1969 by hosting a première of the film &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot;.

The name Skenderija, which means &quot;&quot;Skender&#x27;s place&quot;,&quot; refers to the Bosnian Sanjak-bey Skender Pasha, a historical figure who, in 1499, had built the first trading centre in Bosnia (with eleven shops), as well as the first Muslim monastery. Skenderija quickly became a well-known across Yugoslavia and frequently hosted major cultural events. One part of Skenderija is a specialized youth club called &quot;Dom mladih&quot; (&quot;The Youth House&quot;). Before the Bosnian War, this was one of the modernist and most western-styled clubs in all of Yugoslavia. It was a very popular place among young people, with some of the Balkan pop-music stars, such as Dino Merlin, having started their careers at the club. The building is also home to the biggest mall ever built in former Yugoslavia, called &quot;Privredni grad&quot;.

In 1977, after Sarajevo had won the bid to host the 1984 Winter Olympics, the organizing committee selected the centre as an auxiliary venue for the Games. However, as the venue had already become somewhat outdated by that point, a major reconstruction was ordered during which Skenderija was expanded and turned into a state-of-the-art sporting complex. Later, it was also designated to serve as the media centre for the Games, and as the venue for award ceremonies.

In 1992, at the breakout of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the Siege of Sarajevo, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army targeted Skenderija with heavy shelling. The youth centre burned to the ground, while the main structure of the building was mostly undamaged.

After the war, the centre was left abandoned and slowly fell into disrepair. In 1999, the municipal government of Sarajevo decided to rebuild Skenderija into a modern exhibition hall. The reconstruction was financed by many private companies (which now own most of the building) and was completed in 2006. Most of the facility has been restored back to its former glory and the venue is in service as of 2024. It is estimated to have over 500,000 visitors each year.

On 12 February 2012, the roof of the Skating Hall collapsed under the weight of heavy snowfall. The roof had been designed to sustain weight of up to 100 kg per square meter and gave way under estimated 160 kg of snow per square meter on that day.

==History==
Like Novi Grad, Novo Sarajevo is a product of the city&#x27;s massive growth and development in the 1960s and 1970s. It is located in the middle of the Sarajevo field, predominantly on the northern bank of the Miljacka, between Novi Grad and Centar.

Prior to the siege, Novo Sarajevo had some 47.6 km2 (41.6% Forest, 17.5% Meadows, 13.5% Commercial/Building Land, 10.4% Grass-land, 8.4% Ploghland, 13.5% Gardens). Following the siege of Sarajevo, 75% of the lesser populated urban area was transferred to Republika Srpska (established as Istočno Novo Sarajevo), leaving Novo Sarajevo municipality with 11.43 km2. As a result, Novo Sarajevo has the highest number of people per km2, some 7524.

==Economy==
Novo Sarajevo is known as something of the commercial and business center of Sarajevo, housing many of the city&#x27;s major companies and corporations such as Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine, the University of Sarajevo, UN house Bosnia and Herzegovina and also the HQ of Sparkasse Bank and the Raiffeisen Bank in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Novo Sarajevo is considered to be the second most developed municipality in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, boasting a per capita GDP of some US$11,000 (275.2% of FBiH average GDP), just behind the municipality of Centar, Sarajevo. These two municipalities combine for 60.9% of the Sarajevo Canton GDP, even though they account for merely 3.5% of the total area of Sarajevo Canton, and 27% of its population.

<text>Novi Grad (, ; lit. &quot;New Town&quot;) is a municipality of the city of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the westernmost of the four municipalities that make up the city of Sarajevo. The municipality also consists of the villages Bojnik and Rečica.

==History==
During the 1970s, Sarajevo was undergoing a rapid economic and cultural development, with great expansion focused on population and industry. Novi Grad was a direct result of this period of heavy growth, in which many acres of previously unused land were transformed into socialist urban centres filled with apartment buildings. By the time the Novi Grad municipality was formally recognized, it had some 60,000 citizens, in 18 neighbourhoods.

According to the 1991 census, the municipality of Novi Grad had 136,746 citizens. Four years of the Bosnian War brought that number down tremendously, as the Serb minority left the city. Of the municipality&#x27;s 33,517 residential buildings, 92% were damaged during the Siege of Sarajevo.

Novi Grad has since made a fantastic recovery. Although many bullet holes and mortar shell impacts are visible throughout the municipality, it is overall healthy and functioning. As the most modern part of Sarajevo, Novi Grad is also ground to many new developments, such as the Bosmal City Center.

Prior to 1914, the Austro-Hungarians who ruled Sarajevo wanted land in the Sarajevo Old Town district to build a city hall and library. The land had a home on it and, despite offering the owner money, he refused and continued to refuse even when told that he had to move. When the officials threatened him, he moved the house and rebuilt it, piece by piece, on the other side of the Miljacka river, as a way of spiting the officials. The Sarajevo spite house operates today as a restaurant, called &quot;Inat Kuća&quot;, which means &quot;Spite House.&quot;

<text>The Bosna (, ) is the third longest river in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is considered one of the country&#x27;s three major internal rivers, along with the Neretva and the Vrbas. The other three major rivers of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the Una, to the northwest; the Sava, to the north, and the Drina, to the east. This river is the namesake of Bosnia. The river Bosna flows for .

The river is possibly mentioned for the first time during the 1st century AD by Roman historian Marcus Velleius Paterculus under the name &quot;Bathinus flumen&quot;. Another basic source that is associated with the hydronym &quot;Bathinus&quot; is the Salonitan inscription of the governor of Dalmatia, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, where it is said that the &quot;Bathinum&quot; river divides the Breuci from the Osseriates. 
Another name could also have been Basante. 

According to philologist Anton Mayer, the name &quot;Bosna&quot; could be derived from Illyrian &quot;Bass-an-as(-ā)&quot;, which would be a diversion of the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;the running water&#x27;.

==Geography and sectioning==

The Bosna River has created the Bosna River Valley. The valley has been developed as the country&#x27;s industrial hub and is home to nearly a million people, who live primarily in several major cities. 

=== Vrelo Bosne and Mala Bosna ===
The Bosna source is the Vrelo Bosne spring, located at a.s.l. (according to an earlier source, a.s.l.) at the foothills of mount Igman, on the outskirts of Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The spring is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s chief natural landmarks and tourist attractions.

The course between the source and its largest tributary in this section, the Željeznica, which runs in from the right, is referred as the Mala Bosna (), but the section is often extended all the way to its confluence with Miljacka, four kilometers downstream. Its tributaries between the source and the Željeznica are first the Večerica and then Bukulaš, while in the region of extended Mala Bosna course it further receives, first the Željeznica from the right, then approx. 600 meters downstream the Zujevina, the only tributary from the left in this region, followed by the Dobrinja (a.k.a. Tilava) 1.5 km, and then 2 km further the Miljacka, both from the right.

=== Upper Bosna ===
The Upper Bosna is a section between its source and the mouth of the Lašva, a left tributary, just upstream from Zenica. The section encompasses the entire region between Ilidža, near Sarajevo, and the Lašva, including the spacious valley between Ilijaš and Kakanj. The Visoko region, with its medieval heritage, is at the center of this area. 

=== Middle Bosna ===
The Middle Bosna is mostly composed of gorges, with steep slopes and narrow passages, between Zenica and Doboj. In this section, there are several medieval sites, such as Vranduk, Maglaj and Doboj.

=== Lower Bosna ===
The Lower Bosna is the last section of the Bosna. From Doboj, the river continues northwards, approaching the Sava through the heart of Bosnia, passing through the lowlands of Posavina, and eventually becomes a right tributary of the Sava in Bosanski Šamac. There, it empties at around above the sea level.

== Course and tributaries== 
The Bosna flows through a number of cantons. From its starting point in the Sarajevo Canton, it flows through the Zenica-Doboj Canton, and the Posavina Canton, in that order. On its way north, the Bosna also passes through the cities of Visoko, Zenica, Maglaj, Doboj, Modriča and Bosanski Šamac.

The main right tributaries are: Željeznica, Miljacka, Ljubina, Misoča, Stavnja, Trstionica, Zgošća, , Krivaja and Spreča. On the left, the main tributaries are: Zujevina, Fojnica, Lašva and Usora.

<text>The Miljacka () is a river in Bosnia and Herzegovina that passes through Sarajevo. Numerous city bridges have been built to cross it.

==Characteristics==
The Miljacka river originates from the confluence of the Paljanska Miljacka and Mokranjska Miljacka rivers. The Miljacka is a rather small river, only long from the confluence, or and depending on source (Pale or Mokro). By the time this tributary flows into the Bosna river in Sarajevo, it has an average discharge of 5.7 m3/s. The Miljacka river flows from east to west in a general direction through the city.

The Bosna is a right tributary of the Sava River, with its mouth in Bosanski Šamac. That river in turn flows into the Danube River, which goes southeast and enters the Black Sea chiefly in Romania. 

===Paljanska Miljacka===
The Paljanska Miljacka, in length, begins at Gornje Pale, eastward in the town of Pale, on the slopes of Jahorina, near Begovina), at an elevation of .

===Mokranjska Miljacka===
The Mokranjska Miljacka, in length, springs from a large cave, yet to be fully explored, near the village of Kadino Selo at an elevation of near the base of Romanija mountain.

====Mokranjska Miljacka cave====
The cave at the spring of Mokranjska Miljacka, located about from the village of Mokro, near Pale, is officially the longest cave in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of August 2015, the length of mapped caverns was . The Miljacka runs out of the cave practically as an underground flow, a subterranean river, where its temperature is measured as low as 5 degrees and temperature of air as low as 8 degrees Celsius.

The exact location of the cave is not yet mapped for the public, but local authorities have released a map which can be used to find its location, as well as a gallery of discoveries within the cave.

A new species of spiders, named &quot;Nemanela Lade&quot; (&quot;Lada&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; for its discoverer, Dr. Lada Lukić-Bilela from the Institute for Genetic Technology, Sarajevo), has been found here. Also found are at least five more species of spider, as well as certain species of bats. A skeleton head of a cave bear has also been found at the location. 

Paleontological finds, traces of human habitation, stalactites and stalagmites, as well as pisolite rocks, the river Miljacka wellspring, all makes this cave among most valuable speleological objects in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Researchers believe to have discovered bubbles of air, a possible sign of tectonic activity.

==Environment==
Because of its poor discharge, the Miljacka is known for its peculiar smell and brown waters. Miljacka river cascades, which regulate the waterbed and enrich the water with oxygen, trap plastic scraps, stranded balls, car tires, and various other waste. The main collector that drains fecal matter is parallel to the flow of the river up to its mouth at the river Bosna. The sewer system is not connected to the main collector, causing leakage of fecal matter directly into the waters of the Miljacka in several places. During the Bosnian War, water treatment was stopped and plant equipment looted, preventing the local government from dealing with the issue. Estimates of the cost to repair the wastewater plant range from 50 to 60 million euros.

In April 2015, a project called &quot;Čista rijeka Miljacka&quot; (Clean river Miljacka) was presented. The aim of the project was to bring the river status to category A, which would make the water clean enough for swimming.

In August 2015, the city of Sarajevo signed a contract with ER Project d.o.o. company to clean up 48 river cascades from Šeher-Ćehaja Bridge to Dolac Malta suburb bridge.

===Floods of 2014===
The river swelled almost to the level of city bridges during the 2014 Southeast Europe floods, which brought significant flooding to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===Floods of 2021===
The Miljacka was close to submerging some bridges in Sarajevo during the 2021 Bosnia and Herzegovina floods.

==Bridges==
There are over a dozen bridges over the river Miljacka. Some of the better known ones are:

* Goat&#x27;s Bridge ()
* Šeher-Ćehaja Bridge
* Careva ćuprija
* Latin Bridge (also known as &quot;Principov most&quot;, namesake of Archduke Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s assassin Gavrilo Princip). The assassination carried out by Princip, which led to World War I, took place at the entrance on this bridge. Gavrilo&#x27;s co-conspirator Nedeljko Čabrinović, another member of the Bosnia-Herzegovinian Mlada Bosna movement, jumped into the river Miljacka from the bridge, seconds after throwing a grenade toward the archduke&#x27;s car. He intended to hide below the bridge so that he could take and swallow a cyanide powder wrapped into a piece of paper. But the poison got so wet from the fall into the shallow Miljacka (only deep) that it dissolved but lost its toxicity. Čabrinović was dragged alive from the river and arrested. 
* Ćumurija Bridge
* Drvenija Bridge
* Čobanija Bridge
* Festina lente bridge
* Skenderija Bridge (a.k.a. &quot;Ajfelov most&quot;)
* Suada and Olga bridge (a.k.a. &quot;Vrbanja most&quot;)
* Bosmal Bridge (Malaysian-Bosnian Friendship Bridge), a.k.a. &quot;Malezijski most&quot; and &quot;Bosmalov most&quot;.
* and several unnamed modern bridges.

==Diving==
Bentbaša Cliff Diving is a sport organized at location Bentbaša dam every summer at the eastern entrance into the city of Sarajevo (in close proximity to Vijećnica, a library and former City Hall). The diving location water depth is at 3.5 to 4.4 meters depending time of month. Support to this sport in Sarajevo was given by Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series champion Rhiannan Iffland and competitor Jonathan Paredes who attended the 2019 edition.

Past champions of the event:

* 2019 - Dragan Milnović (head jump) / Aleš Karničnik (high jump)
* 2018 - Igor Arsenić from Banja Luka
* 2017 - N/A
* 2016 - N/A
* 2015 - Dino Bajrić from Sarajevo

==Image gallery==
==Popular culture==
A number of popular local songs were sung about Miljacka river, including &quot;Halid Bešlić - Miljacka&quot; and &quot;Himzo Polovina - Kad ja pođoh na Bembašu&quot;.

<doc id="751300" wikidata="Q879414" url="?curid=751300" title="Bjelašnica">
<text>Bjelašnica (, ) is a mountain in the Dinaric Alps in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is to the southwest of Sarajevo, bordering Mount Igman. Bjelašnica&#x27;s tallest peak, by which the mountain group got its name, rises to an elevation of . Other notable peaks are Krvavac (), Mali Vlahinja (), and Hranisava (). The Bjelašnica range is bordered by the Rakitnica in the south, the Neretva in the west, Mount Igman in the north-east and Mount Ivan in the north-west. Only at 20 minutes distance of Sarajevo, it is a tourist attraction for hiking and skiing.

Bjelašnica was, in certain areas, the site of extensive combat during the 1992–95 Siege of Sarajevo and particular areas pose a high mine risk. There are numerous trails set up and maintained by local mountain clubs that lead to the bald peaks higher up. The mountain is also visited by mountain bikers and has become a base for some paragliders.

==Etymology==
The mountain&#x27;s name stems from the root &quot;bijel&quot;, which means &quot;white&quot;.

==Geology==
Geologically, Bjelašnica is part of the Dinaric Alps and formed largely of secondary and tertiary sedimentary rock, mostly limestone and dolomite.

==Climate and vegetation==
The white snow cupola of Bjelašnica is a familiar sight from the higher points in Sarajevo from mid-October until early June. Bjelašnica&#x27;s base is largely forested with mostly beech. However, there are no trees above the 1,500 metre tree line.

Bjelašnica has an alpine tundra climate (ET) with long, cold winters lasting for most of the year and short, cool summers. During winter, snowfall is extremely heavy and very constant, falling on most winter days.

==Weather station==
Bjelašnica summit is easily recognizable from a distance by the structures that have been erected on top of it. After the Austro-Hungarian Empire occupied Bosnia following the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Austrians installed almost immediately the first meteorological station on the summit in 1878, creating the first meteorological station in the whole area of the Balkans. This structure was replaced in 1894 by a more advanced meteorological observatory with an all-year around manning. The observatory is still there, has been repaired of the damage sustained during the Bosnian war, and still functions as an important chain-link in the meteorological survey of the Balkans. The communications centre with its landmark tower that used to stand next to the observatory was destroyed in 1993. The remains of the destroyed tower were removed in 2006.

==1984 Winter Olympics==
During the 1984 Winter Olympics, Bjelašnica hosted the men&#x27;s alpine skiing events, where brash Bill Johnson (USA) won the downhill after boldly predicting victory, overtaking Swiss ski legend Peter Müller who took silver. The American twins Phil and Steve Mahre took gold and silver in the slalom at Bjelašnica. Switzerland&#x27;s Max Julen surprisingly took the gold in the Giant Slalom, while the silver went to the Yugoslav favorite Jure Franko. Major investment was done by the Yugoslav authorities in order to accommodate the Winter Olympics. The Babin Dol area was developed for the necessary construction and a long main ski lift was built from Babin Dol up to the Bjelašnica summit. In preparation of the Games, a road was constructed across the Igman plateau connecting Sarajevo through Hadžići to the Malo Polje, Veliko Polje and Babin Dol venues. The Babin Dol area has several structures dating from that time, including the renowned Maršal (then: Famos) Hotel and most of the skiing facilities in the area. FIS World Cup events took place on 18 January 1983 and 21–22 March 1987. In 1983 it was only the downhill (winner: Gerhard Pfaffenbichler, before Steve Podborski and Franz Klammer) that was done. In 1987 contests were done in Men&#x27;s Slalom (winner: Grega Benedik) and Giant Slalom, Men&#x27;s (winner: Marc Girardelli) and Women&#x27;s (tied victory: Maria Walliser and Vreni Schneider)
Other FIS events have taken place and are still taking place at Bjelašnica.

==Bosnian War (1992–95)==
The strategic value of Bjelašnica summit, overlooking the Igman plateau, had already been recognized by the JNA and Yugoslav leadership headed by Marshal Tito. A large radar site was constructed on a subsummit of the Vlahinja ridge, while a communications centre and tower was constructed next to the weather station on the nearby Bjelašnica summit.

Bjelašnica was throughout the course of the Bosnian War an area of major strategic importance as part of the Siege of Sarajevo. The territory covered by the Bjelasnica range and the Igman plateau between Konjic and the United Nations-controlled Sarajevo Airport was from the outset of the conflict controlled by the ARBiH. By mid-1993, the central plateau of Igman came under increased Serb military pressure, when the suspicion became stronger that the area had become a major logistical artery of the besieged city, as a result of the construction of the Sarajevo tunnel.

A major VRS offensive started in July 1993 that led to the fall of Trnovo, and on 4 August 1993, Serb forces captured the Bjelašnica summit and part of the Igman supply road. The VRS advance was stopped under threat of NATO airstrikes. After tense negotiations the VRS retreated from the Bjelašnica summit, but not without blowing up the communications tower first. French United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) units were stationed on Bjelašnica, and the Igman area was declared a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) by the UN.

The situation around the frontlines in nearby Treskavica and around Babin Dol, remained explosive with violent exchanges of hostilities between VRS and ARBiH units. The villages on the southern slopes of Bjelašnica, like Umoljani and Lukavac were not in the frontline, but sustained heavy damage from shelling. Discussion about real or alleged use by ARBiH forces of the Igman DMZ was an issue of constant contention, between UNPROFOR Commander General Michael Rose, ARBiH General Rasim Delić, and VRS Commander Ratko Mladić.

By mid-1995, the military situation became very tense again, and in August 1995 the VRS launched another offensive, forcing UNPROFOR from the Bjelasnica ridge and advancing through Babin Dol towards Veliko Polje. However, after the second Markale shelling, on August, 30, NATO started Operation Deliberate Force, in which NATO aircraft engaged VRS Command &amp; Control facilities and other targets. Also the VRS-held radar station on Vlahinja ridge was completely destroyed during these air strikes that lasted until 14 September 1995, when the air strikes were suspended to allow the implementation of the withdrawal of VRS heavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone, effectively ending the Siege of Sarajevo.

===Mine risks===

Extensive de-mining activities have taken place around recreational areas and especially around the existing ski runs, which can be considered safe by all means. The largest part of the Bjelašnica range remained largely spared from warfare and the mine risk is therefore minimal within the area west of the Bjelašnica summit and east of the Hranisava mountain.

==Bjelašnica Olympic Mountain Ski Centre==
The Bjelašnica Olympic Mountain Ski Centre and its facilities are all located on the eastern slope of Bjelašnica main summit. There are 6 lifts, with one modern three-seat carrier lift departing from Babin Dol, three anchor lifts and two remaining single saucer lifts. Next to the original 3100 meter Olympic Downhill run and the Giant Slalom run there are four more pistes varying in length between 3200 and 550 meters and covering all difficulty levels between blue-red-black. A lot of investment has been done to develop the Ski Centre and the Babin Dol area since the era directly following the Dayton Agreement, with another peak during the last couple of years. New hotels, apartment complexes and restaurants have turned this area into a modern ski resort. The latest redevelopment has seen the replacement of the old ski lift with two modern ski lifts and a state of the art snow production system, ready to operate for the 2017/2018 ski season. This was done as part of the preparations for the 2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival, which was hosted by Sarajevo and Istočno Sarajevo in February 2019.

==Hiking==
The Bjelašnica range consists of basically three ridges, the Vlahinja ridge, the Strug ridge and a more southern ridge parallel to the Rakitnica and separated from the other ridges by a wide valley called Dugo Polje. A number of hikes exist in these mountains. One trail approaches the Bjelašnica main summit (2,067 m.) from the north and is called Josipova Staza after its most famous hiker: Josip Broz Tito. From the main summit a ridge walk leads north-east towards the summit of Mala Vlahinja (2,055 m.). The last summit of this ridge in the west is called Hranisava (1,964 m.) and can be better ascended to by a trail starting in the hamlet of Lokve, between Hadžići and Pazarić. This offers a hike towards a view from this most western summit of the Bjelašnica range. Another hike departs from Dugo Polje and leads via a difficultly retrieved trail through thick shrubs of Pinus Mugo the summit of Krvavac (2,061 m.). One of the hikes leads parallel to the Rakitnica Canyon, departing from Umoljani and ending at Lukomir, known to be the last all-year-through inhabited semi-nomadic settlement at this altitude in the Balkans. There is quite a number of well equipped mountain huts to be found within this mountain group. Stanari P.D. (1,540 m.) is an excellent base for hikes in the central-western part of the mountain range. There are other mountain huts at Sitnik, Umoljani and Lukomir that might require prior reservation.

<doc id="751302" wikidata="Q1110607" url="?curid=751302" title="Igman">
<text>Igman (, ) is a mountain plateau in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. Geologically, Igman is part of the Dinaric Alps and formed largely of secondary and tertiary sedimentary rock, mostly Limestone. It is located southwest of Sarajevo, bordering the Bjelašnica range in the south and west, Hadžići and Ilidža in the north, and the river Željeznica in the east. Igman&#x27;s highest point, Crni vrh, west of the Malo Polje road, at an altitude of , the homonym highest elevation on the east side of this road reaches an elevation of . Most of Igman is covered with mixed forest with local pastures (f.i.: Veliko Polje: Large Field, Malo Polje: Small Field). Igman was the location of the lowest recorded temperature in the region, . Igman was the site of extensive combat during the 1992-95 Siege of Sarajevo and certain areas, in particular the surroundings of former front lines, constitute a high mine risk.

== Sports ==
During the 1984 Winter Olympics, Igman was, along with Jahorina and Bjelašnica, the location of the competition in the alpine and Nordic sports disciplines. Igman hosted primarily the Nordic disciplines; the Igman Olympic Jumps in the Malo Polje area were the site of the ski jumping events and also the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined events. Meanwhile, the Veliko Polje hosted the biathlon, cross-country skiing, and the cross-country skiing part of the Nordic combined event. In preparation of the Games a road was constructed across the Igman plateau connecting Sarajevo through Hadžići to the Malo Polje, Veliko Polje and Babin Dol venues. There were numerous structures constructed on Igman at this time, although many stand destroyed or bear the scars of the 1992-1995 conflict. One of the most eye catching structures remains the Ski Jumping platform at Malo Polje.

== Recent military history ==

===World War II===
Although the Igman area may probably have been the scene of military controversy in the earlier history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the most striking events took place in the course of the 20th century. The area became of substantial military significance during the struggle between Tito&#x27;s Partisans and the German occupational forces during the Second World War. A renowned episode of this struggle took place on Igman during Operation Südost Kroatien associated with what is known as the Second Enemy Offensive in January 1942. The Partisan 1st Proletarian Brigade, pursued by the German 342. Infanterie-Division, crossed Igman in what is known as the &quot;Igman March&quot;. With temperatures reaching , 172 Partisans suffered severe hypothermic injury, 6 of whom died.[12] When they approached the German–Italian demarcation line south of Sarajevo, the Partisans were able to infiltrate through the weak Italian cordon. A monument in memory of the Partisan struggle in this area is to be found on Veliko Polje.

===Bosnian War===
Mount Igman was usurped in the course of the Bosnian War, and suddenly became an area of major strategic importance as part of the Siege of Sarajevo. The predominantly Bosniak villages of Hrasnica and Butmir held out as an ARBiH stronghold between the VRS-held villages of Ilidža and Vojkovići, forming a corridor connecting the slopes of Mt Igman with the UN-controlled airport of Sarajevo.

After the completion of the Sarajevo Tunnel under the airport in July 1993, the small unpaved forest road passing over Mt Igman became the sole important supply road into the besieged city. The ARBiH-controlled central plateau of Igman came under increased VRS pressure when the suspicion became stronger that the area had become a major logistical artery of the besieged city. A major VRS offensive started July 1993 and on August 4, 1993 Serb forces captured part of the Igman supply road. The VRS advance was stopped under threat of NATO airstrikes. 

The area was declared a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) by the UN after the VRS retreated and UNPROFOR units were stationed on Igman and nearby Bjelašnica. The supply road into Sarajevo was agreed to be used for humanitarian goods only, but ARBiH logistical activity on the road and through the tunnel continued nevertheless. Discussion about real or alleged reluctance to withdraw ARBiH forces from the DMZ was a growing issue between UNPROFOR Commander General Rose and ARBiH Commander General Delić, with VRS Commander Mladić waiting for an opportunity to close the gap. Trucks on the Igman supply road&#x27;s narrow last stretch descending the steep north-eastern slope became fully exposed to fire from VRS artillery positions in Ilidža and Vojkovici. 

Meanwhile, the ARBiH units remaining on the plateau were formally restricted to R&amp;R activities, notably resulting in the building of the Igman Džamija, a wooden mosque in the forest, still much frequented today. The Igman supply road remained the almost exclusive supply route into Sarajevo until the end of the war. It was also the only entry and exit road for the Bosnian political leadership. Bosnian president Alija Izetbegović and foreign secretary Muhamed Sacirbey traveled through this road. 

Foreign negotiators tended to avoid the road as it was &quot;often described as the most dangerous road in Europe&quot;. Forced by a Serb blockade of the Sarajevo Airport, on August 19, 1995, a US Peace Mission headed by Richard Holbrooke took this road in order to reach Sarajevo for a meeting with the Bosnian presidency. Holbrooke decided to sit with General Wesley Clark in a Humvee, while the other members of the delegation travelled in a French UNPROFOR Renault VAB Armored Personnel Carrier. At a particular exposed and narrow point -- now marked by a French memorial plaque -- the French APC went over the edge and rolled and tumbled down some 400 metres. US Diplomats Robert Frasure, Nelson Drew and Joe Kruzel as well as the French Corporal-driver perished in the incident. The battered APC is still to be seen where it ultimately came to a halt - next to a memorial site for the victims. 

By mid-1995 the military situation became very tense again, and in August 1995 the VRS launched another offensive forcing UNPROFOR from the Bjelašnica ridge and advancing again towards Veliko Polje. After the second Markale shelling, on August, 30 NATO started Operation Deliberate Force, in which NATO aircraft engaged VRS Command &amp; Control facilities and other targets. In conjunction with these attacks a Rapid Reaction Force consisting of units of the British 19th Reg. Royal Artillery, the French 2nd Legion Etranger d&#x27;Infanterie and the Dutch 1e Mortiercompagnie of the NL Marine Corps, was deployed on Igman with (RNLA) search radars and heavy artillery, engaging any actively firing VRS artillery installation around Sarajevo until 14 September 1995, when the NATO air strikes were suspended to allow the implementation of the withdrawal of VRS heavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone, effectively ending the Siege of Sarajevo. A number of memorials and war cemetery sites is found throughout the Igman plateau.

==Skiing and hiking==
Igman is nowadays a popular destination for mountain-biking, hiking and skiing. Skiers will find -apart from 2 baby lifts- a single major skilift at Malo Polje that will bring them to with a single descent piste of red/bleu with a black split-off of . Mountain bikers will find a vast network of forest roads on Igman. The steep north-eastern slope of Igman is especially popular with the mountain bikers, who use the former wartime supply road to climb from Hrasnica up to an altitude of , and then descend with some bravura via a hiking trail. This hiking trail connects the village with the main mountain hut in the area: Hrasnički Stan. Another trail leads from Hrasnica to the Memorial for the deceased American diplomats and the memorial plaque for the French military fallen on this road and ends also at Hrasnički Stan. From there other trails lead to the mountain hut at Malo Polje proceeding further east towards the Javornik mountain hut.

==Other==
At the very foot of the mountain, close to Ilidža, are the sources of the river Bosna: Vrelo Bosne. This beautiful area is one of the most popular recreational areas of Sarajevo, and one its most important drinking water sources. Nearby lies one of the famous residential villas of Marshal Tito: Stojcevac, now fully destroyed. The area further up above Vrelo Bosne is the location of the former frontline and inaccessible because of heavy contamination with land mines and UXO. Demining activities on former frontlines have taken place and are still taking place around recreational areas and the main roads.

One of the primeval forests of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ravna Vala is also located on mountain Igman.

==Igman Initiative==
The Igman mountain, with its wartime legacy, has lend its name to a non-governmental/political initiative that is aimed at bringing the former belligerents in the region together. The mission of the Igman Initiative is to encourage normalization of the overall relations among the countries of the Dayton Quadrangles. The initiative was named after Mt. Igman in remembrance of the intellectual activists, who traveled from all over former Yugoslavia via the Igman Mountain Road to Sarajevo in April 1995 in solidarity with the besieged population. In November 2000, in Zagreb, a conference, “Prospects of Relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the FRY” was convened. The conference gathered more than a hundred NGOs from the nations ratifying the Dayton Agreement. The participating organizations agreed to formally join their efforts to stimulate the normalization of relations among the three countries. At the second session of the conference, held in Novi Sad, 2001, the Igman Initiative was established and a Council was appointed. The new institution would speed up the process of normalizing the relations. The Igman Initiative is now governed by four co-Presidents from Croatia, BiH, Serbia and Montenegro and its Council is currently composed of twenty members, five per country. The Igman Initiative efforts are essentially still aimed at establishing good neighbourly relations, building mutual trust and tolerance and overcoming all types of discrimination in the countries of the region.

<doc id="751303" wikidata="Q676769" url="?curid=751303" title="Sir Henry Merrivale">
<text>Sir Henry Merrivale is a fictional amateur detective created by &quot;Carter Dickson&quot;, a pen name of John Dickson Carr (1906–1977). Also known as &quot;the Old Man,&quot; by his initials &quot;H. M.&quot; (a pun on &quot;His Majesty&quot;), or &quot;the Maestro&quot;, Merrivale appears in 22 of Carr&#x27;s locked-room mysteries and &quot;impossible crime&quot; novels of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, as well as in two short stories.

==Character==
Merrivale is a fairly serious character in the early novels but is more of a comic figure in the later books, sometimes bordering on the grotesque. Much of the humor surrounding the character derives from his outbursts of temper and his absurdly colourful language.

When first introduced as a character, he is described as an older man nearing retirement. In later works, he talks explicitly about his age. In the 1940 novel &quot;And So to Murder&quot;, set in late 1939, Merrivale refers to himself as being almost 70. In the 1941 novel &quot;Seeing is Believing&quot;, while dictating his memoirs, he even gives his date of birth, February 6, 1871, which is consistent with his earlier comment. But his age becomes more ambiguous in subsequent novels. In the final books in the series, when he theoretically would be in his 80s, there&#x27;s no indication that he has been slowed by the years.

He is a baronet and a barrister – in &quot;The Judas Window&quot; he actually appears for the defence in court in a murder case – and he holds a medical degree. He has a number of other talents, including stage magic, disguise and a vast knowledge of the history of crime.

Merrivale occasionally mentions his family — a wife, two daughters and (late in the series) two sons-in-law. With his characteristically comic gruffness, he is inclined to complain about the trouble these relations give him, but none of them appear in any of the books or stories.

Due to the nebulous government position he holds and his eccentric personality, he is thought to have been partially based on Winston Churchill.

<text>Jahorina (, ) is a mountain in Bosnia and Herzegovina, located at the tripoint of the municipalities of Pale, Trnovo, Republika Srpska and Trnovo, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Part of the Dinaric Alps, it borders Mount Trebević. Its highest peak Ogorjelica has a summit elevation of , making it the second-highest of Sarajevo&#x27;s mountains, after Bjelašnica at .

The Jahorina ski resort located on the mountain hosted the women&#x27;s alpine skiing events of the 1984 Winter Olympics.

== History ==

=== Bosnian War ===
During the Bosnian War, the Republika Srpska used Jahorina as a military base during their 3-year long siege of Sarajevo. The Special Police Brigade established a &quot;special police training centre&quot; on the area&#x27;s grounds. Many of the Jahorina Centre&#x27;s officers were later arrested for their involvement in the Srebrenica massacre, especially during one of the massacre&#x27;s last phases, the Kravica massacre.

=== 21st century ===
In 2021, Bosnian Serb political leader, Milorad Dodik, was reported to have carried out &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; drills in the area on behalf of the Republika Srpska, sparking controversy. Critics accused Dodik of threatening Bosnia&#x27;s stability, while his supporters argued it was legal. The operation occurred during a political crisis in Bosnia, leading to Dodik responding that the blueprint for the drills had begun years earlier, claiming it had nothing to do with Bosnia&#x27;s political tensions.

==Ski resort==
The Jahorina ski resort is situated on the slopes of Jahorina. It is the largest and the most popular ski resort in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a destination for alpine skiing, snowboarding, hiking, and sledding.
==Landmine risk==
Jahorina was an area of major strategic importance during the Bosnian war. Some areas of the mountain, including areas near the resort, still contain land mines. However, most of the minefields are located at the southern side of the mountain, while the resort is on the north side. Extensive de-mining activities have taken place after the war. Skiing in borders of Jahorina ski resort is safe from mines and out-of-bounds areas are marked by skull-and-crossbones signs. Some off-course slopes were mined during the war and many remain risky. On October 30, 2011, a Slovenian paraglider was critically injured on Mount Jahorina when he landed in a minefield by mistake.

<text>Trebević () is a mountain in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, located in the territories of Republika Srpska, Sarajevo and East Sarajevo city, bordering Jahorina mountain. Trebević is tall, making it the second shortest of the Sarajevo mountains.

During the Middle Ages, Trebević was known as &quot;Zlatni Do&quot;. During the 1984 Winter Olympics Trebević, like the other Sarajevo mountains, was used for several Olympic events, such as bobsledding.

Trebević today is important as a tourist destination for citizens of Sarajevo as Igman or Bjelašnica. Most of the land mines are now cleared from heavy fighting that took place in the early 1990s. There are a few hotels, mountaineering homes, and other such structures on Trebević and the immediate area. The mountain is very popular for family picnics, hiking, climbing, mountain biking and it has a downhill track for local and international skiing competitions.

Trebević has been the main excursion site for Sarajevo citizens due to the favorable geographical position, climate and the beauty of the nature. The biological diversity is among the highest and it is extraordinary to find such a phenomenon near the heart of the big city. On 9 April 2014, Sarajevo Canton Assembly declared Trebević a protected area, in order to conserve and improve each element of the geographical and biological diversity.

Trebević can be reached from Sarajevo by the Trebević Cable Car, which starts from the neighbourhood of Bistrik.

==Mineral and crystal deposits==

The area is known to contain quartz, siderite, and calcite crystal deposits, and one such item is on display in Sarajevo at the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===Orthodox cross controversy===
In March 2008, a Bosnian Serb organization Savez logoraša Republike Srpske (&quot;Association of Bosnian Serb War Prisoners&quot;), led by Branislav Dukić, announced its intention to erect a giant high Orthodox Christian cross at the part of the mountain on Republika Srpska territory in order to commemorate the Serb victims in Sarajevo during the Bosnian War. The idea followed a move by Bosnian Croats who erected a Catholic Christian cross on Hum Hill above Mostar, remembering Croats killed there during the Bosnian War. High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina Miroslav Lajčák asked Republika Srpska authorities not to allow the construction of the cross.

The structure was built in early 2014, only for it to be demolished within a month by persons unknown. There has recently been talk about its reconstruction; however, this has yet to materialise due to the fear of it being demolished once again.

<doc id="751306" wikidata="Q1508343" url="?curid=751306" title="Treskavica">
<text>Treskavica () is a mountain range in Bosnia and Herzegovina, situated in Trnovo municipality just south of city of Sarajevo. Mala Ćaba (Đokin Toranj) peak at 2088 m (6850 ft.), which makes Treskavica the tallest of all the mountains circling Sarajevo, and only some 300 m shorter than the tallest mountain in the country. On clear days with good weather, climbers can see far into the distance, up to Montenegro and the Adriatic Sea.

==Topography==

Geologically, the Treskavica range is part of the Dinaric Alps and formed largely of secondary and tertiary sedimentary rock, mostly limestone and dolomite. A number of beautiful mountain lakes are scattered throughout the group, of which Veliko Jezero is the largest. A number of streams source from these mountains: the Bistrica tributary of the Drina river, the Željeznica tributary of the Bosna river, Ljuta and Rakitnica tributaries of the Neretva. Notable peaks are Mala Ćaba (2088 m.), Pašina Planina (2070 m.), Mali Treskač (1950 m.) and Lupoč (1773 m.).

==History==

During the Bosnian War, the Treskavica mountains were part of the frontline between both ARBiH and VRS, which saw intense combat. Numerous battles were fought within these mountains over the possession of the small town of Trnovo, which would allow access to the Goražde enclave and the staging point for the Siege of Sarajevo.

Nowadays, the borderline between the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina runs parallel to the former lines diagonally through Treskavica, dividing the south-eastern part of the mountain range towards the territory of the Republika Srpska whereas the north-western part belongs to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

Although contamination with land mines and unexploded ordnance still pose a serious threat throughout the area, hiking and tourism have picked up during the last couple of years, and some mountain huts have re-opened (Sustavac, and Turnovi Stan). 

The main peak of Mala Ćaba is generally known as Đokin Toranj because of a view tower that used to stand on its summit, but has been destroyed and removed during the war. A marked itinerary, leading from Veliko Jezero to the top was re-established in 2010.

<doc id="751310" wikidata="Q133556" url="?curid=751310" title="Ashley Cole">
<text>Ashley Cole (born 20 December 1980) is an English football coach and former player. As a player, he played as a left-back, most notably for Arsenal and Chelsea. Cole is considered by many critics and fellow professional players as one of the best defenders of his generation, one of the greatest English players of all time as well as one of the greatest left-backs in the history of the sport. Born in Stepney, London, Cole began his youth career at Arsenal and made his full debut for the club in November 1999, going on to make 228 appearances and scoring nine goals for the North London club. With Arsenal he won two Premier League titles, three FA Cups, and was an integral member of the &quot;Invincibles&quot; team of the 2003–04 season, who went the entire league season undefeated. Cole also made an appearance in Arsenal&#x27;s first UEFA Champions League final in 2006; the club lost 2–1 to Barcelona.

In August 2006, after a protracted transfer saga, Cole completed a move to rival club Chelsea, with whom he won further honours, including the Premier League in the 2009–10 season, four FA Cups, one Football League Cup and one UEFA Champions League. He was released by Chelsea at the end of the 2013–14 season. With seven winners&#x27; medals, Cole has won the FA Cup more times than any other player in history, and is one of two players to have won the Double with two clubs, along with Nicolas Anelka.

Cole was an England international from 2001 to 2014, playing at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups, as well as Euro 2004 and Euro 2012. He was voted England Player of the Year in 2010. When he retired from international football in 2014, he had won 107 caps, making him England&#x27;s most-capped full-back.

==Early life==
Cole&#x27;s father, Ron Callender, is from Barbados. He left the family after seven years of marriage and later moved to Australia. Cole and his younger brother Matthew were brought up by their mother Sue Cole, going to Bow School in Tower Hamlets.

==Club career==

===Arsenal: 1999–2006===
Cole started his career by joining his local club, Arsenal, whom he had supported as a child. At the age of 18, on 30 November 1999, he made his first-team debut in the League Cup fourth round against Middlesbrough; Arsenal lost 1–3 on penalties after the match ended 2–2 at the end of extra time at the Riverside Stadium. On 25 February 2000, he signed his first professional contract. His Premier League debut came on 14 May 2000 against Newcastle United, as part of an experimental side that lost 4–2 away on the final day of the season. Before he fully broke into the Arsenal side, he spent part of the 1999–2000 season on loan at Crystal Palace, where he played 14 league matches and scored one goal, a long-range half-volley against Blackburn Rovers. When Sylvinho, Arsenal&#x27;s established left-back, suffered an injury in the autumn of the 2000–01 season, Cole took the opportunity to establish himself in the first team and remained first-choice even after the Brazilian&#x27;s recovery.

With Arsenal, he won the FA Premier League twice (in 2002 and 2004), and the FA Cup three times (in 2002, 2003 and 2005, scoring in the penalty shootout in the final of the latter). Although injured for much of the 2005–06 season, he recovered in time to play in Arsenal&#x27;s UEFA Champions League final defeat to Barcelona at the end of the season. In total he made 228 first-team appearances for the &quot;Gunners&quot;, scoring nine goals.

Cole had a very good season in 2004–05. He was a regular at left-back for both England and Arsenal despite Gaël Clichy&#x27;s claim for a place in the first-team squad. Cole scored his first goal of the season in the seventh game in a tough trip to Manchester City in which he scored the opening and only goal to give Arsenal an important win. He scored his second goal in a 3–1 away win to Aston Villa, scoring Arsenal&#x27;s third in only the 28th minute.

===Transfer saga: 2005–2006===
Cole was found guilty of making contact with league rivals Chelsea over a possible move, without informing Arsenal. He was fined £100,000 by the Premier League on 2 June 2005 for a tapping-up meeting at a hotel in January 2005. Cole, his agent Jonathan Barnett, the Chelsea manager José Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon, and agent Pini Zahavi were present at the meeting. An appeal in August 2005 did not reject the guilty verdict, but his fine was reduced to £75,000. Chelsea were also fined £300,000 and Mourinho was fined £200,000, reduced on appeal in August 2005 to £75,000. Barnett&#x27;s licence was suspended for 18 months and he was also fined £100,000.

On 18 July 2005, Cole signed a one-year extension to his contract with Arsenal, but just a year later departed from the club in acrimonious circumstances. On 15 July 2006, Cole launched a verbal attack on Arsenal; in his autobiography, he claimed that the Arsenal board had treated him as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; and that they had &quot;fed him to the sharks&quot; over the tapping-up affair while Arsenal, from their part, insisted that they were legally obliged to punish Cole for his illegal contact with Chelsea. Cole was deliberately left out of Arsenal&#x27;s 2006–07 team photograph, fuelling press speculation that he would leave.

On 28 July 2006, Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein confirmed that Arsenal and Chelsea had been in &quot;civil talks&quot; about the player. Chelsea insisted they would not raise their £16 million bid for Cole, but Arsenal held out for at a higher valuation of £25 million. Negotiations continued throughout August and looked to be heading for deadlock, but eventually Cole signed for Chelsea on 31 August for a fee of £5 million, with William Gallas being transferred from Chelsea to Arsenal as part of the same deal. The deal was closed after the transfer window had officially ended, and was not confirmed until an hour and a half after the deadline had passed. The move angered Arsenal fans, who dubbed him &quot;Cashley&quot; and waved fake £20 notes with Cole&#x27;s face on them at him when the two clubs faced each other on 10 December 2006.

Arsenal had offered Cole a longer contract to stay at the club, but he had been left &quot;trembling with anger&quot; when they offered him wages of £55,000 per week. His wage increased to £120,000 a week when he signed a new contract in September 2009.

===Chelsea: 2006–2014===
Cole was given the number 3 shirt at Chelsea, and made his first appearance for the club as a substitute for Wayne Bridge in their 2–1 win over Charlton Athletic on 9 September. He issued a public statement concerning his transfer saying he &quot;forgave&quot; Arsenal for how he felt he was treated during his time there.

On 31 January 2007, Cole suffered a serious knee injury in the 3–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers in a Premier League game at Stamford Bridge, although after a scan it was revealed to be not as bad as first thought, with Chelsea optimistic that he would return before the end of the 2006–07 season. Cole did indeed make a return at the end of the season, playing in the last twelve minutes of the 2007 FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium against Manchester United. Chelsea emerged victorious 1–0 after extra-time with a goal scored by Didier Drogba, to win the 2007 FA Cup.
Cole was reportedly one of the players upset when José Mourinho was relieved of his position as Chelsea manager. He was dropped in favour of Wayne Bridge for the 2008 Football League Cup final, which Chelsea lost 2–1 to Tottenham Hotspur. However, Cole scored his first Chelsea goal in Chelsea&#x27;s very next game, on 1 March 2008, the fourth goal in a 4–0 away victory against West Ham United. On 19 March 2008, Cole was involved in a controversial incident in a Premier League game against Tottenham at White Hart Lane where he performed a high tackle on Tottenham&#x27;s Alan Hutton. Referee Mike Riley gave Cole a yellow card, a decision which was judged as too lenient by some analysts. Cole allegedly also &quot;turned his back on the referee&quot; and the episode renewed debate in the media over the game&#x27;s rules on dissent towards officials.

After starting Chelsea&#x27;s first six games in the league, Cole scored his third, fourth and fifth Chelsea goals at home to Burnley, Tottenham Hotspur and Sunderland respectively. On 2 September 2009, he signed a new four-year deal which will contract him to Chelsea until 2013.
On 10 February 2010, he suffered a fractured left ankle in the 2–1 defeat against Everton that kept him out of action for three months. He eventually made his return against Stoke City, a game which Chelsea won 7–0. Cole scored a goal against Wigan Athletic on the last day of the Premier League in an 8–0 win as Chelsea claimed the title. He then played in the 2010 FA Cup final, where Chelsea beat Portsmouth to give Cole the second league and cup double of his career. He started all 38 league games for Chelsea in the 2010–11 season, and was awarded the Chelsea F.C. Player&#x27;s Player of the Year award for the second time.
In the 2011–12 season, Cole won the seventh FA Cup of his career after Chelsea beat Liverpool 2–1 in the 2012 FA Cup final. In the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, Cole was pivotal in Chelsea&#x27;s 1–0 victory which included a goal-line clearance that denied &quot;Barça&quot; an away goal. Cole also received praise for his role in the final against Bayern Munich on 19 May 2012, both for his defending and for scoring in the decisive penalty shoot-out as Chelsea won their first European title.

Cole scored his first goal for over two years against Stoke City on 22 September 2012, proving to be the winner. On 1 December 2012, Cole made his 350th Premier League appearance, in a 3–1 away loss to West Ham United.

On 22 January 2013, Cole signed a one-year extension to his contract with Chelsea. Cole again helped the club win a European title during the 2012–13 season, playing in a 2–1 victory over Benfica in the 2013 UEFA Europa League final on 15 May.

During the 2013–14 season, Cole was dropped from the Chelsea team, with César Azpilicueta replacing him as the club&#x27;s first-choice left-back in the month of November. Cole captained the team on the last match day against Cardiff City in a 2–1 away win which turned out to be his last in a Chelsea shirt. On 23 May 2014, after the end of the season, he was included on the list of players released by Chelsea. Cole&#x27;s contract expired on 30 June 2014.

===Roma===

On 7 July 2014, Cole signed a two-year deal with Roma. He made his competitive debut on 30 August in their first game of the Serie A season, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–0 win over Fiorentina at the Stadio Olimpico. On 19 January 2016, Cole terminated his contract with Roma with one year of his contract remaining.

===LA Galaxy===
Cole signed with LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer on 27 January 2016. On 24 February, he made his debut in a goalless home draw against Santos Laguna in the CONCACAF Champions League; on 6 March, he made his league debut in the first game of the 2016 season, playing the full 90 minutes of a 4–1 win over D.C. United at the StubHub Center. Manager Bruce Arena praised Cole and fellow veteran new signing Nigel de Jong after the result. On 1 May, he was sent off for a second booking in a 1–1 draw at Sporting Kansas City. Cole was ejected following a clumsy tackle on Benny Feilhaber after being cautioned just 32 seconds earlier. He received his second dismissal of the season on 25 June in the match against San Jose Earthquakes. Cole had been booked for a reckless tackle and as emotions were high, a melee ensued. The referee deemed Cole&#x27;s reaction worthy of another booking and as a result he received his marching orders for the second time in eight league games.
On 7 August 2016, Cole scored his first goal for the Galaxy, a last-minute equaliser in a 2–2 home draw against the New York Red Bulls. His team qualified for the 2016 MLS Cup Playoffs, where they lost the Western Conference semi-finals to the Colorado Rapids on penalties. Cole&#x27;s attempt was saved by Colorado goalkeeper Tim Howard, and after the game he apologised publicly to his long-time England teammate Steven Gerrard, who was playing his final professional match for the Galaxy that night.

In his second season in California, Cole saw another red card on 23 August 2017 after 18 minutes of a 2–0 loss at Columbus Crew SC for a foul on Pedro Santos. He played 29 matches for the Galaxy, scoring once in a 6–2 home loss to Real Salt Lake, as the team came dead last and missed out on the play-offs for the first time since 2008.

Head coach Sigi Schmid named Cole as captain ahead of the 2018 season. The Galaxy missed the play-offs again. He was released by LA Galaxy at the end of their 2018 season.

===Derby County===
On 21 January 2019, Cole joined Championship side Derby County, reuniting with manager Frank Lampard who was his teammate at Chelsea and with England. He signed a contract until the end of the 2018–19 season. He was released at the end of the season. On 18 August 2019, Cole officially announced his retirement.

==Coaching career==
Cole became a coach at Derby after retiring from playing, and later followed Frank Lampard to Chelsea where he was an academy coach.

On 27 July 2021, Cole was named as assistant coach of the England U21s alongside head coach Lee Carsley, combining his duties with his role at Chelsea&#x27;s academy.

On 3 February 2022, Cole joined Everton as a first-team coach, again joining up with Frank Lampard who had recently been appointed as manager.

On 23 January 2023, Cole left Everton as a result of Frank Lampard leaving the club.

When Wayne Rooney was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Birmingham City in October 2023, Cole joined his staff as a first-team coach. He departed the club in September 2024.

On 23 August 2024, it was confirmed that Cole would assist Carsley in his role as interim head coach of the England senior team following the departure of Gareth Southgate.

On 14 September 2024, it was confirmed that Cole had left Birmingham City to join The FA on a full-time basis.

==International career==

Cole has played for England at youth and senior levels. He was capped for the England U-20 team at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside Stuart Taylor, Peter Crouch, Andrew Johnson and Matthew Etherington. However, the team finished bottom of their group, suffering three defeats without scoring any goals. He also made four appearances for England under-21s, scoring once.

After just four appearances for the Under-21s, Cole was fast-tracked into the England senior team and Sven-Göran Eriksson handed Cole his senior international debut against Albania, on 28 March 2001. He played for England at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, UEFA Euro 2004 (where he was named as one of four England players in the all-star squad for the tournament) and UEFA Euro 2012.

Cole was also an ever-present for England in the 2006 World Cup; in their second round match against Ecuador he made a crucial block, deflecting Carlos Tenorio&#x27;s shot onto the crossbar. The match ended with England winning 1–0, but the team were knocked out on penalties by Portugal in the quarter-finals. By the end of 2008, Cole had achieved 68 caps for England, all of which were starting appearances.

He made his 79th appearance for England on 12 June 2010 in the 1–1 draw against the United States in the 2010 World Cup Group stage match. He beat the record of 79 caps by a black English international (John Barnes, who appeared for England from 1983 to 1995) when he played against Algeria later that month. He has played more internationals without scoring than any other outfield player in England history. He won his 86th cap against Montenegro in October 2010, and alongside Kenny Sansom, Cole is now England&#x27;s most-capped full-back in history, an achievement which helped him pick up the England Player of the Year award for 2010, as voted for by fans. On 6 February 2013, he earned his 100th cap as England beat Brazil 2–1 at Wembley.

On 11 May 2014, he announced his retirement from international football after being omitted from the England squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

==Style of play==
Cole&#x27;s game incorporates an attacking approach to his play, which supports his teams&#x27; forward play. As a youth, he &quot;always liked scoring goals and attacking&quot;, but grew to love the role of defending, as being a left-back was the only opportunity of breaking into the seniors. Prior to his inclusion in the Arsenal first team, Cole studied the conduct of fellow defender Nigel Winterburn to improve his play; Winterburn concurrently offered pointers to improve his positioning. He modelled his game on Brazilian Roberto Carlos: &quot;He&#x27;s got natural talent, but I think if you train hard enough you can be nearly as good as that.&quot;

Liam Brady described Cole as a player with &quot;great character and determination&quot; and his former teammate Sylvinho noted that one of Cole&#x27;s qualities was being competent: &quot;Ashley does not need people saying, &#x27;Do this&#x27; or &#x27;Go there&#x27;. He knows, he knows.&quot; The rapid progress made by Cole in his debut season for Arsenal &quot;surprised&quot; Wenger and prompted him to make the defender his first pick. Sylvinho, the player displaced, commented that Wenger&#x27;s belief in Cole helped him to develop as a player: &quot;He spoke to [Cole] and said: &#x27;After Silvinho you can play left-back. You are one of the best left-backs at the club and one day will be one of the best in the world.&#x27;&quot; Cole&#x27;s link-up play with winger Robert Pires and main striker Thierry Henry in a 4–4–2 formation effectively made him &quot;a wing-back or winger playing in a back four&quot; because Arsenal&#x27;s game emphasised attacking football.

Under José Mourinho at Chelsea, Cole&#x27;s attacking threat was restrained, meaning it allowed the player to focus more on defending and marking. This was a &quot;side of his game&quot; Cole improved the most according to Winterburn, given he was criticised in the past for being caught out of position. The arrival of Luiz Felipe Scolari however ensured Cole made forward runs in the opposition&#x27;s half; Aston Villa manager Martin O&#x27;Neill believed the liberation of Cole was a sign that he was &quot;back playing to his very best&quot;.

Cole is renowned for making timed goal-line clearances and &quot;cutting out danger&quot;. In a league match against Tottenham Hotspur in December 2002, he made two notable clearances, which demonstrated to him that his defensive game had improved. He also made two goal line clearances in Chelsea&#x27;s 2011–12 Champions League winning campaign. The first was against Napoli, in a 3–1 round-of-16 first leg defeat, and the second in Chelsea&#x27;s semi-final first leg 1–0 win against Barcelona. Both were vital as Chelsea went on to win the ties with a margin of one goal on aggregate, eventually lifting the Champions League. Cole is said to have a &quot;mean streak&quot;, and has been labelled a &quot;dirty player&quot;, something which he himself and his former coaches have strongly denied.

==Personal life==
Cole began a relationship with Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Tweedy in September 2004, when they were living in the same block of flats in London; they married on 15 July 2006 in Wrotham Park, Hertfordshire. In January 2008, the couple almost separated after allegations were made that Cole had affairs with three other women. He, however, disputed the allegations and the couple stayed together. It was announced on 23 February 2010 that the couple would separate following new allegations of adultery. Three months later, it was announced that Cheryl was filing for divorce. They officially divorced on 3 September 2010. Cole has a son (born 2016) and a daughter (born 2018) with the Italian model Sharon Canu.

In 2006, Cole sued the &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; newspapers for libel after they printed allegations that he was involved in a &quot;homosexual orgy&quot;. Both papers retracted the allegations. The same year, Cole released an autobiography titled &quot;My Defence&quot;, which sold 4,000 copies in the first six weeks of release. Cole&#x27;s former teammate, Jens Lehmann, criticised Cole for writing an autobiography when he was 25.

Cole has had a couple of minor brushes with the police. On 4 March 2009 he was held after swearing in front of a police officer outside a South Kensington nightclub. He was taken to a police station and issued with an £80 fixed penalty notice before being released. On 4 January 2010, Cole was convicted of a speeding offence committed on 17 November 2009. He was recorded exceeding the speed limit by doing 104 mph in a 50 mph zone on the A3 road in Kingston upon Thames, a residential stretch. His defence at Kingston Magistrates&#x27; Court, opposing the charge in his absence, argued unsuccessfully that the police speed gun was faulty. Cole also claimed that his actions were excusable because he was trying to evade the paparazzi. On 29 January he was fined £1000 and disqualified from driving for four months.

On 27 February 2011, Cole accidentally shot Tom Cowan, a 21-year-old sports science student on work experience at Chelsea, with a .22 calibre air rifle from only five feet away at the club&#x27;s Cobham Training Centre, apparently unaware that the rifle was loaded. Cole formally apologised to Cowan, and discussed the incident with Chelsea officials.

<text>Isa-beg Ishaković (; 1439–70) was an Ottoman Bosnian general and the governor of the Sanjak of Bosnia for most of his career. Of Bosnian noble origin, he was recruited after being held hostage by the Ottomans. He was a provincial governor during the 1450s and 1460s, first in charge of the Sanjak of Skopje, and then the Sanjak of Bosnia. He was instrumental in the Ottoman conquests in the region, and was one of the Sultan&#x27;s most trusted generals.

==Origin==
There are two main theories about his father identity:
*Ishak Hranić Kosača, the brother of Bosnian nobleman Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, who was sent to the sultan Mehmed II as hostage and guarantee of Kosača&#x27;s loyalty. After being adopted by Pasha Jigit Bey he was converted into Islam and had by contemporary measures a significant military and political career within the Ottoman Empire. His patronymic Hranić indicates that his father&#x27;s name was Hrana, which means that he was not Stjepan&#x27;s brother but that Ishak Bey Hranić was Sandalj Hranić&#x27;s brother.
*Ishak Hranić/Hranušić, taken prisoner when the &quot;akinci&quot; intruded a holding of the Pavlović noble family (lords of eastern Bosnia, including the &quot;župa&quot; of Vrhbosna). He proved himself exceptionally able while a prisoner, so the &quot;akinci&quot; leader freed him (prompted him to leave the property, as well as his title).

==Biography==
Isa Beg Ishaković conquered Hodidjed fortress in 1435, after it had been briefly reconquered by Matko Talovac in 1434.

Isa-Beg Ishaković was appointed as &quot;sanjak-bey&quot; (provincial governor) of the Sanjak of Skopje in the spring of 1439, in place of his father, Ishak-Beg, who was sent to lead military actions in Serbia. He was then appointed the &quot;sanjak-bey&quot; of Bosnia, briefly in 1463, and then from 1464 to 1470.
As governor of the province of Bosnia, Isa-Beg assured its future prosperity. He founded Sarajevo in 1461 in the former Bosnian province of Vrhbosna. Between then and 1463 he built the core of the city&#x27;s Old Town district, including a mosque, a closed marketplace, a public bath, a hostel, and the Governor&#x27;s castle (&quot;Saray&quot;), which gave the city its present name. In much the same way and year he also founded Novi Pazar (in Serbia), rendered from , literally meaning &quot;new marketplace&quot;, some eleven kilometers from the medieval settlement of Trgovište (&quot;Trgovište&quot; means &quot;marketplace&quot;). There he built a mosque, a marketplace, a public bath, a hostel, and a compound. He is also responsible for establishing a number of other cities and towns in the region.

Ishaković built many important buildings part of the Old Bazaar in Skopje, like the Čifte Hammam, Kapan Han, Ishak Bey Mosque (dedicated to his father Ishak-Beg, also known as Isaklija or Aladža), the madrasa (Islamic school) and library (within Isak-Beg&#x27;s Mosque, one of the first Islamic libraries in Europe), and many other buildings that belonged to his endowment (&quot;waqf&quot;, ). 

Ishaković participated in ransom slavery in 1470 when he ransomed a highly positioned Ottoman official named Mustafa by releasing the wife of Croatian nobleman Ivan Marković and paying 500 ducats to Ragusan Frančesko Micalović, the agent in this transaction.

==Annotations==
*Name: He is referred to as Isa-Beg Ishaković in Bosnian sources. Some sources spell his patronymic &quot;Isaković&quot;. Based on his possible origins, he may be referred to as Isa-beg Ishaković Hranić or Isa-beg Ishaković Hranušić.

<text>Gazi Husrev Bey (, &quot;Gāzī Ḫusrev Beğ&quot;; Modern Turkish: &quot;Gazi Hüsrev Bey&quot;; 1484–1541) was an Ottoman Bosnian sanjak-bey (governor) of the Sanjak of Bosnia in 1521–1525, 1526–1534, and 1536–1541. He was known for his successful conquests and campaigns to further Ottoman expansion into Croatia and Hungary. However, his most important legacy was major contribution to the improvement of the structural development of Sarajevo and its urban area. He ordered and financed construction of many important buildings there, and with his will bequeathed all his wealth into endowment for the construction and long-term support of religious and educational facilities and institutions, such as the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque, and the Gazi Husrev-begova Medresa complex with a Gazi Husrev-beg Library, also known as &quot;Kuršumlija&quot;.

==Biography==
===Origin===
Gazi Husrev-beg was born in Serres, Greece. His father, Ferhad-beg, was a Bosnian nobleman from Hum (modern-day Herzegovina), who worked as a high court official. His mother, Selçuk Sultan, was the daughter of the Sultan Bayezid II, making Gazi Husrev-beg Beyazid II&#x27;s grandson.

===Career===
In less than three years, he conquered the fortresses of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica. He was appointed sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Bosnia on 15 September 1521, becoming one of Sultan Suleiman I&#x27;s most trusted men.

A relentless campaign of conquest followed soon; the fortified towns of Greben, Sokol, Jezero, Vinac, Vrbaški Grad, Livač, Kamatin, Bočac, Udbina, Vrana, Modruč, and Požega fell at his hands.

He founded, among the many buildings he ordered to construct in the city, the vakuf of Sarajevo, which was active until the 20th century.

Gazi Husrev-beg played a crucial role to overcome the Christian army at the Battle of Mohács. His 10,000 Akıncıs and his irregular cavalry, composed of Turks, Bosnians and Crimean Tatars, served as reserve soldiers in that battle. According to the Ottoman military strategy, the Akıncıs circled the European knights while the Turkish infantry made a counterfeit retreat after the first assault.

===Death===

Gazi Husrev-beg&#x27;s forces struggled against a power vacuum in Montenegro after the death of Ottoman ally, islamized Montenegrin lord Skender-beg Crnojević in 1528. In 1541, during an uprising of Montenegro nobility, he set out to protect the Crnojevićs and the local populace. After fighting many battles to maintain order in the region, although finally victorious, he was killed while fighting Christian rebels in Mokro, a small village in Drobnjaci (present-day Montenegro). Legend states that he was a big man, so his warriors were unable to carry him, but instead of doing this, they took apart his intestines and buried them on a small hill called &quot;Hodžina glavica&quot; (Imam&#x27;s Peak). The legend has it that this event gave Drobnjaci their name (&quot;Drob&quot; is an archaic Serbo-Croatian word for intestines), although the name Drobnjaci is recorded earlier in history. However, its real connection to Gazi Husrev-beg&#x27;s place of rest is unclear. His corpse was returned to Sarajevo, where it remains in a tomb in the courtyard of his mosque (türbe), next to the smaller one of Murat Bey Tardić, a former Christian prisoner converted to Islam and made his duke and deputy (ćehaja).

==Endowment== 
Gazi Husrev-beg&#x27;s endowment or Gazi Husrev-begov vakuf (trust or foundation) is based on his three &quot;vakufnama&quot;&#x27;s (deeds of endowment), the first being issued November 1531, second on January 1537, and the third on November 1537. The three deeds of endowment were also legal basis for the establishment of the institution, the &quot;Gazi Husrev-begov Vakuf&quot; (or &quot;Gazi Husrev-beg&#x27;s Endowment&quot;), whose primary purpose is to take care of the endowment&#x27;s properties and support for the endowed established institutions. With it Husrev-beg bequeathed his property and wealth for the construction of facilities and the establishment of institutions, religious, educational, and public. The first &quot;vakufnama&quot; from 1531 required the construction of a mosque, humanitarian public kitchen (&quot;imaret&quot;) and guest house (&quot;musafirhana&quot;) and &quot;ḫāniqāh&quot;. The second issued on 1537 required for the Kuršumlija madrasa to be established and built, and also library to be equipped with books and other publications books purchased. The third from 1537 endowed additional property to support the mosque and other facilities.

The endowment today consists of a number of buildings and institutions built and supported by the &quot;Gazi Husrev-begov Vakuf&quot;: the Gazi Husrev-bey&#x27;s Mosque, built in 1531 as the central object of the religious part of the endowment with a clock tower, Husrev-beg&#x27;s and his turbe&#x27;s and other supporting buildings, Gazi Husrev-bey&#x27;s Madrasa with the Gazi Husrev-bey&#x27;s Library as the central objects of the educational part of the endowment, Gazi Husrev-bey&#x27;s bezistan, Morića Han as konak and as a caravanserai, Gazi Husrev-bey&#x27;s Hamam, imaret and musafirhana near clock tower, , šadrvan, hastahana as a hospital, mekteb, Gazi Husrev-begov Hanikah as a Dervish&#x27;s monastery with a boarding school, and large number of shops around the Baščaršija.

The Museum of Gazi Husrev Beg is established in fall 2012 by the Gazi Husrev Beg Waqf (endowment).

Most of these building are declared National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Commission to preserve national monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<text>Energopetrol is a Bosnian oil company based in Sarajevo. It was founded in the 1960s as a part of the Energoinvest corporation. Its logo includes the orange letters &quot;EP&quot; in a serif font surrounded by an orange circle.

Due to large debt and general failure of management, the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as majority owner, privatized 67% of its stake within the company. The Croatian-Hungarian company INA-MOL had acquired the shares for 220 million Bosnian Marks (100 million dollars). The INA-MOL consortium had acquired 67 gas stations and two office buildings belonging to Energopetrol in Sarajevo. The consortium had promised to keep the present labor force, the name (Energopetrol), and turn the company into a regional giant. The government had decided to keep the former Energopetrol Terminals into a new state owned corporation Terminali FBiH. The government also decided to keep the Hotel Marsal within its control.

==Ownership structure==
Current shareholders are:
*INA-MOL - 67%
*Government of FBiH - 22%
*Small Shareholders - 11%

Since that period, Sarajevska Pivara had steady production growth, growing from 299,000 hectoliters in 1984 to 784,000 hectoliters in 1991. With these results, Sarajevska Pivara became one of the four leading companies in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<text>Hayat TV is a television station from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The word, &quot;&quot;, means &quot;life&quot; in Arabic.

It is a privately owned TV station, which started airing on 24 February 1992. Its coverage is over 1.5 million people in Bosnia, numerous cable subscribers in the neighbouring countries, and satellite viewers. In the beginning of 2009 Hayat TV opened its new headquarters in Vogošća, suburb of Sarajevo.

Hayat now consists of a &quot;Hayat&quot; channel for the Bosnia region and also a Hayat Plus channel for its diaspora. In early 2012 the channel opened two new music channels, Hayat Folk to cater for Bosnian folk music, and Hayat Music to cater for 50% English music, and 50% local pop music. Hayat Music became the first channel in Bosnia to be transmitted in widescreen, 16:9 ratio. In 2014, Hayat opened first Bosnian channel for kids named Hayatovci. Hayat&#x27;s logo bears resemblance to American TV network NBC&#x27;s distinct peacock logo.

Hayat, along with ATV, founded Program Plus, part of the joint program between the two television companies, in 2011.

All five of Hayat&#x27;s channels transmit in Europe through EutelSat16 satellite and various cable operators. The station also broadcasts all of its channels worldwide on various IPTV platforms - Hayat TV, Hayat Plus, Hayat Folk, Hayat Music and Hayatovci.

<text>The Oslobođenje (; ; &#x27;Liberation&#x27;) is the Bosnian national daily newspaper, published in Sarajevo. It is the oldest daily newspaper still in circulation in the Bosnia and Herzegovina. Founded on 30 August 1943, in the midst of World War II, on a patch of territory liberated by Partisans, in what was otherwise a German-occupied country, the paper gained recognition over the years for its high journalistic standards and is recipient of numerous domestic honors and international awards in a branch.

==History==


The &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; was founded on 30 August 1943 in Donja Trnova near Ugljevik, as an anti-Nazi newspaper. The first issue was printed on August 30, 1943 in Donja Trnova near Ugljevik as a newsletter of the National Liberation Front for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first editor was Rodoljub Čolaković. 

Apart from Rodoljub Čolaković, the main articles for the first issue were written by Avdo Humo and Hasan Brkić, also editors. The two were assisted by professional journalists Vilko Winterhalter and Milan Gavrić, and writers Skender Kulenović and Branko Ćopić. Meša Selimović was one of the founders of the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot;. In the first issue of the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot;, Selimović wrote an article about the Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union, according to information he heard on radio stations Moscow and Free Yugoslavia.

The first courier was Raif Dizdarević. He delivered the first issues of the &quot;Oslobođenja&quot; to Jajce, where the AVNOJ was already being prepared.

The second (September) issue was also printed in Donja Trnova, without markings of the place of publication and printing due to the danger of an enemy attack. During the World War II, the newspaper was also printed in Tuzla (the third, October issue), the village of Busije near Ribnik (the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh issues), in Međeđe Brdo near Sanica (from the eighth to the 12th issue) and in Jajce (from 13 to 29 issues). On April 12, 1945, the 30th issue of &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; was published, the last in the World War II, which was printed in Sarajevo, which has been the headquarters of this newspaper since then. 

In mid 1970s, while SR Bosnia and Herzegovina was a part of SFR Yugoslavia, the newspaper run a subsidiary office in Frankfurt in West Germany which published the edition targeted at numerous Yugoslav workers (&#x27;gastarbeiter&#x27;) and other citizens living in the country.

On August 30, 1973, Josip Broz Tito sent congratulations to newspaper on the occasion of its 30th anniversary. It was then established Day of the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; - August 30. 

The most prosperous time of the newspaper was 1984. The &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; was included bid for the 1984 Winter Olympics, its preparations and implementation. All the capacities of the company, which had around 2,500 employees in 1984, were put to use for this historic, not only sporting, event. In the days of 14 Winter Olympics, the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; achieved the largest circulation, and the entire system a great business success. In 1984, the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; with 21 editions achieved 126 million printed copies of newspapers, magazines, publications and books. It was the year of the highest production for the &quot;Oslobođenja&quot; printing house since the installation of a new rotation in 1980 in Sarajevo neighborhood of Nedžarići. 

During the Bosnian war and the Siege of Sarajevo, the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; staff operated out of a makeshift newsroom in a bomb shelter after its 10-story office building had been destroyed. The war left five staff members dead and 25 wounded. Kjašif Smajlović, the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; correspondent from Zvornik, was the first journalist victim of the Bosnian war.

On May 29, 1992, the &quot;Oslobođenja&quot; building was set on fire. The first, but not the last time. For months, the Army of Republika Srpska did not give up its intentions of disabling and obstructing the work of the newspaper. No one expected the release of a new issue the next morning. However, at 6 o&#x27;clock in the morning, a news story was published on the front page with a photo of the fire and the message: &quot;Oslobođenje ide dalje&quot; (The &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; goes further). Three months later, the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; building was set on fire for the second time. After this attack, the skyscraper&#x27;s eastern and western portions collapsed due to the fires weakening its support columns. 

On April 9, 1993, among many people from around the world, &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; was visited by the US Senator Joe Biden. At that time, his host was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Kemal Kurspahić.

In 1993, it was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. The editors of &quot;Oslobođenje&quot;, Kemal Kurspahić and Gordana Knežević, were named International Editors of the Year for 1993 by the World Press Review in New York, for their &quot;bravery, tenacity, and dedication to the principles of journalism.&quot; Duo also received the Courage in Journalism Award in 1992 from the International Women&#x27;s Media Foundation in Washington, D.C.. Kurspahić was also recipient of the Nieman Fellowship for Journalism at Harvard University in 1994, among other honors. Immediately after the war ended in 1995, editor-in-chief Mehmed Halilović accepted the University of Missouri [Mizzou] Honor Medal from the School of Journalism in Columbia, Missouri for continuous publication of the daily newspaper throughout the 1992–95 siege of Sarajevo. Editor Zlatko Dizdarević won several international awards, including: ‘Reporters sans frontieres-Fondation de France’ in Paris, the ‘Bruno Kreisky’ prize for human rights in Vienna, and the &#x27;Paolo Borssalino’ prize for journalistic courage in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://eu.boell.org/en/person/zlatko-dizdarevic&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, its staff, consisting of Bosniaks, Bosnian Serbs, and Bosnian Croats, managed to print the paper every day, with one exception.

In 2006, the company was bought by way of the Sarajevo Stock Exchange by the Sarajevska pivara. In addition to the Oslobođenje daily, this publishing house today has digital platforms - the &quot;Oslobođenje&quot;, &quot;Dani&quot; and &quot;Sport1&quot; portals. As part of this corporation, there is also &quot;Dječja štampa&quot; (&quot;Male novine&quot;, &quot;Vesela sveska&quot;, &quot;Vesela sveska sveznalica&quot;), as well as television channels &quot;O Kanal&quot;, &quot;O Kanal Plus&quot; and &quot;O Kanal Music&quot;.

Their news website Avaz.ba is the third most visited website in Bosnia and Herzegovina, after Google and YouTube.&lt;ref name=&quot;alexa /BA&quot;&gt;Top Sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina , &quot;alexa.com&quot;, Accessed 2021-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
&quot;Dnevni avaz&quot; evolved from a weekly publication &quot;Bošnjački avaz&quot; which was first published in September 1993. In 1994, it became known simply as &quot;Avaz&quot; and was published weekly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Germany. In 1995, it was reestablished by Fahrudin Radončić as a daily newspaper.

&quot;Dnevni avaz&quot; is part of the &quot;avaz-roto press&quot; publishing house, the biggest media house in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The paper is based in Sarajevo and has a relative pro-Bosniak and pro-Bosnian stance (centre-right).

In 2006, the Avaz publishing house was expanded with the start of the construction of the Avaz Twist Tower, a 175 m skyscraper in Sarajevo’s Marijin Dvor neighborhood, in the Centar Municipality of Sarajevo. As of 2016, it was the tallest skyscraper in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

The company&#x27;s former headquarters, the Avaz Business Centre, has been converted into a hotel, Radon Plaza Hotel.

<text>Henri Bencolin is a fictional detective created by John Dickson Carr. He was Carr&#x27;s first series detective, appearing in five &quot;locked-room&quot; and &quot;impossible crime&quot; mystery novels in the 1930s, and four short stories that appeared even earlier. In later decades, Carr did not return to the Bencolin character, but instead focused on creating English sleuths such as Dr. Gideon Fell and Sir Henry Merrivale. 

==Biography==
Bencolin is a &quot;juge d&#x27;instruction&quot; (examining magistrate) in the Paris judicial system, and occasionally takes private cases. During World War I, he served as a French spymaster. Bencolin has a forbidding appearance. The narrator of the stories, American writer Jeff Marle, describes him as looking &quot;Satanic&quot;, and characterizes his manner with witnesses and suspects as sometimes very harsh. He is sophisticated and cultured, and written to appeal to an American audience that would associate France and French people with sophistication.

==List of stories==
===Short stories===
The short stories in which Bencolin appears were all originally published in the Haverfordian:

*&quot;The Shadow of the Goat&quot;
*&quot;The Fourth Suspect&quot;
*&quot;The End of Justice&quot;
*&quot;The Murder In Number Four&quot; (1928)

===Novels===
*&quot;It Walks By Night&quot; (1930)
*&quot;The Lost Gallows&quot; (1931)
*&quot;Castle Skull&quot; (1931 – not published in the UK until c. 1980)
*&quot;The Waxworks Murder&quot; (1932)
*&quot;The Four False Weapons&quot; (1937)

==Spin-off==
Bencolin is mentioned in Carr&#x27;s book &quot;Poison in Jest&quot; (1932), but does not appear in it. The novel, however, is narrated by Marle.

<text>The Sarajevo Film Festival is the premier and largest film festival in Southeast Europe, and is one of the largest film festivals in Europe. It was founded in Sarajevo in 1995 during the siege of Sarajevo in the Bosnian War, and brings international and local celebrities to Sarajevo every year. It is held in August and showcases an extensive variety of feature and short films from around the world. The current director of the festival is Jovan Marjanović.

==History==
In October 1993, a ten-day Sarajevo International Film Festival was held, directed by Haris Pašović of MESS. The success of this event, combined with the legacy of Mirsad Purivatra&#x27;s and Izeta Građević&#x27;s wartime film screenings from 1992, led to the establishment of an annual festival.

The first Sarajevo Film Festival was held from 25 October to 5 November 1995. At that time, the siege of Sarajevo was still going on and attendance projections were very low. However, a surprising 15,000 people came to see the films, of which there were 37 from 15 different countries. The festival grew at a remarkable pace, now being the most prominent film festival in Southeast Europe, attracting more than 100,000 people annually on all programs and screening hundreds of films from 60 countries.

The Sarajevo Film Festival is hosted at the National Theatre in front of which the Festival Square and the red carpet are located, with screenings at the Open-air theater Metalac, Bosnian Cultural Center, Meeting Point Cinema and five other cinemas and projection locations around the city. The festival has been attended by celebrities such as Robert De Niro, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Emile Hirsch, Orlando Bloom, Daniel Craig, Danny Glover, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Oliver Stone, John Cleese, Steve Buscemi, Michael Fassbender, Jeremy Irons, Juliette Binoche, Bono Vox, Coolio, Mickey Rourke, Michael Moore, Gérard Depardieu, Darren Aronofsky, Gillian Anderson, Kevin Spacey, Eric Cantona, Benicio del Toro, Tim Roth, Mads Mikkelsen, Jesse Eisenberg, Alexander Payne, Meg Ryan and many others.

By 2001, the European Film Association made the Sarajevo Film Festival one of the eleven festivals that could nominate a film for the award of &quot;Europe&#x27;s Best Short Film&quot;. The 2001 winner of the Sarajevo Film Festival, Danis Tanović&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, went on to win an Oscar in the United States. In 2004, the Best Movie Award was named the &quot;Heart of Sarajevo&quot;.

Beginning with the 13th Sarajevo Film Festival in 2007 and in cooperation with the Berlin International Film Festival and Berlinale Talent Campus, the Sarajevo Talent Campus has been added to the festival. In 2014, the Sarajevo Talent Campus got renamed to &quot;Talents Sarajevo&quot;. Talents Sarajevo is an educational and creative platform for up and coming young film professionals, and has eventually come to be revered as the most prestigious film training event in the region.

The festival also features CineLink, a year-long project development program resulting in an annual co-production market during the festival dates. The CineLink Market each year presents about 10 finest regional projects for feature-length fiction films, also offering festival guests a special opportunity to meet with the assembled regional industry, with emphasis on young filmmakers, producers and directors presenting their latest projects, productions and works in progress, with highlights of the regional production presented to international distributors, TV-buyers and festival programmers, making CineLink the most important international market place for new features from Southeast Europe.

The first edition of CineLink, which was part of the 9th Sarajevo Film Festival, was held in 2003. Of the 91 entries from across the region, a three-member jury, Philippe Bober, Behrooz Hashemian and Čedomir Kolar, producers whose films have won awards at all the major international film festivals such as Cannes, Venice, Rotterdam and Berlin, chose six winning films, and the winners were: &quot;The Abandoned&quot; - Zlatko Topčić, &quot;Bosnian Pot&quot; - Vedran Fajković, &quot;Slowly&quot; - Nikola Mišić, &quot;Totally Personal&quot; - Nedžad Begović, &quot;Roses for Tosca&quot; - Branko Đurić, Simona Stražisar and &quot;Last Day&quot; - Namik Kabil.

In 2019, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded the Sarajevo Film Festival the status of the Academy Award qualifying film festival in the Short Film category. Short films that win the Heart of Sarajevo Award and the nomination for the European Film Academy (EFA) short film award at the Sarajevo Film Festival will be eligible for consideration in the Animated Short Film and Live Action Short Film category of the Academy Awards without the standard theatrical run, provided that they otherwise comply with the Academy rules.

<text>The Transportation Distinguished Service Medal was the highest decoration which could be bestowed by the Secretary of Transportation for exceptional service to the United States government in a position of great responsibility to a member of the United States Coast Guard. In 2003 it was replaced by the Homeland Security Distinguished Service Medal.

The Department of Transportation Distinguished Service Medal was established by signed by President George H. W. Bush on December 7, 1992. The decoration was awarded to any member of the Coast Guard who provided exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility while assigned in the Department of Transportation, or in other activities under the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation, either national or international, as may be assigned by the Secretary.

With the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 and transfer of the Coast Guard to it, the award was changed to become the Homeland Security Distinguished Service Medal, issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security.

<text>Cycloneuralia is a proposed clade of ecdysozoan animals including the Scalidophora (Kinorhynchans, Loriciferans, Priapulids), the Nematoida (nematodes, Nematomorphs), and the extinct Palaeoscolecida. It may be paraphyletic, or may be a sister group to Panarthropoda. Or perhaps Panarthropoda is paraphyletic with respect to Cycloneuralia. The group has also been considered a single phylum, sometimes given the old name Nemathelminthes. The uniting character is the nervous system organization with a circumpharyngeal brain and somata–neuropil–somata pattern.
The name derives from the position of the brain around the pharynx.

<text>John Howard Van Amringe (April 3, 1835 – September 10, 1915) was an American educator and mathematician.

==Life and career==
Van Amringe was born in Philadelphia on April 3, 1835. He was a son of William Frederick Van Amringe (1791–1873) and Susan Budd (née Stirling) Van Amringe (1798–1891). Among his siblings was brother, Thomas Budd Van Amringe.

He entered Columbia University in 1856 and graduated from the school with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1860. Three years later, he received a Master of Arts, and in 1890, he was made a Doctor of Literature.

Amringe died on September 10, 1915 in Morristown, New Jersey.

==Career==
While still an undergraduate, he taught mathematics at Columbia, taking his junior classes in Greek. He became a full-fledged member of the faculty in the fall of 1860, becoming a full professor in 1865 and teaching until his retirement in 1910. During 1864 to 1865, he was also a lecturer in the School of Mines.

After serving as Dean of the School of Fine Arts in 1895, Van Amringe succeeded Seth Low to become the first Dean of Columbia College, the university&#x27;s undergraduate school of arts and sciences, which he defended from dismemberment and incorporation into the larger university. During his long presence at the school, he made many addresses and enjoyed unrivaled popularity.

Van Amringe also served as the first president of the American Mathematical Society from 1888 and 1890 and was a member of the New-York Historical Society and the American Society for the Advancement of Science.

He is memorialized with a bust enshrined in a column-supported cupola on &quot;Van Am Quad&quot; in the southeastern portion of the campus, surrounded by three Columbia College dormitories (John Jay Hall, Hartley Hall, and Wallach Hall) and by the main College academic building, Hamilton Hall. The Memorial was built in 1917 and 1918, and was dedicated on Commencement Day in 1918.

==Personal life==
Van Amringe was married to Cornelia Bucknor (1838–1914), the daughter of William Goelet Bucknor. Cornelia was the great-granddaughter of Peter Goelet, a wealthy merchant and real estate entrepreneur in New York City. Together, Cornelia and John were the parents of:

* Emily Van Amringe (1867–1955), who died not marry.
* Guy Van Amringe (1869–1936), a magistrate of the New York Municipal Court.

Van Amringe died suddenly on September 10, 1915, at the Keeler House in Morristown, New Jersey. After a funeral conducted by the Rev. Dr. William T. Manning (later the 10th Bishop of New York), Rector of Trinity Church (where he was a Vestryman), he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

===Honors and legacy===
Van Amringe received a number of honorary degrees including Ph.D. from the University of the State of New York in 1877 and an LL.D. from Union College in 1895.

In honor of Van Amringe, Columbia University&#x27;s Department of Mathematics has presented a &quot;Van Amringe Mathematical Prize&quot; each year (since 1911) to the best freshman or sophomore mathematics student, based on a very challenging examination.

<text>Chew Magna is a village and civil parish within the Chew Valley in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, in the ceremonial county of Somerset, England. The parish has a population of 1,149.

To the south of the village is Chew Valley Lake. The village is on the B3130 road, about from Bristol, from Bath, from the city of Wells, and from Bristol Airport.

The village is close to the northern edge of the Mendip Hills (a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), and was designated a conservation area in 1978.
There are many listed buildings reflecting the history of the village. The River Chew flows through the village. Just outside the village is Chew Magna Reservoir: this small Bristol Water supply reservoir intercepts the Winford Brook.

There is one primary school, and an adjacent secondary school, several shops and small businesses, three churches, and three pubs serving the area. There is also a football pitch and children&#x27;s play area. The village frequently wins regional categories in the Calor Village of the Year competition, and is currently moving towards zero waste status, having been described as &quot;probably the greenest parish in Britain&quot;.

== History ==
Chew Magna has long been the largest village in the district, and can trace its importance back to Saxon times. It was a thriving woollen centre in the Middle Ages. In 1086, it had 108 households rendering £46 per year, most of its land being cultivated and having five mills, 29 cattle, 36 pigs, 448 sheep and 46 goats. It acquired market town and non-represented borough status. 22 of these households were serfs.

The manor of Chew was held by the Bishops of Bath and Wells from 1062 to 1548, and therefore was called Chew Episcopi or Bishop&#x27;s Chew. The bishops built a palace near the church of St Andrews, which was visited by Henry III in 1250. During the king&#x27;s visit, a number of items were stolen including a ruby, gold coins and a &#x27;crested&#x27; box, the latter being one of Henry&#x27;s personal effects. An inscription referring to this event was once visible in the main entrance to the manor, but has since been obscured by more modern repairs. Chew Court is a surviving part of the palace and has its adjacent well head also listed for its long heritage.

According to Robinson its manors, lay and religious holdings formed an episcopal property held, as overlord, by Giso, the last Saxon bishop and the name Magna comes from the Latin meaning &#x27;the greater&#x27;. This is supported by the Domesday Book which was made to specify the 1086 and the pre-conquest holder, in both instances given as the &quot;Bishop of Wells&quot;. Hence its benefice was from the early medieval period converted from a rectory to a vicarage, with substantial tythings adjoining named Bishop Sutton, Knowle with Knighton Sutton, North Elm, and Stone. Furthermore, it had the living of Dundry annexed to it. By 1848 all tithes had been commuted and the sole impropriator is listed in 1848 of the great tithes as George Smyth.

The parish was part of the hundred of Chew.

In the eastern corner of the south aisle of the church is a monument of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a window of the aisle, is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III&#x27;s, who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.
A c. 13th-century carved sundial is still visible, although eroded, to the right of the church&#x27;s door, and can be used to tell the time by carefully inserting a small stick to act as a gnomon. Midday is marked by a vertical line; post-meridian hours are to the right of this line.

=== After the Dissolution of the Monasteries ===
Since about 1600, the name changed to Chew Magna as this has been the most important of the several villages along the banks of the River Chew and reflecting the reduced wealth of the established church from the Dissolution of the Monasteries onwards.

Around 1700 the Lord of the Manor was Sir William Jones, the Attorney General of England and in the 1820s it was the seat of Lord Lyttelton.
Until about 1880 the village had toll roads and a toll house to collect the fees.

By 1848 the population was partly employed in coal mines in Bishop Sutton, and in the manufacture of stockings and of edge tools to a limited extent; formerly there was a factory for cloth.

During the late 19th and 20th centuries the importance of the wool trade in the village declined and it became largely a dormitory area for the cities of Bristol and Bath, although it has continued to be the commercial centre of the valley throughout the decades, including the villages renowned Fairfield Nursery, managed by the Hiron’s.

=== Second World War ===

During German bombing raids targeted on Bristol, many bombs fell in the parish: Ruen House on the road to Chew Hill was bombed. The nearly flat area just east of the Y-junction on Chew Hill was initially chosen as a Starfish site area to be lit by fires to simulate Bristol in flames. Later, about halfway between North Chew Farm and Manor Farm, North Wick was an area secured by Royal Air Force personnel, lit by fires, and with &quot;automatic&quot; guns to simulate anti-aircraft guns. There was also a genuine heavy anti aircraft battery at Chewhill farm. The area was guarded by pill boxes of which one remains on the west side of Blacklands (map reference ST579640).

=== Chew Valley Lake Construction ===
The construction of Chew Valley Lake in the 1950s brought opportunities for leisure and tourism.

=== 1968 storm ===
On 10–11 July 1968 a storm brought heavy rainfall to the Chew valley and Dundry, with falling in 18 hours on Chew Stoke, which is double the area&#x27;s average rainfall for the whole of July. This caused flooding to 88 properties in Chew Magna with many being inundated with of water. The bridge on the road to Dundry was demolished.

=== Telephone exchange ===
The Chew Magna telephone exchange was manually operated until the 1950s. An important number Chew Magna 2 was that of Dr Terrell Hughes: the exchange operators could often locate him in an emergency even if he was away from his home and surgery. The manual exchange served most of the Chew valley and even East Dundry.

== Government and politics ==
Chew Magna has its own parish council, which has some responsibility for local issues, and is part of the Chew Valley North Ward. This is represented by one councillor on the Bath and North East Somerset Unitary Authority, which has wider responsibilities for services such as education, refuse, tourism, etc. The village is a part of the North East Somerset and Hanham constituency. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2001 Census the Chew Valley North Ward (which includes Chew Magna and Chew Stoke), had 2,307 residents, living in 911 households, with an average age of 42.3 years. Of these, 77% of residents described their health as &#x27;good&#x27;; 21% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.3% of all economically active people aged 16–74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 26,243 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.

== Buildings of interest ==
=== Church ===
St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Chew Magna dates from the 12th century, with a large 15th-century pinnacled sandstone tower, a Norman font and a rood screen that is the full width of the church. In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of Sutton Court, together with a wooden effigy of a Knight cross-legged and leaning on one elbow, in 15th-century armour, thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished.
Another effigy in the north chapel is of Sir John St Loe, who was over tall, and his lady. The armoured figure is long and his feet rest on a lion, while those of his lady rest on a dog. The tomb of Sir Edward Baber (1530-1578) son of Sir John Baber, is housed within the church alongside his wife Lady Catherine Leigh-Baber, daughter to Sir Thomas Leigh.

The church was restored in 1860 and has a register commencing in 1562. The tower is about one hundred feet tall and was probably built about 1440.
There has been a clock on the tower since the early 1700s. There is a peal of eight bells in the tower (Tenor 28 cwt ( in C). The original five bells were re-cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six, and in 1898 four of these were re-cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Two additional bells, the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the octave, which still contains two of the Bilbie bells. The present clock, installed in 1903, plays a verse of a hymn every four hours, at 8 am, noon, 4 and 8 pm, with a different hymn tune for every day of the week. The church is a Grade I listed building.

The churchyard contains several monuments which are Grade II listed buildings in their own right: the churchyard cross,
Edgell monument,
Fowler monument
and a group of three unidentified monuments. In addition there is an early 19th-century limestone round-topped stone which bears the inscription to William Fowler &quot;shot by an Highwayman on
Dundry Hill 14 June 1814 aged 32 years&quot; and a Commonwealth war grave of a Royal Air Force officer of World War II. Within the church are wooden plaques commemorating the nineteen people from the village who died in World War I
and seven from World War II,
and a bronze plaque to an individual soldier who died in 1917.

=== Other buildings ===

Next to the church is the Church House, which is also known as the Old School Room. The upstairs room was the local school from the mid or early 15th century, with the village poorhouse below. This has been a venue for social activity in the village and in 1971 underwent major renovation. It is a Grade II* listed building. Also close to the church is Chew Court, which was originally a bishop&#x27;s palace. It was largely rebuilt in 1656, from which a little survives as the Chew Court of today including an Elizabethan doorway with Doric pilasters. The room over the gatehouse is said to have been used as a court-room, with the turrets used for holding prisoners. Chew Court is a Grade II* listed building.

The Manor House has Tudor origins, including a fireplace dated 1656, with a Gothic exterior from 1874, largely redesigned by John Norton. Amongst the brought-in pieces in the house are two South German reliefs, &quot;The Martyrdoms of St Catherine and St Sebastian&quot;, from an altar of the early 16th century. There are also a series of panels in the Floris style, probably Flemish and with a repeating date 1562.
From 1680 to 1844 the Manor House was the home of prominent Quaker families including the Vickris, the Summers and the Harfords. William Penn preached here in 1687. The house has of gardens laid out in the 19th century. The house is a Grade II* listed building and now forms part of the Sacred Heart Convent School.
Two of the stables attached to the Manor House are Grade II listed.
The high street contains many old buildings. The Beeches was built in 1762, with walls, railings, gates and piers of the same date, although the side wings were added later. Acacia House and Igbetti House, which was formerly known as Myrtle House, are from the same period, while Barle House, Holly House, The Sycamores and Portugal House are slightly more recent.

On Battle Lane is the 18th-century Rookstone House, which was formerly the end house in a row of seven, and The Rookery and its lodge, which were built in the early 19th century. Harford Square is dominated by the construction, in 1817, of Harford House and its accompanying stable block.

Just south of the village is the medieval Tun Bridge with three pointed arches including double arch rings, spanning over the river, approached along one of the high pavements that are a feature of the village centre. It has three pointed arches, two of which have double arch rings built in two orders. At its widest point it is wide and in the centre. The two main arches are separated by a sharp cutwater and tapering to above which a string course runs throughout the length of bridge. The bridge is thought to date from the late 15th century and is a Grade II listed building
and a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Avon No. 159). The raised pavement and steps are themselves also listed Grade II.

Surrounding the village are several historic farmhouses including Dumper&#x27;s Farmhouse, which dates from the 15th century, and Knole Hill Farmhouse, dated 1763.

== Schools ==
Chew Magna Primary School
won a Becta award for the use of ICT in Practice in 2005 for using the adventure exploration computer game &quot;Myst&quot; to support literacy and communication.

Chew Valley School is the main secondary school (11–18 years) for the valley.
It is situated between Chew Magna and Chew Stoke. The latest (2015) Ofsted Inspection Report describes this specialist Performing Arts College as a mixed comprehensive school with 1,160 pupils on roll, including 186 students in the sixth form. It says the school is popular and oversubscribed, and has been successful in gaining a number of national and regional awards. It received a &quot;good&quot; rating overall, down from &quot;outstanding&quot; at the last inspection (2011)

== Go Zero project ==
Chew Magna is the home of the &quot;Go Zero&quot; project, which promotes education for sustainability at all levels in society, seeking to conserve and make improvements to the environment in the UK and overseas. The four groups within Go Zero are: Transport and Energy (which includes Dragonflyer Mobility, a plan to develop a range of integrated services that offer communities in the West of England cost-effective, flexible and environmentally sustainable transport); People and Consumption (farmers&#x27; markets, local food, skill swaps); Converging World (which supports campaigns and initiatives for social justice and development and is currently pursuing Fair Trade status for Chew Magna); and Waste and Recycling. It is based at Tunbridge Mill, a post-medieval watermill.

== Sport and recreation ==
Chew Magna has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V. Gymnasium facilities, squash courts, badminton etc., and outdoor all-weather pitches are available at the Chew Valley Leisure Centre between Chew Magna and Chew Stoke. There is a range of clubs and societies for young and old, including Scout groups, gardening society, and the Women&#x27;s Institute. There is a cricket pitch and teams in Chew Magna.

In 2011, residents of Chew Magna and surrounding villages banded together to form a new charity, the Chew Valley Youth Trust, to combat the declining provision in leisure and recreational activities for young people in the region. In response to the closure of local Youth Clubs and declining state support for local transport, the charity combats issues of rural isolation and provides young residents with recreational activities.

<doc id="751354" wikidata="Q362360" url="?curid=751354" title="Norm Van Brocklin">
<text>Norman Mack Van Brocklin (March 15, 1926 – May 2, 1983), nicknamed &quot;the Dutchman&quot;, was an American professional football player, coach and executive. He played as a quarterback and punter in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons. He spent his first nine seasons with the Los Angeles Rams and his final three with the Philadelphia Eagles. Following his playing career, he was the inaugural head coach of the Minnesota Vikings from 1961 to 1966 and the second head coach of the Atlanta Falcons from 1968 to 1974.

Van Brocklin played college football for the Oregon Webfoots, earning All-America honors, but was not selected by the Rams until the fourth round of the 1949 NFL draft due to concerns over his professional availability. During his first three seasons, he and teammate Bob Waterfield alternated as the starting quarterback, culminating with them leading Los Angeles to victory in the 1951 championship game. After Waterfield retired, Van Brocklin served as the Rams primary starter from 1952 to 1957, concluding his tenure with six consecutive Pro Bowl selections and a passing-yards leading season in 1954. He joined Philadelphia in 1958, where his three seasons all saw him receive further Pro Bowl selections, bringing his total to nine. In his final season, he was named NFL Most Valuable Player en route to winning the 1960 championship.

As the head coach of the expansion Vikings and Falcons, Van Brocklin had less success and was unable to reach the postseason with either team. Nevertheless, he recorded the first winning season for both franchises. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1966 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971.

==Early life==
Born in Parade, South Dakota, Van Brocklin was one of nine children of Mack and Ethel Van Brocklin. His father was a watchmaker. The family moved to Northern California and settled in Walnut Creek, east of Oakland. Van Brocklin was a three-sport standout at Acalanes High School in Lafayette, where he quarterbacked the football team to a 5–3 record as a sophomore and a 4–2–2 record as a junior. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1943 through 1945, foregoing his senior year of high school.

==College career==
Following World War II, Van Brocklin followed two former high school teammates north and enrolled at the University of Oregon in Eugene. He became the starting quarterback in 1947 under first-year head coach Jim Aiken, and led the Ducks to a 16–5 record in his two seasons as a starter. In 1948, Oregon tied with California for the title of the Pacific Coast Conference, forerunner of the Pac-12. California was undefeated overall, and Oregon&#x27;s only loss was at undefeated Michigan, that year&#x27;s national champions, and the Ducks had seven victories in the PCC to Cal&#x27;s six. Oregon did not go to the Rose Bowl, however, because Cal was voted by the other schools to represent the PCC in the game. Oregon needed only a 5–5 tie vote, as Cal had been to the game more recently, and with six Northwest schools and four in California, appeared favored to advance. Oregon had opted for a playoff game, but California declined. Among the Cal voters was the University of Washington, which elevated the intensity of the Oregon-Washington rivalry. Breaking with tradition, the PCC allowed Oregon to accept an invitation to play SMU in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. It was the first time that a Pacific Coast team played in a major bowl game other than the Rose Bowl (a policy which was continued by the Pac-8 through 1974). Both Oregon and California lost their New Year&#x27;s Day bowl games. That season, Van Brocklin was honored with an All-America selection and finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting. Coincidentally, the Heisman Trophy winner that year was SMU running back Doak Walker. Both Walker and Van Brocklin got Outstanding Player recognition for their performance in the Cotton Bowl Classic.

Van Brocklin left Oregon for the NFL with one remaining year of college eligibility. At that time, a player was not allowed to join the NFL until four years after graduating from high school. Though he had only been at the University of Oregon for three years, he was eligible due to his time in the Navy during World War II. At age 23, he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in June 1949.

==Professional playing career==
===Los Angeles Rams===
Van Brocklin was selected 37th overall in the 1949 NFL draft, taken in the fourth round by the Los Angeles Rams. Teams were not sure if he planned to play the 1949 season in college, so he fell in the draft, conducted in December 1948. Van Brocklin signed with the Rams in July and joined a team that already had a star quarterback, Bob Waterfield. Beginning in 1950, new Rams coach Joe Stydahar solved his problem by platooning Waterfield and Van Brocklin. The 1950 Rams scored a then-record 466 points (38.8 per game – which is still a record) with a high octane passing attack featuring Tom Fears and Elroy &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; Hirsch. Fears led the league and set a new NFL record with 84 receptions. Van Brocklin and Waterfield finished 1–2 in passer rating as well. They were defeated by the Cleveland Browns in the 1950 title game, 30–28.

In 1951, Van Brocklin and Waterfield again split quarterbacking duties and the Rams again won the West. That year, Hirsch set an NFL record with 1,495 receiving yards and tied Don Hutson&#x27;s record of 17 touchdown receptions. This time, the Rams won the title rematch against Cleveland, 24–17. Waterfield (9–24, 125 yards) took most of the snaps at the L.A. Coliseum, but Van Brocklin (4–6, 128 yards) threw a game-winning 73-yard touchdown pass to Fears. It was the Rams&#x27; only NFL championship while originally based in southern California; their next came in 1999, several years after the move east to St. Louis. After returning to Los Angeles for the 2016 season, the Rams subsequently won Super Bowl LVI in 2022.

Earlier in 1951 on opening night, Van Brocklin threw for an NFL record 554 yards on September 28, breaking Johnny Lujack&#x27;s single-game record of 468 set two years earlier. Waterfield was injured so Van Brocklin played the entire game and completed 27 of 41 attempts with five touchdowns. Despite the increase in passing attacks by NFL teams in recent years, the yardage record still stands, set .

Waterfield retired after the 1952 season and Van Brocklin continued to quarterback the Rams, leading them to the title game again in 1955, hosted at the L.A. Coliseum. In that game, the visiting Browns crushed the Rams 38–14 as Van Brocklin threw six interceptions. In early January 1958, he announced his retirement from pro football after nine seasons and had plans to enter private business in Oregon at Portland.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
Less than five months later in late May, Van Brocklin changed his mind and was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles for two players (offensive lineman Buck Lansford and defensive end Jimmy Harris) and a first round draft pick. It was disclosed he did not want to play another season for the Rams under head coach Sid Gillman&#x27;s offense, but it was not a personality issue with Gillman. Under famed head coach Buck Shaw, Van Brocklin was given total control of the offense in Philadelphia in 1958, and he steadily improved the Eagles&#x27; attack. In his third and final season with Philly in 1960, the team had the best regular season record in league at 10–2, and hosted the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Championship Game at Franklin Field. Throwing to his favorite receiver, Tommy McDonald, Van Brocklin led the Eagles to victory. In a game dominated by defense, he led a fourth quarter comeback, resulting in a final score of 17–13.

During his twelve-year career, Van Brocklin played on two NFL championship teams: the 1951 Los Angeles Rams and the 1960 Philadelphia Eagles. Following the latter triumph, he retired. As it turned out, the Eagles were the only team to defeat the Packers in a playoff game during Vince Lombardi&#x27;s tenure as Green Bay&#x27;s head coach. Van Brocklin led the NFL in passing three times and in punting twice. On nine occasions, he was selected to the Pro Bowl. He was a first team All-Pro for the 1960 season.

==Coaching career==

===Minnesota Vikings===

Van Brocklin cut his ties with the Eagles after his belief that the team had reneged on an agreement to name him head coach to replace the retiring Buck Shaw. On January 18, 1961, he accepted the head coaching position for the expansion Minnesota Vikings, less than a month after winning the NFL Championship game. During his six years with Minnesota, Van Brocklin compiled a record of 29–51–4 (). The tenure was highlighted by his contentious relationship with quarterback Fran Tarkenton. Van Brocklin was displeased with Tarkenton&#x27;s penchant for scrambling, preferring that he stay in the pocket. The feud culminated with Tarkenton&#x27;s demand for a trade and Van Brocklin&#x27;s surprise resignation on February 11, 1967. Tarkenton was traded to the New York Giants shortly after Van Brocklin&#x27;s departure, but was reacquired by Van Brocklin&#x27;s successor, Bud Grant, five years later in 1972. One thing Van Brocklin was known for was his disdain for soccer-style kickers (now the standard in the NFL). In one game, soccer-style kicker Garo Yepremian beat Van Brocklin&#x27;s team and after the game, a reporter asked how he felt about losing the game on a last-second field goal, and he replied &quot;They ought to change the god-damned immigration laws in this country&quot;. However, Van Brocklin did end up having a soccer-style kicker in Nick Mike-Mayer in his final two seasons as coach of the Atlanta Falcons, in 1973 and 1974.

During his first year off the field in over two decades, Van Brocklin served as a commentator on NFL broadcasts in 1967 for CBS.

===Atlanta Falcons===
In 1968, Van Brocklin took over as head coach of the Atlanta Falcons on October 1, replacing Norb Hecker, who had started the season with three defeats, extending the team losing streak to ten games. Over the next seven seasons, Van Brocklin had mixed results, putting together a 37–49–3 mark. He led the team to its first winning season in 1971 with a 7–6–1 record, then challenged for a playoff spot in 1973 with a 9–5 mark. His 1973 Falcons handed the Fran Tarkenton-led, 9–0 Minnesota Vikings its first defeat, on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. However, after winning just two of his first eight games in 1974, he was fired.

==Head coaching record==
==Final years==
Following his dismissal, Van Brocklin returned to his pecan farm in Social Circle, Georgia, east of Atlanta. His only connections to football during this era were as a running backs coach for Georgia Tech under head coach Pepper Rodgers in 1979, who was fired that December. It was his only stint as an assistant coach. Rodgers&#x27;s successor Bill Curry brought in a new staff in 1980 and Van Brocklin then was a college football analyst on &quot;Superstation&quot; WTBS in Atlanta.

Van Brocklin, a heavy cigarette smoker, suffered a number of illnesses, including a brain tumor. After it was removed, he told the press, &quot;It was a brain transplant. They gave me a sportswriter&#x27;s brain, to make sure I got one that hadn&#x27;t been used.&quot; He died of a heart attack in 1983 at age 57, five weeks after former teammate Bob Waterfield.

Van Brocklin was posthumously elected to the University of Oregon Athletics Hall of Fame in 1992.

<text>Alejandrina Benítez de Gautier (February 26, 1819 – October 11, 1879) was a Puerto Rican poet.

==Early years==
Benítez de Gautier, (birth name: Alejandrina Benítez De Arce) was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico and became an orphan at an early age. She moved to San Juan and lived with her aunt, the poet and author María Bibiana Benítez who raised her and looked after her education.

==Poet==
Benítez de Gautier, inspired by her aunt, became an accomplished poet. She became a member of a group of young writers which were considered as the members of the first generation of the Puerto Rican poets and writers who founded what is known as Puerto Rican literary culture. Benítez de Gautier gained recognition as a poet with her collaboration in the &quot;Aguinaldo Puertorriqueño&quot; (Collection of Puerto Rican Poetry) which was published in 1843 gave her recognition as a poet.

Benítez de Gautier wrote a poem entitled &quot;La Patria del Genio&quot; (The Nation of the Genius) dedicated to Jose Campeche; for this poem she was awarded 100 Spanish pesos from the &quot;La Sociedad Económica Amigos del País&quot; (Friends of the Economic Society of Puerto Rico).

She had an affair with a provisional intendant, Rodulfo Gautier and on November 12, 1851, bore him her first child, José Gautier Benítez who was to become a famous poet, out of wedlock in the City of Caguas, Puerto Rico. She later married Rudolfo (thus adding de Gautier to her surname) and legitimized her relationship. She moved with her husband to his farmstead in Caguas and became involved in the slave trade business. In 1857, her husband died and the widow moved once more to San Juan with her aunt.

Benítez de Gautier did not write any poems from 1846 to 1861. In 1861, new poems by Benítez de Gautier which were published in the local journals began to appear. Among her best known poem of the time was &quot;A Submarine Cable to Puerto Rico&quot;. In said poem she pays tribute to the knowledge and engineering that went into the establishment of telegraph service between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas. Her youngest daughter was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and died from the illness in 1875, the same year that her aunt died. Benítez de Gautier died in 1879 at the age of 60. She was buried at the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan

==Legacy==
New York City has honoured her memory by naming a school after her in her honour. The school is located in area of the borough of Brooklyn known as Bushwick. The official Department of Education designation of the school is P.S.377.

<text>Hannah Hoes Van Buren (born Hoes; March 8, 1783 – February 5, 1819) was the wife of the eighth President of the United States, Martin Van Buren. Very little is known about her. She died from tuberculosis in 1819, before Martin Van Buren became president. He never remarried and was one of the few Presidents to be unmarried while in office.

==Marriage and children==
Hannah Hoes married her childhood friend and cousin Martin Van Buren in 1807 when she was 23 and he was 24. She gave birth to five children, one of whom died in infancy.

==Death==
Hannah Hoes passed away from tuberculosis on February 5, 1819, at the age of 35. During Van Buren&#x27;s term, his daughter-in-law Angelica acted as hostess of the White House and First Lady of the United States. When writing his autobiography, Van Buren did not mention his wife once, possibly to shield her from public references.

<doc id="751366" wikidata="Q7527559" url="?curid=751366" title="Sir John Appleby">
<text>Sir John Appleby is a fictional detective created by Michael Innes in the 1930s who appeared in many novels and short stories.

==Character overview==
Appleby had perhaps the longest career of any of the great detectives. In &quot;Silence Observed&quot; he states that his age is fifty-three, which, if the action of the book takes place in the year of publication, would mean that he was born in 1907 or 1908. This is contradicted in &quot;The Gay Phoenix&quot; where he says that he was 29 when he married. He becomes engaged in &quot;Appleby&#x27;s End&quot;, published 1945, which would mean that he was born in 1916.

Appleby&#x27;s background remains enigmatic although certain clues emerge in several novels. He was born in Kirkby Overblow (as mentioned in &quot;Hare Sitting Up&quot;) and brought up in a back street in a Midlands town (&quot;Appleby&#x27;s Other Story&quot;). His grandfather had been a baker and he himself had won a scholarship to university (&quot;There Came Both Mist and Snow&quot;).

He first appeared as a youthful Detective Inspector from Scotland Yard in &quot;Death at the President&#x27;s Lodging&quot; (&quot;Seven Suspects&quot; in the United States) in 1936. He retired from Scotland Yard at a very early age just after World War II, on marrying Judith Raven, a sculptor first encountered in &quot;Appleby&#x27;s End&quot;. He had two younger sisters, Patricia (&quot;Stop Press&quot;) and Jane (&quot;Operation Pax&quot;), both of whom figure prominently in one novel each and then are never mentioned again.

He then reappeared as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, a position rewarded by a knighthood. Although he later retired to Long Dream Manor, his wife&#x27;s family home in the countryside, he continued to solve crimes well into the 1980s, his last appearance being in &quot;Appleby and the Ospreys&quot; in 1986, 50 years after his fictional debut. For a couple of the later tales his son Bobby serves as the chief protagonist.

In 2010, eighteen previously uncollected short stories appeared in &quot;Appleby Talks About Crime&quot;.

Appleby is mentioned in the Edmund Crispin novel &quot;Holy Disorders&quot; and the Isaac Asimov Union Club short story &quot;The Three Goblets.&quot;

<doc id="751372" wikidata="Q1338262" url="?curid=751372" title="Rutan Long-EZ">
<text>The Rutan Model 61 Long-EZ is a tandem 2-seater homebuilt aircraft designed by Burt Rutan&#x27;s Rutan Aircraft Factory. The Long-EZ has a canard layout, a swept wing with wingtip rudders, and a pusher engine and propeller. The tricycle landing gear has fixed main wheels with streamlined spats and a retractable nosewheel. Its predecessor was the VariEze, plans for which were first available to homebuilders in 1976. The prototype Long-EZ, N79RA, first flew on June 12, 1979.

==Design==
The Long-EZ was a scaled-up redesign of the VariEze predecessor, allowing for the use of readily available Lycoming aircraft engines instead of the Volkswagen-derived engines or hard-to-find small Continentals for which the VariEze was designed. Changes from the VariEze included a larger main wing with modified Eppler 1230 airfoil and less sweep, larger strakes containing more fuel and baggage storage, and a slightly wider cabin. The canard uses the same GU25-5(11)8 airfoil as the VariEze. Plans were offered from 1980 to 1985. There were about 700 FAA-registered Long-EZs in the United States in 2005, which had grown to 833 in 2021.

In January 1985 it was announced that plans for a new canard were being offered, to eliminate &quot;rain trim change&quot; that had been experienced by Long-EZ pilots. This trim change is usually a nose-down trim change experienced when flying into rain requiring a small aft force on the stick to maintain altitude, which is easily trimmed out, using the bungee trim system. The new canard was designed with the Roncz R1145MS airfoil, which produces considerably more lift than the original GU25-5(11)8 airfoil. This enabled the new canard to be designed with less span, reducing wetted area and thus drag. The new canard has a negligible rain trim, and rain adds only 2 knots to the stall speed.

The aircraft is designed for fuel-efficient long-range flight, with a range of just over .
It can fly for over ten hours and up to on 52 gallons (200 liters) of fuel.
Equipped with a rear-seat fuel tank, a Long-EZ flew for 4,800 miles (7,700 kilometers) in December 1979, still the record for aircraft weighing less than 1000 kg.

The pilot sits in a semi-reclined seat and controls the Long-EZ with a side-stick controller on the right-hand console. It has an airbrake on the underside, and the wing-tip rudders can be deflected outwards to act as auxiliary airbrakes.

In 1996 Burt Rutan awarded TERF Inc. the job of publishing the plans for the Long-EZ and other of his aircraft under The Rutan Aircraft Factory CD ROM Encyclopedia to further assist new builders and maintenance for existing builders. Some components for the design are supplied by Aircraft Spruce &amp; Specialty.

In 1997 Dick Rutan and Mike Melvill flew in convoy around the world in two Rutan Long-EZ aircraft that they had built. This &quot;around the world in 80 nights&quot; flight was called The Spirit of EAA Friendship World Tour, and some legs of it lasted for over 14 hours.

==Variants==
; E-Racer
: An extensively modified redesign using Long-EZ wings with a fuselage modified for side-by-side seating, retractable landing gear, and larger automotive engine conversion powerplants.
;EZ-rocket
:XCOR Aerospace modified a Long-EZ and replaced the engine with twin liquid-fueled rocket engines to form a flight test vehicle called the EZ-rocket, which was used as a proof-of-concept demonstrator. Initially, a follow-on version called the &quot;Mark-1 X-Racer, was going to be developed for the Rocket Racing League, but the Velocity SE was subsequently selected as the airframe for the Rocket Racer, rather than the Long-EZ.

;Twin EZ
:Ivan Shaw built a Long-EZ and then converted it into a &quot;Twin-EZ&quot;, an aircraft with twin wing-mounted Norton NR642 Wankel engines (precursors to the MidWest AE series). Shaw, a Yorkshireman, later designed the Europa XS kitplane.

;Long ESA
:A 258 hp electric engine conversion. On 19 July 2012, pilot Chip Yates achieved in level flight, making the aircraft the fastest man carrying electric powered aircraft.
;Berkez or Berk-EZ: Heavily modified Long-EZ with Berkut 360 components.

;Wright Stagger-EZ

:A Steve Wright three-seater design, using standard Long-EZ wings but with a dihedral canard and a rounder, more capacious fuselage. The pilot seat is standard Long-EZ, the co-pilot seat is offset to the right and 13&quot; rearward, and behind the pilot seat is a third seat for a passenger. The co-pilot has a control stick but no rudder pedals. Only one Stagger-EZ was built.

;Long-distance EZ (G-WILY)
:A standard Long-EZ modified by Bill Allen for long distance, with two wing droptanks for extra luggage and a large additional fuel tank in place of a passenger seat. Bill Allen also installed a Wilksch WAM diesel engine in one Long-EZ that he had built.

;Borealis

:Powered by a pulse detonation engine. The project was developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory and Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc.

==Specifications==
==Accidents and incidents==
As of February 2023, 114 Long-Ez aircraft have been lost in accidents, with 44 fatalities. 

*On February 28, 1990, Wallace Reid Jr. died after his Long-EZ crashed into the sea off Santa Monica after entering heavy fog.
*Singer-songwriter and actor John Denver died when his Long-EZ crashed on October 12, 1997, just off the coast at Pacific Grove, California. The NTSB believes that he inadvertently pushed on his right rudder pedal while twisting to the left in his seat as he struggled to operate the fuel selector valve, which on his aircraft had been moved by a previous owner to a position where it could more easily be reached from the passenger seat. Contributing factors in the Denver crash were other pilot errors, a design that led to an overly optimistic pre-flight fuel-check estimate, a known defective fuel valve that was very hard to turn, and non-standard placement of the fuel selector valve by the plane&#x27;s builder, at variance with Burt Rutan&#x27;s specifications. Denver was aware of the relocated valve prior to take off and had previously flown the aircraft only for approximately thirty minutes in an orientation flight the day before the accident, although he was an experienced pilot. The NTSB cited Denver&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the aircraft and his failure to have the aircraft refueled as causal factors in the accident. The aerodynamics of this unusual aircraft did not play a role in Denver&#x27;s crash.
*On December 20, 1997, the author James Gleick crash-landed his Long-EZ at Greenwood Lake Airport in West Milford, New Jersey. The pilot was on final approach when the engine lost power and landed short of the runway against rising terrain. Probable causes of this accident were deemed to be terrain conditions and the failure of the pilot to use carburetor heat, which resulted in carburetor ice. The pilot was seriously injured and the passenger, his young son, was killed.

<doc id="751377" wikidata="Q698634" url="?curid=751377" title="Arpad, Syria">
<text>Arpad (; or ; modern Tell Rifaat, Syria) was an ancient Aramaean Syro-Hittite city located in north-western Syria, north of Aleppo. It became the capital of the Aramaean state of Bit Agusi established by Gusi of Yakhan in the 9th century BC. Bit Agusi stretched from the A&#x27;zaz area in the north to Hamath in the south.

Arpad later became a major vassal city of the Kingdom of Urartu. In 743 BC, during the Urartu-Assyria War, the Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III laid siege to Arpad following the defeat of the Urartuan army of Sarduri II at Samsat. But the city of Arpad did not surrender easily. It took Tiglath-Pileser three years of siege to conquer Arpad, whereupon he massacred its inhabitants and destroyed the city. Afterward Arpad served as a provincial capital. Tell Rifaat, which is probably the remains of Arpad, has walls still preserved to a height of eight meters.

==Biblical references==
The city is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible:
*2 Kings 18:34; 19:13
*Isaiah 10:9; 36:19; 37:13
*Jeremiah 49:23, within the oracle against Damascus, one of the poetic &quot;oracles against foreign nations&quot; found in the later chapters of the Book of Jeremiah.

The Assyrian vizier, Rabshakeh, lists the god(s) of Arpad among those who he alleges have been unable to save their cities from Assyrian assault.

==Etymology==
The word Arpad in Hebrew means &#x27;the light of redemption&#x27;, or &#x27;I shall be spread out (or: supported)&#x27;

==Archaeology==
Tel Rifaat is an oval 250 by 233 meters. Within this, the main citadel is 142 by 142 meters with a maximum height of 30 meters. The defensive wall surrounding the site is about two miles long.

The site has been worked by a team from the Institute of Archaeology or the University of London. After a preliminary examination in 1956, Tell Rifa&#x27;at was excavated for two seasons in 1961 and 1964. The team was led by Veronica Seton-Williams.

In 1977, an archaeological survey was conducted of the area around Tell Rifa&#x27;at, also by the Institute of Archaeology.

Historically, it was hosted on both Cowan and Everson&#x27;s websites (branded as the North American and European sites, respectively); in 2002, the site was transitioned to be hosted exclusively on Everson&#x27;s site.

Since 2008, the ConScript Unicode Registry has been largely unmaintained; in 2008, Cowan explained that Everson was too busy to continue maintaining the project. Due to this inactivity, Rebecca Bettencourt founded the Under-ConScript Unicode Registry, aiming to coordinate code points for constructed languages until they can be formally added to the ConScript Unicode Registry. Scripts added to the Under-ConScript Unicode Registry include Sitelen Pona (for Toki Pona) and Cirth.

==Scripts==
The CSUR and UCSUR include the following scripts:

==Font support==
Some fonts support ConScript Unicode specified code points:
* Constructium, a proportional font based on SIL Gentium
* Fairfax, a monospaced font family intended for text editors and terminals
* GNU Unifont, a bitmap font intended as a fallback font, includes CSUR and UCSUR characters in the separate &quot;Unifont CSUR&quot; package
* Horta
* Kurinto Font Folio
* Nishiki-teki

<text>Sean Baker is a United States Air Force veteran who was injured in a training drill at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in 2003, and subsequently discharged.

==Background==
Baker was a member of the Kentucky Army National Guard. He served during the first Gulf War. In 2003 he was a member of the 438th Military Police at Guantanamo Bay.

==Incident==

In January 2003, Baker was ordered by an officer at Camp Delta to play the role of a prisoner in a training drill. As per instruction, Baker wore the standard Guantanamo captive&#x27;s uniforms, an orange prison jumpsuit, over his uniform and crawled under a bunk, so an &quot;internal reaction force&quot; consisting of four (possibly five) soldiers could practice extracting an uncooperative inmate from his cell. The soldiers in the riot squad thought that he was a genuine detainee who had assaulted a sergeant.

During an interview with WLEX, a Kentucky television station, Baker stated that he was beaten severely and that a soldier pressed his head down against the steel floor to the point where he became unable to breathe. Although Baker shouted out the safeword (&quot;red&quot;) he had been given to stop the exercise and stated that he was a U.S. soldier, the soldier continued beating Baker&#x27;s head against the floor and choking him. Only after he ripped his prison jumpsuit in the struggle, revealing that he was wearing a battle dress uniform and government-issue boots underneath, did the beating stop.

Baker was transported to a military hospital for treatment of head injuries and then transferred to a Navy hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia, where he was treated for six days and given a two-week injury discharge. During that discharge Baker began suffering major seizures indicative of traumatic brain injury, and was sent to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he stayed for forty-eight days. Afterwards, he was transferred to light duty with a burial detail at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and received a medical discharge in April 2004.

==After retirement==
After Baker revealed his story to a Kentucky reporter, a spokeswoman for United States Southern Command questioned the validity of his injuries, and denied that his medical discharge was related to the training drill. However, the Physical Evaluation Board stated in a document on 29 September 2003, that &quot;the TBI was due to soldier playing role of detainee who was non-cooperative and was being extracted from detention cell in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during a training exercise.&quot;

The Army has since recanted its denial of the relationship between Baker&#x27;s injury and the training drill, although the spokeswoman continues to claim that the injury was only partly caused by the incident. A military investigation concluded that there was no misconduct that led to Baker&#x27;s injury. A videotape that should have been made of the incident for training purposes has yet to be found.

A June 2005 BBC story reports Kentucky Congressman Ben Chandler &quot;urged the military to turn over Mr Baker&#x27;s medical records.&quot; The same month, the &quot;LA Times&quot; quoted an unnamed official: &quot;While it is unfortunate that Spc. Baker was injured, the standards of professionalism we expect of our soldiers mandate that our training be as realistic as possible&quot;.

As of June 2005 Baker receives $2,350 a month in military disability benefits, plus $1,000 a month in social security, which he was willing to give up if the Army finds a way to reinstate a position for him.

==Lawsuit==
Baker filed a lawsuit in May 2005, against Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of the Army Francis J. Harvey, and Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England, among others. Baker alleges the events in the incident violated his constitutional rights. In his suit Baker is asking for $15 million in compensation and damages, and for re-instatement in the Army. However, due to the 1950 Supreme Court decision in &quot;Feres v. United States&quot;, Baker is unable to sue.

Baker still &quot;wants to serve his country, in the Army&quot;, and has stated that the Army &quot;can find him a job that accommodates his disability&quot;.

<text>Sir Thomas Spencer Wells, 1st Baronet (3 February 181831 January 1897) was surgeon to Queen Victoria, a medical professor and president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.

==Early life==
He was born at St Albans, Hertfordshire and received his early education at St Albans School (then located in the Lady Chapel of the Abbey).

==Career==
After a short time as a pupil of a surgeon in Barnsley (Yorkshire), he studied medicine at Leeds, Trinity College Dublin, St Thomas&#x27; Hospital (becoming a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) in 1841 and a Fellow (FRCS) in 1844), and later in Paris, France.

He served as a naval surgeon in Malta, and then established his own ophthalmic surgery practice in London in 1853. In the same year he married Elizabeth Wright. In 1854, and from 1856 to 78, he was the surgeon of the Samaritan Free Hospital for Women, London (serving in between as an army surgeon in the Crimean War). He also lectured at the Grosvenor School of Medicine (which later became the medical school of St George&#x27;s Hospital). In 1877 was appointed Hunterian Professor of Surgery and Pathology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England (of which he was elected president in 1883, in the same year he was created baronet). From 1863 to 1896 he was surgeon to Queen Victoria&#x27;s household.

Wells specialized in obstetrics and ophthalmic surgery. He is recognized as a pioneer in abdominal surgery and is notable for having perfected ovariotomy. In 1879, his name was given to his invention of an improved pattern of artery forceps, which prevented entanglement of surrounding structures by the handles of the implement when in use. He was also one of the earliest surgeons to make use of anaesthetics in operations. He published a number of important medical books and articles.

Thomas Spencer Wells was elected member of Leopoldina in 1886.

==Later life==
He died after an attack of apoplexy on 31 January 1897 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery. His Hampstead estate was sold to the London County Council and turned into a park.

<text>Charles Joseph Van Depoele (27 April 1846 – 18 March 1892) was a Belgian-American electrical engineer, inventor, and pioneer in electric railway technology, including the first trolley pole.

==Biography==
===Early life in Belgium===
Van Depoele was born as Carolus Josephus Vandepoele in Lichtervelde, Province of West-Vlaanderen, Belgium, the son of Pieter-Joannes Vandepoele, a furniture maker from Ghent, and his wife, Marie-Theresia Algoet. Three months after his birth, the family moved to Bruges. At a young age, he dabbled in electricity, and became so thoroughly infatuated with the subject that he entered upon a course of study and experiment in Poperinghe. In 1861, while at college, he produced his first light with a battery of forty Bunsen cells. Later, he moved to Lille, France, where he attended regularly the lectures and experiments of the Imperial Lyceum from 1864 to 1869.

===Move to the US===
In 1869 he moved to the United States and took up his residence in Detroit, where he made a living by manufacturing furniture. He did not abandon his electrical pursuits, experimenting with electric lighting, electric generators and electric motors, and eventually forming the Van Depoele Electric Manufacturing Company.

===Electric railways===

As early as 1874, Van Depoele began investigations into the field of electric locomotion. Van Depoele&#x27;s first electric railway was laid in Chicago early in 1883, and he exhibited another at an exposition in that city later in the same year. In 1885, he invented and demonstrated the first trolley pole, a device used by electric streetcars (trams) to collect current from overhead wires, introducing it publicly on a line installed temporarily at the Toronto Industrial Exhibition in autumn 1885, reportedly reaching 65 mph. Fellow inventor Frank J. Sprague was studying similar ideas at the same time. Sprague improved the design and is sometimes credited as the trolley pole&#x27;s inventor.

Near the end of 1887, thirteen North American cities had electric railways in operation; nine of these systems were designed by Van Depoele, and used overhead lines to transmit electric current from an electrical generator to the electric locomotives on the rails.

===Electric lighting===
Van Depoele sold his electric motor business and related patents to the Thomson-Houston Electric Company in early 1888. He briefly thereafter devoted his efforts to his electric lighting business, until he sold that concern also to Thomson-Houston in mid-1889.

==Patents==
A prolific inventor, Van Depoele was granted at least 243 United States patents between 1881 and 1894 for various electric inventions including railway systems, lights, generators, motors, current regulators, pumps, telpher systems, batteries, hammers, rock drills, brakes, a gearless locomotive, a coal-mining machine, and a pile-driver.

==Recognition==
He received the most recognition for his role in the development of electric railways; George Herbert Stockbridge wrote in 1891, &quot;It is probably only just to Mr. Van Depoele to say that he is entitled to more credit than any other one man for the exploitation of electricity as a motive power.&quot;

==Death==
Van Depoele died on 18 March 1892 at the age of 45 in Lynn, Massachusetts, leaving a wife and several children.

<text>Amy Osborne Vanderbilt (July 22, 1908 – December 27, 1974) was an American authority on etiquette. In 1952 she published the best-selling book &quot;Amy Vanderbilt&#x27;s Complete Book of Etiquette&quot;. The book, later retitled &quot;Amy Vanderbilt&#x27;s Etiquette&quot;, has been updated and is still in circulation. Its longtime popularity has led to it being considered a standard of etiquette writing.

She is also the author or collector of cooking materials, including the 1961 book &quot;Amy Vanderbilt&#x27;s Complete Cook Book&quot; illustrated by Andy Warhol. This cookbook&#x27;s illustrations are attributed to &quot;Andrew Warhol&quot;, and predate Andy Warhol&#x27;s first New York solo pop art exhibition. His illustrations are simple line drawings in pen and ink.

==Biography==
Amy Vanderbilt claimed descent from Jan Aertson van der Bilt, who immigrated to the Dutch colony of New Netherland in 1650 and was also the ancestor of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, the 19th-century railroad magnate and millionaire, a distant cousin of Amy&#x27;s.

She was born in Staten Island, the daughter of Joseph Mortimer Vanderbilt, an insurance broker, and Mary Estelle Brooks Vanderbilt, and worked as a part-time reporter for the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; when she was 16 while attending Curtis High School. She was educated in Switzerland and at the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn before attending New York University. She worked in advertising and public relations, and published her book after five years of research. From 1954 to 1960, she hosted the television program &quot;It&#x27;s in Good Taste&quot; and from 1960 to 1962, she hosted the radio program &quot;The Right Thing to Do&quot;. She also worked as a consultant for several agencies and organizations, including the U.S. Department of State.

Vanderbilt was married four times and divorced three times. From 1929 to 1932, she was married to Robert S. Brinkerhoff. In 1935, she married Morton G. Clark. In 1945, she married Hans Knopf, a noted magazine photographer. In 1968, she married Curtis B. Kellar, a lawyer for Mobil Oil. Vanderbilt had three sons: Lincoln Gill Clark, Paul Vanderbilt Knopf, and Stephen John Knopf.

On December 27, 1974, she died from multiple fractures of the skull after falling or jumping from a second-floor window in her townhouse at 438 East 87th Street in New York. It remains unclear whether her fall was accidental (perhaps due to her hypertension medication, which friends and relatives said caused severe dizzy spells) or suicide. She was buried at the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York.

<doc id="751397" wikidata="Q2442506" url="?curid=751397" title="Tony Coelho">
<text>Anthony Lee Coelho (born June 15, 1942) is an American politician from California who served in the United States House of Representatives. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the primary sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act and is a former chairman and current member of the board of directors of the Epilepsy Foundation.

==Early life and education==
Coelho was born in rural Los Banos, California to parents of Portuguese descent. Coelho attended public schools in nearby Dos Palos, and grew up working on his family&#x27;s dairy farm. At age 16, Coelho was injured in a pickup truck accident, which doctors later suggested was the precipitating event for the onset of his epilepsy. For years after the accident, Coelho did not know he had the illness.

Coelho graduated with a B.A. from Loyola University of Los Angeles (now Loyola Marymount University) in 1964. At Loyola, he was initiated as a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and a member of the Crimson Circle, and later was elected Student Body President during his senior year.

After the Kennedy assassination, Coelho decided to become a priest. He went to a doctor for a medical exam, a prerequisite for entering the seminary. The doctor informed him that he had epilepsy. Because of canon law, he was unable to become a priest. Once his diagnosis was reported to the state, Coelho lost both his driver&#x27;s license and his health insurance.

==Career==
Coelho worked as a staff member for Congressman Bernie Sisk from 1965 until 1978. By 1970, Coelho was serving as Sisk&#x27;s administrative assistant. He enhanced his expertise in agriculture policy as staff director for the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Cotton. As staff coordinator for the House Rules Subcommittee on Broadcasting, on which Sisk served, Coelho helped develop the procedures that made possible the television coverage of the House proceedings via C-SPAN. When Sisk retired, Coelho ran for his seat and won.

During his first campaign for Congress, Coelho&#x27;s opponent asked how people would feel if Coelho went to a meeting at the White House and had a seizure. &quot;The press called me and the good Lord was with me&quot;, Coelho later related. &quot;Off the top of my head I said, &#x27;Well, in the 13 years I have served in Washington I knew a lot of people who went to the White House and had fits. At least I&#x27;d have an excuse.&quot;

===Congress===
In November 1978, Coelho was elected to the 96th Congress. He was later elected to the five succeeding Congresses where he served until his resignation on June 15, 1989. He served on the Agriculture, Interior, Veterans Affairs, and Administration Committees during his tenure. However he specialized in rights of disabled people.

Coehlo was involved and facilitated the savings and loan crisis. See &quot;Goliath&quot;, Matt Stoller, at 402 (2019). Specifically, he accepted donations from Drexler executives in order to defeat efforts to prevent the use of junk bonds in the purchase of companies by private equity firms. Id.
In 1980, Coelho was named chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a Hill committee that supports Democratic Party candidates. As the &quot;Washington Post&quot; observed, &quot;They made the sophomore congressman from central California, their chief House fund-raiser, a position not bestowed on such a junior member since it was given to a young Texas congressman named Lyndon B. Johnson in 1940.&quot; Coelho raised money from businesses, which later Ralph Nader would blame for changing the party.

As a member of the House leadership, Coelho helped lead the effort to pin the political blame for enactment of the Reagan economic program on the Republicans in the House. One Democratic campaign advertisement, airing early in the 1982 election season, featured scissors cutting a Social Security card and a voice accusing Republicans of trying to cut benefits.

In 1986, Coelho was elected House Majority Whip. As the chief vote counter for his party, Coelho oversaw a series of Democratic victories in the House on measures ranging from the budget to cutting off funds for the war in Central America.

In 1989, Coelho resigned from the House after six terms in the wake of press reports that he had received a loan from a savings and loan executive to purchase junk bonds. He was not charged with any crime.

While in the House, he was a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

Coelho was credited by congressional colleagues as the primary sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush. By 1994, four years after the law&#x27;s passage, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that some 800,000 more people with severe disabilities had found employment than had been employed when the ADA was first enacted.

===Later career===

Since his retirement from Congress, Coelho has pursued careers in business and public service, while remaining active in the disabilities community.

After leaving Congress, he joined investment firm Wertheim Schroder &amp; Company as a managing director.

From 1990 to 1995, he also served as president and CEO of Wertheim Schroder Investment Services, which grew from $400 million to $4 billion in managed investments under his management.

In 1995, Coelho formed ETC w/tci, an education and training technology company in Washington, D.C.. He was the chairman and chief executive officer until 1997.

President Bill Clinton appointed Coelho to serve as chairman of the President&#x27;s Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities, a position he held from 1994 to 2001; he also served as Vice Chair of the National Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities. In 1998, Clinton appointed Coelho as the United States Commissioner General at the 1998 World Expo in Portugal. Clinton also appointed Coelho as co-chair to the U.S. Census Monitoring Board, a position he held until his appointment as general chairman of the Gore Presidential campaign.

In the summer of 1994, Coelho was the principal Democratic political strategist during the run-up to the mid-term Congressional elections. Officially, he was Senior Advisor to the Democratic National Committee. The Republican Party won a landslide victory in the fall congressional elections, capturing both the House and Senate by commanding margins.

On November 29, 1994, then-Speaker of the House Tom Foley appointed Coelho as one of 17 members of the Aspin–Brown Commission. Congress created the commission to study what intelligence agencies should do after the Cold War, and was charged with preparing a report of its findings and recommendations to the President and the Congress.

In 1999, Coelho was made chairman of Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s presidential campaign. During his tenure, Coelho moved the campaign headquarters from Washington, D.C. to Nashville. He oversaw an overhaul of the campaign&#x27;s message and strategy, and changed personnel and consultants. Gore prevailed over former Senator Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries of 2000 in every primary and caucus contest and received the Democratic nomination to be president.

Before the 2000 Democratic National Convention, Coelho became ill and resigned his position as general campaign chairman. Doctors later found and removed a tumor on the left side of his brain. He was replaced by former Commerce Secretary William M. Daley. He participates annually at New York Law School with its Tony Coelho Lecture in Disability Employment Law &amp; Policy. He has endowed a chair in public policy at the University of California in Merced. He is the chairman of the board of directors of the Epilepsy Foundation. He partnered with NBCUniversal and the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) to create the &quot;NBCUniversal Tony Coelho Media Scholarship&quot;, which encourages people with disabilities to pursue media-related degrees and careers. He is a former chairman and current member of the board of directors of the American Association of People With Disabilities. He also sits on the Council on American Politics, the advisory board of George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management. Coelho served as an advisor of ZeniMax Media as well. Coelho serves as a founding partner of Vectis Strategies, a national public affairs firm.

Coelho was one of the recipients of the inaugural Henry Viscardi Achievement Awards in 2013.

In 2015, the National Disability Mentoring Coalition named Coelho an inaugural inductee to Susan M. Daniels Disability Mentoring Hall of Fame for his commitment to mentoring and improving the lives of people with disabilities.

Coelho was named a vice-chair of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

<doc id="751403" wikidata="Q3079246" url="?curid=751403" title="Western European broadleaf forests">
<text>The Western European broadleaf forests is an ecoregion in Western Europe, and parts of the Alps. It comprises temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, that cover large areas of France, Germany and the Czech Republic and more moderately sized parts of Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and South Limburg (Netherlands). Luxembourg is also part of this ecoregion.

==Geography==
The Western European broadleaf forests ecoregion covers an area of , including the Massif Central, Central German Uplands, Jura Mountains, Bavarian Plateau, and Bohemian Massif.

This area has been inhabited for thousands of years and holds several large cities such as Lyon, Nancy and Munich. Most of the countryside has been cleared for agricultural land, cultivated with cereals (corn, wheat, oats), and to a smaller extent grapes. The ecoregion hosts a good variety of animal species, birds in particular, but most large mammals are in decline.

== Forests ==
The forest habitats of the ecoregion comprise mainly lowland and alti-montane mixed beech forests. There is also some natural beech woods, and the region also includes small parts of sub-Mediterranean forest habitats. The dominant trees in this forest are &quot;Quercus robur&quot;, &quot;Quercus petraea&quot;, &quot;Picea abies&quot;, &quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;, &quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;, &quot;Taxus baccata&quot;, &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;, &quot;Malus sylvestris&quot;, &quot;Viburnum lantana&quot;, &quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;, &quot;Tilia cordata&quot;, &quot;Aesculus hippocastanum&quot;, &quot;Rhamnus cathartica&quot;, &quot;Ulmus glabra&quot;, &quot;Ulmus minor&quot;, &quot;Populus alba&quot;, &quot;Salix alba&quot;, &quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;, &quot;Betula pendula&quot;, &quot;Populus tremula&quot;, &quot;Populus nigra&quot;, &quot;Juglans regia&quot;, &quot;Juniperus communis&quot;, &quot;Prunus padus&quot; and &quot;Corylus avellana&quot;

== Fauna ==

== Status and conservation ==
Most of the original forest of the ecoregion has been cleared in the last 200 years, but a few larger patches remain, typically in non-arable montane areas that are part of national parks or protections. The woodlands of the ecoregion is generally second-growth and heavily fragmented.

National parks and larger nature protections in the ecoregion includes:



Luxembourg maintains the Upper Sûre Natural Park, but this park covers mostly the Upper Sûre Lake, an artificial dam created in 1959, and no land area of significance. The lake is an important bird area. Luxembourg also holds part of the cross-border German-Luxembourg Nature Park in addition to several smaller nature reservations. Here eco-typical patches of forest are growing.

Austria does not have any protections in this ecoregion.

<text>Pieter Wilhelm Adrianus Cort van der Linden (14 May 1846 – 15 July 1935) was a Dutch politician who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from August 1913 to September 1918.

==Biography==
He was the last prime minister to lead a liberal cabinet and the last liberal to be Prime Minister until Mark Rutte in 2010 (92 years later). One of Cort van der Linden&#x27;s major achievements was maintaining Dutch neutrality during World War I although personally, he was pro-German.

He also introduced universal suffrage in the Netherlands in what is now known as the Pacification of 1917. That made the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party and the General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses win the 1918 elections. The Catholic Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck took Cort van der Linden&#x27;s place as Prime Minister.

<text>The Colorado River Aqueduct, or CRA, is a water conveyance in Southern California in the United States, operated by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The aqueduct impounds water from the Colorado River at Lake Havasu on the California–Arizona border, west across the Mojave and Colorado deserts to the east side of the Santa Ana Mountains. It is one of the primary sources of drinking water for Southern California.

Originally conceived by William Mulholland and designed by Chief Engineer Frank E. Weymouth of the MWD, it was the largest public works project in southern California during the Great Depression. The project employed 30,000 people over an eight-year period and as many as 10,000 at one time.

The system is composed of two reservoirs, five pumping stations, of canals, of tunnels, and of buried conduit and siphons. Average annual throughput is .

==Route==
The Colorado River Aqueduct begins near Parker Dam on the Colorado River. There, the water is pumped up the Whipple Mountains where the water emerges and begins flowing through of siphons and open canals on the southern Mojave Desert. At Iron Mountain, the water is again lifted, . The aqueduct then turns southwest towards the Eagle Mountains. There the water is lifted two more times, first by to an elevation of more than , then by to an elevation of above sea level. The CRA then runs through the deserts of the Coachella Valley and through the San Gorgonio Pass. Near Cabazon, the aqueduct begins to run underground until it enters the San Jacinto Tunnel at the base of the San Jacinto Mountains. On the other side of the mountains the aqueduct continues to run underground until it reaches the terminus at Lake Mathews. From there, of distribution lines, along with eight more tunnels, delivers water to member cities. Some of the water is siphoned off in San Jacinto via the San Diego canal, part of the San Diego Aqueduct that delivers water to San Diego County.

==Background and construction==
As the Los Angeles metropolitan area grew in the early 1900s, Mulholland and others began looking for new sources of water. Eventually, Los Angeles laid claim to the waters of the Owens Valley, east of the Sierra Nevada, and in 1913 completed the Los Angeles Aqueduct to deliver its waters to the burgeoning city. By the early 1920s, Los Angeles had grown so rapidly that the Owens River watershed could no longer supply the city&#x27;s needs for domestic and agricultural water. By 1923, Mulholland and his engineers were looking east to an even larger water supply, the Colorado River. The plan was to dam the Colorado River and carry its waters across hundreds of miles of mountains and deserts. In 1924, the first steps were taken to create a metropolitan water district, made up of various cities throughout southern California. The Metropolitan Water District (&quot;Met&quot;) was incorporated on December 6, 1928, and in 1929 took over where Los Angeles had left off, planning for a Colorado River aqueduct. (During the same period, as a hedge against the possible abandonment of the planned Colorado River aqueduct, Los Angeles also undertook an extension of the Los Angeles Aqueduct to the Mono Lake Basin.)

The MWD considered eight routes for the aqueduct. In 1931, the MWD board of directors chose the Parker route which would require the building of the Parker Dam. The Parker route was chosen because it was seen as the safest and most economical. A $220 million bond was approved on September 29, 1931. Work began in January 1933 near Thousand Palms, and in 1934 the United States Bureau of Reclamation began work on the Parker Dam. Construction of the aqueduct was finished in 1935. Water first flowed in the aqueduct on January 7, 1939.

The CRA contributed to urban growth in the south coast region. Although the CRA brought &quot;too much, too expensive&quot; water in its early years of operation, subsidies (via property taxes) and expansion of MWD&#x27;s service area brought reduced prices and expanded demand. (Holding supply constant, that meant that the quantity demanded rose to meet supplies.) On subsidies and sprawl, note that it was not until 1954 that Met&#x27;s revenue from selling water exceed the cost of delivering it; it was not until 1973 that revenue from sales exceeded revenue from taxes. Since about 80 percent of Met&#x27;s costs are fixed, revenue needs to cover far more than operating expenses in order to pay for all costs.

In 1955, the aqueduct was recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) as one of their &quot;Seven Modern Civil Engineering Wonders&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The Colorado River Aqueduct was featured by Huell Howser in &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot;.

<text>John Vanderlyn (October 18, 1775September 23, 1852) was an American neoclassicist painter.

==Biography==

Vanderlyn was born at Kingston, New York, and was the grandson of colonial portrait painter Pieter Vanderlyn. He was employed by a print-seller in New York, and was first instructed in art by Archibald Robinson (1765–1835), a Scotsman who was afterwards one of the directors of the American Academy of the Fine Arts. He went to Philadelphia, where he spent time in the studio of Gilbert Stuart and copied some of Stuart&#x27;s portraits, including one of Aaron Burr, who placed him under Gilbert Stuart as a pupil.

He was a protégé of Aaron Burr who in 1796 sent Vanderlyn to Paris, where he studied for five years. He returned to the United States in 1801 and lived in the home of Burr, then the Vice President, where he painted the well-known portraits of Burr and his daughter. In 1802 he painted two views of Niagara Falls, which were engraved and published in London in 1804. He returned to Paris in 1803, also visiting England in 1805, where he painted the &quot;Death of Jane McCrea&quot; for Joel Barlow. Vanderlyn then went to Rome, where he painted his picture of &quot;Marius amid the Ruins of Carthage&quot;, which was shown in Paris, and obtained the Napoleon gold medal there. This success caused him to remain in Paris for seven years, during which time he prospered greatly. In 1812 he showed a nude &quot;Ariadne&quot; (engraved by Durand, and now in the Pennsylvania Academy), which increased his fame. When Aaron Burr fled to Paris, Vanderlyn was for a time his only support.

Vanderlyn returned to the United States in 1815, and painted portraits of various eminent men, including James Monroe, John C. Calhoun, Governor Joseph C. Yates, Governor George Clinton, James Madison, Robert R Livingston (New York Historical Society), Andrew Jackson, and Zachary Taylor. In 1834, he completed a posthumous full-length portrait of George Washington for the U.S. House of Representatives, based on Gilbert Stuart&#x27;s 1796 Lansdowne portrait.
He also exhibited panoramas and built The Rotunda in New York City, which displayed panoramas of Paris, Athens, Mexico, Versailles (by himself), and some battle-pieces; but neither his portraits nor the panoramas brought him financial success, partly because he worked very slowly.
In 1825 Vanderlyn was one of the founders of the National Academy of Design, and taught at its school.
In 1842, through friendly influences, he was commissioned by Congress to paint &quot;The Landing of Columbus&quot; for the Rotunda of the United States Capitol. Going to Paris, he hired a French artist, who, it is said, did most of the work. It was engraved for the United States five-dollar banknotes. This painting was later reproduced in an engraving used on the Columbian 2c Postage Issue of 1893.

Vanderlyn was the first American to study in France instead of in England, and to acquire accurate draughtsmanship. He was more academic than his fellows; but, though faithfully and capably executed, it was thought that his work was rather devoid of charm, according to the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. His &quot;Landing of Columbus&quot; has been called by &quot;Appleton&#x27;s Cyclopedia&quot; &quot;hardly more than respectable.&quot;
He died in poverty at Kingston, New York, on September 23, 1852. He is buried in Wiltwyck Rural Cemetery in Kingston, NY.

<text>Simon van der Meer (24 November 19254 March 2011) was a Dutch particle accelerator physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1984 with Carlo Rubbia for contributions to the CERN project which led to the discovery of the W and Z particles, the two fundamental communicators of the weak interaction.

==Biography==
One of four children, Simon van der Meer was born and grew up in The Hague, the Netherlands, in a family of teachers. He was educated at the city&#x27;s gymnasium, graduating in 1943 during the German occupation of the Netherlands. He studied Technical Physics at the Delft University of Technology, and received an engineer&#x27;s degree in 1952. After working for Philips Research in Eindhoven on high-voltage equipment for electron microscopy for a few years, he joined CERN in 1956 where he stayed until his retirement in 1990.

Van der Meer was a relative of Nobel Prize winner Tjalling Koopmans – they were first cousins once removed. In the mid-1960s, Van der Meer married Catharina M. Koopman; they had a daughter and a son.

==Work at CERN==
In the 1950s, Van der Meer designed magnets for the 28 GeV Proton Synchrotron (PS) In 1961, he invented a pulsed focusing device, known as the ‘Van der Meer horn’. Such devices are necessary for long-base-line neutrino facilities and are used even today.

That was followed in the 1960s by the design of a small storage ring for a physics experiment studying the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Soon after and in the following decade, Van der Meer did some very innovative work on the regulation and control of power supplies for the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) and, later, the SPS.

Van der Meer&#x27;s ISR Collider days in the 1970s led to his technique for luminosity calibration of colliding beams, first used at the ISR and still used today at the LHC, as well as in other colliders.

The Nobel Prize committee recognised Van der Meer&#x27;s idea of stochastic cooling and its application at CERN in the late 1970s and 1980s, specifically in the Antiproton Accumulator, which supplied antiprotons to the Proton-Antiproton Collider.

During his work at the ISR, Van der Meer developed a technique using steering magnets to vertically displace the two colliding beams with respect to each other; this permitted the evaluation of the effective beam height, leading to an evaluation of the beam luminosity at an intersection point. The famous ‘Van der Meer scans’ are indispensable even today in the LHC experiments; without these, the precision of the calibration of the luminosity at the intersection points in the Collider would be much lower .

For the new SPS machine constructed in the early seventies, he proposed that the generation of the reference voltages for the bending and quadrupole supplies should be based on measurements of the field along the cycle, and gave an outline of the correction algorithms. His proposal resulted in the first ever computer-controlled closed-loop system for a geographically distributed system, as the 7 km circumference SPS was; this was a no simple feat for the early 1970s. Measurements of the main magnet currents were introduced only later, when the SPS had to run as a storage ring for the SPS p–pbar collider.

Van der Meer&#x27;s accelerator knowledge and computer programming meant he developed very sophisticated applications and tools to control the antiproton source accelerators as well as the transfer of antiprotons to the SPS Collider for Nobel-winning discoveries. The AA and AC pbar source complex machines remained from 1987 to 1996 the most highly automated set of machines in CERN&#x27;s repertoire of accelerators.

==Nobel prize==
Van der Meer invented the technique of stochastic cooling of particle beams. His technique was used to accumulate intense beams of antiprotons for head-on collision with counter-rotating proton beams at 540 GeV centre-of-mass energy or 270 GeV per beam in the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN. Such collisions produced W and Z bosons which could be detected for the first time in 1983 by the UA1 experiment, led by Carlo Rubbia. The W and Z bosons had been theoretically predicted some years earlier, and their experimental discovery was considered a significant success for CERN. Van der Meer and Rubbia shared the 1984 Nobel Prize for their decisive contributions to the project.

Van der Meer and Ernest Lawrence are the only two accelerator physicists who have won the Nobel prize.

Apart from his Nobel Prize, Van der Meer also became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984.

<text>The Parker Pen Company is an American manufacturer of luxury writing pens, founded in 1888 by George Safford Parker in Janesville, Wisconsin, United States. In 2011 the Parker factory at Newhaven, East Sussex, England, was closed, and its production transferred to Nantes, France.

==History==
George Safford Parker, the founder, had previously been a sales agent for the John Holland Gold Pen Company. He received his first fountain pen related patent in 1889. In 1894, Parker received a patent on his &quot;Lucky Curve&quot; fountain pen feed, which was claimed to draw excess ink back into the pen barrel when the pen was not in use. The company&#x27;s first successful pen, released in 1899, was the Parker Jointless. The Lucky Curve feed was used in various forms until 1928.
From the 1920s to the 1960s, before the development of the ballpoint pen, Parker was either number one or number two in worldwide writing instrument sales. In 1931, Parker created Quink (quick drying ink), which eliminated the need for blotting. In 1941, the company developed the most widely used fountain pen model in history, the Parker 51, which led to over $400 million in sales during its 30-year history. Manufacturing facilities were set up over the years in Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Mexico, USA, Pakistan, India, Germany (Osmia-Parker), Brazil and Argentina.

In 1954, Parker released the Parker Jotter ballpoint pen with its original nylon body and inverted &quot;V&quot; clip. The Jotter would go on to sell over 750 million units during its history. In 1955, the company introduced its Liquid Lead pencil, which used liquid graphite to write like a pen. However, the Scripto company had introduced a similar product called Fluidlead a few months prior. To avoid a costly patent fight, the companies agreed to share their formulas with each other.

The company bought retailer and catalog company Norm Thompson in 1973, and then sold it in 1981. In 1976 Parker acquired Manpower just as the temporary staffing market was surging. In time Manpower provided more revenue than the pen business. A 1982 spinoff, Sintered Specialties, Inc., became SSI Technologies, a manufacturer of automotive sensors.

A management buyout in 1986 moved the company&#x27;s headquarters to Newhaven, East Sussex, England, which was the original location of the Valentine Pen Company previously acquired by Parker. In 1993 Parker was purchased by the Gillette Company, which already owned the Paper Mate brand – the best-selling disposable ballpoint. In 2000 Gillette sold its writing instruments division to the company Newell Rubbermaid, whose Sanford Stationery Division became the largest writing instrument manufacturers in the world at that time, simultaneously owning such brand names as Rotring, Sharpie, Reynolds as well as Parker, PaperMate, Waterman, and Liquid Paper.

After Parker&#x27;s unique design patent for its Jotter classic metal ink refill cartridge expired, low cost generic copies produced in China led to increased commercial competition. Parker&#x27;s sales began to see drastic adverse effects as a result. In July 2009 &quot;Newell Rubbermaid Inc.&quot; in response announced that it had decided to close down the Parker production factory at Newhaven in England, with the dismissal of 180 employees from the facility, and relocate production to France. The following month, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. announced that the factory in Janesville, Wisconsin, was also to close the remaining operation there producing Parker Pens (which eliminated a further 153 manufacturing jobs). The company press release stated: &quot;This decision is a response to structural issues accelerated by market trends and is in no way a reflection on the highly valued work performed by our Janesville employees over the years.&quot; Newell Rubbermaid offered &#x27;transitional employment services&#x27; along with severance pay in compensation to the dismissed workforce.

Subsequently, Parker has abandoned its traditional retail outlets in North America. While some of its former staple Jotter pens may be found in retailers such as Office Depot, the Parker line has been moved to upscale &quot;luxury&quot; retailers in an abandonment of its former business model of quality manufacture combined with mass market appeal and pricing. With this commercial strategic move Parker also altered its traditional product warranty on its high end pens, changing the former lifetime guarantee to a two-year warranty limitation.

Parker Pen Co. was an aviation pioneer. The interest of Parker Pen Co. in aircraft came from Kenneth Parker, son of the founder; he enlisted in the fledgling air service and, after flight training at Miami Air Base, he was assigned to officer training in tactical maneuvers at Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida. From their first company business plane, the Parker Duofold Fairchild, they used it as an innovative advertising weapon inviting his dealers. Between the 1920s and 1960s, Parker maintained a considerable air fleet.

=== Parker 25 ===
The Parker 25 was a pen introduced by the Parker Pen Company in 1975. Created by the designer Kenneth Grange based on a detailed brief, it was manufactured in Newhaven, England and produced in a variety of different versions until 1999. An eye-catching, contemporary-looking pen, with mainly steel components, the Parker 25 was intended to revive the company&#x27;s fortunes. As &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &#x27;(Grange&#x27;s) classic Parker pen had the machined lustre of a bullet. In fact, its tapering barrel was inspired by an American space rocket, a form that enabled the lid to be the same diameter as the pen no matter which end it was attached to.&#x27; It was affordable enough to become a staple entry-level pen for both work and leisure uses – and for secondary school students at a time when fountain pens were still obligatory in many British schools. Advertising slogans used to market Parker 25s included &#x27;Modern as Tomorrow&#x27;, &#x27;Space Age Design, Space Age Performance&#x27;, &#x27;European Styled&#x27; and &#x27;Contemporary, Highly Functional Design&#x27;.
Parker 25s were issued in several variants: initially, fountain pen, ballpoint, fibre point and mechanical pencil. A rollerball model was introduced in 1981, and fibre tips were phased out a couple of years later. While the great majority of Parker 25s were &#x27;flighters&#x27;, with a brushed steel finish, matte black and later white versions were issued between 1978 and 1987. The pens had four different trim colours – blue (the most common), black, green, and most rarely of all, orange. Orange trim Parker 25s were discontinued in 1976 following a copyright dispute with Rotring, and surviving examples are very sought after. A striking feature of all Parker 25s is the square plastic tassie logo on the clip.

The earliest Mark I Parker 25 fountain pens dating from the first year of production feature a distinctive breather hole in the nib. While the original models had a flat plastic circle on top of the cap, Mark III and IV pens have a round ridge on this inner cap. Pens manufactured from 1980 feature letter date codes which were changed every quarter. Those manufactured from 1990 are stamped &#x27;Made in UK&#x27;; earlier pens were inscribed &#x27;Made in England&#x27;. Pens without any manufacture stamps, or inscribed &#x27;Made in Aust&#x27;, are very rare. Parker 25s were all assembled in Britain by hand – unlike Jotters, Vectors and other mass market pens – and were very minimalist, comprising between 9 and 11 components.

The 25 was an extremely successful pen for Parker commercially, especially during its first decade or so of production. A number of promotional versions were made up to order, featuring company logos on the barrel (the matte black and white versions were often branded in this way), clip or cap.

Some pen fans are rather disparaging about the Parker 25, which lacks the status of the legendary Parker Duofold or the storied Parker 51. But in recent years they have been enjoying a revival, their space age look evoking nostalgia for the final quarter of the twentieth century. The Parker 25 was even given the accolade of an exhibition stand at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

===Parker Vector===

The precursor to the Parker Vector was introduced in 1981. It was a simple cylindrical plastic cap and barrel roller-ball pen called the &quot;Parker RB1&quot;. In 1984, Parker added the FP1 (&quot;Fountain Pen 1&quot;), with essentially the same design. The RB1 and FP1 models were produced until 1986, at which time Parker revised the pen by lengthening the cap and shortening the barrel and renaming the new pen the &quot;Vector Standard&quot;. Presently, there are four models available (in plastic and steel): the fountain pen, capped rollerball, pushbutton ballpoint, and pushbutton pencil.

== US Presidential Parkers ==

Parker Jotters were a favorite choice of President John F. Kennedy for signing legislation and to give as gifts. Indeed, successive presidents from Kennedy to Clinton used Parker pens for these purposes, and Parker retained a special representative, John W. Gibbs, to handle White House orders. In one of his early years in office, Lyndon Johnson ordered no less than 60,000 Parker pens. LBJ would use up to 75 pens to sign each important document and bill, writing different strokes of the letters of his name with different pens, and giving them all away to allies and supporters with little typed certificates. After Parker ceased to be an American-owned company, later presidents switched to using A. T. Cross Company pens.

<text>James Oliver Van de Velde, SJ (April 3, 1795 – November 13, 1855) was a Belgian-born Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Natchez from 1853 to his death in 1855. He was a member of the Jesuits.

Van de Velde previously served as Bishop of Chicago from 1849 and 1853. Prior to that, he was a provincial and vice provincial of the Society of Jesus from 1843 to 1849 and president of Saint Louis University from 1840 to 1843. 

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
John Andrew James Oliver Benedict Rottheir Van de Velde was born on April 3, 1795, to a wealthy Catholic family in Lebbeke in the Austrian Netherlands (a Flemish town in present-day Belgium). He was tutored at an early age by a French priest living in the Van de Velde household, a refugee from the French Revolution. In 1810, at age 10, Van de Velde was sent to a boarding school in Ghent. He excelled academically and by age 18 was teaching French and Flemish to the younger students.

During the early 1800s, the Austrian Netherlands had fallen under the rule of the Napoleonic regime in France. However, by 1815 Napoleon had been defeated; Catholic Belgium was joined with Protestant Holland in the independent United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This put the Catholic subjects under the rule of William of Orange, who was antagonistic toward them. As a result, Van de Velde had been planning to emigrate to England or Italy to continue his studies. He started learning English and Italian.

However, the head of the Major Seminary of Mechelen at Mechelen in the kingdom persuaded Van de Velde to stay in Belgium and teach Latin, French, and Flemish at the seminary while studying religion. Van Velde was eventually able to also preach and write in English, German, Italian, and Spanish.

=== Education ===

In 1815, Van de Velde entered the seminary at Mechelen. While teaching there, he met Reverend Charles Nerinckx. The priest was trying raise funds and recruit other priests for his struggling missions in the United States. He persuaded Van de Velde to accompany him there to finish his studies for the priesthood.

On May 16, 1817, Van de Velde sailed for Baltimore, Maryland, on the brig &quot;Mars.&quot; He experienced seasickness throughout the voyage and one of his blood vessels ruptured after he fell during a violent storm. When the ship reached Baltimore, the original plan was for Van de Velde to travel overland to Bardstown, Kentucky, to enter St. Thomas Seminary. However, after losing a large amount of blood due to his injury, Van de Velde was too weak to make the trip. He was transported to St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary in Baltimore, which allowed him to recuperate there. 

In 1818, as an alternative to St. Thomas Seminary, Nerinckx advised Van de Velde to enter the Jesuit novitiate at Georgetown College in Washington, D.C. After completing the novitiate in 1819, he stayed at Georgetown to continue his academic and theological studies for eight more years.

When Van de Velde entered the novitiate, he became the librarian for Georgetown College. When he started, the new library contained about 200 books. By 1831, when Van de Velde left Georgetown, it had 20,000 books. 

While at the Seminary of Mechelen, Van de Velde had mentored a seminarian named Judocus Francis Van Assche. In 1820, Van Velde wrote a letter to Van Assche, urging him to completed his studies for the priesthood in the United States. Nerinckx delivered the letter to Van Assche during a fundraising trip to Europe. Van Assche decided to go and recruited eight other seminarians to accompany him. 

Van Assche and his friends arrived in Washington in September 1821 and then entered the Jesuit seminary in White Marsh, Maryland, in October 1821. This group of Belgians would later become the core of the Jesuit mission effort in Missouri. The one letter written by Van de Velde brought nine men into the priesthood.

== Priesthood ==

Van de Velde was ordained into the priesthood in Baltimore for the Jesuit Order on September 25, 1827, by Archbishop Ambrose Maréchal. After his ordination, Van de Velde remained at Georgetown to complete his education. The Jesuits also assigned him to serve as chaplain at the Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, a school for Catholic girls. In 1829, he was named pastor of the mission churches in Rockville and Rock Creek in Maryland.

In 1831, the Jesuits sent Van de Velde to St. Louis, Missouri, to join the faculty at St. Louis College, their new institution of higher learning. While a professor there, he taught rhetoric and mathematics. When St. Louis College became a university in 1833, Van de Velde was named as its vice president. Van de Velde took his final vows as a Jesuit in 1837, and in 1840 became president of the university. During his tenure, he built a new building for the novitiate and improved the academic programs.

Van de Velde left the presidency of Saint Louis University in 1843 to serve as vice-provincial of the Jesuits. While serving in this post, he erected several churches and started mission churches among Native American tribes. He would later become the provincial. 

== Bishop of Chicago ==
Van de Velde was appointed bishop of Chicago on October 3, 1848 by Pope Pius IX. Van de Velde was consecrated on February 11, 1849, in the Church of St. Francis Xavier at Saint Louis University by Archbishop Peter Kenrick. 

At that time, the Diocese of Chicago included the entire State of Illinois. After his consecration, Van de Velde traveled from St. Louis to Chicago, celebrating mass in Cahokia, Kaskaskia, and Quincy along the way. He preached in English, German, and French. Van de Velde also tried to visit locations in the diocese that had historical meaning for the Jesuit Order and the Catholic Church.

During his first trip in Illinois, Van de Velde encounter many Catholic orphans. He brought 75 of them back to Chicago. Using his own money, along with contributions from Catholics and Protestants, he placed them in orphanages.

The Catholic population in Illinois consisted primarily of poor immigrants served by very few priests. When Van Velde visited the German Catholics in Springfield, he learned that some of them had been unable to see a priest for four years. To minister to these Catholics outside of Chicago, Van de Velde spent many weeks traveling across the state. He would go by&quot;river packet, stage, carriage, &#x27;mud-wagon&#x27;, and towards the end, occasionally by railroad&quot;. He was sometimes forced to travel by horse and camp on the roadside. These trips, along with the tough winter climate, worsened Van de Velde&#x27;s rheumatism and other health problems.

In 1849, a cholera epidemic swept through Chicago, leaving many children as orphans. That same year, Van de Veldt founded the Catholic Orphan Asylum to take care of the Catholic orphans. The Protestant leaders of the city had opened a separate orphanage that same year for Protestant children.

=== Baltimore Conference ===

In May 1852, Van de Velde arrived in Baltimore for the first plenary council, a meeting of all the bishops in the United States to discuss policies and rules for the American church. At the start of the council, Van de Velde told his fellow bishops that he was going to Rome after the meeting to seek permission from the pope to resign as bishop of Chicago. He said that his health prevented him from continuing the job. He had previously requested resignation by letter in Chicago, but had been refused. 

In response, the bishops decided that the Vatican should separated Southern Illinois from the Diocese of Chicago into a new Diocese of Quincy. However, Van de Velde insisted that he still wanted to resign. When the council ended that spring, Van Velde brought all of their proposed decrees to Rome. 

Arriving in Rome in June 1852, Van de Velde met twice with Pope Pius IX and reiterated his health problems. Van de Velde wanted to simply return to his former life as a Jesuit academic, but the pope said no. However, Pius IX agreed to transfer him at a later date to an American diocese in a warmer climate. Van de Velde then visited Belgium, France and Germany before sailing from Liverpool, England, for New York City in November 1852. He was soon back in Chicago. 

Soon after his return to Chicago, Van de Velde fell ill. He was forced to spend ten days recuperating in Indiana at the monastery of the Fathers of the Holy Cross at the University of Notre Dame du Lac (now Notre Dame University).

During his tenure in Illinois, Van de Velde started 70 churches, contributing his own funds to many of them. He personally confirmed 3,600 Catholics. When the Vatican announced its 1853 decision to create the Diocese of Quincy in Southern Illinois, Van de Velde purchased a piece of property there for its new cathedral.

== Bishop of Natchez ==
On July 29, 1853, Pius IX appointed Van de Velde as bishop of Natchez. He arrived in Natchez, Mississippi, in November 1853 and was installed in December. At that time, the diocese had nine priests, 11 churches and one orphanage covering the entire State of Mississippi. As he had done in Illinois, Van de Velde immediately started traveling throughout the diocese visiting Catholic communities. 

Van de Velde founded two schools in Natchez and purchased a property for a college. He began acquiring land for the construction of new churches and started repairing existing churches. He directed workers to gather exposed bones at the old Spanish cemetery and re-inter them a crypt under St. Mary Cathedral. 

== Death and legacy ==
On October 23, 1855, Van de Velde slipped on the front steps of his residence and fractured his leg in two places. He soon developed an infection in his leg. During this period, Natchez was in the middle of a yellow fever epidemic and Van de Velde soon contracted the disease. Over the next three weeks, his condition deteriorated. Before his death, Van de Velde made a final confession and was administered the last rites.

Van de Velde died on November 13, 1855, after five final hours of paroxysms and sliding in and out of consciousness. He was 60 years old. His body was dressed in vestments with his eyes partially open and his casket displayed on a tilt, &quot;so as to give the impression of being partially erect&quot;, according to a letter by a Jesuit priest. He was buried on November 14, after a funeral mass celebrated at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral by Archbishop Anthony Blanc.

<doc id="751431" wikidata="Q2963133" url="?curid=751431" title="River Chew">
<text>The River Chew is a small river in England that flows for some through the North Somerset countryside to form the Chew Valley before merging with the River Avon.

The spring from which the Chew rises is just upstream from Chewton Mendip. Strode Brook and Winford Brook are the main tributaries, both joining the Chew from the left. The river flows northwest from Chewton Mendip through Litton, Chew Valley Lake, Chew Stoke, Chew Magna, and Stanton Drew. The river passes under the A37 at Pensford; flows through the villages of Publow, Woollard, Compton Dando, and Chewton Keynsham; and joins the River Avon at Keynsham. The Two Rivers Way runs alongside the Chew for much of its distance, forming part of the Monarch&#x27;s Way.

==The name &quot;Chew&quot;==

The name &quot;Chew&quot; may have Celtic origins, cognate with the River Chwefru, &quot;cliwyf-ffrenwy&quot;, &quot;the moving, gushing water&quot;; ancient forms are &quot;Estoca&quot; (Chew Stoke), &quot;Chiu&quot; (Chew Magna), and &quot;Ciwetune&quot; (Chewton Mendip). Its exact meaning admits of several possible explanations, including &quot;winding water&quot;, the &quot;ew&quot; being a variant of the French &quot;eau&quot;, &quot;water&quot;. The word &quot;chewer&quot; is western dialect for &quot;narrow passage&quot; and &quot;chare&quot; is Old English for &quot;turning.&quot;

Another theory is that the name derives from the Welsh &quot;cyw&quot;, &quot;the young of an animal, or chicken&quot;, such that &quot;Afon Cyw&quot; would have meant &quot;the river of the chickens&quot;.

Other possible explanations are it comes from the Old English word &quot;cēo&quot; (&quot;fish gill&quot;), used in the transferred sense of a ravine, in a similar way to Old Norse &quot;gil&quot;, or possibly a derogatory nickname from Middle English &quot;chowe&quot;, &quot;chough&quot;, Old English &quot;cēo&quot;, a bird closely related to the crow and the jackdaw, notorious for its chattering and thieving. Still another suggestion is that the river is named after the Viking war god Tiw.

==Course==

The current course of the river was likely established after the last ice age, before which the river had probably followed the course of the Congresbury Yeo to the Bristol Channel. Ice blocking the Bristol Channel would have diverted the Chew such that it flowed north rather than west through Compton Martin to join the Avon.

==Roman use==

&quot;Pigs&quot; (ingots) of lead from the Charterhouse Roman Town on Mendip were brought to the river to be transported to Sea Mills on the Avon for shipment overseas.

==Flood of 1968==

The Chew Stoke flood of 1968 caused serious damage to towns and villages along its path, sweeping away the bridge at Pensford.

==Fishing==

Fish ladders have been installed at three weirs in Keynsham and Chewton Keynsham to allow fish to travel upstream. Fishing rights for the Millground and Chewton sections of the river are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six left-bank fields (looking downstream) from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill, Keynsham. The water is home to numerous species of fish, including chub, roach, European perch, rudd, gudgeon, dace, grayling, trout, and eel.

<text>David Edward Bonior (born June 6, 1945) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. First elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1976, Bonior served as Democratic whip in the House from 1991 to 2002, during which time Democrats were in both the majority (1991–1995) and minority (1995–2002), making Bonior the third and second highest-ranking Democrat in the House, respectively.

During his tenure in office, Bonior was the public face of Democratic opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and was known for his tenacity in opposing Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, against whom Bonior filed more than seventy-five ethics charges.

==Early life==
Bonior was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Irene (Gavreluk) and Edward Bonior. He traces his family history from Ukraine and Poland. He graduated from Notre Dame High School in Harper Woods, Michigan, in 1963, where he excelled in sports. He received a B.A. from the University of Iowa, where he also played football and became a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, in 1967. He received an M.A. from Chapman College in Orange, California, in 1972.

He served in the United States Air Force during the peak of the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1972, though not in Vietnam. He was a founder of the Vietnam Era Veterans Caucus on Capitol Hill and was a strong supporter of the Vietnam veterans&#x27; movement.

==Political career==
Bonior was a Democratic member of the Michigan State House of Representatives from 1973 to 1976. In 1976, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 12th District (based in Macomb County) for the 95th and to the twelve succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1977, to January 3, 2003. His district was renumbered as the 10th in 1993, after Michigan lost a House seat as a result of the 1990 United States Census.

From 1991 to 2002, Bonior was the House Democratic Whip. He served as Majority Whip in the 102nd and 103rd Congresses. He was Minority Whip for the 104th through 107th Congresses. While the Democrats were in the majority, Bonior was the third-ranking Democrat in the House, behind Speaker Tom Foley and House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt. While they were in the minority, Bonior was second-in-command behind Gephardt.

In Congress, Bonior generally had a progressive voting record, but opposed abortion in most cases. In 1991 he strongly supported recognition of Ukraine as an independent nation and was critical of the Bush administration on that matter.

For most of his tenure in Congress, Bonior represented a fairly compact district in Macomb and St. Clair counties northeast of Detroit. However, after the 2000 United States Census, Michigan lost one of its 16 seats in the House of Representatives. The redistricting task process was controlled by the Republican majority in the state legislature, and Bonior&#x27;s home in Mount Clemens was shifted from the 10th District to the 12th District. That district had long been represented by Democrat Sandy Levin, a longtime friend of Bonior&#x27;s. At the same time, the state legislature radically altered the 10th, extending it all the way to the Thumb. The new district was considerably more rural and Republican than its predecessor; George W. Bush narrowly won the old version of the 10th federal congressional district, but would have won the new modern version of the federal 10th congressional district by a large margin. By all accounts, the 10th had been redrawn for the popular Republican Michigan Secretary of State and Macomb County resident Candice Miller.

Due to this, Bonior did not run for reelection to the House, and chose to run for Governor of Michigan, stepping down as House Democratic Whip in January 2002; Nancy Pelosi of California succeeded him as Whip. He lost in a heavily contested Democratic Party primary between former Governor James Blanchard, and then-Michigan Attorney General and eventual party nominee Jennifer Granholm, who went on to win the general election. As expected, Miller easily won Bonior&#x27;s House seat and held it until eventually retiring in 2016. Proving how Republican-dominated the new district is, no Democratic nominee has won more than 40% of the vote since Bonior retired.

==Post-congressional career==
Following his retirement from the House, Bonior became a professor of labor studies at Wayne State University, and founded American Rights at Work, a union advocacy organization, of which he currently serves as chairman. In 2006, former Senator John Edwards chose Bonior to run his campaign for the presidency in 2008. Bonior served as campaign manager for the duration of Edwards&#x27; candidacy. Upon the election of Barack Obama in November 2008, Bonior was a member of the President-Elect&#x27;s economic advisory board.

He has also become a restaurateur, owning and operating the restaurants Agua 301 and Zest.

Bonior is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

Bonior and his wife were described as &quot;longtime&quot; members of the Democratic Socialists of America in 2015.

<text>George Safford Parker (November 1, 1863, Shullsburg – July 19, 1937, Chicago) was an American inventor and industrialist.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Parker was born in Shullsburg, Wisconsin in November 1863, and graduated from Upper Iowa University in Fayette, Iowa. 

He worked as a telegraphy instructor in Janesville, Wisconsin, and had a sideline repairing and selling fountain pens. Dismayed by the unreliability of the pens, he experimented with ways to prevent ink leaks.

===Career as Inventor and Industrialist===
In 1888 he founded the Parker Pen Company and the next year he received his first fountain pen patent. By 1908, his factory on Main Street in Janesville was reportedly the largest pen manufacturing facility in the world. Parker eventually became one of the world&#x27;s premier pen brands, and one of the first brands with a global presence. 

===Legacy===
George S. Parker High School in Janesville is his namesake.

<text>A poetry reading is a public oral recitation or performance of poetry. Reading poetry aloud allows the reader to express their own experience through poetry, changing the poem according to their sensibilities. The reader uses pitch and stress, and pauses become apparent. A poetry reading typically takes place on a small stage in a café or bookstore where multiple poets recite their own work. A more prominent poet may be chosen as the &quot;headliner&quot; of such an event and famous poets may also take the stage at a bigger venue such as an amphitheater or college auditorium.

How early poems like the &quot;Illiad&quot; were transmitted to audiences is not clear. Modern poetry readings only became popular in the last half of the twentieth century, at least in the United States, with stars like Dylan Thomas and Robert Frost. Live poetry reading competitions, called poetry slams and beginning in the 1980s, also remain popular. 
==Background==
Voice is an active, physical thing in oral poetry. It needs a speaker and a listener, a performer and an audience. It is a bodily creation that thrives in live connection.
The voice is the mechanism by which a &quot;poet&#x27;s voice&quot; comes alive. Reciting a poem aloud the reciter comes to understand and then to be the &#x27;voice&#x27; of the poem. As poetry is a vocal art, the speaker brings their own experience to it, changing it according to their own sensibilities, intonation, the matter of sound making sense; controlled through pitch and stress, poems are full of invisible italicized contrasts. Reading poetry aloud also makes clear the &quot;pause&quot; as an element of poetry.
&quot;The hearing knowledge we bring to a line if poetry is a knowledge of patterns of speech we have known since we were infants.&quot; Every speaker intuitively course through manipulations of sounds, almost as if we sing to each other all day. Even after three millennia of writing, poetry retains its appeal to the ear, the silent reading eye thereof, thereafter, hears what it is seeing. Sound that was imagined through the eye gradually gave body to poems in performance.

A public reading is typically given on a small stage in a café or bookstore, although reading by prominent poets frequently are booked into larger venues such as amphitheaters and college auditoriums, &#x27;to take poetry public&#x27;.

Poetry readings almost always involve poets reading their own work or reciting it from memory but readings often involve several readers (often called &quot;featured poets&quot; or &quot;featureds&quot;), although one poet can be chosen as a &quot;headliner&quot;.

==History==

Quite how early poems like the &quot;Illiad&quot; were first experienced by audiences remains not entirely clear. (But see rhapsode)

American poet Donald Hall described the increase in emphasis on public readings of poetry in the United States in a 2012 &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine blog post where he recounted it a phenomenon that grew in the last half of the twentieth century.

Hall, who speculates that the change may have been due to the star power of Dylan Thomas(1914-1953), wrote, &quot;It used to be that one poet in each generation performed poems in public. In the twenties, it was Vachel Lindsay, who sometimes dropped to his knees in the middle of a poem. Then Robert Frost took over, and made his living largely on the road.&quot; Hall suggests that poetry readings have shifted the focus of poetry more towards sound, adding that &quot;In concentrating on sound, as in anything else, there are things to beware of. Revising a poem one morning, I found myself knowing that a new phrase was repellent, but realized it would pass if I intoned it out loud. Watch out. A poem must work from the platform but it must also work on the page.&quot; Afroamerican poet Maya Angelou was a friend of Malcolm X, and she performanced poetry reading. Radical poet group The Last Poets performanced poetry reading with African conga, and Gil Scott-Heron play poetry reading with jazz music. Dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson recorded poetry reggae album &quot;Bass Culture&quot; in 1980.

==Poetry slam==
A poetry slam is a competitive format that has become increasingly popular, especially in the United States, since its inception in the 1980s. A &quot;slam&quot; is the art of poetry presented in public as is the &quot;open mic&quot; event variant.

<doc id="751457" wikidata="Q6113805" url="?curid=751457" title="Jack MacDonald (communist)">
<text>Jack MacDonald (nicknamed &quot;Moscow Jack&quot;; born 2 February 1888, in Falkirk, Scotland) was a founding member of the Communist Party of Canada and one of its leaders. He was party Chairman from 1921 to 1923, and National Secretary from 1923 to 1929.

MacDonald received a scholarship to attend high school, but economic necessity forced him into pattern making, the same occupation as his father. His imagination was &quot;fired by the revolutionary events of 1905 in Russia,&quot; and would become involved, and later president (1910–1912) of the Falkirk Pattern Makers Association, a member of the British Socialist Party, and a member of the Scottish Social Democratic Federation. He immigrated to Toronto in 1912, where he became involved with the local left.

MacDonald supported the expulsion of Maurice Spector for Trotskyism in 1928. Subsequently, he tried to play a balancing role between the Tim Buck&#x27;s Stalinist faction and the party majority headed by Finnish, Ukrainian and Jewish groups of which J.B. Salsberg was a notable figure. Macdonald failed and was expelled from the party in 1931 being accused of being a Lovestoneite (that is a supporter of Nikolai Bukharin&#x27;s Right Opposition). MacDonald, however, maintained that he was attempting to play an independent role. Accusations of &quot;Lovestoneism&quot; are further undermined by the fact that MacDonald went on to reconcile with Spector and joined the Toronto branch of the International Left Opposition (Trotskyist) Canada in 1932.

MacDonald and Spector sided with Martin Abern and Max Shachtman in a dispute within the Communist League of America that threatened to split the Trotskyist movement in North America in the early 1930s. The split emerged in the late 1930s, this time over the question of the class nature of the Soviet Union with MacDonald siding with Shachtman in his split from the International in 1940. Macdonald died of a sudden heart attack on 7 November 1941 as he was recovering from an earlier, unspecified operation. His short obituary was published in the short-lived Trotskyist paper &quot;Labor Challenge&quot; in 1941.

<doc id="751467" wikidata="Q5154682" url="?curid=751467" title="Community Climate System Model">
<text>The Community Climate System Model (CCSM) is a coupled general circulation model (GCM) developed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DoE), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The coupled components include an atmospheric model (Community Atmosphere Model), a land-surface model (Community Land Model), an ocean model (Parallel Ocean Program), and a sea ice model (Community Sea Ice Model, CICE). CCSM is maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

Its software design assumes a physical/dynamical component of the climate system and, as a freely available community model, is designed to work on a variety of machine architectures powerful enough to run the model. The CESM codebase is mostly public domain with some segregable components issued under open source and other licenses. The offline chemical transport model has been described as &quot;very efficient&quot;.

The model includes four submodels (land, sea-ice, ocean and atmosphere) connected by a coupler that exchanges information with the submodels. NCAR suggested that because of this, CCSM cannot be considered a single climate model, but rather a framework for building and testing various climate models.

==Submodels==

===Ocean model (docn6)===
The Climatological Data Ocean Model is recently at version6.0. It must be run within the framework of CCSM rather than standalone. It takes two netCDF datasets as input and sends six outputs to the coupler, to be integrated with the output of the other submodels.

===Atmosphere model (CAM)===
The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) can also be run as a standalone atmosphere model. Its most current version is 3.1, while 3.0 was the fifth generation. On May 17, 2002, its name was changed from the NCAR Community Climate Model to reflect its role in the new system. It shares the same horizontal grid as the land model of CCSM: a 256×128 regular longitude/latitude global horizontal grid (giving a 1.4 degree resolution). It has 26 levels in the vertical.

=== Sea Ice Model (CICE) ===
The polar component of ocean-atmosphere coupling includes sea ice geophysics using the formerly-known Los Alamos Sea Ice Model, CICE, now often referred to as the CICE Consortium model, to which NCAR has contributed code and physical improvements through the Polar Climate Working Group. CICE simulates the growth, movement, deformation and melt of sea ice, critical for calculating energy and mass fluxes between the polar atmosphere and oceans in the earth system.

==Development==
The first version of CCSM was created in 1983 as the Community Climate Model (CCM). Over the next two decades it was steadily improved and was renamed CCSM after the Climate System Model (CSM) components were introduced in May 1996. In June 2004 NCAR released the third version, which included new versions of all of the submodels. In 2007 this new version (commonly given the acronym CCSM3 or NCCCSM) was used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, alongside many others. In May 2010 NCAR released CCSM version4 (CCSM4). On June 25, 2010 NCAR released the successor to CCSM, called the Community Earth System Model (CESM), version1.0 (CESM1), as a unified code release that included CCSM4 as the code base for its atmospheric component.

<text>USS &quot;A. J. View&quot; – a Confederate States of America schooner – was captured during the beginning of the American Civil War by the Union Navy.

&quot;A. J. View&quot; was outfitted as a collier, supplying coal to Union ships with steam engines. Her record of activity is sparse.

==Service history==
Early in the afternoon of 28 November 1861, while cruising in Mississippi Sound, the Union screw steamer , Commander, C. H. B. Caldwell, fell in with and seized &quot;A. J. View&quot; (along with steamer CSS &quot;Henry Lewis&quot;) off Pascagoula, Mississippi, as that Biloxi, Mississippi schooner attempted to slip out to sea. The prize&#x27;s cargo was unloaded at Ship Island, Mississippi, and the schooner herself may have been used for sometime thereafter by the Gulf Blockading Squadron. At some later date, after she had sailed north for adjudication, &quot;A. J. View&quot; was finally condemned by the admiralty court at New York City and was sold to the Navy on 28 July 1863 – almost two years after she had been captured. She was used as a coal hulk, but no record of the place or places where she performed this service has been found.

<text>The University of St. Gallen (HSG) is a research university located in St. Gallen, Switzerland, that specialises in business administration, economics, law, international affairs, and computer science. It was established in 1898. It consistently ranks as one of the best business schools in Europe. In 2022, it had 9,590 students, of which 3,757 were master&#x27;s students and 584 were doctoral students.

Although one of Switzerland&#x27;s smallest universities, HSG has Switzerland&#x27;s largest faculty for business administration. It has produced more billionaires in Europe than any other European university. It is a member of the CEMS and APSIA and is EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA accredited (triple crown). Its campus is listed as a Swiss heritage site of national significance. The university is owned by the canton of St. Gallen.

==History==

===19th and 20th centuries===
In May 1898, the Cantonal Parliament of St. Gallen established an academy for trade, commerce and administration in St. Gallen. The actual founding father is considered to be Theodor Curti, then the head of the Department of Economic Affairs of the Canton of St. Gallen. The business academy commenced lectures in 1899, making it one of the first institutions of its kind in the world. From 1911 onward, the name &quot;Handels-Hochschule&quot; was used. In 1938, the former foundation under private law became a public institution, and in 1939 gained the right to award doctoral degrees.
In 1963, the university moved to new buildings and changed its name to &quot;Hochschule für Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften&quot;. The new buildings were planned for 900 students, but by the winter term of 1963/64, more than 1150 students were enrolled. With the enaction of the Higher Education Act of 1989, the university was renamed &quot;Hochschule St. Gallen für Wirtschafts-, Rechts- und Sozialwissenschaften&quot; to reflect its curricula. The university has had its law department since 1978. In 1989, the library building opened, and enrollment had grown to over 3900. In February 1994, the Cantonal Parliament of St. Gallen approved a bill to amend the Higher Education Act, leading to the renaming of the institution as &quot;Universität St. Gallen&quot; (University of St. Gallen). The acronym &quot;HSG&quot; remained.

===Recent history===
In the winter of 2001/02, the University of St. Gallen started the reorganization of its study programs. Education was classified into bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, making the university Switzerland&#x27;s pioneer in the Bologna process. In October 2005, the university&#x27;s Executive School of Management, Technology and Law (ES-HSG) was opened. The financially autonomous Executive School centralizes further educational activities such as MBA and executive MBA programs.

Mid-2005, the people of St. Gallen voted (with 66.4% in favour) to renovate, reorganize and expand the university by 2011. With a budget of about 80m Swiss francs, buildings from the 1960s were renovated, and its infrastructure was updated.

The University of St. Gallen is located atop Rosenberg Hill, overlooking the Altstadt of St. Gallen, with a view of the Alpstein mountain range. The campus is noted for its integration of art and architecture. The area around the university, including the town of St. Gallen at Lake Constance and the Alps, offers facilities for outdoor activities including skiing, hiking, climbing and sailing.
In the Main Building, designed by Walter Foerderer and regarded worldwide as a significant example of 1960s architecture, art is a major feature of the architecture; whereas in the Library Building of 1989, works of art complement the diversity of architectural forms narratively. There are works by Kemény, Penalba, Arp, Braque, Hajdu, Soniatta, Miró, Calder, Soulages, Giacometti, Tàpies, Coghuf, Otto Müller, Disler, Bill, Josef Felix Müller, Paladino, Richter, and Cucchi.

In 1995, a convention and executive education centre opened a few minutes walk from the main campus. Extended in 2007, it now comprises several plenary halls and 54 business rooms. The university also has international hubs in Singapore and São Paulo to connect local faculty, students, alumni and companies with its academic activities.

In 2019, the voters of the canton of St. Gallen approved the construction of an additional campus in the city. The new campus will create room for 3,000 additional students and will be opened in 2027.

In February 2022, the new HSG Learning Center &quot;SQUARE&quot; opened on the Rosenberg. It is intended to be an innovative place for thinking and working, enabling new types of learning and interaction between students, faculty and people from the field. The project is being realised by the HSG Foundation and financed entirely through donations. Over 800 donors have supported the HSG Learning Center to date. The project &quot;Open Grid - Choices of Tomorrow&quot; by Sou Fujimoto Architects won the architecture competition in 2018.

==Academics==

===Schools, institutes, and research centres===


Following a restructuring in 2011, there are five schools at the University of St. Gallen: the School of Management (SoM-HSG), the School of Finance (SoF-HSG), the Law School (LS-HSG), the School of Economics and Political Science (SEPS-HSG), and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (SHSS-HSG). Study programs are typically associated with a specific school but are taught jointly by faculty members from several schools. The Executive School of Management, Technology and Law (ES-HSG) plays a special role which has the status of an &quot;Institut mit besonderen gesamtuniversitären Aufgaben&quot; and which runs the MBA and executive education programs.

The crystallization points of research at the University of St. Gallen are about 40 institutes and research centres, which are an integral part of the university. The directors of the institutes double as professors of the University of St. Gallen. Bringing theory and practice together, the institutes provide important input for teaching at the university and play a significant role in furthering the careers of young academics. 80 tenured professors, 60 assistant professors and senior lecturers, and more than 300 lecturers and 300 assistants, plus distinguished visiting professors cultivate the scientific discourse with the students.

The University of St. Gallen is a member of the European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS) and the Auto-ID Labs network.

===Study programmes===

A new structure of Studies became operational as of winter 2001/2002. Degrees are now divided into Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral programmes under the Bologna Process. Since 2013, the bachelor&#x27;s degree programmes have started with an Assessment Year for all students. The Assessment Year in Economics and Law is offered in two separate tracks, with instruction in either German or English. The main difference between the two is that the English track offers an economics specialization that allows for subsequent Bachelor studies in Business Administration, Economics, International Affairs, or Law and Economics. The German track offers an additional option of a specialization in Law for students interested in pursuing Bachelor studies in Law. Many Master&#x27;s programmes and most Doctoral programmes are taught in English. 

Upon successful completion of the Assessment Year, students can then choose one of five majors for their remaining years of study as listed below. It is worth noting that the degrees are very flexible and most students take more than three years to finish their bachelor&#x27;s degree. The majority of Bachelor students are enrolled in Business Administration. Aside from the University of St. Gallen, only the University of Geneva offers an International Affairs programme within Switzerland. The Master&#x27;s programmes cover the same range of studies but are more specialised. The Master&#x27;s programmes typically run from 1.5 to 2 years. Besides the CEMS Master&#x27;s in International Management, further double degrees may be obtained in cooperation with partner universities such as Bocconi University, ESADE, HEC Paris, INCAE Business School, Nanyang Technological University, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Rotterdam School of Management, or Sciences Po Paris.

===Rankings===

*In 2016, CEMS refused to take part in the yearly FT Ranking. The programme made its comeback in 2017 at the 9th place.

==Student life==

The University of St. Gallen hosts 25% international students, an upper limit which has been fixed by the government.

There are about 130 clubs at the University of St. Gallen. Particularly well-known is the International Students&#x27; Committee, an organisation which plans and coordinates the annual St. Gallen Symposium. Since 1970, the St. Gallen Symposium has brought together leaders from business, science, politics and society with students from all over the world. AIESEC St. Gallen is a club that was founded in 1951 and provides an international internship programme. The largest club at the University of St. Gallen and the largest of its kind in Switzerland is the Helvetian Investment Club, a finance-focused career club with over 1,450 members. One of the largest clubs with more than 600 members is DocNet, the doctoral students&#x27; club at the University of St. Gallen. 

Founded in 2001, a major event of DocNet is the annual DocNet Management Symposium. A chapter of Oikos International, a student organisation for sustainable development, also plays an active role at the University of St. Gallen. Other clubs are mostly sports clubs, cultural clubs or associations of students of different countries or cantons, subject-specific clubs related to specialisations at the University of St. Gallen as well as fraternities.

The official organisation of former students of the University of St. Gallen is HSG Alumni. With more than 19,000 members and 80 alumni clubs on 4 continents, it is one of Europe&#x27;s leading associations of its kind. Since 1930, the club has been reinforcing alumni&#x27;s lifelong bonds with the university, as well as the networks among its members, utilising numerous events and information platforms.

==Controversies==
Following a 2019 investigation by the cantonal audit office, the University of St. Gallen came under heavy criticism for the frivolous spending behaviour in some of its institutes. Representatives of the cantonal legislature called for a change in the university&#x27;s culture of accountability.

In 2021, a professor at the University of St. Gallen ended her supervisor agreement with a temporarily deregistered doctorate student and had the university delete his email account, for making a negative comment on Twitter about China&#x27;s communication during the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis.

<doc id="751478" wikidata="Q3520265" url="?curid=751478" title="The Chinese Parrot">
<text>The Chinese Parrot (1926) is the second novel in the Charlie Chan series of mystery novels by Earl Derr Biggers and is the first in which Chan travels from Hawaii to mainland California.

The story concerns a valuable string of pearls which is purchased by a wealthy and eccentric financier. The handsome young son of the jeweller is assigned to deliver the pearls to the financier&#x27;s vacation home in a desert area of California. Because of his long association with the owner of the pearls (before joining the police force, he was her houseboy), Charlie Chan travels from Hawaii to California to also look after the pearls. After two mysterious deaths, first of a Chinese-speaking parrot and then of the household&#x27;s Chinese man-of-all-work, Charlie Chan masquerades as a pidgin-speaking cook named Ah Kim and works undercover to solve the crimes. Along the way, the jeweller&#x27;s son meets a beautiful young woman who works as a location scout and he decides to stay in the California desert.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
The novel was adapted for film twice, as &quot;The Chinese Parrot&quot; in 1927 and as &quot;Charlie Chan&#x27;s Courage&quot; in 1934 (both of which are considered lost films).

<doc id="751479" wikidata="Q4849074" url="?curid=751479" title="Baker's Game">
<text>Baker&#x27;s Game is a patience or solitaire card game similar to FreeCell. It predates FreeCell, and differs from it only in the fact that sequences are built by suit, instead of by alternate color. This makes the game more difficult to complete successfully.

== History ==

One of the oldest ancestors of Baker&#x27;s Game is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, Martin Gardner described in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column a game by C. L. Baker, that is now known as Baker&#x27;s Game. Gardner wrote &quot;The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s&quot;.

The description of Baker&#x27;s Game in the &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column inspired Paul Alfille to create FreeCell and he coded it for the PLATO educational computer system, which ended up becoming more popular than Baker&#x27;s Game.

== Rules ==

(Adapted from the FreeCell&#x27;s article Rules.)

Construction and layout:
*One standard 52-card deck is used.
*There are four open cells and four open foundations. (Some alternate rules use between one and ten cells.)
*The entire deck is dealt out left to right into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. (Some alternate rules will use between four and ten cascades.)

Building during play:
*The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.
*Tableau must be built down by the same suit.
*Foundations are built up by suit.

Moves:
*Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation (to make the game harder, only put kings on an empty cascade spot).
*Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. While computer implementations often show this motion, players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.

Victory:
*The game is won after all cards are moved in ascending number by suit to their foundation piles.

Variant: To make the game even more difficult, allow only kings to be placed on an empty tableau spot.

== Statistics ==

Freecell Solver, a solver for some variants of Patience game, including Baker&#x27;s Game, was run on the first 10 million deals of Baker&#x27;s Game with 4 reserve cells based on the Microsoft FreeCell deals, in order to collect statistics. The solver was run using a preset that guarantees an accurate verdict. Out of the 10 million deals, 7,431,962 were solvable (making for an average win rate of 74.3%), and the average number of moves required to solve was 107.5 moves (unoptimized).

<text>A summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it. The topographic terms acme, apex, peak (mountain peak), and [[zenith]] are synonymous.

The term  (mountain top) is generally used only for a mountain peak that is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher elevation. For example, a big, massive rock next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered &quot;subsummits&quot; (or &quot;subpeaks&quot;) of the higher peak, and are considered part of the same mountain. A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top. For summits that are permanently covered in significant layers of ice, the height may be measured by the highest point of rock (rock height) or the highest point of permanent solid ice (snow height).

The highest summit in the world is Mount Everest with a height of above sea level. The first official ascent was made by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. They reached the mountain&#x27;s peak in 1953.

Whether a highest point is classified as a summit, a sub peak or a separate mountain is subjective. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation&#x27;s definition of a 4,000 m peak is that it has a prominence of or more; it is a mountain summit if it has a prominence of at least . Otherwise, it is a subpeak.
&quot;Summit&quot; may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route. In many parts of the Western United States, the term &quot;summit&quot; is used for the highest point along a road, highway, or railroad, more commonly referred to as a &quot;pass&quot;. For example, the highest point along Interstate 80 in California is referred to as Donner Summit and the highest point on Interstate 5 is Siskiyou Mountain Summit. This can lead to confusion as to whether a labeled &quot;summit&quot; is a pass or a peak.

<doc id="751490" wikidata="Q6481248" url="?curid=751490" title="Lambert Gardens">
<text>Lambert Gardens was a botanical garden of over in the Reed neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, USA. It opened in 1930 and closed in 1968 and had a total estimated visitor count of 2,000,000, most of them believed to be out-of-towners.

==History==
Andrew Lambert, a landscaper in Georgia, visited Portland in 1925 and liked the flora so much he decided to settle there permanently. He gave his half of the family business to his brother and purchased land at 5120 SE 28th Avenue in the late 1920s. He also bought 25 unused and overgrown acres from the nearby Reed College to start his gardens and by 1930, it was a tourist attraction. Despite the high unemployment rate during the Great Depression, Lambert was able to employ 20 landscapers to look after the gardens, including the Sunken Rose Gardens and the Italian Court. The gardens were home to peacocks, cranes such as the grey crowned crane, and flamingos. Money from the wishing well was given to the Oregon School for the Blind. After thieves stole hundreds of dollars from the wishing well on multiple occasions, Lambert decided to put up a 10 foot fence around the perimeter of the gardens.

While most of the visitors to Lambert Gardens were from out of town, Lambert was an active part of the community. He sold plants, including tulips imported from Holland, out of the gardens&#x27; nursery and collaborated on a number of projects with Meier &amp; Frank. Each June, he reserved a plot for the town&#x27;s Rose Festival so the elected queen and her court could take photos in front of it, and each Christmas, traditionally the slow season for botanical gardens, the Lambert Gardens had what was described as &quot;one of the largest illuminated displays in the city&quot;. The gardens were used for weddings, entertaining dignitaries, and political speeches. Gardens employees also appeared on local TV to give gardening demonstrations, such as preparing a flowerbed for planting. The landscaping was so popular that in 1934, Lambert and his crew were hired to plant around the nearby U.S. Customs Courthouse. Some years later, they were also hired to overhaul and renovate the grounds at the University of Portland.

By 1968, Lambert sought a buyer for the gardens as he was becoming too old to maintain them but was unsuccessful. A development company eventually bought the plot to build a $16 million, 1,000-unit apartment complex, called Lambert Gardens Apartments. In 2005, another company bought the complex and renamed it Wimbledon Gardens.

Lambert died in January 1974.

<doc id="751493" wikidata="Q355319" url="?curid=751493" title="Adelphi Theatre">
<text>The Adelphi Theatre is a West End theatre, located on the Strand in the City of Westminster, central London. The present building is the fourth on the site. The theatre has specialised in comedy and musical theatre, and today it is a receiving house for a variety of productions, including many musicals. The theatre was Grade II listed for historical preservation on 1 December 1987.

==History==

===19th century===
It was founded in 1806 as the Sans Pareil (&quot;Without Compare&quot;), by merchant John Scott, and his daughter Jane (1770–1839). Jane was a British theatre manager, performer, and playwright. Together, they gathered a theatrical company and by 1809 the theatre was licensed for musical entertainments, pantomime, and burletta. She wrote more than fifty stage pieces in an array of genres: melodramas, pantomimes, farces, comic operettas, historical dramas, and adaptations, as well as translations. Jane Scott retired to Surrey in 1819, marrying John Davies Middleton (1790–1867).

On 18 October 1819, the theatre reopened under its present name, which was adopted from the Adelphi Buildings opposite.
In its early years, the theatre was known for melodrama, called &quot;Adelphi Screamers&quot;. Many stories by Charles Dickens were also adapted for the stage here, including John Baldwin Buckstone&#x27;s &quot;The Christening&quot;, a comic burletta, which opened on 13 October 1834, based on the story &quot;The Bloomsbury Christening&quot;. This is notable for being thought the first Dickens adaption performed. This was the first of many of Dickens&#x27;s early works adapted for the stage of the Adelphi, including &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; as William Leman Rede&#x27;s &quot;The Peregrinations of Pickwick&quot;; or, &quot;Boz-i- a-na&quot;, a three-act burletta first performed on 3 April 1837, Frederick Henry Yates&#x27;s production of &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;; or, &quot;Doings at Do-The-Boys Hall&quot; in November and December 1838, and Edward Stirling&#x27;s two-act burletta &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;; or, &quot;One Hour from Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot; (November and December 1840, January 1841). The theatre itself makes a cameo appearance in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;

The famous busker, Billy Waters often performed outside the Adelphi Theatre in the years before his death in 1823.

The Adelphi came under the management of Madame Celeste and comedian Benjamin Webster, in 1844, and Buckstone was appointed its resident dramatist. Dramatisations of Dickens continued to be performed, including &quot;A Christmas Carol; or, Past, Present, and Future&quot; opening on 5 February; and Beckett&#x27;s &quot;The Chimes: A Goblin Story of Some Bells that rang an Old Year out and a New One In&quot;. In 1848, &quot;The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x27;s Bargain&quot; was performed.
The old theatre was demolished, and on 26 December 1858, &quot;The New Adelphi&quot; was opened and was considered an improvement on the cramped circumstances of the original, which had been described as a &quot;hasty conversion from a tavern hall, permanently kept in its provisional state&quot;. The new theatre could seat 1,500 people, with standing room for another 500. The interior was lighted by a &quot;Stroud&#x27;s Patent Sun Lamp&quot;, a brilliant array of gas mantles passed through a chandelier of cut-glass.

In the mid-19th century, John Lawrence Toole established his comedic reputation at the Adelphi. Also in the mid-19th century, the Adelphi hosted a number of French operettas, including &quot;La belle Hélène&quot;. In 1867, however, the Adelphi gave English comic opera a boost by hosting the first public performance of Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Cox and Box&quot;.

The building was renovated in 1879 and again in 1887 when the house next door, along with The Hampshire Hog in The Strand and the Nell Gwynne Tavern in Bull Inn Court, were bought by the Gattis in order to enlarge the theatre. They also built a new enlarged facade and part of this can still be seen today above the Crystal Rooms next door to the present Adelphi Theatre.

An actor who performed regularly at the Adelphi in the latter half of the 19th century, William Terriss, was stabbed to death during the run of &#x27;Secret Service&#x27; on 16 December 1897 whilst entering the Theatre by the royal entrance in Maiden Lane which he used as a private entrance. This is now recorded on a plaque on the wall by the stage door. Outside a neighbouring pub, a sign says that the killer was one of the theatre&#x27;s stage hands, but Richard Archer Prince committed the murder. It has been said that Terriss&#x27; ghost haunts the theatre. Terriss&#x27; daughter was Ellaline Terriss, a famous actress, and her husband, actor-manager Seymour Hicks managed the Adelphi for some years at the end of the 19th century. The stage door of the current Adelphi is in Maiden Lane but back then it was in Bull Inn Court. William Terriss would later have a Theatre named after him, the Terriss Theatre in Rotherhithe, later known as the Rotherhithe Hippodrome.

The adjacent, numbers 409 and 410 Strand, were built in 1886–87 by the Gatti Brothers as the Adelphi Restaurant. The frontage remains essentially the same, but with plate glass windows, and, like the theatre, is a Grade II listed building.

===20th century===

On 11 September 1901, the third theatre was opened as the &quot;Century Theatre&quot;, although the name reverted in 1904 under the management of Otho Stuart. This theatre was built by &quot;Frank Kirk&quot; to the design of Ernest Runtz. George Edwardes, the dean of London musical theatre, took over management of the theatre from Stuart in 1908. In the early part of the 20th century, the Adelphi was home to a number of musical comedies, the most successful of which included &quot;The Earl and the Girl&quot; (1904), &quot;The Dairymaids&quot; (1907), &quot;The Quaker Girl&quot; (1910), &quot;The Boy&quot; (1917), &quot;Clowns in Clover&quot; (1927), and &quot;Mr. Cinders&quot; (1929).

The present Adelphi opened on 3 December 1930, redesigned in the Art Deco style by Ernest Schaufelberg. It was named the &#x27;Royal Adelphi Theatre&#x27; and re-opened with the hit musical &quot;Ever Green&quot;, by Lorenz Hart and Richard Rodgers, based on the book Benn W. Levy. Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Words and Music&quot; premièred at the theatre in 1932. The operetta &quot;Balalaika&quot; (a revised version of &quot;The Gay Hussars&quot;) played at the theatre in 1936, and in 1940 the theatre&#x27;s name again reverted to &#x27;The Adelphi&#x27;. The theatre continued to host comedy and musicals, including &quot;Bless The Bride&quot; (1947), &quot;Maggie May&quot; (1964), and &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; (1975), as well as dramas (see below for a list beginning in 1979).

A proposed redevelopment of Covent Garden by the GLC in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby Vaudeville, Garrick, Lyceum and Duchess theatres. An active campaign by Equity, the Musicians&#x27; Union, and theatre owners under the auspices of the &quot;Save London Theatres Campaign&quot; led to the abandonment of the scheme.

On 27 February 1982, the Adelphi hosted the final night of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company for a concert performance of songs from all thirteen Savoy Operas as well as &quot;Cox and Box&quot; and &quot;Thespis&quot;. In 1993, Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Group purchased the theatre and completely refurbished it prior to the opening of his adaptation of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. The 1998 video of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Cats&quot; was filmed at the theatre.

===21st century===
In November 1997, the London production of the popular American musical &quot;Chicago&quot; premiered at the Adelphi, becoming the venue&#x27;s longest-ever production during its eight-and-a-half-year run (which also made it the longest running American musical in West End history). In April 2006, &quot;Chicago&quot; transferred to the Cambridge Theatre (and later to the Garrick Theatre, where it closed in 2012.).

Michael Grandage&#x27;s revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Evita&quot; replaced the show, beginning previews on 2 June 2006 before completing a twelve-month run on 26 May 2007. Brian Wilson performed his album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; for the last time in the UK at the Adelphi in November 2006. From 6 July 2007, the Adelphi was home to another Lloyd Webber revival, &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. The actor playing Joseph, Lee Mead, was cast by winning the BBC television show &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot;, and starred alongside Preeya Kalidas and Dean Collinson.
9 March 2010 saw the premiere of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;, which closed on Saturday 27 August 2011. The National Theatre transferred their show &quot;One Man, Two Guvnors&quot; to the theatre from 8 November 2011. This production moved out of the theatre on 25 February 2012, transferring to the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.

&quot;Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; began a limited season at the Adelphi from 10 March to 22 September 2012, transferring from the Chichester Festival Theatre, starring Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton.

In March 2019, &quot;Waitress&quot; opened at the Adelphi. It was set to close on 4 July 2020, but it closed on 16 March, when West End theatres shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the producers later announced the show would not re-open.

The theatre is currently owned and managed by the Adelphi Theatre Company Limited, a partnership between Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s LW Theatres and Nederlander International.

<doc id="751496" wikidata="Q4880812" url="?curid=751496" title="Behind That Curtain">
<text>Behind That Curtain (1928) is the third novel in the Charlie Chan series of mystery novels by Earl Derr Biggers.

==Plot summary==

It is set almost exclusively in California (as opposed to Chan&#x27;s Hawaii), and tells the story of the former head of Scotland Yard, a detective who is pursuing the long-cold trail of a murderer. Fifteen years ago, a London solicitor was killed in circumstances in which the only clue was a pair of Chinese slippers, which he apparently donned just before his death. Sir Frederic Bruce has been following the trail of the killer ever since. He has also been interested in what appears to be a series of disappearing women around the world, which has some connection to the disappearance of a woman named Eve Durand in rural India also fifteen years ago. Just when it seems he might finally solve the murder case, at a dinner party to which a number of important and mysterious guests have been invited, Inspector Bruce is killed—and was last seen wearing a pair of Chinese slippers, which have vanished. It is left to Chan to solve the case and tie up all loose ends.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
It was adapted for film as &quot;Behind That Curtain&quot; in 1929 and elements were used for &quot;Charlie Chan&#x27;s Chance&quot; (now considered a lost film) in 1932. The 1929 film was chosen to open the Fox Theatre in San Francisco on 28 June 1929.

<doc id="751502" wikidata="Q3137997" url="?curid=751502" title="Lone wolf terrorism">
<text>Lone wolf terrorism, or lone actor terrorism, is a particular kind of terrorism committed by an individual who both plans and commits the act on their own. The precise definition of the term varies, and some definitions include those directed by larger organizations and small cells. Other names for the phenomenon include lone operator terrorism, &quot;freelancers&quot;, solo terrorists, and individual terror cells. 

The name &#x27;lone wolf&#x27; is derived from the notion of a lone wolf, a pack animal that has left or been excluded from its pack. The term was popularized in the late 1990s, from the FBI and the San Diego Police&#x27;s investigation into the activities of white supremacists Alex Curtis and Tom Metzger, named Operation Lone Wolf, largely due to their encouragement of other racists to commit violent acts, which they dubbed &quot;lone wolf&quot; action. Compared to the general population and members of organized terrorist groups, lone wolf terrorists are more likely to have been diagnosed with a mental illness, though it is not an accurate profiler.

==Definition==
The term lone actor or lone wolf is not a legal term or a social science concept. It is an ill-defined and academically contested construct, manufactured by the media and by radical political actors. It is usually defined as a terrorist who operates on their own without outside help. Other definitions include terrorists who operated solely on their own, but also those who committed an act themselves while being directed by a larger organization, groups of two and small cells.

Other equivalent terms include lone operator terrorism, freelancers, solo terrorists, and individual terror cells. It is related to the tactic of leaderless resistance. The descriptor &#x27;lone wolf&#x27; is derived from the notion of a lone wolf, a pack animal that has left or been excluded from its pack. This particular term is more likely to be used by American law enforcement than by academics who study this phenomenon. The term was popularized in the late 1990s, from the FBI and the San Diego Police&#x27;s investigation into the activities of white supremacists Alex Curtis and Tom Metzger, named Operation Lone Wolf, largely due to their encouragement of other racists to commit violent acts, which they dubbed &quot;lone wolf&quot; action.

==Motives==
Lone actor terrorists are ideologically driven, with political or religious motives, and are intended to create fear and influence public opinion. Lone wolf terrorists may sympathize with and consider themselves part of larger groups, but they are usually not active participants. The links between lone wolves and actual terrorist groups tend to be informal and conducted online. These individuals tend to become radicalized online and through media outlets.

There have been cases of terrorist attacks conducted by individuals which were later found to have been directed remotely by terrorist organisations. Thus they were technically not lone wolves.

==History==
Lone actor attacks have become the subject of academic research. Historian Richard Jenson says the years 1878–1934 were the era of anarchist terrorism and should be considered the classic age of &quot;lone wolf&quot; or leaderless terrorism. Anarchists rejected authoritarian, centralized control over acts of planned violence as well as over anything else. Jenson says there were hundreds of violent anarchist incidents during this period most of which were committed by lone individuals or very small groups without command structures or leaders. Since 1940, there have been around 100 successful lone wolf attacks in the United States. 

While the lone wolf acts to advance the ideological or philosophical beliefs of an extremist group, they act on their own, without any outside command or direction. The lone wolf&#x27;s tactics and methods are conceived and directed solely on their own; in many cases, such as the tactics described by Curtis, the lone wolf never has personal contact with the group they identify with. As such, it is considerably more difficult for counter-terrorism officials to gather intelligence on lone wolves, since they may not come into contact with routine counter-terrorist surveillance. A 2013 analysis by Sarah Teich, a research assistant at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, found five emerging trends in Islamist lone wolf terrorism in North America and western Europe between 1990 and 2013:
*An increase in the number of countries targeted by lone wolves from the 1990s to the 2000s.
*An increase in the number of people injured and killed by lone wolves.
*Increased effectiveness of law enforcement and counter-terrorism.
*Consistency in the distribution of attacks by &quot;actor types&quot; (loners, lone wolves, and lone wolf packs).
*An increase in the number of attacks against military personnel.

In the United States, lone wolves may present a greater threat than organized groups.

According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, counter-terrorism officials refer to &quot;lone individuals known to authorities but not considered important enough to escalate investigations&quot; as &quot;known wolves&quot;.

Some groups actively advocate lone wolf actions. Anti-abortion militant terrorist group the Army of God uses &quot;leaderless resistance&quot; as its organizing principle. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in news analysis of the Boston Marathon bombing, the Al-Qaeda activist Samir Khan, publishing in &quot;Inspire&quot;, advocated individual terrorist actions directed at Americans and published detailed recipes online.

==Mental health factors==
Compared to the general population, lone wolf terrorists are significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with a mental illness, although it is not an accurate profiler. Studies have found that roughly a third of lone wolf terrorists have been diagnosed at some point in their life with a mental illness. This puts lone wolves as being 13.5 times more likely to suffer from a mental illness than a member of an organized terrorist group, such as al-Qaeda or ISIS. Environmental factors such as relationships with those belonging to a terrorist group, social isolation, and various stressors mediate the relationship between mental illness and lone wolf terrorism.

Mental health challenges are thought to make some individuals among the many who suffer from certain &quot;psychological disturbances&quot;, vulnerable to being inspired by extremist ideologies to commit acts of lone wolf terrorism. An alternative explanation is that terrorist groups reject those with mental illnesses as they pose a security risk, creating a selection bias.

== Stochastic terrorism ==

Stochastic terrorism refers to political or media figures publicly demonizing a person or group, inspiring their supporters to commit a violent act against the target of the speech. Unlike incitement to terrorism, this is done using indirect, vague or coded language, which allows the instigator to plausibly disclaim responsibility for the resulting violence. Global trends point to increasing violent rhetoric and political violence, including more evidence of stochastic terrorism. It is in this manner that the stochastic terrorist is thought to randomly incite individuals predisposed to acts of violence. Because stochastic terrorists do not target and incite individual perpetrators of terror with their message, the perpetrator may be labeled a lone wolf by law enforcement, while the inciters avoid legal culpability and public scrutiny. In their 2017 book &quot;The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism&quot;, criminologist Mark S. Hamm and sociologist Ramón Spaaij discuss stochastic terrorism as a form of &quot;indirect enabling&quot; of terrorists. They write that &quot;stochastic terrorism is the method of international recruitment used by ISIS&quot;, and they refer to Anwar al-Awlaki and Alex Jones as stochastic terrorists.

<text>The Black Camel (1929) is the fourth of the Charlie Chan novels by Earl Derr Biggers.

==Plot summary==

It tells the story of a Hollywood star (Shelah Fane), who is stopping in Hawaii after she finished shooting a film on location in Tahiti. She is murdered in the pavilion of her rental house in Waikiki during her stay. The story behind her murder is linked with the three-year-old murder of another Hollywood actor and also connected with an enigmatic psychic named Tarneverro. Chan, in his position as a detective with the Honolulu Police Department, &quot;investigates amid public clamor demanding that the murderer be found and punished immediately. &quot;Death is a black camel that kneels unbidden at every gate. Tonight black camel has knelt here&quot;, Chan tells the suspects.&quot;

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
It was adapted into a film of the same name based on the book and released in 1931. This was the second of a series of sixteen Chan films to feature Warner Oland as the sleuth.

==References==
2. In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;I Will Fear No Evil&quot;, the kneeling black camel reference is employed as a euphemism for death near the start of chapter 2.

3. In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s first published work, a short story called &quot;Lifeline&quot;, Dr. Pinero says &quot;I can tell you when the Black Camel will kneel at your door.&quot;

<doc id="751519" wikidata="Q1416996" url="?curid=751519" title="Comparative statics">
<text>In economics, comparative statics is the comparison of two different economic outcomes, before and after a change in some underlying exogenous parameter.

As a type of &quot;static analysis&quot; it compares two different equilibrium states, after the process of adjustment (if any). It does not study the motion towards equilibrium, nor the process of the change itself.

Comparative statics is commonly used to study changes in supply and demand when analyzing a single market, and to study changes in monetary or fiscal policy when analyzing the whole economy. Comparative statics is a tool of analysis in microeconomics (including general equilibrium analysis) and macroeconomics. Comparative statics was formalized by John R. Hicks (1939) and Paul A. Samuelson (1947) (Kehoe, 1987, p. 517) but was presented graphically from at least the 1870s.

For models of stable equilibrium rates of change, such as the neoclassical growth model, comparative dynamics is the counterpart of comparative statics (Eatwell, 1987).

==Linear approximation==

Comparative statics results are usually derived by using the implicit function theorem to calculate a linear approximation to the system of equations that defines the equilibrium, under the assumption that the equilibrium is stable. That is, if we consider a sufficiently small change in some exogenous parameter, we can calculate how each endogenous variable changes using only the first derivatives of the terms that appear in the equilibrium equations.

For example, suppose the equilibrium value of some endogenous variable formula_1 is determined by the following equation:
:formula_2

where formula_3 is an exogenous parameter. Then, to a first-order approximation, the change in formula_1 caused by a small change in formula_3 must satisfy:
:formula_6

Here formula_7 and formula_8 represent the changes in formula_1 and formula_3, respectively, while formula_11 and formula_12 are the partial derivatives of formula_13 with respect to formula_1 and
formula_3 (evaluated at the initial values of formula_1 and formula_3), respectively. Equivalently, we can write the change in formula_1 as:
:formula_19

Dividing through the last equation by d&quot;a&quot; gives the comparative static derivative of &quot;x&quot; with respect to &quot;a&quot;, also called the multiplier of &quot;a&quot; on &quot;x&quot;:

:formula_20

===Many equations and unknowns===
All the equations above remain true in the case of a system of formula_21 equations in formula_21 unknowns. In other words, suppose formula_23 represents a system of formula_21 equations involving the vector of formula_21 unknowns formula_1, and the vector of formula_27 given parameters formula_3. If we make a sufficiently small change formula_8 in the parameters, then the resulting changes in the endogenous variables can be approximated arbitrarily well by formula_30. In this case, formula_11 represents the formula_21×formula_21 matrix of partial derivatives of the functions formula_13 with respect to the variables formula_1, and formula_12 represents the formula_21×formula_27 matrix of partial derivatives of the functions formula_13 with respect to the parameters formula_3. (The derivatives in formula_11 and formula_12 are evaluated at the initial values of formula_1 and formula_3.) Note that if one wants just the comparative static effect of one exogenous variable on one endogenous variable, Cramer&#x27;s Rule can be used on the totally differentiated system of equations formula_45.

===Stability===
The assumption that the equilibrium is stable matters for two reasons. First, if the equilibrium were unstable, a small parameter change might cause a large jump in the value of formula_1, invalidating the use of a linear approximation. Moreover, Paul A. Samuelson&#x27;s correspondence principle states that stability of equilibrium has qualitative implications about the comparative static effects. In other words, knowing that the equilibrium is stable may help us predict whether each of the coefficients in the vector formula_47 is positive or negative. Specifically, one of the &quot;n&quot; necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for stability is that the determinant of the &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;B&quot; have a particular sign; since this determinant appears as the denominator in the expression for formula_48, the sign of the determinant influences the signs of all the elements of the vector formula_49 of comparative static effects.

====An example of the role of the stability assumption====
Suppose that the quantities demanded and supplied of a product are determined by the following equations:

:formula_50

:formula_51

where formula_52 is the quantity demanded, formula_53 is the quantity supplied, &quot;P&quot; is the price, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are intercept parameters determined by exogenous influences on demand and supply respectively, &quot;b&quot; &lt; 0 is the reciprocal of the slope of the demand curve, and &quot;g&quot; is the reciprocal of the slope of the supply curve; &quot;g&quot; &gt; 0 if the supply curve is upward sloped, &quot;g&quot; = 0 if the supply curve is vertical, and &quot;g&quot; &lt; 0 if the supply curve is backward-bending. If we equate quantity supplied with quantity demanded to find the equilibrium price formula_54, we find that

:formula_55

This means that the equilibrium price depends positively on the demand intercept if &quot;g&quot; – &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0, but depends negatively on it if &quot;g&quot; – &quot;b&quot; &lt; 0. Which of these possibilities is relevant? In fact, starting from an initial static equilibrium and then changing &quot;a&quot;, the new equilibrium is relevant &quot;only&quot; if the market actually goes to that new equilibrium. Suppose that price adjustments in the market occur according to

:formula_56

where formula_57 &gt; 0 is the speed of adjustment parameter and formula_58 is the time derivative of the price — that is, it denotes how fast and in what direction the price changes. By stability theory, &quot;P&quot; will converge to its equilibrium value if and only if the derivative formula_59 is negative. This derivative is given by

:formula_60

This is negative if and only if &quot;g&quot; – &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0, in which case the demand intercept parameter &quot;a&quot; positively influences the price. So we can say that while the direction of effect of the demand intercept on the equilibrium price is ambiguous when all we know is that the reciprocal of the supply curve&#x27;s slope, &quot;g&quot;, is negative, in the only relevant case (in which the price actually goes to its new equilibrium value) an increase in the demand intercept increases the price. Note that this case, with &quot;g&quot; – &quot;b&quot; &gt; 0, is the case in which the supply curve, if negatively sloped, is steeper than the demand curve.

==Without constraints==
Suppose formula_61 is a smooth and strictly concave objective function where &quot;x&quot; is a vector of &quot;n&quot; endogenous variables and &quot;q&quot; is a vector of &quot;m&quot; exogenous parameters. Consider the unconstrained optimization problem formula_62.
Let formula_63, the &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix of first partial derivatives of formula_61 with respect to its first &quot;n&quot; arguments &quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
The maximizer formula_65 is defined by the &quot;n&quot;×1 first order condition formula_66.

Comparative statics asks how this maximizer changes in response to changes in the &quot;m&quot; parameters. The aim is to find formula_67.

The strict concavity of the objective function implies that the Jacobian of &quot;f&quot;, which is exactly the matrix of second partial derivatives of &quot;p&quot; with respect to the endogenous variables, is nonsingular (has an inverse). By the implicit function theorem, then, formula_65 may be viewed locally as a continuously differentiable function, and the local response of formula_65 to small changes in &quot;q&quot; is given by 
:formula_70
Applying the chain rule and first order condition,
:formula_71
(See Envelope theorem).

===Application for profit maximization===
Suppose a firm produces &quot;n&quot; goods in quantities formula_72. The firm&#x27;s profit is a function &quot;p&quot; of formula_72 and of &quot;m&quot; exogenous parameters formula_74 which may represent, for instance, various tax rates. Provided the profit function satisfies the smoothness and concavity requirements, the comparative statics method above describes the changes in the firm&#x27;s profit due to small changes in the tax rates.

==With constraints==
A generalization of the above method allows the optimization problem to include a set of constraints. This leads to the general envelope theorem. Applications include determining changes in Marshallian demand in response to changes in price or wage.

==Limitations and extensions==
One limitation of comparative statics using the implicit function theorem is that results are valid only in a (potentially very small) neighborhood of the optimum—that is, only for very small changes in the exogenous variables. Another limitation is the potentially overly restrictive nature of the assumptions conventionally used to justify comparative statics procedures. For example, John Nachbar discovered in one of his case studies that using comparative statics in general equilibrium analysis works best with very small, individual level of data rather than at an aggregate level. 

Paul Milgrom and Chris Shannon pointed out in 1994 that the assumptions conventionally used to justify the use of comparative statics on optimization problems are not actually necessary—specifically, the assumptions of convexity of preferred sets or constraint sets, smoothness of their boundaries, first and second derivative conditions, and linearity of budget sets or objective functions. In fact, sometimes a problem meeting these conditions can be monotonically transformed to give a problem with identical comparative statics but violating some or all of these conditions; hence these conditions are not necessary to justify the comparative statics. Stemming from the article by Milgrom and Shannon as well as the results obtained by Veinott and Topkis an important strand of operational research was developed called monotone comparative statics. In particular, this theory concentrates on the comparative statics analysis using only conditions that are independent of order-preserving transformations. The method uses lattice theory and introduces the notions of quasi-supermodularity and the single-crossing condition. The wide application of monotone comparative statics to economics includes production theory, consumer theory, game theory with complete and incomplete information, auction theory, and others.

<text>David Robinson (born April 2, 1949) is a retired American rock drummer. He has performed with many rock bands, including the Rising Tide, the Modern Lovers, the Pop!, DMZ and the Cars. In 2018, Robinson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Cars.

==Background==
Born in Malden, Massachusetts, Robinson attended Woburn Memorial High School. From 1970 to 1973, he was a member of the Modern Lovers. Robinson co-formed the Cars in 1976, and came up with the Cars&#x27; band name and is credited with designing the album covers. Robinson was the only member of the Cars who was a Massachusetts native. He was a member of DMZ when he left to form the Cars. After the breakup of the Cars, Robinson retired from the music industry, and ran a restaurant. He was an extra in several films, including &quot;Housesitter&quot; and &quot;The Crucible&quot;. In 2010, Robinson reunited with the surviving original members of the Cars to record their first album in 24 years, titled &quot;Move Like This&quot;. He had to relearn how to play the drums since (aside from loose jamming on the congas) he had stopped playing in 1987. After the completion of &quot;Move Like This&quot;, Robinson said that he would be interested in working on more studio albums.

As of August 2018, Robinson runs an art gallery in Rockport, Massachusetts, where he sells jewelry that he makes himself. In 2020, Robinson appeared in an episode of &quot;Chasing Classic Cars&quot; in which his 1969 De Tomaso Mangusta was restored.

<text>Charlie Chan Carries On (1930) is the fifth novel in the Charlie Chan series by Earl Derr Biggers.

==Plot summary==
Inspector Duff, a Scotland Yard detective and friend of Chan&#x27;s, first introduced in &quot;Behind That Curtain&quot;, is pursuing a murderer on an around-the-world voyage; so far, there have been murders in London, France, Italy and Japan. While his ship is docked in Honolulu, the detective is shot and wounded by his quarry; though he survives, he is unable to continue with the cruise, and Chan takes his place instead. Eventually, Chan finds the killer before the next port of call.

==Film adaptations==
A film entitled &quot;Charlie Chan Carries On&quot;, starring Warner Oland, was produced in 1931. The film is now considered to be a lost film, with only a trailer known to survive.

However, Fox filmed a Spanish-language version starring Manuel Arbó, using many of the same sets, using a Spanish-speaking cast, which was released under the title Eran Trece (&quot;There Were Thirteen&quot;). This used many of the same pieces of stock footage as the English-language version and the script was expanded somewhat based on the English-language script. This Spanish-language version is currently available as a bonus feature on the DVD release of &quot;Charlie Chan in Shanghai&quot;.

The film &quot;Charlie Chan&#x27;s Murder Cruise&quot; (1940), starring Sidney Toler, Oland&#x27;s successor in the role, was also based on the novel.

<text>Johann Hieronymus Schröter (30 August 1745, Erfurt – 29 August 1816, Lilienthal) was a German astronomer.

== Life ==

Schröter was born in Erfurt, and studied law at Göttingen University from 1762 until 1767, after which he started a ten-year-long legal practice.

In 1777 he was appointed Secretary of the Royal Chamber of George III in Hanover, where he made the acquaintance of two of William Herschel&#x27;s brothers. In 1779, he acquired a three-foot-long (91 cm, almost one metre) achromatic refractor with lens (50 mm) to observe the Sun, Moon, and Venus. Herschel&#x27;s discovery of Uranus in 1781 inspired Schröter to pursue astronomy more seriously, and he resigned his post and became chief magistrate and district governor of Lilienthal.

In 1784, he paid 31 Reichsthaler (about 600 Euros of today) for a Herschel reflector of 122 cm focal length and 12 cm aperture. He quickly gained a good name from his observational reports in journals, but was not satisfied and in 1786 paid 600 Reichstaler (an equivalent of six months earnings) for a 214 cm focal length 16.5 cm aperture reflector with eyepieces allowing up to 1,200 magnification, and 26 Thaler for a screw-micrometer. With this, he systematically observed Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

Schröter made extensive drawings of the features of Mars, yet curiously he was always erroneously convinced that what he was seeing was mere cloud formations rather than geographical features. In 1791, he published an important early study on the topography of the Moon entitled &quot;Selenotopographische Fragmente zur genauern Kenntniss der Mondfläche&quot;. The visual lunar albedo scale developed in this work was
later popularised by Thomas Gwyn Elger and now bears his name. In 1793, he was the first to notice the phase anomaly of Venus, now known as the Schröter effect, where the phase appears more concave than geometry predicts.

His two famous assistant astronomers were Karl Ludwig Harding (1796–1805) and Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1806–1810).

In 1813, he suffered the disruptions of the Napoleonic Wars: his work was ruined by the French under Vandamme, who destroyed his books, writings and observatory. He never recovered from the catastrophe.

His drawings of Mars were not rediscovered until 1873 (by François J. Terby) and were not published until 1881 (by H. G. van de Sande Bakhuyzen), well after his death.

He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1794 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1798.

The lunar crater Schröter and the Martian crater Schroeter are named after him, as is Vallis Schröteri (Schröter&#x27;s Valley) on the Moon.

<doc id="751534" wikidata="Q1141952" url="?curid=751534" title="Nihonbashi">
<text>is a business district of Chūō, Tokyo, Japan which sprung up around the bridge of the same name that has linked two sides of the Nihonbashi River at this site since the 17th century. The first wooden bridge was completed in 1603. The current bridge, designed by Tsumaki Yorinaka and constructed of stone on a steel frame, dates from 1911. The district covers a large area to the north and east of the bridge, reaching Akihabara to the north and the Sumida River to the east. Ōtemachi and Yaesu are to the west and Kyobashi to the south.

Nihonbashi, together with Kyobashi and Kanda, is the core of Shitamachi, the original downtown center of Edo-Tokyo, before the rise of newer secondary centers such as Shinjuku and Shibuya.

==History==
The Nihonbashi district was a major mercantile center during the Edo period: its early development is largely credited to the Mitsui family, who based their wholesaling business in Nihonbashi and developed Japan&#x27;s first department store, Mitsukoshi, there. The Edo-era fish market formerly in Nihonbashi was the predecessor of the Tsukiji and Toyosu Markets. Yamamotoyama began as a tea house here in 1690.

In later years, Nihonbashi emerged as Tokyo&#x27;s (and Japan&#x27;s) predominant financial district.

The Nihonbashi bridge first became famous during the 17th century, when it was the eastern terminus of the Nakasendō and the Tōkaidō, roads which ran between Edo and Kyoto. During this time, it was known as &quot;Edobashi&quot;, or &quot;Edo Bridge.&quot; In the Meiji era, the wooden bridge was replaced by a larger stone bridge, which still stands today (a replica of the old bridge has been exhibited at the Edo-Tokyo Museum). It is the point from which all distances are measured to the capital; highway signs indicating the distance to Tokyo actually state the number of kilometres to Nihonbashi.
The area surrounding the bridge was burned to the ground during the massive March 9–10, 1945 bombing of Tokyo, considered the single largest air raid in history. Despite careful maintenance and restoration, one area of the bridge still has scars burned into the stone from an incendiary bomb. It is one of the few traces left from the fire bombing that leveled most of Tokyo.

Nihonbashi was a ward of Tokyo City. In 1947, when the 35 wards of Tokyo were reorganized into 23, it was merged with Kyōbashi to form the modern Chuo ward.

Shortly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, an expressway was built over the Nihonbashi bridge, obscuring the classic view of Mount Fuji from the bridge. In recent years, local citizens have petitioned the government to move this expressway underground. This plan was endorsed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in 2005, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism announced in 2017 that they would begin a detailed study of the project, with a goal of beginning construction following the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The operator of the Shuto Expressway received approval for construction in May 2020, which will relocate 1.8 kilometers of the expressway underground between Kandabashi and Edobashi Junctions. Construction has commenced and is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2041.

<doc id="751535" wikidata="Q7874939" url="?curid=751535" title="USS Tyler">
<text>USS &quot;Tyler&quot; was originally a merchant steamboat named &quot;A. O. Tyler&quot;, a commercial side-wheel steamboat with twin stacks and covered paddles positioned aft. Constructed in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1857, it was acquired by the United States Navy, 5 June 1861 for service in the American Civil War and converted into the gunboat USS &quot;Tyler&quot; on 5 June 1861. She was commissioned in September 1861. She was protected with thick wooden bulwarks.

==Before military acquisition==
Just four days after Mississippi&#x27;s secession, on the evening of 13 January 1861, the steamboat was fired upon by cannon used by militia defending Vicksburg.

==On the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers==

&quot;Tyler&quot; served in the Western Flotilla from June 1861 to 1 October 1862, fighting for the Mississippi River. Soon after being commissioned, &quot;Tyler&quot; participated in the attack on the Confederate forces in Hickman and Columbus in Kentucky, doing battle with the CSS &quot;Jackson&quot;. In November 1861, &quot;Tyler&quot; escorted troops transports for an assault on Belmont, Missouri. Along with , &quot;Tyler&quot; bombarded Columbus until forced by a Confederate counterattack to cover the withdrawal of the Union troops.

In February 1862, &quot;Tyler&quot; assisted in General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s advance up the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers, helping in the capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, securing western Kentucky for Federal forces. Between assaults on the two forts, &quot;Tyler&quot; joined and &quot;Lexington&quot; moving along the Tennessee River, destroying an important railroad bridge and capturing three Confederate gunboats, most notably the CSS &quot;Eastport&quot; which was converted into an ironclad for Union service. After participating in the two-day action which culminated in the surrender of Fort Donelson, &quot;Tyler&quot; resumed operations on the Tennessee River in support of Grant&#x27;s advance southward along the river&#x27;s banks through western Tennessee.
In the Battle of Shiloh, when Confederate forces under General Albert Sydney Johnston surprised Grant&#x27;s troops in southwestern Tennessee near Pittsburg Landing and began pushing them back into the river, &quot;Tyler&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; brought their guns to bear when the Confederates attempted to protect their right flank by anchoring it on the river bank. The two ships delivered a devastating enfilading fire that forced the Southern right flank to fall back. Grant&#x27;s troops took advantage of the withdrawal to mount a general advance supported by naval ordnance. Thus, victory ensued where debacle seemed imminent. Grant said of this battle, &quot;in this repulse much is due to the presence of the gunboats.&quot;

==The Mississippi and Vicksburg==
On 19 April 1862, &quot;Tyler&quot; moved farther south where she captured the Confederate transport &quot;Albert Robb&quot; and burned another Southern ship, &quot;Dunbar&quot;. After Shiloh and the capture of Island No. 10 on the Mississippi, the North shifted the emphasis of its war in the west to conquering that mighty river in an effort to divide the Confederacy in two. Fort Pillow fell on 4 June and Memphis, Tennessee fell on 6 June. Vicksburg, Mississippi was the next obstacle, and it took more than a year to remove it. Those efforts occupied &quot;Tyler&quot; intermittently for the ensuing 13 months. Her first action of the Vicksburg Campaign came in mid-July when she joined the ironclad and the in probing the Yazoo River above Vicksburg in search of the incomplete Confederate ironclad ram CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot; which had eluded capture at Memphis and sought refuge far up the Yazoo. The falling waters of the Yazoo forced &quot;Arkansas&quot; downriver; but, by then, she was virtually complete and ready for battle.

On 15 July, the Union probe and the falling river brought &quot;Tyler&quot; and her colleagues into a collision with &quot;Arkansas&quot;. After a brisk exchange of cannonades, &quot;Carondelet&quot; was disabled. Only &quot;Tyler&quot;, abandoned by &quot;Queen of the West&quot;, remained to suffer the full onslaught of the powerful Southern warship. Recognizing the futility in attacking her adversary unsupported, &quot;Tyler&quot; reluctantly retreated with &quot;Arkansas&quot; in pursuit. After a running fight all the way down the Yazoo, the two warships reached the Union fleet lying near the confluence of the two rivers. &quot;Tyler&quot; sought refuge among the fleet while &quot;Arkansas&quot; ran through it, delivering salvo after salvo into the aggregate of ships, and moored safely under the protection of the Vicksburg shore batteries.

During the first phase of the siege of Vicksburg, &quot;Tyler&quot; participated in the joint Army-Navy expedition up the Yazoo River to establish a landward advance on the Confederate stronghold. That expedition lasted from 7 December 1862 until 3 January 1863. Though the expedition showed no immediate fruits, the land campaign, in conjunction with the waterborne attacks, eventually brought Vicksburg to her knees. In the meantime, &quot;Tyler&quot; saw action in two other operations. The first was to open Arkansas to invasion and the second was in support of the slow strangulation of Vicksburg. In mid-January, she joined other units of the squadron in escorting Army transports to Fort Hindman which guarded Arkansas Post on the invasion route to Little Rock. Federal forces carried that fort finally on 9 January 1863 after a combined sea and land campaign. Following that expedition, the gunboat resumed a patrol routine on the Mississippi until late April.

On the 29th, she joined another expedition up the Yazoo, and it resulted in the fall of the important fortifications on Haynes Bluffs on 1 May. That operation was the gunboat&#x27;s last major role in the reduction of Vicksburg which surrendered to Union forces on 4 July 1863. On 6 Jun 1863, &quot;Tyler&quot; was located near Island 82, Arkansas, on the Mississippi river and under direction of Capt. Picket. &quot;Tyler&quot; received surprise delivery of steamboat &quot;Lady Walton&quot;, originally commandeered by the Confederacy for food transport, but which now flew under a flag of truce. This reception was the result of several Arkansas citizens executing a long-meditated attempt to undermine the Confederacy.

&quot;Tyler&quot; resumed her support for Army troops upriver invading Arkansas. On the day that Vicksburg surrendered, the gunboat brought her guns to bear on an attacking Confederate force near Helena, Arkansas.

==On the White River==
For the remainder of the war, she participated in the invasion of Arkansas, operating principally on the White River. Her last major combat with the Confederates came on 24 June 1864 far up the White River near Clarendon, Arkansas, when she engaged the Southern shore batteries which damaged and captured the gunboat &quot;Queen City&quot;. The beginning of 1865 found her still on the White River but by April she was at Memphis.

==Rescue efforts in the &quot;Sultana&quot; tragedy==
The &quot;Tyler&quot; was pressed into rescue duty with a volunteer crew to assist in the steamboat &quot;Sultana&quot; disaster, north of Memphis on 27 April 1865, as her regular complement had recently been discharged.

In June, &quot;Tyler&quot; moved to Mound City, Illinois where she remained until sold at auction there on 17 August 1865.

<doc id="751537" wikidata="Q7737851" url="?curid=751537" title="The Great Merlini">
<text>The Great Merlini is a fictional detective created by Clayton Rawson. He is a professional magician and amateur detective, who appears in four locked room or impossible crime novels written in the late 1930s and early 1940s, as well as in a dozen short stories.

&quot;His chronicler, free-lance writer Ross Harte, notes that Merlini hates the New York City Subway system, beer, inactivity, opera, golf, and sleep. He is, on the other hand, highly partial to surf bathing, table tennis, puzzles, circuses, and Times Square, where he operates a magic shop. Merlini&#x27;s friendly rival is Inspector Homer Gavigan of Homicide, an intelligent man who is, nonetheless, amazed by the magician&#x27;s feats.&quot;

==Bibliography==
===Novels===
* Death from a Top Hat (1938)
* The Footprints on the Ceiling (1939)
* The Headless Lady (1940)
* No Coffin for the Corpse (1942)

===Short stories===
Twelve short stories featuring Merlini were published in Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine between 1946 and 1971. In 1979, they were collected under the title of &quot;The Great Merlini&quot;.
* The Clue of the Tattooed Man
* The Clue of the Broken Legs
* The Clue of the Missing Motive
* From Another World
* Off the Face of the Earth
* Merlini and the Lie Detector
* Merlini and the Vanished Diamonds
* Merlini and the Sound Effects Murder
* Nothing Is Impossible
* Miracles - All in the Day&#x27;s Work
* Merlini and the Photographic Clue
* The World&#x27;s Smallest Locked Room

==Adaptations==
At least two movies were made based on the Merlini books. One of them, &quot;Miracles for Sale&quot; (1939), was based on &quot;Death from a Top Hat&quot; but had no character named Merlini—instead, Robert Young played &quot;The Great Morgan&quot;. The 1942 movie &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;, starring Lloyd Nolan, was based on &quot;No Coffin for the Corpse&quot;, but the Merlini character was replaced by Michael Shayne, a popular fictional private eye at the time, created by the writer Brett Halliday. Merlini was shown in a brief segment where he advises Shayne, and was played by an uncredited Charles Irwin.

A 30-minute pilot for a television series was directed by Ted Post in 1951, but no further episodes were made. &quot;The Transparent Man&quot;, written by Rawson, starred Jerome Thor as The Great Merlini—who in this incarnation was a stage magician—with Barbara Cook as his assistant Julie and featuring E. G. Marshall as a criminal.

<doc id="751544" wikidata="Q37976" url="?curid=751544" title="Japanese Terrier">
<text>The is a small terrier native to Japan. It is believed to be descended from the progeny of fox terrier types, pointers and indigenous Japanese dogs.

== Appearance ==
The Japanese Terrier most often has a black head and a predominantly white body with little black spots. The length of the Japanese Terrier is anywhere from 8 to 13 inches tall (to shoulders) and it typically weighs 5 to 10 pounds. Its ears are high set and fold forward, and the coat is short, slick and fine. Its tail can be docked.

== Temperament ==
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) breed standard describes this breed as having &quot;a lively and cheerful character&quot; and as &quot;swift and lively in temperament&quot;.

== History ==
The Japanese Terrier was bred in the 17th century by mating Smooth Fox Terriers, brought by Dutch merchant ships to Nagasaki, with small-sized pointers or small native Japanese dogs. By the 1900s, at the end of the Meiji Era, some of these dogs were seen in the Kobe streets, and were called the “Kobe Terriers”. The appearance of these “Kobe Terriers” was like a mix of the modern Smooth Fox Terriers and the Japanese Terriers. The dogs were then kept as lapdogs in other ports such as Kobe and Yokohama. Planned breeding did not begin until around 1920, and the Japanese Terrier was recognized by the Japan Kennel Club in 1930.

The Japanese Terrier was originally bred to hunt small game, such as rats and mice, and to provide companionship to their owners. The breed is known for its high energy and intelligence, making it a great choice for an active owner who is willing to provide plenty of exercise and mental stimulation.
The breed is generally healthy, but can be prone to certain health issues, such as deafness and allergies. Regular veterinary check-ups and proper grooming are important for maintaining the health of the breed.
Overall, the Japanese Terrier is a loyal and loving companion for those who are willing to provide it with the care and attention it needs.

On October 13, 2020, the Japanese Terrier was accepted into the American Kennel Club&#x27;s Foundation Stock Service, an optional breed registry service the club provides for new purebred dog breeds that have been introduced to the US and are yet to be recognised by the AKC.

<text>Keeper of the Keys (1932) is the sixth and last mystery in the Charlie Chan series of Earl Derr Biggers; Biggers was planning on continuing the series, but died in 1933 before he could. The films continued the series for him.

==Plot summary==

Once again, the setting of the novel is rural California, where Chan has been invited as a houseguest. He meets a world-famous soprano, Ellen Landini, who is murdered not too long after the meeting. Chan does not have far to look for suspects—the host is her ex-husband, as are three of the other house guests. Her servants, entourage and husbands all come under suspicion. Once again, Chan is expected to solve the murder, which he does by understanding the key clues—the actions of a little dog named Trouble, two scarves, and two little boxes. When he understands how the murder is committed, he learns the role of elderly house servant Ah Sing—the keeper of the keys.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
This was the only one of Biggers&#x27; Chan novels never to be adapted into a film, while some of the others were used more than once to create films. However, it was adapted into a short-lived Broadway play in 1933, by Valentine Davies, with William Harrigan playing Charlie Chan.

<doc id="751549" wikidata="Q7278604" url="?curid=751549" title="Rabbit Maranville">
<text>Walter James Vincent &quot;Rabbit&quot; Maranville (November 11, 1891 – January 6, 1954) was an American professional baseball shortstop, second baseman and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Robins, and St. Louis Cardinals between 1912 and 1934. At the time of his retirement in 1935, he had played in a record 23 seasons in the National League, a mark which was not broken until 1986 by Pete Rose.

Maranville was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954, mainly on the strength of his defensive abilities.

==Career==
Maranville finished third in the MVP voting in his first full season, playing for the Boston Braves as a 21-year-old in 1913 even though his batting average was just .247 in 143 games with two homers. The following year, Maranville was the runner-up in the MVP voting to teammate Johnny Evers as the Braves won the National League pennant and then went on to sweep the powerful Philadelphia A&#x27;s in the World Series. That year, Maranville was the Braves&#x27; cleanup hitter, despite batting just .246 and hitting four home runs. Following the series, he and several of his teammates went on a vaudeville tour, reenacting plays from the World Series while also singing and telling stories. Maranville was demonstrating a stolen base to an audience in Lewiston, Maine, when he accidentally slid off the edge of the stage and fell onto a drum in the orchestra pit, suffering a broken leg. Maranville played only 11 games in 1918, spending most of the year in the United States Navy during World War I.
Maranville threw and batted right-handed; he stood tall and weighed . Over a lengthy career which spanned both the dead ball and live-ball era, he played for the Boston Braves (1912–1920, 1929–1933, 1935), Pittsburgh Pirates (1921–1924), Chicago Cubs (1925), Brooklyn Robins (1926) and St. Louis Cardinals (1927–1928). He retired having compiled a .258 batting average, 2,605 hits, 1,255 runs, 28 home runs, 884 RBI and 291 stolen bases. As a shortstop, he finished his career with a positional record 5,139 putouts. He moved to second base in 1924 after the Pirates installed Glenn Wright at the shortstop position. He won his only World Series championship in 1914 as a member of the Braves, and won his only other National League championship in 1928 as a member of the Cardinals.

Maranville was known as one of &quot;baseball&#x27;s most famous clowns&quot; due to his practical jokes and lack of inhibitions. He used to don a pair of glasses to make fun of umpires and mimic the actions of hitters or pitchers who took an especially long time to get ready. Other stunts he pulled included throwing firecrackers, stepping out on hotel ledges, and swallowing goldfish. On a road trip to New York, Maranville had teammate Jack Scott cry &quot;Stop, thief!&quot; as Scott chased him through Times Square. Another time, his concerned teammates broke into his hotel room after hearing screams, breaking glass, and gunshots emanating from within, as well as Maranville groaning, &quot;Eddie, you&#x27;re killing me!&quot; An unharmed Maranville and two friends greeted the players like nothing was wrong as they wandered out of the room. When Maranville was appointed manager of the Chicago Cubs in 1925—one of their worst seasons ever—he continued to demonstrate his wild behavior. His only rule with the team was that none of the players could go to bed before he did. One night he walked through a Pullman car, dumping water on sleeping players&#x27; heads, saying, &quot;No sleeping under Maranville management, especially at night.&quot; After 53 games with him as the manager, the Cubs were in last place with a 23–30 record. Not long after that, he was out on the street outside Ebbets Field in Brooklyn mimicking a newsboy hawking papers. He cried out, &quot;Read all about it! Maranville fired!&quot; And so he was—the next day.

1926 was a struggle for Maranville. Having been claimed off waivers by the Brooklyn Robins, he spent the first half of the season with them but was released halfway through the year. The Cardinals signed him that November but assigned him to the Rochester Tribe of the International League in 1927. Maranville realized he would have to make a change in his lifestyle if he wanted to continue playing in the major leagues. &quot;Either I had to lay off the booze and get serious with the game or it would be the end of me.&quot;

On May 24, 1927, Maranville resolved to stop drinking. Later that year, Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey stated, &quot;Walter is a changed man ... it is apparent that he has seen the light ... his change in attitude is remarkable.&quot; Called up by St. Louis at the end of the year, he played in nine games for them in late September before spending all of 1928 on their roster.

Even at age 41, when Maranville batted .218 in 143 games and hit no homers, he finished in a tie for 12th in the 1933 NL MVP voting. He missed the entire 1934 season after breaking his left fibula and tibia in a collision at home plate during an exhibition game. Maranville attempted a comeback in 1935 but was unable to play like he used to.

Following the end of his major league career, Maranville turned to managing, including stints as a minor league manager for Montreal Royals, at Albany, Elmira, and Springfield, Massachusetts. With Elmira in 1936, he served as a player-manager, batting .323 in 123 games.

After managing in the minor leagues, Maranville was employed by youth baseball programs in Detroit and Rochester. Then, he directed a baseball school sponsored by the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; newspaper. He enjoyed working with children and always cautioned them against adopting the same wild lifestyle he had pursued during his earlier career.

==Death and legacy==
Maranville died as the result of a severe heart attack shortly after midnight on January 6, 1954, at his home in Woodside, New York, where death was nearly instantaneous. He was 62 years old. 

Maranville was interred in the Holy Family Section B, Lot 206, Grave 5, of the St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Maranville was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954, six months after his death, along with Bill Terry and Bill Dickey, in his 14th year of eligibility.

<doc id="751563" wikidata="Q1758887" url="?curid=751563" title="Maker's Mark">
<text>Maker&#x27;s Mark is a small-batch bourbon whisky produced in Loretto, Kentucky, by Suntory Global Spirits. It is bottled at 90 U.S. proof (45% alcohol by volume) and sold in squarish bottles sealed with red wax. The distillery offers tours, and is part of the American Whiskey Trail and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.

==History==
Maker&#x27;s Mark&#x27;s origin began when T. William &quot;Bill&quot; Samuels Sr., purchased the Burks&#x27; Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, for $35,000 on October 1, 1953. Production began in 1954, and the first run was bottled in 1958 under the brand&#x27;s dipped red wax seal (U.S. trademark serial number 73526578).

In the 1960s and 1970s, Maker&#x27;s Mark was widely marketed with the tag line, &quot;It tastes expensive ... and is.&quot;

The distillery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974, and designated a National Historic Landmark on December 16, 1980, listed as &quot;Burks&#x27; Distillery&quot;, the first distillery in America to be recognized while the landmark buildings were in active production.

Maker&#x27;s Mark was sold to Hiram Walker &amp; Sons in 1981, which was acquired by the distillery giant Seagram in 1987. In 2001, after Seagram&#x27;s collapse, Allied-Domecq acquired Makers Mark. When Allied-Domecq was bought by Pernod Ricard in 2005, the Maker&#x27;s Mark brand was sold to Deerfield, Illinois–based Fortune Brands. Fortune Brands split in 2011, with its alcoholic beverage business becoming Beam Inc.

After the brand&#x27;s creation by Bill Samuels Sr., its production was overseen by his son Bill Samuels Jr. until 2011 when he announced his retirement as president and CEO at the age of 70. His son Rob Samuels succeeded him in April 2011.

On February 9, 2013, the company sent a mass email announcing a plan to reduce the alcohol strength of the whiskey, citing supply issues as the reason for the change. The result of this change would have been to reduce the product from 90 U.S. proof (45% alcohol by volume) to 84 U.S. proof (42% abv), which would have stretched inventory by about 6%. Maker&#x27;s Mark said that their own tasting panel of distillery employees reported no taste difference in the lower proof, while industry analysts said that the difference would be subtle, and since most drinkers mix the bourbon or serve it on ice, few would be able to notice it. According to Neil Irwin for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s &quot;Wonkblog&quot;, the decision can be explained by Beam&#x27;s desire to keep Maker&#x27;s Mark competitive as a premium bourbon at mid-range bars, and a well drink among high-end bars.
On February 17, the company said that it had reconsidered its decision after receiving a strong negative reaction from customers, and that it would continue to bottle at the original strength. Some overseas markets like Australia will continue to sell the whiskey at 40%.

In January 2014, Beam Inc. announced its sale to Suntory, creating Beam Suntory, the third largest distilled spirits maker in the world. News of the proposed sale included bourbon executives vowing &quot;the product taste won&#x27;t change – and neither will the company&#x27;s historic purity standards.&quot;

In 2014, Maker&#x27;s Mark released a Cask Strength Bourbon in limited quantities initially available to consumers only at their distillery gift shop. Proof fluctuates each batch between 53% and 58% abv. The product was released on the global market in July 2016.

In November 2015 Beam Suntory announced a major expansion of the distillery.

In November 2018, Dave Pickerell, who served as master distiller, died at 62 years old. Pickerell was called the &quot;Johnny Appleseed of American Whiskey&quot;.

In June 2019, the company announced it would begin selling Maker&#x27;s Mark 101, bottled at 101 U.S. proof, at their distillery. The higher proof bourbon was first introduced at duty-free airport shops in 2018.

In May 2024, Maker&#x27;s Mark owner, Beam Suntory, was re-branded as Suntory Global Spirits including the launch of a new website and visual identity.

==About the bourbon==

Maker&#x27;s Mark is unusual in that no rye is used as part of the mash. Instead of rye Maker&#x27;s Mark uses red winter wheat (16%), along with corn (70%) and malted barley (14%) in the mash bill. 

During the planning phase of Maker&#x27;s Mark, Samuels allegedly developed seven candidate mash bills for the new bourbon. As he did not have time to distill and age each one for tasting, he instead made a loaf of bread from each recipe and the one with no rye was judged the best tasting. Samuels also received considerable assistance and recipes from Stitzel-Weller owner Pappy Van Winkle, whose distillery produced the wheated Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller bourbons.

Maker&#x27;s Mark is aged for around six years, being bottled and marketed when the company&#x27;s tasters agree that it is ready. Maker&#x27;s Mark is one of the few distillers to rotate the barrels from the upper to the lower levels of the aging warehouses during the aging process to even out the differences in temperature during the process. The upper floors are exposed to the greatest temperature variations during the year, so rotating the barrels ensures that the bourbon in all the barrels has the same quality and taste.

Maker&#x27;s Mark is marketed as a &quot;small batch&quot; Bourbon. Most producers of so-called small batch Bourbons do not clarify exactly what they mean by the term. The producer of Maker&#x27;s Mark says that the traditional definition is &quot;A bourbon that is produced/distilled in small quantities of approximately 1,000 gallons or less (20 barrels) from a mash bill of around 200 bushels of grain&quot;.

Maker&#x27;s Mark is sold in squarish bottles that are sealed with red wax. T. William Samuels&#x27; wife, Marjorie &quot;Margie&quot; Samuels, gave the whiskey its name, drew its label, and thought up the wax dipping that gives the bottle its distinctive look. It was introduced to the market in 1959.

Three varieties are marketed: the original, bottled at 90 U.S. proof (45% alcohol by volume); a mint julep flavor with green wax on the neck released seasonally in limited amounts; and Maker&#x27;s 46 (47% alcohol by volume), a variety flavored by introducing seared French oak staves into the traditional charred white oak barrel toward the end of its aging. As of 2021, Maker&#x27;s Mark is now available at up to 57% alcohol content (114 proof).
Maker&#x27;s Mark is, along with George Dickel and Old Forester, one of a handful of American-made whiskies that uses the Scottish spelling &quot;whisky&quot; rather than the predominant American &quot;whiskey&quot;.

==Bourbon House &amp; Lounge==

Maker&#x27;s Mark began creating branded restaurants with the October 2004 opening of Maker&#x27;s Mark Bourbon House &amp; Lounge in the Fourth Street Live! entertainment complex in Downtown Louisville, Kentucky. In addition to serving Maker&#x27;s Mark it features bourbons from each of Kentucky&#x27;s distilleries. The menu was designed by Chef Al Paris of the former jazz club Zanzibar Blue restaurant in Philadelphia.

A second such establishment opened in Kansas City, Missouri&#x27;s downtown Power &amp; Light District in 2008, and a third at the Indiana Live Casino in Shelbyville, Indiana just outside Indianapolis in March, 2009.

==Reviews==

Maker&#x27;s Mark bourbon has earned solid marks at international Spirits ratings competitions. Its primary bourbon earned a gold medal at the 2010 San Francisco World Spirit Ratings Competition and a score of 90–95 from Wine Enthusiast in 2007. The Maker&#x27;s Mark 46—which has longer aging and exposure to toasted French oak staves—has earned similar ratings. 

Jane MacQuitty, spirits writer for &quot;The London Times&quot;, said of Maker&#x27;s Mark that &quot;What separates this bourbon from the rest is the softness and smoothness of its rich oak, vanilla and raisiny-like flavours.&quot; Food critic Morgan Murphy said &quot;Dark as its red wax seal, this beautiful whiskey packs apple spice, vanilla, and a front-of-the-mouth crispness that is admired the world over.&quot;

==Limited edition collector&#x27;s sets==

===Keeneland===
Maker&#x27;s Mark began special edition bottles featuring Keeneland bottles for horses in 1997. The label was white with a dark green horse and green wax. Other Keeneland bottles include famous Derby winners such as Secretariat (2003), Seattle Slew (2004), Affirmed (2005), American Pharoah (2016), and Justify (2018).

===University of Louisville===
On July 20, 2012, Maker&#x27;s Mark started selling a limited edition bottle featuring University of Louisville&#x27;s head football coach Charlie Strong. The bottles were created to raise money for a new Academic Center of Excellence on UofL&#x27;s campus. Maker&#x27;s Mark also has marketed special label bottles with the images of Hall of Fame Basketball Coach Rick Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich for the same purpose.

===University of Kentucky===
Maker&#x27;s Mark has featured several University of Kentucky sports personalities on its University of Kentucky (UK) line of limited release bottles. A limited quantity of bottles can be signed for free by the personality that was selected for the bottle and by a member of the Samuels family. The signing party is held at Keeneland horse track in the university&#x27;s home city of Lexington.

The first UK special edition bottle was produced in 1993. In celebration of the 1996 NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Champions, Maker&#x27;s Mark printed a bottle that had a denim background with white type. The team&#x27;s coach at the time, Rick Pitino, signed the bottle.

Other bottles include: Wildcat Bottle (2001), Bill Keightley (2002), Rupp&#x27;s Runts (2006), The Unforgettables (2007), Joe B. Hall (first in 2008 and again in 2016), Rich Brooks (2009), John Calipari (2010), Tim Couch (2012), Dan Issel (2013), Mark Stoops (2014), and Adolph Rupp (2015). The 2015 bottle was the first in a series honoring the five basketball coaches who won NCAA titles at UK; Pitino was honored in 2017 and Tubby Smith in 2018, with Calipari to be honored for a second time in 2019.

<doc id="751580" wikidata="Q3407635" url="?curid=751580" title="Radioisotope rocket">
<text>A radioisotope rocket or radioisotope thermal rocket is a type of thermal rocket engine that uses the heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements to heat a working fluid, which is then exhausted through a rocket nozzle to produce thrust. They are similar in nature to nuclear thermal rockets such as NERVA, but are considerably simpler and often have no moving parts. Alternatively, radioisotopes may be used in a radioisotope electric rocket, in which energy from nuclear decay is used to generate the electricity used to power an electric propulsion system.

The basic idea is a development of existing radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, systems, in which the heat generated by decaying nuclear fuel is used to generate power. In the rocket application the generator is removed, and the working fluid is instead used to produce thrust directly. Temperatures of about are possible in this system, allowing for specific impulses of about 700 to 800 seconds (7 to 8 kN·s/kg), about double that of the best chemical engines such as the LH2-LOX Space Shuttle Main Engine.

However the amount of power generated by such systems is typically fairly low. Whereas the full &quot;active&quot; reactor system in a nuclear thermal rocket can be expected to generate over a gigawatt, a radioisotope generator might get 5 kW. This means that the design, while highly efficient, can produce thrust levels of perhaps , making them useful only for thrusters. In order to increase the power for medium-duration missions, engines would typically use fuels with a short half-life such as polonium-210, as opposed to the typical RTG which would use a long half-life fuel such as plutonium-238 in order to produce more constant power over longer periods of time.

Another drawback to the use of radioisotopes in rockets is an inability to change the operating power. The radioisotope constantly generates heat that must be safely dissipated when it is not heating a propellant. Reactors, on the other hand, can be throttled or shut down as desired.

==Technology development==

TRW maintained a fairly active development program known as Poodle from 1961 to 1965, and today the systems are still often known as Poodle thrusters. The name was a play on the larger systems being developed under Project Rover, which led to NERVA. In April 1965 they ran their testbed engine for 65 hours at about , producing a specific impulse of 650 to 700 seconds (6.5 to 7 kN·s/kg).

==Photon pressure==

Even without an exhaust, the photon pressure of the energy emitted by a thermal source can produce thrust, although an extremely tiny amount. A famous example of spacecraft thrust due to photon pressure was the Pioneer anomaly, in which photons from the onboard radioisotope source caused a tiny but measurable acceleration of the Pioneer spacecraft.

A similar phenomenon occurred on the New Horizons spacecraft; photons (thermal infrared) from the RTG, reflected from the spacecraft&#x27;s antenna, produced a very small thrust which propelled the spacecraft slightly off course.

<doc id="751581" wikidata="Q2429942" url="?curid=751581" title="Adjutant general">
<text>An adjutant general is a military chief administrative officer.

==France==
In Revolutionary France, the was a senior staff officer, effectively an assistant to a general officer. It was a special position for lieutenant-colonels and colonels in staff service. Starting in 1795, only colonels could be appointed to the position. It was supplemented by the rank of in 1800. In 1803 the position was abolished and reverted to the rank of colonel.

==Habsburg Monarchy==

The General Adjutants (generals only) and Wing Adjutants (staff officers only) were used to service the Emperor of the Habsburg Monarchy. The emperor&#x27;s first general aide had a captain or lieutenant as an officer. Traditionally, the Wing Adjutants did their regular service. From the various branches of the Imperial Army, diligent military personnel were selected and given to the Emperor for election. 

The adjutants were then assigned to the emperor in their two to three-year service, formed his constant accompaniment, regulated and monitored the daily program and audiences, and were responsible for the personal file run between the war ministry and the emperor. The service with Emperor Franz Joseph I began for the wing adjutants at three in the morning in full gear because the emperor got up very early. After the imperial breakfast, the adjutant reported to the emperor and presented current reports and the daily program. The service with the emperor was considered very exhausting.

Even today, the head of the House of Habsburg has an adjutant general to assist him with official appointments.

==United Kingdom==
For over 250 years the Adjutant-General to the Forces was one of the most senior officers in the British Army. He was responsible for developing the Army&#x27;s personnel policies and supporting its people. Since 2016 the Adjutant-General has been renamed Commander Home Command with different responsibilities.

==United States==

In the United States, there are three definitions of this term:
#The chief administrative officer of the United States Army, who is subordinated to the Army Chief of Staff, and works directly for the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-1, or ACS, G-1 (formerly known as the Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel, or DCSPER). Formerly a major general position, as of 1984 it is a brigadier general billet. This officer is head of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps and is responsible for the procedures affecting awards and decorations, as well as casualty operations, and for the administration and preservation of records of all army personnel.
#The chief administrative officer of a major military unit, such as a division, corps, or army. This officer is normally subordinated to the unit chief of staff and is known as the G-1. Although they are called the Adjutant General, they are almost never a general officer and the General part is likely referencing the G in G-1 standing for General Staff.
#The senior military officer of a state&#x27;s, commonwealth&#x27;s, or territory&#x27;s military forces, including the National Guard (Army National Guard and Air National Guard), the naval militia, and any state defense forces. This officer is known as the &quot;AG&quot; or the &quot;TAG&quot; and reports to the state&#x27;s chief executive when the National Guard is not in a &quot;federalized&quot; status under Title 10 USC.

==Imperial Russia==
In Imperial Russia, the &quot;Adjutant general&quot; () was an assistant who attended the Tsar, a field marshal, admiral or a general.

<text>William &quot;Bill&quot; Moriarty (1890, London, United Kingdom – April 14, 1936) was a Canadian Communist and Right Oppositionist. He was general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada from 1921 to 1923.

Moriarty was born in England and became a trade unionist working as a tin miner in Cornwall, a railway worker and then a miner in Wales. He moved to Canada in 1912 and worked first as a harvest worker. He joined the Socialist Party of Canada becoming involved in its left wing and was one of the founding members of the Communist Party of Canada and was elected to the Central Executive Committee at its founding convention May 1921 and was the first general secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Canada which was the legal wing of the underground Communist Party. He remained one of the leading members of the Communist Party throughout the 1920s and was elected to the executive of the Communist International in 1925. He was expelled from the party in 1930 as a supporter of the &quot;Right Opposition&quot;, pro-Bukharin, Jay Lovestone current in the Comintern.

He founded the Toronto-based Marxian Educational League which was a branch of Lovestone&#x27;s Communist Party (Opposition) and the International Communist Opposition. The M.E.L. affiliated with the Ontario CCF in 1933. He was the M.E.L.&#x27;s delegate at the national Cooperative Commonwealth Federation convention that drafted the Regina Manifesto in 1933. Moriarty remained a member of Lovestone&#x27;s international tendency until his death in 1936.

<doc id="751597" wikidata="Q7069575" url="?curid=751597" title="Number of Westminster MPs">
<text>Over the history of the House of Commons, the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) has varied for assorted reasons, with increases in recent years due to increases in the population of the United Kingdom. There are currently 650 constituencies, each sending one MP to the House of Commons, corresponding to approximately one for every 92,000 people, or one for every 68,000 parliamentary electors.

While the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition governing after the 2010 general election had initially planned to reduce the number of MPs and constituencies to 600 during its term of office, Parliament voted in January 2013 to delay the boundary review this change would require. Section 6 of the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 required that the next review report come by October 2018; that was done, but the delays continued. The overall measure was not implemented and later abrogated with the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020, from which the redrawn boundaries will be based and implemented ahead of the 2024 United Kingdom general election. The new boundary reviews were submitted on 28 June 2023.

== History ==
In the 16th century there were around 310 members of parliament, including representation at various points from Calais and Wales.

In 1654 the First Protectorate Parliament included elected representation from Scotland and Ireland. After the Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659 the Scottish and Irish members disappeared from Westminster until the unions of 1707 and 1801 respectively.

In 1654 England and Wales saw its first systematic redistribution of parliamentary seats ever. However, in 1659 the representation of England and Wales reverted to the pre-Civil War pattern. When the Rump Parliament was recalled, later the same year, and the full Long Parliament was reinstated the following year its composition was exactly the same as before the Protectorate.

Only three new English constituencies, with a total of six seats, were enfranchised between the restoration of King Charles II in 1660 and the Reform Act 1832. As many of the constituencies were rotten boroughs, which had either decayed into insignificance centuries ago or had never been important settlements, whereas some major towns only participated in elections as part of the historical county they were situated in, the state of representation was very imperfect. By the Glorious Revolution of 1688 there were 513 MPs, until the Act of Union 1707 added 45 MPs for Scotland. (A total of 48 Scottish constituencies were able to return members, but six small counties were arranged in an alternating scheme whereby only three would return a member at each election, giving a total of 45 MPs). These 558 were again increased to 658 by the Act of Union 1800, with the addition of MPs for Ireland.

Over the next 85 years the number of seats varied only slightly, as constituencies were disenfranchised for corruption and the seats were re-allocated some time later (see the lists below for details). The major redistributions of constituencies following the Reform Act 1832 and Reform Act 1867 both created a new House (elected in 1832 and 1868 respectively) with exactly 658 seats. The number of MPs had dropped to 648 by the dissolution before the general election of 1885.

With the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, introduced in the wake of the Reform Act 1884, the size of the House was increased to 670 and remained unchanged until the Representation of the People Act at the end of the First World War.

The period between 1918 and 1922 saw the most MPs in the history of Parliament with 707 seats.

From 1922 the number of seats has fluctuated between 615 and 659. Unlike the position in many countries, such as the United States and Australia, seats are not allocated to different parts of the United Kingdom by a strict mathematical formula. The total number of seats result from the decisions of the four national Boundary Commissions, each applying the rules from time to time provided for by Parliament.

Up to the fifth general review of parliamentary boundaries, the usual effect of the interaction of the rules applied by the four national boundary commissions was to over-represent the non-English parts of the United Kingdom compared to England. The number of seats in each redistribution also tended to rise (although Northern Ireland was under represented between 1922 and 1983 as for most of that time it had a devolved government and from the 2005 redistribution Scotland used the same quota of average number of electors per constituency as England as it now has devolved institutions).

The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, amended the rules. For the first time the total number of members of parliament was to be fixed (at 600) and a mathematical formula was prescribed for apportioning seats between the four parts of the United Kingdom. As a result of the new legislation, the sixth general review of parliamentary boundaries commenced. The four national boundary commissions agreed on the apportionment of seats. They had a statutory duty to produce a final report on the review by 1 October 2018, but it was not submitted for approval and never implemented at all in 2019, with Parliament and the commissions keeping the 650 seats and the boundaries as drawn before 2010. For the next election, scheduled for 2024, the newly redrawn constituency boundaries and recommendations, whose process began in January 2021, are expected to be reported no later than June 2023.

=== Number of MPs since 1654 ===
The numbering of Parliaments in the table below related to the Protectorate Parliaments (1654–59), the Parliaments of Great Britain (1707–1800) and the Parliaments of the United Kingdom (from 1801).

;Notes
*[a] Change came into effect during a Parliament.

== List of constituencies disenfranchised for corruption and re-allocated seats 1821–85 ==
The normal number of members of parliament in this period was 658. Changes took effect on the dissolution of the previous Parliament, unless otherwise indicated.

;Notes
*[a] This change took effect during the Parliament.
*[b] This change took effect at the same time as the redistribution provided for by the Reform Act 1867, so the total membership of the 20th Parliament remained unchanged from the 658 at the dissolution of the 19th Parliament.
*[c] This change took effect during the Parliament. The Macclesfield borough constituency which was disenfranchised on 25 June 1885, should not be confused with the Macclesfield county constituency which was created under the redistribution that took effect at the 1885 United Kingdom general election and held its first election in November or December 1885.

==Number of MPs by country==
Under the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, the Protectorate regime was established by the Instrument of Government which included a redistribution of parliamentary seats in England and Wales. It also authorised the Lord Protector and Council of State to provide for the parliamentary representation of Scotland and Ireland. This arrangement only lasted for a few years and the three components of the Commonwealth reverted to having individual parliaments.

The total number of MPs representing constituencies in different parts of the United Kingdom has been varied by Act of Parliament several times since the Acts of Union 1707. In the tables below the occasions on which the number has been changed, and the number of MPs following the change is given in each case. The dates given are those when the change took effect. More details of minor changes in the 1821–85 period are set out in the section above.

Monmouthshire is treated as part of Wales throughout this section, although it was sometimes considered to be an English county before the twentieth century. The number of members of parliament representing the county (including borough constituencies within it) was (1654–1885) three, (1885–1918) four and (1918–83) six.

Notes:
* [a] Third Protectorate Parliament.
* [b] Rump Parliament/Long Parliament restored.
* [c] Changes in June 1885.
* [d] Changes at the 1885 United Kingdom general election, in November–December 1885.

* 1948: 71
* 1983: 72
* 2003: 59

In 2003, following the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the Boundary Commission for Scotland met to recommend a decrease in the number of Scottish MPs. This change came into effect following the May 2005 general election.

<doc id="751619" wikidata="Q2740175" url="?curid=751619" title="Restless (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>&quot;Restless&quot; is the 22nd episode and season finale of season four of the supernatural drama television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003), and the 78th episode of the series overall. The episode was written and directed by the show&#x27;s creator Joss Whedon and originally aired on The WB in the United States on May 23, 2000.

The premise of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; is that an adolescent girl, Buffy Summers, is chosen by mystical forces and given superhuman powers to kill vampires, demons, and other evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. She is supported by a close circle of family and friends, nicknamed the Scooby Gang. &quot;Restless&quot; centers on the dreams of the four main characters after enduring an exhausting fight in the previous episode. The dreams are used to comment on the characters—their fears, their past and their possible future. Consistent with each dream is the presence of the First Slayer who hunts and kills them one by one until, in the final sequence, she is confronted and disempowered by Buffy.

The episode serves as a coda to the fourth season instead of a climax, as Whedon wanted to achieve something different for a season finale. Whedon experimented with several filming techniques to make the episode as dreamlike as possible. The episode also foreshadows upcoming events, most notably the first appearance of Buffy&#x27;s sister Dawn. &quot;Buffy&quot; scholar Nikki Stafford calls the surrealistic episode &quot;unprecedented in television&quot;, saying it is &quot;so jam-packed with information that we&#x27;ll probably be seeing allusions to it for the rest of the series&quot;, and referring to it as a &quot;mysterious lead-in to the emotionally turbulent season five&quot;. &quot;Restless&quot; received high praise from critics upon airing, particularly for its character development, visual direction, and wit. It is frequently noted as one of the best episodes of the series.

==Background==
In the series, Buffy Summers is a teenager who, at the age of fifteen, was chosen by mystical forces to be the latest &quot;Slayer&quot;, a girl endowed with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces. After moving with her mother, Joyce (Kristine Sutherland), to the fictional town of Sunnydale, she befriends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), who join her in the struggle against evil. They are guided by Buffy&#x27;s &quot;Watcher&quot;, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is well-versed in demonology and is responsible for Buffy&#x27;s training as a Slayer. The group collectively refer to themselves as the Scooby Gang. During season two, Willow begins to experiment with magic, eventually becoming a formidable witch.

Each season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (often simplified as &quot;Buffy&quot;) presents an overall story arc which episodes tie into, as well as a specific manifestation of evil known as the Big Bad. As noted by &quot;Buffy&quot; scholar Roz Kaveney, episodes in the fourth season address authority, order, and the estrangement from the self and others as Buffy and her friends take on new roles after high school.

Season four begins with Buffy and Willow starting college, attending U.C. Sunnydale, while Xander works at a series of odd jobs and begins dating Anya Jenkins (Emma Caulfield), who lived for 1,100 years as a vengeance demon before losing her powers and getting stuck in the body of a teenager. In the fourth season, Willow becomes romantically involved with fellow-student Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), an experienced witch. The Big Bad in season four is the result of the work of a covert military force called &quot;The Initiative&quot; who are capturing and performing experiments on vampires and demons in Sunnydale. Buffy and her friends discover that chief amongst these experiments is the creation of a human-cyber-demonoid hybrid known as Adam (George Hertzberg), whose programming has gone terribly wrong, leading him to wreak havoc on the town. Buffy&#x27;s challenge is to find a way to disempower him, something she and the Scoobies achieve in the penultimate episode of season four, &quot;Primeval&quot;. In order to do this, the four magically join their essences together to create a single &quot;super Slayer&quot;; while the others perform a ritual, Buffy confronts and defeats Adam while mystically empowered with Giles&#x27; mind, Xander&#x27;s heart, and Willow&#x27;s spirit aiding her. The ritual employs four tarot-like cards: &quot;Manus&quot; (meaning hands or strength) represents Buffy, &quot;Sophus&quot; (meaning teacher or wise) represents Giles, &quot;Animus&quot; (meaning courage, or heart) represents Xander, and &quot;Spiritus&quot; (meaning spirit and magical power) represents Willow. These symbols will become relevant to the central motif in each of the episode&#x27;s four dream sequences.

==Plot==
Following their victory over Adam; Buffy, Xander, Willow, and Giles meet at Buffy&#x27;s to relax with movies, including &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. They quickly fall asleep and are each confronted by the First Slayer in their dreams.

Willow&#x27;s dream opens with Willow painting Sappho&#x27;s love poem, Hymn to Aphrodite, in Greek onto Tara&#x27;s back. She then finds herself on the Sunnydale High school stage, about to perform in a radically changed &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, with Riley playing a cowboy, Buffy as a flapper and Harmony (a popular girl in high school who snubbed Willow, and who became a vampire at the end of Season 3) goofily trying to bite Giles&#x27; neck. Willow realizes with increasing uneasiness that she knows neither her lines nor her role. Buffy then takes Willow to stand in front of a classroom in the same nerdy clothes she wore in &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot; and &quot;The Harvest&quot; at the beginning of the series. Xander mocks her as she nervously begins to read her book report. Oz and Tara—Willow&#x27;s ex-boyfriend and current girlfriend—flirt with each other while watching Willow recite. Suddenly, Willow is attacked and has the life sucked out of her by the First Slayer.

Xander&#x27;s dream begins when he wakes on Buffy&#x27;s couch. After excusing himself to use the restroom, he finds himself the object of an attempted seduction by Joyce. In the restroom, he starts to unzip, then realizes that the bathroom is attached to a large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike – unaffected by daylight – tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they invite him to join them. He tries to do so, only to end up in the basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but who suddenly switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz. Throughout the sequence Xander finds himself in his basement again and again, chased by an unseen pursuer, who is revealed as the First Slayer when she tears his heart out.

Giles&#x27; dream begins with Giles swinging a watch in front of Buffy. They are in Giles&#x27; apartment, which has been stripped of furniture but for a chair and a bed. She laughs, and Giles&#x27; dream cuts to a family scene with Buffy and his girlfriend Olivia at a fairground. Quicker than the others to understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker. He breaks into song, giving suggestions on how to deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage to trace a wiring fault. He begins to realize his pursuer is the First Slayer, just as she scalps him.

In the final dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds herself in her room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, who lives in the walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been promoted to Surgeon General and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy&#x27;s living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.

After they wake up, the four of them then discuss the significance of having tapped into the power of the First Slayer, and Buffy privately recalls Tara&#x27;s words from her dream as she looks into her bedroom.

==Production and writing==
Previous seasons of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; had ended with an action episode which tied up all the threads of the season&#x27;s main plot line, but series creator Joss Whedon wanted to end season four differently. The penultimate episode, &quot;Primeval&quot;, had concluded the Initiative storyline, but Whedon felt the season&#x27;s overall story arc had not been as cohesive as it could have been, and therefore chose to create an episode to act as a &quot;grace note&quot; to the season, an episode which would comment on each of the four main characters and what they had just been through. While talking about the writing of the episode, Whedon said it had been like writing poetry, a process he found &quot;liberating and strange&quot;. Like the earlier &quot;Hush&quot; — an episode with almost no dialogue — he viewed the episode as an exercise in form and writing, and what it means to write. The episode has no real structure, which was a departure for Whedon, as everything he had written before was constructed before even starting the script. Yet despite its fragmented style, the episode unfolds coherently in four discrete acts, each act comprising one character&#x27;s dream.

===Filming techniques===

Whedon used a variety of cinematographic techniques to achieve the dreamlike quality of &quot;Restless&quot;. He used tracking shots with a Steadicam to follow the characters from place to place, creating a flow in the way of real dreams, where there are no logical connections between places and things. In Giles&#x27; dream, he walks from a carnival grounds into Spike&#x27;s crypt, then through a corridor and straight into The Bronze, three locations not related to one another. Whedon was able to do this by simply having actor Anthony Stewart Head walk through the sets as they were built; this effortlessly created a sense of dreamlike dislocation. Another example of this occurs when, in Xander&#x27;s dream, he walks from the front of the moving ice cream van towards the back, crawls up and over some boxes, through a window, and drops into his basement. In the theater scene during Willow&#x27;s dream, a Frazier lens was used to provide a large depth of field, allowing both the foreground and background to be in focus at the same time, while in Xander&#x27;s dream, as he moves from room to room in Buffy&#x27;s house to the university dorm rooms, Whedon used a 17 mm lens to give a sense of motion as the camera passes by walls. Whedon also used unusual framing for shots, often leaving much of the frame empty, with a character being placed near the bottom or off to the side. The scenes in Spike&#x27;s crypt, part of Giles&#x27; dream, were shot in black-and-white to emphasize that Spike is seen as &quot;an old 30s movie villain&quot;.
The outdoor scene in which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was intentionally overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander&#x27;s dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites &quot;The Limey&quot; as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to give a sense of stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked as though she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.

Dynamic editing contributed to the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from close-up to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy&#x27;s dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander&#x27;s dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters&#x27; disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially &quot;The Limey&quot; and &quot;The Underneath&quot;. He also listed Orson Welles&#x27; version of &quot;The Trial&quot; and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.

===Cast===
Besides the main cast, the episode features several appearances by returning and currently recurring characters, mostly within the dream sequences.
* Seth Green, who left the series earlier in the season, makes a brief appearance as Oz in Willow&#x27;s dream.
* Armin Shimerman, whose character Principal Snyder was killed off in the season three finale, appears as Kurtz in the &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; scene. Media analyst Matthias Kuzina observed that the character of Snyder, a &quot;former minion of evil&quot;, is &quot;an almost perfect reincarnation&quot; of Kurtz.
* Amber Benson appears as Tara in the dream sequences, as both Willow&#x27;s girlfriend and a spirit guide to Buffy. Whedon commented on her appearances in Buffy&#x27;s dream: &quot;The idea that Tara would be her spirit guide made sense because she didn&#x27;t have that particular relationship with Tara, and Tara has a kind of good Wiccan mystical energy.&quot;
* George Hertzberg appears as Adam, although in human form rather than in the demon/cyborg makeup he had appeared in throughout the season.
* Mercedes McNab appears as Harmony Kendall, and is present during Willow&#x27;s dream as both an ordinary classmate and an inept vampire.
* Phina Oruche appears as Olivia in Giles&#x27;s dream heavily pregnant and pushing a baby stroller.
* Kristine Sutherland appears as Joyce Summers, Buffy&#x27;s mother. Whedon enjoyed that she got &quot;to play just completely sexy [in Xander&#x27;s dream], because when you play the mom on a show you&#x27;re sort of relegated to momhood, so it was nice to see that side of her.&quot;

It was during the filming of this episode that Michelle Trachtenberg, who would go on to play Buffy&#x27;s sister Dawn in season five, first visited the set. Sarah Michelle Gellar had worked with her previously and suggested to Joss Whedon that she read for the part of Dawn.

===Music===
In Giles&#x27; dream, actor Anthony Stewart Head sings &quot;The Exposition Song&quot;; this was the third time he sang during the season. The song was written by Joss Whedon, arranged by composer Christophe Beck, and performed by Four Star Mary. Beck appears in the scene playing the piano, while members of Four Star Mary play the other instruments. From seasons two to four of the series, Four Star Mary were the real band behind character Oz&#x27;s fictional band, Dingoes Ate My Baby.

==Analysis==
Each dream acts as a character study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed is directly related to the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character&#x27;s essence. Willow&#x27;s card had been &quot;Spiritus&quot;, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander&#x27;s card had been &quot;Animus&quot;, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card &quot;Sophus&quot;, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy&#x27;s card, &quot;Manus&quot;, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.

In Willow&#x27;s dream she has an intimate conversation with her girlfriend Tara while painting a Sapphic love poem on her bare back. She talks about her unwillingness to leave Tara&#x27;s dorm room, a place of comfort and security, but finds herself at college anyway. She struggles to find her place in a bizarre school theater production, apparently &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, while her friends and classmates are fully costumed, prepared, and ready to go on stage. Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are notably less intelligent but instinctively understand the strange idiosyncratic rules. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her &quot;costume&quot;, a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously at the front of the class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz flirtily whispers into Tara&#x27;s ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.

Whedon stated that the maze of red curtains on the stage in Willow&#x27;s dream are not a direct homage to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, as some have posited, but rather represent the safety and comfort of being with Tara, and are a sexual metaphor as well.

The main theme of Xander&#x27;s dream is his sense of failure and of being left behind as his friends move ahead in life. His fear that he is stuck is reiterated throughout his dream by his inability to escape his basement bedroom in his parents&#x27; home, and also escape from his parents&#x27; way of life–argumentative and neglectful. No matter where his dream takes him, he ends up back in the basement. He also struggles to understand and feel comfortable with his sexuality, heavily idealizing and sexualizing Joyce, Willow and Tara and seeing Anya, his girlfriend, as distant and impenetrable and Buffy, who he still has a lingering crush on, as a little girl playing in a sandpit who calls him her &#x27;big brother&#x27;. As the only one of the Scoobies not in college, he feels anxiety about his ability to understand and keep up with ideas and conversations, a fear which is realized when he goes to the university, a place he already feels excluded from, and finds that he cannot understand what people say to him. Aware that he is being chased and is in danger, he asks Giles what is happening but cannot understand his answer, nor what Anya says to him, as they are both inexplicably speaking French. He exclaims, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand!&quot; During his dream both Buffy and Willow tell him, &quot;I&#x27;m way ahead of you,&quot; and Giles tells him &quot;the others have gone on ahead,&quot; underscoring his fear that this is really the case.

Giles&#x27; dream presents a choice: either to remain a father figure and Watcher to Buffy, or to begin his own life, represented by the presence of his girlfriend Olivia, who pushes an empty baby stroller. During this part of his dream, Buffy is dressed as a child, with pigtails, and is unable to throw a ball straight without his help and instruction, an indication of his fear that she will be unable to do her job without his guidance. Later, Olivia is seen weeping, while the baby stroller has been overturned and abandoned, signifying elements of his unfulfilled life, such as marriage and children. Later, in The Bronze, he is explaining the reason they are all being stalked and attacked, performing his job as Watcher, but his singing this information represents his unfulfilled longing to be a musician, something he&#x27;s been exploring privately throughout the season.

The major theme of Buffy&#x27;s dream is her fear of the personal cost of her life as a Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into as a result of his alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.

All of the many elements in the dream sequences have meaning, with the exception of the Cheese Man. Whedon explains: &quot;...the Cheese Man—meaningless. Why? Because I needed something in the show that was meaningless, because there is always something in the dream that doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all. In this case it was the Cheese Man. He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning. This to me means that we&#x27;re being successful, because this means they&#x27;re not worried about everything else, which means they sort of did understand most other things.&quot;

===Foreshadowing===
Buffy&#x27;s dream includes several references to past and future episodes. In a dream sequence in the season three finale, Faith says &quot;Little Miss Muffet counting down from 7-3-0&quot;; foreshadowing Dawn&#x27;s arrival two years later in season five. This number appears (as 7:30) on a clock in Buffy&#x27;s dream in &quot;Restless&quot;. Buffy says, &quot;It&#x27;s so late.&quot; Tara replies, &quot;Oh... that clock&#x27;s completely wrong.&quot; A year has now passed, making the previous number of days to her arrival incorrect. When Buffy leaves the room, Tara tells her, &quot;Be back before Dawn.&quot; The character Dawn appears in the next episode. Tara&#x27;s words to Buffy, &quot;You think you know what&#x27;s to come, what you are. You haven&#x27;t even begun.&quot; are repeated by Dracula to Buffy in the following episode (&quot;Buffy vs. Dracula&quot;). In Xander&#x27;s dream, Giles and Spike swing together on a swing set, with Spike wearing a tweed jacket. Giles comments, &quot;Spike&#x27;s like a son to me.&quot; In &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; (season six), when the characters lose their memories, Spike wears the same tweed jacket and believes Giles is his father.

==Reception==
The episode received critical praise and is often included on lists of the best episodes of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; list of the 25 best Whedonverse episodes—including episodes from &quot;Buffy&quot;, as well as &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;Dollhouse&quot;—&quot;Restless&quot; placed at #20, where they called it &quot;Visually lush and trippy,&quot; and said, &quot;...it reestablished that this genre show was really and truly a deeply affecting character drama with a delightfully bent sense of humor.&quot; At Syfy.co.uk, the episode was listed as the seventh best episode in their list of the top 10 &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes, saying &quot;This surreal episode marks the show&#x27;s turning point, as it moved from a very well-executed urban fantasy drama series to something more creative, more thoughtful, and more surprising than pretty much anything else on television.&quot; In &quot;The Futon Critic&quot;″s list of the 20 best episodes of 2000, the episode was placed at #1, with the author calling it an even more daring episode than &quot;Hush&quot;, another acclaimed episode from the fourth season. In other publications lists of the best &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes, &quot;Restless&quot; placed at #7 by &quot;/Film&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, and &quot;Vox&quot;, #6 by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, #5 by &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, and #4 by &quot;TVLine&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the fourth-best episode of the series, calling it &quot;one of the boldest, most daring and most enigmatic episodes&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s hilarious and fascinating, beautiful and moving, an exhibition in surrealist television.&quot;

At Slayage.com, the Online Journal of &quot;Buffy&quot; Studies, author Daniel Erenberg placed the episode as the second best of the series; stating that the episode &quot;lends itself to infinite interpretations. No one watches it the same way. That&#x27;s the mark of a true masterpiece.&quot; When Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewed &quot;Restless&quot; in 2009, after beginning his first look at the series in 2008, he praised Joss Whedon&#x27;s ability to represent what dreams are actually like. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; also included &quot;Restless&quot; as an &quot;essential episode&quot; of the series in their list of the best TV series of the 2000s, in which &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; placed at #25. &quot;Restless&quot; was listed at #10 in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s list of &quot;21 TV episodes that do dream sequences right&quot;, commenting, &quot;This device allows for a lot of surreal images and moments of weird comedy&quot; and that &quot;there are also some striking, unsettling touches that have the indefinable power and strangeness of a real dream.&quot; The episode was listed as #1 in Daily Kos&#x27; list of the top 10 episodes of the series, and the episode was listed as the second best episode featuring dream sequences by &quot;USA Today&quot;. In series creator Joss Whedon&#x27;s own list of his favorite episodes, he includes &quot;Restless&quot;, saying &quot;Most people sort of shake their heads at it. It was different, but not pointless.&quot;

In 2001, the episode received two nominations for the Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Awards, for Best Contemporary Makeup in a Series and Best Contemporary Hair Styling in a Series.

In its original broadcast on May 23, 2000, on The WB, the episode received 4.5 million viewers according to Nielsen ratings.

<doc id="751624" wikidata="Q656982" url="?curid=751624" title="Bad Cannstatt">
<text>Bad Cannstatt, also called Cannstatt (until July 23, 1933) or Kannstadt (until 1900), is one of the outer stadtbezirke, or city boroughs, of Stuttgart in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Bad Cannstatt is the oldest and most populous of Stuttgart&#x27;s boroughs, and one of the most historically significant towns in the area of Stuttgart. The town is home to the Cannstatter Wasen and Cannstatter Volksfest beer festivals, the MHPArena (VfB Stuttgart), the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle, and the Porsche-Arena.

==Name==

Bad Cannstatt&#x27;s name originates from a &quot;Castra stativa&quot;, Cannstatt Castrum, the massive Roman Castra that was erected on the hilly ridge in AD 90 to protect the valuable river crossing and local trade. In the past, Bad Cannstatt has been known as simply Cannstatt or &quot;Kannstatt&quot;, &quot;Cannstadt&quot;, &quot;Canstatt&quot;, &quot;Kanstatt&quot;, and &quot;Condistat&quot;. Its name was changed to include &quot;Bad&quot; () to mention the town&#x27;s spas on 23 July 1933. 

== History ==
Bad Cannstatt lies on the Neckar at the convergence of various regional trails.
The area was inhabited by the Seelberg mammoth hunters during the last glacial period.
The town was founded during the Roman period, records survive of Roman knowledge of the area&#x27;s springs. The nearby Sielberg is notable for its caverns and fossils. 

In 746 Carloman, Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, called a council at Cannstatt, arrested and executed virtually all nobles of the Alemanni. This marks the transfer of power from the Alemanni to the emerging Carolingians. The present name first appeared as the seat of a court held by Charlemagne in the 8th century while trying the rebellious dukes of Alemannia and Bavaria. 

Cannstatt was the capital of the county of Württemberg into the 14th or 15th century; the Rotenberg was the location of the ruling house&#x27;s ancestral castle. Cannstatt subsequently formed part of the duchy, electorate, and kingdom of Württemberg. It lay about from Stuttgart proper, although it has since grown to include Bad Cannstatt. In the 13th or 14th century, Louis the Bavarian expanded its rights and privileges to equality with Esslingen. Its 15th-century cathedral was dedicated to St Uffo. In 1755, the Great Lisbon earthquake caused the town hall to subside about . During the wars which followed the French Revolution, the town was the site on 21 July 1796 of a French victory over the Austrian Empire.

In the 19th century, it boasted an attractive town hall, a royal theater, a market house, the Wilhelma and Rosenstein palaces, and extensive industry including wool-spinning, dyeing, steelmaking, and construction of machinery. There were then about 40 mineral springs, which were considered beneficial for &quot;dyspepsia and weakness of the nervous system&quot;, as well as &quot;diseases of the throat&quot;. Cannstatt was the site of Gottlieb Daimler&#x27;s invention of the first petroleum-fueled automobile in 1886 and housed an automotive factory before the First World War. Around that time, it also had notable railway and chemical works and a brewery. Cannstatt was incorporated into Stuttgart in 1904.

Of the 19 surviving mineral springs, 11 are recognized as state wells. In the world, it is now second to only Újbuda in Budapest, Hungary, in scale. The Mombach spring is the only one that releases its water without pressure in large quantities; its outflow is used in the adjacent baths and the Wilhelma spa.

==Famous residents==
Famous people associated with Bad-Cannstatt include:

<doc id="751632" wikidata="Q13386" url="?curid=751632" title="Lecce">
<text>Lecce (; ) is city in southern Italy and former capital of the province of Lecce, with the highest population in Italy. It is on the Salentine Peninsula, at the heel of the Italian Peninsula, and is over two thousand years old.

Because of its rich Baroque architecture, Lecce is nicknamed &quot;The Florence of the South&quot;. &quot;Lecce stone&quot;—a particular kind of limestone—is one of the city&#x27;s main exports, because it is very soft and workable, and thus suitable for sculptures. Lecce is also an important agricultural centre, chiefly for its olive oil and wine production, as well as an industrial centre specializing in ceramics.

Lecce is home to the University of Salento.

== History ==
According to legend, a city called &quot;Sybar&quot; existed at the time of the Trojan War, founded by the Messapii. It was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, receiving the new name of &quot;Lupiae&quot;.

Under the emperor Hadrian (2nd century AD) the city was moved to the northeast, taking the name of Licea or Litium. Lecce had a theater and an amphitheater and was connected to the Hadrian Port (the current San Cataldo). Orontius of Lecce, locally called Sant&#x27;Oronzo, is considered to have served as the city&#x27;s first Christian bishop and is Lecce&#x27;s patron saint.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Lecce was sacked by the Ostrogoth king Totila in the Gothic Wars. It was restored to Roman rule in 549, and remained part of the Eastern Empire for five centuries, with brief conquests by Saracens and Lombards.

After the Norman conquest in the 11th century, Lecce regained commercial and political importance (count Tancred of Lecce was the last Norman King of Sicily), flourishing in the subsequent Hohenstaufen and Angevine rule. The County of Lecce was one of the largest and most important fiefs in the Kingdom of Sicily from 1053 to 1463, when it was annexed directly to the crown. From the 15th century, Lecce was one of the most important cities of southern Italy, and, starting in 1630, it was enriched with precious Baroque monuments. To avert invasion by the Ottomans, a new line of walls and a castle were built by Charles V (who was also Holy Roman Emperor), in the first part of the 16th century.

In 1656, a plague broke out in the city, killing a thousand inhabitants.

In 1943, fighter aircraft based in Lecce helped support isolated Italian garrisons in the Aegean Sea during World War 2. Because they were delayed by the Allies, they couldn&#x27;t prevent a defeat. In 1944 and 1945, B-24 long-range bombers of the 98th Heavy Bomber Group attached to the 15th U.S. Army Air Force were based in Lecce, from where the crews flew missions over Italy, the Balkans, Austria, Germany and France.

== Main sights ==

=== Churches and religious buildings ===
* Church of the Holy Cross: construction of the &quot;Chiesa di Santa Croce&quot;) was begun in 1353, but work halted until 1549, and it was completed only by 1695. The church has a richly decorated façade with animals, grotesque figures and vegetables, and a large rose window. Next to the church is the Government Palace, a former convent.
* Lecce Cathedral: the church was originally built in 1144, rebuilt in 1230, then totally restored in the 1659–70 by Giuseppe Zimbalo, who also built the five storey high bell tower, with an octagonal loggia.
* San Niccolò and Cataldo: the church is an example of Italo-Norman architecture. It was founded by Tancred of Sicily in 1180. In 1716 the façade was rebuilt, with the addition of numerous statues, but maintaining the original Romanesque portal. The walls were frescoed during the 15th-17th centuries.
* Celestine Convent: built (1549–1695) in Baroque-style by Giuseppe Zimbalo. The courtyard was designed by Gabriele Riccardi.
* Santa Irene: this church was commissioned in 1591 by the Theatines and dedicated to Saint Irene. The architect was Francesco Grimaldi). It has a large façade showing different styles in the upper and lower parts. Above the portal stands a statue of &quot;Ste Irene&quot; (1717) by Mauro Manieri. The interior is on the Latin cross plan and is rather sober. The main altarpiece is a copy of the &quot;St Michael the Archangel&quot; by Guido Reni. The high altar has a &quot;Transport of the Holy Ark&quot; by Oronzo Tiso. In the right transept is one of the largest altars in Lecce, dedicated to Saint Cajetan (1651). Nearby is the Rococo altar of Saint Andrew Avellino. Also from the mid-17th century is the &quot;Altar of St Orontius&quot; by Francesco Antonio Zimbalo, followed by the altar of Saint Irene with a canvas by Giuseppe Verrio (1639), nine busts of saints housing relics and a large statue of the saint. The altar of Saint Stephen has the &quot;Stoning of St. Stephen&quot; by Verrio.
* San Matteo: this church was built in 1667. It has a typical central Italy Baroque style. It has two columns on the façade, only one of which is decorated, though only partially. According to a local legend, the jealous devil killed the sculptor before he could finish the work.
* Santa Maria degli Angeli
* Santa Chiara: this church was built in 1429–1438, rebuilt in 1687.
* San Francesco della Scarpa: known as the &quot;church without façade&quot; as the latter has been demolished in the 19th century restorations. The most ancient section dates likely to the 13th-14th centuries; the interior is on the Greek Cross plan. Notable are several Baroque altars and a large statue of Saint Joseph.

=== Other buildings ===
* Column of statue of St Oronzo: (Lecce&#x27;s patron) was given to Lecce by the city of Brindisi, because Saint Oronzo was reputed to have cured the plague in Brindisi. The column was one of a pair that marked the end of the Appian Way, the main road between Rome and southern Italy.
* Torre del Parco (&quot;Park Tower&quot;): is one of the medieval symbols of Lecce. It was erected in 1419 by the then-18 year old Giovanni Antonio Del Balzo Orsini, prince of Lecce. The tower, standing at more than , is surrounded by a ditch in which bears (the heraldic symbol of the Orsini del Balzo) were reared. The whole complex was the seat of Orsini&#x27;s tribunal and of a mint, and after Giovanni Antonio&#x27;s death, it became a residence for the Spanish viceroys.
* Palazzo Sedile: was built in 1592 and was used by the local council until 1852.
* Castle of Charles V: built in 1539–49 by Gian Giacomo dell&#x27;Acaja. It has a trapezoidal plan with angular bastions. It is attached to the Politeama Greco Opera House, inaugurated on 15 November 1884.
* Triumphal Arch (&quot;Arco di Trionfo&quot;, commonly called &quot;Porta Napoli&quot;, &quot;Neapolitan Gate&quot;), which is one of the three gates to enter Lecce&#x27;s historical city centre, erected in 1548 in honor of Charles V. It replaced an older gate, &quot;Porta S. Giusto&quot;, which, according to tradition, lay over the tomb of the namesake saint. Also built over pre-existing medieval gates are the current &quot;Porta San Biagio&quot; (&quot;St. Blaise Gate&quot;) and the &quot;Porta Rudiae&quot; which are the other two gates to Lecce&#x27;s Historical city centre. Both are in Baroque style, the latter having the statue of St. Oronzo on the top and mythological figures on the sides.
* Palazzo dei Celestini: now seat of the Province of Lecce. It was built in 1659–95 and designed by Giuseppe Zimbalo.
* The city&#x27;s obelisk: erected in 1822 in honour of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies.


=== Gardens and parks ===
* Orto Botanico di Lecce, a botanical garden.

=== Archaeology ===
* The Roman 2nd century amphitheatre, situated near Sant&#x27;Oronzo Square, was able to seat more than 25,000 people. It is now half-buried because other monuments were built above it over the centuries. The theatre is currently used for various religious and arts events.
* The archaeological museum &quot;Sigismondo Castromediano&quot;.
* The archaeological museum &quot;Faggiano&quot;.
* The archaeological park of Rudiae, three kilometres south-west of the city but within its limits. The place was identified as the former home of the poet Ennius by Antonio de Ferraris, a Renaissance Humanist who was from the region. This was once the more important city until Roman times and has an amphitheatre of its own, a necropolis and remains of substantial walls. The Porta Rudiae, built on the road leading from this site, is named after it.
