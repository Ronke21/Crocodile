<text>The Paunsaugunt Plateau (pronounced &quot;PAWN-suh-gant&quot;) is a dissected plateau, rising to an elevation of , in southwestern Utah in the United States. Located in northern Kane County and southwestern Garfield County, it is approximately wide, and extends southward from the Sevier Plateau approximately , terminating in the Pink Cliffs at the southern end.

It is drained by the East Fork Sevier River which flows northward on the plateau, to the meet the main branch (Sevier River) which flows in a valley along the western side of the plateau. The plateau is highly dissected along the eastern flank, which is drained by the Paria River in the Colorado River watershed, and is protected as Bryce Canyon National Park. A section of the Great Basin Divide is along the plateau, and much of the plateau is part of Dixie National Forest. The plateau receives approximately of snow per year and experiences approximately 200 days of freeze-and-thaw cycles. Utah&#x27;s Highway 12, an All-American Road, crosses the Paunsaugunt Plateau.

Geologically the plateau was created approximately 10–20 million years ago by an uplift on the larger Colorado Plateau. The uplifting caused the formation of joints along the side of the plateau. Subsequent erosive forces, especially along the eastern side in Bryce Canyon National Park, have resulted in the creation of strange rock formations called hoodoos which are the hallmark of the park.

<text>In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.

Mathematically each quantum mechanical system is associated with a separable complex Hilbert space formula_1. A pure state of a quantum system is represented by a non-zero vector formula_2 in formula_1. As the vectors formula_2 and formula_5 (with formula_6) represent the same state, the level of the quantum system corresponds to the dimension of the Hilbert space and pure states can be represented as equivalence classes, or, [[Ray (quantum theory)|rays]] in a projective Hilbert space formula_7. For a two-dimensional Hilbert space, the space of all such states is the complex projective line formula_8 This is the Bloch sphere, which can be mapped to the Riemann sphere.

The Bloch sphere is a unit 2-sphere, with antipodal points corresponding to a pair of mutually orthogonal state vectors. The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors formula_9 and formula_10, respectively, which in turn might correspond e.g. to the spin-up and spin-down states of an electron. This choice is arbitrary, however. The points on the surface of the sphere correspond to the pure states of the system, whereas the interior points correspond to the mixed states. The Bloch sphere may be generalized to an &quot;n&quot;-level quantum system, but then the visualization is less useful.
The natural metric on the Bloch sphere is the Fubini–Study metric. The mapping from the unit 3-sphere in the two-dimensional state space formula_11 to the Bloch sphere is the Hopf fibration, with each ray of spinors mapping to one point on the Bloch sphere.

== Definition ==

Given an orthonormal basis, any pure state formula_12 of a two-level quantum system can be written as a superposition of the basis vectors formula_9 and formula_10, where the coefficient of (or contribution from) each of the two basis vectors is a complex number. This means that the state is described by four real numbers. However, only the relative phase between the coefficients of the two basis vectors has any physical meaning (the phase of the quantum system is not directly measurable), so that there is redundancy in this description. We can take the coefficient of formula_9 to be real and non-negative. This allows the state to be described by only three real numbers, giving rise to the three dimensions of the Bloch sphere.

We also know from quantum mechanics that the total probability of the system has to be one:
:formula_16, or equivalently formula_17.

Given this constraint, we can write formula_12 using the following representation:
:formula_19, where formula_20 and formula_21.

The representation is always unique, because, even though the value of formula_22 is not unique when 
formula_12 is one of the states (see Bra-ket notation) formula_9 or formula_10, the point represented by formula_26 and formula_22 is unique.

The parameters formula_28 and formula_29, re-interpreted in spherical coordinates as respectively the colatitude with respect to the &quot;z&quot;-axis and the longitude with respect to the &quot;x&quot;-axis, specify a point
:formula_30

on the unit sphere in formula_31.

For mixed states, one considers the density operator. Any two-dimensional density operator can be expanded using the identity and the Hermitian, traceless Pauli matrices formula_32,
:formula_33,
where formula_34 is called the Bloch vector.

It is this vector that indicates the point within the sphere that corresponds to a given mixed state. Specifically, as a basic feature of the Pauli vector, the eigenvalues of are formula_35. Density operators must be positive-semidefinite, so it follows that formula_36.

For pure states, one then has
:formula_37

in comportance with the above.

As a consequence, the surface of the Bloch sphere represents all the pure states of a two-dimensional quantum system, whereas the interior corresponds to all the mixed states.

== &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; representation ==
The Bloch vector formula_38 can be represented in the following basis, with reference to the density operator formula_39:

:formula_40
:formula_41
:formula_42

where

:formula_43

This basis is often used in laser theory, where formula_44 is known as the population inversion. In this basis, the numbers formula_45 are the expectations of the three Pauli matrices formula_46, allowing one to identify the three coordinates with x y and z axes.

== Pure states ==
Consider an &quot;n&quot;-level quantum mechanical system. This system is described by an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The pure state space is by definition the set of rays of &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

Theorem. Let U(&quot;n&quot;) be the Lie group of unitary matrices of size &quot;n&quot;. Then the pure state space of &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be identified with the compact coset space
:formula_47

To prove this fact, note that there is a natural group action of U(&quot;n&quot;) on the set of states of &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;. This action is continuous and transitive on the pure states. For any state formula_12, the isotropy group of formula_12, (defined as the set of elements formula_50 of U(&quot;n&quot;) such that formula_51) is isomorphic to the product group

:formula_52

In linear algebra terms, this can be justified as follows. Any formula_50 of U(&quot;n&quot;) that leaves formula_12 invariant must have formula_12 as an eigenvector. Since the corresponding eigenvalue must be a complex number of modulus 1, this gives the U(1) factor of the isotropy group. The other part of the isotropy group is parametrized by the unitary matrices on the orthogonal complement of formula_12, which is isomorphic to U(&quot;n&quot; − 1). From this the assertion of the theorem follows from basic facts about transitive group actions of compact groups.

The important fact to note above is that the &quot;unitary group acts transitively&quot; on pure states.

Now the (real) dimension of U(&quot;n&quot;) is &quot;n&quot;2. This is easy to see since the exponential map
:formula_57
is a local homeomorphism from the space of self-adjoint complex matrices to U(&quot;n&quot;). The space of self-adjoint complex matrices has real dimension &quot;n&quot;2.

Corollary. The real dimension of the pure state space of &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; is 2&quot;n&quot; − 2.

In fact,
:formula_58

Let us apply this to consider the real dimension of an &quot;m&quot; qubit quantum register. The corresponding Hilbert space has dimension 2&quot;m&quot;.

Corollary. The real dimension of the pure state space of an &quot;m&quot;-qubit quantum register is 2&quot;m&quot;+1 − 2.

=== Plotting pure two-spinor states through stereographic projection ===

Mathematically the Bloch sphere for a two-spinor state can be mapped to a Riemann sphere formula_59, i.e., the projective Hilbert space formula_60 with the 2-dimensional complex Hilbert space formula_61 a representation space of SO(3).
Given a pure state 
: formula_62
where formula_63 and formula_64 are complex numbers which are normalized so that 
: formula_65
and such that formula_66 and formula_67,
i.e., such that formula_68 and formula_69 form a basis and have diametrically opposite representations on the Bloch sphere, then let
:formula_70
be their ratio.

If the Bloch sphere is thought of as being embedded in formula_31 with its center at the origin and with radius one, then the plane &quot;z&quot; = 0 (which intersects the Bloch sphere at a great circle; the sphere&#x27;s equator, as it were) can be thought of as an Argand diagram. Plot point &quot;u&quot; in this plane — so that in formula_31 it has coordinates formula_73.

Draw a straight line through &quot;u&quot; and through the point on the sphere that represents formula_69. (Let (0,0,1) represent formula_68 and (0,0,−1) represent formula_69.) This line intersects the sphere at another point besides formula_69. (The only exception is when formula_78, i.e., when formula_79 and formula_80.) Call this point &quot;P&quot;. Point &quot;u&quot; on the plane &quot;z&quot; = 0 is the stereographic projection of point &quot;P&quot; on the Bloch sphere. The vector with tail at the origin and tip at &quot;P&quot; is the direction in 3-D space corresponding to the spinor formula_81. The coordinates of &quot;P&quot; are
:formula_82
:formula_83
:formula_84

== Density operators ==
Formulations of quantum mechanics in terms of pure states are adequate for isolated systems; in general quantum mechanical systems need to be described in terms of density operators. The Bloch sphere parametrizes not only pure states but mixed states for 2-level systems. The density operator describing the mixed-state of a 2-level quantum system (qubit) corresponds to a point &quot;inside&quot; the Bloch sphere with the following coordinates:
:formula_85

where formula_86 is the probability of the individual states within the ensemble and formula_87 are the coordinates of the individual states (on the &quot;surface&quot; of Bloch sphere). The set of all points on and inside the Bloch sphere is known as the &quot;Bloch ball.&quot;

For states of higher dimensions there is difficulty in extending this to mixed states. The topological description is complicated by the fact that the unitary group does not act transitively on density operators. The orbits moreover are extremely diverse as follows from the following observation:

Theorem. Suppose &quot;A&quot; is a density operator on an &quot;n&quot; level quantum mechanical system whose distinct eigenvalues are μ1, ..., μ&quot;k&quot; with multiplicities &quot;n&quot;1, ..., &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;. Then the group of unitary operators &quot;V&quot; such that &quot;V A V&quot;* = &quot;A&quot; is isomorphic (as a Lie group) to
:formula_88

In particular the orbit of &quot;A&quot; is isomorphic to
:formula_89

It is possible to generalize the construction of the Bloch ball to dimensions larger than 2, but the geometry of such a &quot;Bloch body&quot; is more complicated than that of a ball.

== Rotations ==
A useful advantage of the Bloch sphere representation is that the evolution of the qubit state is describable by rotations of the Bloch sphere. The most concise explanation for why this is the case is that the Lie algebra for the group of unitary and hermitian matrices formula_90 is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the group of three dimensional rotations formula_91.

===Rotation operators about the Bloch basis===
The rotations of the Bloch sphere about the Cartesian axes in the Bloch basis are given by

:formula_92

=== Rotations about a general axis ===
If formula_93 is a real unit vector in three dimensions, the rotation of the Bloch sphere about this axis is given by:

:formula_94

An interesting thing to note is that this expression is identical under relabelling to the extended Euler formula for quaternions.

:formula_95

===Derivation of the Bloch rotation generator===
Ballentine presents an intuitive derivation for the infinitesimal unitary transformation. This is important for understanding why the rotations of Bloch spheres are exponentials of linear combinations of Pauli matrices. Hence a brief treatment on this is given here. A more complete description in a quantum mechanical context can be found here.

Consider a family of unitary operators formula_96 representing a rotation about some axis. Since the rotation has one degree of freedom, the operator acts on a field of scalars formula_97 such that:
:formula_98
:formula_99
where formula_100

We define the infinitesimal unitary as the Taylor expansion truncated at second order.
:formula_101

By the unitary condition:
:formula_102

Hence
:formula_103

For this equality to hold true (assuming formula_104 is negligible) we require
: formula_105.
This results in a solution of the form:
:formula_106
where formula_107 is any Hermitian transformation, and is called the generator of the unitary family.
Hence
:formula_108
Since the Pauli matrices formula_109 are unitary Hermitian matrices and have eigenvectors corresponding to the Bloch basis, formula_110, we can naturally see how a rotation of the Bloch sphere about an arbitrary axis formula_111 is described by
:formula_112
with the rotation generator given by formula_113

<text>Eggdrop is a popular IRC bot and the oldest that is still being maintained.

It was originally written by Robey Pointer in December 1993 to help manage and protect the EFnet channel #gayteen; one Eggdrop bot version was named Valis.

Eggdrop was originally intended to help manage and protect channels from takeover attempts.

== Features ==
The bot is written in the C programming language and features interfaces for C modules and Tcl scripts that allow users to further enhance the functionality of the bot.

A large number of Tcl scripts are available to expand the bot&#x27;s functionality, most of them written by Eggdrop users.
Scripts are available to add and extend support for: online games, stats, user and channel management, information storage and lookup, greeting channel members, tracking last seen times, botnet management, anti-spam, file serving and distribution (usually via the DCC protocol), IRC services (similar to ChanServ and NickServ), and much more.

Eggdrop includes built-in support for sharing user information and channel bans. However, a script is required to simultaneously control multiple bots and for bots to coordinate channel management and modes.

The bot also features a &quot;botnet&quot;, which allows multiple bots to be linked together to share data and act in a coordinated fashion. The botnet supports a &quot;party line&quot;, which is accessible via DCC CHAT and Telnet. People can communicate within the botnet on various channels in an equivalent to a miniature IRC. Channel 0, the default, is referred to as the &quot;party line&quot;.

== Popularity ==
Over the years Eggdrop has become one of the most popular bots run by IRC users.

<text>Mount Terror is a mountain of the Cascade Range, located in the northwestern corner of Washington in Whatcom County. The peak is in North Cascades National Park, about south of the Canada–United States border.

Mount Terror is the highest peak of the southern Picket Range. The Pickets, north and south, are considered the most Alpine region of the Cascades. Mount Terror was first climbed in 1932 by William Degenhardt and Herbert Strandberg of the Seattle Mountaineers. Thirty years later Ed Cooper led the first ascent of the more challenging north face.

==Climate==
Mount Terror is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

==Geology==
The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences.

The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago.

During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys is a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

<text>Somali National University (SNU) (, , ) is a national university in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. Its campus grounds were located four kilometers from the Mogadishu International Airport (Aden Adde International Airport). It was established in 1971, but was &quot;officially&quot; founded in 1954. It closed in 1990. After closing down for a number of years, the university reopened in August 2014.

==History==
===General===

The Somali National University was established in 1954 as &quot;Università Nazionale Somala&quot;, under Italian U.N. Trusteeship over Italy&#x27;s former Italian colony in East Africa of Italian Somaliland. In 1960, Somalia became an independent nation in the Trust Territory of Somalia. It obtained official university status in 1969 and the language initially used was only Italian.

In 1983, nine out of the twelve faculties in the Somali National University used Italian as the language of instruction, but after 1990 only Somali and English were used.

The main university grounds were situated about six kilometers from the city center. Here, during the institution&#x27;s first thirty years, the main campus was known as &quot;Jaamacada Gaheyr&quot; (&quot;Gaheyr University&quot;).

In 1973, under the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), programs and facilities were expanded. The SNU developed over the next twenty years into an institution of higher learning, with 13 departments, 700 staff and over 15,000 students.

Under the Somali revolutionary government, the Ministry of Higher Learning and Culture established research centers in a number of cities, with the goal of developing regional economies. These learning centers were earmarked for employees from such ministries as the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Livestock and Forestry Management.

In the mid-1970s, the teaching college of Lafoole University, one of SNU&#x27;s remote campuses, was made a stand-alone institution (&quot;Lafoole Teacher&#x27;s College&quot;). The language of instruction was English.

Due to extensive damage to its facilities as well as the difficulty of holding classes and acquiring books and other necessities in the wake of the civil war in the early 1990s, classes at the university were suspended.

===Language of instruction===
Italian was the Somali National University&#x27;s primary language of instruction. The university&#x27;s main campus was situated in Mogadishu, where residents were already familiar with the Italian language.

From 1973 onward, Somali and English were introduced as additional languages of instruction. All programs at Lafoole College were taught in English. Across the country, there were programs in &quot;Af Soomaali&quot; run by the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education, the government ministry responsible for scholastic instruction.

When the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed&#x27;s modified Latin script was chosen by the Siad Barre administration as the nation&#x27;s official orthography, Somali language courses began to spring up throughout the country. The language of instruction in primary and secondary schools also became Somali.

===Relaunch===
On 14 November 2013, the former Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon &quot;Saacid&quot; and his cabinet approved a federal government plan to reopen the Somali National University. The refurbishing initiative cost US$55.2 million. On 16 August 2014, the federal government officially re-opened the Somali National University at a meeting of the Board of the University. The event was chaired by former President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who serves as the head of the university&#x27;s committee in charge of the curriculum, budget dispensation and faculties.

On 18 September 2014, about 480 pupils took the university&#x27;s entry exams, which were supervised by the Chairman of the Somali National University Dr. Mohamed Ahmed Jimale and the Deputy Minister of Culture and Higher Education Mohamed Ahmed Kulan. In October 2014, Speaker of the Federal Parliament Mohamed Osman Jawari and Minister of Culture and Higher Education Duale Adan Mohamed officially inaugurated the first academic year of the Somali National University.

==Campuses==
The Somali National University had four main campuses:
* Gaheyr – Mogadishu at KM 6
* Digfeer – Medical school near Digfeer Hospital in Mogadishu
* Lafoole Teaching College – Lafoole.
* Polytechnic College at KM 4, Mogadishu

The first campus, Gaheyr, opened in 1971 and was located at KM 6 (on the Afgooye Road, 6 km from downtown Mogadishu). There were also new expansion buildings across from Gaheyr Campus. The new buildings took some years to complete and were situated on the other side of the Afgoi road, facing Gaheyr.

Most of the new buildings had some sort of circular design to them, and the engineer who designed them was unofficially nicknamed &quot;Engineer O&quot; by the students.

==Faculties and departments==
The Somali National University formerly had 14 departments:
* Department of Sharia Law
* Department of Linguistics (Somali, Arabic, English, German, Italian)
* Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry
* College of Education (Teaching College at Lafoole; 20 km west of Mogadishu)

<doc id="729592" wikidata="Q1262279" url="?curid=729592" title="Sevier River">
<text>The Sevier River (pronounced &quot;severe&quot;) is a -long river in the Great Basin of southwestern Utah in the United States. Originating west of Bryce Canyon National Park, the river flows north through a chain of high farming valleys and steep canyons along the west side of the Sevier Plateau before turning southwest and terminating in the endorheic basin of Sevier Lake in the Sevier Desert. It is used extensively for irrigation along its course, with the consequence that Sevier Lake is usually dry.

The Sevier River drainage basin of covers more than 13 percent of Utah and includes parts of ten counties, of which the river flows through seven. The name of the river is derived from the Spanish &quot;Río Severo&quot;, &quot;violent river&quot;. The Sevier is the longest river entirely within the state of Utah.

==Course==
The Sevier River is formed by the confluence of Minnie Creek and Tyler Creek in Long Valley in Kane County. The headwaters are at an elevation of between the Markagunt Plateau (on the west) and the Paunsaugunt Plateau. The river flows north through a wide valley into Garfield County passing Hatch and Panguitch. It then flows through the narrow, Circleville Canyon and enters Piute County at the town of Circleville, and is joined by the East Fork Sevier River at Kingston. Immediately north of Kingston, it is dammed to form Piute Reservoir.

The Sevier continues north past Marysvale and through Marysvale Canyon (or Sevier Canyon) into Sevier County. At Sevier the river enters the agricultural Sevier Valley, a long basin between the Pavant Range on the west and the Sevier Plateau to the east. In the valley, the Sevier River flows generally northeast, passing the cities and towns of Sevier, Joseph, Elsinore, Monroe, Central Valley, Anabella, Richfield, Glenwood, Venice and Sigurd. Just north of Sigurd, the river is dammed to form Rocky Ford reservoir. The Sevier River then continues north passing the towns of Aurora, Salina and Redmond, then flows north into Sanpete County where it picks up the San Pitch River near Gunnison.

In Juab County the Yuba Dam forms Sevier Bridge Reservoir, which also extends into Sanpete County. Below the dam the river flows north then turns abruptly west through Leamington Canyon, between the Canyon Mountains and Gilson Mountains, into Millard County. The river flows southwest across the Sevier Desert, where it is used heavily for irrigation in the Delta area, and is dammed at the DMAD and Gunnison Bend reservoirs. The river is essentially dry for the last below Delta, through its confluence with the also dry Beaver River before reaching the intermittent Sevier Lake bed.

==Drainage basin==
The Sevier River drainage basin is on the border of the Basin and Range Province and the Colorado Plateau; the north and west parts of the basin are defined by long linear mountain ranges such as the Pavant and Canyon Mountains. To the east and south rise high plateaus and block-shaped mountain ranges, chief of which are the Wasatch and Sevier Plateaus to the east, and the Paunsaugunt and Markagunt Plateaus, the Pink Cliffs and the Tushar Mountains to the south. The entire basin is at high elevation, with the highest point at Delano Peak in the Tushar Mountains. There are twelve other peaks in the basin rising more than . The lowest point is at Sevier Lake, above sea level.
The basin experiences a continental climate ranging in character from semi-arid to alpine. Precipitation – ranging from in the desert valleys to more than in the mountains – falls largely as snow during the winter and early spring, and as monsoon thunderstorms in late summer and early fall. As of 1999, there was an estimated annual runoff of in the Sevier River basin, but only about of that reached Sevier Lake, and mostly in wet years. Even before irrigation, however, not all of this water reached Sevier Lake due to large evaporation losses in the Sevier Desert.

The Sevier River basin is bordered to the south by the drainage basins of Virgin River, Kanab Creek, Paria River, and Dirty Devil River, all tributaries of the Colorado River. To the east, it is bordered by the Price and San Rafael River basins, tributaries of the Green River, which flows into the Colorado River. On the north, it is bordered by the Utah Lake–Great Salt Lake basin, and to the west, it is bordered by the Great Salt Lake Desert basins.

Most of the Sevier drainage is rural, composed of small farming communities. The largest town is Richfield, with a population of 7,723 as of 2016. About 69 percent of the land is federally owned, much of that in national forest lands such as the Manti-La Sal, Fishlake, Dixie, and Uinta National Forests. The basin also includes parts of Bryce Canyon National Park and Cedar Breaks National Monument. About 23 percent of the basin is privately owned and 8 percent is owned by the state of Utah.

The Sevier River corridor is a major transportation route, with U.S. Route 89 closely following the river for over from its headwaters as far as Gunnison, and I-70 paralleling the river for about between Sevier and Salina.

==Geology==
Surface rock in the Sevier River basin is composed mostly of Tertiary igneous rock and sedimentary rock ranging in age from Jurassic to Quaternary. This is underlain by marine sedimentary rock including thick limestone layers, which accumulated prior to the Jurassic when the western US was part of a shallow sea. Uplift during the Jurassic and Cretaceous thrust western Utah above sea level for the first time. Between 100 and 80 million years ago, the Sevier Orogeny created mountains much higher than those found in western Utah today. The Sevier Desert was formed starting about 20 million years ago due to crustal stretching that lowered the local terrain. Another period of uplift occurred towards the end of the Tertiary, about 12–2 million years ago, creating most of the present-day mountain ranges and plateaus.

Significant vertical displacement has occurred on several north–south faults in the basin. The Sevier Fault and Elsinore Fault run mostly parallel to the upper Sevier River above Gunnison, and the Paunsaugunt fault runs in the same general direction further east, passing through Bryce Canyon. The Sevier Valley (and the Sanpete Valley north of it) is a graben or down-thrown block of land between the Sevier and Elsinore faults, with deep alluvial deposits filling the valley bottom. Groundwater basins occur mostly in the alluvial valleys and have been estimated to hold up to of water.
Large mineral deposits occur in various areas of the basin, including coal in the Salina area, beryllium in the Delta area, and gypsum in the Richfield area. The dry Sevier Lake bed as well as deposits in the Redmond area, are a major source of salts, including halites and potassium sulfates. Historically, uranium was mined near Marysvale. Above Marysvale Canyon, the colorful formations of Big Rock Candy Mountain are a widely recognized geological site in central Utah; yellow, red and orange bands are the result of jarosite, hematite and pyrite while white bands result from alunite and kaolinite presence.

During the Pleistocene Ice Age and other preceding ice ages, the Sevier River flowed into Lake Bonneville, which covered more than of the eastern Great Basin. The Sevier Valley was underwater as far upstream as Richfield. As the lake receded with a drying climate at the end of the ice age, what is now the Sevier Desert became an independent lake, which drained into the Great Salt Lake via a now dry channel in Millard County north of Delta. As Sevier Lake shrank, the Sevier River formed a large delta at its mouth, hence the name of the modern town. Soils become progressively more alkaline and saline closer to Sevier Lake, the result of the river transporting minerals downstream over millennia as the lake receded. The largest sand dunes in Utah, found in Little Sahara Recreation Area, were formed from Sevier River delta deposits moved over thousands of years by prevailing winds.

There have been relatively recent volcanic activity in the Sevier basin between 1000 and 1500 AD, when basalt flows occurred on the Markagunt and Paunsaugaut Plateaus and in Pahvant Valley. One of these flows dammed a valley and formed Navajo Lake.

==Plants and animals==
===Valley and stream habitats===
Due to the semi-desert climate, the valleys of the Sevier River basin were historically mostly grassland and shrubland, with the seeds of &quot;Oryzopsis hymenoides&quot; (Indian ricegrass) being an important food source for Native Americans. Many valley plants, such as greasewood, shadscale and saltgrass are adapted to the higher salt content in the soil. The valleys have been heavily modified for farming and grazing, and much of the remaining native grassland has been taken over by invasive species such as junegrass and the ubiquitous Russian thistle (tumbleweed), as well as native sagebrush whose range has expanded into formerly grassy areas.

The Sevier River historically supported large areas of wetland and riparian zones, especially where it formed a delta at the northern end of Sevier Lake. Many of these habitats have been replaced by agriculture, but there are still an estimated of wetland and aquatic habitat extant in the basin, of which about half is located in Millard and Sanpete counties alone. The upper reaches of the river and many mountain tributaries are home to cutthroat trout, brook trout and rainbow trout, of which cutthroat are the only native species. Much of the lower part of the river is a warm water fishery with brown trout, carp, suckers and channel catfish. Common fish found in reservoirs are walleye, smallmouth bass, yellow perch and northern pike.

Because the Sevier River provides some of the only water-based habitats in a large desert area, it is used by abundant migratory waterfowl, including geese, ducks, cranes, and shorebirds. Gunnison Bend Reservoir is visited by thousands of snow geese each spring. Other birds common to the Sevier basin include pheasants in agricultural and riparian areas; chukars in foothill areas and grouse in the hills and mountains. There are also multiple raptor species, including bald eagles and peregrine falcons. Fur-bearing animals such as beaver and river otter were once widespread before being trapped out in the early 1800s, and predators such as kit foxes, coyotes, and cougars still roam less populated areas of the basin.

===Mountain habitats===
In the high mountains and plateaus above elevation, conifer-aspen forest prevails in the alpine zone with forests of white fir, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, red cedar, spruce and quaking aspen. Engelmann spruce, limber pine and the occasional bristlecone pine are found at the highest elevations. Precipitation is sufficient to support many perennial streams and springs, which nourish mountain meadows and numerous small high elevation lakes. Large wildfires once regularly occurred on the mountains and plateaus, but since the beginning of the 20th century fires have been heavily suppressed.
The high country is home to small mammals such as ground squirrels, red squirrels, snowshoe hare, chipmunks and porcupine. Pika and marmot are found near mountain peaks and flying squirrels can be found in the Navajo Lake area. Larger mammals include mule deer, pronghorn (antelope), black bear and cougar. Also once found in the area were the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, bison, grizzly bear and timberwolves which were all hunted to extinction in the 1800s or early 1900s. The deer population was nearly extirpated during the era of western settlement, although it has since recovered.

The foothill and transition zones support a wide variety of vegetation types. Small hardwoods such as gambel oak, serviceberry, mountain mahogany, maple and scrub oak tend to occur at elevations of just below the boundary of the alpine zone, but still high enough to receive significant precipitation. In the lower foothills, pinyon–juniper &quot;pygmy forest&quot; mixed with areas of grassland and sagebrush occur between in elevation.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Paleo-Indians were present in southwestern Utah as early as 10,000 BC, when the climate was much wetter during the Pleistocene ice age and the Sevier basin was partially occupied by pluvial Lake Bonneville. Wetlands along the shoreline and a much fuller Sevier River provided abundant habitat for fish and wildlife, supporting a larger human population. Lake Bonneville had dried up by about 7000 BC, and the aridifying climate limited plant and animal resources. The Desert Archaic culture, characterized by small semi-nomadic bands, succeeded the Paleo-Indians but it is not known whether they are the descendants or an entirely different group. The Desert Archaic culture declined around 1500 BC, for reasons that are uncertain but have been attributed to massive flooding at that time.

Beginning about 500 AD, people of the Fremont culture inhabited the Sevier basin; a Fremont village site called Nawthis has been discovered in the Salina area dating to the years 800–1150 AD. There is evidence that these early peoples used irrigation for their crops – primarily corn, beans and squash. Fremont remains have also been found in southern Sevier County near Clear Creek. This site is now preserved as Fremont Indian State Park. The Fremont culture disappeared around 1300 AD, possibly due to an extended drought.

The ancestors of the Ute, Southern Paiute and Goshute peoples who populated the Sevier River basin immediately prior to European arrival migrated into the area possibly centuries after the decline of the Fremont culture. The traditional lands of these three peoples converged on the Sevier River delta in what is now Millard County. The Utes dominated most of the area traversed by the Sevier River including the Sevier Valley and the headwaters of the river. Notable sub-groups including the Pahvant Utes who lived around Sevier Lake, the Sanpits Utes from whom the name of Sanpete Valley and Sanpete County is derived from, and the Moanunt Utes who lived on the upper Sevier River. The Paiutes lived to the south and west of the delta, and the Goshutes inhabited drier areas to the northwest.

Settlers William Wolfskill and George C. Yount noted some Native Americans who called the river the &quot;Pooence&quot;.

===Explorers and traders===
The first Europeans to see the river were the Spanish missionaries Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante who led the Domínguez–Escalante expedition of 1776, trying to find a way to Monterey, California from Santa Fe, New Mexico. They arrived at the Sevier River on September 27, two days after leaving the Utah Valley, and camped at a location near the present day town of Mills. They named the Sevier River &quot;El Río de Santa Isabel&quot; and gave the name &quot;Laguna de Miera&quot; to Sevier Lake. However, the expedition was unable to find a way further west across the desert and was forced to turn back to Santa Fe. The expedition&#x27;s cartographer, Don Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, sketched a map showing an outlet from Sevier Lake to the Pacific Ocean, which may have given rise to the myth of a Buenaventura River draining the Great Basin to the sea.

The river was a major trade corridor during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, in no small part due to the route from Santa Fe opened up by Domínguez and Escalante. The Spanish traded manufactured goods and guns for furs, hides, horses and slaves from the Native Americans. Most of these slaves were Southern Paiutes that had been captured by more aggressive Ute bands. The river&#x27;s present name probably originated in 1813 with Spanish traders Moricio Arce and Lagos García, who ran into trouble with the Utes (supposedly when they rejected an offer by the Utes to sell them slaves) and escaped to a stream they called &quot;Río Severo&quot;, Spanish for &quot;violent&quot;.

In 1821, the Sevier River basin became Mexican territory following the Mexican Revolution. Mountain man William H. Ashley explored the area in 1825 in search of beaver; the river was dubbed the &quot;Ashley River&quot; by Jedediah Smith in Ashley&#x27;s honor. Smith is credited with blazing a connection between existing Native American trails through the Sevier basin in 1826; this became part of the northern branch of the Old Spanish Trail, following the middle and upper parts of the river. John C. Frémont traveled along the Sevier River on his 1844 exploration of the Great Basin, which confirmed that the Sevier and other Great Basin streams had no ocean outlet and the rumor of a &quot;Buenaventura River&quot; was no more than a myth. During the 1830s and 1840s the fur trade was in full force with thousands of beaver and otter taken from the Sevier River and its tributaries; most trappers were Native Americans although there were also many of British, French and Spanish origin. The slave trade also remained a major if controversial business and only ended after the Mexican–American War in 1848, after which the Sevier River became part of Utah Territory.

===19th-century settlers===

The first Mormon settlers arrived in the Sevier Valley in late 1849 under the direction of Brigham Young, but they and other whites passing through the region soon clashed with Native Americans. Sometime in early October 1853 a party of California-bound emigrants opened fire on a group of Pahvant Utes who had come to their camp to trade, killing one. In retaliation, on October 26, 1853, the Pahvants attacked a railroad survey crew led by Captain John W. Gunnison, killing eight members of the party near what is now the town of Delta. Despite the massacre, immigration continued with 30 Mormon families settling in the Richfield area in 1864, followed by 100 more the next year, further straining relations with the tribes.

Between 1865 and 1872 more than 150 violent confrontations occurred between Mormon settlers and various Native American groups including the Utes, Paiutes, Apache and Navajo, a period now known as the Black Hawk War after Timpanogos chief Antonga Black Hawk. Livestock grazing had decimated the local grasses whose seeds were a staple food for Native Americans, forcing them to raid white settlements and steal cattle for food. By June 1866 most of the settlements had been abandoned as the fighting increased. One of the bloodiest single episodes was the Circleville Massacre near the upper Sevier River, in which 26 Paiutes were killed by white settlers after an earlier attack by Ute warriors, despite the fact that the Paiutes and Utes were enemies. In total, at least 70 whites and an unknown number of Native Americans were killed.

The tribes were ultimately defeated with the intervention of the US government in 1870, although minor confrontations and skirmishes continued until about 1872. Most Native Americans in the area were moved to the Uintah Reservation in northeastern Utah. Many resisted the move, with several Ute bands traveling back to the Sanpete Valley early in 1872. Their presence alarmed Mormon settlers, as the Utes expressed discontent with conditions at the reservation. After the federal government sent additional supplies to the Uintah reservation, the Utes retreated.

By summer 1872 many towns in the area had been resettled, and the white population increased rapidly for a number of years. During this time, Richfield grew into the largest city in the Sevier Valley, sometimes referred to as &quot;the hub of Central Utah&quot;. The Deseret Telegraph was extended from Salt Lake City as far as Monroe in 1872. Development was slower to reach the upper Sevier country south of Marysvale Canyon, which was mostly ranching country although it would soon be the location of significant mineral strikes. Notorious outlaw Butch Cassidy grew up on a ranch near Circleville during the 1870s, where he &quot;learned to be a cowboy first and, later, how to put his brand on other peoples&#x27; livestock.&quot;

===Irrigation===

The first irrigation along the Sevier River was established in the spring of 1850, on the Sanpete County stretch of the river. Irrigation in Millard County began in 1859. The first storage reservoir in the Sevier basin was Scipio Reservoir, constructed in 1860. In 1865 in Sevier County, Mormon settlers dug the Richfield Irrigation Canal in just five weeks using only hand tools. Other farming towns were established along the river particularly after the Black Hawk war ended in 1872. A more ambitious project was the Tropic Ditch, which diverted water from the East Fork of the Sevier River through what is now Bryce Canyon National Park to the town of Tropic.

Agriculture was made difficult by frequent flooding of the Sevier River. In June 1909 heavy snowmelt broke the Gunnison Bend Dam and flooded the town of Deseret under of water. It was not until about 1912 when the river was finally controlled by major reservoirs upstream. The division of water rights became an issue as the population increased, due to limited water supplies during the dry season. In one particularly dry year some residents in Millard County &quot;were so angry they hired a posse in an unsuccessful attempt to remove upstream dams.&quot; In 1900 the Higgins Decree established a commission to allocate water in the lower Sevier River. The 1936 Cox Decree established allocations for the entire Sevier basin.

Heavy water use led to the drying up of Sevier Lake as early as 1880; dust blowing off the dry lake bed has become a persistent source of particulate pollution as far as Salt Lake City. However, the river and lake can still fill after major floods. In the especially wet season of 1982–1983, the melting of a record snowpack overwhelmed the reservoir system which had not been designed for flood control. Bridges, roads and diversion structures were washed out, and the DMAD and Gunnison Bend dams were partially breached. By May 1984 more than 1.5 million acre feet (1.9 billion m3) of water had flowed into Sevier Lake, temporarily inundating the dry lake bed deep.

===Mining, transport and power===
Along with agriculture, the Sevier basin has had a long history of mining and resource extraction, which continues in some areas of the basin today. Coal, rock salts and other minerals have been mined from the Salina area since the 1870s. In 1871 Mormon settlers reportedly found &quot;anthracite coal in almost inexhaustible quantities&quot; in Salina Canyon. In 1891 the Sevier Railroad, a branch of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW), reached Salina, and the town soon became the shipping point for both coal and agricultural products from the Sevier Valley. Much of the coal mined in the area is nowadays shipped to the Intermountain Power Plant, which was completed near Delta in 1986. The 1,900 megawatt power station consumes two million tons of coal and draws of cooling water from the Sevier River each year. In 2017 the Intermountain Power Agency announced it would be converting the plant to natural gas operations.
Gold was mined at several places along the river starting in the late 19th century. In 1896 the Sevier Railroad was extended to the gold mining area of Belknap and in 1900 tracks were laid through Marysvale Canyon to reach the diggings around Marysvale, with the line thereafter known as the &quot;Marysvale Branch&quot;. The boom town of Kimberly in the Tushar Mountains was one of the largest gold mining camps in Utah. Other boom towns of the period included Bullion City, Webster and Alunite, the latter of which produced significant quantities of aluminum ore.

Uranium was first discovered in Piute County in 1948. During the height of the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s, large amounts of uranium were mined along the upper Sevier River near Marysvale. The Marysvale district was fraught with health and environmental issues since early on; in 1951-52 inspectors in a Marysvale mine found radiation level 1,500 times above what was considered safe. Many of the miners were Navajo people who were often sent to work without any protective clothing or masks. In the following decades, many former uranium miners died of emphysema or various forms of cancer. The state of Utah later spent $500,000 closing down two hundred mines in the district.

Trains stopped running regularly on the Marysvale Branch in 1972, and in 1983 heavy flooding washed out much of the tracks along the Sevier River. That year the Thistle mudslide near Spanish Fork severed the northern end of the line, which was subsequently abandoned by the D&amp;RGW.

==Reservoirs and dams==
The Sevier River is extensively dammed and diverted to serve more than of farmland. Most of the basin is used for beef production, although there is a major turkey industry in Sanpete County. For the purpose of water distribution the basin is divided into upper and lower sections, with the dividing point at Vermillion Diversion Dam near Richfield. There are 175 irrigation companies in the Sevier River basin, with 72 of them serving over each. The Sevier River Water Users Association is responsible for regulating water use in the river system, and monitors reservoir storage levels, canal diversions and stream flows.

Total water use in the basin is more than 1 million acre feet (1.2 billion m3) annually, with more than 60 percent dedicated to agriculture. This figure is higher than the naturally available water supply since most of the water is used more than once. Due to the repeated reuse of agricultural return flows, salinity is a chronic issue in the lower Sevier River. As annual precipitation tends to vary greatly up to of water can be stored in surface reservoirs, with the largest three – Sevier Bridge, Piute and Otter Creek – accounting for 75 percent of that capacity.

===Otter Creek Reservoir===
Although small reservoirs such as Scipio, Panguitch and Gunnison Bend had been built starting in the 1860s, water demand was so high by the 1890s that planning began for much bigger dams and reservoirs. Otter Creek Reservoir was constructed between 1897 and 1901 by a consortium of ten irrigation companies in the Sevier Valley. The reservoir impounds Otter Creek, a tributary of the East Fork Sevier River, and also stores water diverted from the East Fork through a short canal. It has a storage capacity of .

===Piute Reservoir===
Piute Dam was constructed on the Upper Sevier River between 1908 and 1914, forming Piute Reservoir. The reservoir holds up to of water for use in the Sevier Valley. Water released from Piute Reservoir is diverted at the Sevier Valley Diversion Dam into the -long Sevier Valley-Piute Canal. It is one of the longest man-made waterways in Utah, irrigating along the western side of the valley in Sevier and Sanpete Counties.

===Sevier Bridge Reservoir===
By the early 1900s, the Lower Sevier often dried up below the Juab area, both due to heavy irrigation in the Upper Sevier and a series of drought years. The Deseret Irrigation Company began constructing Yuba Dam at the Sevier Bridge site in 1902, and work continued through 1907. &quot;Nearly every available man and boy in Deseret, Oasis and Hinckley worked at the dam.&quot; The dam was originally completed to a height of , and was raised to between 1913 and 1916. Water rights were sold to three other irrigation districts in the Lower Sevier. Sevier Bridge Reservoir has a capacity of , making it the fourth biggest man-made lake in Utah.

==Recreation==
Parts of the Upper Sevier, and its higher tributaries and feeder lakes, are good trout waters, particularly in National Forest lands. The basin has native cutthroat trout, and many streams contain introduced brook, brown and rainbow trout. A stretch of the East Fork in Black Canyon, above Tropic Reservoir, is classified as a Blue Ribbon trout fishery. This stretch was restored by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources between 1992 and 2006 due to damage from the 1983 flooding. Marysvale Canyon is also known for its trout during the non-irrigation (low water) season, being located in the tailwater of Piute Dam. Fishing is generally poor downstream of Marysvale Canyon due to the warm silty water, numerous diversion structures and degradation of riparian habitat.

Whitewater rafting is available on the Sevier through Marysvale Canyon.

<text>Glenfiddich distillery () is a Speyside single malt Scotch whisky distillery located in the Scottish burgh of Dufftown in Moray, Scotland. Is owned by William Grant &amp; Sons. The name Glenfiddich derives from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Gleann Fhiodhaich&quot; meaning &quot;valley of the deer&quot;, which is reflected in Glenfiddich&#x27;s stag logo.

==History==

The Glenfiddich Distillery was founded in 1886 by William Grant in Dufftown, Scotland, in the glen of the River Fiddich. The Glenfiddich single malt whisky first ran from the stills on Christmas Day, 1887.

In the 1920s, with prohibition in force in the US, Glenfiddich was one of a very small number of distilleries to increase production. This put them in a strong position to meet the sudden rise in demand for fine aged whiskies that came with the repeal of prohibition.

In the 1950s, the Grant family built up an onsite infrastructure that included coppersmiths to maintain the copper stills, and a dedicated cooperage that is now one of the very few remaining in distilleries. In 1956 the Grant&#x27;s brand launched the now-iconic triangular bottle, designed by Hans Schleger.

Following difficult times in the 1960s and 1970s, many small, independent distillers were bought up or went out of business. In order to survive, W. Grant &amp; Sons expanded their production of the drink, and introduced advertising campaigns and a visitors&#x27; centre. In this period they also decided to begin marketing single malt as a premium brand in its own right, effectively creating the modern single malt whisky category with the 1963 introduction of Glenfiddich single malt to the United States and other foreign markets.Later, W. Grant &amp; Sons was one of the first distilleries to package its bottles in tubes and gift tins, as well as recognising the importance of the duty-free market for spirits. This marketing strategy was successful, and Glenfiddich has since become the world&#x27;s best-selling single malt. It is sold in 180 countries, and accounts for about 35% of single malt sales.

Glenfiddich is currently managed by the fifth generation of William Grant&#x27;s descendants.

In September 2014, William Grant &amp; Sons agreed to acquire Drambuie for an undisclosed price rumoured to be in the region of £100 million.

In 2015, Glenfiddich commissioned ad agency Gravity Thinking to create a high tech YouTube campaign titled &quot;The Finishing Touch&quot; to promote the relaunch of their 21yo single malt, aged in Caribbean Reserva Rum Casks. The video showed a levitron isolating a single drop of whisky in a mid-air suspended animation, and featured Puerto Rican singer Calma Carmona performing the Franz Ferdinand song &quot;Love Illumination&quot; with the orchestra of the Scottish Opera arranged and conducted by Derek Williams. By the end of the campaign, the video had garnered more than 1.7 million YouTube hits.

Since 2002, Glenfiddich has had an Artists in Residence (AiR) programme with a total budget of £130,000 allowing artists to stay and work in the distillery each year. In 2019 there were eight artists in residence and in 2021, there were six artists in residence.

In 2021, the distillery began converting distillery trucks to run on biogas made from the distillery waste products.

==Production and location==
The Glenfiddich distillery produces Glenfiddich whisky in Dufftown, Moray.

Glenfiddich is a single malt Scotch whisky, this means the whisky was distilled at a single distillery using a pot still distillation process and must be made from a mash of malted barley.

Onsite there are 43 distinctively-shaped &quot;swan neck&quot; copper pot stills. These stills are smaller than those now in use at most other major distilleries. All stills are handmade and Glenfiddich employs a team of craftsmen and coppersmiths to maintain them. These stills have a capacity of around 21,000,000 litres of spirit.

The water source for Glenfiddich Whisky is The Robbie Dhu springs nearby to the distillery.

Glenfiddich is matured in many different casks, such as:

# &quot;Rum&quot; casks from the Caribbean
# &quot;Bourbon whiskey&quot; barrels from America
# &quot;Sherry&quot; butts from Jerez de la Frontera in Spain

Once the spirit has matured, the casks are emptied and the whisky is &quot;cut&quot; with pure Robbie Dhu spring water.

Glenfiddich has a bottling hall onsite along with a large bottling plant in Bellshill.

Glenfiddich is a distillery in Scotland&#x27;s Malt Whisky Trail, a tourism initiative featuring seven working Speyside distilleries including Glenfiddich, a historic distillery (Dallas Dhu, now a museum) and the Speyside Cooperage.

==Glenfiddich Awards==
Started in 1970, Glenfiddich promoted the Glenfiddich Food and Drink Awards to honour distinguished writing and broadcasting in the fields of food and drink in the UK. In 2008, Glenfiddich decided to discontinue distributing Food and Drink Awards, reviewing their &quot;strategy, scope and potential application in some of Glenfiddich’s key markets outside the UK.&quot;

Started in 1998, Glenfiddich promoted the Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards. The Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards were annual awards given to notable Scottish people. Glenfiddich sponsored the event, in association with The Scotsman newspaper. Nine awards were distributed for art, business, environment, food, music, screen, sport, writing and &quot;Top Scot&quot;. A consulting panel nominated four people in each category, with the winner decided by a public vote. The &quot;Top Scot&quot; is an open award, with the public able to nominate anyone. The awards haven&#x27;t been hosted since 2014.

<text>Simmern (; officially Simmern/Hunsrück) is a town of roughly 8,155 inhabitants (Dec. 2023) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, the district seat of the Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis, and the seat of the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; Simmern-Rheinböllen. In the Rhineland-Palatinate state development plan, it is set out as a middle centre.

==Geography==

===Location===
Simmern, through whose municipal area the 50th parallel of north latitude runs, lies in the Hunsrück in the so-called &quot;Simmerner Mulde&quot; (“Simmern Hollow”). The old town centre is found in the valley of the Simmerbach, while the newer neighbourhoods are spread over the surrounding heights. The Külzbach empties into the Simmerbach on the town&#x27;s western outskirts. East of the town is a recreational area with a manmade lake, the Simmersee. South of the town is the town forest, which forms the edge of the Soonwald, a heavily wooded section of the west-central Hunsrück.

The municipal area measures 1 196 ha. Of interest to visitors are Simmern&#x27;s value as a nature and leisure site, and its central location right near three rivers, the Moselle, the Rhine and the Nahe, each about 25 km away, allowing easy day trips to other nearby places.

Simmern lies 630 km from Berlin and 55 km west of Mainz.

===Climate===
Yearly precipitation in Simmern amounts to 690 mm, which falls into the middle third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. Only at 38% of the German Weather Service&#x27;s weather stations are lower figures recorded. The driest month is January. The most rainfall comes in August. In that month, precipitation is 2.1 times what it is in January. Precipitation varies greatly. Only at 25% of the weather stations are higher seasonal swings recorded. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==History==

===Middle Ages and Early Modern Times===
In 1072, Simmern had its first documentary mention. The place where the town now stands, however, was already settled in Roman times. There are seemingly mentions before the 11th century, but these cannot be definitively linked to the town, or most likely refer to the Simmerbach, the local river. Simmern lay on the important Bingen-to-Trier army road. It belonged at first to the Counts of the Nahegau, later passing to the Raugraves, who were enfeoffed with Simmern by the Electorate of Trier sometime between 1323 and 1330. Presumably with Archbishop Baldwin&#x27;s help, Simmern was granted town rights in 1330 by Emperor Louis the Bavarian. The weekly and yearly markets were soon drawing dealers throughout the Hunsrück to town, leading to flourishing trade and business. Along with town rights came the town&#x27;s right to fortify itself, and this it did with a formidable double wall, complete with a series of towers and gates. Before the 14th century was over, Simmern passed to the Counts Palatine of the House of Wittelsbach.

The Palatine Wittelsbachs were, beginning in 1356, Electors, and after Elector Palatine and King of the Romans (German King) Ruprecht III&#x27;s death, they split into several lines, among which was the Palatinate-Simmern line, which kept its residence in the town. Worthy of mention are the Dukes Stefan of Palatinate-Simmern-Zweibrücken, Friedrich I of Palatinate-Simmern, Johann I and, above all, Johann II. He ruled in Simmern from 1509 to 1557, was humanistically and artistically trained, had the first printshop in the town built and promoted the arts, particularly sculpture. He also introduced the Reformation into his duchy, which led to tension with the neighbouring Archbishoprics of Trier and Mainz. He was followed by Friedrich III, called “the Pious”, who converted to Calvinism in 1563 and played a leading role in Imperial politics. In 1559, the Palatinate-Simmern line succeeded the now extinct main line of the Palatinate in the Elector&#x27;s capacity in Heidelberg. Friedrich III&#x27;s brothers Georg and Reichard formed the short-lived line of the counts palatine of Simmern-Sponheim, whose holdings passed back to the Electorate under Friedrich IV on Reichard&#x27;s death in 1598.

===Wars in the Palatinate===
Friedrich IV&#x27;s son, Friedrich V was elected King of Bohemia – Bohemia was an elective monarchy – but soon ran afoul of the forces arrayed against him, notably the Catholic League and the Holy Roman Emperor himself, and not only was he forced to flee Bohemia in the face of these forces after only a year on the Bohemian throne (earning himself the derisive nickname “Winter King”), but he also saw to it that the Electorate of the Palatinate, too, was gripped in the throes of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Emperor also declared all Friedrich&#x27;s holdings within the Holy Roman Emperor forfeit. His holdings in the Rhenish Palatinate were meanwhile once again partitioned with the founding of the younger line of Palatinate-Simmern by his brother Ludwig Philipp in 1611, though even this passed with Ludwig Philipp&#x27;s son, Ludwig Heinrich&#x27;s death in 1673 back to the main line under Karl I Ludwig, who won back the Electoral title in the Peace of Westphalia. Thanks to his fortifying the town, it came through the wars relatively unscathed. When Karl&#x27;s son, Karl II died in 1685, though, there was further upheaval, for with him the Palatine line of the Wittelsbachs had died out, and France was now declaring rights of possession. Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine (known as Liselotte of the Palatinate), Karl II&#x27;s sister, and in France&#x27;s eyes the rightful heir, was married to Duke Philippe I, Duke of Orleans, King Louis XIV&#x27;s brother. Since the Palatinate-Neuburg line of the Wittelsbachs also maintained a claim to the Simmern inheritance, the Nine Years&#x27; War (known in Germany as the &quot;Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg&quot;, or War of the Palatine Succession) broke out in 1688, during which the French laid waste to broad swathes of the Palatinate.

By 1685, the Duchy of Simmern had passed to the Palatinate-Neuburg line. This noble house reintroduced the Catholic faith and called on the Boppard Carmelites to minister to the Catholics in the town of Simmern and the like-named &quot;Oberamt&quot;. With the family Schenk von Schmidtburg&#x27;s help, the Carmelites founded a presence in town, and together with the Kreuznach Capuchins, took over pastoral duties in the &quot;Oberamt&quot;. They built Saint Joseph’s Church. Not long before this, the town of Simmern itself had been flooded with a great many Huguenots who had fled religious persecution in France. On 17 September 1689, French troops overwhelmed the town, leaving almost all of it in rubble. The palatial residence was razed, just like the one in Heidelberg. All that was left standing after this catastrophe was Saint Stephen’s Church, the &quot;Pulverturm&quot; (“Powder Tower”, later to be known as the “Schinderhannes Tower”) and a handful of houses. Nevertheless, the Wittelsbachs won out and remained the Palatinate&#x27;s rulers under the terms of the Treaty of Ryswick. In the 18th century, however, Simmern was nothing more than the seat of a Palatine &quot;Oberamt&quot;, as the electors chose to keep their residence at Mannheim.

===18th to 20th century===

After the French Revolution, the French once again conquered the Palatinate, which they annexed to their country along with the rest of the Rhine&#x27;s left bank. Simmern became a canton in the Department of Rhin-et-Moselle. It was by the regular patrols of the newly founded National Gendarmerie that Johannes Bückler, later a well known robber and often called “Schinderhannes”, was caught, although at this time he was nothing more than a small-time livestock thief in the Hunsrück and the northern Palatinate. In 1799 he spent half a year locked up in the tower that now bears his nickname, the &quot;Schinderhannesturm&quot;, in Simmern, from which he managed to escape. In 1804, Emperor Napoleon I spent some time in the town, which in the meantime had acquired a municipal administration run according to French law. In 1815 Simmern was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna.

The town&#x27;s situation in the 19th century, outside the centres of industrialization, was not easy, and much the less so as of 1845 with the potato blight outbreak and the attendant bad harvests, which drove many inhabitants to seek a better life in the New World.

In the First World War, Simmern was an important support base for troops marching to the Western Front. In Weimar times, when the town was also occupied once again by the French, Simmern suffered under the dire economic situation of the time. In the Second World War, there was yet more destruction. In March 1945, Simmern was occupied by American troops, but was later assigned along with the rest of the Palatinate to the French zone of occupation. Since 1946, Simmern has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The town has borne the name element “Hunsrück” since 1 June 1980. On 15 April 1999, Simmern concluded a territorial swap with the municipality of Mutterschied, whereby several inhabitants found themselves living in a different municipality.

==Politics==

===Town council===
The council is made up of 24 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:
===Mayor===
Simmern&#x27;s mayor is Dr. Andreas Nikolay, and his deputies are Peter Mumbauer, Karl-Heinz Augustin and Michael Becker.

===Coat of arms===
The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Per fess sable a lion passant Or armed, langued and crowned gules, and bendy lozengy argent and azure.

Simmern was held by the Raugraves until 1358, when it passed to the Counts Palatine of the House of Wittelsbach. Simmern was granted town rights in 1555. The arms are based on the town&#x27;s oldest known seal, which dates from the late 14th century. The charge above the line of partition is the Palatine Lion, and the “bendy lozengy” pattern (that is, slanted diamonds) is the Wittelsbachs’ armorial bearing. Otto Hupp’s version of the town’s arms, as seen in the Coffee Hag albums in the 1920s, was presented in a somewhat different style (but these differences are common among heraldic artists), and with one heraldic difference: the lion is missing his crown. The tinctures, however, are the same.

The arms have been borne since 1901.

===Town partnerships===
Simmern fosters partnerships with the following places:
* Migennes, Yonne, France
* Igrejinha, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
* Mänttä-Vilppula, Pirkanmaa, Finland
* Roeser, Canton of Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg

===More about buildings===
Saint Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church, built in the 18th century, has ceiling frescoes worth seeing. For its part, Saint Stephen&#x27;s Evangelical Church, built between 1486 and 1510, has tombs of the dukes of Palatinate-Simmern and an historical organ from 1776 built by the Hunsrück organ-building family Stumm.

The cultural centre at &quot;Schloss Simmern&quot; has its &quot;Hunsrückmuseum&quot; with an exhibit by Friedrich Karl Ströher (Hunsrück painter) and the town library. The new palace was built in 1708 as the &quot;Oberamtmann’s&quot; administration building. It was here that the mediaeval castle once stood. This was expanded into a palatial residence in the latter half of the 15th century, but destroyed together with the rest of the town in 1689.

The so-called &quot;Schinderhannesturm&quot;, formerly the “Powder Tower”, was used as a prison, and at different times held both Schinderhannes, the infamous robber, and Johann Peter Petri, his henchman, better known as &quot;Schwarzer Peter&quot; (“Black Peter”). Each eventually escaped.

The Restaurant Schwarzer Adler is notable as one of the few houses in town that was spared the razing that the rest of the town underwent at French hands in 1689. It stands with Saint Stephen&#x27;s Church and the &quot;Schinderhannesturm&quot; as one of the town&#x27;s oldest buildings.

===Sport and leisure===
Simmern has an indoor swimming pool and an outdoor “nature” pool, the &quot;Dschungeldorf&quot; (“Jungle Village”) indoor children&#x27;s adventure playground, a youth café, a skating park and a cinema.

Beginning on the town&#x27;s western outskirts is the &quot;Schinderhannes-Radweg&quot; (cycle path), running from there through the Külztal (Külzbach valley) by way of Kastellaun to Emmelshausen. To the south runs the &quot;Schinderhannes-Soonwald-Radweg&quot; (another cycle path), which links Simmern with the Soonwald.

In 2007 and 2008, the town staged the &quot;Schinderhannesfestspiele&quot; (theatrical plays) for the first time. The first production was &quot;Der Ausbruch&quot; (“The Breakout”), a play about Schinderhannes&#x27;s daring escape from the town&#x27;s “Powder Tower” (now called the “Schinderhannes Tower”) in August 1799. The Powder Tower had been said to be escape-proof. In 2010, the &quot;Schinderhannesfestspiele&quot; were staged for the third time. This time, the production was the musical &quot;Julchen&quot;.

Simmern&#x27;s sport clubs are VfR Simmern and BGV Simmern. VfR Simmern is well known for its football team, SG Soonwald/Simmern (a coöperative effort with clubs in the surrounding area), table tennis (regional league) and its handball team, HSG Kastellaun/Simmern (a coöperative effort with TV Kastellaun 09). Furthermore, VfR also offers basketball, swimming, badminton and other sports. TC Sportpark Simmern is the town&#x27;s tennis club.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===
The four-lane &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 50 runs by south of town. Simmern has a railway station, which currently serves only as a bus station. The station was once a transfer station along the &quot;Hunsrückquerbahn&quot; between Bingen and Hermeskeil. The railway is currently in disuse, but plans are being made to reactivate a portion of it (including the section in Simmern) in order to connect Frankfurt-Hahn Airport with the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. A former spur between Simmern and Kastellaun has been re-purposed as a dedicated bicycle path, the &quot;Schinderhannes-Radweg&quot;.

The reopening of Frankfurt-Hahn Airport (20 km away) for commercial aviation and the widening of Bundesstrasse B-50 to four lanes have given the district and the town even greater economic potential for the future. Future plans include a possible extension of the Autobahn A 60 to facilitate traffic from the Frankfurt metropolitan area to Simmern and the Benelux countries. The town is roughly 10 kilometres from the Autobahn A 61.

===Economy===
Slate mining and agriculture have been the traditional industries of the district, but recent growth in the optical, pharmaceutical and biochemical industries has transformed the local economy.

Among the town&#x27;s biggest employers are the following: ZF Boge Elastmetall (roughly 600 employees), CompAir (compressed air and gas systems, roughly 500 employees), the firm Pfefferkorn (Sekt stopper maker), Deutsche Fertighaus Holding (prefabricated buildings), SchwörerHaus KG (works for finishing “Kastell”-brand solid-construction houses, basements, ceilings and prefabricated concrete articles), Zischka Textilpflege (laundry service), the &quot;Hunsrück-Klinik&quot; and DHL, with a logistical centre. Besides these, there are several discount stores and many smaller service-sector businesses. Over the last few years, Simmern has grown into a regional hub for the automotive trade. Simmern has grown tremendously in the last twenty years as more people and new industries have relocated to the area.
===Other business activity===
There is also a cinema, the “Pro-Winz-Kino”. The business association, &quot;Simmern attraktiv e. V.&quot;, is a union of the town&#x27;s business owners, who have, for instance, set themselves the goal of strengthening the town as a retail centre and making it more attractive to citizens, shoppers and visitors.

===Education===
Simmern has two primary schools, the &quot;Kurt-Schöllhammer-Grundschule&quot; and the &quot;Rottmannschule&quot;. It also has a regional school for Hauptschule and Realschule certificates, the state mathematical-natural sciences &quot;Herzog-Johann-Gymnasium&quot;, the professional training school with an economics Gymnasium, several vocational schools and upper vocational schools and the &quot;Hunsrückschule für Lernbehinderte&quot; (for learners with learning difficulties). The folk high school is charged with providing adult education.

===Public institutions===
Besides the town and district administrations, a number of other public entities can be found in Simmern (&quot;Amtsgericht&quot;, financial, forestry, health and cadastral office, police, branch office of the Koblenz chamber of commerce, district craftsmen&#x27;s association). The town is also the location of a “technology and founders’ centre” (&quot;Technologie- und Gründerzentrum&quot;, the “founders” being entrepreneurs who found businesses).

<text>Blink (Clarice Ferguson) is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Joe Madureira, Blink is the pink-skinned mutant leader of the Exiles, a group tasked with correcting problems in various alternate worlds and divergent timelines in the Marvel Multiverse. &quot;Redefined&quot; from an Earth-616 variant of the character previously created by Lobdell and Madureira for the crossover event &quot;The Phalanx Covenant&quot; as a member of Generation X killed by the Phalanx, who first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #317 (October 1994), the &quot;Pink Blink&quot; of Earth-295 is considered a breakout character, serving as the protagonist of the ongoing series &quot;Exiles&quot; and limited series &quot;Blink&quot;.

A Chinese version of Blink named Clarice Fong is introduced in the &quot;X-Men&quot; feature film &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), portrayed by Fan Bingbing, with Jamie Chung subsequently portraying a younger version of Fong in the television series &quot;The Gifted&quot; (2017–2019).

== Publication history ==

Created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Joe Madureira, Blink first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #317 (Oct. 1994).

An unstable mutant with the ability to teleport, Blink was one of the mutants captured by the Phalanx during the 1994 X-Universe crossover event Phalanx Covenant. In print, the character died within a month of her first appearance. The primary-universe version of Blink returned to publication in 2009.

Lobdell and Madureira redefined Blink as a more confident and assertive character in the parallel universe storyline &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; (1995). As a result of her redefinition and increased exposure during that event, Blink became a fan favorite, as exemplified in her return in the regular title &quot;Exiles&quot; in 2001. The character was featured in the four-issue &quot;Blink&quot; limited series in 2000.

== Fictional character biography ==
Blink was first introduced in the &quot;Phalanx Covenant&quot; storyline as an inexperienced teleporting mutant who is killed by the titular race. The more widely published version of Blink is a variant from the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; alternate reality of Earth-295. Like her Earth-616 counterpart, she was born with pink skin but exhibits a more refined power set, having mastered several methods of utilizing her powers. In addition to opening teleportational portals, she can also focus her ability into short, transparent, crystal-like javelins, which teleport whatever persons or objects they touch. She can charge her javelins so they can cut through objects by teleporting the matter elsewhere as they strike or they can be charged to stun opponents unconscious by putting them &quot;out of phase&quot;. She usually keeps a supply of these in a quiver around her back, but can make them, one at a time, at will. Her teleportation is always accompanied by a &quot;blink!&quot; sound, from which she takes her codename. She has proven many times to be a skilled hand-to-hand fighter, and it is unknown whether her enhanced agility is the result of simple training or a consequence of her mutation.

=== Early years ===

In the Age of Apocalypse storyline, Professor X was killed years before he ever formed the X-Men. An alternate reality unfolded into which the 5,000-year-old super mutant Apocalypse gained control of North America and implemented a genocide campaign against regular humans.

Clarice Ferguson was born in Cartusia, Bahamas. Her purple skin complexion revealed her to be a mutant at birth. Her parents accepted this fact but feared their daughter would not be accepted by the local population. When Clarice was four, the Fergusons moved to Miami, Florida, in the United States. They hoped Miami would be home to a mutant population where an older Clarice would be able to socialize.

Clarice was a child when Apocalypse took over Miami. Blink was discovered by Apocalypse&#x27;s Horseman, Mister Sinister, and his right-hand the Dark Beast, who experimented on her, refining her powers.

In the 2000 &quot;Blink&quot; limited series, it is revealed in flashback that the mutant villain Sugar Man was at one point the jailer in charge of cellmates Illyana Rasputin (the long lost sister of fellow X-Man Colossus) and Clarice (before she was rescued as a young girl by Weapon-X and Sabretooth) in a prison facility.

Sabretooth and Weapon X, members of the resistance force, the X-Men, raid Beast&#x27;s laboratories and rescue Blink. She becomes the unofficial adopted daughter of Sabretooth, and always refers to him as &quot;Mr. Creed&quot;.

Blink grows into adulthood with the X-Men. She is impulsive and not always willing to follow orders, but becomes an important X-Man. In a limited series which focused uniquely on her character, Blink suffers partial amnesia and was briefly transported into the Negative Zone, where she is romantically involved with the amnesiac Annihilus, although he forces her to leave when he begins to transform back into his original form.

Eventually, the X-Men encountered the time travelling X-Man Bishop, who set a course of events that prevented the death of Professor X, eliminating the Age of Apocalypse reality.

=== Miniseries ===
Blink had her own four-part miniseries within the setup of the Age of Apocalypse storyline. In it, she has a falling out with Magneto and travels to the Negative Zone to seek aid in defeating Apocalypse but, due to the travel, loses her memory. She meets a man named Ahmyor who turns out to be the leader of a freedom force dedicated in removing Blastaar from the throne of the Negative Zone. Blink, not knowing who she is or where she came from, joins this force and, in turn, falls in love with Ahmyor- who, they both later learn, is a previous stage of Annihilus, who regressed to this point in his life after his last confrontation with Blastaar and lost his memories. He was the one who Blastaar took the throne from. Blink regains her memory and manages to save Annihilus before teleporting back to her own world to the X-Men who were looking for her.

In a flashback in this series, it is revealed that Blink was once cellmates with the AoA version of Illyana before being rescued by Weapon-X and Sabretooth, and that both of them were tortured regularly by the Sugarman, who was their jailer at the time.

=== &quot;Exiles&quot; ===

Blink was later on mysteriously transported to a strange desert plateau, where she met a group of other mutants from various realities who had been unstuck in time. A cosmic monitor called the Timebroker explained that each had become &quot;unhinged&quot; from reality, and their new mission was to visit various parallel worlds and &quot;correct wrongs&quot;. While the other Exiles would each be returned to their own realities, but altered in some horrible way as a result of being unhinged, if they failed to correct things, Blink was told that she would cease to exist.

Blink became the leader of this group of Exiles – her teammates reasoning that she was more removed from the realities that they were familiar with and would therefore be better equipped emotionally to make whatever judgement calls might be needed if they were forced to fight former allies-, and formed a relationship with her teammate Mimic. They went to many worlds, fighting the Hulk, Galactus, Weapon X, Mojo, and the Vi-Locks among other enemies. On the world where a mutated strain combining the Legacy Virus and the Techno-organic virus was taking over, Blink was infected by it. She was later cured by the intervention of the Norse gods. The Exiles were celebrating when the Timebroker appears, saying that Blink was going home. Blink is teleported away, replaced by Magik.

However, the Timebroker lied and instead of sending her to her home dimension, she was quarantined in a previous reality the team had visited. There, the Exiles were paired up with Weapon X and given the assignment to kill a young child named David Richards, who, left unchecked, would become an all-powerful megalomaniac. Instead, Sabretooth opted to stay and raise the child so that he would not become evil. He had failed. When Blink landed in Sabretooth&#x27;s reality and helped him destroy Sentinels, David hijacked her teleporting ability and made her kill dozens of humans. Blink was emotionally scarred by the experience, and it was hinted that she would have succumbed to this destructive tendencies up to the point of potential suicide had Sabretooth not saved her.

She was later rescued and came back to the Exiles after Sunfire died. For the next mission, they were given the task of dwindling down the ranks of the two teams to only six members by killing each other. While fighting Hyperion, who seemed invincible, Blink prevailed by teleporting his own laser attack back at him. Then, Gambit—the official leader of the Exiles at the time—blew himself and Hyperion up, thus completing the mission.

Trying to throw off the team dynamic, the Timebroker introduced Sabretooth onto the team. This caused Clarice to doubt her leadership abilities and defer to Sabretooth&#x27;s advice, a fact that Mimic was not happy about. The Timebroker gave Blink a mission in which she was instructed to kill Mimic soon after, but she refused. When she did, the Tallus shifted from her arm to Sabretooth&#x27;s, making him the de facto leader.

The Timebroker then tried to disrupt the team by introducing Holocaust, from Sabretooth and Blink&#x27;s home reality, into their ranks. He also sent the team back to the Age of Apocalypse (implying that by repairing their damaged timelines, Blink and Sabertooth had prevented the erasure of this timeline). However, this had a rather productive effect. Holocaust became obsessed with finding the source of the Timebroker&#x27;s broadcasts and, experimenting with a shard of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal, the Exiles teleported into the Timebroker&#x27;s base—Panoptichron. Once there, the team found that the resurrected evil Hyperion had taken over the crystal citadel and had been manipulating their missions for quite some time. The Exiles began to fight him again, suffering the death of Namora and Holocaust as well as the near-fatal wounding of Morph and Mimic. However, it was Blink, once again, who saved the day. Since Hyperion had learned his mistake from their last battle, Blink had to come up with a new strategy for defeating the powerful foe. She did this by teleporting a lot of sand into him, effectively incapacitating him, and then marooning him on his desolate home dimension.

As the events of the House of M warped reality, the Exiles found themselves in the midst of it (since they had decided to drop Beak back home). The mad, reality warping mutant Proteus found himself reborn and was able to escape to another reality before Earth-616 was set right again. The Exiles endeavored to track him down since they felt responsible for his release—Proteus had discovered the existence of alternate realities via accessing the Tallus. Shockingly, Proteus infected Mimic, and Blink was unable to save him before his body withered away into a lifeless husk. This severely affected Blink, and Proteus seemed to retain some of Mimic&#x27;s memories of he and Blink&#x27;s relationship and purported to love her. Her relationship with Sabretooth was also affected. The man that she once looked up to as a mentor and called &quot;Mr. Creed&quot; was now only referred to as &quot;Victor&quot;, showing the distance that was growing between them.

Swearing revenge, the Exiles tracked Proteus down to the Future Imperfect reality, but were unable to prevent the madman from taking another life. This time Proteus took the body of Morph, but with Blink&#x27;s quick thinking she was able to trap Proteus in Morph&#x27;s body by blinking a behavior modification crown onto his head, causing him to believe he really is Morph. With the hunt for Proteus at an end, Blink remained an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. She and the other Exiles returned all former members of the Exiles and Weapon X that were trapped in the Stasis Gallery to their home realities, dead or alive. Blink was going to bury Mimic in the Panoptichron desert until Power Princess suggested that she check with Mimic&#x27;s family on burial wishes. Blink returned Mimic to his home reality for burial, and spent some time with his version of the X-Men, almost accepting their wish for her to join their team.

After a mission where the Exiles had to save Galactus, Blink once more called Sabretooth &#x27;Mister Creed&#x27;. Blink later left the team to take a break with Nocturne and Thunderbird on Heather&#x27;s Earth. Blink is called back into action when the New Exiles (minus Morph and Psylocke) are left inoperable after being immersed within the Crystal Palace. Morph summons her, Nocturne, and Heather to help create a new team of Exiles: Beast, Forge, Polaris, Panther, and the Witch. Blink is put in charge of this new team, and pretends to be new just like the others. However, she is found out at the end of their first mission.

Blink is starred in Saladin Ahmed&#x27;s cancelled &quot;Exiles&quot;, which launched in 2018.

== Characteristics ==
=== Ancestry ===
In the &quot;Apocalypse Vs Dracula&quot; mini series written by Frank Tieri, it is revealed that in 1897 London, Apocalypse&#x27;s genetic descendants called the Clan Akkaba had a member called Frederick Slade. Slade was characterized with pink hair and eyes that were tinted green, and he had the ability to teleport himself, others, and selected objects with a &#x27;blink&#x27; effect. In the hope that the Clan Akkaba would still continue, Apocalypse&#x27;s servant Ozymandias made sure that Frederick would sire a child with a woman known as Miss Ferguson. Given the similarity in powers and allusions made within the mini series, it is assumed that Clarice Ferguson/Blink is a descendant of the 19th Century Frederick Slade and Miss Ferguson and therefore a descendant of Apocalypse.

Slade showed up still alive but elderly in an issue of &quot;New Excalibur&quot; and leading a new Clan Akkaba along with Ozymandias.

=== Appearance ===
Blink also has lilac skin, dark magenta hair, pointed ears and pupil-less green eyes (this was a change in &quot;Exiles&quot;: both Ultimate Marvel and Age of Apocalypse Blink has white eyes with a blue sheen). She also has pink marks across her face: these are not decorations or tattoos, and were present from birth.

=== Powers and abilities ===
Blink can teleport herself and large masses, including sizable groups of people. She can also use her powers in a destructive manner by teleporting only parts of objects. She can open portals that displace projectiles and even enemies that threaten her. Blink&#x27;s portals are typically pink and accompanied by a &quot;Blink&quot; sound. She has proven to be a very skilled hand-to-hand fighter, having honed her skills by training with Sabretooth.

== Reception ==
=== Accolades ===
* In 2014, &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; ranked Blink 46th in their &quot;95 X-Men Members Ranked From Worst To Best&quot; list.

== Other versions ==
===Earth-616===

In the primary Earth-616 continuity of the Marvel Universe, Blink was introduced in the &quot;Phalanx Covenant&quot; storyline, in which the extraterrestrially derived techno-organic beings called the Phalanx captured her and several other young mutants to assimilate their powers. This version of Blink was tense and panicky and frightened of her powers (having &quot;woken up in a pool of blood&quot; after her first use of them). Clarice could not properly control her powers, and apparently was unable to teleport anything in an intact form. Instead, any object or person caught in Blink&#x27;s teleportation field, also known as a &quot;blink wave&quot;, would be shredded. She eventually used her abilities to &quot;cut up&quot; Harvest, a Phalanx entity guarding her and her peers, but she was caught in her own teleportation field and died in the process. Because of her sacrifice, the remaining captives were set free and became the X-Men junior team Generation X.

When Hercules travels to the Underworld in &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, Blink is among the dead characters seen in Erebus gambling for their resurrection. Unlike the others, Blink just stands there watching them gamble.

====&quot;Necrosha&quot;====
Prior to the events of &quot;Necrosha&quot;, Selene begins gathering a new Inner Circle consisting of mutants with death-related powers. Taking a ship to the spot where Blink had fought Harvest and reaching into the air, Selene&#x27;s hand disappeared and Blink was then pulled out of nowhere. Selene reveals to Blink she had actually been stranded in another realm (Erebus) after her fight with Harvest, where she remained in a not-quite-dead state, all the while suffering in agony. After healing her, Selene manipulates Blink by stating she&#x27;s been looking for her for a while and could hear her crying out for help. Selene furthers her manipulations by telling her Emma Frost could hear her as well but left her behind, claiming she was too dangerous to save. Selene convinces the young mutant to join her cause claiming to be able to put an end to her cycle of pain and betrayal. Several weeks later, Selene and Blink go to New Orleans where Blink kills a man, using her powers to split him into numerous fragments and along with Selene, takes his mansion as a base of operations.

Blink visits Selene&#x27;s birthplace in Europe before traveling to Rome and New York where they slaughter the New York branch of the Hellfire Club. After they are done, she teleports Selene&#x27;s forces to Utopia where they attack the X-Men before returning to Selene, where they then journey to Genosha.

When Selene dispatches her Inner Circle to retrieve the mystical knife necessary to complete her ritual, Blink teleports them onto Utopia. In the confrontation, she is recognised by Emma Frost. During the fight, Blink and Senyaka attack Archangel, Senyaka ensnaring him with his coils and restraining him before Blink uses her powers to obliterate Archangel&#x27;s wings.

After finding the knife, Blink teleports to Genosha with a captured Warpath. Blink is present when Eli Bard gives Selene the knife and is killed in the process. She is later sent along with Thunderbird to watch over Warpath, however he is eventually rescued by the Vanisher.

When Selene began absorbing the many souls around her, she commands her minions to get her more souls to which Blink teleports most of the resurrected mutants and former-mutants to Genosha for Selene to absorb.

During the final fight, Blink evades Domino&#x27;s shots, using her teleporting abilities to outmanoeuvre her. Blink fails to account for the similar abilities of the Vanisher, who plucks Blink back out of her teleports. He then holds her while Archangel slashes her with his wings, taking revenge for her earlier assault. During Selene&#x27;s downfall, Blink flees, taking the heavily wounded Mortis with her.

====&quot;To Serve and Protect&quot;====
Sometime after the events of Necrosha, Emma Frost and a small team of X-Men consisting of Blindfold, Pixie, Husk, Warpath and former Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange track Blink down in Eastern Europe where she&#x27;s attempting to resurrect Selene. After a brief battle, Blindfold predicts Blink is going to commit suicide but is stopped by Emma who manages to help her realize Selene lied to her. Doctor Strange steps in and casts a spell which successfully purges her of Selene&#x27;s corrupting influence. Feeling remorse and guilt over killing for Selene, Blink breaks down and Emma tries to reassure her it wasn&#x27;t her fault and offers to be there for her as well a place with the X-Men. Overwhelmed with emotion, Blink teleports off claiming she can&#x27;t and is last seen looking out into the sunrise in San Francisco.

====&quot;New Mutants&quot;====
Following the Schism event, Cyclops commissions the New Mutants to tie up any loose ends, one of them is finding Blink. Cypher manages to find her, tracking her to a series of natural disasters connected to a band. Working with the New Mutants, they discover the band is being controlled by part of a sentient extraterrestrial ship, creating violent chaos energy as a call for help. After dispatching the sentient ship, Blink is offered the chance of going back to Utopia or Westchester; Blink chooses the latter and joins Wolverine at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.

Blink later visits the New Mutants who were depressed over their recent mission to Paradise Island. Learning that it&#x27;s Warlocks birthday, she teleports the team to Madripoor to celebrate. She later joins the team during their final mission against True Friend, an evil future version of Cypher. She is last seen attending a house party at the New Mutants residence in San Francisco where she assists in helping take down Tyro, Warlock&#x27;s adopted charge.

Blink returned as a resident in New Tian, in &quot;Secret Empire&quot;, along many other mutants, and was later seen drinking at a bar on Krakoa with the &quot;pink Blink&quot; of Earth-295.

=== &quot;What If?&quot; ===

An alternate version of this Blink appears in &quot;What If?&quot; vol. 2 #75. In this story, Blink survives, but the other young mutants die in her place. Blink ends up in the realm of the cosmic entity known as the In-Betweener, and seems to kill him in battle. Blink uses her newfound reality-warping powers to &quot;improve&quot; the world, and among other things causes human/mutant conflict to end. When she attempts to save the members of Generation X from their deaths, the resulting paradox (if Generation X survived, then Blink could never gain her new powers in the first place) caused reality itself to begin disintegrating. Ultimately, Blink undid all the changes she had made, and the In-Betweener revealed that he had not died at all. He then took Blink on as his apprentice, training her in the proper use of her new powers as a new In-Betweener.

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
The &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; version of Blink was seen on a view screen and received passing mention during the selection process for Emma Frost&#x27;s Academy of Tomorrow. However, she was ultimately rejected. Later, Blink is mentioned as having participated and been killed in the premiere episode of a mutant-hunting game show run by Mojo Adams.

<doc id="729604" wikidata="Q8519041" url="?curid=729604" title="Sweat Mountain">
<text>Sweat Mountain is a mountain in far northeastern Cobb County, Georgia, in the suburbs north of Atlanta. The exact GNIS location of its summit is , and it has an official (USGS) elevation of above mean sea level. It is the second-highest point in the county behind Kennesaw Mountain, and second in the core metro Atlanta area, behind Kennesaw Mountain, which is also in Cobb County. It is fifth if the exurban counties further north are considered.

This height has made the mountain very attractive for radio, having several transmitters, radio towers, and antennas, for pagers, cellphones, broadcasting, and amateur radio. The fact that Stone Mountain and Kennesaw Mountain are both protected as parks has led to a proliferation of technology at the top. At the same time, both the antenna farm and the densely packed houses detract from the view of the mountain from surrounding areas of northeast Cobb, south-southeast Cherokee (including much of Woodstock), and western Roswell. 

The presence of the mountain has inspired the naming of a variety of nearby establishments including: Sweat Mountain Park, Mountain View Regional Library, Mountain View Elementary School, and Mountain View United Methodist Church.

Sweat Mountain is also a part of the ridge that divides the Chattahoochee River basin to the south and southeast, from the Lake Allatoona (Etowah River) basin to the north and northwest. From Sweat Mountain, this runs west-southwest through Cobb to Kennesaw Mountain and Lost Mountain.

==History==
At one time the entire mountain was owned by the Wigley family. Henry Clay Wigley continued to live at the base of the mountain for decades. Right across from his house was a gravel road that led to the summit. Years ago, before satellites took over, a U.S. Forest Service ranger would scale a giant fire tower to provide smoke coordinates for fire control every day. With suburbanization, this tower has been removed, but there is a benchmark set in concrete where one of the tower feet once rested. On the most northern side of the summit are natural rock formations, including a natural rock shelter that could house one or two campers.

Wigley Road at one time went from Sandy Plains Road all the way through to Georgia 92, but it was closed in the 1970s due to poor maintenance. The main road now turns off from itself (makes a 90-degree turn) and continues generally west as Jamerson Road. Following the remaining Wigley Road to the dead end, there is a barrow pit just past the barricades. There was a place where natural springs created a huge swampy mudbog in the middle of the Wigley Road, which led to its closing.

In the early 1970s, a lake off Mountain Road at the base of the mountain served as the site for a huge music festival.

In early April 2006, the south side of the mountain was grazed by an F1 tornado, causing relatively minor damage to some homes. The storm moved due east from Noonday to Alpharetta, doing much more serious damage in several other places.

==Broadcasters==

The following broadcast stations are all within 300 meters or 1000 feet of the summit, and are listed with callsign, frequency or channel, community of license, and licensee/owner.

===Radio===
* WBZY FM 105.7 Canton, IHeartMedia
* W265AV FM 100.9 Woodstock, Immanuel Broadcasting Network
*W229AG FM 93.7 Sandy Plains, Calvary Chapel of Twin Falls — now relaying WWWQ FM 99.7 from WWWQ&#x27;s own tower at North Druid Hills
* W201DM FM 88.1, Calvary&#x27;s new station relaying KAWZ from Idaho since April 2014

There are also long-standing applications (potentially moot) for broadcast translators by Calvary Chapel on 94.5 and 103.7 to serve Woodstock. Another application for a translator on 102.1 by Community Public Radio to serve &quot;Sweat Mountain&quot; (which is not a recognized community) is also listed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

===Television===
* WATC-DT 41 (DTV 57.1), Atlanta, Community Television, Inc.
*WSKC-CA 22, Atlanta, KM Communications — silent, digital is now near Norcross
*WXID-LP 49 (originally W55BM), Marietta, Word of God Fellowship (silent, broadcast JCTV under TBN ownership)
*WDWW-LD 7 (briefly-on-air DTV permit for WDWW-LP analog 28 in Cleveland, Georgia), Atlanta, Richard C. &amp; Lisa A. Goetz of Hendersonville, Tennessee

There was also a 50 kW transmitter on former TV channel 55 (700 MHz block D, 716-722 MHz) for MediaFLO, a pay TV service available on mobile TV. It was part of a single-frequency network across the metro area, and all operate under callsign WPZA237 nationally. It was located above ground level of approximately , at , a separate tower from those listed for the other stations above.

A second transmitter on former channel 56 (block E, 722–728 MHz) was used by Manifest Wireless (which, like Dish Network, is a subsidiary of EchoStar). It was also an SFN, and used eight locations in metro Atlanta to transmit an ATSC signal, under callsign WQJY980. ATSC tuners showed high signal strength, however there were no standard MPEG-2 channels available, and it appeared that it would be used for ATSC-M/H, the mobile TV standard for terrestrial television stations. (This is different from the worldwide DVB-SH standard, which is derived from the DVB-S standard that Dish Network has used for DBS since the 1990s.) The signal from Sweat Mountain was active, but no service to the public was ever announced.

<doc id="729607" wikidata="Q3675278" url="?curid=729607" title="Neighborhood Electric Vehicle">
<text>A neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) is an American category for battery electric vehicles that are usually built to have a top speed of , and have a maximum loaded weight of . Depending on the particular laws of the state, they are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits of or less (in some states 45 mph or less). NEVs fall under the United States Department of Transportation classification for low-speed vehicles. The non-electric version of the neighborhood electric vehicle is the motorized quadricycle.

An NEV battery pack recharges by plugging into a standard outlet and because it is an all-electric vehicle it does not produce tailpipe emissions. In the state of California NEVs are classified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) and are eligible for a purchase rebate of up to $1,500 if purchased or leased on or after March 15, 2010.

, the GEM neighborhood electric vehicle was the market leader in North America, with global sales of more than 50,000 units since 1998. Another top selling NEV is the Renault Twizy, launched in March 2012, it was the top-selling plug-in electric vehicle in Europe during 2012, and the heavy quadricycle has sold almost 22,000 units through December 2018.

Sales of low-speed small electric cars (LSEVs) experienced considerable growth in China between 2012 and 2015 due to their affordability and flexibility. A total of 200,000 low-speed small electric cars were sold in China in 2013, most of which are powered by lead-acid batteries. In 2015, sales rose to 750,000 units, and to 1.2 million in 2016. , the stock of LSEVs was estimated to be between 3 million and 4 million units. About 1.4 million low-speed electric vehicles were sold in 2018.

==U.S. regulations==

Low-speed vehicle is a federally approved street-legal vehicle classification which came into existence in 1998 under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 500 (FMVSS 500). There is nothing in the federal regulations specifically pertaining to the powertrain.

Low-speed vehicles are defined as a four-wheeled motor vehicle that has a gross vehicle weight rating of less than and a top speed of between . Those states that authorize NEVs generally restrict their operation to streets with a maximum speed limit of . Because of federal law, car dealers cannot legally sell the vehicles to go faster than , but the buyer can easily modify the car to go . However, if modified to exceed , the vehicle then becomes subject to safety requirements of passenger cars.

These speed restrictions, combined with a typical driving range of per charge and a typical three-year battery durability, are required because of a lack of federally mandated safety equipment and features which NEVs cannot accommodate because of their design. To satisfy federal safety requirements for manufacturers, NEVs must be equipped with three-point seat belts or a lap belt, running lights, headlights, brake lights, reflectors, rear view mirrors, and turn signals. Windshield wipers are not required. In many cases, doors may be optional, crash protection from other vehicles is partially met compared to other non-motorized transport such as bicycles because of the use of seat belts.

===State regulations===

Regulations for operating an NEV vary by state. The federal government allows state and local governments to add additional safety requirements beyond those of Title 49 Part 571.500. For instance, the State of New York requires additional safety equipment to include windshield wipers, window defroster, speedometer, odometer and a back-up light. Generally, they must be titled and registered, and the driver must be licensed. Because airbags are not required the NEV cannot normally travel on highways or freeways.

NEVs in many states are restricted to roads with a speed limit of or less. As of February 2012, NEVs are street-legal in 46 states. In Ohio, NEVs are classified as &quot;low-speed vehicles&quot;, as opposed to golf carts, which are &quot;under-speed vehicles&quot;.

==Community design==
Some communities are designed to separate neighborhoods from commercial and other areas, connecting them with relatively high speed thoroughfares on which NEVs cannot go, legally or safely. As a result, these vehicles are most common in communities that provide separate routes for them or generally accommodate slow speed traffic.

Communities designed specifically with NEVs and similarly sized vehicles in mind include:
*Avalon, California
*Celebration, Florida
*Lady Lake, Florida
*The Villages, Florida 
*Peachtree City, Georgia

Other cities and communities that have adopted NEV-friendly ordinances or have experienced a significant increase of them and street-legal golf cars since 1990 include:
*Alameda, California
*Put-in-Bay, Ohio
*Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California
*Lincoln, California 
*Palm Desert, California
*Sun City, Arizona
*Charleston, South Carolina
*Myrtle Beach, South Carolina
*Coronado, California
*Dunedin, Florida 

==Sales==
;US and Europe

, there were between 60,000 and 76,000 low-speed battery-powered vehicles in use in the United States, up from about 56,000 in 2004. Pike Research estimated there were 478,771 NEVs on the world roads in 2011. The two largest NEV markets in 2011 were the United States, with 14,737 units sold, and France, with 2,231 units.

The different variants of the REVAi, available in 26 countries, sold about 4,600 vehicles worldwide by late 2013, with India and the UK as the main markets. , the GEM neighborhood electric vehicle was the market leader in North America, with global sales of more than 50,000 units since 1998. Another top selling NEV is the Renault Twizy heavy quadricycle, launched in March 2012, with global sales of 15,000 units through April 2015. The Twizy was the top-selling plug-in electric vehicle in Europe during 2012. , a total of 18,592 units had been sold in Europe, representing 96.1% of global sales. Global sales since inception totaled 21,874 units through December 2018.

;China

Sales of low-speed small electric cars experienced considerable growth in China between 2012 and 2015 due to their affordability and flexibility because they can be driven without a driver license. Most of these small electric cars are popular in small cities, but they are expanding to larger cities. A total of 200,000 low-speed small electric cars were sold in China in 2013, most of which are powered by lead-acid batteries. These electric vehicles not considered by the government as new energy vehicles due to safety and environmental concerns, and consequently, do not enjoy the same purchase benefits as highway legal plug-in electric cars.

In 2015, sales of low-speed small electric passenger vehicles in China totaled 750,000 units, and 1.2 million in 2016. , the stock of low-speed small electric car was estimated to be between 3 million and 4 million units. However the sales ratio between LSEVs and passenger NEVs began to decrease beginning in 2015. In 2014, LSEVs sales were 15 times more than normal plug-in passenger cars, but the ratio declined to about four times in 2016, and fell to 2.5 times in 2018, when about 1.1 million normal passenger electric vehicles, compared to 1.4 million low-speed vehicles.

<text>The Fairholme Range is a mountain range east of the Bow River valley in the Canadian Rockies. The range is bounded on the west side by the Trans-Canada Highway as it passes through the towns of Exshaw and Canmore, while the northern section of the range extends into Banff National Park to the southern shores of Lake Minnewanka. John Palliser named the range in 1859 after his sister Grace Fairholme, who had married William Fairholme.

In the spring and summer of 2003, Parks Canada performed a prescribed burn in selected areas of the range in order to reduce fire hazard, manage pine beetle population and increase sheep habitat. In total, 5300 hectares of land were affected.

<doc id="729609" wikidata="Q5420416" url="?curid=729609" title="Exit fare">
<text>An exit fare is a method of collecting ridership fees, or fares, from a transportation system, where the fee (or part of the fee) is collected from passengers upon reaching their destination.

==Examples==
Exit fares were used on the subway lines of the early MBTA in Boston, Massachusetts, as a cost-cutting method to be able to collect increased fares without having to upgrade fare collection equipment at station entrances. The perceived unfairness of this system (what to do with a passenger who can&#x27;t pay the exit fare?) prompted Boston politician Walter A. O&#x27;Brien to commission the protest song &quot;M.T.A.&quot;, which later became a hit song by The Kingston Trio. The last of the subway exit fares were eliminated from the Boston rail transit lines on December 4, 2006, with the implementation of the CharlieCard (its name a reference to the main character in the protest song). However, the MBTA&#x27;s trackless trolley routes that used left-side boarding in the lower bus tunnel at Harvard station had exit fares because fares could not be collected during boarding. With the final two trackless trolley routes being converted to standard bus routes with boarding relocated to the upper bus tunnel at Harvard, exit fares were entirely eliminated from the MBTA system beginning March 13, 2022.

In New York City, this system is used on the AirTrain at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The system uses an exit fare to distinguish between intra-airport trips, which are free, and connections to the subway and commuter rail, which are not. A similar system applies at Orly Airport in Paris, where the Orlyval service is free of charge between the airport&#x27;s terminals, but passengers alighting at Antony station need to pay.

The IND Rockaway Line charged a double fare south of Howard Beach Station which entailed the deposit of two tokens for those entering along the line or one token on exit for those arriving from other parts of the system. The unpopular double fare was abolished in 1975.

Exit fares are also charged on the Staten Island Railway at St. George Terminal and Tompkinsville station, because the primary function of the railway is to transport commuters on Staten Island to/from the Staten Island Ferry terminal at St. George. Commuters heading to Manhattan via the ferry pay upon exiting the train at St. George in the morning, and upon entry at St. George in the afternoon. Exit fares are charged at Tompkinsville because it is also within walking distance of the ferry terminal. Before exit fares were charged at Tompkinsville, one could avoid paying the exit fare at St. George by exiting at Tompkinsville and walking to the ferry terminal. By charging entry and exit fares at St. George and Tompkinsville, the other stations on the Staten Island Railway can be run at far lower cost, without any fare collection equipment or station employees present.

On the Washington Metro, riders process their SmarTrip cards for both entering and exiting the system. The fare is actually deducted from the rider&#x27;s card upon exiting the system based on the time of day and distance traveled. Exitfare machines located near the fare gates allow riders to add additional value to their cards should they lack sufficient value to exit the station at that location.

Bay Area Rapid Transit also uses a similar fare-collecting method, based on distance but not time of day. On BART, while ticket vending machines outside the paid area accept credit and debit cards as well as cash, the Addfare machine inside the paid area, which must be used if the ticket has insufficient value, accepts cash only. Also, the Oakland Airport Connector charges exit fare for riders leaving the airport.

Prior to the fare system being overhauled in 2017, the Port Authority of Allegheny County (since rebranded as Pittsburgh Regional Transit) used exit fares to implement a free ride zone in downtown Pittsburgh. Riders going toward downtown (and on routes that did not enter downtown) paid on entry. Riders leaving downtown before 7 pm paid on exit. Riders traveling entirely within downtown did not pay at all. After 7 pm, no free rides were provided downtown and all trips were charged a fare upon entry. Metro Transit in King County, Washington, used a similar system until it was ended on September 29, 2012, as well as TriMet in Downtown Portland, Oregon from 1975 to 1982, when its Fareless Square went to pay on boarding, with transfers as a fare receipt for those leaving the area.

Many lower-volume point-to-point ticket-based transit services use exit fares in one direction, to avoid the expense of maintaining ticket offices at both ends of the line.

<doc id="729611" wikidata="Q290098" url="?curid=729611" title="Rxvt">
<text>Rxvt (acronym for our extended virtual terminal) is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, and in the form of a Cygwin port, for Windows.

==History==
Rxvt was originally written by Rob Nation and later extensively modified by Mark Olesen, who took over maintenance for several years. It is intended to be a slimmed-down alternate for xterm, omitting some of its little-used features, like Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. The latter refers to the Xt resource mechanism, e.g., for binding keys. Rxvt is an extended version of the older xvt terminal emulator by John Bovey of the University of Kent.

The name originally stood for &quot;Rob&#x27;s xvt&quot; (with XVT stands for &#x27;X Virtual Terminal&#x27;), but was later re-dubbed &quot;our xvt&quot; (pronounced like the letters r-x-v-t).

==Features==

Aside from features such as those controlled by resource files, rxvt&#x27;s terminal emulation differs from xterm in two important ways:
*It emulates a VT102, rather than a VT220. That means that it handles 8-bit data differently, does not implement the C1 controls that xterm does. xterm does implement a switch &quot;-k8&quot; to suppress that functionality; rxvt does not provide an option to emulate a VT220.
*The strings sent for function keys are different. xterm sends strings that are encoded using the same rules as the ANSI/ISO escape sequences. Rxvt&#x27;s do not, though they provide comparable flexibility in this area.

Newer versions of rxvt have primitive support for pseudo-transparency.

The rxvt distribution also includes an analog clock program called rclock. Very old distributions included a copy of vttest, but dropped that in 1996 with version 2.18.

==Forks==
* aterm (from rxvt 2.4.8) created for use with the AfterStep window manager (no longer maintained)
* Eterm (from rxvt 2.21) created for use with Enlightenment
* mrxvt (from rxvt 2.7.11) created for multiple tabs and additional features (latest version released in 2008-09-10)
* urxvt (rxvt-unicode) (from rxvt 2.7.11)
* Wterm, designed for NeXTSTEP style window managers such as Window Maker

<doc id="729612" wikidata="Q125888137" url="?curid=729612" title="Vocable">
<text>In the broadest sense of the word, a vocable (from Latin: &quot;vocabulum&quot;) is any identifiable utterance or writing, such as a word or term, that is fixed by their language and culture. The use of the term for words in the broad sense is archaic and the term is instead used for utterances which are not considered words, such as the English interjections of assent and denial, &quot;uh-huh&quot; and &quot;uh-uh&quot; , or the interjection of error, &quot;uh-oh&quot; .

Such non-lexical vocables are often used in music, for example &quot;la la la&quot; or &quot;dum dee dum&quot;, or in magical incantations, such as &quot;abra-cadabra&quot;. Scat singing is essentially all vocables. Many Native American songs consist entirely of vocables; this may be due to both phonetic substitution to increase the resonance of the song, and to the trade of songs between nations speaking different languages. Jewish Nigunim also feature wordless melodies composed entirely of vocables such as &quot;Yai nai nai&quot; or &quot;Yai dai dai&quot;.

Vocables are common as pause fillers, such as &quot;um&quot; and &quot;er&quot; in English, where they have little formal meaning and are rarely purposeful.

Pseudowords that mimic the structure of real words are used in experiments in psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology, for example the nonsense syllables introduced by Hermann Ebbinghaus.

The proto-words of infants, which are meaningful but do not correspond to words of adult speech, are also sometimes called vocables.

<doc id="729617" wikidata="Q3183841" url="?curid=729617" title="Jorge Julio">
<text>Jorge Dandys Julio Tapia (born March 3, 1979) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball relief pitcher. He previously played for the Baltimore Orioles from 2001 to 2005, New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks in 2006, and the Florida Marlins in 2007 before being traded to the Rockies for Byung-hyun Kim. He had brief stints with the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves in 2008, and also with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2009. He bats and throws right-handed.

== Career ==
=== Montreal Expos===
Julio signed with the Montreal Expos on February 14, 1996. He played in their minor league organization until he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Ryan Minor on December 22, 2000.

=== Baltimore Orioles ===
Julio&#x27;s first season in the majors was 2001 with the Orioles, in which he compiled a record of 1 win and 1 loss with a 3.80 ERA in 21.1 innings pitched; however, Julio&#x27;s first full season in the majors was 2002, in which he went 5–6, posting a 1.99 ERA with 25 saves and 55 strikeouts in 68 innings. He finished third in the American League Rookie of the Year voting with 1 second-place vote and 11 third-place votes. However, he was unable to duplicate his rookie season success in the seasons that followed and eventually lost his job as the Orioles closer to B. J. Ryan at the end of 2004. Julio began 2005 as the set-up man for Ryan. During April of that season, he allowed just one earned run in innings pitched; despite that, his performance declined and he finished the season 3–5 with a 5.90 ERA in 67 appearances.

Pitching coach Fred Stackson has commented that Julio is gaining consistency with his delivery, especially to right-handed batters. In 55 games 55 innings of relief he went 0-1 with a 1.15 ERA with 57 strikeouts and 28 saves.

In January 2011, he agreed to a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but he did not pitch in 2011. He returned to Bridgeport in 2012. In 19 games 18.2 innings of relief he went 0-1 with a 6.27 ERA with 13 strikeouts and 8 saves.

==Pitching style==
Julio threw extremely hard, featuring both a four-seam and a two-seam fastball in the 95–100 MPH range - though he has thrown even harder on occasion. He also had a downward-breaking slider, which comes in at between 86 and 90 MPH, and occasionally threw a changeup as well.

<text>Anûkathâ Îpa (, , &#x27;Bald Eagle Peak&#x27;, sometimes written in English language sources as &quot;Anû Kathâ Îpa&quot;) is an outlier of Mount Charles Stewart in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta. It is one of the most prominent landmarks in the vicinity of Canmore, Alberta.

Anûkathâ Îpa is the official name for the high point of a ridge that lies southwest of the Mount Charles Stewart summit and northwest of Mount Lady Macdonald near Canmore.
The peak was formerly known by a racist and misogynistic nickname, because of its resemblance to a woman&#x27;s breast. It is part of a larger formation that has the appearance of a woman lying on her back, including a face, hair, and the general shape of a body, which adds to the resemblance.

On August 20, 2020 it was reported that the prominence would be renamed to avoid racist and misogynistic naming. The Stoney Nakoda people were asked to help select a culturally appropriate name and a request to support the initiative was brought to the Municipal District of Bighorn in September 2020. It was officially renamed on September 29, 2020. 

Belonging to the Fairholme Range in Kananaskis Provincial Park, Anûkathâ Îpa is above the Bow River valley. It is northwest of Lady Macdonald, just east of the Banff National Park gates.
==Routes==
For climbers, a scrambling route is graded moderate but includes exposure, so the ascent is not recommended in wet conditions. Climbers are advised to follow the major drainage ditch behind Harvie Heights and stay close along the right (south) side of the ditch, and then to follow this up to the North West ridge all the way to the slabs just below the summit.

<doc id="729623" wikidata="Q2110883" url="?curid=729623" title="1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak">
<text>The 1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak was the largest outbreak of smallpox in Europe after the Second World War. It was centered in Kosovo, a province of Serbia within Yugoslavia, and the capital city of Belgrade. A Kosovar Albanian Muslim pilgrim had contracted the smallpox virus in the Middle East. Upon returning to his home in Kosovo, he started the epidemic in which 175 people were infected, killing 35. The epidemic was efficiently contained by enforced quarantine and mass vaccination. The 1982 film &quot;Variola Vera&quot; is based on the event.

== Background ==
By 1972 the disease was considered to be eradicated in Europe. The population of Yugoslavia had been regularly vaccinated for 50 years, and the last case was reported in 1930. This was the major cause of the initial slow reaction by doctors, who did not promptly recognize the disease.

In October 1970, an Afghan family went on pilgrimage from Afghanistan, where smallpox was endemic, to Mashhad in Iran, triggering an epidemic of smallpox in Iran that would last until September 1972. By late 1971, smallpox-infected pilgrims had carried smallpox from Iran into Syria and Iraq.

== Outbreak ==

In early 1972, a 38-year-old Kosovo Albanian Muslim clergyman named Ibrahim Hoti, from Damnjane near Đakovica, Kosovo, undertook the Hajj. He visited holy sites in Iraq, where cases of smallpox were known. He returned home on February 15. The following morning he suffered aches and was tired. After feeling feverish for a couple of days and developing a rash, he recovered, likely because he had been vaccinated two months earlier.

On March 3, Latif Mumdžić, a thirty-year-old teacher, who had just arrived in Đakovica to attend school, fell ill. He had no known direct contact with Hoti. He may have been infected by one of the clergyman&#x27;s friends or relatives who visited during his illness, or simply by passing the clergyman in the street. When Mumdžić visited the local medical center two days later, doctors attempted to treat his fever with penicillin (smallpox is a virus, so this was ineffective). His condition did not improve, and after a couple of days, his brother took him to the hospital in Čačak, 150 km to the north in Serbia. The doctors there could not help him, so he was transferred by ambulance to the central hospital in Belgrade. On March 9, Mumdžić was shown to medical students and staff as a case of an atypical reaction to penicillin, which was a plausible explanation for his condition. On the following day, Mumdžić suffered massive internal bleeding and, despite efforts to save his life, died that evening. The cause of death was listed as &quot;reaction to penicillin&quot;. In fact, he had contracted &quot;Hemorrhagic Smallpox &quot;, a highly contagious form of smallpox. Before his death, Mumdžić directly infected 38 people (including nine doctors and nurses), eight of whom died. A few days after Mumdžić&#x27;s death, 140 smallpox cases erupted across Kosovo province. On 16 March, the smallpox virus was isolated in Belgrade by Ana Gligić, the head of the national smallpox laboratory, which was followed by strict measures that prevented the spread of the disease in the city and thus a major disaster.

== Reaction ==
The government&#x27;s reaction was swift. Martial law was declared on March 16. Measures included &quot;cordons sanitaires&quot; of villages and neighborhoods, roadblocks, a prohibition of public assembly, closure of borders and prohibition of all non-essential travel. Hotels were requisitioned for quarantines in which 10,000 people who may have been in contact with the virus were held under guard by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army.

Mumdžić&#x27;s brother developed a smallpox rash on March 20, resulting in medical authorities realizing that Mumdžić had died of smallpox. The authorities undertook massive revaccination of the population, helped by the World Health Organization (WHO), &quot;almost the entire Yugoslavian population of 18 million people was vaccinated&quot;. Leading experts on smallpox were flown in to help, including Donald Henderson and Don Francis.

By mid-May, the outbreak was contained and the country returned to normal life. During the epidemic, 175 people contracted smallpox and 35 died.

== Legacy ==
The Yugoslav government received international praise for the successful containment of the epidemic, which was one of the finest hours for Donald Henderson and the WHO, as well as one of the crucial steps in the eradication of smallpox.

In 1982, Serbian director Goran Marković made the film &quot;Variola Vera&quot; about a hospital under quarantine during the epidemic.

<doc id="729629" wikidata="Q9078359" url="?curid=729629" title="Snowball (Animal Farm)">
<text>Snowball is a character in George Orwell&#x27;s 1945 novella &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. He is largely based on Leon Trotsky, who led the opposition against Joseph Stalin (Napoleon). Snowball is depicted as an intellectual white pig whose leadership, dedication, and feats for Animal Farm is unparallel to any others on the farm, however he is rivaled by Napoleon who has hatred for Snowball. In the 1954 film adaptation of &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, he was voiced by Maurice Denham, and was voiced by Kelsey Grammer in the 1999 television adaptation.

==Biography==
Snowball believes in a continued revolution: he argues that to defend Animal Farm, he must strengthen the reality of Old Major&#x27;s dream of a life without humans and that they must stir up rebellions in other farms throughout England. However, Napoleon always disagrees with any ideas that Snowball has because he does not want Snowball to lead Animal Farm, wanting to lead it himself with an iron fist.

Snowball writes the Seven Commandments for Animal Farm, which are later altered by Squealer under the orders of Napoleon, to accommodate the actions of the pigs; the commandment stating &quot;No animal shall drink alcohol&quot; is changed to &quot;No animal shall drink alcohol &quot;to excess&quot;&quot;, &quot;No animal shall sleep in a bed&quot; has been changed to &quot;No animal shall sleep in a bed &quot;with sheets&quot;&quot;, and &quot;No animal shall kill another animal&quot; is changed to &quot;No animal shall kill another animal &quot;without cause&quot;&quot;. Later all the commandments are replaced with one phrase: &quot;All animals are equal&quot;, but some animals are more equal than others&quot;&quot;.

Once Napoleon gains control of Animal Farm he uses his guard dogs to attack Snowball, who flees to an unknown fate (in the 1954 film, he is killed), and manipulates the farm into believing what Snowball had done before was the cause of problems for the farm. Though Snowball had fought bravely for Animal Farm at the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon alters his account of the events to say Snowball had openly fought for Jones. Napoleon then conducts a purge of Snowball&#x27;s supporters and has them executed as conspirators.

==Historical parallels with Trotsky==
Orwell depicts Snowball in a sympathetic manner and superior to Napoleon in regards to personal intellect, rhetorical skills, economic theories, literary writings and military leadership. Orwell also highlighted the growing antagonism from Napoleon and Snowball such as the former’s frequent criticisms of Snowball’s economic plans, his eventual appropriation of the plans and later efforts to falsify history upon the latter’s exile. The personality traits and eventual defeat of Snowball mirrored the life of his historical counterpart Trotsky, including his contributions to the early Soviet Union and forced exile.

Yet, Orwell remained skeptical of any substantial differences between Snowball and Napoleon as he expressed the view to his friend George Woodcock: &quot;Trotsky-Snowball was potentially as big a villain as Stalin-Napoleon, although he was Napoleon’s victim. The first note of corruption was struck when the pigs secretly had the cows’ milk added to their own mash and Snowball consented to this first act of inequity.”

However, literary critic Jeffrey Meyers who reviewed the political allegories in Orwell’s work stated that: 

&quot;Orwell ignores the fact that Trotsky passionately opposed Stalin’s dictatorship from 1924 to 1940, which featured Siberian prison camps, the deliberately created Ukraine famine and the massive slaughter during the Moscow Purge Trials of 1937.” 

Meyers also added that Orwell drew on the views of a right-wing combatant to reinforce his arguments. In contrast, Meyers cited historian Isaac Deutscher&#x27;s biographical account of Trotsky which presented him to be a much more civilised figure than Stalin and suggested that he would not have purged the Red Army generals or millions of Soviet citizens.

==In adaptations and pop culture==
In the 1999 live-action film adaptation, he is shown escaping the dogs and surviving, though Napoleon declares him banished under pain of death. The later live-action adaptation portrays the character more accurately to the book, including his survival.

In the film &quot;American Psycho&quot;, Patrick Bateman&#x27;s girlfriend introduces him to a pig she received as a present called Snowball.

When the novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot; was adapted for the screen in the 1950s, the CIA investors were greatly concerned that Snowball was presented too sympathetically in early script treatments and that Batchelor&#x27;s script implied Snowball was &quot;intelligent, dynamic, courageous&quot;. A memo declared that Snowball must be presented as a &quot;fanatic intellectual whose plans if carried through would have led to disaster no less complete than under Napoleon.&quot; De Rochemont subsequently implemented these changes. The film, unlike the book, shows him being killed by the dogs, likely due to related pressure. Snowball&#x27;s death mirrors the assassination of Leon Trotsky.

The parody sequel novel &quot;Snowball&#x27;s Chance&quot; depicts Snowball&#x27;s return to the farm following Napoleon&#x27;s death, and portrays him as having become a capitalist whose leadership mirrors the United States instead of Soviet Russia, culminating in him declaring war on a community of fanatical woodland animals after they destroy twin windmills built under his rule.

In the 2020 action horror film &quot;The Hunt&quot;, the characters allude to &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, with the main antagonist referring to the main protagonist as Snowball.

<doc id="729644" wikidata="Q3400089" url="?curid=729644" title="Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain">
<text>The Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Welsh: &quot;Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain&quot;) are a series of items in late-medieval Welsh tradition. Lists of the items appear in texts dating to the 15th and 16th centuries. The number of treasures is always given as thirteen, but some later versions list different items, replacing or combining entries to maintain the number.

==List==

The various treasures (&quot;tlws&quot;) include vessels or utensils for food and drink (hamper, cauldron, crock and dish, horn and knife), objects relating to weaponry (sword, whetstone) and to transport (halter, chariot), clothing (coat, mantle) and still other items (stone and ring, chessboard). Most of the items are placed in the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; or &quot;Old North&quot;, the Brittonic-speaking parts of what is now southern Scotland and Northern England; some early manuscripts refer to the whole list specifically as treasures &quot;that were in the North&quot;. 

The number of treasures is always given as thirteen, but some later versions list different items, replacing or combining entries to maintain the number. Later versions also supplement the plainlist with explanatory comments about each treasure. The standard version of the list includes the following treasures:

# White-Hilt, the Sword of Rhydderch Hael (&quot;Dyrnwyn, gleddyf Rhydderch Hael&quot;): &quot;if a well-born man drew it himself, it burst into flame from its hilt to its tip. And everyone who used to ask for it would receive; but because of this peculiarity everyone used to reject it. And therefore he was called Rhydderch the Generous.&quot;
# The Hamper of Gwyddno Garanhir (&quot;Mwys Gwyddno Garanir&quot;): food for one man would be put in it, and when it was opened, food for a hundred men would be found in it.
# The Horn of Brân Galed from the North (&quot;Corn Brân Galed o&#x27;r Gogledd&quot;): whatever drink might be wished for was found in it.
# The Chariot of Morgan Mwynfawr (&quot;Car Morgan Mwynfawr&quot;): if a man went in it, he might wish to be wherever he would, and he would be there quickly.
# The Halter of Clydno Eiddyn (&quot;Cebystr Clydno Eiddin&quot;): which was fixed to a staple at the foot of his bed: whatever horse he might wish for, he would find in the halter.
# The Knife of Llawfrodedd Farchog (&quot;Cyllell Llawfrodedd Farchog&quot;): which would serve for twenty-four men to eat at table.
# The Cauldron of Dyrnwch the Giant (&quot;Pair Dyrnwch Gawr&quot;): if meat for a coward were put in it to boil, it would never boil; but if meat for a brave man were put in it, it would boil quickly (and thus the brave could be distinguished from the cowardly).
# The Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd (&quot;Hogalen Tudwal Tudclyd&quot;): if a brave man sharpened his sword on the whetstone, then the sword would certainly kill any man from whom it drew blood. If a cowardly man used the whetstone, though, his sword would refuse to draw blood at all.
# The Coat of Padarn Beisrudd (&quot;Pais Badarn Beisrydd&quot;): if a well-born man put it on, it would be the right size for him; if a churl, it would not go upon him.
# The Crock and the Dish of Rhygenydd the Cleric (&quot;Gren a desgyl Rhygenydd Ysgolhaig&quot;): whatever food might be wished for in them, it would be found.
# The Chessboard of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio (&quot;Gwyddbwyll Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio&quot;): if the pieces were set, they would play by themselves. The board was of gold, and the men of silver.
# The Mantle of Arthur in Cornwall (&quot;Llen Arthyr yng Nghernyw&quot;): whoever was under it could not be seen, and he could see everyone.
# The Mantle of Tegau Gold-Breast (Tegau Eurfron, wife of Caradoc): Her mantle would not serve for any woman who had violated her marriage or her virginity. It would reach to the ground when worn by a faithful woman but would only hang down to the lap of an unfaithful wife.

Later lists also include two additional treasures, the Mantle of Tegau Eurfon, and Eluned&#x27;s Stone and Ring. Where these appear, one of the other treasures is dropped and the Crock and the Dish of Rhygenydd the Cleric are counted as one item. The new items come from literary, rather than traditional, material; the Mantle comes from a version of the Caradoc story, while Eluned&#x27;s stone and ring come from the prose tale &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot;.

==Description==

Some of the magical objects listed can be shown to have earlier origins in Welsh narrative tradition. Items 1, 2 and 7, for instance, are also described in the Middle Welsh tale &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot; (tentatively dated to &quot;c&quot;. 1100), in which Ysbaddaden the Giant gives King Arthur&#x27;s cousin Culhwch a list of impossible tasks (&quot;anoetheu&quot;) which he has to complete in order to win the hand of Olwen, the giant&#x27;s daughter.

===&quot;Dyrnwyn&quot;, the Sword of Rhydderch Hael===
The &quot;Dyrnwyn&quot; (&quot;White-Hilt&quot;) is said to be a powerful sword belonging to Rhydderch Hael, one of the Three Generous Men of Britain mentioned in the Welsh Triads. When drawn by a worthy or well-born man, the entire blade would blaze with fire. Rhydderch was never reluctant to hand the weapon to anyone, hence his nickname &quot;Hael&quot; meaning &quot;the Generous&quot;, but the recipients, as soon as they had learned of its peculiar properties, always rejected the sword.

===The Hamper of Gwyddno Garanhir===
It is told that Gwyddno Garanhir (&quot;Long-shank&quot;) possessed a hamper (&quot;mwys&quot;) which would multiply food: if one was to put food for one man in the basket and open it again, the food was found to be increased a hundredfold.

===The Horn of Brân Galed===
The Horn of Brân Galed (&quot;the Stingy&quot; or &quot;the Niggard&quot;) from the North is said to have possessed the magical property of ensuring that &quot;whatever drink might be wished for was found in it&quot;. Marginal notes to the text in Peniarth MS 147 (&quot;c&quot;. 1566) elaborate on this brief entry by saying that Myrddin had approached the kings and lords of Britain to request their treasures. They consented on the condition that he obtained the horn of Brân Galed, supposing that the task would be impossible to fulfill (whether owing to Brân&#x27;s reputation for being close-fisted or for some other reason). However, Myrddin somehow succeeded in obtaining the drinking horn and so received the other treasures as well. He took his hoard to the &quot;Glass House&quot; (&quot;Tŷ Gwydr&quot;), where it would remain forever. Tracing the prehistory of the horn to the Greek mythological past, the same notes tell that Hercules had removed the horn from the head of the centaur he had slain, whose wife then killed the hero in bloody revenge.

The discrepancy between Brân&#x27;s nickname (&quot;the Stingy&quot;) and the special property of the enchanted horn appears to be explained by the Welsh poet Guto&#x27;r Glyn, who lived in the mid-15th century and was therefore contemporary with the earliest attestations of the &quot;Tri Thlws ar Ddeg&quot;. He relates that Brân Galed was a northern nobleman, whom Taliesin transformed into a man superior to the Tri Hael, i.e. the three most generous men in Britain according to one of the Welsh Triads. Later bards to allude to the treasure include Tudur Aled and Iorwerth Fynglwyd.

The identity of Brân Galed (not to be confused with Brân the Blessed) is uncertain. His northern background, which is usually described in general terms, is specified in one place elsewhere. A 16th-century note written by the scribe Gruffudd Hiraethog (died 1564) identifies Brân as the son of one &quot;Emellyr&quot;, which appears to refer to the Brân son of Ymellyrn who is depicted in the Llywarch Hen cycle of poems as an opponent of the kings of Rheged. The latter has also been equated with the Brân fighting at Cynwyd (northern Wales) in the poem &quot;Gwarchan Tudfwlch&quot;, possibly against Owain of Rheged.

===The Chariot of Morgan Mwynfawr===
The chariot belonging to Morgan Mwynfawr (&quot;the Wealthy&quot;) is described as a magical vehicle which would quickly reach whatever destination one might wish to go to.

===The Halter of Clydno Eiddyn===

Belonged to Clydno Eiddyn (Cebystr Clydno Eiddin). It was fixed to a staple at the foot of his bed. Whatever horse he might wish for, he would find in the halter. The Halter of Clydno Eiddyn was also called The Handy Halter, for it summons fine horses.

===The Knife of Llawfrodedd the Horseman===
Llawfrodedd Farchog (from &quot;marchog&quot; &quot;the Horseman&quot;), or &quot;Barfawc&quot; &quot;the Bearded&quot; in other manuscripts, is said to have owned a knife which would serve for a company of 24 men at the dinner table.

===The Cauldron of Dyrnwch the Giant===
The cauldron (&quot;pair&quot;) of Dyrnwch the Giant is said to discriminate between cowards and brave men: whereas it would not boil meat for a coward, it would boil quickly if that meat belonged to a brave man. The description probably goes back to a story similar to that found in the Middle Welsh tale &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;, in which the cauldron of Diwrnach the Irishman, steward (&quot;maer&quot;) to Odgar son of Aedd, King of Ireland, is among the &quot;anoetheu&quot; which Culhwch is required to obtain for the wedding banquet. King Arthur requests the cauldron from King Odgar, but Diwrnach refuses to give up his prized possession. Arthur goes to visit Diwrnach in Ireland, accompanied by a small party, and is received at his house, but when Diwrnach refuses to answer Arthur&#x27;s request a second time, Bedwyr (Arthur&#x27;s champion) seizes the cauldron and entrusts it to one of Arthur&#x27;s servants, who is to carry the load on his back. In a single sweep with the sword called Caledfwlch, Llenlleawg the Irishman kills off Diwrnach and all his men. A confrontation with Irish forces ensues, but Arthur and his men fight them off. They board their ship Prydwen and, taking with them the cauldron loaded with the spoils of war, return to Britain.

In &quot;Culhwch&quot;, Diwrnach&#x27;s cauldron is not attributed with any special power. However, the earlier poem &quot;Preiddeu Annwfn&quot; (&quot;The Spoils of Annwfn&quot;), refers to an adventure by Arthur and his men to obtain a cauldron with magical properties equivalent to the one in the lists of the thirteen treasures. In this poem the owner of the cauldron is not an Irish lord but the king of Annwn, the Welsh Otherworld, suggesting that the version of the story in &quot;Culhwch&quot; is a later attempt to euhemerize an older tale.

Diwrnach&#x27;s name, which derives from Irish &quot;Diugurach&quot; and exhibits no literary provenance, may have been selected by the author of &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot; to emphasize the Irish setting of his story. Although Dyrnwch is not himself described as an Irishman, it is probable that his name goes back to &quot;Diwrnach&quot;. The extant manuscripts of &quot;Tri Thlws ar Ddeg&quot; also present such variant spellings as &quot;Dyrnog&quot; and &quot;Tyrnog&quot;, without the Irish-sounding ending, but on balance, these are best explained as Welsh approximations of a foreign name.

===The Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd===
Sharpens the blade of a fine warrior. It shall draw blood from any enemy of its user if its user be brave; if its user shall be cowardly, then the blade shall not be sharpened and draw no blood whatsoever.

===The Coat of Padarn Beisrudd===
Padarn&#x27;s coat perfectly fits any brave man; will not fit cowards.

===The Crock and Dish of Rhygenydd Ysgolhaig===
Belonged to Rhygenydd the Cleric. Whatever food might be wished for in them, it would be found on them.

===Chessboard of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio ===
Rather large chess board with pieces of silver and crystal and the board made of gold. The pieces only play by themselves if all the pieces are set up correctly.

===The Mantle of Arthur in Cornwall===
King Arthur&#x27;s &quot;llen&quot; or mantle is said to make anyone underneath it invisible, though able to see out. This item is known from two other sources, the prose tales &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; (c. 1100) and &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot; (early 13th century). A very similar mantle also appears in the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, in which it is used by Caswallawn to assassinate the seven stewards left behind by Brân the Blessed and usurp the throne.

In &quot;Culhwch&quot; Arthur&#x27;s mantle is included in the list of the only things Arthur will not give to the protagonist Culhwch, but it is not named specifically or otherwise described. However, the names of several of the other items contain the element &quot;gwyn&quot;, meaning &quot;white; sacred; blessed&quot;, suggesting otherworldly connections for the whole list. In &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;, the mantle is specifically named Gwenn, and has properties analogous to those given in the lists of the Thirteen Treasures, though here it is those on top of the mantle who are made invisible.

===The Mantle of Tegau Gold-Breast===
Tegau Gold-Breast (Tegau Eurfron, wife of Caradoc) was a Welsh heroine. Her mantle would not serve for any woman who had violated her marriage or her virginity. It would reach to the ground when worn by a faithful woman but would only hang down to the lap of an unfaithful wife.

===The Stone and Ring of Eluned the Fortunate===
One might describe it as a ring of invisibility. It&#x27;s said that Merlin once possessed this item for a while.

<doc id="729657" wikidata="Q3249537" url="?curid=729657" title="List of birds of Metropolitan France">
<text>This list of birds species recorded in Metropolitan France. The avifauna of France includes a total of 671 species according to the Birds of France website (oiseaux.net). One is endemic to the island of Corsica.

Metropolitan France is the French mainland, adjacent islands, and Corsica. There is also a specific list for the birds of Corsica. For the birds in the French Overseas territories, see: List of birds of French Guiana, List of birds of French Polynesia, List of birds of Guadeloupe, List of birds of Martinique, List of birds of Réunion, and List of birds of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

This list&#x27;s taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (English and scientific names) are those of the IOC World Bird List, Version 14.2 (2024).

Bird species admitted to the French List are included in the following categories A, B or C, with the same definitions as the British and other Western Palaearctic bird lists. These are sourced from the 2021 edition of the French list, which followed the IOC World Bird List, Version 11.1 (2021).
*A: species that have been recorded in an apparently natural state at least once since 1 January 1950.
*B: species that were recorded in an apparently natural state at least once between 1 January 1800 and 31 December 1949, but have not been recorded subsequently.
*C: species introduced by humans, and have established breeding populations derived from introduced stock, which maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction.
==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl==

<text>Grant&#x27;s is a blended Scotch whisky, produced by the company William Grant &amp; Sons in Scotland.

It is the world&#x27;s third highest selling Scotch whisky.

== History ==

In 1886, William Grant started working in the distillery business as a bookkeeper. In 1898, Pattisons, the largest Scotch whisky blender at the time, went bankrupt, and William Grant stepped in and launched Grant&#x27;s whisky. William built the Glenfiddich distillery in Dufftown, Scotland, with the help of his seven sons and two daughters. On Christmas Day 1887, it produced its first product.

Later, William&#x27;s son-in-law Charles Gordon became the company&#x27;s first salesman, and in 1909, he spent a year taking Grant&#x27;s to Australia and the far east. In 1915, a new law stated that the minimum maturation period for Scotch whisky was to be two years (today it is three). While this led to the ruin of many Scotch whisky distilleries, William Grant had kept a supply of aging whisky in stock and was able to ensure continuous production.

William Grant died in 1923 but by this time, the family business was already established. In 1963, William&#x27;s great-grandson Charles Gordon, oversaw construction of the Girvan grain distillery. In 1979, Grant&#x27;s UK sales surpassed 1-million cases for the first time. Today, Grant&#x27;s continues to be family-owned and operated. The current CEO, Glenn Gordon, is the fifth generation of the family to lead the business.

Grant&#x27;s is the oldest family-owned blended whisky and is currently sold in over 180 countries. It is the world&#x27;s fourth largest Scotch whisky brand, selling 4.1 million cases of whisky in the first half of 2020. The mother company, William Grant &amp; Sons also owns single malt whisky brands, including Glenfiddich and The Balvenie.

== Bottle ==

Beginning in 1957, Grant&#x27;s is sold in a bottle that has a triangular cross section. The designer, Hans Schleger, came to Britain as a refugee from Nazi Germany. He was asked to create a distinctive, elegant bottle that would showcase the quality and colour of the whisky as well being able to be stacked and packed efficiently. The triangular-shaped bottle was first used in 1956 for Glenfiddich Single Malt Scotch, also owned by William Grant &amp; Sons.

In 2002, the Grant&#x27;s bottle and label were both updated. This included embossing the bottle with the Grant coat of arms and the motto &quot;Stand Fast&quot; – the war cry of Clan Grant, to which William belonged. The words &quot;Est. 1887&quot; and &quot;Independent Family Distillers for Five Generations&quot; were also added.

== Whiskies ==

Grant&#x27;s blended whiskies are made using grain whisky from the Girvan distillery as the invariant base, with which a variety of single malts and other grain whiskies are blended. The full range includes the Grant&#x27;s Triple Wood, Triple Wood Smoky, Ale Cask Finish, Rum Cask Finish, 8 Year Old Sherry Cask Finish, Triple Wood 12 Year Old, Rare 18 Year Old and the 25 Year Old blended Scotch whiskies.

* Grant&#x27;s Triple Wood Blended Scotch Whisky - Grant&#x27;s Family Reserve was renamed Grant&#x27;s Triple Wood in 2018 and is described as having a complex, clean and fruity taste. Jim Murray praised this blend, “It defies the odds for quality” in his Whisky Bible 2010. The ABV percentage of this blend is 40%.
* Grant’s Triple Wood Smoky - is said to have a sweet fruitiness and hints of citrus, finishing with smoke and a “touch of dry tannin”.
* Grant&#x27;s Ale Cask Finish - the only Scotch finished in ale casks, giving it a taste described as creamy, malty and honeyed.
* Grant&#x27;s Rum Cask Finish - aged in oak barrels before being matured further in ex-Caribbean-style rum barrels, and is said to have notes of tropical fruits, banana, vanilla oak and a touch of sweet spice.
* Grant&#x27;s 8 Year Old Sherry Cask Finish - finishes its maturation in oak casks that have previously held Oloroso sherry. The whisky is described as having vanilla sweetness and rich malty notes, accentuated dried fruits and wood spices.
* Grant&#x27;s Triple Wood 12 Year Old Whisky - the reworked and renamed Grant&#x27;s 12 Year Old Whisky, blended in three types of oak casks: a Sherry cask, an American Oak cask and a Bourbon refill. The constituent whiskies have matured for a minimum of 12 years.
* Grant&#x27;s Rare 18 Year Old Whisky - a Scotch whisky described as rich and full bodied with fruity port notes.
* Grant&#x27;s 25 Year Old Whisky - a blend of 25 malt and grain whiskies, including the first ever whisky laid down at Grant&#x27;s Girvan distillery. It is described as having a smooth, singular sweetness.

<text>Sisal () is a seaport town in Hunucmá Municipality in the state of Yucatán, Mexico. It was the principal port of Yucatán during the henequen boom, later overshadowed when the more modern port of Progreso was built to the east. It lent its name to the agave-derived sisal fiber which was shipped through this port.

The town is about 53 km north north-west of Mérida, the state capital. By law when the Yucatán was part of New Spain, all commerce went through the port of Campeche. The residents of Mérida petititioned for a port closer to the capital, and this was granted by Spanish royal decree on 13 February 1810. The new port of Sisal was founded in 1811, and has a late colonial era fortress, the &quot;Fuerte de Santiago&quot; which incorporates an old lighthouse. After Yucatán&#x27;s independence from Spain commerce in the port grew rapidly, and by 1845 was shipping cargos with twice the value that had previously gone through Campeche. After the development of Progreso, Sisal&#x27;s importance declined and today is a small fishing village, visited by some for its beach.

As of the Mexican census of 2010, Sisal had an official population of 1,837 inhabitants. As of December 2006 the state government is working to return this port to the splendor of centuries past through the development of projects focused on tourism as declared then-governor Patricio Patron Laviada. With the planning being done by a U.S. company and to be developed during the next governing term, the port is planned to grow into a tourist destination as well as shelterport for fishermen and tourist vessels.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian===
The ancient groups that inhabited the coasts of the Yucatán peninsula in pre-Hispanic times, were fundamentally related to the villages and the great Mayan ceremonial centers of the inland. There is evidence that shows the journey that these groups made to explore the coasts and trade, salt, fish, fabrics, ceramic utensils and other products.

===Manor of Ah-Canul===
In an ancient Mayan document known as the Calkiní Codex the migration of the Canul brothers is narrated and presented in a description of the limits of the Maya province of Lord Ah-Canul of the north, of which Sisal was a part and the origins are mentioned of this port. The oldest quote points out that the Maya priest Ah-Kin Canul had four boats here in which they fished their slaves and probably served for trade with other indigenous populations of the Gulf of Mexico to the Caribbean Sea. This happened during the late post-classic period (1250-1517), when the coasts began to populate, allowing to stand out as one of the main maritime trade ports of the Mayan region.

===Initial population===
There are archaeological evidences that reveal the existence of the Maya settlement prior to the Spanish conquest. It is possible that it was a town from another region that established itself here and created alliances with other ports in the area for trade and thus expand its power. It seems that the first settlers arrived at the northeast corner of the Yucatán peninsula around 700 BC. of C. Ethnically, it is believed that they were Mayan groups that already had an advanced socio-cultural organization and an elaborate ceramic tradition. Sisal and other coastal sites in northeastern Yucatán formed parts of the long-distance exchange networks that Chichén Itzá established with the Gulf of Mexico. There were small fishing villages and salt collectors in Chuburná Puerto and Sisal.

===Occupation in the colonial period===
The port of Sisal was occupied by the field marshal, Pedro de Ballesteros in 1585. He received the name &quot;Santa María de Zizal&quot;, which was granted him by Fray Diego López de Cogolludo. The name of Sisal comes from the Mayan meaning &quot;Place where the cold is heavy and penetrating&quot;. Other meanings attributed to the name of the port are: &quot;Freshness and shade made by large trees&quot; and &quot;son or daughter of a woman&quot;. As in the pre-Hispanic era, Sisal had commercial and political importance during the Colony. Here cotton, dye stick, tobacco and scarlet were sold, as well as the Yucatecan henequen that was exported from this port, which is why the agave fiber is called sisal or sisalana in other latitudes.

===Commercial Importance===
Sisal was declared a minor port on 3 March 1811. Previously, in 1798, it was granted absolute freedom of rights for direct trade with Spain as in the interior from port to port. Sisal acquired great importance after that appointment, because the Merida trade and the peninsula with Spain and Cuba, was made by this place. The good situation did not last long, due to the poor conditions of the port, in addition to the roads in poor condition that led to Merida, made the transit of goods inadequate. Another disadvantage was the lack of sufficient defenses in the case of being attacked by pirates. Sisal was connected to Mérida by a road of 53 km finished in 1564, but the swamp made the route difficult, unlike Campeche, which finally dominated the communication to the sea. In any case, due to its economic impotence, Sisal was declared a town in 1840, being the seat of the City Council that controlled the Yucatán coast from Celestún to Isla Mujeres. The appointment was proclaimed by Benito Pérez Valdelomar, governor of Yucatán. In the middle of the 18th century, the port of Sisal was already in third place due to the number of its exports, second only to Carmen and Campeche.

===First colonial constructions===
Because of the attacks and assaults of pirates, it was necessary to leave many ports during the second half of the sixteenth century. Sisal did not suffer the same fate thanks to the construction of the Fort of Santiago, whose plans were drawn in 1596 by Juan Miguel Agüero, who completed the construction of the Cathedral of Mérida in 1598. With protection, by 1765 the existence of a peninsular trade between Campeche, Sisal and Mérida, based on beeswax, leather, copal, ebony and dye stick. However, the strong performance of the fort, the commercial activity of Sisal would decline over 150 years, and it has not been possible to recover.

===Another way===
Mérida-Sisal was built by Diego de Quijada in the middle of the 18th century, making clear the need that at that time had to enable a port closer to Mérida than that of Campeche, for the export of products from the north of the Peninsula. All kinds of sailboats engaged in foreign trade and cabotage arrived at Sisal: national and foreign banks of more than 100 tons. In the second half of the 19th century, the first steam vessels began to arrive in Sisal, some of much larger tonnage than the big sailing ships. When taking boom, the export of henequen intensified the movement in the port turning Sisal into an important place in commercial navigation. The situation changed in 1844, when the maritime customs office operating in Sisal moved to Progreso, because it was closer to Mérida.

===Empress visit===
As the main port of entry to the Yucatán Peninsula, Sisal was a place of historical events: for example, during the Second Mexican Empire, the Empress Carlota de México disembarked during her visit to Yucatán. On 22 November 1865, at eleven and fifty in the morning, anchored in front of the port the national steam &quot;Tabasco&quot;, aboard which came the Empress with family and entourage.

In preparation for the visit, the imperial commissioner José Salazar Ilarregui inaugurated the Mérida-Sisal telegraph service on 12 November 1865. This is the first telegraphic line on the Yucatán peninsula, through which the imperial arrival of the Empress was announced.

It is one of the traces of the Empress towards Merida. Masonry columns along the Mérida-Sisal road (called Camino Real), in which the number of each league was engraved in relief. At present some leguaries are still standing. Another commemorative work was on the facade of the customs building, where a marble tombstone was inscribed with the inscription:
&quot;The employees of Hacienda de Sisal, to the pleasant memory of the happy arrival to the peninsula of its sovereign the Empress Carlota Amalia, on November 22, 1865&quot;.

==Demography==
According to the 2010 census conducted by INEGI, the population of the town was 1837 inhabitants, of whom 940 were men and 897 were women.

<doc id="729675" wikidata="Q28055" url="?curid=729675" title="Vultee BT-13 Valiant">
<text>The Vultee BT-13 Valiant is an American World War II-era basic (a category between primary and advanced) trainer aircraft built by Vultee Aircraft for the United States Army Air Corps, and later US Army Air Forces. A subsequent variant of the BT-13 in USAAC/USAAF service was known as the BT-15 Valiant, while an identical version for the US Navy was known as the SNV and was used to train naval aviators for the US Navy and its sister services, the US Marine Corps and US Coast Guard.

==Design and development==

According to Jonathan Thompson, &quot;The three trainer designs that shared their basic engineering with the Vanguard fighter were all promoted under the same name, Valiant. The prototypes had consectutive serial numbers 139, 140 and 141 and made their first flights in the Spring and Summer of 1939. While similar in appearance, they were distinct in purpose and performance, and only one of them succeeded in winning a production contract. This turned out to be six AC contracts with three supplements, eventually amounting to 11,526 aircraft, plus twelve ordered by Peru, for a total of 11,538.&quot;

On 24 March, the Vultee BC-51 advanced trainer first flew, but lost out in competition to the North American AT-6. The Air Corps did accept the Vultee BC-51 though, designating it as the BC-3 after some upgrades in the Spring of 1940. On 9 June, Vultee model 54 advanced trainer first flew. Its original 450-hp Wright Whirlwind was eventually replaced with a R-1340. On 28 July, the Vultee model 54A first flew. According to Thompson, &quot;A Basic Trainer, similar to the model 54 except for its fixed landing gear and P&amp;W R-985 engine, it struck pay dirt. In August the USAAC selected it for volume production as the BT-13. which became the standard type for the category throughout World War II.&quot;

The Vultee BT-13 was the basic trainer flown by most American pilots during World War II. It was the second phase of the three phase training program for pilots. After primary training in PT-13, PT-17, or PT-19 trainers, the student pilot moved to the more complex Vultee for continued flight training. The BT-13 had a more powerful engine and was faster and heavier than the primary trainer. It required the student pilot to use two way radio communications with the ground and to operate landing flaps and a two-position Hamilton Standard controllable-pitch propeller (or, more commonly, a constant-speed propeller).

The BT-13A dispensed with the landing gear fairings. Due to the demand for this aircraft, and others which used the same Pratt &amp; Whitney engine, some were equipped with Wright powerplants of similar size and power built in 1941–42. The Wright-equipped aircraft were designated BT-15. The BT-15B had a 24-volt electrical system.

The Navy adopted the P&amp;W powered aircraft as their main basic trainer, designating it the SNV. The BT-13 production run outnumbered all other Basic Trainer (BT) types produced.

According to Thompson, &quot;Because of Vultee&#x27;s outstanding production achievement, as well as the service&#x27;s accelerated training programs, the huge pilot requirements were met by mid-1943 and the last Valiants were built in mid-1944. Except for resonances in various flight modes that earned it the nickname &#x27;Vibrator,&#x27; the Valiant&#x27;s simplicity and effectiveness caused it to be taken for granted, and practically forgotten after all of them were sold at war&#x27;s end.&quot;

The BT-13 was not without its faults. Some had been built with plywood tailcones and empennages, which did not always remain firmly aligned with the aircraft.

Thompson states, &quot;Most of the 5137 Valiants sold in the United States by the War Assets Administration, Reconstruction Finance Corporation and other agencies went for $450, a mere $1/hp, to cropdusters who wanted only the R-985 and R-975 engines.&quot;

<doc id="729676" wikidata="Q7964129" url="?curid=729676" title="Walter A. O'Brien">
<text>Walter A. O&#x27;Brien, Jr. (December 19, 1914 – July 3, 1998) was a Progressive Party politician from Boston, Massachusetts, United States in the 1940s and the fourth child of Walter A. O’Brien from Portland and Susan Ann Crosby, both third generation Irish Americans.

In 1949, O&#x27;Brien ran for mayor of Boston. Lacking sufficient financial support to pay for radio advertising, O&#x27;Brien commissioned campaign songs from local folk artists promoting his themes, recorded them, then played them out of a loudspeaker on a truck driven through town. O&#x27;Brien was fined $10 for disturbing the peace as a result.

One of those songs, &quot;Charlie on the M.T.A.&quot;, has survived all memory of O&#x27;Brien himself, thanks largely to The Kingston Trio, who recorded and released the song (as &quot;M.T.A.&quot;) in 1959. The smart card for Boston transit is called a &quot;CharlieCard&quot;.

O&#x27;Brien finished last in the mayoral race. In the election of November 8, 1949, John B. Hynes received 137,930 votes, James M. Curley received 126,000, Patrick J. &quot;Sonny&quot; McDonough received 22,230, George F. Oakes received 7,171, and Walter A. O&#x27;Brien received 3,659 (1.2% of the total).

By the mid-1950s, the strong leftist policies of the Progressives combined with the Red Scare led to their public perception as communists (though they had no connection to the existing Communist Party). As a result, O&#x27;Brien disappeared into political obscurity along with his party. The Kingston Trio changed O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s name in their version of the song to avoid it being associated with his party.

In 1954, Herbert Philbrick testified before a hearing of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee that he knew Walter O&#x27;Brien to be a member of the Communist Party and had attended cell meetings with him.

After his political career ended, O&#x27;Brien retired to Harpswell in his home state of Maine, where he worked as a librarian and later ran an intermittently open used bookstore.

<text>Václav &quot;Vašek&quot; Klouda (born 1986) is a Czech competitive freestyle footbag player. Raised and resident in Prague, in the Czech Republic, Klouda started playing footbag when he was 13. He won his first Footbag World Championship in 2002 in San Francisco, beating the two-time defending champion Ryan Mulroney in the most tightly contested finals ever. He completed a clean sweep by taking first place in the three major freestyle disciplines: 2 Minute Routines, Shred30, and Sick 3. Klouda has since successfully defended his title five times, in Prague in 2003, Montreal in 2004, in Helsinki in 2005, in Frankfurt in 2006, and in Orlando in 2007. He holds the record for most consecutive World Titles (6), as well as total World Titles (7).

In the 2008 IFPA Footbag World Championships, held in Prague, Klouda was beaten by Damian Gielnicki of Poland, ending his bid for a 7th straight world championship.

Bouncing back from 2008, Klouda reclaimed the world title in Berlin, Germany. At the tournament Klouda&#x27;s first book was launched. The Vašek Klouda Manual: How to Play Footbag is an eBook downloadable from the Czech Footbag Association&#x27;s homepage.

In Klouda&#x27;s autobiography he mentions tennis, boxing and tae kwon do. He also talks about his time learning chess and says, &quot;I also had a chance to play against the then world champion Kasparov&quot;.

<doc id="729686" wikidata="Q3863186" url="?curid=729686" title="Morris Raphael Cohen">
<text>Morris Raphael Cohen (; July 25, 1880 – January 28, 1947) was an American judicial philosopher, lawyer, and legal scholar who united pragmatism with logical positivism and linguistic analysis. This union coalesced into the &quot;objective relativism&quot; fermenting at Columbia University before and during the early twentieth-century interwar period. He was father to Felix S. Cohen and Leonora Cohen Rosenfield.

==Life and career==

Cohen was born in Minsk, Imperial Russia (present-day Belarus), the son of Bessie (Farfel) and Abraham Mordecai Cohen. He moved with his family to New York, at the age of 12. He attended the City College of New York and Harvard University, where he studied under Josiah Royce, William James, and Hugo Münsterberg. He obtained a PhD from Harvard in 1906.

He was Professor of Philosophy at CCNY from 1912 to 1938. He also taught law at City College and the University of Chicago 1938-41, gave courses at the New School for Social Research, and lectured in Philosophy and Law at Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, and other universities.

Cohen was legendary as a professor for his wit, encyclopedic knowledge, and ability to demolish philosophical systems. &quot;He could and did tear things apart in the most devastating and entertaining way; but...he had a positive message of his own&quot;, said Robert Hutchins. Bertrand Russell said of Cohen that he had the most original mind in contemporary American philosophy.

In 1923 he edited and penned an introduction to a collection of Charles Sanders Peirce essays entitled &quot;Chance, Love and Logic&quot;.

In the 1930s, Cohen helped give CCNY its reputation as the &quot;proletarian Harvard,&quot; perhaps more than any other faculty member. He advocated liberalism in politics but opposed laissez-faire economics. Cohen also defended liberal democracy and wrote indictments of both fascism and communism. Cohen&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;New York Times&quot; called him &quot;an almost legendary figure in American philosophy, education and the liberal tradition&quot;.

From his work, &quot;Reason and Nature&quot;:
:To be sure, the vast majority of people who are untrained can accept the results of science only on authority. But there is obviously an important difference between an establishment that is open and invites every one to come, study its methods, and suggest improvement, and one that regards the questioning of credentials as due to wickedness of heart, such as Cardinal Newman attributed to those who questioned the infallibility of the Bible. . . . Rational science treats its credit notes as always redeemable on demand, while non-rational authoritarianism regards the demand for the redemption of its paper as a disloyal lack of faith.

On May 3, 1953, under President Buell G. Gallagher, the City College Library was dedicated to and named for Morris Raphael Cohen.

Cohen helped, with Professor Salo W. Baron, organize the &quot;Conference on Jewish Relations&quot; to study modern Jewry scientifically; he also edited its quarterly journal &quot;Jewish Social Studies&quot;.

Cohen died on January 28,1947 in Washington, D.C. 

According to Richard T. Hall, he was buried in Mount Zion Cemetery in Maspeth, New York.

<text>Fluticasone is a manufactured glucocorticoid used to treat nasal congestion. Both the esters, fluticasone propionate (sold as Flovent) and fluticasone furoate, are also used as topical anti-inflammatories and inhaled corticosteroids, and are used much more commonly in comparison.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 25th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 22million prescriptions, although it is also sold over-the-counter (OTC).

<doc id="729694" wikidata="Q584135" url="?curid=729694" title="Antitoxin">
<text>An antitoxin is an antibody with the ability to neutralize a specific toxin. Antitoxins are produced by certain animals, plants, and bacteria in response to toxin exposure. Although they are most effective in neutralizing toxins, they can also kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Antitoxins are made within organisms, and can be injected into other organisms, including humans, to treat an infectious disease. This procedure involves injecting an animal with a safe amount of a particular toxin. The animal&#x27;s body then makes the antitoxin needed to neutralize the toxin. Later, blood is withdrawn from the animal. When the antitoxin is obtained from the blood, it is purified and injected into a human or other animal, inducing temporary passive immunity. To prevent serum sickness, it is often best to use an antitoxin obtained from the same species (e.g. use human antitoxin to treat humans).

Most antitoxin preparations are prepared from donors with high titers of antibody against the toxin, making them hyperimmune globulins.

== History of antitoxin ==
Antitoxins to diphtheria and tetanus toxins were produced by Emil Adolf von Behring and his colleagues from 1890 onwards. The use of diphtheria antitoxin for the treatment of diphtheria was regarded by &quot;The Lancet&quot; as the &quot;most important advance of the [19th] Century in the medical treatment of acute infectious disease&quot;.

In 1888, Behring was sent to Berlin for a brief service at the Academy for Military Medicine. In 1889, he joined the Institute for Hygiene of the University of Berlin, then headed by Robert Koch. Between 1889 and 1895, Behring developed his pioneering ideas on serum therapy and his theory of antitoxins.

Early 1887, in Bonn, Behring had found that the serum of tetanus-immune white rats contained a substance that neutralized anthrax bacilli. He recognized this as the source of their &quot;resistance&quot;. On 4 December 1890, Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō published their first paper on blood-serum therapy. On 11 December, another report, signed by Behring, discussed blood-serum therapy not only in the treatment of tetanus, but also in diphtheria.

When Paul Ehrlich demonstrated in 1891 that even vegetable poisons led to the formation of antitoxins in an organism, Behring&#x27;s theory was confirmed.

Antitoxins are antibody proteins found within the serum of animals that have been injected with the toxin. Separating unnecessary proteins from the antibodies used to counter infections in medical practice is important to increase both potency of antitoxin doses and to reduced the incidence of serum sickness. Annie Homer, working in Canada during the First World War, undertook research into antitoxic sera, which resulted in innovative methods to manufacture high quality antitoxin protein fractions from serum.

An antitoxin for scarlet fever was developed in 1924, simultaneously by Raymond Dochez and Gladys and George Frederick Dick.

<text>A panacea () is any supposed that is claimed (for example) to cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely. Named after the Greek goddess of universal remedy Panacea, it was in the past sought by alchemists in connection with the elixir of life and the philosopher&#x27;s stone, a mythical substance that would enable the transmutation of common metals into gold.
Through the 18th and 19th centuries, many &quot;patent medicines&quot; were claimed to be panaceas, and they became very big business.
The term &quot;panacea&quot; is used in a negative way to describe the overuse of any one solution to solve many different problems, especially in medicine. The word has acquired connotations of snake oil and quackery.

A panacea (or &quot;panaceum&quot;) is also a literary term to represent any solution to solve all problems related to a particular issue.

==Mythology==

In Greek mythology, Panacea was one of the daughters of the Greek god of medicine Asclepius, along with her four sisters, each of whom performed one aspect of health care:
* Panacea (the goddess of the cure)
* Hygieia (&quot;Hygiene&quot;, the goddess of cleanliness, and sanitation)
* Iaso (the goddess of recuperation from illness)
* Aceso (the goddess of the healing process)
* Aglæa/Ægle (the goddess of beauty and splendor)

According to the mythology, Panacea had an elixir or potion with which she was able to heal any human malady, and her name has become interchangeable with the name of the cure itself.

== History ==
=== Ancient medicine ===
Ancient Greek and Roman scholars described various kinds of plants that were called &quot;panacea&quot; or &quot;panaces&quot;, such as &quot;Opopanax&quot; sp., &quot;Centaurea&quot; sp., &quot;Levisticum officinale&quot;, &quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; and &quot;Echinophora tenuifolia&quot;.

The Cahuilla people of the Colorado Desert region of California used the red sap of the elephant tree (&quot;Bursera microphylla&quot;) as a panacea.

The Latin genus name of ginseng is &quot;Panax&quot;, (or &quot;panacea&quot;) reflecting Linnean understanding that traditional Chinese medicine used ginseng widely as a cure-all.

In 1581 the Dutch doctor Giles Everard (also known as Gilles Everaerts) published &quot;On the Panacea Herb [De herba panacea]&quot;, a book that implied that tobacco, then growing in popularity after its recent introduction to Europe, was the long-lost ancient panacea. A work attributed to him appeared in English in 1659, entitled &quot;Panacea; Or The Universal Medicine: Being a Discovery of the Wonderfull Vertues of Tobacco Taken in a Pipe, with Its Operation and Use Both in Physick and Chyrurgery.&quot;

=== The rise of &quot;patent medicines&quot; ===

The cure-alls became known as &quot;patent medicines&quot; that grew starting in the late 17th century with increasing marketing. Some found favour with royalty and were issued &quot;letters patent&quot; authorising the use of the royal endorsement in advertising.
Eighteenth century England has been popularly referred to as the &quot;golden age of physic&quot;, due to the widespread availability and consumption of enormous amounts of proprietary medicines - many of which were principally laxatives but with the added claim that they somehow purified the blood and so cured all manner of illness.
The first such preparation that is known to use the term &quot;panacea&quot; for promotion was Panacea of William Swaim, starting in 1820. Defending the use of that term later, he stated that it was often used &quot;in the restricted sense of a remedy for a large class of diseases, and not in its literal and more comprehensive meaning.&quot; He started publishing pamphlets to promote it in 1822, and in 1824 he published a book with the title &quot;A Treatise on Swaim&#x27;s Panacea; Being a Recent Discovery for the Cure of Scrofula or King&#x27;s Evil, Mercurial Disease, Deep-Seated Syphilis, Rheumatism, and All Disorders Arising from a Contaminated or Impure State of the Blood&quot;. The Philadelphia Medical Society took particular exception, forming a committee to tackle quack medicines which reported that The Panacea was neither effective nor safe.

Touting these nostrums with implausible claims was one of the first major projects of the advertising industry. An early pioneer in the use of advertising to promote patent medicine was New York businessman Benjamin Brandreth, whose &quot;Vegetable Universal Pill&quot; eventually became one of the best-selling patent medicines in the United States. For fifty years Brandreth&#x27;s name was a household word in the United States; the Brandreth pills were a purgative that allegedly cured many ills by purging toxins out of the blood, which he claimed was the cause of all maladies. In the absence of proof, Brandreth justified this claim by quoting scripture : &quot;The life of the flesh is in the blood.&quot; An advertisement from 1865 claimed that &quot;By their use acute disease of every kind is cured. Perseverance will cure most chronic cases.&quot; They became so well known they received mention in Herman Melville&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

Similarly, James Morison was a British quack-physician who sold &quot;Hygeian Vegetable Universal Medicine&quot;, which were advertised as &quot;A cure for all curable ills&quot;. Morrison established his own medical school, The British College of Health, which trained agents known as Hygeists to sell the pills. However, satirists were brutal in their attacks on the business and its gullible clients, with caricatures even showing people re-growing severed limbs.

Many other patent medicines made claims to cure implausibly wide-ranging conditions.
An early nineteenth century advertisement for Daffy&#x27;s Elixir said it was used for the following ailments: The Stone in Babies and Children; Convulsion fits; Consumption and Bad Digestives; Agues; Piles; Surfeits; Fits of the Mother and Vapours from the Spleen; Green Sickness; Children&#x27;s Distempers, whether the Worms, Rickets, Stones, Convulsions, Gripes, King&#x27;s Evil, Joint Evil or any other disorder proceeding from Wind or Crudities; Gout and Rheumatism; Stone or Gravel in the Kidnies; Cholic and Griping of the Bowels; the Phthisic; Dropsy and Scurvy.
In 1891, Dr. John Collis Browne&#x27;s Chlorodyne was advertised as a treatment for coughs, consumption, bronchitis, asthma, diphtheria, fever, croup, ague, diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, epilepsy, hysteria, palpatation, spasms, neuralgia, rheumatism, gout, cancer, toothache, meningitis, etc.
Even Coca-Cola was marketed as a patent medicine in its early days: it was claimed to cure many diseases, including morphine addiction, indigestion, nerve disorders, headaches, and impotence.

The conventional medical profession pushed back against the claims of panaceas. In 1828, the New York state medical society adopted one of America&#x27;s first medical ethics codes, which stated that patent medicines were not to be tolerated. From about the 1830s, one of the principal targets was Morison&#x27;s &quot;Hygeian Vegetable Universal Medicine&quot;. Morison retaliated by appealing to what is now known as the logical fallacy of the &quot;appeal to nature&quot;, criticizing the medical reliance on chemicals in contrast to his remedies made from natural vegetables.
In contrast to their advertised safety, Morison&#x27;s pills could be dangerous, and fatal if taken in large enough quantities. In 1836, John MacKenzie, aged 32, who was diagnosed with rheumatism in the knee, died after one of Morison&#x27;s agents gave him 1,000 pills over 20 days; that agent was indicted and found guilty of manslaughter. The following year, excessive consumption of Morison&#x27;s pills was found to cause 12 deaths following investigations in York. Morison himself evaded punishment as the charges were against his agents. After Morrison died in 1840 and his sons took over, they expanded the product range. The pills were finally withdrawn from sale in the 1920s.

The founding of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1841 marked another step away from patent medicines and panaceas.

==Claims and restrictions==
Legislation covering claims of cure-all preparations varies by jurisdiction.
===Australia===
In Australia, the criteria for the registration of drugs and other therapeutic goods in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, which includes guidelines on advertising, labelling, and product design, are outlined in the Therapeutic Goods Act, Regulations, and Orders. Other aspects, like the scheduling of substances and secure storage of therapeutic goods, are subject to State or Territory laws.
===United States===
In 1906, the United States passed of the first Pure Food and Drug Act. This statute did not ban the alcohol, narcotics, and stimulants in the medicines; it required them to be labelled as such, and curbed some of the more misleading, overstated, or fraudulent claims that appeared on the labels. In 1936 the statute was revised to ban them, and the United States entered a long period of ever more drastic reductions in the medications available unmediated by physicians and prescriptions. Morris Fishbein, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, who was active in the first half of the 20th century, based much of his career on exposing quacks and driving them out of business.

In the United States, there have been cases of products that claimed to cure many, many diseases. Seasilver, a commercial dietary supplement that was sold via multi-level marketing plan, was promoted with the false claim that it could &quot;cure 650 diseases&quot;, resulting in the prosecution and fining of the owners.

<doc id="729697" wikidata="Q8027117" url="?curid=729697" title="Wisconsin Badgers Crew">
<text>The Wisconsin Badgers Crew is the rowing team that represents the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Rowing at the University dates back to 1874. 
The women&#x27;s openweight team is an NCAA Division I team. The men&#x27;s and lightweight women&#x27;s programs compete at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) Championship Regatta because the NCAA does not sanction a men&#x27;s or lightweight women&#x27;s national championship. Chris Clark has been the men&#x27;s head coach since 1996 and Bebe Bryans was the women&#x27;s head coach from 2004-2023.

==History==
The first crew is believed to have set out on Lake Mendota in 1874, though the only evidence of this is a letter written in 1912 by a Wisconsin alumnus. By 1878 rowing had become an intramural sport at the university. Affectionately nicknamed &quot;the Naval Department&quot;, the crew had a boathouse and first represented the University of Wisconsin competitively by 1893 and secured its first coach in 1894. In addition to gymnasium conditioning, early rowers used the Yahara River for training. Having no collegiate competitors in the Midwest, the crew started attending regattas in the East starting in 1896, but were denied entry to the Intercollegiate Rowing Association. The Wisconsin freshmen eight won their event&#x27;s national championship in 1900, the first national championship win for the rowing team. Since then, the Wisconsin crew has won 48 Intercollegiate Rowing Association titles.

The men&#x27;s varsity eight won its first IRA national championship in 1951, the first of nine such titles. The 1990 win brought an invitation to the Henley Royal Regatta, the fourth visit for Wisconsin. The Wisconsin varsity eight has placed in the top three spots at the IRA National Championship Regatta 20 times since 1950, an achievement only surpassed by the University of Washington. In 2008, the Badgers&#x27; varsity eight won the IRA national championship over second-place Washington by 1.72 seconds, capping off an undefeated season.

Wisconsin&#x27;s women first began actively competing the Winter/Spring of 1972 as a club sport. After a winter of conditioning, they unofficially beat the national record, in their very first race. Fall of that year, they headed to Boston, for The Head of the Charles Regatta, where they took 2nd place. At that time, the National Women’s Rowing Association championship served as the national championship for collegiate boats. The women&#x27;s varsity eight won the club title in 1975, and was the highest placed collegiate boat in 1976, 1977, and 1978. In 1986, the Wisconsin women won the National Collegiate Championship, which first began in 1981. In 2009 the varsity four were runners-up at the D-1 NCAA championships. This was the highest-ever finish for a Wisconsin boat in the history of the NCAA championships.

During the 2010 season, the openweight women won the school&#x27;s first Big Ten Conference rowing championship, held in Laingsburg, Michigan. The team won four of the six events (1st and 2nd novice 8, varsity 4, and second varsity 8) and finished 2nd in the varsity 8 and 3rd in second varsity four.

==Location==
Wisconsin&#x27;s three-story boathouse is located on the southern shore of Lake Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin. The Porter Boathouse spans and was completed in the spring of 2005. It includes a moving water rowing tank for 24 athletes, five boat bays (including one repair bay) with storage for 100 rowing shells, coaches&#x27; offices, and locker rooms for each team. The Porter Boathouse was named in recognition of a donation by the Ben and Cheslee Porter Family for over $1 million toward the facility.

The team&#x27;s first boathouse, located in front of the Red Gym, stood from 1893 through 1968. The 1967 boathouse, completed in 1967, was located at the site of the current (Porter) boathouse. The 1967 boathouse housed the team&#x27;s activities until 2003, when construction on the Porter Boathouse began.

<text>The fulvous whistling duck or fulvous tree duck (Dendrocygna bicolor) is a species of whistling duck that breeds across the world&#x27;s tropical regions in much of Mexico and South America, the West Indies, the southern United States, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It has plumage that is mainly reddish brown, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on the ground. Its preferred habitat consists of wetlands with plentiful vegetation, including shallow lakes and paddy fields.
The nest, built from plant material and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or in a tree hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest within a day or so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later.

The fulvous whistling duck feeds in wetlands by day or night on seeds and other parts of plants. It is sometimes regarded as a pest of rice cultivation, and is also shot for food in parts of its range. Despite hunting, poisoning by pesticides and natural predation by mammals, birds, and reptiles, the large numbers and huge range of this duck mean that it is classified as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

==Taxonomy==
The whistling ducks, &quot;Dendrocygna&quot;, are a distinctive group of eight bird species within the duck, goose and swan family, Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a superspecies with the wandering whistling duck. It has no recognised subspecies, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US have in the past been assigned to &quot;D. b. helva&quot;, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than &quot;D. b. bicolor&quot;.

The duck was first described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 and given the name &quot;Anas fulva&quot; but the name was &quot;preoccupied&quot;, or already used, by Friedrich Christian Meuschen in 1787 for another species. This led to the next available name proposed by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816 from a Paraguayan specimen as &quot;Anas bicolor&quot;. The whistling ducks were moved to their current genus, &quot;Dendrocygna&quot;, by British ornithologist William Swainson in recognition of their differences from other ducks. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;dendron&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, and Latin &quot;cygnus&quot;, &quot;swan&quot;, and &quot; bicolor&quot; is Latin for &quot;two-coloured&quot;. &quot;Fulvous&quot; means reddish-yellow, and is derived from the Latin equivalent &quot;fulvus&quot;. Old and regional names include large whistling teal, brown tree duck, Mexican duck, pichiguila, squealer and Spanish cavalier.

==Description==
The fulvous whistling duck is long; the male weighs , and the female averages marginally lighter at . The wingspan ranges from 85 to 93 cm.

It is a long-legged duck, mainly different shades of brown; head, neck and breast are particularly rich buff (fulvous) with a darker back. The mantle is more darker shade of brown with buff-tipped feathers, the flight feathers and tail are dark brown, and a dark brown to black stripe runs through the center of the crown down the back of the neck to the base of the mantle. It has whitish stripes on its flanks, a long grey bill and grey legs. In flight, the wings are brown above and black below, with no white markings, and a white crescent on the rump contrasts with the black tail. All plumages are fairly similar, but the female is slightly smaller and duller-plumaged than the male. The juvenile has paler underparts, and appears generally duller, especially on the flanks. There is a complete wing moult after breeding, and birds then seek the cover of dense wetland vegetation while they are flightless. Body feathers may be moulted throughout the year; each feather is replaced only once annually.

These are noisy birds with a clear whistling &quot;kee-wee-ooo&quot; call given on the ground or in flight, frequently heard at night. Quarrelling birds also have a harsh repeated &quot;kee&quot;. In flight, the beating wings produce a dull sound. The calls of males and females show differences in structure and an acoustic analysis on 59 captive birds demonstrated 100% accuracy in sexing when compared with molecular methods.
Adult birds in Asia can be confused with the similar lesser whistling duck, which is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the back of the neck. Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.
==Distribution and habitat==

The fulvous whistling duck has a very large range extending across four continents. It breeds in lowland South America from northern Argentina to Colombia and then up to the southern US and the West Indies. It is found in a broad belt across sub-Saharan Africa and down the east of the continent to South Africa and Madagascar. The Indian subcontinent is the Asian stronghold. It undertakes seasonal movements in response to the availability of water and food. African birds move southwards in the southern summer to breed and return north in the winter, and Asian populations are highly nomadic due to the variability of rainfall. This species has strong colonising tendencies, having expanded its range in Mexico, the US and the West Indies in recent decades with northerly range expansions into California in late 19th century and rice-growing regions of the U.S. Gulf Coastal Plain in the early to mid-20th century, given its affinity for rice-growing areas. Breeding in the northern American region is restricted to the Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas and Louisiana and localities in southern California and south- and east-central Florida. Observations of the bird outside the nesting season, especially since the 1950s have been recorded in temperate regions as far north as the Mississippi River Basin, eastern Great Lakes region, and along the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts right up to southern Canada. Wandering birds can turn up far beyond the normal range, sometimes staying to nest, as in Morocco, Peru and Hawaii.

The fulvous whistling duck is found in lowland marshes and swamps in open, rice fields, flat country, and it avoids wooded areas. It is not normally a mountain species, breeding in Venezuela, for example, only up , but the single Peruvian breeding record was at .

==Behaviour==

This species is usually found in small groups, but substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without waddling, and normally feeds by upending, though it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds during the day and at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups in the middle of the day. They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.

Several arthropod parasites have been recorded on this duck, including chewing mites of the families Philopteridae and Menoponidae, feather mites and skin mites. Internal helminth parasites include roundworms, tapeworms and flukes. In a survey in Florida, all 30 ducks tested carried at least two helminth species; none had blood parasites. Only one duck had no mites or lice.

===Breeding===
Breeding coincides with the availability of water. In South America and South Africa, the main nesting period is December–February, in Nigeria it is July–December, and in North America mid-May–August. In India, the breeding season is from June to October but peaking in July and August. Fulvous whistling ducks show lifelong monogamy; the courtship display is limited to some mutual head-dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which the birds raise their bodies side by side while treading water.

Pairs may breed alone or in loose groups. In South Africa, nests may be within of each other, and breeding densities of up to 13.7 nests per square kilometre (35.5 per square mile) have been found in Louisiana. The nest, across, is made from plant leaves and stems and has little or no soft lining. It is usually built on the ground (unlike the Black-bellied whistling duck), in marsh vegetation, and in artificial habitats such as shallowly-flooded rice fields, in dense vegetation and close to water, but sometimes in tree holes. In India, the use of tree holes, and even the old nests of raptors or crows, is much more common than elsewhere. Eggs are laid at roughly 24- to 36-hour intervals, starting before the nest is complete, resulting in some losses from the clutch. They are whitish and on average measure and weigh . The clutch is usually around ten eggs, but other females sometimes lay into the nest, so 20 or more may be found on occasion. Eggs may also be added to the nests of other species, like ruddy duck.

Both sexes incubate, changing over once a day, with the male often taking the greater share of this duty. The eggs hatch in about 24–29 days, The downy ducklings are grey, with paler upperparts, and a white band on the neck, and weigh within a day of hatching. Like all ducklings, they are precocial and leave the nest after a day or so, but the parents protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later. Eggs and duckling may be preyed on by mammals, birds and reptiles; one parent may try to distract a potential predator with a broken-wing display while the other adult leads the ducklings away. Birds are sexually mature after one year, and the maximum known age is 6.5 years.

In South Africa, a few records of hybridization with the white-faced whistling duck have been noted in the wild; in most parts of southern Africa, the two species breed at different times, &quot;bicolor&quot; during the dry season (April to September) and &quot;viduata&quot; during the rains (October to March). Hybridization in captivity is more frequent but limited to other species in the genus &quot;Dendrocygna&quot;.

==Feeding==

The fulvous whistling duck feeds in wetlands by day or night, often in mixed flocks with relatives such as white-faced or black-bellied whistling ducks. Its food is generally plant material, including seeds, bulbs, grasses and stems, but females may include animal items such as aquatic worms, molluscs and insects as they prepare for egg-laying, which may then comprise up to 4% of their diet. Ducklings may also eat a few insects. Foraging is by picking plant items while walking or swimming, by upending, or occasionally by diving to a depth of up to . Favoured plants include water snowflake, aquatic ragweeds, bourgou millet, shama grass, Cape blue water lily, waxy-leaf nightshade, beakrush, flatsedge and polygonums. Rice is normally a small part of the diet, and a survey in Cuban rice fields found that the plants taken were mainly weeds growing with the crop. However, in a study in Louisiana, 25% of the diet of incubating females consisted of cereal.

==Status==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates the population of the fulvous whistling duck to be from 1.3 to 1.5 million individuals around the world. This may be an underestimate since regional assessments suggest 1 million birds in the Americas, 1.1 million in Africa and at least 20,000 in South Asia for a grand total of 2.12 million ducks around the world. The population appears to be declining, but the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria for extinction. The large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this duck is classified by the IUCN as being of Least Concern. It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

The fulvous whistling duck has expanded its range in the West Indies, and into the southern US. A series of invasions from South America and reaching the eastern US commenced around 1948, fueled by rice cultivation, and breeding was recorded in Cuba in 1964, and Florida in 1965. Some Florida birds still winter in Cuba. In Africa, it bred on the Cape Peninsula between 1940 and the 1960s. A survey of eighteen species which had colonised the area in recent decades found that most were wetland species that had used irrigated farmland as &quot;stepping stones&quot; across the arid country separating the peninsula from the breeding main range. However, the status of the two whistling duck species featured in the research is dubious since they are popular ornamental species, so their origin is unclear.

Outside North America it is subject to hunting for food or because of its liking for rice, and persecution means that it is now rare in Madagascar. Pesticides used on rice fields may also have an adverse impact, causing liver and breast muscle damage even at sub-lethal levels.

<doc id="729713" wikidata="Q875262" url="?curid=729713" title="Citrus unshiu">
<text>Citrus unshiu is a semi-seedless and easy-peeling citrus species, also known as the satsuma mandarin or Japanese mandarin. During the Edo period of Japan, kishu mikans were more popular because there was a popular superstition that eating &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; without seeds made people prone to infertility. &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; became popular in Japan after modernization started in the Meiji period. It was introduced to the West from the Satsuma region of Japan in 1878. 

&quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; was named after Unshu (Wenzhou), a famous production area of &quot;Citrus&quot; species in China, in the late Edo period of Japan. Before the name &quot;unshu mikan&quot; was established in Japan, it was called &quot;nakajima mikain&quot; or &quot;nagashima mikan&quot; after the place name of Nishi-Nakajima in Amakusa District of the Higo Province (later Nagashima, Kagoshima), where the species is said to have been born.

There are two theories about the origin of the &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot;. One is that &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; originated in Japan, while the other is that it originated in China. According to the Japanese origin theory, several species that would serve as the parents of &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; were introduced from China, and in the 1600s, they were born in Nishi-Nakajima, Higo Province (later Nagashima, Kagoshima) in Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Ehime Prefecture and Japanese scientists support this theory of Japanese origin.

Genetic studies conducted in the 2010s suggest that the maternal species of &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; is kishu (&quot;Citrus kinokuni&quot;) and the paternal species is kunenbo (&quot;Citrus nobilis&quot; Lour. var. &quot;kunip&quot;). 

Various cultivars have been developed based on the &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot;, and in Japan, three cultivars, namely miyagawa wase, okitsu wase, and aoshima unshu, account for nearly half of the production volume of &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot;.

== Nomenclature ==
The unshiu is known as () in China, and in Japan (or formally , the Japanese reading of the characters used in Chinese). In both languages, the name means &quot;honey citrus of Wenzhou&quot; (a city in Zhejiang province, China). An alternative Chinese name, (), means &quot;seedless mandarin&quot;.

One of the English names for the fruit, &quot;satsuma&quot;, is derived from the former Satsuma Province in Japan, from which these fruits were first exported to the West.

The Afrikaans name is also used in South African English. It came originally from the Tamil word , meaning citrus.

== Classification ==
Under the Tanaka classification system, &quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; is considered a separate species from the mandarin. Under the Swingle system, unshius are considered to be a group of mandarin varieties. Genetic analysis has shown the Satsuma to be a highly inbred mandarin-pomelo hybrid, with 22% of its genome, a larger proportion than seen in most mandarins, coming from pomelo. It arose when a mandarin of the low-pomelo Huanglingmiao or kishumikan variety (placed in &quot;C. reticulata&quot; by Tanaka) was crossed with a pomelo or pomelo hybrid, then the resulting cultivar was backcrossed with another Huanglingmiao or kishumikan mandarin.

== Characteristics ==


&quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; is one of the sweetest citrus varieties. It is usually seedless, and is about the size of other mandarin oranges (&quot;Citrus reticulata&quot;). Satsumas are known for their loose, leathery skin; the fruit is very easily peeled in comparison to other citrus fruits. The rind is often smooth to slightly rough with the shape of a medium to small flattened sphere. Satsumas usually have 10 to 12 easily separable segments with tough membranes. The flesh is particularly delicate, and cannot withstand the effects of careless handling. Coloring of the fruit is often dependent on climate; satsumas grown in humid areas may be ripe while the skin is still green while those grown in areas with cool night temperatures may see a brilliant reddish orange skin at peak.

Satsumas are cold-hardy, and when planted in colder locations, the fruit becomes sweeter from the colder temperatures. A mature satsuma tree can survive down to or even for a few hours. Of the edible citrus varieties, only the kumquat is more cold-hardy. Satsumas rarely have any thorns, an attribute that also makes them popular. They can be grown from seed, which takes about eight years until the first fruits are produced, or grafted onto other citrus rootstocks, such as trifoliate orange.

== History ==
=== United States of America ===
Jesuits brought the fruit from Asia to North America in the 18th century, starting groves in the Jesuit Plantation upriver from New Orleans, Louisiana (then a part of New Spain). The municipal street &quot;Orange&quot; in New Orleans, was originally named &quot;Rue Des Orangers&quot; and the site of the Jesuit grove. The groves were later re-cultivated farther south in Plaquemines Parish to provide greater protection from harmful frosts, and have continued to the present day. The Becnel family are the largest growers of Louisiana citrus.

The fruit became much more common in the United States starting in the late 19th century. In 1878 during the Meiji period, Owari mikans were brought to the United States from the Satsuma Province in Kyūshū, Japan, by Anna Van Valkenburgh, the spouse of the US Minister to Japan, General Van Valkenburgh, who renamed them satsumas. Between 1908 and 1911 about a million Owari mikan trees were imported throughout the lower Gulf Coast states. Owari is still commonly grown in Florida. The towns of Satsuma, Alabama, Satsuma, Florida, Satsuma, Texas, and Satsuma, Louisiana were named after this fruit. By 1920 Jackson County in the Florida Panhandle had billed itself as the &quot;Satsuma Capital of the World&quot;. However, the commercial industry was damaged by a cold snap in 1911, a hurricane in 1915, and a very cold period in the late 1930s.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Citrus unshiu&quot; is amongst others grown in Japan, Spain, central China, Korea, the US, South Africa, South America, New Zealand, and around the Black Sea.

== Varieties ==
&quot;Unshiu&quot; varieties cluster among the mandarin family. There are, however, some hybrids.

=== Possible non-hybrids===
* Kishu mikan
* Ōgonkan or Ki-mikan
* Komikan

=== Hybrids ===
* Amanatsu (pomelo hybrid)
* Kinkoji unshiu (&quot;C. obovoidea&quot;(kinkoji) × &quot;C. unshiu&quot;)
* Kiyomi
** Dekopon is a kiyomi hybrid
* Kobayashi mikan (&quot;C. natsudaidai&quot; × &quot;C.unshiu&quot;)
* Shonan Gold
* Iyokan

<text>The Cochrane Cup has been competed for since 1961 by the Men&#x27;s Varsity Eight rowing teams of Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Wisconsin.

The cup was placed in competition by Mrs. Edward Cochrane in 1961 for heavyweight races among Dartmouth, MIT and Wisconsin. The cup is named after Admiral Edward L. Cochrane, former president of M.I.T., and director of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships. After one race of one mile (1961), one of 1.75 miles (1962) and another of two miles (1963), the cup has been raced on a 2000-meter course ever since.

The cup is named after Adm. Edward L. Cochrane of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships who is a former president of MIT.

<text>The Jim Ten Eyck Memorial Trophy is presented annually by the Syracuse Regatta Association to the rowing team with the highest points score at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association regatta.

It is named after James A. Ten Eyck who was the coach of the Syracuse University crew from 1903 to 1937. The University of Washington has won the overall points champion trophy from 2007 through 2015, an unprecedented nine consecutive years, and more than any other program.

From 1952 through 1973, the winning team was the one with the most points in the varsity, junior varsity and freshman eights. Starting in 1974, all races counted in the scoring under a system adopted by the coaches of the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges. More recently, the scoring system was revised to include only three of the four possible eights from each school in the points standings.

The points system is based on the number of regatta entrants. For example, with 18 entrants, the points system is as follows:

<doc id="729737" wikidata="Q7333527" url="?curid=729737" title="Right Ho, Jeeves">
<text>Right Ho, Jeeves is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, the second full-length novel featuring the popular characters Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, after &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;. It was first published in the United Kingdom on 5 October 1934 by Herbert Jenkins, London, and in the United States on 15 October 1934 by Little, Brown and Company, Boston, under the title Brinkley Manor. It had also been sold to the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, in which it appeared in serial form from 23 December 1933 to 27 January 1934, and in England in the &quot;Grand Magazine&quot; from April to September 1934. Wodehouse had already started planning this sequel while working on &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;.

The story is mostly set at Brinkley Court, the home of Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia, and introduces the recurring characters Gussie Fink-Nottle and Madeline Bassett. Bertie&#x27;s friend Tuppy Glossop and cousin Angela Travers also feature in the novel, as does Brinkley Court&#x27;s prized chef, Anatole.

==Plot==
Bertie returns to London from several weeks in Cannes spent in the company of his Aunt Dahlia Travers, her daughter Angela and her soppy, childish friend Madeline Bassett. In Bertie&#x27;s absence, Jeeves has been advising Bertie&#x27;s old school friend, Gussie Fink-Nottle, a shy teetotaller with a passion for newts and a face like a fish, who is in love with Madeline but is too timid to propose. Jeeves advises Gussie attend a fancy-dress ball (at Madeline’s invitation) dressed as Mephistopheles which Jeeves believes will give Gussie the confidence to confess his love. This plan fails, because of Gussie&#x27;s excessive goofiness. Owing to a strong disagreement about Bertie’s new mess jacket, Bertie harshly blames Jeeves for Gussie’s failure and tells him not to offer any more advice to him.

Gussie, though initially disturbed to hear Jeeves is no longer advising him, cheers up when Bertie tells him that Brinkley Court, where Madeline is staying, is also the country seat of Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom, and that he (Bertie) can easily get him (Gussie) an invitation to join her there. It happens that Aunt Dahlia had demanded that Bertie come to Brinkley Court to make a speech and present the school prizes to students at the local grammar school. Determined to avoid this task and to assist Gussie&#x27;s wooing, Bertie sends Gussie to Brinkley Court in his place where he will have the chance to get close to Madeline, and also be forced to distribute the school prizes instead of himself. Aunt Dahlia begrudgingly agrees to this. 

When Bertie hears that Angela has broken off her engagement to Tuppy Glossop, he feels obliged to go down to Brinkley Court himself, to comfort Aunt Dahlia. In addition to her worrying about Angela&#x27;s broken engagement, Aunt Dahlia is anxious because she has lost £500 gambling at Cannes, and now needs to ask her miserly husband Tom to replace the money in order to keep financing her magazine, &quot;Milady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;. Bertie takes umbrage when Aunt Dahlia says the only reason she’s grateful Bertie came is because he brought Jeeves. When Bertie tries to offer her advice she vigorously refuses to let him speak. Bertie finds Tuppy in the grounds who tells him he and Angela fell out due to Angela saying he was getting fat and Tuppy not believing she was attacked by a shark in Cannes. Bertie advises Tuppy to regain Angela&#x27;s sympathy by refusing his dinner. He offers similar advice to Gussie, to show his love for Madeline and to Aunt Dahlia to arouse Uncle Tom’s sympathy. All take his advice; however, neither Angela, nor Madeline nor Tom notice, and the resulting return of plates of untasted food severely upsets Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s temperamental prized French chef Anatole, who gives notice to quit. Aunt Dahlia understandably blames Bertie for this disaster.

Gussie still cannot confess his love to Madeline, so Bertie invites her for a walk to soften her up for him. Unfortunately she misinterprets his words as a marriage proposal on his own behalf. To his relief, she tells Bertie she cannot marry him, as she has fallen in love with Gussie. Bertie relays the good news to Gussie, but even with this encouragement, Gussie remains too timid to propose. Bertie decides to embolden him by lacing his orange juice with brandy.

Gussie ends up imbibing many times more brandy than Bertie had intended. Under its influence, Gussie successfully proposes to Madeline. He then presents the prizes to the schoolboys, with a drunken speech, berating the staff and pupils. Madeline, disgusted, breaks the engagement. Heartbroken and still drunk, Gussie proposes to Angela in order to score off Madeline; Angela accepts his proposal in order to score off Tuppy. Tuppy&#x27;s jealousy is aroused and he chases Gussie all around the mansion, vowing to beat him within an inch of his life. Madeline tells Bertie she will marry him instead of Gussie. The prospect of spending his life with the drippy Madeline appalls Bertie, but his personal code of chivalry will not allow him to insult her by withdrawing his &quot;proposal&quot; and turning her down.

Helpless in the face of all this chaos, Bertie appeals to Jeeves for advice. Jeeves suggests that Bertie ring the fire bell at midnight so Gussie and Tuppy will respectively rescue Madeline and Angela. Although skeptical, Bertie follows this advice. However, when all the residents have evacuated the building, none of the estranged couples appear reconciled. When they try to return to bed, they find that all the doors are locked; no one has the keys, and all staff members away at a dance. Naturally, Bertie is blamed for the group being forced to spend the rest of the night outside. Jeeves suggests that Bertie ride a bicycle to the staff dance to retrieve the key from the butler. Bertie initially refuses but is forced by Aunt Dahlia. Bertie cycles the nine miles to the dance only to be told by the butler that he left the keys with Jeeves. Furious at having taken a long, dangerous ride in the dark, Bertie returns to Brinkley Court, and finds that Madeline and Gussie have made up, Angela and Tuppy have also made up, Anatole has withdrawn his notice and agreed to stay on, and Uncle Tom has agreed to lend Aunt Dahlia the £500 she needs. Jeeves explains that his true plan was to unite all the estranged parties in their contempt for Bertie by forcing them so spend the night outside and then in their collective amusement by finding the keys just after Bertie left, thus making his journey pointless. Though tired and aching, Bertie cannot argue with the results. Jeeves then says that he accidentally burned Bertie&#x27;s mess jacket. Bertie is incensed, but agrees to let Jeeves have his way.

==Style==

Like the preceding novel &quot;Thank You, Jeeves&quot;, &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; uses Bertie&#x27;s rebellion against Jeeves to create strong plot conflict that is sustained through most of the story. Writer Kristin Thompson refers to these two novels as Bertie&#x27;s &quot;rebellious period&quot;, which ends when Jeeves reasserts his authority at the end of &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;. This period serves as a transition between the sustained action of the short stories and the later Jeeves novels, which generally use a more episodic problem-solution structure.

While Edwardian elements persist in Wodehouse&#x27;s stories, for instance the popularity of gentlemen&#x27;s clubs like the Drones Club, there are nevertheless references to contemporary events, as with a floating timeline. For example, in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, chapter 17, Bertie makes a contemporary reference to nuclear fission experiments:

I was reading in the paper the other day about those birds who are trying to split the atom, the nub being that they haven&#x27;t the foggiest as to what will happen if they do. It may be all right. On the other hand, it may not be all right. And pretty silly a chap would feel, no doubt, if having split the atom he suddenly found the house going up in smoke and himself being torn limb from limb.

When stirred, Bertie Wooster sometimes unintentionally employs spoonerisms, as he does in chapter 12: &quot;Tup, Tushy!—I mean, Tush, Tuppy!&quot;. Bertie occasionally uses a transferred epithet, using an adjective to modify a noun rather than using the corresponding adverb to modify the verb of the sentence, as in the following quote in chapter 17: &quot;It was the hottest day of the summer, and though somebody had opened a tentative window or two, the atmosphere remained distinctive and individual&quot;.

Wodehouse often uses popular detective story clichés out of place for humorous effect, as in chapter 15: &quot;Presently from behind us there sounded in the night the splintering crash of a well-kicked plate of sandwiches, accompanied by the muffled oaths of a strong man in his wrath&quot;.

Wodehouse frequently uses horse racing as a source of imagery. For example, Bertie describes how he, his Aunt Dahlia, and the butler Seppings rush to Anatole&#x27;s room in chapter 20 in a parody of race-reporting. For instance, Bertie remarks that &quot;I put down my plate and hastened after her, Seppings following at a loping gallop&quot; and that at the top of the first flight of stairs, Aunt Dahlia &quot;must have led by a matter of half a dozen lengths, and was still shaking off my challenge when she rounded into the second&quot;.

The humour in the speech of Aunt Dahlia&#x27;s French cook Anatole comes from the combination of informal British and American expressions with real or imaginary loan translations from French. The most extensive example of Anatole&#x27;s speech is his diatribe in chapter 20. To quote part of his speech: &quot;Hot dog! You ask me what is it? Listen. Make some attention a little. Me, I have hit the hay, but I do not sleep so good, and presently I wake and up I look, and there is one who makes faces against me through the dashed window&quot;. Anatole is similar to Jeeves, being a highly competent servant whose loss is a constant threat, though Anatole, while mentioned frequently, does not make an appearance in any other story; this distance differentiates him from Jeeves.

Jeeves sometimes denigrates Bertie in ways which are too subtle for Bertie to perceive, but obvious to readers. For example, in chapter 3, when Bertie is puzzled after Aunt Dahlia invites him to Brinkley Court, since he has just spent a two-month vacation with her. Bertie says to Jeeves:

&quot;But why, Jeeves? Dash it all, she&#x27;s just had nearly two months of me.&quot;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&quot;And many people consider the medium dose for an adult two days.&quot;&quot;Yes, sir. I appreciate the point you raise. Nevertheless, Mrs. Travers appears very insistent.&quot;

Jeeves&#x27;s reply, &quot;I appreciate the point you raise&quot;, carries an irony that Bertie apparently misses. However, since Jeeves invariably stays in Bertie&#x27;s employ, the quote suggests that Jeeves puts up with and even enjoys Bertie&#x27;s continuing society more than Bertie&#x27;s friends and relatives do.

In the novel, Aunt Dahlia uses the expression &quot;oom beroofen&quot;, which is derived from the German &quot;unberufen&quot; and means &quot;touch wood&quot; or &quot;knock on wood&quot;. Wodehouse previously used &quot;beroofen&quot; in &quot;The Gem Collector&quot; (1909).

==Background==
The book is dedicated to Raymond Needham KC, &quot;with affection and admiration&quot;. Needham had represented Wodehouse in a tax dispute case and won the case. According to Wodehouse scholar Richard Usborne, Needham had to talk Wodehouse out of using the original, more provocative dedication: &quot;To Raymond Needham KC, who put the tax-gatherers to flight when they had their feet on my neck and their hands in my wallet&quot; or words to that effect. Wodehouse actually befriended the tax inspector involved in the case.

==Publication history==
In the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, the story was illustrated by Henry Raleigh. The story was later printed in &quot;Men Only&quot; in April 1936. Along with &quot;The Inimitable Jeeves&quot; and &quot;Very Good, Jeeves&quot;, the novel was included in a collection titled &quot;Life With Jeeves&quot;, published in 1981 by Penguin Books.

The novel is in the public domain in the US.

==Reception==

* &quot;The Times&quot; (5 October 1934): &quot;On the principle that &#x27;spilt milk blows nobody any good,&#x27; Wooster, as usual, spills a few additional gallons of the milk of human imbecility, and awaits the consequences... When, at last, Jeeves clocks in, having resolved the initial discord to his own satisfaction, the young master pays the customary penalty for his good intentions—on this occasion a wholly futile bicycle ride of 18 miles in the dark. When he returns, Jeeves has done the trick, the place is stiff with happy endings, and Mr. Wodehouse has shown once again that all is for the funniest in the most ludicrous of worlds&quot;.
* Gerald Gould, &quot;The Observer&quot; (21 October 1934): &quot;Of the immortal Mr. Wodehouse, creator of the immortal Jeeves, it remains only to say the ever-incredible and ever-true—&#x27;He gets better and better.&#x27; Whereas one used to smile, one now rocks and aches with laughter. &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; is, in the phrase its author applies to a mess jacket, &#x27;one long scream from start to finish&#x27;&quot;.
* &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; (28 October 1934): &quot;Jeeves and Bertie Wooster here show up at their balmiest and best. Not to put too fine a point on the matter, &quot;Brinkley Manor&quot; is an authentic triumph, in the master&#x27;s best manner... The hilarious Wooster thought, on the occasion this story celebrates, that Jeeves (first gentleman among the world&#x27;s gentlemen&#x27;s gentlemen) had sprained his brain. So he took a turn at straightening out people&#x27;s lives... Fortunately, Jeeves went along too. As a matchmaker Bertie was industrious but terrible&quot;.
* In 1996, John Le Carré listed the work among his all-time favourite novels, stating: &quot;No library, however humble, is complete without its well-thumbed copy of &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves,&quot; by P.G. Wodehouse, which contains the immortal scene of Gussie Fink-Nottle, drunk to the gills, presenting the prizes to the delighted scholars of Market Snodsbury Grammar School&quot;.
* Stephen Fry, in an article titled &quot;What ho! My hero, PG Wodehouse&quot; (18 January 2000), remarks on the popularity of the work, especially the prize-giving episode: &quot;The masterly episode where Gussie Fink-Nottle presents the prizes at Market Snodsbury grammar school is frequently included in collections of great comic literature and has often been described as the single funniest piece of sustained writing in the language. I would urge you, however, to head straight for a library or bookshop and get hold of the complete novel Right Ho, Jeeves, where you will encounter it fully in context and find that it leaps even more magnificently to life.&quot; In late 2020, Fry would narrate the book and four others in a Jeeves audiobook for Audible. 
* Richard Usborne, in his book &quot;Plum Sauce: A P. G. Wodehouse Companion&quot; (2003), states that &quot;the prize-giving is a riot, probably the best-sustained and most anthologised two chapters of Wodehouse&quot;.
* In a 2009 internet poll, &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; was voted number one in the &quot;best comic book by English writer&quot; category.
* In July 2012, &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; editors Peder Zane and Elizabeth Drake listed &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; as number ten in a list of the ten best comic works in all of literature.

==Adaptations==

===Television===
The story was adapted into the &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; episodes &quot;The Hunger Strike&quot; and &quot;Will Anatole Return to Brinkley Court?&quot;, which first aired on 13 May 1990 and 20 May 1990. There are some changes, including:
* In the original story, Jeeves&#x27; initially suggests Gussie gain the courage to propose to Madeline by dressing as Mephistopheles. The party invite subplot was removed from the TV series, but the costume later appears in &quot;The Bassetts&#x27; Fancy Dress Ball&quot;.
* In the original story, Tom Travers has a pistol, which is never fired; in the first episode, he has a shotgun, which Bertie accidentally fires at a chandelier, after which Aunt Dahlia tells Bertie to go home. He returns to Brinkley Court in the following episode. 
* Anatole leaves Brinkley Court between the two episodes, and Jeeves is sent to convince him to return. 
* In the episode, Bertie does not find out that Jeeves spiked Gussie&#x27;s drink until after he himself has done so. 
* In the original story, Gussie eventually chooses to drink alcohol, and also unknowingly drinks the spiked orange juice; in the episode, he only drinks the spiked orange juice. 
* While running away from Tuppy in the episode, Gussie does not end up on the roof, a scene depicted in the first edition cover artwork.
* In the original story, Bertie was obliged to ride his bicycle at night without a lamp, and it was not raining; in the episode, he has a lamp, but it is raining heavily.

===Radio===

In the 1956 BBC Light Programme dramatisation of the novel, Deryck Guyler portrayed Jeeves and Naunton Wayne portrayed Bertie Wooster.

&quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; was adapted into a radio drama in 1973 as part of the series &quot;What Ho! Jeeves&quot; starring Michael Hordern as Jeeves and Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster.

BBC radio adapted the story for radio again in 1988. David Suchet portrayed Jeeves and Simon Cadell portrayed Bertie Wooster.

<doc id="729739" wikidata="Q483868" url="?curid=729739" title="Czech Republic national football team">
<text>The Czech Republic national football team (), recognised by FIFA as Czechia, represents the Czech Republic in men&#x27;s international football. The team is controlled by the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR). Historically, the team participated in FIFA and UEFA competitions as Bohemia and Czechoslovakia.

Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the first international competition of the Czech Republic was UEFA Euro 1996, where they finished runners-up. They have taken part at every European Championship since. Following the separation, they have featured at one FIFA World Cup, the 2006 tournament.

==History==
===1990s===

When Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Czech Republic team was formed. They played their first friendly match away to Turkey on 23 February 1994. The newly formed team played their first home game in Ostrava, against Lithuania, in which they registered their first home win.

Their first competitive match was part of the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying campaign, in which they defeated Malta 6–1 in Ostrava. During the campaign, the Czech Republic registered six wins, three draws, and a defeat against Luxembourg, finishing their qualifying Group 5 in first place, ahead of group favourites the Netherlands. In the final tournament, hosted by England, the Czechs progressed from the group stage, despite a 2–0 opening game defeat to Germany. They progressed to the UEFA Euro 1996 Final, losing 2–1 to Germany at Wembley Stadium.

The Czechs finished third in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifying group, behind Spain and Yugoslavia, and subsequently missed the tournament.

===2000s===
The Czech Republic qualified for Euro 2000, winning all of their group games and conceding five goals. In the finals the team were drawn in Group D, alongside France, the Netherlands and Denmark. The team lost to the Netherlands after a last-minute penalty and were defeated in second match by France, which eliminated them from advancing to the knockout round. The Czech Republic managed a 2–0 win against Denmark in their final game courtesy of two goals from Vladimír Šmicer.

Once again, the Czech Republic failed to qualify for the World Cup, this time finishing second in their 2002 qualification group, behind Denmark, and then being beaten 1–0 in both legs by Belgium in the UEFA play-offs for a place in the finals.

A team settled with Pavel Nedvěd, Jan Koller, Tomáš Rosický, Milan Baroš, Marek Jankulovski, Tomáš Galásek together with the emergence of goalkeeper Petr Čech were unbeaten in 2002 and 2003, scoring 53 goals in 19 games and qualifying for Euro 2004 in the process. The Czech Republic went on a 20-game unbeaten streak, which finally ended in Dublin on 31 March 2004 in a friendly match against the Republic of Ireland. The Czechs entered the Euro finals in Group D, alongside the Netherlands, Germany and Latvia. The team trailed 2–0 to the Netherlands before winning the game 3–2 and beat Germany in the final group match. The Czech Republic beat Denmark in the quarter-final, went into the semi-final against Greece and Tomáš Rosický hit the bar after just two minutes, Jan Koller had shots saved by the Greek goalkeeper and Pavel Nedvěd left the pitch injured in the end of the first half. The first 90 minutes finished goalless and Greece won the game in the last minute of the first half of extra-time with a silver goal.
The Czech Republic achieved their record win during the 2006 World Cup qualifying, thrashing Andorra 8–1 in a qualification match in Liberec. In the same match, Jan Koller became the all-time top scorer for the national team with his 35th international goal. At the end of the campaign, after finishing in second place in Group 1 and defeating Norway in a playoff, the Czechs qualified for their first World Cup. The team was boosted prior to the play-off matches by the return of Pavel Nedvěd, who had initially retired from international football after Euro 2004. The squad for the 2006 World Cup in Germany included 18 players from the Euro 2004 team. With the team ranked second in the world, they started the tournament with a 3–0 win over the United States. During the game, however, Jan Koller was forced to leave with a hamstring injury, exiting the tournament. In the next game, with Milan Baroš still recovering from injury, the team suffered a 2–0 loss to Ghana. Baroš returned for the final game against Italy, a must-win for a round of 16 appearance. The team were reduced to ten men as Jan Polák was dismissed before half-time for two bookable offences. Italy went on to win 2–0. Pavel Nedvěd, Karel Poborský and Vratislav Lokvenc retired from the national team after the tournament.

In the qualifying campaign for Euro 2008, they finished top of their group, above Germany on head-to-head record. The Czech Republic beat co-hosts Switzerland 1–0 in their opening game of the finals, before being beaten 3–1 by Portugal. This meant the Czechs and Turkey carried identical records going into the final group game. Although the Czechs took a 2–0 lead just past the hour mark and looked set to qualify, Turkey scored three goals in the final 15 minutes of the game to win the game 3–2.

The Czechs entered 2010 World Cup qualification, being drawn in Group 3, under the guidance of coach Petr Rada. They started with a 0–0 away draw against Northern Ireland, before losing to Poland. A late goal from Libor Sionko won the next game 1–0 against Slovenia. This was followed by a win against San Marino, and a goalless draw in Slovenia. In their following match, against neighbours Slovakia, a 2–1 defeat at home left Czech Republic in a precarious qualifying position. Manager Petr Rada was dismissed and six players were suspended. Ivan Hašek took temporary charge as manager, gaining four points from his first two matches, as the team drew away to group leaders Slovakia and thrashed San Marino 7–0 in Uherské Hradiště. They subsequently beat Poland in Prague but followed this result with a goalless draw against Northern Ireland, finishing third in the group and failing to qualify for the World Cup. Hašek announced his immediate resignation.

===2010s===
A changed team under Michal Bílek entered the Euro 2012 qualifiers and began with a home loss to Lithuania. But a win at home to Scotland was followed by wins against Liechtenstein. Spain defeated Czech Republic in between the Liechtenstein games, but the play-off spot was still in their hands. In the next game, a last minute penalty from Michal Kadlec away to Scotland secured a 2–2 draw. Despite Scotland winning their next two games and the Czechs again being defeated by Spain, the team could finish second if they could beat Lithuania away from home in the final game, assuming Spain would beat Scotland at home. Spain won 3–1 and Czech Republic defeated Lithuania 4–1 to seal second spot and a place in the play-offs. Czech Republic were drawn to face Montenegro in the two-legged play-off. A goal from Václav Pilař and a last minute second from Tomáš Sivok helped the Czechs to a 2–0 first leg lead. In the second leg in Podgorica, a late goal from Petr Jiráček sealed a 1–0 win and the Czechs ran out 3–0 aggregate winners and qualified for Euro 2012.

At the tournament, the Czechs lost their opening game 4–1 to Russia, with their only goal coming from Václav Pilař. In their second match, against Greece, the Czech Republic went 2–0 up within the first six minutes thanks to goals from Petr Jiráček and a second from Pilař. Following the half-time substitution of captain Tomáš Rosický, Greece scored a second-half goal following a mistake from Czech goalkeeper Petr Čech, although there were no more goals and the Czech Republic recorded their first win of the tournament. Going into their third and final group match, the Czech Republic needed at least a draw against co-hosts Poland to advance to the knockout stage. A second-half strike by Jiráček proved the difference between the teams as the Czechs ran out as 1–0 winners. Due to Greece beating Russia in the other group game, the Czech Republic subsequently finished top of Group A, becoming the first team ever to win a group at the European Championships with a negative goal difference.

Bílek stayed on as coach, despite unrest amongst fans, and was tasked with qualifying for the 2014 World Cup. The Czechs were drawn into UEFA qualifying Group B along with Italy, Denmark, Bulgaria, Armenia and Malta. The campaign started with goalless draws against Denmark and Bulgaria, paired with a narrow win against Malta. The team then lost 0–3 to Denmark at home. The Czechs were then able to beat Armenia and draw with group leaders Italy, but lost to both Armenia and Italy in the rematches. Bílek resigned after the loss and was replaced with assistant coach Josef Pešice.

Pavel Vrba was appointed as the team&#x27;s new coach in 2014, ahead of Euro 2016 qualifying. The Czech team was drawn into Group A, along with Netherlands, Turkey, Iceland, Latvia and Kazakhstan. The Czech team began with a win, defeating Netherlands, and followed up with victories over Turkey, Kazakhstan and Iceland, leaving them as group leaders with maximum points after four matches. A draw at home against Latvia followed; nonetheless, Czech Republic remained group leaders, and on 6 September 2015, qualified for their sixth European Championship. They only got one point from a draw with Croatia, losing to Spain and Turkey. During a friendly match against Australia on 1 June 2018, the Czechs recorded their biggest defeat losing 0–4 in Sankt Pölten, Austria. That would eventually be eclipsed during their first qualifier for Euro 2020, as they were beaten 0–5 at Wembley Stadium by England.

On the other hand, they qualified directly for Euro 2020, finishing 2nd in Group A during the qualifiers, with a record of five wins and three defeats in eight games. The team won at home against England, the group leader (2–1) and lost all three away matches, against England (0–5), Kosovo (1–2) and Bulgaria (0–1).

===2020s===
On 18 November 2020, the Czech Republic, then placed in Group 2 of League B in the 2020–2021 edition of the Nations League, obtained promotion to League A for the next edition thanks to a win at home against Slovakia on the last day of the group stages (2–0), allowing the National team to overtake Scotland, which was defeated in Israel (0–1) at the same time. The Czechs were drawn into Group D with qualification opponents England, along with Croatia as well as Scotland.

2021 started on a positive note for the Czech Republic, who managed to draw Belgium at home 1–1 in the qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup. Above all, the Euros, postponed to the summer of 2021 due to COVID-19, saw the Czech men advance from the group. The Czech Republic won the first game against Scotland, who were one of 12 host countries for the Euros, with a double from Patrik Schick (2–0), including a long-range goal. The Czechs then drew 1–1 against Croatia before losing to England at Wembley 1–0. The Czechs finished among the four best third-place teams. In the round of 16 the Czech Republic faced the Netherlands, surprising them with a 2–0 win with goals from Tomáš Holeš and Patrik Schick while the Dutch team finished the game with 10 players. Appearing in the quarter-finals for the first time since 2012, they were beaten by Denmark 2–1, having conceded the first Danish goal after 5 minutes of play due to a refereeing error caused by a non-existent corner.

The Czech Republic failed to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar, finishing third in their group, behind Belgium and Wales, whom they failed to beat (home draw and away defeat in both cases), but they made it to the play-offs thanks to their position in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League. They were eliminated in the semi-finals of the B path, following an away defeat against Sweden in extra time (1–0). They were then relegated to League B after finishing bottom of their group in the 2022–2023 Nations League.

The Czech Republic, without injured star striker Schick for the entire Euro 2024 qualifying campaign, had a difficult and chaotic campaign, but qualified for the Euros in Germany by finishing second in their qualifying group thanks to a 3–0 home win over Moldova on the final day. After qualifying, coach Jaroslav Šilhavý resigned in the face of criticism from fans and controversy surrounding some of the team&#x27;s players.

On 4 January 2024, Ivan Hašek returned to the Czech football team as the head coach until November 2025, with an option to continue if the team qualifies for the 2026 World Cup. He went on to make his debut against Norway and Armenia, both of which were 2–1 victories.
In the Euro 2024, the Czech Republic failed to qualify to the Round of 16, losing 2–1 to Portugal, which was followed by a 1–1 draw to Georgia with many opportunities missed, and a 2–1 loss to Turkey in the final match of the group after being quickly reduced to 10 players following a second yellow card for Antonín Barák, the third time that Czech Republic lost in the decisive game against Turkey after Euro 2008 and Euro 2016. They ended 4th in Group F.

==Team image==

Since 1994, the Czech Republic home kit has primarily been red shirts, with either blue or red shorts. While their away kit has been white shirts with white shorts. Although the team wore blue shorts for a short period between 2010 and 2011. In 2020 the team introduced a new alternate colour as the away kit for the first time.

==Stadiums==
14 different cities have hosted Czech Republic football matches between 1994 and 2023. The most commonly-used stadium was Stadion Letná, the home stadium of Sparta Prague, which was renovated in 1994. Another frequently used stadium was Na Stínadlech in Teplice. However, since the 2018 World Cup qualification, major matches are usually played at the newer Stadion Eden, the home stadium of Slavia Prague, which was built in 2008. Since 2012, competitive games have also been held Doosan Arena, Plzeň. Some matches are also played in Moravia at Andrův stadion in Olomouc and Městský stadion in Ostrava.

<doc id="729741" wikidata="Q415833" url="?curid=729741" title="Acanthosis nigricans">
<text>Acanthosis nigricans is a medical sign characterised by brown-to-black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmentation of the skin. It is usually found in body folds, such as the posterior and lateral folds of the neck, the armpits, groin, navel, forehead and other areas.

It is associated with endocrine dysfunction, especially insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, as seen in diabetes mellitus. This activates the insulin-like growth factor receptors, which leads to proliferation of keratinocytes, fibroblasts and other cells in the skin. Activation of other growth factor receptors such as fibroblast growth factor receptors or epidermal growth factor receptor can also be responsible.

==Signs and symptoms==
Acanthosis nigricans appears as dark brown-black, poorly defined, velvety patches of skin, typically affecting the face, neck, underarms, genitals, groin, elbows, knees, anus, umbilicus and nasal crease.

==Causes==
It typically occurs in individuals younger than age 40, is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, obesity or endocrinopathies, such as hypothyroidism, acromegaly, polycystic ovary syndrome or Cushing&#x27;s disease, and may be genetically inherited.

===Type I – familial===
Familial acanthosis may arise as a result of an autosomal dominant trait, presenting at birth or developing during childhood.

===Type II – endocrine===
Endocrine syndromes associated with acanthosis nigricans can develop in many conditions, particularly: 
* starts with insulin resistance, such as diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome
* excess circulating androgens, particularly Cushing&#x27;s disease, acromegaly, polycystic ovary syndrome
* Addison&#x27;s disease and hypothyroidism
* Rare diseases, including pinealoma, leprechaunism, lipoatrophic diabetes, pineal hyperplasia syndrome, pituitary basophilism, ovarian hyperthecosis, stromal luteoma, ovarian dermoid cysts, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Alström syndrome.

Acanthosis nigricans associated with endocrine dysfunction is more insidious in its onset, is less widespread, and the patients are often concurrently obese.
===Type III – obesity and pseudoacanthosis nigricans===
In young persons, acanthosis nigricans is a visible marker which strongly suggests insulin resistance. Higher than normal insulin levels in the blood stream cause the growth of darkened skin over certain areas of the body. No skin treatment will cure it, but acanthosis nigricans may lighten up and possibly disappear by treating the root cause, insulin resistance, but it can take months or years to do so. Insulin resistance syndromes may be divided into type A (HAIR-AN) and type B syndromes.

The majority of cases of acanthosis nigricans are associated with obesity and otherwise idiopathic. This is likely because of insulin resistance and more likely to occur in darker-skinned persons. This can also be referred to as pseudoacanthosis nigricans. In some cases, AN attributable to obesity and insulin resistance will occur on ones face. Most typically it will be present as a horizontal band on the forehead, but may also appear as perioral hyperpigmentation, periorbital hyperpigmentation, or generalized facial skin darkening.

===Type IV – drug-related===
Acanthosis nigricans has been linked to the use of nicotinic acid, glucocorticoid use, combined oral contraceptive pills, and growth hormone therapy.

=== Type V – malignancy ===
Malignant acanthosis nigricans refers to acanthosis nigricans occurring as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with a cancer. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, as well as genitourinary cancers such as those of the prostate, breast, and ovary. Other cancers, such as those of the lung, stomach, and lymphoma, are occasionally associated with acanthosis nigricans.

This form of acanthosis nigricans is more likely to involve mucous membranes (25–50% of cases) Malignant acanthosis nigricans that may either precede (18%), accompany (60%), or follow (22%) the onset of an internal cancer. Malignancy-associated acanthosis nigricans is usually rapid in onset and may be accompanied by skin tags, multiple seborrheic keratoses, or tripe palms.

===Acral acanthotic anomaly===
Acral acanthotic anomaly refers to a variant of acanthosis nigricans limited to the elbows, knees, knuckles, and dorsal surfaces of the feet, in the absence of any other findings, in otherwise healthy individuals. While the etiology remains unknown, its presence does not suggest a likelihood of malignancy.

==Pathophysiology==
Acanthosis nigricans is caused by increased activation of growth factor receptor proteins, usually due to endocrine dysfunction. This is most commonly insulin-mediated activation of IGF receptors on keratinocytes, as a result of hyperinsulinaemia or insulin resistance, as seen in diabetes mellitus.

Factors involved in the development of acanthosis nigricans include:
* Increased circulating insulin. This activates keratinocyte IGF receptors, particularly IGF-1. At high concentrations, insulin may also displace IGF-1 from insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP). Increased circulating IGF may lead to keratinocyte and dermal fibroblast proliferation.
* In hereditary forms of acanthosis nigricans, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) defects
* Increased transforming growth factor (TGF), which appears to be the mechanism for malignancy-associated acanthosis nigricans. TGF acts on epidermal tissue via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

In conjunction with increased end levels of IGF, it is likely that perspiration and friction may be necessary predeterminants for lesions, since the level of insulin is usually not enough to activate IGF receptors across the body.

==Diagnosis==
Acanthosis nigricans is typically diagnosed clinically. A skin biopsy may be needed in unusual cases. If no clear cause is obvious, it may be necessary to search for one. Blood tests, an endoscopy, or X-rays may be required to eliminate the possibility of diabetes or cancer as the cause.

On biopsy, hyperkeratosis, epidermal folding, leukocyte infiltration, and melanocyte proliferation may be seen.

===Classification===
Acanthosis nigricans is conventionally divided into benign and malignant forms, although may be divided into syndromes according to cause:
* Benign: This may include obesity-related, hereditary, and endocrine forms of acanthosis nigricans.
* Malignant: This may include forms that are associated with tumour products and insulin-like activity, or tumour necrosis factor.

An alternate classification system still used to describe acanthosis nigricans was proposed in 1994. It delineates acanthosis nigricans syndromes according to their associated syndromes, including benign and malignant forms, forms associated with obesity and drugs, acral acanthosis nigricans, unilateral acanthosis nigricans, and mixed and syndromic forms.

==Treatment==
People with acanthosis nigricans should be screened for diabetes and, although rare, cancer. Controlling blood glucose levels through exercise and diet often improves symptoms. Topical fade creams (normally used for eliminating age spots) can lighten skin cosmetically in less severe cases. Selenium sulfide topical 2 percent applied in thin layer to dry skin ten minutes prior to bathing may clear symptoms. Selenium sulfide applied to dry scalp or skin is an inexpensive well tolerated treatment to balance skin&#x27;s biome and works by drying fungus like tinea versicolor that can coexist with acanthosis and exacerbate discoloration. Acanthosis nigricans maligna may resolve if the causative tumor is successfully removed.

==Prognosis==
Acanthosis nigricans is likely to improve in circumstances where a known cause is removed. For example, obesity-related acanthosis nigricans will improve with weight loss, and drug-induced acanthosis nigricans is likely to resolve when the drug is ceased. Hereditary variants may or may not fade with age, and malignancy-associated variants may, after a malignancy is removed, fade. 

==History==
AN was first reported by Unna in 1889.

<doc id="729746" wikidata="Q1331116" url="?curid=729746" title="Alport syndrome">
<text>Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting around 1 in 5,000–10,000 children, characterized by glomerulonephritis, end-stage kidney disease, and hearing loss. Alport syndrome can also affect the eyes, though the changes do not usually affect vision, except when changes to the lens occur in later life. Blood in urine is universal. Proteinuria is a feature as kidney disease progresses.

The disorder was first identified in a British family by the physician Cecil A. Alport in 1927. Alport syndrome once also had the label hereditary nephritis, but this is misleading as there are many other causes of hereditary kidney disease and &#x27;nephritis&#x27;.

Alport syndrome is caused by an inherited defect in type IV collagen—a structural material needed for the normal function of different body parts. Since type IV collagen is found in the ears, eyes, and kidneys, this explains why Alport syndrome affects different seemingly unrelated parts of the body (ears, eyes, kidneys, etc.).

Depending on where the mutation is located in the genome, Alport syndrome can present itself in many forms. This includes X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS), autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS), and autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS).
== Signs and symptoms ==
These descriptions refer to &#x27;classic&#x27; Alport syndrome, which usually causes significant disease from young adult or late childhood life. Some individuals, usually with milder mutations or &#x27;carrier&#x27; status, develop disease later, or show only some of the features of classic disease.

=== Chronic kidney disease ===
Blood in urine is a usual feature of Alport syndrome from early infancy, identifiable on urine dipsticks. In young children, episodes of visible (macroscopic) haematuria may occur. Protein begins to appear in urine as the disease progresses. This is now regarded as an indication for treatment with ACE inhibitors. Progressive loss of kidney function (reflected clinically by increases in serum creatinine or decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate) can occur and may require treatment with renal replacement: dialysis or a kidney transplant.

=== Hearing loss ===
Alport syndrome can also cause hearing loss although some patients are not affected. Hearing in Alport syndrome patients is normal at birth. Hearing loss in affected patients develops progressively, usually at the stage when kidney function is normal, but there is substantial proteinuria. However, in some patients, hearing loss is only noted after kidney function has been lost. Characteristically the early changes are reduced ability to hear high-frequency sounds, sensorineural deafness. This becomes more severe and affects lower frequencies too. Hearing loss is not usually complete in Alport syndrome; good communication is almost always possible with the use of hearing aids.

=== Eye changes ===
Various eye abnormalities are often seen including lenticonus, keratoconus, cataracts and corneal erosion as well as retinal flecks in the macula and mid-periphery. These rarely threaten vision. Lenticonus (cone-shaped lens) can be treated by replacement of the lens, as for cataracts. Mild keratoconus can be managed with hard, scleral, piggy-back or other specialty medical contact lenses; progressive cases may be halted with corneal collagen cross-linking; and severe cases may require a corneal transplant. Macular abnormalities such as incomplete foveal hypoplasia or staircase foveopathy are common in Alport syndrome.

It may also be associated with retinitis pigmentosa.

=== Leiomyomatosis ===
Diffuse leiomyomatosis of the oesophagus and tracheobronchial tree has been reported in some families with Alport syndrome. Symptoms usually appear in late childhood and include dysphagia, postprandial vomiting, substernal or epigastric pain, recurrent bronchitis, dyspnea, cough, and stridor. Leiomyomatosis is confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

=== Other abnormalities ===
Aortic dissection has been described very rarely in patients with early-onset disease. Leiomyomas, tumours of smooth muscle affecting the oesophagus and female genital tract, may occur in a rare overlap syndrome involving the adjacent &quot;COL4A5&quot; and &quot;COL4A6&quot; genes.

==Pathophysiology==
Alport Syndrome is a relatively common genetic disorder affecting around 1 in 5,000-10,000 children. 

=== Genetics ===
Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in &quot;COL&quot;4A3, &quot;COL4A4&quot;, and &quot;COL4A5&quot;, three of six human genes involved in basement membrane (type IV) collagen biosynthesis. Mutations in any of these genes prevent the proper production or assembly of the specialised type IV collagen &#x27;345&#x27; network which is an important structural component of basement membranes in the kidney, inner ear, and eye. It is also found in other locations, including the alveoli of the lungs. Basement membranes are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen &#x27;112&#x27; type is found in both vertebrates and invertebrates and is the major isoform in most human basement membranes. When mutations prevent the formation of 345 type IV collagen network in the glomerulus, the 112 network, which is formed in fetal development but usually replaced by 345, persists into adult life.

====Inheritance patterns====
Alport syndrome can have different inheritance patterns depending on which specific mutation is present.
* In most people with Alport syndrome (about 85%), the condition is inherited in an X-linked pattern, due to mutations in the &quot;COL4A5&quot; gene. A condition is considered X-linked if the gene involved in the disorder is located on the X chromosome. In males, who have only one X chromosome, one altered copy of the &quot;COL4A5&quot; gene is sufficient to cause severe Alport syndrome, explaining why most affected males eventually develop kidney failure. In females, who have two X chromosomes, a mutation in one copy of the &quot;COL4A5&quot; gene usually results in blood in the urine, but most affected females do not develop kidney failure.
* Alport syndrome can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern if both copies of the &quot;COL4A3&quot; or &quot;COL4A4&quot; gene, located on chromosome 2, have been mutated. Most often, the parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.
* Past descriptions of an autosomal dominant form are now usually categorized as other conditions. Notably, conditions associated with giant platelets and associated with mutations of &quot;MYH9&quot; are no longer considered to be Alport variants. However apparent autosomal dominant transmission of disease associated with mutations in &quot;COL4A3&quot; and &quot;COL4A4&quot; does occur.

Clinical utility gene card for: Alport syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis can usually be made on a combination of clinical, family history, and biopsy criteria.

=== Biopsy of kidneys or skin ===
To be helpful, kidney biopsies need to be taken before the disease is too advanced. Changes in conventional (light) microscopy are not characteristic, and the possibility of other diagnoses, particularly focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), may be raised. Electron microscopy shows a characteristic sequence of changes from thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), developing into areas of thinning and thickening, and finally into a complex appearance with apparent splitting, often described as a &#x27;basketweave&#x27; appearance. Early or very localised changes on this spectrum are not diagnostic, but the later changes are considered diagnostic.

Immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence studies to identify the COL3-4-5 proteins in GBM can be helpful. However, these studies may be normal in some patients with Alport syndrome, especially milder variants.

The skin contains type IV collagen in a &#x27;556&#x27; network. Skin biopsies have been used to show the absence of the &quot;COL4A5&quot; gene product, but these techniques are not straightforward, only apply to patients with severe &quot;COL4A5&quot; mutations, and are not widely available. Genetic testing is now a better alternative if kidney biopsy is not possible.

=== Family history ===
A family history of end-stage renal disease with hearing impairment is suggestive of Alport syndrome, but other conditions can cause this combination of abnormalities. Most can be distinguished by clinical features. The finding of haematuria in relatives is suggestive.
While X-linked inheritance is the most common pattern, genetic testing is revealing that atypical presentations may be more common than currently thought.

=== Genetic testing ===
Genetic testing plays an increasingly important role in confirming the diagnosis where the clinical features do not amount to proof.

=== Other tests ===
The use of eye examinations for screening has been proposed. Other tests may include a urine or blood test.

==Treatment==

=== Kidney disease and kidney failure ===
In addition to measures for chronic kidney disease (CKD) of any cause, there is evidence that ACE inhibitors can slow the deterioration of kidney function in Alport syndrome, delaying the need for dialysis or transplantation. The development of proteinuria has been recommended as an indication for commencing treatment.

Once kidney failure has developed, patients usually do well on dialysis or with a kidney transplant. Transplantation can rarely be associated with the formation of antibodies to type IV collagen in the donor kidney resulting in progressive graft failure as a result of Goodpasture syndrome (&#x27;Alport post-transplant anti-GBM disease&#x27;).

Gene therapy has been frequently discussed, but delivering it to the podocytes in the glomerulus that normally produce the type IV collagen in the glomerular basement membrane is challenging.

=== Hearing loss ===
It is not known whether ACE inhibitors or other treatments affect hearing loss. For those with classic Alport syndrome, hearing aids are often required in teenage or young adult years.

== Prognosis ==
Studies of the life expectancy of patients with Alport syndrome are rare, but one 2012 study found that Alport patients receiving renal replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation) exhibited, on average, better survival compared with matched controls who had other kidney diseases (and who also received renal replacement therapy).

<doc id="729750" wikidata="Q713497" url="?curid=729750" title="Shigeyoshi Inoue">
<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. He was commander of the Japanese 4th Fleet and later served as Vice-Minister of the Navy. A noted naval theorist, he was a strong advocate of naval aviation within the Japanese Navy. General (Prime Minister) Nobuyuki Abe was his brother-in-law.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Shigeyoshi Inoue was born on December 9, 1889, in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, the eleventh son of a vineyard owner and former samurai retainer Kanori Inoue. His name Shigeyoshi, consisting of the &quot;kanji&quot; 成 (to achieve) and 美 (beauty), was derived from a passage in &quot;Analects&quot; by Yan Hui saying &quot;The Master said, the man of virtue seeks to achieve the beautiful qualities of men and does not seek to achieve their bad qualities. The small man does the opposite of this&quot;. Shigeyoshi, who was taught by his father to become a man like this, took great pride in this name.

===Early career===
Inoue attended the 37th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, graduating second out of a class of 179 cadets in 1909. As a midshipman, he was assigned to the cruiser on its 1909 cruise from Dairen to Chemulpo, Chinkai, Sasebo and Tsu. He stayed with &quot;Soya&quot; on its cruise the following year to Manila, Ambon, Townsville, Brisbane, Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne, Fremantle, Batavia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Makung, and Keelung. On his return, he was assigned to the battleship , and then the cruiser .

===Overseas experience===
Shortly after his promotion to ensign on December 15, 1910, he was reassigned to the cruiser and attended the coronation ceremonies for King George V in London in 1911. In 1912, he returned to school to study latest naval artillery and submarine warfare techniques and was promoted to sub-lieutenant at the end of that year. In 1913, he served on the cruiser , followed by the battleship . He was promoted to lieutenant at the end of 1915, and transferred to the battleship . Although &quot;Fusō&quot; participated in operations in World War I against the Imperial German Navy, Inoue was not in any combat situations.

At the end of 1918, Inoue was appointed military attaché to Switzerland, and ordered by the Navy to learn German. In 1919, he was part of the Japanese diplomatic delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, where this knowledge proved to be useful. In 1920, he was appointed military attaché to France, and was then ordered to learn French. In December 1921, he received a promotion to lieutenant commander, and was permitted to return to Japan.

After serving as executive officer on the in 1923, Inoue enrolled in the Naval Staff College, graduating 3rd in a class of 21 the following year from the 22nd class. On December 1, 1925, he was promoted to commander. Inoue remained in staff positions for the next several years, including an appointment as naval attaché to Italy from 1927 to 1929, after which he was promoted to captain.

===As admiral===
On November 15, 1933, Inoue was given command of &quot;Hiei&quot;. However, his administrative talents could not be overlooked, and he returned to shore duties after slightly over a year and a half. Inoue was a protégé of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and was strongly opposed to the Tripartite Pact with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Inoue was a leader of the &quot;leftist clique&quot; within the Japanese military, which opposed Japan&#x27;s increasing trend towards fascism and overseas expansionism.

Promoted to rear admiral on November 15, 1935, Inoue was made vice commander of the IJN 3rd Fleet, which covered the China theater of operations in 1939 and further promoted to vice admiral the same year. As with Yamamoto, he was a strong proponent of naval aviation. Inoue was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (first class) in 1940.

In 1940, Inoue became commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy Aviation Bureau, and submitted his thesis for a radical restructuring of the Imperial Japanese Navy to Naval Minister Koshirō Oikawa early in 1941. He was highly critical of the Navy&#x27;s shipbuilding programme, with its emphasis on battleships over aircraft carriers. Inoue was given command of the IJN Fourth Fleet later the same year, based out of Truk. He was thus in command of Japanese naval forces during the Battle of Guam and Battle of Wake Island. He subsequently relocated his headquarters to Rabaul for Operation Mo, intended to occupy Port Moresby. However, after the Japanese defeat at the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, he was relieved of his command in October, and returned to Japan to become commander of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. He became Vice Minister of the Navy in the closing stages of World War II, was promoted to full admiral on May 15, 1945 (one of the last two promotions made to this rank), and officially retired on October 15 of the same year.

After the war, Inoue became an English and music teacher to children at his house in Yokosuka. The site of his home is now a public park.
However, this site was closed due to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake.

His grave is at Tama Cemetery in Fuchū, Tokyo, Japan.

<text>Soar is a cognitive architecture, originally created by John Laird, Allen Newell, and Paul Rosenbloom at Carnegie Mellon University. 

The goal of the Soar project is to develop the fixed computational building blocks necessary for general intelligent agents – agents that can perform a wide range of tasks and encode, use, and learn all types of knowledge to realize the full range of cognitive capabilities found in humans, such as decision making, problem solving, planning, and natural-language understanding. It is both a theory of what cognition is and a computational implementation of that theory. Since its beginnings in 1983 as John Laird’s thesis, it has been widely used by AI researchers to create intelligent agents and cognitive models of different aspects of human behavior. The most current and comprehensive description of Soar is the 2012 book, &quot;The Soar Cognitive Architecture.&quot;

Rosenbloom continued to serve as co-principal investigator after moving to Stanford University, then to the University of Southern California&#x27;s Information Sciences Institute. It is now maintained and developed by John Laird&#x27;s research group at the University of Michigan.
==Theory==
Soar embodies multiple hypotheses about the computational structures underlying general intelligence, many of which are shared with other cognitive architectures, including ACT-R, which was created by John R. Anderson, and LIDA, which was created by Stan Franklin. Recently, the emphasis on Soar has been on general AI (functionality and efficiency), whereas the emphasis on ACT-R has always been on cognitive modeling (detailed modeling of human cognition).

The original theory of cognition underlying Soar is the Problem Space Hypothesis, which is described in Allen Newell&#x27;s book, &quot;Unified Theories of Cognition&quot;. and dates back to one of the first AI systems created, Newell, Simon, and Shaw&#x27;s Logic Theorist, first presented in 1955 and as the 
General Problem Solver in 1957. The Problem Space Hypothesis contends that all goal-oriented behavior can be cast as search through a space of possible states (a &quot;problem space&quot;) while attempting to achieve a goal. At each step, a single operator is selected, and then applied to the agent’s current state, which can lead to internal changes, such as retrieval of knowledge from long-term memory or modifications or external actions in the world. (Soar’s name is derived from this basic cycle of State, Operator, And Result; however, it is no longer regarded as an acronym.) Inherent to the Problem Space Hypothesis is that all behavior, even a complex activity such as planning, is decomposable into a sequence of selection and application of primitive operators, which when mapped onto human behavior take ~50ms.

A second hypothesis of Soar’s theory is that although only a single operator can be selected at each step, forcing a serial bottleneck, the processes of selection and application are implemented through parallel rule firings, which provide context-dependent retrieval of procedural knowledge.

A third hypothesis is that if the knowledge to select or apply an operator is incomplete or uncertain, an impasse arises and the architecture automatically creates a substate. In the substate, the same process of problem solving is recursively used, but with the goal to retrieve or discover knowledge so that decision making can continue. This can lead to a stack of substates, where traditional problem methods, such as planning or hierarchical task decomposition, naturally arise. When results created in the substate resolve the impasse, the substate and its associated structures are removed. The overall approach is called Universal Subgoaling.

These assumptions lead to an architecture that supports three levels of processing. At the lowest level, is bottom-up, parallel, and automatic processing. The next level is the deliberative level, where knowledge from the first level is used to propose, select, and apply a single action. These two levels implement fast, skilled behavior, and roughly correspond to Kahneman’s System 1 processing level. More complex behavior arises automatically when knowledge is incomplete or uncertain, through a third level of processing using substates, roughly corresponding to System 2.

A fourth hypothesis in Soar is that the underlying structure is modular, but not in terms of task or capability based modules, such as planning or language, but instead as task independent modules including: a decision making module; memory modules (short-term spatial/visual and working memories; long-term procedural, declarative, and episodic memories), learning mechanisms associated with all long-term memories; and perceptual and motor modules. There are further assumptions about the specific properties of these memories described below, including that all learning is online and incremental.

A fifth hypothesis is that memory elements (except those in the spatial/visual memory) are represented as symbolic, relational structures. The hypothesis that a symbolic system is necessary for general intelligence is known as the &quot;physical symbol system hypothesis&quot;. An important evolution in Soar is that all symbolic structures have associated statistical metadata (such as information on recency and frequency of use, or expected future reward) that influences retrieval, maintenance, and learning of the symbolic structures.

==Architecture==

===Processing cycle – decision procedure===
Soar’s main processing cycle arises from the interaction between procedural memory (its knowledge about how to do things) and working memory (its representation of the current situation) to support the selection and application of operators. Information in working memory is represented as a symbolic graph structure, rooted in a &quot;state.&quot; The knowledge in procedural memory is represented as if-then rules (sets of conditions and actions), that are continually matched against the contents of working memory. When the conditions of a rule matches structures in working memory, it &quot;fires&quot; and performs its actions. This combination of rules and working memory is also called a production system. In contrast to most production systems, in Soar, all rules that match, fire in parallel.

Instead of having the selection of a single rule being the crux of decision making, Soar’s decision making occurs through the selection and applications of &quot;operators&quot;, that are proposed, evaluated, and applied by rules. An operator is proposed by rules that test the current state and create a representation of the operator in working memory as well as an &quot;acceptable preference&quot;, which indicates that the operator should be considered for selection and application. Additional rules match with the proposed operator and create additional preferences that compare and evaluate it against other proposed operators. The preferences are analyzed by a decision procedure, which selects the preferred operator and installs it as the current operator in working memory. Rules that match the current operator then fire to apply it and make changes to working memory. The changes to working memory can be simple inferences, queries for retrieval from Soar’s long-term semantic or episodic memories, commands to the motor system to perform actions in an environment, or interactions with the Spatial Visual System (SVS), which is working memory’s interface to perception. These changes to working memory lead to new operators being proposed and evaluated, followed by the selection of one and its application.

===Reinforcement learning===
Soar supports reinforcement learning, which tunes the values of rules that create numeric preferences for evaluating operators, based on reward. To provide maximal flexibility, there is a structure in working memory where reward is created.

===Impasses, substates, and chunking===
If the preferences for the operators are insufficient to specify the selection of a single operator, or there are insufficient rules to apply an operator, an impasse arises. In response to an impasse, a substate is created in working memory, with the goal being to resolve the impasse. Additional procedural knowledge can then propose and select operators in the substate to gain more knowledge, and either create preferences in the original state or modify that state so the impasse is resolved. Substates provide a means for on-demand complex reasoning, including hierarchical task decomposition, planning, and access to the declarative long-term memories. Once the impasse is resolved, all of the structures in the substate are removed except for any results. Soar’s chunking mechanism compiles the processing in the substate which led to results into rules. In the future, the learned rules automatically fire in similar situations so that no impasse arises, incrementally converting complex reasoning into automatic/reactive processing. Recently, the overall Universal Subgoaling procedure has been extended through a mechanism of goal-directed and automatic knowledge base augmentation that allows to solve an impasse by recombining, in an innovative and problem-oriented way, the knowledge possessed by a Soar agent.

===Symbolic input and output===
Symbolic input and output occurs through working memory structures attached to the top state called the input-link and the output-link. If structures are created on the output-link in working memory, these are translated into commands for external actions (e.g., motor control).

===Spatial visual system and mental imagery===
To support interaction with vision systems and non-symbolic reasoning, Soar has its Spatial Visual System (SVS). SVS internally represents the world as a &quot;scene graph&quot;, a collection of objects and component subobjects each with spatial properties such as shape, location, pose, relative position, and scale. A Soar agent using SVS can create filters to automatically extract features and relations from its scene graph, which are then added to working memory. In addition, a Soar agent can add structures to SVS and use it for mental imagery. For example, an agent can create a hypothetical object in SVS at a given location and query to see if it collides with any perceived objects.

===Semantic memory===
Semantic Memory (SMEM) in Soar is designed to be a very large long-term memory of fact-like structures. Data in SMEM is represented as directed cyclic graphs. Structures can be stored or retrieved by rules that create commands in a reserved area of working memory. Retrieved structures are added to working memory.

SMEM structures have activation values that represent the frequency or recency of usage of each memory, implementing the &quot;base-level activation&quot; scheme originally developed for ACT-R. During retrieval, the structure in SMEM that matches the query and has the highest activation is retrieved. Soar also supports &quot;spreading activation&quot;, where activation spreads from SMEM structures that have been retrieved into working memory to other long-term memories that they are linked to. These memories in turn spread activation to their neighbor memories, with some decay. Spreading activation is a mechanism for allowing the current context to influence retrievals from semantic memory.

===Episodic memory===
Episodic Memory (EPMEM) automatically records snapshots of working memory in a temporal stream. Prior episodes can be retrieved into working memory through query. Once an episode has been retrieved, the next (or previous) episode can then be retrieved. An agent may employ EPMEM to sequentially play through episodes from its past (allowing it to predict the effects of actions), retrieve specific memories, or query for episodes possessing certain memory structures.

===Learning===
Each of Soar’s long-term memories have associated online learning mechanisms that create new structures or modify metadata based on an agent’s experience. For example, Soar learns new rules for procedural memory through a process called &quot;chunking&quot; and uses reinforcement learning to tune rules involved in the selection of operators.

==Agent development==
The standard approach to developing an agent in Soar starts with writing rules that are loaded into procedural memory, and initializing semantic memory with appropriate declarative knowledge. 
The process of agent development is explained in detail in the official Soar manual as well as in several tutorials which are provided at the research group&#x27;s website.

==Software==

The Soar architecture is currently maintained and extended by the Center for Integrated Cognition (CIC), a research group led by John Laird and Robert Wray. The current architecture is written in a combination of C and C++, and is freely available (BSD license) at the project&#x27;s website.

Soar can interface with external language environments including C++, Java, Tcl, and Python through SWIG-based bindings included with its distribution. The bindings use a communication protocol based on the Soar Markup Language (SML). SML is a primary mechanism for creating instances of Soar agents and interacting with their I/O links.

The Soar distribution also includes several Java-based tools, including a debugger, an editor, and several environments used in the Soar tutorial.

JSoar is an implementation of Soar written in Java. It is maintained by SoarTech, an AI research and development company. JSoar closely follows the University of Michigan architecture implementation, although it generally does not reflect the latest developments and changes of that C/C++ version.

==Applications==
Below is a historical list of different areas of applications that have been implemented in Soar. There have been over a hundred systems implemented in Soar, although the vast majority of them are toy tasks or puzzles.

===Puzzles and games===
Throughout its history, Soar has been used to implement a wide variety of classic AI puzzles and games, such as Tower of Hanoi, Water Jug, Tic Tac Toe, Eight Puzzle, Missionaries and Cannibals, and variations of the Blocks world. One of the initial achievements of Soar was showing that many different weak methods would naturally arise from the task knowledge that was encoded in it, a property called, the &quot;Universal Weak Method.&quot; 

===Computer configuration===
The first large-scale application of Soar was R1-Soar, a partial reimplementation by Paul Rosenbloom of the R1 (XCON) expert system John McDermott developed for configuring DEC computers. R1-Soar demonstrated the ability of Soar to scale to moderate-size problems, use hierarchical task decomposition and planning, and convert deliberate planning and problem solving to reactive execution through chunking.

===Natural-language understanding===
NL-Soar was a natural-language understanding system developed in Soar by Jill Fain Lehman, Rick Lewis, Nancy Green, Deryle Lonsdale and Greg Nelson. It included capabilities for natural-language comprehension, generation, and dialogue, emphasizing real-time incremental parsing and generation. NL-Soar was used in an experimental version of TacAir-Soar and in NTD-Soar.

===Simulated pilots===
The second large-scale application of Soar involved developing agents for use in training in large-scale distributed simulation. Two major systems for flying U.S. tactical air missions were co-developed at the University of Michigan and Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of University of Southern California. The Michigan system was called TacAir-Soar and flew (in simulation) fixed-wing U. S. military tactical missions (such as close-air support, strikes, CAPs, refueling, and SEAD missions). The ISI system was called RWA-Soar and flew rotary-wing (helicopter) missions. Some of the capabilities incorporated in TacAir-Soar and RWA-Soar were attention, situational awareness and adaptation, real-time planning and dynamic replanning, and complex communication, coordination, and cooperation among combinations of Soar agents and humans. These systems participated in DARPA’s Synthetic Theater of War (STOW-97) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), which at the time was the largest fielding of synthetic agents in a joint battlespace over a 48-hour period, and involved training of active duty personnel. These systems demonstrated the viability of using AI agents for large-scale training.

===STEAM===
One of the important outgrowths of the RWA-Soar project was the development of STEAM by Milind Tambe, a framework for flexible teamwork in which agents maintained models of their teammates using the joint intentions framework by Cohen &amp; Levesque.

===NTD-Soar===
NTD-Soar was a simulation of the NASA Test Director (NTD), the person responsible for coordinating the preparation of the NASA Space Shuttle before launch. It was an integrated cognitive model that incorporated many different complex cognitive capabilities including natural-language processing, attention and visual search, and problem solving in a broad agent model.

===Virtual humans===
Soar has been used to simulate virtual humans supporting face-to-face dialogues and collaboration within a virtual world developed at the Institute of Creative Technology at USC. Virtual humans have integrated capabilities of perception, natural-language understanding, emotions, body control, and action, among others.

===Game AIs and mobile apps===
Game AI agents have been built using Soar for games such as , Quake II, Descent 3, Unreal Tournament, and Minecraft, supporting capabilities such as spatial reasoning, real-time strategy, and opponent anticipation. AI agents have also been created for video games including Infinite Mario which used reinforcement learning, and Frogger II, Space Invaders, and Fast Eddie, which used both reinforcement learning and mental imagery.

Soar can run natively on mobile devices. A mobile application for the game Liar’s Dice has been developed for iOS which runs the Soar architecture directly from the phone as the engine for opponent AIs.

===Robotics===
Many different robotic applications have been built using Soar since the original Robo-Soar was implemented in 1991 for controlling a Puma robot arm. These have ranged from mobile robot control to humanoid service REEM robots, taskable robotic mules and unmanned underwater vehicles.

===Interactive task learning===
A current focus of research and development in the Soar community is Interactive Task Learning (ITL), the automatic learning of new tasks, environment features, behavioral constraints, and other specifications through natural instructor interaction. Research in ITL has been applied to tabletop game playing and multi-room navigation.

===Scheduling===
Early on, Merle-Soar demonstrated how Soar could learn a complex scheduling task modeled after the lead human scheduler in a windshield production plant located near Pittsburgh. Later, a generalized version of Merle-Soar (Dispatcher-Soar) was used to demonstrate a symbolic, constraint propagation approach in learning to improve schedules and to define task-independent knowledge metrics of architecture-specific learning -- knowledge efficiency, knowledge utility, and knowledge effectiveness.

=== Music ===
Melody-Soar demonstrated how the Soar architecture could explain and demonstrate creativity in simple melody generation using hierarchies of problems spaces that parallel the hierarchical structure of melody, allowing unique melodies to be generated from preferences of existing styles (e.g., Bach).

<text>The demographic history of Montenegro can be shown through census results and official documents which mention demographic composition.

== Medieval ==
Duklja, today&#x27;s southern half of Montenegro, under Stefan Vojislav, was inhabited by Serbs.

Various documents listed that the inhabitants of Medieval Doclea or &quot;Zeta&quot; were Serbs, but also minor populations of Latins, Albanians and Vlachs. The language in usage was primarily the Old Slavonic, while in the early stages Latin also had importance and Greek to an extent among the high-class members of the society.

Between the 15th and 17th century, Montenegro had little history on paper. During these years, hundreds of families from Montenegro moved to Rascia which Serbs left to sought refuge in Habsburg Monarchy.

==1614==
Mariano Bolizza of Kotor was a public servant of the Republic of Venice. The main objective of his 1614 report and description of the Sanjak of Shkodra was to provide information on the land routes which could best be utilized by local couriers conveying official correspondence from Venice to Constantinople and back, and to survey the military potential of the territory. He provided a very detailed overview of towns and villages in Montenegro and northern Albania in the early 17th century. The report concluded a religious Orthodox majority, while an Albanian minority was present in the Shkodra region.

==18th century==
The ethnic composition in the 18th century was clear among the Slavs;

*In a letter to Justinian Bert in 1756, Montenegrin chieftains said: &quot;We are of the Orthodox Christian faith and law of the Eastern Church, of the honorable and glorious Slav-Serb kin&quot;.
*Jovan Stefanov Balevic, of the Bratonožić clan, who later became a major in the Russian army, wrote &quot;A brief and objective description of the present state of Montenegro&quot; in St. Petersburg in 1757, where it said: &quot;All inhabitants of Montenegro are ethnically Slav-Serbs and confessionally Greek-Orthodox . As they are incompetent in some skills, because of their lack of school, they are naturally capable, especially with weapons.&quot;; &quot;The number of Montenegrin warriors who live free on the peaks of Montenegro, called by Turks disobedient, does not exceed 5000.&quot;; &quot;There are no artisans and schools in Montenegro except at the Cetinje monastery, within the archbishop&#x27;s residence, where priests learn reading and writing in the Slav-Serb language, which is financed by the archbishop.&quot;; &quot;Montenegrins count among themselves neighbouring Slav-Serbs of different provenience: Kuči, Bratonožići, Donji and Gornji Vasojevići, Piperi, Rovčani, Moračani, Bjelopavlići, who are Serbian Orthodox but Ottoman citizens. They, also, count Roman Catholics: Hoti, Kelmendi, Gruda, Tuzi, Skrivali, Huzi, Maltezi, Kastrati and others who outnumber Montenegrins.&quot;
*Metropolitan Sava called his people, the Montenegrins, by the &quot;Serbian nation&quot; (1766).
*In June 1789, Montenegrin Chieftains, wrote to Russian Empress Katarina II, in the name of the entire Serb Montenegrin community: &quot;We Serbs Montenegrins hope that we shall not be left without help&quot; and &quot;If we could have organization and munition, we would liberate our glorious Serb lands entirely from the Barbarian yoke (Ottoman Empire), together with our armed Serb brothers who aim to attack this enemy from all sides.&quot;

==19th century==
* According to the census conducted in 1863 and 1864, the Principality of Montenegro had a total of 196.230 inhabitants, 99.889 male and 96.339 female.
*Bernard Schwartz estimated in 1882 that the Princedom of Montenegro had 160,000 inhabitants. Although, a more usual estimate is that it was around 230,000 inhabitants.

== 1900 ==

In 1900, according to international sources, the Principality of Montenegro had 311,564 inhabitants. By religion:
* 293,527 Orthodox Christians (94.21%)
* 12,493 Muslims (4.01%)
* 5,544 Roman Catholic Christians (1.78%)

By literacy:
* &quot;77%&quot; illiterate
* 71,528 (&quot;23%&quot;) literate

The Princedom had around 5,000 Albanians and a colony of 800 Romani.

== 1905–1909 ==
In 1905 there were 6,674 emigrants, mostly to the United States.

In 1906 there were 4,346 emigrants, mostly to the United States.

In 1907 it has been estimated that there were around 282,000 inhabitants in Montenegro this year.

== 1909 ==
The 1909 official census was made based on religious affiliation of population of Principality of Montenegro.

Total: 317,856 inhabitants. By religion:
* Eastern Orthodox Christians: &quot;94.38%&quot;
* &quot;others&quot; (mostly Muslims)

== 1913–1914 ==

== 1921 ==
In 1918 Montenegro entered the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1921 it organised a census which recorded the mother tongue and religion. A category called &quot;Serbian or Croatian&quot; was to include all respondents who termed their mother tongue as Serbian. In the counties Andrijevica, Bar, Kolasin, Niksic, Podgorica and Cetinje, which are categorized in official statistics as Montenegro, there were:

Total: 199,227 inhabitants
*Serbo-Croatian: 181,989 (&quot;91.35%&quot;)
*Albanian: 16,838 (&quot;8.45%&quot;)

The counties Berane and Bijelo Polje, which are today in Montenegro, were considered counties of Old Serbia:

*Berane, total 23,864 inhabitants, Serbs 23,561 or (&quot;98.73%&quot;)
*Bijelo Polje, total 26,147 inhabitants, Serbs 26,136 (&quot;99.96%&quot;)

== 1931 ==
The 1931 census was also taken by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia but was later processed in Communist Yugoslavia. Results within today&#x27;s borders of Montenegro were:

== 1948 ==
In 1945, after the World War II, Communist Yugoslavia was formed, and Montenegro was proclaimed as one of its constituent republics. The 1948 and following censa were taken by the Republic of Montenegro.

== 1953 ==

This census witnesses the forming of the Yugoslav nation.

== 1961 ==
The 1961 census results:

In 1968 the Communist Yugoslav government introduced a new category, &quot;ethnic Muslims&quot;.

This census witnessed the forming of the Bosniak nation, but some people still thought of themselves ethnic Muslims, however. Also, there are very few people left who consider themselves Yugoslavs. But the biggest difference compared to the 1991 census is the dramatic increase in self-identification of many inhabitants as Serbs, which was not the case in Socialist Yugoslavia.

<text>Allen Forte (December 23, 1926 – October 16, 2014) was an American music theorist and musicologist. He was Battell Professor Emeritus of the Theory of Music at Yale University and specialized in 20th-century atonal music and music analysis.

==Early life and education==
Forte was born in Portland, Oregon. At the age of ten he appeared &quot;on a [local] radio show as a solo pianist among a bevy of similarly youthful performers,&quot; where he played the music of Cole Porter and others. He was in the US Navy and served in the Pacific Theatre toward the end of World War II.

Afterwards, he relocated to New York City to study music at Columbia University where he received his bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. There, he studied composition with Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky, although his main interests were forming around music theory and analysis.

==Academic career==
In the late 1950s, Forte taught music at various New York institutions: Columbia University Teachers College, Manhattan School of Music, and Mannes College of Music. In fall 1959 he began his long-term appointment at Yale, where he eventually became the Battell Professor of Music (retiring in 2003). He was influential there as both scholar and teacher, and in the latter capacity served as advisor to seventy-two Ph.D. dissertations completed between 1968 and 2002. (Yale did not offer a Ph.D. in theory for the first several years Forte was there.) A list of all his advisees and their dissertation titles appears in David Carson Berry, &quot;The Twin Legacies of a Scholar-Teacher: The Publications and Dissertation Advisees of Allen Forte,&quot; Gamut 2/1 (2009), 197-222. The list is ordered chronologically by submission, and each advisee is given an &quot;FA&quot; number to denote his or her ordering among the advisees. (&quot;FA&quot; stands for &quot;Forte Advisee,&quot; and is also a retrograde of Allen Forte&#x27;s initials.)

Forte taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1967–68 on integrating music theory with computer systems. He was also a visiting music professor at Harvard University in 2008

==Publications==
Forte is well known for his book &quot;The Structure of Atonal Music&quot; (1973), which traces many of its roots to an article of a decade earlier: &quot;A Theory of Set-Complexes for Music&quot; (1964). In these works, he &quot;applied set-theoretic principles to the analysis of unordered collections of pitch classes, called pitch-class sets (pc sets). [...] The basic goal of Forte&#x27;s theory was to define the various relationships that existed among the relevant sets of a work, so that contextual coherence could be demonstrated.&quot; Although the methodology derived from Forte&#x27;s work &quot;has had its detractors ... textbooks on post-tonal analysis now routinely teach it (to varying degrees).&quot;

Forte published analyses of the works of Webern and Berg and wrote about Schenkerian analysis and music of the Great American Songbook. A complete, annotated bibliography of his publications appears in the previously cited article, Berry, &quot;The Twin Legacies of a Scholar-Teacher.&quot; Excluding items for which Forte was only an editor, it lists ten books, sixty-three articles, and thirty-six other types publications, from 1955 through early 2009.

Forte was also the editor of the &quot;Journal of Music Theory&quot; during an important period in its development, from volume 4/2 (1960) through 11/1 (1967). His involvement with the journal, including many biographical details, is addressed in David Carson Berry, &quot;Journal of Music Theory under Allen Forte&#x27;s Editorship,&quot; &quot;Journal of Music Theory&quot; 50/1 (2006): 7-23.

==Honors and awards==
He has been honored by two Festschriften (homage volumes). The first, in commemoration of his seventieth birthday, was published in 1997 and edited by his former students James M. Baker, David W. Beach, and Jonathan W. Bernard (FA12, FA6, and FA11, according to Berry&#x27;s list). It was titled &quot;Music Theory in Concept and Practice&quot; (a title derived from Forte&#x27;s 1962 undergraduate textbook, &quot;Tonal Harmony in Concept and Practice&quot;). The second was serialized in five installments of &quot;Gamut: The Journal of the Music Theory Society of the Mid-Atlantic&quot;, between 2009 and 2013. It was edited by Forte&#x27;s former student David Carson Berry (FA72) and was titled &quot;A Music-Theoretical Matrix: Essays in Honor of Allen Forte&quot; (a title derived from Forte&#x27;s 1961 monograph, &quot;A Compositional Matrix&quot;). It included twenty-two articles by Forte&#x27;s former doctoral advisees, and three special features: a previously unpublished article by Forte, on Gershwin songs; a collection of tributes and reminiscences from forty-two of his former advisees; and an annotated register of his publications and advisees.

==Personal life==
Forte was married to Herta Lynd Waitzfelder Sharland (1915–2000) and also to the French-born pianist Madeleine (Hsu) Forte, emerita professor of piano at Boise State University.

<text>Ieremia Tienang Tabai (born 16 December 1949) is an I-Kiribati politician who served as the first president of Kiribati from 1979 to 1991. He previously served in the equivalent role, chief minister, under the colonial government from 1978 to 1979. Tabai returned to the House of Assembly in 1998 and represented Nonouti as of his re-election in 2024.

After attending university in New Zealand, Tabai worked in the Ministry of Finance for a year before deciding to enter politics. He was elected to the House of Assembly in 1974 and became the leader of the opposition. Tabai defeated the incumbent Naboua Ratieta to become chief minister in the 1978 election, effectively putting him in charge of independence negotiations, and he became the president of Kiribati upon independence in 1979. He was elected to another term as president in 1982. His term ended abruptly after he tied an unsuccessful bill to a motion of no confidence, but he retained the presidency in the resulting 1983 election. In the early years of his presidency, Tabai made national self-sufficiency central to his agenda.

Tabai signed a fishing agreement with the Soviet Union in 1985, triggering both domestic and international protest. He ran for re-election in 1987, but opposition member Harry Tong filed a legal challenge, saying that Tabai&#x27;s elections in 1978, 1982, and 1983 meant that Tabai was term-limited. It was determined that the 1978 election was for a colonial position and it did not count against his term limit. Tabai then won re-election. He was term-limited in 1991, so he successfully campaigned for his vice-president Teatao Teannaki to be the next president.

Tabai became Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum in 1992, holding the office until 1998. He then returned to parliamentary politics. Tabai founded two media outlets over the next few years: the &quot;Newstar&quot; newspaper, which was the country&#x27;s first independently-owned outlet, and a radio station. As an assemblyman, he has opposed Kiribati&#x27;s relations with China and spoken in favour of smaller family sizes to limit the effects of overpopulation and climate change.

== Education ==
Ieremia Tienang Tabai was born in Nonouti on 16 December 1949. He began attending King George V High School in Tarawa when was 11 years old, and he was chosen for a scholarship sponsored by the government of New Zealand to continue his schooling in the country. The change was difficult for him, where he was separated from his family and poorer than the other students, but he credited the experience with teaching him frugality. Tabai attended college at St Andrew&#x27;s College, Christchurch from 1967 to 1968. Tabai watched the politicians of New Zealand while he was in the country, with Prime Minister Norman Kirk in particular having a strong influence on him. He graduated in 1972 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce and administration.

Tabai returned home to the Gilbert Islands in 1973. He was one of the only people in the country to have a degree in Tarawa, allowing him to get a job at the Ministry of Finance. He worked there for one year before switching to politics. He married a woman from the Ellice Islands, Meleangi Tabai.

== Early political career ==
Beginning his political career, Tabai adopted the politics of Reuben Uatioa. Tabai was elected to represent Nonouti in the House of Assembly during the 1974 general election, and he became the leader of the opposition the following year. For this election, Tabai and his allies called themselves the Democratic Labour Party. He became a strong critic of Naboua Ratieta&#x27;s government, particularly Ratieta&#x27;s proposal to create a defence force. The voters saw Ratieta as biased toward northern, Catholic, anti-union demographics, so Tabai&#x27;s southern, Protestant heritage contrasted him with Ratieta. He presented himself as a common man and an advocate for the outer islands.

Part of Tabai&#x27;s image was based on his rejection of elitism and protocol; the meetings he held on the outer islands were informal, he often rode the bus, and he was known to ride his bicycle to the shops without a shirt or shoes. Tabai was one of several Pacific leaders of his generation to be shaped by the Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific movement. His habit of taking his son fishing and his willingness to harvest his own coconut sap endeared him to voters.

Tabai led an active campaign against the Ratieta administration, critical of its focus on urbanization at the expense of the outer islands and its decision to create a defence force. He attracted support through his performances in broadcasts of parliamentary debates and by visiting many of the outer islands. The primary theme of Tabai&#x27;s campaign was that the Ratieta administration was out of touch with the needs of the outer islands and their people. Through his campaigning, he created the impression that Ratieta was ignoring the nation&#x27;s self-governance and represented a continuation of colonial leadership. After the election, Tabai felt that local issues determined elections more than the national issues that he considered only relevant to South Tarawa.

When the House of Assembly approved a constitutional amendment to establish a popularly elected chief minister, Tabai and three of his allies competed with Ratieta, preventing Ratieta from qualifying for the four-candidate ballot. Accepting that any of them would make an agreeable chief minister, Tabai and Roniti Teiwaki agreed not to campaign around the nation as they were already well-known relative to the other two.

The election for chief minister was held on 17 March 1978, and Tabai won with 55.6% of the vote. Like all of the candidates, he received strong support from the district he represented. The more central location of his district mitigated North–South polarisation, and he received one third of the Catholic vote despite being a Protestant in a religiously divided country. He also received the largest share of the union vote. The youngest candidate of the election, Tabai was only 27 years old when he took the office; although elder status was a significant qualifier in Kiribati, voters prioritised his understanding of government. Tabai later said that his university education, a rarity among the Gilbertese people at the time, gave him an electoral advantage.

== Chief minister ==
Tabai carefully balanced his ministry picks when organising his government, ensuring that there was representation for the north, central, and south regions, for both Catholics and Protestants, and for unions. He chose Teannaki as his Vice-President. As chief minister, Tabai was responsible for negotiating the independence of Kiribati. He travelled to London and Washington D.C. in June 1978, leading a delegation that included two ministers, two expatriate civil servants, and two advisers from the Commonwealth Secretariat. Here he negotiated arrangements for financial support from the United Kingdom as the resource that made up the majority of Kiribati&#x27;s economy, phosphate, was depleted. Also discussed were access to the colonial government&#x27;s reserve funds, the legal status of Banaba, and American claims in the region. Tabai believed that Australia and New Zealand would be necessary allies after independence, and he criticized them for giving disproportionate aid to the Pacific nations that they had previously held as territories.

As negotiations dragged into October and November, Tabai declared that he would not waver in his opposition to an autonomous Banaba, saying that the Gilbert Islands had the &quot;absolute right to proceed to independence with its territorial integrity intact&quot;. He argued this point during the constitutional convention at Marlborough House in November and December. Although the constitution was based on the Westminster system of the United Kingdom, it brought changes to the system that Tabai credited with maintaining the country&#x27;s stability over the following years, such as an executive president with term limits.

Tabai agreed to an international commission in May 1979 in Suva to address the new constitution and the Banaba issue, further delaying independence. Kiribati achieved independence on 12 July 1979, and Tabai&#x27;s position of chief minister was renamed president of Kiribati. The large independence celebration was Tabai&#x27;s first test as the new president, requiring that he manage the many influential figures who visited over the next two days. By this time, he had two children.

== Presidency ==
=== 1979–1982 ===
With an independent nation, Tabai considered it essential that his government could inform the people how the government worked and to get them accustomed to democracy. He was faced with managing an incredibly poor economy between several distant islands, dependent on a foreign nation for its funding. Financial independence became a core ideal motivating the policies of Tabai&#x27;s government. He enacted a loose policy of austerity with limited spending and moderate privatisation, though he did not enact any spending cuts or tax reform.

Kiribati moved toward a subsistence economy, and it cut funding for public services which included the operation of only a basic primary health care system. Tabai opposed the development of a tourism industry, fearing that the small island nation could be overwhelmed by a surge of wealthy tourists. He instead proposed that they wait &quot;50 or 100 years before talking about such a subject&quot;.

Tabai&#x27;s efforts to promote development and quality of life in the outer islands through the construction of schools and government administration proved unsuccessful. Constitutional law professors Yash Ghai and Jill Cottrell described Tabai&#x27;s presidency as &quot;quieter&quot; than the neighbouring Pacific leaders who dominated their nations&#x27; politics. While president, Tabai continued a practice of climbing a 10-metre-tall coconut tree twice each day to fetch coconut milk, which he said was more economical than buying soft drinks. He considered this a possible career should he fail to be re-elected. Tabai attended the 1979 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka shortly after becoming president, where he was the youngest world leader to ever attend a Commonwealth meeting. As president, the United Kingdom granted him an honorary Order of St Michael and St George.

One of the key conflicts of Tabai&#x27;s presidency began in 1980 when the general workers union Botaki ni Karikirakean Aroia Taan Makuri led a strike. It turned violent, and hundreds of workers lost their jobs. One assemblyman, Bwebwentaratai Benson, passed a motion condemning how Tabai&#x27;s government handled the strike. This motion was interpreted as a motion of no confidence in Tabai&#x27;s government, but it failed with 11 votes in favour of the motion and 22 votes against it. The 1982 parliamentary election in March and April became a competition between Tabai&#x27;s government and the unionists. Of Tabai&#x27;s nineteen allies in parliament, seven lost their re-election campaigns.

The 1982 presidential election took place on 4 May. Tabai&#x27;s allies in the House of Assembly gained enough support from independent members to put Tabai and former Vice-President Teatao Teannaki on the ballot, while the unionists aligned with Ratieta&#x27;s allies to nominate him along with unionist Etera Teangana. Taibai&#x27;s broad popularity among voters made him a clear favourite to win, and he was re-elected with 48.7% of the vote. His ally Teannaki received 28.5%, further indicating popular support for Tabai&#x27;s government.

=== 1982–1983 ===
Tabai went into his next term without a majority in the House of Assembly. His government introduced a bill in December to correct a salary discrepancy for six statutory officers, but the opposition challenged it as a means to attack Tabai politically. Tabai responded by tying it to confidence in his government and putting it to a new vote. Tabai&#x27;s slim majority failed him, and the bill was defeated with 15 voting in support and 20 voting in opposition, triggering new elections. While his government was dissolved, Tabai&#x27;s role as head of government was taken over by the Council of State, which included the Speaker of the House, the chairman of the Public Service Commission, and the Chief Justice.

The 1983 parliamentary election was held on 12 and 19 January 1983. and it brought Tabai a net increase of two supporters in the House of Assembly, bringing him a majority with 19 of 32 assemblymen. Tabai and Teannaki were again nominated for the ballot in the subsequent presidential election, this time with Harry Tong and Tewareka Tentoa. Tabai disliked the political conflict surrounding him, and it is rumoured that he considered not running until he was talked into seeking re-election. He won re-election with 49.6% of the vote. Teiwaki criticised Tabai for only appointing allies to his new cabinet instead of working with the opposition.

=== 1983–1987 ===
Tabai was chancellor of the University of the South Pacific from 1983 to 1986.

Tabai incited condemnation from Western nations and neighbouring island nations in March 1985, when he began negotiations with the Soviet Union over fishing rights. In exchange for US$1.5 million, he gave Soviet trawlers access to Kiribati&#x27;s fishing zones for one year. Tabai justified the decision as a means for Kiribati to be self-sufficient and forgo British financial support, saying that fish were the only major resource the nation had. He rebutted fears that this was the first step in building a Soviet land base in Kiribati. The domestic political dispute fell along religious lines, as the Bishop of Tarawa condemned the agreement and rallied Catholics against it as a deal with a godless nation, while Protestants generally supported it. By August, the fishing agreement was signed and the domestic backlash intensified. After Tabai rejected proposals for a referendum, the opposition presented a motion of no confidence, but it failed with 15 supporting and 19 opposing. Tabai signed the agreement in October 1985. Once it was in place, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States began pouring money into the region through financial support and rival fishing rights agreements. The Soviet agreement was not renewed, as Kiribati and the Soviet Union were unable to agree on terms.

Tong filed a legal challenge against Tabai as the 1987 presidential election approached, arguing that Tabai&#x27;s tenure as chief minister counted as a presidential term, which would mean he had reached his three-term limit and would be ineligible to run again. The High Court ruled that Tong had no legal standing to request an injunction against Tabai, as candidates had not yet been nominated for the ballot and Tong was therefore not an electoral opponent of Tabai. In the 1987 parliamentary election, Tabai was re-elected in the first round of voting. Tong filed a new injunction after they were both nominated on the presidential ballot, but he dropped out before the ruling, so the court found that he again lacked standing against Tabai. Tabai was re-elected as president with 50.1% of the vote, but the opposition gained a larger share than in previous elections, in part because of lingering resentment among voters over the Soviet fishing agreement.

=== 1987–1991 ===
Without a majority in the House of Assembly, Tabai depended on an alliance with the independent assemblymen. Finding that he did not have enough support to effectively control parliament, he removed three of his ministers in July 1987 and replaced them with former supporters who had defected to the Liberal Party. Tabai received an honorary doctorate of law from his alma mater Victoria University while visiting in 1990.

Tabai successfully ran for re-election to his seat in the House of Assembly in the 1991 parliamentary election, but he was term-limited for the presidency and not eligible to run for re-election in the 1991 presidential election. Instead, he leveraged his popularity to campaign for his allies, who labelled themselves the National Progressive Party. Teannaki was put on the ballot as the National Progressive Party&#x27;s preferred candidate, and he campaigned on a continuation of Tabai&#x27;s policies. Teannaki succeeded Tabai after winning 46.3% of the vote, demonstrating continued support for Tabai&#x27;s government. In a 2004 interview, Tabai admitted that he was relieved when his time as president ended.

== Post-presidency ==
=== Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum ===
Tabai was selected as the chancellor of the University of the South Pacific in 1991, and rumours spread that he was seeking the position of Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum. He received the position, becoming Secretary-General on 31 January 1992. Going into the new role, he supported consolidation for the Pacific Islands Forum in contrast to the expansion of the previous decade. Tabai received the highest honour of Kiribati, the Kiribati Grand Order, the same year.

In his first year as Secretary-General, Tabai became the first representative of the Pacific Islands Forum to be invited to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. He was frustrated by what he felt was neglect from larger nations on the Pacific Rim, saying they regarded the Pacific as &quot;nothing but a vast empty space&quot; that obstructed their interactions with one another. Tabai travelled across the Pacific island nations as Secretary-General, operating under the philosophy that the Secretariat needed to hear the concerns of member nations, and he travelled to other parts of the world to stay attuned to global politics. He was in favour of expanding foreign trade during his tenure, particularly with Asian nations.

Tabai&#x27;s selection for reappointment as Secretary-General in 1994 drew backlash from the Fijian government, which felt that its own candidate Filipe Bole had been sidelined. It alleged that Tabai failed to apply for reappointment, giving Fiji a false impression that it could submit a candidate. In May 1996, he was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia for &quot;service to Australian-Pacific Islands countries relations, particularly as Secretary-General to the South Pacific Forum&quot;. Tabai&#x27;s tenure as Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum ended in 1998. Given the difficulty of getting a job in Kiribati, he decided to return to politics as a member of the House of Assembly.

=== Return to the House of Assembly ===
Tabai planned to start a radio station so that the government would not have a monopoly on news, hoping to have it running before the 1998 election. With the former programme manager of Radio Kiribati, Atiera Tetoa, Tabai co-founded Newair FM 101. After consulting with the government People&#x27;s Lawyer and confirming that a license was not necessary, they aired a test broadcast with music. The government ordered that it cease operations shortly after, and the police opened an investigation for broadcasting without a license and for constructing a radio antennae without authorisation. The government refused them when they requested a license, and they received fines of $A35 each on 8 December 1999 after pleading guilty to importing and operating radio equipment without authorisation. While he was working on creating a radio station, Tabai founded a newspaper, the &quot;Newstar&quot;, with his brother and Siau Smith, an I-Kiribati woman from Melbourne. This was the first independently owned media outlet in Kiribati. He believed that independent media was important, arguing that government-controlled media would never be critical of the government. As of 2001, it cost 60 cents and had a circulation of 1,700. Tabai received a radio license in 2002 after he took the government to court.

As a member of the opposition, Tabai was aligned with the Boutokaan te Koaua party. Tabai has spoken in favour of including women in politics. He said that the nation should encourage smaller families of just two or three children in 2014 to address the nation&#x27;s growing population, arguing that it was a necessary measure to prevent unemployment and to better serve women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s health. He later said that encouraging smaller families would help manage challenges to liveability caused by climate change. Along with the rest of the opposition, Tabai opposed the shift of Kiribati&#x27;s foreign policy to favour of China in 2019, arguing that Taneti Maamau only made the decision to help his government win the next election. Tabai opposed the country&#x27;s withdrawal from the Pacific Islands Forum in 2022, criticising the government for making the decision without consulting members of parliament or the public. He protested the deportation of the Australian-born judge David Lambourne in 2024, alleging that it was intended to punish Lambourne&#x27;s wife, opposition leader Tessie Eria Lambourne.

<doc id="729760" wikidata="Q2520855" url="?curid=729760" title="List of United States Navy ratings">
<text>United States Navy ratings are general enlisted occupations used by the U.S. Navy since the 18th century, which denote the specific skills and abilities of the sailor. Each naval rating has its own specialty badge, which is worn on the left sleeve of dress uniforms of enlisted personnel. U.S. naval ratings are the equivalent of military occupational specialty codes (MOS codes) used by the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps, the ratings system used by the United States Coast Guard, and Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) used by the United States Air Force and United States Space Force.

Ratings should not be confused with &quot;rates&quot;, which are used to identify personnel of specific a rating and pay grade. For example, if a sailor has the pay-grade of E-5 (petty officer second class) and the rating of boatswain&#x27;s mate, then combining the two—boatswain&#x27;s mate second class (BM2)—defines both pay grade and rating in formal address or epistolary salutation. Thus, boatswain&#x27;s mate second class (BM2) would be that sailor&#x27;s rate.

Sailors from pay-grades E-1 to E-3 that have no rates, are considered to be in apprenticeships or training for a rating, thus the slang term &quot;undes&quot; (Pronounced UN-DEZ) (un-designated) when referring to them as a group. A Sailor actively working toward a specific rating is referred to as &quot;striking for a rating&quot; and is called a &quot;striker&quot;. E-1 to E-3 are divided into five general occupational fields (airman, constructionman, fireman, hospitalman, or seaman) based on their rate. For example, an AD (Aviation Machinist&#x27;s Mate) E-3 would be referred to as an Airman, an E-2 as an Airman Apprentice, and E-1 as an Airman Recruit. The paper designation for these is ADAN, ADAA, and ADAR respectively, SN, SA, and SR for sea-going rates, FN, FA, FR for engineering and damage control rates, CN, CA, CR for Seabee, naval construction units, and HN, HA, and HR for Corpsman. 

Naval Officers: Although naval officers do specialize in various fields their occupations are classified according to designators for both officers of the line (i.e., line officers) and those of the professional staff corps.

==History==
The U.S. Navy&#x27;s enlisted occupational system was a product of more than 200 years of Naval evolution. The Navy of the United Colonies of the 1775 era offered only a few different jobs above the level of ordinary seaman. These included Boatswain&#x27;s mate, Quartermaster, and Gunner&#x27;s Mate. These were titles of the jobs that individuals were actually performing and became the basis for petty officers and ratings. During this time, ship crews were taken from civilian life and enlisted for only one cruise, thus making the job at hand the primary consideration, rather than career possibilities. It was not until 1841 that distinguishing marks for a rating were prescribed in the Regulations of the Secretary of the Navy, but specialty marks were not added to enlisted men&#x27;s uniforms until 1866. The marks consisted of the tools or instruments used in each rating&#x27;s specific duty. The Master-at-Arms, the police officer of a ship, wore the star of authority and the Gunner&#x27;s Mate wore two crossed cannons. Currently, all specialty marks for new ratings are approved by the Permanent Naval Uniform Board, which is a division of the Bureau of Naval Personnel.

As the U.S. Navy&#x27;s rating system changed so did the U.S. Navy. The first steamship, mine, radar, torpedo, aircraft carrier, and many other &quot;firsts&quot; all established a new era in the Navy, and each directly impacted the enlisted occupation structure. During World War II, the U.S. Navy also briefly maintained a rating of &quot;Specialist&quot;, similar to the rank in the U.S. Army. The rating of &quot;Specialist&quot; was discontinued in 1948.

Since the establishment of the rating system, the U.S. Navy enlisted rating structure played a key role in career development, serving as a basis for training, detailing, advancement, and simply keeping tabs on several hundred thousand sailors.

===Temporary end of ratings===
Beginning in June 2016, at the express direction of then Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, the then Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, Michael D. Stevens, oversaw a review of the Navy&#x27;s existing enlisted rating system. After Stevens&#x27;s retirement, a group of senior enlisted leaders came to the conclusion that the Navy needed to replace its current enlisted system and announced the changes on 29 September 2016 with the release of NAVADMIN 218/16. The changes would have eliminated ratings in favor of the generic titles of &quot;Seaman&quot; (E-1 to E-3) or &quot;Petty Officer&quot; (E-4 to E-6) and accompanying Navy Occupational Specialty (NOS) codes. The Navy stated that the decision was motivated by a desire to assist former sailors in obtaining employment after their naval service by making naval job titles more congruent with their civilian counterparts, as well as to make said titles more unisex.

However, the &quot;overwhelmingly unpopular decision&quot; was not well received as many sailors had grown accustomed and attached to their ratings, viewing them as a source of morale. Further, they had no desire to be unisex. In response to widespread criticism, ratings were reinstated with immediate effect on 20 December 2016. Former CNO Admiral John Richardson indicated he still intended to change the personnel system in the future; however, he stepped down in 2019, and there has since been no change.

==Rating structure==
The pay grades E-4 (petty officer third class) through E-9 (master chief petty officer) fall within the rating structure. It is further broken down into four types of ratings and classifications:

* 57 General ratings: consisting of broad occupational fields such as boatswain&#x27;s mate, electronics technician, machinist&#x27;s mate, fire controlman, etc.
* 37 Service ratings: which are made up of sub categories of general ratings that require further specialized training and qualifications. Service ratings are established, changed, or removed depending on service requirements and changes in the way personnel are managed.
* 4 Compression ratings (AF, AV, CU, CB): Identify the combining of several general or service ratings at paygrade E-9 (E-8 for CU) to form broader career fields when the occupational content is similar. These ratings exist only at the E-8/E-9 levels and are not identified previously as a general or service rating.
* Navy Enlisted Classifications (NEC), which are alphanumeric codes attached to a specific rating and are frequently used to indicate specialized qualifications and Emergency ratings.
* Emergency ratings, which are specific ratings that can be established in time of war and are distinguished by a letter of the alphabet enclosed in a diamond.

Paygrades E-1 through E-3 can also have a rating abbreviation preceding their paygrade symbol if they are graduates of Class &quot;A&quot; schools; have received the rating designation in a previous enlistment; are assigned to a billet in that specialty as a &quot;striker&quot;; have passed an advancement examination and not been selected for advancement for reasons of numeric limitations on advancements; or have been reduced in rate because of punishment. Examples: BMSR is a boatswain&#x27;s mate seaman recruit (paygrade E-1); MMFA is a machinist&#x27;s mate fireman apprentice (paygrade E-2); EOCN is an equipment operator constructionman (paygrade E-3). HN is hospitalman, which is a hospital corpsman with the paygrade of E-3.

==Aviation ratings==
=== Aviation ratings notes ===
I: ABE, ABF, and ABH combine at paygrade E-9 to the rate of &quot;Master Chief Aviation Boatswain&#x27;s Mate (ABCM)&quot;.
II: AM and AME combine at paygrade E-8 to the rate of &quot;Senior Chief Structural Mechanic (AMCS)&quot;; AM, AME, and AD combine at paygrade E-9 to the rate of &quot;Master Chief Aircraft Maintenanceman (AFCM)&quot;.
III: AE and AT combine at paygrade E-9 to the rate of &quot;Master Chief Avionics Technician (AVCM)&quot;.
IV: In 2008, the AW rating merged with all other aircrew NECs and changed their title from aviation warfare system operators to naval aircrewman.

==Construction ratings==
=== Construction ratings notes ===
I: BU, EA, and SW combine, as follows:
*at paygrade E-8 to the rating of &quot;Senior Chief Constructionman (CUCS)&quot;
*before NAVADMIN 054/21; at paygrade E-9 to the rating of &quot;Master Chief Constructionman (CUCM)&quot;.
II: Before NAVADMIN 054/21; CE and UT combine at paygrade E-9 to the rating of &quot;Master chief Utilitiesman (UCCM)&quot;.
III: Before NAVADMIN 054/21; CM and EO combine at paygrade E-9 to the rating of &quot;Master chief equipmentman (EQCM)&quot;.

IV: Per NAVADMIN 054/21: Constructionman Master Chief (CUCM), Equipmentman Master Chief (EQCM) and Utilities Constructionman Master Chief (UCCM) [E-9 paygrades] rating names, all change to Seabee Master Chief (CBCM). The change applies to Active-Duty and Selected Reserve Sailors. Those Master Chiefs already in CUCM, EQCM or UCCM ratings were to be automatically converted to CBCM on 15 March 2021, but current source ratings badges were to be retained.

== Medical rating ==
==General ratings==
=== Administration et cetera notes ===
I: Cryptologic Technician now includes former rating of electronic warfare technician (EW).
II: Information Systems Technician now includes former rating of cryptologic technician – communications (CTO).
III: Quartermaster QM now exists as electronics technician (navigation) ETV on submarines.
IIII: LN and RP are also issued to sailors attached to Marine units.

==Engineering and hull ratings==
=== Engineering and hull ratings notes ===
Prior to March 2014, IC and EM combine at paygrade E-9 to the rating of Master Chief Electrician&#x27;s Mate (EMCM). After that time, the IC Rating was moved to the Seaman ratings group from the Fireman ratings group. Now, upon selection to E9, ICCS is promoted to ICCM.

<doc id="729761" wikidata="Q1162997" url="?curid=729761" title="Fintan mac Bóchra">
<text>In Irish mythology Fintan mac Bóchra (modern spelling: Fionntán), known as &quot;the Wise&quot;, was a seer who accompanied Noah&#x27;s granddaughter Cessair to Ireland before the deluge. Bóchra may be his mother, or may be a poetic reference to the sea.

He was one of only three men in the expedition, along with fifty women, so he, Cessair&#x27;s father Bith, and the pilot, Ladra, had sixteen wives each. Fintan&#x27;s wives are named: Cessair, Lot, Luam, Mall, Mar, Froechar, Femar, Faible, Foroll, Cipir, Torrian, Tamall, Tam, Abba, Alla, Baichne, and Sille. He married Ebliu later. His only son was Illann.

His wives and children were drowned when the flood arrived but he survived in the form of a salmon, remaining a year under the waters in a cave called Fintan&#x27;s Grave. He then turned into an eagle and then a hawk then back to human form. He lived for 5500 years after the Deluge, becoming an advisor to the kings of Ireland. In this capacity he gave advice to the Fir Bolg king Eochaid mac Eirc when the Tuatha Dé Danann invaded, and fought in the first Battle of Magh Tuiredh.

He survived into the time of Fionn mac Cumhail, becoming the repository of all knowledge of Ireland and all history along with a magical hawk who was born at the same time as him. They meet at the end of their lives and recount their stories to each other. They decide to leave the mortal realm together sometime in the 5th century, after Ireland was converted to Christianity. 

Due to his ability to shape-shift into a salmon and his honorific title as &quot;The Wise&quot;, Fintan mac Bóchra is sometimes confused with a similarly named animal figured in Irish mythology more commonly known and referred to as the Salmon of Knowledge. On the other hand people often forget or remain unaware of the significance to the Fionn mac Cumhail legend, and effectively tell only half the story. There is a school of thought that the relation of Fionn mac Cumhail with the Salmon was a much later alternative to link him with the original knowledge of Ireland&#x27;s first populations.

<text>Rule-set-based access control (RSBAC) is an open source access control framework for current Linux kernels, which has been in stable production use since January 2000 (version 1.0.9a).

==Features==
* Free open source GNU General Public License (GPL) Linux kernel security extension
* Independent of governments and big companies
* Several well-known and new security models, e.g. mandatory access control (MAC), access control list (ACL), and role compatibility (RC)
* On-access virus scanning with Dazuko interface
* Detailed control over individual user and program network accesses
* Fully access controlled kernel level user management
* Any combination of security models possible
* Easily extensible: write your own model for runtime registration
* Support for latest kernels
* Stable for production use
* Easily portable to other operating systems

The RSBAC system architecture has been derived and extended from the Generalized Framework for Access Control (GFAC) by Marshall Abrams and Leonard La Padula.

RSBAC means &quot;ruleset based access control&quot; and is also a role-based access control (RBAC) solution. The two acronyms can cause confusion.

In his essay &quot;Rule Set Modeling of a Trusted Computer System&quot;, Leonard LaPadula describes how the Generalized Framework for Access Control (GFAC) approach could be implemented in the UNIX System V operating system. He introduced the clear separation between Access Enforcement Facility (AEF), Access Decision Facility (ADF) with Access Control Rules (ACR), and Access Control Information (ACI).

The AEF as part of the system call function calls the ADF, which uses ACI and the rules to return a decision and a set of new ACI attribute values. The decision is then enforced by the AEF, which also sets the new attribute values and, in case of allowed access, provides object access to the subject.

This structure requires all security relevant system calls to be extended by AEF interception, and it needs a well-defined interface between AEF and ADF. For better modeling, a set of request types was used in which all system call functionalities were to be expressed. The general structure of the GFAC has also been included in the ISO standard 10181-3 Security frameworks for open systems: Access control framework and into The Open Group standard Authorization (AZN) API.

The first RSBAC prototype followed La Padula&#x27;s suggestions and implemented some access control policies briefly described there, namely mandatory access control (MAC), functional control (FC) and Security Information Modification (SIM), as well as the Privacy Model by Simone Fischer-Hübner.

Many aspects of the system have changed a lot since then, e.g. the current framework supports more object types, includes generic list management and network access control, contains several additional security models, and supports runtime registration of decision modules and system calls for their administration.

== RSBAC and other solutions ==
RSBAC is very close to Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), as they share a lot more in their design than other access controls such as AppArmor.

However, RSBAC brings its own hooking code instead of relying on the Linux Security Module (LSM). Due to this, RSBAC is technically a replacement for LSM itself, and implement modules that are similar to SELinux, but with additional functionality.

The RSBAC framework incorporates complete object status and has a full knowledge of the kernel state when making decisions, making it more flexible and reliable. However, this comes at the cost of slightly higher overhead in the framework itself. Although SELinux- and RSBAC-enabled systems have similar impact on performance, LSM impact alone is negligible compared to the RSBAC framework alone.

For this reason, LSM has been selected as default and unique security-hooking mechanism in the Linux kernel, RSBAC coming as a separate patch only.

== History ==
RSBAC was the first Linux role-based access control (RBAC) and mandatory access control (MAC) patch.

<text>Montenegrin ( ; , ) is a normative variety of the Serbo-Croatian language mainly used by Montenegrins and is the official language of Montenegro. Montenegrin is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian, more specifically on Eastern Herzegovinian, which is also the basis of Standard Croatian, Serbian, and Bosnian.

Montenegro&#x27;s language has historically and traditionally been called either Serbian or Montenegrin. The idea of a standardized Montenegrin standard language separate from Serbian appeared in the 1990s during the breakup of Yugoslavia through proponents of Montenegrin independence from Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegrin became the official language of Montenegro with the ratification and proclamation of a new constitution in October 2007.

==History==

The beginnings of Montenegrin literacy date back to 9th century, during the Duklja period, with the establishment of numerous monasteries in the coastal region. While traces of Latin and Greek literacy from the Duklja period are partially preserved, there is only indirect evidence of literacy in the Slavic language. The use of Glagolitic script in Duklja was influenced by the strong center of Slavic literacy in Ohrid, although some argue that Slavic literature in Duklja was written in Latin script. Literary activity flourished around Lake Skadar during this period, with the Monastery of Prečista Krajinska as a significant center.

The Zeta period begins with the fall of Duklja to Serbian rule and extends through the rule of the Balšić and Crnojević families. While there is no consensus on the dating of Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts in present-day Montenegro, it is established that Old Church Slavonic and Cyrillic became dominant during the Zeta period, replacing Glagolitic script.

In Zeta was established a printing press by Đurađ Crnojević, starting in Obod and later moving to Cetinje. This press produced five incunabula, making Montenegro one of the four Slavic nations with incunabula in their language. During this period there was a development of the Zetan (Montenegrin) redaction of Old Church Slavonic, exemplified by the Miroslavljevo Gospel from the 12th century, written in Kotor. This redaction adapted Old Church Slavonic to the local language of medieval Zeta, influencing Bosnian and Serbian redactions. Despite being erroneously labeled as Zeta-Hum redaction, it originated in Zeta and then spread to Hum.

The period of written language spans from the late 15th to the 18th century. During this time, written language represents the written realization of the local spoken language. In new socio-historical circumstances in Montenegro, there was a gradual shift towards the reintegration of the Montenegrin language with a popular basis. However, Old Church Slavonic continued to be used in the Orthodox Church for a long time. In this phase, Old Church Slavonic books and Cyrillic script dominated. Yet, in the coastal region, the influence of the Montenegrin type of Old Church Slavonic had little impact on the literature of the period, where Latin and Italian language prevailed.

The written language in secular use continued to follow the development of the Montenegrin spoken language, progressively shedding Church Slavonic elements as time passed. The most significant writers during the period of written language emerged in the late Baroque period - Andrija Zmajević in the coastal part Bay of Kotor and Danilo Petrović Njegoš in the continental part Cetinje. Both wrote in the Montenegrin vernacular.

From the second half of the 18th century, strengthened by the state and church organization, conditions were created for the establishment of the uncodified Montenegrin literary language as a means of common communication across the territory under the jurisdiction of the state and church. Even before the birth of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, Ivan-Antun Nenadić from Perast advocated for the phonetic orthographic principle, emphasizing that writing should reflect how people speak and pronounce. This rule was applied early in Montenegrin literature, making it unsurprising that Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s linguistic reforms were later accepted without significant issues. In the period of the uncodified Montenegrin literary language, three styles can be observed: literary, business, and scientific, all formed in the process of spontaneous Montenegrin linguistic standardization. Montenegrin literature, both linguistically and thematically, originated from everyday life. In the period in question, the highest achievement of such literary language is seen in the letters of Petar I Petrović-Njegoš.

As a result of Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s linguistic reform, during the transitional period of the Montenegrin language (from the 1830s to World War I), significant changes occurred, and some typical Montenegrin linguistic features were officially abolished. Throughout this period, the language in Montenegro was officially referred to as Serbian, and the assimilation of the Montenegrin language toward the general štokavian Karadžić model was primarily implemented through textbooks and external teaching staff that wholeheartedly followed the principles of Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s linguistic reform.

Vuk&#x27;s principle of introducing the vernacular into literature encountered little opposition in Montenegro, as it was already present there before Vuk. However, the complete acceptance of all aspects of this reform did not proceed smoothly, leading to divisions among Montenegrin cultural figures. In lengthy debates, Jovan Pavlović (a consistent follower of Vuk) and Lazar Tomanović stood out, with Tomanović advocating for the introduction of graphemes ś and ź. Đuro Špadijer, in his Serbian Grammar (intended for 3rd and 4th grades in Montenegrin elementary schools), introduced some characteristics considered by Vuk&#x27;s model as dialectal and provincial.

However, from the school year 1863/64, Montenegro began the continuous implementation of Karadžić&#x27;s linguistic reform in Cetinje schools. This reform would ultimately achieve a definitive victory in Montenegro by the end of the 19th century, primarily in administrative, journalistic, and scientific styles.

The literary style, which retained fundamental Montenegrin linguistic features, resisted this process the longest and mostly remained beyond the reach of the mentioned reform, entering the 20th century with preserved foundational Montenegrin language characteristics. The preservation of typical Montenegrin language features in the literary style is evident in the works of three representative figures from that period: Petar II Petrović Njegoš, Stefan Mitrov Ljubiša, and Marko Miljanov Popović.

===Yugoslav era===
The most significant changes in the Montenegrin literary language occurred during the phase marked by the influence of Serbian linguist Aleksandar Belić, between the two World Wars. Montenegrin linguistic peculiarities, preserved in the literary style in the first two decades of the 20th century, were assimilated into the common &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot; linguistic template in the new socio-historical framework. Although Belić&#x27;s Orthography from 1923 formally allowed the use of ijekavian, he emphasized in that edition and subsequent ones that jekavian jotization is a dialectal phenomenon. Consequently, Montenegrins were obligated to use atypical non-jotized forms such as &quot;djed&quot; (grandfather), &quot;cjedilo&quot; (strainer), &quot;tjerati&quot; (to drive), &quot;sjesti&quot; (to sit), and so on.

In subsequent editions, Belić abolished the normative status of the so-called longer endings of pronominal-adjective declension (-ijem, -ijeh) and codified only the short endings. This led Vuk&#x27;s language model to be gradually abandoned by his followers. Despite the formal acknowledgment of ijekavian in literary language, the interwar period in Montenegro was marked by an increasing use of ekavian. The introduction of ekavian was implemented through education, as textbooks and teaching staff predominantly followed ekavian norms. This is vividly illustrated by writings in the Montenegrin press of that time.

The contemporary stage in the development of the Montenegrin literary language encompasses the period after World War II, with the improvement of the country&#x27;s status, the language&#x27;s standing also improved. Although Montenegro did not gain the right to name its language with its own name, during this period, institutions promoting the Montenegrin language were substantively developed. Associations and organizations like the Montenegrin PEN Center, Matica crnogorska, Duklja Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Institute for Montenegrin Language and Linguistics, and the Montenegrin Society of Independent Writers played a crucial role in preserving Montenegrin values. The Declaration on the Constitutional Status of the Montenegrin Language by the Montenegrin PEN Center in 1997 was a significant document emphasizing the autonomy of the Montenegrin language. These efforts culminated in the new Montenegrin Constitution of 2007, where the Montenegrin language gained official status for the first time. The establishment of the Council for the Standardization of the Montenegrin Language in 2008 and the adoption of the Montenegrin Spelling Book in 2009 represent significant steps in the standardization and affirmation of the Montenegrin language.

== Language standardization ==
In January 2008, the government of Montenegro formed the Board (Council) for Standardization of the Montenegrin Language, which aims to standardize the Montenegrin language according to international norms. Proceeding documents will, after verification, become a part of the educational programme in Montenegrin schools.

The first Montenegrin standard was officially proposed in July 2009. In addition to the letters prescribed by the Serbo-Croatian standard, the proposal introduced two additional letters, and , to replace the digraphs and . The Ministry of Education has accepted neither of the two drafts of the Council for the Standardization of the Montenegrin language, but instead adopted an alternate third one which was not a part of their work. The Council has criticized this act, saying it comes from &quot;a small group&quot; and that it contains an abundance of &quot;methodological, conceptual and linguistic errors&quot;. On 21 June 2010, the Council for General Education adopted the first &quot;Montenegrin Grammar&quot;.

The first written request for the assignment of an international code was submitted by the Montenegrin authorities to the technical committee ISO 639 in July 2008, with complete paperwork forwarded to Washington in September 2015. After a long procedure, the request was finally approved on Friday, December 8, 2017, and ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 code [cnr] was assigned to the Montenegrin language, effective December 21, 2017.

== Official status and speakers&#x27; preference ==
The language remains an ongoing issue in Montenegro. In the census of 1991, the vast majority of Montenegrin citizens, 510,320 or 82.97%, declared themselves speakers of the then-official language: Serbo-Croatian. The earlier 1981 population census had also recorded a Serbo-Croatian-speaking majority. However, in the first Communist censuses, the vast majority of the population declared Serbian to be their native language. Such had also been the case with the first recorded population census in Montenegro, in 1909, when approximately 95% of the population of the Principality of Montenegro claimed Serbian as their native language. According to the Constitution of Montenegro, the official language of the republic since 1992 has been &#x27;Serbian language of the ijekavian dialect&#x27;.

After World War II and until 1992, the official language of Montenegro was Serbo-Croatian. Before that, in the previous Montenegrin realm, the language in use was called Serbian. Serbian was the officially used language in Socialist Republic of Montenegro until after the 1950 Novi Sad Agreement, and Serbo-Croatian was introduced into the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro in 1974. Organizations promoting Montenegrin as a distinct language have appeared since 2004 when the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro regime introduced usage of the term. The new constitution, adopted on 19 October 2007, deemed Montenegrin to be the official language of Montenegro.

The most recent population census conducted in Montenegro was in 2011. According to it, 36.97% of the population (229,251) declared that their native language was Montenegrin, and 42.88% (265,895) declared it to be Serbian.

Mijat Šuković, a prominent Montenegrin lawyer, wrote a draft version of the constitution which passed the parliament&#x27;s constitutional committee. Šuković suggested that Montenegrin be declared the official language of Montenegro. The Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe, had a generally positive attitude towards the draft of the constitution but did not address the language and church issues, calling them symbolic. The new constitution ratified on 19 October 2007 declared Montenegrin to be the official language of Montenegro, but also gave some recognition to Albanian, Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian.

The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro and Social Democratic Party of Montenegro stand for simply stating the country&#x27;s official language to be Montenegrin, but this policy is opposed by the Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro, the People&#x27;s Party, the Democratic Serb Party, the Bosniak Party, and the Movement for Changes as well as by the Serb List coalition led by the Serb People&#x27;s Party. A referendum was not needed, however, as a two-thirds majority of the parliament voted for the Constitution, including the ruling coalition, Movement for Changes, the Bosniaks, and the Liberals, while the pro-Serbian parties voted against it and the Albanian minority parties abstained from voting. The Constitution was ratified and adopted on 19 October 2007, recognizing Montenegrin as the official language of Montenegro.

According to a poll of 1,001 Montenegrin citizens conducted by Matica crnogorska in 2014, the linguistic demographics were:
According to an early 2017 poll, 42.6% of Montenegro&#x27;s citizens have opted for Serbian as the name of their native language, while 37.9% for Montenegrin. A declaration of Montenegrin as their native language is not confined to ethnic Montenegrins. According to the 2011 census, a proportion of other ethnic groups in Montenegro have also claimed Montenegrin to be their native language. Most openly, Matica Muslimanska called on Muslims living in Montenegro to name their native language as Montenegrin.

== Linguistic considerations ==

Montenegrins speak Shtokavian, which is a prestige supradialect of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian. The dialect serves as a basis for the Montenegrin language. Some of the dialects are shared with the neighbouring Slavic nations, such as the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect and the Zeta–Raška dialect.

The Eastern Herzegovinian dialect is spoken in the majority of Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as areas in Croatia and Serbia, with Montenegro only partially codifying the dialect. The Zeta–Raška dialect is prevalent in mostly southern Montenegro and parts of the historical region of Raška in Serbia. It is mainly spoken by local ethnic Serbs, Montenegrins, Bosniaks and Muslims.

== Writing ==

The proponents of the separate Montenegrin language prefer using Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet over the Serbian Cyrillic. In both scripts, the Montenegrin alphabets have two additional letters (bold), which are easier to render in digital typography in the Latin alphabet due to their existence in Polish, but which must be created &quot;ad hoc&quot; using combining characters when typesetting Cyrillic.

=== Phonology and grammar ===
== Literature ==
Many literary works of authors from Montenegro provide examples of the local Montenegrin vernacular. The medieval literature was mostly written in Old Church Slavonic and its recensions, but most of the 19th century works were written in some of the dialects of Montenegro. They include the folk literature collected by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and other authors, as well as the books of writers from Montenegro such as Petar Petrović Njegoš&#x27;s &quot;The Mountain Wreath&quot; (&quot;Gorski vijenac&quot;), Marko Miljanov&#x27;s &quot;The Examples of Humanity and Bravery&quot; (&quot;Primjeri čojstva i junaštva&quot;), etc. In the second half of the 19th century and later, the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect, which served as a basis for the standard Serbo-Croatian language, was often used instead of the Zeta–South Raška dialect characteristic of most dialects of Montenegro. Petar Petrović Njegoš, one of the most respectable Montenegrin authors, changed many characteristics of the Zeta–South Raška dialect from the manuscript of his &quot;Gorski vijenac&quot; to those proposed by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić as a standard for the Serbian language.

For example, most of the accusatives of place used in the Zeta–South Raška dialect were changed by Njegoš to the locatives used in the Serbian standard. Thus the stanzas &quot;U dobro je lako dobar biti, / na muku se poznaju junaci&quot; from the manuscript were changed to &quot;U dobru je lako dobar biti, / na muci se poznaju junaci&quot; in the printed version. Other works of later Montenegrin authors were also often modified to the East Herzegovinian forms in order to follow the Serbian language literary norm. However, some characteristics of the traditional Montenegrin Zeta–South Raška dialect sometimes appeared. For example, the poem &quot;Onamo namo&quot; by Nikola I Petrović Njegoš, although it was written in the East Herzegovinian Serbian standard, contains several Zeta–South Raška forms: &quot;Onamo namo, za brda ona&quot; (accusative, instead of instrumental case &quot;za brdima onim&quot;), and &quot;Onamo namo, da viđu&quot; (instead of &quot;vidim&quot;) &quot;Prizren&quot;, and so on.

== Language politics ==

Most mainstream politicians and other proponents of the Montenegrin language state that the issue is chiefly one of self-determination and the people&#x27;s right to call the language what they want, rather than an attempt to artificially create a new language when there is none. The Declaration of the Montenegrin PEN Center states that the &quot;Montenegrin language does not mean a systemically separate language, but just one of four names (Montenegrin, Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian) by which Montenegrins name their part of [the] Shtokavian system, commonly inherited with Muslims, Serbs and Croats&quot;. Therefore, in 2017, numerous prominent writers, scientists, journalists, activists and other public figures from Montenegro, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia signed the Declaration on the Common Language, which states that in Montenegro, Croatia, Serbia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina a common polycentric standard language is used, consisting of several standard varieties, similar to the situation of languages like German, English or Spanish.

The introduction of the Montenegrin language has been supported by other important academic institutions such as the Matica crnogorska, although meeting opposition from the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts. Some proponents go further. The chief proponent of Montenegrin was Zagreb-educated Vojislav Nikčević, professor at the Department of Language and Literature at the University of Montenegro and the head of the Institute for Montenegrin Language in the capital Podgorica. His dictionaries and grammars were printed by Croatian publishers since the major Montenegrin publishing houses such as Obod in Cetinje opted for the official nomenclature specified in the Constitution (Serbian until 1974, Serbo-Croatian to 1992, Serbian until 2007). Nikčević advocates amending the Latin alphabet with three letters Ś, Ź, and З and corresponding Cyrillic letters С́, З́ and Ѕ (representing IPA , and respectively).

Opponents acknowledge that these sounds can be heard by many Montenegrin speakers, however, they do not form a language system and thus are allophones rather than phonemes. In addition, there are speakers in Montenegro who do not utter them and speakers of Serbian and Croatian outside of Montenegro (notably in Herzegovina and Bosanska Krajina) who do. In addition, introduction of those letters could pose significant technical difficulties (the Eastern European character encoding ISO/IEC 8859-2 does not contain the letter З, for example, and the corresponding letters were not proposed for Cyrillic).

Prime minister Milo Đukanović declared his open support for the formalization of the Montenegrin language by declaring himself as a speaker of Montenegrin in an October 2004 interview with Belgrade daily . Official Montenegrin government communiqués are given in &quot;English and Montenegrin&quot; on the government&#x27;s webpage.

In 2004, the government of Montenegro changed the school curriculum so that the name of the mandatory classes teaching the language was changed from &quot;Serbian language&quot; to &quot;Mother tongue (Serbian, Montenegrin, Croatian, Bosnian)&quot;. This change was made, according to the government, in order to better reflect the diversity of languages spoken among citizens in the republic and to protect human rights of non-Serb citizens in Montenegro who declare themselves as speakers of other languages.

This decision resulted in a number of teachers declaring a strike and parents refusing to send their children to schools. The cities affected by the strike included Nikšić, Podgorica, Berane, Pljevlja and Herceg Novi. The new letters had been used for official documents since 2009 but in February 2017, the Assembly of Montenegro removed them from the official webpage.

<text>The Jackson Avenue station is a local station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Jackson and Westchester Avenues in the Longwood neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the train at all times, and the train at all times except late nights and rush hours in the peak direction.

The Jackson Avenue station opened on November 26, 1904, as part of the initial segment of the IRT White Plains Road Line. The station was first served by elevated trains from the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line, and direct service from the IRT Lenox Avenue Line started in 1905. The Bergen Avenue cutoff, which carried trains between Jackson Avenue and the Third Avenue Line&#x27;s express tracks, was in operation from 1917 to 1946. The platforms were extended in 1949, and the northbound fare control area was replaced after a 1977 fire. The station has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2004.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The first contract for the construction of a subway in New York, Contract 1, was executed on February 21, 1900, between the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners and the Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont, for the construction of the subway and a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. Contract 1 called for the construction of a line from City Hall north to Kingsbridge and a branch under Lenox Avenue and to Bronx Park.

The initial segment of the IRT White Plains Road Line opened on November 26, 1904, between East 180th Street and this station. Initially, trains on the line were served by elevated trains from the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line, with a connection running from the Third Avenue local tracks at Third Avenue and 149th Street to Westchester Avenue and Eagle Avenue. Once the connection to the IRT Lenox Avenue Line opened on July 10, 1905, trains from the newly opened IRT subway ran via the line. Elevated service via this connection was resumed on October 1, 1907, when Second Avenue local trains were extended to Freeman Street during rush hours.

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The northbound platform at the Jackson Avenue station was extended to the front, while the southbound platform was not lengthened. On January 23, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the White Plains Road Line.

=== Later years ===
On July 1, 1917, a new connection between the White Plains Road Line and the Third Avenue elevated express tracks was opened as part of the Dual Contracts expansion of the Third Avenue Line, and since it ran via Bergen Avenue and bypassed the 149th Street station, it was called the Bergen Avenue cutoff or bypass. The Bergen Avenue cutoff was abandoned on November 5, 1946, as part of the gradual curtailment of elevated service on the IRT Third Avenue Line.

The New York State Transit Commission announced plans to extend the southbound platforms at seven stations on the line from Jackson Avenue to 177th Street to accommodate ten-car trains for $81,900 on August 8, 1934. The platform at Jackson Avenue would be lengthened from to .

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. On June 13, 1949, the platform extensions at this station, as well as those on White Plains Road Line stations north to 177th Street, opened. The platforms were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to open their doors. Previously the stations could only accommodate six-car local trains.

In March 1976, the token booth and a portion of the waiting area on the northbound platform were destroyed in a fire. In 1977, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) decided that it was not justified to fund the rebuild of the token booth and the cost of manning it due to the low number of entries at the platform. The NYCTA estimated that rebuilding the booth would cost $260,000 in 1980, and that $15,000 to $20,000 could be spent to install a temporary token booth, with $80,000 more to man the booth; this plan was subsequently abandoned, as it would require an estimated 570 entries per day for the booth to break-even. The NYCTA then installed a high-entry turnstile on this platform. At the time, there were at least a dozen more stations that had no token booth on one side of the tracks. While the northbound-platform station house was closed, riders were funneled directly to the exit stairs.

==Station layout==

This station, located in Longwood, has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the 5 train during rush hours in the peak direction. West of this station, the elevated structure widens with room for two more tracks, where the connection to the Third Avenue Line was located. These tracks diverged, with the connection to the Third Avenue local tracks going via Westchester Avenue, and the connection to the Third Avenue express tracks, the Bergen Avenue bypass going south via Bergen Avenue. Beyond the vestiges of the old connections, the line curves west and enters the tunnel into Third Avenue–149th Street. Because this station is near the tunnel portal, it is closer to the ground than the other elevated stations further north on the line.

Both platforms have beige windscreens with green outlines and red canopies with green support frames and columns in the center and lime green, waist-high, steel fences at either ends. The station signs are in the standard black with white lettering.

As with other original IRT elevated viaducts, the elevated structure at Jackson Avenue is carried on two column bents, one on each side of the road, at places where the tracks are no more than above the ground level. There is zigzag lateral bracing at intervals of every four panels.

This station has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since September 17, 2004, because of its importance as one of the first stations built as part of the IRT subway. The 2009 artwork at the station is called &quot;Latin American Stories&quot; by George Crespo. It consists of four stained glass panels on the windscreens of each platform and two sets of window niches on each station house. They depict images from six Latin American stories, including &quot;How Fire Came to the Rain Forest&quot; and &quot;The King That Tried to Touch the Moon from the Lesser Antilles&quot;.

Both platforms have an elevated Queen Anne style station house near their rears, and there are no crossovers or crossunders between the platforms. The station houses are staggered by about . Designed by Heins &amp; LaFarge, the station houses consist of steel framing topped by hip roofs. The center bay of each station house includes projecting dormers used for ventilation. The top of the center bay includes a decorated gable that is supported by corbels. The red metal roof overhangs the station house and contains fleur-de-lis ridge cresting. The interiors of each station house include a small wooden-floored waiting area, as well as a niche where there was formerly a radiator. There were also restrooms inside the station houses, but these were later converted to storage areas. C-shaped brackets support signage. The staircases from each station house to street level are covered by canopies and have elaborate handrails.

On the Manhattan-bound side, doors from the platform lead to a small waiting area, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the station. Outside of fare control, there is a token booth and two sets of doors leading to two staircases facing in opposite directions that go down to the west side of Westchester Avenue. The platform has two exit-only turnstiles, each of which leads to either street staircase, to allow passengers to exit the station without having to go through the station house.

The station house on the northbound platform is unstaffed. Four doors lead to a waiting area where two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and one exit-only turnstile provide access to/from the station. Outside fare control, a set of doors lead to balcony where two double-flight, twisting staircases go down to the northeast corner of Westchester and Jackson Avenues. The platform has one exit-only turnstile leading to the staircase balcony.

<text>Howard Scott Gentry (December 10, 1903 – April 1, 1993) was an American botanist recognized as the world&#x27;s leading authority on the agaves.

Gentry was born in Temecula, California. In 1931 he received an A.B. (bachelor&#x27;s) degree in vertebrate zoology from the University of California at Berkeley. In 1947, Gentry received a Ph.D. in botany from the University of Michigan, Dissertation: &quot;The Durango Grasslands&quot;.

Gentry made his first field trip to the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico in 1933. He spent most of the next twenty years exploring and recording the plant life of northwestern Mexico. He worked for the United States Department of Agriculture from 1950 to 1971. He made botanical field trips to Europe, India and Africa looking for plants that are useful to man. He was a research botanist with the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona after 1971. He also collected many of the specimens now at the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California.

His 1942 study of the plants of the Río Mayo region of northwestern Mexico became a classic for the extent of its coverage of a previously little-known area.

In addition to purely botanical work, he was interested in ethnobotany, and his plant descriptions include information about their uses by indigenous peoples.

<doc id="729767" wikidata="Q3247051" url="?curid=729767" title="Peel (tool)">
<text>A peel is a tool used by bakers to slide loaves of bread, pizzas, pastries, and other baked goods into and out of an oven. It is usually made of wood, with a flat surface for carrying the baked good and a handle extending from one side of that surface. Alternatively, the carrying surface may be made of sheet metal, which is attached to a wooden handle. Wood has the advantage that it does not become hot enough to burn the user&#x27;s hands the way metal can, even if it is frequently in the oven. The word presumably derives from the French &quot;pelle&quot;, which describes both a peel and a shovel.
A peel&#x27;s intended functions are to:

* Transfer delicate breads, pastries, etc into an oven where transferring them directly by hand could deform their delicate structure.
* Allow food to be placed further back in an oven than could normally be reached by the baker.
* Keep the baker&#x27;s hands out of the hottest part of an oven, or prevent the baker from burning their hands on the hot baked goods.

Prior to use, peels are often sprinkled with flour, cornmeal, or milled wheat bran, to allow baked goods to easily slide onto and off them.
There are peels of many sizes, with the length of the handle suited to the depth of the oven, and the size of the carrying surface suited to the size of the food it is meant to carry (for instance, slightly larger than the diameter of a pizza). Household peels commonly have handles around 15 cm long and carrying surfaces around 35 cm square, though handles range in length from vestigial (~6 centimeters) to extensive (~1.5 meters or more), and carrying surfaces range in size from miniature (~12 centimeters square) to considerably wide (1 meter square or more).

==Other tools==
An alternative, and related, meaning of the word &quot;peel&quot; is a wooden pole with a smooth cross-piece at one end, which was used in printing houses of the hand-press period (before around 1850) to raise printed sheets onto a line to dry, and to take them down again once dried. The term is also sometimes used for the blade of an oar. All three meanings derive ultimately from the Latin , a spade.

<doc id="729768" wikidata="Q6211760" url="?curid=729768" title="Joe Penner">
<text>Joe Penner (born József Pintér; November 11, 1904 – January 10, 1941) was an American vaudeville, radio, and film comedian.

==Vaudeville and burlesque==
In 1917, Penner&#x27;s acts in which he dressed as Charlie Chaplin earned him 38 cents per week. Thanks to his clowning and &quot;Wanna Buy a Duck?&quot; routine, he was soon in small-time burlesque and vaudeville. A high point came when he performed in the &quot;Greenwich Village Follies&quot; in Chicago in 1926. After this break, he toured in mainstream vaudeville until its gradual demise around 1932.

==Radio==

Penner&#x27;s films include &quot;College Rhythm&quot; (1934) and &quot;New Faces of 1937&quot;. He developed his catch phrases in burlesque. In 1932 he toured in a vaudeville revue with Eddie Tamblyn, father of actor Russ Tamblyn. He was launched on his successful radio career by Rudy Vallée, appearances which led to his own Sunday evening half-hour, &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Broadcast&quot;, which began on NBC&#x27;s Blue Network on October 8, 1933. Penner was a zany comic, noted for his famed catchphrase, &quot;Wanna buy a duck?&quot;, and his low hyuck-hyuck laugh.

He was voted radio&#x27;s top comedian in 1934, but a 1935 dispute with the ad agency over the show&#x27;s format resulted in Penner quitting &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Broadcast&quot; on June 30, 1935. &quot;Vox Pop&quot; began as a summer replacement series for Penner in 1935. A year later, he returned with &quot;The Joe Penner Show&quot;, which began airing October 4, 1936 on CBS, sponsored by Cocomalt, with Harry Conn as his new head writer.

==Reception in film==
He was caricatured by Tex Avery and Friz Freleng in the musical cartoon, &quot;My Green Fedora&quot;, the Popeye the Sailor cartoon &quot;Can You Take It?&quot;, several pictures starring the bumbling stooge Egghead, and the Disney cartoon &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot; in which he says &quot;Wanna buy a duck?&quot; with Donald Duck on a plate.

After covering the 1932–34 rise of Jack Pearl, Elizabeth McLeod summed up Penner&#x27;s popularity:The ultimate Depression-era zany was Joe Penner. A forgotten performer today to most, and little more than a footnote to the average OTR [old-time radio] fan, Penner was a national craze in 1933–34. There is no deep social meaning in his comedy, no shades of subtlety — just utter slapstick foolishness, delivered in an endearingly simpering style that&#x27;s the closest thing the 1930s had to Pee-wee Herman. An added attraction was Penner&#x27;s in-character singing each week of a whimsical novelty song, specially written to suit his style. Like Pearl, however, Penner was doomed to early decline by the sheer repetitiveness of his format, even though he remained very popular with children right up to the end of his radio career. 

==Personal life==
In 1928, he married showgirl Eleanor May Vogt.

Penner died from a heart attack in his sleep in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on January 10, 1941, aged 36. His funeral in Los Angeles was attended by more than 2,000 people.

<doc id="729770" wikidata="Q664340" url="?curid=729770" title="Third Avenue–149th Street station">
<text>The Third Avenue–149th Street station is a station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. It is located at Third Avenue and East 149th Street (the latter of which is also known as Eugenio Maria de Hostos Boulevard) in the Hub in the South Bronx adjacent to Mott Haven and Melrose. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and the 5 train at all times except nights. The station is the second-busiest in the Bronx and 59th overall, with around 6.768 million passengers using the station as of 2019.

==History==

The station opened on July 10, 1905, along with the 149th Street–Grand Concourse station and the connection with the IRT Lenox Avenue Line in Manhattan. Free transfers were provided between the subway and the existing 149th Street elevated station of the IRT Third Avenue Line, which opened in 1887. The convergence of the two rapid transit lines, the surface trolley lines along Third Avenue and 149th Street, and the ensuing commercial development led to the coining of the name &quot;the Hub&quot; for the intersection in the early 20th century.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. Following the closure of the Third Avenue elevated in 1973, free paper transfers were provided between the subway and the Bx55 limited-stop bus, which replaced the elevated. However, scalpers would often resell these transfers for 50 cents. Because of the unique transfer, the station was one of the first to test the MetroCard system in the early 1990s, and the paper transfers were finally scrapped in 1997 with the wider rollout of the MetroCard.

In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system.

In 1996, ceramic mosaics by Jose Ortega were installed at the station, as part of the MTA&#x27;s Arts for Transit program.

==Station layout==
The station has two tracks and two side platforms, with no crossovers between the platforms. The station has been renovated, with ADA-accessible elevators installed on both sides of the station.
The station tiles have dark red and dark green/gray lower accents and dark red upper border. There are ceramic mosaics, installed in 1996 under the MTA&#x27;s Arts for Transit program, entitled &quot;Una Raza, Un Mundo, Universo&quot; (&quot;One Race, One World, One Universe&quot;), by Jose Ortega. Four such mosaics are on each platform near the fare control. The token booths are built into the wall. Prior to the renovation, terra cotta &quot;3&quot; plaques were on the platform walls. One of these has been preserved at the New York Transit Museum.

Immediately east (railroad north) of the station, past Bergen Avenue, the tracks ascend to become an elevated structure for the trip to East 180th Street. This is the longest section of elevated track built under IRT Contract I. At the El level, one can still see the shortened supports for former track connections with the Third Avenue El. The express run to the next express station north, East 180th Street is long and bypasses seven stations, making it the second-longest express run in the system behind the express run between 125th Street and 59th Street–Columbus Circle on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, which also bypasses seven stations.

===Exits===
The fare control is at platform level and there is a closed crossunder. Each fare control area has a bus transfer booth, which was used for the connection to the former Bx55 bus route that replaced the IRT Third Avenue Line in the Bronx. The extra booths and turnstiles, while still present, are no longer in use, having closed in July 1997 when system-wide free transfers were introduced with the MetroCard.

For each platform, three staircases lead up from fare control to the street; the north side of 149th Street for the Manhattan-bound platform, and the south side for the Bronx-bound platform. The elevators are located on the west side of the intersection. As of December 2023, both elevators are closed for replacement and are scheduled to reopen in June 2024.

<text>The Prospect Avenue station is a local station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Prospect and Westchester Avenues in the Longwood neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the train at all times, and the train at all times except late nights and rush hours in the peak direction.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The initial segment of the IRT White Plains Road Line opened on November 26, 1904 between 180th Street–Bronx Park and Jackson Avenue. Initially, trains on the line were served by elevated trains from the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line. Once the connection to the IRT Lenox Avenue Line opened on July 10, 1905, trains from the newly opened IRT subway ran via the line.

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The northbound platform at the Prospect Avenue station was extended about to the front and to the rear, while the southbound platform was not lengthened. On January 23, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the White Plains Road Line.

=== Later years ===
The New York State Transit Commission announced plans to extend the southbound platforms at seven stations on the line from Jackson Avenue to 177th Street to accommodate ten-car trains for $81,900 on August 8, 1934. The platform at Prospect Avenue would be lengthened from to .

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The Bergen Avenue cutoff, which allowed Third Avenue trains to access the White Plains Road Line, was abandoned on November 5, 1946, as part of the gradual curtailment of elevated service on the IRT Third Avenue Line. On June 13, 1949, the platform extensions at this station, as well as those on White Plains Road Line stations between Jackson Avenue and 177th Street, opened. The platforms were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to open their doors. Previously the stations could only accommodate six-car local trains.

This station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 2004. It was renovated in 2006. As part of its 2025–2029 Capital Program, the MTA has proposed making the station wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

==Station layout==

The station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the 5 train during rush hours in the peak direction.

The center of both platforms have beige windscreens with green frames, red canopies, and green support columns. The ends have waist high, green steel fences with lampposts at regular intervals. The station signs are in the standard black station name plate with white lettering.

As with other original IRT elevated viaducts, the elevated structure at Prospect Avenue is carried on two column bents, one on each side of the road, at places where the tracks are no more than above the ground level. There is zigzag lateral bracing at intervals of every four panels.

The 2006 artwork here is called &quot;Bronx, Four Seasons&quot; by Ukrainian artist Marina Tsersarskaya. It consists of stained glass panels on the platform windscreens and station houses depicting images related the four seasons of meteorology.

===Exits===
This station is very close to street level. As a result, the stations houses are adjacent to their respective platforms and there are no crossovers or crossunders.

On the Manhattan-bound side, one staircase from the northwest corner of Westchester Avenue and 160th Street goes up to the north side of the station house. Another from the northern intersection of Prospect Avenue and 160th Street goes up to the south side. Inside the station house, there is a token booth, turnstile bank, waiting area, and doors leading to the platform. The platform has two exit-only turnstiles, each of which leads to one of the street stairs.

On the northbound side, two staircases from the northeast corner of Longwood and Westchester Avenues go up to the north side of the station house, which has a now closed customer assistance booth, turnstile bank, waiting area, and doors leading directly to the platform. A high exit-only turnstile from the platform leads directly to the staircases. Towards the south end of the platform, another exit-only turnstile leads to a double-flight staircase going down to the northeast corner of Prospect and Westchester Avenue. Both station houses have heaters.

<text>The Intervale Avenue station (formerly the Intervale Avenue–163rd Street station) is a local station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Intervale and Westchester Avenues in the Longwood neighborhood of the Bronx within Intervale Valley, it is served by the train at all times, and the train at all times except late nights and rush hours in the peak direction.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The initial segment of the IRT White Plains Road Line opened on November 26, 1904 between 180th Street–Bronx Park and Jackson Avenue. The Intervale Avenue station opened on April 30, 1910 as an infill station on the White Plains Road Line, and was the first station in the Bronx with escalators. It was built at the cost of $100,000, which was paid with private capital. The station was originally served by trains from the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line, both now demolished. In addition, IRT Lenox Avenue Line trains also stopped at this station.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
The New York State Transit Commission announced plans to extend the southbound platforms at seven stations on the line from Jackson Avenue to 177th Street to accommodate ten-car trains for $81,900 on August 8, 1934. The platform at Intervale Avenue would be lengthened from to .

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The Bergen Avenue cutoff, which allowed Third Avenue trains to access the White Plains Road Line, was abandoned on November 5, 1946, as part of the gradual curtailment of elevated service on the IRT Third Avenue Line. On June 13, 1949, the platform extensions at this station, as well as those on White Plains Road Line stations between Jackson Avenue and 177th Street, opened. The platforms were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to open their doors. Previously the stations could only accommodate six-car local trains.

=== Station house arson ===
On March 15, 1989, three men set the wooden station house on fire after a failed attempt to rob the token booth. The clerk was not seriously injured, while the suspects fled and were never identified.

After the incident, New York City Transit considered closing this station indefinitely due to its close proximity to Prospect Avenue and Simpson Street. However, a community uproar led to the scrapping of the plans. The station was rebuilt with steel canopies and windscreens and a concrete station house with glass block windows and embossed leather-looking walls. Renovations took two and a half years. Artwork called &quot;El 2/El 5&quot; by Michael Kelly Williams was installed in the mezzanine and features two mosaic murals depicting underground and elevated tracks. The renovated station reopened on April 21, 1992 after twenty months of work was completed.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the 5 train during rush hours in the peak direction. Both platforms have beige windscreens that run along the entire length and brown canopies with green frames and support columns in the center.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only entrance is an elevated station house beneath the tracks. Inside fare control, it has two staircases to the center of each platform and a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions. Outside fare control, there is a turnstile bank, token booth, one staircase going down to the southeast corner of Intervale and Westchester Avenues, and one staircase and one enclosed escalator (both perpendicular from each other) going down to the northeast corner.

<doc id="729774" wikidata="Q6934979" url="?curid=729774" title="Multiplex (juggling)">
<text>Multiplexing is a juggling trick or form of toss juggling where more than one ball is in the hand at the time of the throw. The opposite, a squeeze catch, is when more than one ball is caught in the hand simultaneously on the same beat. If a multiplex throw were time-reversed, it would be a squeeze catch.

==Terminology==

===Number of props===
Multiplex throws are given different names depending on the number of balls used, for example a one-ball throw (with one ball held) would be called a uniplex, a two-ball throw would be called a duplex, and a three-ball throw, a triplex. A four and a five-ball throw would be called a quadruplex and a quintuplex, respectively.

===Throw types===
Multiplex throws are generally grouped into different categories: Stack, Split, Cut, and Slice.

Stacked multiplex throws involve throwing both balls from one hand and catching them both in the same or other hand.

Split multiplex throws, as the name suggests, involve throwing both balls from one hand, &quot;splitting&quot; them in the air, and catching them in separate hands.

Cut multiplex throws involve throwing both balls to the same or other hand like a stacked multiplex but in a staggered fashion so the bottom ball of the duplex is caught, and re-thrown before the top ball is caught. These are used in the Shower Explosion family of multiplex tricks.

Sliced multiplex throws involve throwing both balls with one ball going directly to the opposite hand as a pass. This throw is usually made with the catching hand directly above the throwing hand so that when the throw is made, one ball goes straight up into the catching hand, with little to no air time, while the remaining ball is caught on a later beat.

In the case of triplexes, a split can result in one or two balls being caught in the opposite hand. An &#x27;inside&#x27; split triplex denotes one ball being caught in the opposite hand, due to the single ball being on the inside of the triplex, and an &#x27;outside&#x27; split triplex denotes two balls being caught in the opposite hand.

A cut and split multiplex can be combined in a triplex and this is referred to as a cut-split triplex indicating that both types of throw are involved.

===Air position===
Multiplex throws can be further classified depending upon the position of the balls in the air after the throw is made. In the case of duplexes, two balls side by side is a horizontal duplex, and two balls one above the other is a vertical duplex. This terminology can be applied to either the stack, split or cut duplex types of throw. So, a vertical stacked duplex refers to two balls being thrown together, one above the other in the air, and caught together in the same or other hand. A horizontal split duplex refers to two balls being thrown together, side by side in the air, and caught in separate hands. In the case of triplexes, three balls one above the other is a vertical triplex and three balls in a triangle pattern is a triangle triplex.

==Notation==
Siteswap notation is a way of writing down a key feature of juggling patterns: the order in which the balls are thrown. Multiplex throws are notated inside square brackets [ ]. For example, two balls held in the hand for a beat is notated [22] while [54] represents a split duplex where one ball is rethrown five beats later and the other ball four beats later.

When working out the average of a multiplex siteswap, to determine the number of balls in the pattern, the throws inside the brackets are added together but treated as one throw. So, [43]23 = [4+3]+2+3 = 12. 12 / 3 (throws) = a 4-ball pattern.

It is possible to combine two siteswaps to make a new trick. The three-ball siteswap &#x27;423&#x27; and the two-ball siteswap &#x27;330&#x27; combined give the five-ball siteswap [43][32]3. Since siteswaps can be rotated, 330 can also be read as &#x27;033&#x27; and &#x27;303&#x27; and thus, when combined with 423, give the five-ball siteswaps 4[32][33] and [43]2[33] respectively.

If two siteswaps of differing lengths are combined, for instance 423 and 31, the length of the new siteswap can be determined by multiplying the two lengths together. Using the aforementioned siteswaps as an example, 423 (length 3) and 31 (length 2) give the siteswap [43][21][33][41][32][31] (length 6).

==Styles==

===Claymotion===
Claymotion is a style of multiplex juggling that was developed by British juggler Richard Clay in the early 1990s and was first given the name &#x27;Claymotion&#x27; by Erica Kelch-Slesnick in 1997. Claymotion juggling is a sub-category of multiplex juggling that has a start-stop rhythm to it, not unlike cigar box juggling, so there are times when there are no balls in the air. Emphasis is placed on the graceful movements of the arms and so throws are typically low and controlled.

<text>The Simpson Street station is a local station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Simpson Street and Westchester Avenue in the Longwood neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the train at all times, and the train at all times except late nights and rush hours in the peak direction.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The initial segment of the IRT White Plains Road Line opened on November 26, 1904, between 180th Street–Bronx Park and Jackson Avenue. Initially, trains on the line were served by elevated trains from the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line. Once the connection to the IRT Lenox Avenue Line opened on July 10, 1905, trains from the newly opened IRT subway ran via the line.

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The northbound platform at the Simpson Street station was extended to the front and to the rear, while the southbound platform was not lengthened. On January 23, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the White Plains Road Line.

=== Later years ===
The New York State Transit Commission announced plans to extend the southbound platforms at seven stations on the line from Jackson Avenue to 177th Street, including Simpson Street to accommodate ten-car trains for $81,900 on August 8, 1934.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The Bergen Avenue cutoff, which allowed Third Avenue trains to access the White Plains Road Line, was abandoned on November 5, 1946, as part of the gradual curtailment of elevated service on the IRT Third Avenue Line. On June 13, 1949, the platform extensions at this station, as well as those on White Plains Road Line stations between Jackson Avenue and 177th Street, opened. The platforms were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to open their doors. Previously the stations could only accommodate six-car local trains.

The station was renovated in the early 2000s. This station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 2004, along with the Westchester-Simpson Street Substation, also known as IRT Substation #18.

==Station layout==
This station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center express track is used by the 5 train during rush hours in the peak direction. To the north, the line curves from Westchester Avenue to Southern Boulevard. The IRT Pelham Line (), which curves above Westchester Avenue five blocks northeast of this station, is visible from the east end of the platforms.

As with other original IRT elevated viaducts, the elevated structure at Simpson Street is carried on two column bents, one on each side of the road, at places where the tracks are no more than above the ground level. There is zigzag lateral bracing at intervals of every four panels.

Both platforms have cream-colored windscreens and red canopies. Both platforms also have green outlines, frames, and support columns in their center and green waist-high, ornament-style steel fences at either ends with several lampposts. The station&#x27;s signs are in the standard black name plates with white Helvetica lettering.

===Exits===
Due to the tracks&#x27; low height above ground, both station houses are at platform level and there are no crossovers or crossunders. Elevators from the street to each platform make this station ADA-accessible. The station&#x27;s elevators were installed in August 1989, making the station one of the earliest to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

The southbound platform (for trains headed to Manhattan) has a station house that is staffed full-time and contains several sets of doors leading to the small waiting area from the platform, a turnstile bank, token booth, two staircases going down to either northern corners of Simpson Street and Westchester Avenue, and one elevator going down to the northeast corner. A high exit-only turnstile on either side of the station house leads directly to one of the street stairs from the platform.

The northbound platform&#x27;s station house is unstaffed, containing several sets of doors leading to the small waiting area from the platform, a bank of three turnstiles, two staircases going down to either southern corners of Simpson Street and Westchester Avenue, and one elevator going down to the southwest corner. It had a customer assistance booth until April 2010. A high exit-only turnstile on either side of the station house leads directly to one of the street stairs from the platform.

===Artwork===
The 2006 artwork here is called &quot;What We Build is Not Permanent, We Are Not What We Build&quot; by Lisa Amowitz. It consists of stained glass panels on the platform windscreens and station houses with the theme with renewing or rebuilding what has died or fallen.

<text>Samuel Rudolph Insanally (23 January 1936 – 26 November 2023) was a Guyanese diplomat. He was Guyana&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1987 onwards and was Minister of Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guyana from 2001 to 2008.

==Early life==
Insanally was born in Georgetown, Guyana on 23 January 1936. Before his career as a diplomat began, he taught French and Spanish in Jamaica at Kingston College and Jamaica College, as well as in Guyana at Queen&#x27;s College and the University of Guyana.

==Diplomatic career==
In his first diplomatic posting, he was Counsellor to Guyana&#x27;s Embassy to the United States from 1966 to 1969, and he subsequently became Guyana&#x27;s &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; in Venezuela in 1970. He was briefly his country&#x27;s Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in 1972, then served as Ambassador to Venezuela (with additional accreditation for Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru) from 1972 to 1978.

<text>The Freeman Street station is a local station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Freeman Street and Southern Boulevard in the Crotona Park East neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the train at all times, and the train at all times except late nights and rush hours in the peak direction.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The first contract for the construction of a subway in New York, Contract 1, was executed on February 21, 1900, between the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners and the Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont, for the construction of the subway and a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. Contract 1 called for the construction of a line from City Hall north to Kingsbridge and a branch under Lenox Avenue and to Bronx Park. The initial segment of the IRT White Plains Road Line opened on November 26, 1904 between 180th Street–Bronx Park and Jackson Avenue. Initially, trains on the line were served by elevated trains from the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line. Once the connection to the IRT Lenox Avenue Line opened on July 10, 1905, trains from the newly opened IRT subway ran via the line.

As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The northbound platform at the Freeman Street station was extended to the front and to the rear, while the southbound platform was not lengthened. On January 23, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the White Plains Road Line.

On December 29, 1914, the PSC approved a resolution approving a plan to construct an additional stairway to the station at the northeast corner of Southern Boulevard and Freeman Street. Work started on August 20, 1915, and was completed on October 29, 1915.

The New York City Board of Estimate approved a contract to construct a signal tower at the station&#x27;s northern end on October 18, 1928.

=== Station renovations ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The New York State Transit Commission announced plans to extend the southbound platforms at seven stations on the line from Jackson Avenue to 177th Street to accommodate ten-car trains for $81,900 on August 8, 1934. The platform at Freeman Street would be lengthened from to .

Up until 1946, a limited number of rush-hour northbound trains on the Second and Third Avenue Lines terminated at this station, relaying north of it to turn around for southbound service. The Bergen Avenue cutoff, which allowed Third Avenue trains to access the White Plains Road Line, was abandoned on November 5, 1946, as part of the gradual curtailment of elevated service on the IRT Third Avenue Line. On June 13, 1949, the platform extensions at this station, as well as those on White Plains Road Line stations between Jackson Avenue and 177th Street, opened. The platforms were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to open their doors. Previously, the stations could only platform six-car local trains.

The station was renovated between July and October 2004. The interlocking north of the station and the tower controlling it were both removed in March 2004 when the line was re-signaled to B Division specifications.

==Station layout==

This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center express track is used by the 5 train during rush hours in the peak direction.

As with other original IRT elevated viaducts, the elevated structure at Freeman Street is carried on two column bents, one on each side of the road, at places where the tracks are no more than above the ground level. There is zigzag lateral bracing at intervals of every four panels.

The 2007 artwork at this station, &quot;The El&quot;, was designed by the artist Daniel Hauben and commissioned through the MTA Arts &amp; Design program. It consists of four faceted-glass windbreaks and two niche windows, depicting the roadway and the elevated tracks above, which recede in the background. According to the artist, the artwork is designed to convey a &quot;feeling of both great depth and the sprawling vastness of the city&quot;.

===Exits===
The station has heaters, as well as a wooden mezzanine, floor, and open old booth similar to the one at Simpson Street. Exits lead to all corners of Freeman Street and Southern Boulevard.

On June 18, 1915, the PSC approved a resolution approving a plan to relocate two supporting columns and one stairway at the station to accommodate the widening of 174th Street. The work, which was paid for by the borough of the Bronx, started on May 2, 1916, and was completed in August 1916.

==Station layout==

This elevated station, which has two side platforms and three tracks, is built on a curve, which results in large gaps between the center doors of trains and the platform. The gaps were almost wide enough to need gap fillers. By 2008, most of the station&#x27;s gaps had been filled, but train announcements still warn passengers to &quot;be careful of the gap between the platform and the train.&quot;

The station has a white windscreen and black fencing. The ends of the platform are very narrow.

The 2004 artwork here is called &quot;A Trip up the Bronx River&quot; by Daniel del Valle. It features stained glass windows on the platform windscreens and station house depicting sites along the Bronx River.

===Exits===
The station does not have a mezzanine, therefore in-system transfers between the two directions are not possible. The station houses are at the same level as the platforms. The two southbound exits lead to the northwestern corner of the skewed intersection of 174th Street and Southern Boulevard. The two northbound exits are on either eastern corner of that intersection.

<text>Gingerbread refers to a broad category of baked goods, typically flavored with ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon and sweetened with honey, sugar, or molasses. Gingerbread foods vary, ranging from a moist loaf cake to forms nearly as crisp as a ginger snap.

==Etymology==
Originally, the term &quot;gingerbread&quot; (from Latin via Old French &#x27;) referred to preserved ginger. It then referred to a confection made with honey and spices. &quot;Gingerbread&quot; is often used to translate the French term &quot;pain d&#x27;épices&quot; () or the German and Polish terms &quot;Pfefferkuchen&quot; and &quot;Piernik&quot; respectively ( because it used to contain pepper) or &quot;Lebkuchen&quot; (of unclear etymology; either Latin &#x27;, meaning &quot;sacrifice&quot; or &quot;sacrificial bread,&quot; or German &#x27; for loaf or German for life, &#x27;). Pepper is also referenced in regional names like Norwegian &#x27; or Czech &#x27; (originally &quot;peprník&quot;).

The meaning of &quot;gingerbread&quot; has evolved over time. For centuries the term referred to a traditional European pastry, very like a modern cookie, traditionally used to make gingerbread men. In the United States the first known recipe for &quot;Soft gingerbread to be baked in pans&quot; is found in Amelia Simmons&#x27; 1796 cookbook, &quot;American Cookery&quot;.

==History==
Gingerbread is claimed to have been brought to Europe in 992 AD by the Armenian monk Gregory of Nicopolis (also called Gregory Makar and Grégoire de Nicopolis). He left Nicopolis (in modern-day western Greece) to live in Bondaroy (north-central France), near the town of Pithiviers. He stayed there for seven years until he died in 999 and taught gingerbread baking to French Christians. It may have been brought to Western Europe from the eastern Mediterranean in the 11th century.

Since the 13th century, Toruń gingerbread was made in Toruń, then State of the Teutonic Order (now Poland). It gained fame in the realm and abroad when it was brought to Sweden by German immigrants. In 15th-century Germany, a gingerbread guild controlled production. Early references from the Vadstena Abbey show that the Swedish nuns baked gingerbread to ease indigestion in 1444. It was the custom to bake white biscuits and paint them as window decorations. In England, gingerbread was also thought to have medicinal properties. 16th-century writer John Baret described gingerbread as &quot;a kinde of cake or paste made to comfort the stomacke.&quot;

Gingerbread was a popular treat at medieval European festivals and fairs, and there were even dedicated gingerbread fairs.

The first documented trade of gingerbread biscuits in England dates to the 16th century, where they were sold in monasteries, pharmacies, and town square farmers&#x27; markets. One hundred years later, the town of Market Drayton in Shropshire became known for its gingerbread, as is displayed on their town&#x27;s welcome sign, stating that it is the &quot;home of gingerbread&quot;. The first recorded mention of gingerbread being baked in the town dates to 1793, although it was probably made earlier, as ginger had been stocked in high street businesses since the 1640s. Gingerbread became widely available in the 18th century.

Gingerbread came to the Americas with settlers from Europe. Molasses, less expensive than sugar, soon became a common ingredient and produced a softer cake. The first printed American cookbook, &quot;American Cookery&quot; by Amelia Simmons, contained seven different recipes for gingerbread. Her recipe for &quot;Soft gingerbread to be baked in pans&quot; is the first written recipe for the cakey old-fashioned American gingerbread.

==Varieties==

=== England and Scotland ===

In England, gingerbread may refer to a cake, or type of biscuit made with ginger. In the biscuit form, it commonly takes the form of a gingerbread man. Gingerbread men were first attributed to the court of Queen Elizabeth I, who served the figurines to foreign dignitaries. Today, however, they are generally served around Christmas. Gingerbread was a traditional confectionery sold at popular fairs, often given as a treat or token of affection to children and lovers &quot;sweethearts&quot; and known as a &quot;fairing&quot; of gingerbread – the name retained now only by Cornish fairings. This crisp brittle type of gingerbread is now represented by the popular commercial version called the ginger nut biscuit.

&quot;Parliament cake&quot; or &quot;Parlies&quot;, a very spicy ginger shortbread, were eaten (in the same way as salty snacks with beer), with whisky, rum or brandy, during midday breaks, by the members of the original (pre-1707) Scottish Parliament, in a secret backroom (&quot;ben the hoose&quot;), at a tavern and shop in Bristo Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s Potterrow, behind the university, run by a Mrs Flockhart, AKA &quot;Luckie Fykie&quot;, the landlady who is thought to be the inspiration for Mrs Flockhart in Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Waverley&quot;. The recipe is mentioned in Christian Isobel Johnstone&#x27;s &quot;The Cook and Housewife&#x27;s Manual&quot; (also known as Meg Dod&#x27;s Cookery) (1826) published under the pseudonym of &quot;Mrs. Margaret Dods, of the Cleikum Inn, Saint Ronan&#x27;s&quot;, evoking the character of Margaret Dods, the hostess of the Cleikum Inn in Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Saint Ronan&#x27;s Well&quot; (1823). It was immensely popular, and in which, she used characters Scott&#x27;s to give commentary on preparing national specialties.

Parkin is a form of soft gingerbread cake made with oatmeal and treacle which is popular in northern England, originating in Yorkshire.

=== Americas ===

In the United States, this form of gingerbread is sometimes called &quot;gingerbread cake&quot; or &quot;ginger cake&quot; to distinguish it from the harder forms. French pain d&#x27;épices is somewhat similar, though generally slightly drier, and involves honey rather than treacle and uses less spice than other breads in this category.

In Panama, a confection named &quot;yiyinbre&quot; is a gingerbread cake made with ginger and molasses; it is typical of the region of Chiriquí. Another popular confection is &quot;quequi&quot; or &quot;queque&quot;, a chewy biscuit made with ginger, molasses, and coconut.

In Brazil, &quot;Pão de Mel&quot;, literally meaning honey bread, is a popular treat; it consists in a type of gingerbread made with honey and other spices in small circles with a chocolate covering and can be found traditionally filled with doce de leite.

=== Europe ===
In Germany gingerbread is made in two forms: a soft form called Lebkuchen and a harder form, particularly associated with carnivals and street markets such as the Christmas markets that occur in many German towns. The hard gingerbread is made in decorative shapes, which are then further decorated with sweets and icing. The tradition of cutting gingerbread into shapes takes many other forms and exists in many countries, a well-known example being the gingerbread man. Traditionally, these were dunked in port wine.

At Oktoberfest in Munich, it is customary for men to buy large gingerbread cookies in the shape of a heart, with a ribbon for their sweetheart to wear around their neck. The cookies are iced with romantic phrases like &quot;&quot; (I love you).

In Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, the honey cake eaten at Rosh Hashanah (New Year) closely resembles the Dutch &quot;peperkoek&quot; or the German &quot;Lebkuchen&quot;, though it has wide regional variations.

In Switzerland, a gingerbread confection known as &quot;biber&quot; is typically a two-centimeter (approximately ¾ of an inch) thick rectangular gingerbread cake with a marzipan filling. The cantons of Appenzell and St. Gallen is famous for biber, which are artfully adorned with images of the Appenzell bear or the St. Gallen cathedral respectively by engraving or icing.

In the Netherlands and Belgium, a soft and crumbly gingerbread called &quot;peperkoek&quot;, &quot;kruidkoek&quot; or &quot;ontbijtkoek&quot; is popularly served at breakfast time or during the day, thickly sliced and often topped with butter.

In the Nordic and Baltic countries, the most popular form of ginger confection is the &quot;pepperkaker&quot; (Norwegian), &quot;pepparkakor&quot; (Swedish), &quot;peberkager&quot; (Danish), &quot;piparkökur&quot; (Icelandic), &quot;piparkakut&quot; (Finnish), &quot;piparkūkas&quot; (Latvian) or &quot;piparkoogid&quot; (Estonian). They are thin, brittle biscuits that are particularly associated with the extended Christmas period. In Norway and Sweden, pepperkaker/pepparkakor are also used as window decorations (the pepperkaker/pepparkakor are a little thicker than usual and are decorated with glaze and candy). Many families bake pepperkaker/pepparkakor/brunkager as a tradition.In Russia, a gingerbread maker was first mentioned in Kazan cadastres in 1568. Gingerbread confections are called &quot;pryaniki&quot; (sg. &quot;pryanik&quot;), derived from the Russian term for &#x27;spices&#x27;. Historically three main centers of gingerbread production have developed in the cities of Vyazma, Gorodets, and Tula. Gingerbreads from Tver, Saint Petersburg, and Moscow were also well known in the Russian Empire. A classic Russian gingerbread is made with rye flour, honey, sugar, butter, eggs and various spices; it has an embossed ornament and/or text on the front side with royal icing. A Russian gingerbread can also be shaped in various forms and stuffed with varenje and other sweet fillings.In Poland, gingerbreads are known as &quot;pierniki&quot; (singular: piernik). Some cities have traditional regional styles. Toruń gingerbread (&quot;piernik toruński&quot;) is a traditional Polish gingerbread that has been produced since the Middle Ages in the city of Toruń. It was a favorite delicacy of Chopin when he visited his godfather, Fryderyk Florian Skarbek, in Toruń during school vacation. Kraków gingerbread is the traditional style of the former Polish capital.

In the Czech Republic, gingerbread is called &#x27; and it is a popular Christmas biscuit and a decoration. Common shapes include hearts, stars and animals and gingerbread houses are also popular. Towns associated with &#x27; include Pardubice and Miletín.

In Romania, gingerbread is called &quot;turtă dulce&quot; and usually has sugar glazing.

A variety of gingerbread in Bulgaria is known as &quot;меденка&quot; (&quot;made of honey&quot;). Traditionally the cookie is as big as the palm of a hand, round and flat, and with a thin layer of chocolate. Other common ingredients include honey, cinnamon, ginger, and dried clove.
In Ukraine, &quot;medivnyk&quot; (&quot;made of honey&quot;) means either dry honey cookie (a &quot;prianyk&quot;, also called &quot;medyanyk&quot;) or a spongy honey cake (a fruitcake). &quot;Mykolaychyky&quot; are traditional Western Ukrainian cookies or gingerbread that are baked for St. Nicholas Day and given to children. &quot;Panyanky&quot; usually baked for Christmass eve in Eastern Ukraine. They are pink because they are colored with beet juice.

<doc id="729783" wikidata="Q1285026" url="?curid=729783" title="Egghead">
<text>In U.S. English slang, egghead is an epithet used to refer to intellectuals or people considered out-of-touch with ordinary people and lacking in realism, common sense, sexual interests, etc. on account of their intellectual interests. A similar, though not necessarily pejorative, British term is &quot;boffin&quot;. The term &quot;egghead&quot; reached its peak currency during the 1950s, when vice-presidential candidate Richard Nixon used it against Democratic Presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson. It was used by Bill Clinton advisor Paul Begala in the 2008 presidential campaign to describe Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s supporters when he said, &quot;Obama can&#x27;t win with just the eggheads and African-Americans.&quot;

== Origins ==
In his Pulitzer Prize-winning historical essay on U.S. anti-intellectualism, historian Richard Hofstadter wrote: &quot;During the campaign of 1952, the country seemed to be in need of some term to express that disdain for intellectuals which had by then become a self-conscious motif in U.S. politics. The word &quot;egghead&quot; was originally used without invidious associations, but quickly assumed them, and acquired a much sharper tone than the traditional &quot;highbrow&quot;. Shortly after the campaign was over, Louis Bromfield, a popular novelist of right-wing political persuasion, suggested that the word might someday find its way into dictionaries as follows:

&quot;Egghead:&quot; A person of spurious intellectual pretensions, often a professor or the protégé of a professor. Essentially confused in thought and immersed in mixture of sentimentality and violent evangelism. A doctrinaire supporter of Middle-European socialism as opposed to Greco-French-U.S. ideas of democracy and liberalism. Subject to the old-fashioned philosophical morality of Nietzsche which frequently leads him into jail or disgrace. A self-conscious prig, so given to examining all sides of a question that he becomes thoroughly addled while remaining always in the same spot. An anemic bleeding heart.

In their &quot;Dictionary of American Slang&quot; (1960; 2nd supplemented ed. 1975), Harold Wentworth and Stuart Berg Flexner cite two earlier meanings of &quot;egghead&quot;, one referring to baldness, the other to stupidity. Wentworth and Flexner note that the meaning under discussion here was &quot;[p]op. during presidential campaign of 1952 when the supporters of Adlai Stevenson, Democratic candidate, were called eggheads. Thus orig. the term carried the connotation of &#x27;politically minded&#x27; and &#x27;liberal&#x27;; today its application is more general. May have originated in ref. to the high forehead of Mr. Stevenson or of the pop. image of an academician&quot; (p. 171).

Philip K. Dick claimed in a 1977 interview that, while researching his Nazi-themed novel &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, he discovered that an equivalent term (&quot;Eierkopf&quot;) had been used by the Sturmabteilung because &quot;when they attacked people who were defenseless, [...] their skulls cracked readily against the pavement&quot;.

<text>The West Farms Square–East Tremont Avenue station (formerly the 177th Street station) is a local station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of East Tremont Avenue and Boston Road in the West Farms neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the train at all times, and the train at all times except late nights and rush hours in the peak direction.

==History==
The initial segment of the IRT White Plains Road Line opened on November 26, 1904 between 180th Street–Bronx Park and Jackson Avenue. Initially, trains on the line were served by elevated trains from the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line. Once the connection to the IRT Lenox Avenue Line opened on July 10, 1905, trains from the newly opened IRT subway ran via the line.

In Fiscal Year 1909, the installation of an escalator at the station was authorized.

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The northbound platform at the 177th Street station was extended to the rear, while the southbound platform was not lengthened. On January 23, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the White Plains Road Line.

The New York State Transit Commission announced plans to extend the southbound platforms at seven stations on the line from Jackson Avenue to 177th Street to accommodate ten-car trains for $81,900 on August 8, 1934. The platform at 177th Street would be lengthened from to .

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The Bergen Avenue cutoff, which allowed Third Avenue trains to access the White Plains Road Line, was abandoned on November 5, 1946, as part of the gradual curtailment of elevated service on the IRT Third Avenue Line. On June 13, 1949, the platform extensions at this station, as well as those on White Plains Road Line stations south to Jackson Avenue, opened. The platforms were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to open their doors. Previously the stations could only accommodate six-car local trains.

On November 1, 1951, a contract for the construction of a mezzanine was awarded to Amdor Structures Incorporated. The mezzanine connected the subway station with a new escalator in Boston Road near the Bronx Zoo.

As part of its 2025–2029 Capital Program, the MTA has proposed making the station wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 

==Station layout==
This elevated station, situated on a high curve, one of the highest elevations on the line, has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the 5 train during rush hours in peak direction. The northbound platform is longer than the southbound one and can fit about 12 cars.

Both platforms have beige windscreens with green frames and outlines and green canopies with red roofs on their northern half and gray, waist-high, steel fences with lampposts at regular intervals on their southern half. The station name signs are in the standard black name plate in white lettering.

The 2004 artwork here is called &quot;Animal Tracks&quot; by Naomi Andrée Campbell. It consists of in 13 faceted glass murals on the platform windscreens depicting images related to the Bronx Zoo, which is several blocks to the north.

Just north of the station are the abandoned trackways to 180th Street–Bronx Park, the original terminal of the White Plains Road Line.

===Exits===
This station has two elevated station houses below the platforms and tracks. The full-time one is at the center. Two staircases from each platform go down to a crossunder, where doors lead to a waiting area. Outside the turnstile bank that provides access to and from the station, there is a token booth, two staircases going down to the northeast corner of East Tremont Avenue and Boston Road, and one staircase and one enclosed escalator going down to the northwest corner. The station&#x27;s other station house at the north end is unstaffed, containing one staircase from the northwest corner of East 178th Street and Boston Road, a set of High Entry-Exit Turnstiles, and two staircases to each platform.

<text>The Ritz Dakota Digital was a type of point-and-shoot digital camera, introduced in July 2003, designed by Pure Digital Technologies and sold by the Ritz Camera Centers. It had a digital photo resolution of 1.2 megapixels (1280 pixels wide, 960 pixels high) and a storage capacity of 25 pictures.

==Original model==
When introduced, the Dakota Digital sparked massive interest, primarily due to its price tag: US$10.99. At the time, a digital camera of similar low-end resolution and functionality was in the $40–$70 range. The reason for the low price was that the Dakota Digital was a &quot;single-use camera&quot;, i.e. the consumer takes the pictures, returns the camera to the store, and the pictures are returned to the consumer in print and CD-ROM format (after an additional $11 processing fee) while the camera is refurbished and resold. The Dakota Digital wasn&#x27;t the very first digital camera introduced as a single-use concept camera - Pentax did it in Japan two years before with the &quot;Tottemo EG&quot;. However, it was the first single-use digital camera to be mass-marketed (the Pentax/Sanyo camera was only a three-month trial run), as well as the first single-use digital camera sold in the United States.

Almost immediately after introduction, several people began work on hacking the single-use Dakota Digital in attempts to transform it into what would be the least expensive reusable digital camera available at the time. In November 2003, only four months after it was introduced, they succeeded in this task. Technical details about the internal components were publicly posted on the Internet, along with instructions for creating various compatible link cables that connected the Dakota Digital to home personal computers. In addition to this, special third-party software provided a way to download pictures and clear the camera&#x27;s internal flash memory to allow more pictures to be taken. The technical data, instructions and software met all requirements to make the Dakota Digital reusable.

Public announcement of how to transform the single-use camera into a reusable camera, paired with the very low camera price, immediately created high demand for the Dakota Digital. So Ritz began pulling the Dakota Digital out of its stores after learning of the hack, and the original camera soon became difficult to find.

In July 2004, a group of hackers made available methods to further improve the original Dakota Digital by upgrading the camera&#x27;s firmware, or internal programming. These firmware upgrades added several new features, most notably the ability to adjust or remove the original 25 picture limit, along with various other changes and improvements.

A few months after the original camera was pulled off the shelves, Ritz introduced two new models of Dakota Digital, the &quot;PV2&quot; series. One was similar to the original model with a price of $10.99, while the other, priced at $18.99, contained a color LCD screen that displayed the most recent picture taken. Both were based on an entirely new chipset manufactured by SMaL Camera Technologies. Hacking of this camera has been more of a group effort than the first. John Maushammer removed and read the flash memory chip, wrote a disassembler, and commented significant portions of the firmware. Others investigated the USB interface, and John figured out the authentication mechanism and how to disable it. Others figured out how to download the images using modified versions of software for SMaL&#x27;s other cameras, and other people are reverse-engineering the proprietary RAW file format.
The security mechanism on the original camera consisted of a challenge and response. The challenge was the camera&#x27;s serial number, and the response was the 4-byte result of a simple hash function – the serial number converted from ASCII to binary-coded decimal, negated bitwise, and multiplied by 4. The weakness was that the hash function was stored in the firmware, so it could be completely understood and replicated. The PV2 used a better challenge and response mechanism. It was better not because it used a longer key (128 byte challenge, 128 byte response), but because the hash function was not stored algorithmically in firmware. Theoretically, the response could not be mathematically related to the challenge and the only correlation between the two could be a record saved in the manufacturer&#x27;s database (which authorized processing systems would have to access to read pictures from the camera). In practice, though, only a few challenge/response pairs have been seen in the wild.
==Legacy==

After their experience with the Dakota models, Pure Digital Technologies partnered with CVS to produce a &quot;disposable&quot; video camera, which in turn formed the basis for the successful Flip Video series of entry-level digital video cameras.
