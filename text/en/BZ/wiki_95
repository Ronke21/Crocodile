<text>The Fellowship is the label given to a group of people within the Presbyterian Church of Australia. Located in Melbourne, it was estimated to involve between 300 and 400 people. The Fellowship has been labelled as a &quot;secretive cult&quot;.
==History==
The Fellowship was started by Ronald Grant and Alan Neil, who had both served as missionaries with the South Seas Evangelical Mission in the Solomon Islands. While missionaries, both were profoundly influenced by widespread experiences of &quot;the conviction of sin and deliverance from demons&quot; during their participation in a revival in the Solomon Islands. Dissatisfied with perceived persecution from evangelical circles following their requested resignation due to &quot;doctrinal differences&quot; the pair started house meetings in their homes in the late 1930s. Communicants of these meetings would later be labelled as members of &quot;The Fellowship&quot;.

Alan Neil died in the late 1960s, and Ronald Grant was involved in the group until his death in 1995. During the following year, members left their current churches and joined one of three Presbyterian churches: Clayton, Mount Evelyn and Camberwell, reportedly at the direction of the Fellowship. In 2002, people accused of being in the Fellowship were removed from membership of the Mount Evelyn church.

==Characteristics==
The Fellowship is strongly opposed to Freemasonry. A theory of &quot;generational curses&quot; is taught, which encourages repentance if a member&#x27;s ancestors were Freemasons.

The Fellowship emphasises the importance of what it calls &quot;walking in the light&quot;, referencing 1 John 1:7. In the context of The Fellowship, &quot;walking in the light&quot; means the public confession of sin to one another and being completely transparent with others to keep one another accountable. The doctrine argues that God&#x27;s forgiveness &quot;depends&quot; upon such public confession of sin.

Stuart Piggin suggests that they combined &quot;remnant&quot; and &quot;revival&quot; mentalities, and that occasional visitors to their meetings &quot;have been impressed by the Christian calibre of those who attended and could not fault the Scriptural teaching.&quot; 

==Criticism==
The Fellowship has been widely criticised for causing relationship breakdowns between Fellowship members and their families and &quot;shunning&quot; members who leave the group. There are many testimonies of ex-Fellowship members being cut off from family members, some unable to see their grandchildren, and examples of Fellowship people refusing to attend funerals of non-Fellowship family members. While it appears that these relationships have been mending outwardly (with the example of many grandparents being reunited with grandchildren), the group continues to deny wrongdoing. &quot;Fractured Fellowship: A Presbyterian Case Study&quot; makes this case based on primary sources, including private letters, that have never been published.

==Actions by the Presbyterian Church==
In February 2006, the Presbytery of Melbourne East excommunicated all 15 elders of the Camberwell congregation because of their handling of a complaint of emotional abuse against an elder.

This decision was appealed to the State Assembly, which upheld the decision of the Presbytery at its meeting in October 2006. Some members of the Victorian Assembly then appealed the decision to the General Assembly of Australia on the grounds that the Victorian Church had set up its own processes for discipline rather than operating under the General Assembly&#x27;s Code as required and that the decision of the Victorian Assembly was made based on information that was not available to the Presbytery of East Melbourne when making its original decision, against its own process of discipline.

These appeals were upheld by the General Assembly of Australia at its Commission in August 2007. The clerk of the General Assembly, Dr Paul Logan, said that many felt that natural justice had been denied by the processes used. As a result of this decision the elders were reinstated.

The General Assembly of Australia established a committee to investigate material published about The Fellowship, including allegations of errors in doctrine and behaviour, promising to re-hear complaints.

The Victorian State Assembly was instructed by the General Assembly of Australia to take several actions including withdrawing from publication &quot;Fractured Fellowship&quot; and temporarily moving the parish of Camberwell from the Presbytery of Melbourne East to the Presbytery of Melbourne West until the matter could be settled. At its Commission in May 2008 the Victorian Assembly handled the private report of the committee of the General Assembly in public session, rejecting its instructions to retry the matter. Rev. Douglas Robertson from Scots&#x27; Church in Melbourne, who at the same meeting was elected the next Moderator of the Victorian Assembly, accused the General Assembly of Australia of censorship and unconstitutionally exceeding its authority.

<text>Hypogonadism means diminished functional activity of the gonads—the testicles or the ovaries—that may result in diminished production of sex hormones. Low androgen (e.g., testosterone) levels are referred to as hypoandrogenism and low estrogen (e.g., estradiol) as hypoestrogenism. These are responsible for the observed signs and symptoms in both males and females.

Hypogonadism, commonly referred to by the symptom &quot;low testosterone&quot; or &quot;Low T&quot;, can also decrease other hormones secreted by the gonads including progesterone, DHEA, anti-Müllerian hormone, activin, and inhibin. Sperm development (spermatogenesis) and release of the egg from the ovaries (ovulation) may be impaired by hypogonadism, which, depending on the degree of severity, may result in partial or complete infertility.

In January 2020, the American College of Physicians issued clinical guidelines for testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low levels of testosterone. The guidelines are supported by the American Academy of Family Physicians. The guidelines include patient discussions regarding testosterone treatment for sexual dysfunction; annual patient evaluation regarding possible notable improvement and, if none, to discontinue testosterone treatment; physicians should consider intramuscular treatments, rather than transdermal treatments, due to costs and since the effectiveness and harm of either method is similar; and, testosterone treatment for reasons other than possible improvement of sexual dysfunction may not be recommended.
==Classification==
Deficiency of sex hormones can result in defective primary or secondary sexual development, or withdrawal effects (e.g., premature menopause) in adults. Defective egg or sperm development results in infertility. The term hypogonadism usually means permanent rather than transient or reversible defects, and usually implies deficiency of reproductive hormones, with or without fertility defects. The term is less commonly used for infertility without hormone deficiency. There are many possible types of hypogonadism and several ways to categorize them. Hypogonadism is also categorized by endocrinologists by the level of the reproductive system that is defective. Physicians measure gonadotropins (LH and FSH) to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism. In primary hypogonadism the LH and/or FSH are usually elevated, meaning the problem is in the testicles (hyper-gonatropic hypogonadism); whereas in secondary hypogonadism, both are normal or low, suggesting the problem is in the brain (hypo-gonatropic hypogonadism).

===Affected system===
* Hypogonadism resulting from defects of the gonads is referred to as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or primary hypogonadism. Examples include Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome. Mumps is known to cause testicular failure, and in recent years has been immunized against in the US. A varicocele can reduce hormonal production as well.
* Hypogonadism resulting from hypothalamic or pituitary defects is termed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), secondary hypogonadism, or central hypogonadism (referring to the central nervous system).
** Examples of hypothalamic defects include Kallmann syndrome.
** Examples of pituitary defects include hypopituitarism and pituitary hypoplasia.
** An example of hypogonadism resulting from the lack of hormone response is androgen insensitivity syndrome, where there are inadequate receptors to bind the testosterone, resulting in varying clinical phenotypes of sexual characteristics despite XY chromosomes.
** Isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), also called idiopathic or congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) as well as isolated or congenital gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (IGD) accounts for a small subset of cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) due to deficiency in or insensitivity to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) where the function and anatomy of the anterior pituitary are otherwise normal and secondary causes of HH are not present.

===Primary or secondary===
* Primary defect is inherent within the gonad: e.g. Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome (45X,0), Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY), XY with SRY gene-immunity
* Secondary defect lies outside of the gonad: e.g. Polycystic ovary syndrome, and Kallmann syndrome, also called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Hemochromatosis and diabetes mellitus can be causes of this as well.

===Congenital vs. acquired===
* Examples of congenital causes of hypogonadism, that is, causes that are present at birth:
** Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome. It is also one of the signs of CHARGE syndrome.
* Examples of acquired causes of hypogonadism:
** Opioid-induced androgen deficiency (resulting from the prolonged use of opioid-class medications, e.g. codeine, Dihydrocodeine, morphine, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, hydromorphone, etc.)
** Anabolic steroid-induced hypogonadism (ASIH)
** Childhood mumps
** Children born to mothers who had ingested the endocrine disruptor diethylstilbestrol for potential miscarriage
** Traumatic brain injury, even in childhood
** In males, normal aging causes a decrease in androgens, which is sometimes called &quot;male menopause&quot; (also known by the coinage &quot;manopause&quot;), late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), and &quot;andropause&quot; or androgen decline in the aging male (ADAM), among other names.
** It is a symptom of hereditary hemochromatosis

===Hormones vs. fertility===
Hypogonadism can involve just hormone production or just fertility, but most commonly involves both.
* Examples of hypogonadism that affect hormone production more than fertility are hypopituitarism and Kallmann syndrome; in both cases, fertility is reduced until hormones are replaced but can be achieved solely with hormone replacement.
* Examples of hypogonadism that affect fertility more than hormone production are Klinefelter syndrome and Kartagener syndrome.

===Other===
Hypogonadism can occur in other conditions, like Prader–Willi syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==
Women with hypogonadism do not begin menstruating and it may affect their height and breast development. Onset in women after puberty causes cessation of menstruation, lowered libido, loss of body hair, and hot flashes. In men, it causes impaired muscle and body hair development, gynecomastia, decreased height, erectile dysfunction, and sexual difficulties. If hypogonadism is caused by a disorder of the central nervous system (e.g., a brain tumor), then this is known as central hypogonadism. Signs and symptoms of central hypogonadism may involve headaches, impaired vision, double vision, milky discharge from the breast, and symptoms caused by other hormone problems.

===Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism===
The symptoms of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, a subtype of hypogonadism, include late, incomplete, or lack of development at puberty, and sometimes short stature or the inability to smell; in females, a lack of breasts and menstrual periods, and in males a lack of sexual development, e.g., facial hair, penis, and testes enlargement, deepening voice.

==Diagnosis==

===Women===
Testing serum LH and FSH levels are often used to assess hypogonadism in women, particularly when menopause is believed to be happening. These levels change during a woman&#x27;s normal menstrual cycle, so the history of having ceased menstruation coupled with high levels aids the diagnosis of being menopausal. Commonly, the post-menopausal woman is not called hypogonadal if she is of typical menopausal age. Contrast with a young woman or teen, who would have hypogonadism rather than menopause. This is because hypogonadism is an abnormality, whereas menopause is a normal change in hormone levels. In any case, the LH and FSH levels will rise in cases of primary hypogonadism or menopause, while they will be low in women with secondary or tertiary hypogonadism.

Hypogonadism is often discovered during the evaluation of delayed puberty, but ordinary delay, which eventually results in normal pubertal development, wherein reproductive function is termed constitutional delay. It may be discovered during an infertility evaluation in either men or women.

===Men===
Low testosterone can be identified through a simple blood test performed by a laboratory, ordered by a health care provider. Blood for the test must be taken in the morning hours, when levels are highest, as levels can drop by as much as 13% during the day and all normal reference ranges are based on morning levels.

Normal total testosterone levels depend on the man&#x27;s age but generally range from 240 to 950 ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter) or 8.3–32.9 nmol/L (nanomoles per liter). According to American Urological Association, the diagnosis of low testosterone can be supported when the total testosterone level is below 300 ng/dl. Some men with normal total testosterone have low free or bioavailable testosterone levels which could still account for their symptoms. Men with low serum testosterone levels should have other hormones checked, particularly luteinizing hormone to help determine why their testosterone levels are low and help choose the most appropriate treatment (most notably, testosterone is usually not appropriate for secondary or tertiary forms of male hypogonadism, in which the LH levels are usually reduced).

Treatment is often prescribed for total testosterone levels below 230 ng/dL with symptoms. If the serum total testosterone level is between 230 and 350 ng/dL, free or bioavailable testosterone should be checked as they are frequently low when the total is marginal.

The standard range given is based on widely varying ages and, given that testosterone levels naturally decrease as humans age, age-group specific averages should be taken into consideration when discussing treatment between doctor and patient. In men, testosterone falls approximately 1 to 3 percent each year.

;Blood testing
A position statement by the Endocrine Society expressed dissatisfaction with most assays for total, free, and bioavailable testosterone. In particular, research has questioned the validity of commonly administered assays of free testosterone by radioimmunoassay. The free androgen index, essentially a calculation based on total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels, is the worst predictor of free testosterone levels and should not be used. Measurement by equilibrium dialysis or mass spectroscopy is generally required for accurate results, particularly for free testosterone which is normally present in very small concentrations.

==Screening==
Screening males who do not have symptoms of hypogonadism is not recommended as of 2018.

==Treatment==
Male primary or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is often treated with testosterone replacement therapy if they are not trying to conceive.

In short- and medium-term testosterone replacement therapy the risk of cardiovascular events (including strokes and heart attacks and other heart diseases) is not increased. The long-term safety of the therapy is not known yet. Side effects can include an elevation of hematocrit to levels that require blood withdrawal (phlebotomy) to prevent complications from excessively thick blood. Gynecomastia (growth of breasts in men) sometimes occurs. Finally, some physicians worry that obstructive sleep apnea may worsen with testosterone therapy, and should be monitored.

While historically, men with prostate cancer risk were warned against testosterone therapy, that has shown to be a myth.

Another treatment for hypogonadism is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This stimulates the LH receptor, thereby promoting testosterone synthesis. This will not be effective in men whose testes simply cannot synthesize testosterone anymore (primary hypogonadism), and the failure of hCG therapy is further support for the existence of true testicular failure in a patient. It is particularly indicated in men with hypogonadism who wish to retain their fertility, as it does not suppress spermatogenesis (sperm production) as testosterone replacement therapy does.

For both men and women, an alternative to testosterone replacement is low-dose clomifene treatment, which can stimulate the body to naturally increase hormone levels while avoiding infertility and other side effects that can result from direct hormone replacement therapy. Clomifene blocks estrogen from binding to some estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, thereby causing an increased release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and subsequently LH from the pituitary. Clomifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Generally, clomifene does not have adverse effects at the doses used for this purpose.

<text>Gertrude Madeline &quot;Trudy&quot; Marshall (February 14, 1920 – May 23, 2004) was an American actress and model.

== Early life ==
Marshall was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Madeline (née Brennan) and Frederick Marshall. She graduated from Floral Park Memorial High School.

== Career ==
A popular magazine cigarette girl during her modeling days for Harry Conover, Marshall was at different times &quot;The Old Gold Girl&quot;, &quot;The Chesterfield Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Lucky Strike Girl&quot;.

Marshall was signed by 20th Century-Fox in 1942 and groomed in bit parts. In &quot;The Dancing Masters&quot; (1943) she was female lead to Laurel and Hardy. She next played a featured role in the World War II war drama &quot;The Fighting Sullivans&quot; (1944), the true story of a family that lost all five enlisted sons in the sinking of the USS &quot;Juneau&quot; off Guadalcanal in November 1942. Marshall played the surviving sister Genevieve.

Taking roles as a decorative ingenue for a time, Marshall later played the &quot;other woman&quot; in a few features. Semi-retired by the 1960s, she returned very infrequently to Hollywood. She appeared in the movie &quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot; (1975) with her daughter Deborah Raffin. Marshall was the hostess of her own radio and TV show in the 1980s in which she interviewed stars who attended special Hollywood events. 

== Personal life ==
In 1944, Marshall married businessman Phillip Raffin, with whom she had three children, including model and actress Deborah Raffin. They remained together until his death in 1981.

== Death ==
On May 23, 2004, Marshall died at age 84 in her Century City, Los Angeles, home. She is interred in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

<text>Christian Rosha Hosoi ( ; born October 5, 1967) is an American professional skateboarder. He is also known by the nicknames &quot;Christ&quot; and &quot;Holmes&quot;.

==Early life==
Hosoi was born on October 5, 1967, to a father of Japanese descent from Hawaii, and a mother of European and American descent. He grew up in Los Angeles and Hawaii.

==Skateboard career==
Hosoi started skating at seven or eight years old with veterans such as Shogo Kubo, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, and Jay Adams as his idols. His father, Ivan &quot;Pops&quot; Hosoi became the manager of the Marina Del Rey Skatepark, and Christian quit school and spent his time there where he developed his skill.

In 1979, as an amateur, Hosoi was sponsored by Powell Peralta. He left Powell Peralta a year later when they would not allow him to turn professional and joined Dogtown Skateboards. Shortly thereafter, Dogtown went out of business. Christian turned pro at the age of 14 with Sims Skateboards. After leaving Sims, Hosoi joined Alva Skates with the idea of launching his own company through Alva. Hosoi later claimed that he &quot;almost quit&quot; Alva Skates following an argument over Hosoi&#x27;s allegation that Alva &quot;cheated [Hosoi] out&quot; of the fish-tail board shape, which Hosoi claimed to have conceptualized and shown to Alva.

Hosoi invented the Christ Air and Rocket Air. In 1984, he formed his own company, Hosoi Skates, first distributed through Skull Skates, then through NHS-INC.

When street skating began to emerge in the mid-to-late 1980s, Hosoi showed talent there, winning both the vert and street contests at the Lotte Cup contest in Japan in 1989.

==Incarceration==

Hosoi&#x27;s pro career began to falter as a recession hit the US in the early 1990s and as street skating began to overtake vert in media coverage. Hosoi faced bankruptcy after financial difficulties with a series of failed skateboard companies like Tuff Sk8s, Sk8 Kultur, Milk, and Focus, in addition to a growing addiction to drugs.

In 1995, Hosoi was arrested on two minor offenses, and a warrant for his arrest was issued for failing to appear in court. To avoid arrest, Hosoi stopped attending competitions and demos, including declining an invitation to the first X Games (then the Extreme Games), which was going to be marketed as a renewed rivalry between Tony Hawk and Hosoi.

Hosoi was finally captured in January 2000 at the Honolulu airport. He was apprehended while attempting to transport nearly of crystal methamphetamine from Los Angeles to Honolulu.
He was charged with trafficking with the intent to distribute. He was sentenced to ten years&#x27; incarceration, of which he served four and was released from the San Bernardino Central Detention Center in June 2004.

==Personal life==

Hosoi is married to former nightclub dancer Jennifer Lee and has four sons, James Hosoi, Rhythm Hosoi (from a previous relationship), Classic Hosoi and Endless Hosoi.

===Christianity===
Hosoi became a born-again Christian through the urging of his wife and her uncle, Pastor Christopher Swaim. He also earned his high school diploma.
Hosoi continues to be open about his new-found faith, having become ordained as an associate pastor, and has resumed his skateboarding career.

Hosoi was the subject of the 2006 documentary film, &quot;Rising Son&quot;, that detailed his initial success, drug addiction, and conversion to Christianity.

Hosoi joined forces with Jay Haizlip, Brian Sumner, and others to create The Uprising, a skate-based ministry. In 2008, The Uprising was documented by Steelroots, a Christian youth television network, and made into a reality television show. The first season comprised eight episodes and followed the ministry around California and England.

Hosoi also appeared in a testimonial video on I Am Second, in which he shares the story of his faith in Jesus.

Hosoi along with co-author Chris Ahrens released his autobiography book &quot;Hosoi: My Life as a Skateboarder Junkie Inmate Pastor&quot; in 2012 that chronicles his life story and testimony of finding redemption and purpose after reading the Bible and becoming a pastor.

==Video game appearances==
Hosoi is a playable character in the video games &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot; as an unlockable and &quot;Tony Hawk: Ride&quot;.

<doc id="754648" wikidata="Q314030" url="?curid=754648" title="Düsseldorf Panther">
<text>The Düsseldorf Panther are an American football team from Düsseldorf, Germany. The club is the oldest extant American football club in Europe, having been formed on 1 May 1978.

The Panthers are one of the most successful American football clubs in Germany, having won six German Bowls as well as becoming the first-ever German team to win the Eurobowl in 1995. Having won its 18th &quot;Junior Bowl&quot; in 2024, the club has the most successful youth department in the sport in Germany.

== History ==

The Panthers were formed on 1 May 1978 and, while not the first American football club in Germany—this honour going to the Frankfurter Löwen who were formed in 1977 but folded in the mid-1980s—are the oldest still existing club.

In 1979, the &quot;American Football Bundesliga&quot;, later to be renamed the German Football League, was formed, consisting of six clubs, the Düsseldorf Panther, Frankfurter Löwen, Ansbach Grizzlies, Munich Cowboys, Berlin Bears and Bremerhaven Seahawks. Of those six, the top two teams would contest the first ever German Bowl on 10 November 1979, however, the Panthers were a long shot from this game, finishing last without a win or point.

The team did not take part in the second or third season of the league, instead forming a rival league with a number of other clubs. The Panthers won this league, the &quot;Nordwestdeutsche Football-Liga&quot;, the NFL, in 1980 and 1981. Those two titles are however not recognised as national championships and the club, like all others in the league, soon returned to the &quot;Bundesliga&quot;.

From 1982 to 1986, the league stood under the dominance of the Panthers and the Ansbach Grizzlies, who played each other in four consecutive German Bowls, with the Panthers winning all but the 1985 one. The team remained a strong side after this but was only able to win one more championship, in 1988, in the following four years.

After a 1991 season when the club couldn&#x27;t qualify for the play-offs, the Panthers returned to their former strength from 1992 onwards, the club experiencing a second golden era until 1996. Three German championships were won, in 1992, 1994 and 1995. In between, in 1993, the club only reached the semi-finals while in 1996, it lost the final. Additionally, the Panthers became the first German side to win the Eurobowl in 1995. From 1995 onwards, the Panthers also had some local competition, with the Rhein Fire, based at Düsseldorf, playing in the NFL Europe until the league folded in 2007.

From the late 1990s, the club suffered from financial trouble and was unable to maintain its high standard. After three seasons of missing the play-offs altogether, the Panthers reached the semi-finals once more in 2000 and the quarter-finals the year after. The year 2001 however saw the club drop out of the league and, for financial reasons, restart in the tier-three &quot;Regionalliga West&quot;. Success quickly returned, the Panthers won their league and the &quot;2nd Bundesliga&quot; in the following year, returning to the GFL by 2004.

Unlike in the past, the Panthers were not a play-off contender anymore, struggling against relegation instead. In 2004, a fifth place was still enough not to have to enter the relegation round, the following two years this was not the case. The team was unable to win a league match in 2005, but was saved in the relegation round when it defeated the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes there. The following season, its league performance was much improved but it could nevertheless only finish last, faced Kiel again in the relegation round and, this time lost.

The Panthers played four seasons at the second level after that, from 2007 to 2010, finishing in mid-table in the first three. In 2010, a second place entitled the club to play in the promotion round courtesy to the expansion of the GFL from 12 to 14 teams. The Panthers were then able to earn promotion to the GFL by narrowly overcoming the Berlin Rebels by a point on aggregate, winning 43–41 in Berlin and losing 33–34 at home.

The Panther&#x27;s made a successful return to Germany&#x27;s highest league in 2011, finishing third and qualifying for the play-offs where they met and defeated the Marburg Mercenaries in the quarter-finals and advanced to the semi-finals, where they lost to the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes. In 2012, the club came fourth in the northern division of the GFL and qualified for the play-off where it was knocked out by Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns in the quarter-finals. In the 2013 season the club managed to finish only seventh in its division, thereby missing the play-offs. It came seventh again in 2014 and 2015, each time with only seven teams in the league, with only one win in two seasons. In 2016, they placed dead last once more, however this time the league had its full strength of eight teams, meaning a relegation round of Düsseldorf against the Cologne Crocodiles that had placed first in the GFL2 North. They lost relegation sending them down to the GFL2 for two years, before they again returned (overcoming the Hamburg Huskies in the Relegation round, but lost every single game in the 2019 German Football League including the relegation round against the Elmshorn Fighting Pirates. While Covid-19 led to the cancelation of the planned 2020 season, the 2021 season in the North saw the Hildesheim Invaders and the Elmshorn Fighting Pirates try to join the upstart European League of Football and ultimately withdraw their teams from the GFL after talks fell through with the ELF, thus leaving two open spots for the 2022 German Football League. Düsseldorf, having placed second in the 2021 GFL2 season behind the Berlin Adler would be eligible to fill one of those two spots if they so chose.

<text>Irene Manning (born Inez Harvuot, July 17, 1912 – May 28, 2004) was an American actress and singer.

==Biography==
Manning was born as Inez Harvuot on July 17, 1912 in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of five siblings. Both of her parents were singers. Her family loved to go on outdoor picnics where the featured activity was group singing. This family environment helped Irene to develop a keen interest in singing at a very early age. Her sisters later complained that little Irene would sing in her sleep, keeping them awake. Manning trained as an opera singer at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and performed with that city&#x27;s Civic Music Association in 1935.

Manning performed with a four-woman USO show in England and the United States and recorded with Glenn Miller and his Army Air Force Band. Miller was involved in making swing records to be broadcast into Nazi Germany as part of the American Broadcasting System in Europe. Because she had been a light opera star prior to World War II and was fluent in singing in German, she was asked to sing some American pop tunes which had been translated into German vocals. Her sides were some of the last records made by Glenn Miller, prior to his being lost on an ill-fated flight to Paris over the English Channel in December 1944.

She was credited as Hope Manning in her first films, as she broke in with the Republic Studios system in 1936. Her first film placed her as the lead actress in a western, &quot;The Old Corral&quot; (1938), opposite Gene Autry.

By the early 1940s, Irene was employed in the Warner Bros. studio system as a contract actress and singer. She is probably best remembered as diva Fay Templeton in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942), opposite James Cagney. In this film, she had a scene in which she had to simultaneously act, sing the song &quot;Mary&quot;, and play the piano. She starred with Humphrey Bogart in &quot;The Big Shot&quot; (1942) and with Dennis Morgan in both &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1943) and &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot; (1944).

Her contract was picked up by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to place her singing skills as a threat to Jeanette MacDonald, who was giving MGM fits with her difficult demands. In private, Manning claimed that she was a better singer. The problem between MacDonald and MGM subsided, and Manning&#x27;s contract was dropped without any appearances in an MGM film. In all, Irene Manning made a dozen films.

On Broadway, Manning performed in &quot;The Day Before Spring&quot; (1945) and &quot;Susanna, Don&#x27;t You Cry&quot; (1939). She also appeared in &quot;The Dubarry&quot;, &quot;Castle in the Air&quot; and &quot;Serenade&quot; in London. She remained in England and appeared on her own BBC TV show, &quot;An American in England&quot;, until 1951, when she returned to the United States for television and nightclub work. Eventually she retired to teach acting and voice.

== Personal life and death ==
Manning was married four times. In 1944, she married publisher Keith Kolhoff. Her last marriage was to Maxwell W. Hunter II, who designed missiles during the Cold War. They were wed for 37 years until he died in 2001.

Manning died on May 28, 2004, from congestive heart failure at her home in San Carlos, California, at the age of 91. Upon her death, she was cremated with her ashes scattered at sea.

<doc id="754658" wikidata="Q922411" url="?curid=754658" title="Hypopituitarism">
<text>Hypopituitarism is the decreased (&quot;hypo&quot;) secretion of one or more of the eight hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. If there is decreased secretion of one specific pituitary hormone, the condition is known as selective hypopituitarism. If there is decreased secretion of most or all pituitary hormones, the term panhypopituitarism (&quot;pan&quot; meaning &quot;all&quot;) is used.

The signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism vary, depending on which hormones are undersecreted and on the underlying cause of the abnormality. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made by blood tests, but often specific scans and other investigations are needed to find the underlying cause, such as tumors of the pituitary, and the ideal treatment. Most hormones controlled by the secretions of the pituitary can be replaced by tablets or injections. Hypopituitarism is a rare disease, but may be significantly underdiagnosed in people with previous traumatic brain injury. The first description of the condition was made in 1914 by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.

==Signs and symptoms==
The hormones of the pituitary have different actions in the body, and the symptoms of hypopituitarism therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency is more common in people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.

Sometimes, there are additional symptoms that arise from the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism is due to a growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.

Pituitary failure results in many changes in the skin, hair and nails as a result of the absence of pituitary hormone action on these sites.

===Complications===
Several hormone deficiencies associated with hypopituitarism may lead to secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.

===Anterior pituitary===
Deficiency of all anterior pituitary hormones is more common than individual hormone deficiency.

Deficiency of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), together referred to as the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as have decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.

Growth hormone (GH) deficiency leads to a decrease in muscle mass, central obesity (increase in body fat around the waist) and impaired attention and memory. Children experience growth retardation and short stature.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency leads to adrenal insufficiency, a lack of production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol by the adrenal gland. If the problem is chronic, symptoms consist of fatigue, weight loss, failure to thrive (in children), delayed puberty (in adolescents), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), anemia and hyponatremia (low sodium levels). If the onset is abrupt, collapse, shock and vomiting may occur. ACTH deficiency is highly similar to primary Addison&#x27;s disease, which is cortisol deficiency as the result of direct damage to the adrenal glands; the latter form, however, often leads to hyperpigmentation of the skin, which does not occur in ACTH deficiency.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency leads to hypothyroidism (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, as well as a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called &quot;cretinism&quot;.

Prolactin (PRL) plays a role in breastfeeding, and inability to breastfeed may point at abnormally low prolactin levels.

===Posterior pituitary===
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency leads to the syndrome of &quot;diabetes insipidus&quot; (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to polyuria (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.

Oxytocin (OXT) deficiency generally causes few symptoms, however may lead to abnormal social developments due to its complex role as a social neuropeptide.

==Causes==
==Pathophysiology==
The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.

The pituitary develops in the third week of embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke&#x27;s pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke&#x27;s pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors have been found to be deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are &quot;HESX1&quot;, &quot;PROP1&quot;, &quot;POU1F1&quot;, &quot;LHX3&quot;, &quot;LHX4&quot;, &quot;TBX19&quot;, &quot;SOX2&quot; and &quot;SOX3&quot;. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, &quot;POU1F1&quot; (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.
Most of the hormones in the anterior pituitary are each part of an &quot;axis&quot; that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; most of these are stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.

Unless the pituitary damage is being caused by a tumor that overproduces a particular hormone, it is the lack of pituitary hormones that leads to the symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone would indicate the presence of a tumor. The exception to this rule is prolactin: if a tumor compresses the pituitary stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce prolactin, are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess prolactin. Hence, mild elevations in prolactin are attributed to stalk compression. Very high prolactin levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting tumor).

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests are used to confirm the presence of a hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.

Generally, the finding of a combination of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.

===Basal tests===
Levels of LH/FSH may be suppressed by a raised prolactin level, and are therefore not interpretable unless prolactin is low or normal. In men, the combination of low LH and FSH in combination with a low testosterone confirms LH/FSH deficiency; a high testosterone would indicate a source elsewhere in the body (such as a testosterone-secreting tumor). In women, the diagnosis of LH/FSH deficiency depends on whether the woman has been through the menopause. Before the menopause, abnormal menstrual periods together with low estradiol and LH/FSH levels confirm a pituitary problem; after the menopause (when LH/FSH levels are normally elevated and the ovaries produce less estradiol), inappropriately low LH/FSH alone is sufficient. Stimulation tests with GnRH are possible, but their use is not encouraged.

For TSH, basal measurements are usually sufficient, as well as measurements of thyroxine to ensure that the pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful. Prolactin can be measured by basal level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of hypopituitarism or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.

===Stimulation tests===
Growth hormone deficiency is almost certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2 mmol/L. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.

If morning cortisol levels are over 500 nmol/L, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100 and 500 require a stimulation test. This, too, is done with the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough for the purposes of the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.

Symptoms of diabetes insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test to assess the body&#x27;s response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, there is a lack of ADH due to lack of pituitary function (&quot;cranial diabetes insipidus&quot;). In contrast, there is no change if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem (&quot;nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;).

===Further investigations===
If one of these tests shows a deficiency of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary is the first step in identifying an underlying cause. MRI may show various tumors and may assist in delineating other causes. Tumors smaller than 1 cm are referred to as &quot;microadenomas&quot;, and larger lesions are called &quot;macroadenomas&quot;. Computed tomography with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available. Formal visual field testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of optic nerve compression by a tumor.

Other tests that may assist in the diagnosis of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.

==Treatment==
Treatment of hypopituitarism is threefold: removing the underlying cause, treating the hormone deficiencies, and addressing any other repercussions that arise from the hormone deficiencies.

===Underlying cause===
Pituitary tumors require treatment when they are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further as a result of the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.

Prolactinomas may respond to dopamine agonist treatment–medication that mimics the action of dopamine on the lactrotrope cells, usually bromocriptine or cabergoline. This approach may improve pituitary hormone secretion in more than half the cases, and make supplementary treatment unnecessary.

Other specific underlying causes are treated as normally. For example, hemochromatosis is treated by venesection, the regular removal of a fixed amount of blood. Eventually, this decreases the iron levels in the body and improves the function of the organs in which iron has accumulated.

===Hormone replacement===
Most pituitary hormones can be replaced indirectly by administering the products of the effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone can be replaced by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.

Long-term follow up by specialists in endocrinology is generally needed for people with known hypopituitarism. Apart from ensuring the right treatment is being used and at the right doses, this also provides an opportunity to deal with new symptoms and to address complications of treatment.

Difficult situations arise in deficiencies of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in people (both men and women) who experience infertility; infertility in hypopituitarism may be treated with subcutaneous infusions of FSH, human chorionic gonadotropin–which mimics the action of LH–and occasionally GnRH.

==Prognosis==
Several studies have shown that hypopituitarism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.

The largest study to date followed over a thousand people for eight years; it showed an 87% increased risk of death compared to the normal population. Predictors of higher risk were: female sex, absence of treatment for sex hormone deficiency, younger age at the time of diagnosis, and a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma. Apart from cardiovascular disease, this study also showed an increased risk of death from lung disease.

Quality of life may be significantly reduced, even in those people on optimum medical therapy. Many report both physical and psychological problems. It is likely that the commonly used replacement therapies do not completely mimic the natural hormone levels in the body. Health costs remain about double those of the normal population.

Hypopituitarism is usually permanent. It requires lifelong treatment with one or more medicines.

==Epidemiology==
There is only one study that has measured the prevalence (total number of cases in a population) and incidence (annual number of new cases) of hypopituitarism. This study was conducted in Northern Spain and used hospital records in a well-defined population. The study showed that 45.5 people out of 100,000 had been diagnosed with hypopituitarism, with 4.2 new cases per year. 61% were due to tumors of the pituitary gland, 9% due to other types of lesions, and 19% due to other causes; in 11% no cause could be identified.

Recent studies have shown that people with a previous traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.

==History==
The pituitary was known to the ancients, such as Galen, and various theories were proposed about its role in the body, but major clues as to the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when acromegaly due to pituitary tumors was described. The first known report of hypopituitarism was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had had severe puerperal fever eleven years earlier, and subsequently had amenorrhea, weakness, signs of rapid aging, and anemia. The pituitary gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior pituitary. The eponym &quot;Simmonds&#x27; syndrome&quot; is used infrequently for acquired hypopituitarism, especially when cachexia (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of hypopituitarism were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of how common hypopituitarism could be in previous head injury victims.

Until the 1950s, the diagnosis of pituitary disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came with the discovery of radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the pituitary, which as a result of their low concentrations in blood had previously been hard to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH.
 Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.

<text>Frank Belknap Long Jr. (April 27, 1901 – January 3, 1994) was an American writer of horror fiction, fantasy, science fiction, poetry, gothic romance, comic books, and non-fiction. Though his writing career spanned seven decades, he is best known for his horror and science fiction short stories, including contributions to the Cthulhu Mythos alongside his friend, H. P. Lovecraft. During his life, Long received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement (at the 1978 World Fantasy Convention), the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement (in 1987, from the Horror Writers Association), and the First Fandom Hall of Fame Award (1977).

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born in Manhattan, New York City on April 27, 1901. He grew up in the Harlem area of Manhattan. His father was a prosperous dentist and his mother was May Doty. The family resided at 823 West End Avenue in Manhattan. Long&#x27;s father was a keen fisher and hunter, and Long accompanied the family on annual summer vacations from the age of six months to 17, usually in the Thousand Islands region on the Canadian shore, about seven miles from the village of Gananoque. When he was three years old, on one of these vacations, Long fell into the river at the end of a long pier and contracted pneumonia

A lifelong resident of New York City, Long was educated in the New York City public school system. As a boy he was fascinated by natural history, and wrote that he dreamed of running &quot;away from home and explore the great rain forests of the Amazon.&quot; He developed his interest in the weird by reading the Oz books, Jules Verne, and H.G. Wells as well as Ambrose Bierce and Edgar Allan Poe. Though writing was to be his life&#x27;s work, he once commented that as &quot;important as writing is, I could have been completely happy if I had a secure position in a field that has always had a tremendous emotion and an imaginative appeal for me—that of natural history.&quot;

In his late teens, he was active in the United Amateur Press Association (UAPA) in which he won a prize from &quot;The Boy&#x27;s World&quot; (around 1919) and thus discovered amateur journalism. His first published tale was &quot;Dr Whitlock&#x27;s Price (&quot;United Amateur&quot;, March 1920). Long&#x27;s story &quot;The Eye Above the Mantel&quot; (1921), a pastiche of Edgar Allan Poe, in UAPA, caught the eye of H. P. Lovecraft, sparking a friendship and correspondence that would endure until Lovecraft&#x27;s death in 1937.

Long attended New York University from 1920 to 1921, studying journalism but later transferred to Columbia, leaving without a degree. In 1921, he suffered a severe attack of appendicitis, leading to a ruptured appendix and peritonitis. He spent a month in New York&#x27;s Roosevelt Hospital, where he came close to dying. Long&#x27;s brush with death propelled him into a decision that he would leave college to pursue a freelance writing career.

===Early career: the 1920s===

In 1924, at the age of 22, he sold his first short story, &quot;The Desert Lich&quot;, to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine. Throughout the next four decades, Long was to be a frequent contributor to pulp magazines, including two of the most famous: &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (under editor Farnsworth Wright) and &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (under editor John W. Campbell). Long was an active freelance writer, also publishing many non-fiction articles.
His first book, the scarce volume &quot;A Man from Genoa and Other Poems&quot;, was published in 1926 by W. Paul Cook. Two copies are held in the collections of John Hay Library. The poems in this collection won praise from a great variety of writers, among them Arthur Machen, Robinson Jeffers, William Ellery Leonard, John Drinkwater, John Masefield and George Sterling. Samuel Loveman declared that Long&#x27;s poem &quot;The Marriage of Sir John de Mandeville&quot; was worthy of Christopher Marlowe.

Long&#x27;s closest friends (apart from H. P. Lovecraft) in this period included Samuel Loveman, H. Warner Munn, and James F. Morton. He had several encounters with Hart Crane, who lived one flight above Loveman in Brooklyn Heights.

===1930s===

&quot;The Horror from the Hills&quot;, a story serialised in 1931 in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, incorporated almost verbatim a dream H. P. Lovecraft related to him (among other correspondents) in a letter. The short novel was published many years later in separate book form by Arkham House in 1963, as&quot; The Horror from the Hills&quot;.

In the late 1930s, Long turned his hand to science fiction, writing for &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. He also contributed horror stories to &quot;Unknown&quot; (later called &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot;). Long contributed an episode (along with C.L. Moore, Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft) to the round-robin story &quot;The Challenge from Beyond&quot; (1935).

Like &quot;The Man from Genoa and Other Poems&quot;, his second book is a volume of fantastic verse: &quot;The Goblin Tower&quot; (1935), published jointly by H. P. Lovecraft and Robert H. Barlow under Barlow&#x27;s The Dragonfly Press imprint. (A variant edition of this volume was published in 1945 by New Collectors Group - see Bibliography). Published in an edition of only 100 copies, this volume is exceedingly scarce; two copies are held at the collections of the John Hay Library.

=== 1940s===

In pulps such as &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot; and &quot;Startling Stories&quot; during the 1940s, Long sometimes wrote using the pseudonym &quot;Leslie Northern&quot;. What Long characterized as a &quot;minor disability&quot; kept him out of World War II and writing full-time during the early 1940s.

Long reportedly ghost-wrote two, possibly three, of the Ellery Queen Jr novels (mentioned in correspondence with August Derleth) but did not identify the titles. It is believed that the two are &quot;The Black Dog Mystery&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Golden Eagle Mystery&quot; (1942). The third may have been &quot;The Mystery of the Golden Butterfly&quot;, which was never published. (This volume is mentioned as Long&#x27;s on the rear panel of&quot; The Horror from the Hills&quot; and on the rear flap of&quot; The Rim of the Unknown&quot;).

He wrote comic books in the 1940s, including horror stories for &quot;Adventures Into the Unknown&quot; (ACG). Long contributed several original scripts to this comic&#x27;s early issues, as well as an adaptation of Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;. He authored scripts for &quot;Planet Comics&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Congo Bill&quot;, DC&#x27;s Golden Age &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, and the Fawcett Comics &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;. He worked in the 1940s as a script-reader for Twentieth Century Fox Long wrote crime and weird menace stories for &quot;Ten Gang Mystery&quot; and other magazines.

During the 1940s, Long lived for a period in California.

Long credited Theodore Sturgeon, whom he met several times in the mid-1940s, as being instrumental in getting one of his middle-period stories, &quot;A Guest in the House&quot;, produced on CBS-TV in 1954.

In 1946, Arkham House published Long&#x27;s first collection of supernatural fiction,&quot; The Hounds of Tindalos&quot;, which collected 21 of his best tales from the previous twenty years of magazine publication. It featured works which had appeared in such pulps as &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, &quot;Super Science Stories&quot;, Unknown, &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, and others. In &quot;The Man from Time&quot;, a time-traveller from the future has an encounter with writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.

His later science fiction works include the story collection &quot;John Carstairs, Space Detective&quot; (1949) about a &#x27;botanical detective&#x27;, and the novels &quot;Space Station 1&quot; (1957), &quot;Mars is My Destination&quot; (1962) and &quot;It Was the Day of the Robot&quot; (1963).
=== 1950s===

In the 1950s he was involved with editing five different magazines. He was uncredited associate editor on &quot;The Saint Mystery Magazine&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot;. He was associate editor on &quot;Satellite Science Fiction&quot;, 1959; on &quot;Short Stories&quot;, 1959–60; and on &quot;Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine&quot; until 1966.

Long several times met fellow &quot;Weird Tales&quot; writer and poet Joseph Payne Brennan, and later provided the foreword for Brennan&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Lucius Leffing&quot; (1977).

=== 1960s===

After the decline of the pulps, Long moved into the prolific production of science fiction and gothic romance novels during the 1960s and 1970s. He even wrote a &quot;Man from UNCLE&quot; story, &quot;The Electronic Frankenstein Affair&quot;, which appeared under the pen name Robert Hart Davis in the &quot;Man from UNCLE Magazine&quot;.

In 1960, he married Lyda Arco, an artists&#x27; representative and aficionado of drama. She was a Russian descended from a line of actors in the Yiddish theatre who ran a salon in Chelsea, NY. They stayed together till Long&#x27;s death in 1994, but had no children. Long described himself as an &quot;agnostic.&quot; Referring to Lovecraft, Long wrote that he &quot;always shared HPL&#x27;s skepticism . . . concerning the entire range of alleged supernatural occurrences and what is commonly defined as &#x27;the occult.&#x27;&quot;

In 1963 Arkham House published Long&#x27;s novel&quot; The Horror from the Hills&quot;, a work partly incorporating Lovecraft&#x27;s account of a dream Lovecraft had experienced. This work introduced Long&#x27;s alien entity Chaugnar Faugn into the Cthulhu Mythos cycle.

===1970s===
In 1972 Arkham House published&quot; The Rim of the Unknown&quot;, their second hardcover collection of Long&#x27;s work - a volume focusing primarily on his science fiction short stories.

Long wrote nine modern Gothic novels, starting with &quot;So Dark a Heritage&quot; in 1966 (published under his own name), eight of which were published as by &quot;Lyda Belknap Long&quot;, a combination of his wife (Lyda Arco Long)&#x27;s first name and his middle name and surname. Seven of these appeared during the 1970s; all were entirely his own work and were workmanlike products intended to support him and his wife rather than to be of high literary quality.

Illumination on Long&#x27;s own life and work is provided by his extensive introduction to &quot;The Early Long&quot; (1975), a collection of his best early stories which essentially duplicates the contents of &quot;The Hounds of Tindalos&quot; but to which Long adds detailed headnotes to each story. Further writing on his own life is found in his &quot;Autobiographical Memoir&quot; (Necronomicon Press, 1986).

Long&#x27;s book-length memoir of H. P. Lovecraft, &quot;Howard Phillips Lovecraft: Dreamer on the Nightside&quot;, was issued by Arkham House in 1975. It was written in haste as a result of Long&#x27;s reading of L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s&quot; &quot; (1975), which Long felt to be biased against Lovecraft. 

In 1977, Arkham House issued Long&#x27;s hardcover poetry collection &quot;In Mayan Splendor&quot;, containing all the poems from &quot;A Man from Genoa and Other Poems&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Goblin Tower&quot; (1926). The same year he won the First Fandom Hall of Fame award (1977). In 1978 he won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement (at the 1978 4th World Fantasy Convention).

===Later career: 1980s–1990s===

Long&#x27;s literary output slowed down after 1977, with his gothic &quot;The Lemoyne Heritage&quot;. He published several scattered stories in the 1980s including the story chapbook &quot;Rehearsal Night&quot; (Pub: Thomas L. Owen,1981) and one episode in the round-robin sequence &quot;Ghor Kin-Slayer&quot; (Necronomicon Press, 1997). He and his wife lived in extreme poverty during the 1980s and 1990s in an apartment in Chelsea, Manhattan - a period documented in Peter Cannon&#x27;s memoir &quot;Long Memories&quot; (1997).

In 1987, Long was awarded the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement (from the Horror Writers Association).

Long, though confined to a wheelchair, was a Guest of Honour at the H. P. Lovecraft Centennial Conference in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1990, where he spoke on panels regarding his memories of his great friend and literary mentor.

Long died of pneumonia on January 3, 1994, at the age of 92 at Saint Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Medical Center in Manhattan, after a seven-decade career as a writer and editor. He was briefly survived by his wife, Lyda.

Due to his poverty, he was interred in a potter&#x27;s field. Friends and colleagues had his remains reinterred at New York City&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery, in a family plot near that of Lovecraft&#x27;s grandparents. A graveside ceremony on November 3, 1995, was attended by such figures as Scott D. Briggs, Peter Cannon, Stefan Dziemianowicz, Ben P. Indick, S. T. Joshi, T.E.D. Klein and others and with a homily delivered by the Rev. Robert M. Price. On November 17, 1995, the actual interment of Long&#x27;s body took place, an event witnessed by Peter Cannon, Ben P. Indick and S. T. Joshi. Long&#x27;s fans contributed over $3,000 to have his name engraved upon the central shaft of his burial plot. Lyda died shortly after Frank; her ashes were scattered on his grave.

In 2015, Wildside Press acquired the rights to Long&#x27;s copyrights from Long&#x27;s cousins. Since that time, all Wildside Press reprints of Long&#x27;s work carry the acknowledgment &quot;Reprinted with the kind permission and assistance of Lily Doty, Mansfield M. Doty, and the family of Frank Belknap Long.&quot;

==Legacy==
Frank Belknap Long left behind a body of work that included twenty-nine novels, 150 short stories, eight collections of short stories, three poetry collections, and numerous freelance magazine articles and comic book scripts. Author Ray Bradbury summed up Long&#x27;s career: &quot;Frank Belknap Long has lived through a major part of science fiction history in the U.S., has known most of the writers personally, or has corresponded with them, and has, with his own writing, helped shape the field when most of us were still in our early teens.&quot;

==Friendship with Lovecraft==
H. P. Lovecraft was a close friend and mentor to Frank Belknap Long, with whom he came in contact in 1920 when Long was nineteen. Lovecraft found Long a stimulating correspondent especially in regard to his aesthetic tastes, focussing on the Italian Renaissance and French literature. Lovecraft published some of Long&#x27;s early work in his &quot;Conservative&quot; (e.g. &quot;Felis: A prose Poem&quot; [July 1923], about Long&#x27;s pet cat) and paid tribute to Long in a flattering article, &quot;The Work of Frank Belknap Long, Jun.,&quot; published anonymously in the &quot;United Amateur&quot; (May 1924) but clearly by Lovecraft. They first met when Lovecraft visited New York in April 1922. They saw each other with great frequency (especially during Lovecraft&#x27;s Brooklyn residence in New York City from 1924 to 1926), at which time they were the chief members of the Kalem Club and wrote to each other often. Long&#x27;s family apartment was always Lovecraft&#x27;s residence and headquarters during his periodic trips from Providence to New York. Long writes that he and Lovecraft exchanged &quot;more than a thousand letters, not a few running to more than eighty handwritten pages&quot; before Lovecraft&#x27;s death in 1937. Some of their correspondence has been reprinted in Arkham House&#x27;s &quot;Selected Letters&quot; series, collecting the voluminous correspondence of Lovecraft and his friends. Long&#x27;s &quot;Howard Phillips Lovecraft: Dreamer on the Night Side&quot; was extensively edited by James Turner.

During the 1920s, Long and Lovecraft were both members of the Kalem Club (named for the initials of the surnames of original members—K, L, or M). Long was also part of the loosely associated &quot;Lovecraft Circle&quot; of fantasy writers (along with Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Robert E. Howard, Henry Kuttner, Clark Ashton Smith, C. M. Eddy, Jr., and Donald Wandrei) who corresponded regularly with each other and influenced and critiqued each other&#x27;s works.

Long wrote a brief preface to the stillborn edition of Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Shunned House&quot; (1928). Lovecraft, in turn, ghostwrote for Long the preface to Mrs William B. Symmes&#x27; &quot;Old World Footprints&quot; (W. Paul Cook/The Recluse Press, 1928), a slim poetry collection by Long&#x27;s aunt. Long&#x27;s short novel &quot;The Horror from the Hills&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, Jan and Feb-March 1931; published in book from 1963) incorporates verbatim a letter by Lovecraft recounting his great &#x27;Roman dream&#x27; of Hallow&#x27;een 1927. Long teamed with Lovecraft in a revision service with Lovecraft in 1928. Long&#x27;s parents frequently took Lovecraft on various motor trips between 1929 and 1930, and Lovecraft visited Long at Christmas between 1932 and 1935 inclusive. Lovecraft helped set type for Long&#x27;s second poetry collection, &quot;The Goblin Tower&quot; (1935), correcting some of Long&#x27;s faulty metre in the process. Lovecraft&#x27;s letters to Long after 1931 have all been lost, with the letters up to that date existing primarily in transcriptions prepared by Arkham House.

The Long/Lovecraft friendship was fictionalized in Peter Cannon&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Pulptime: Being a Singular Adventure of Sherlock Holmes, Lovecraft, and the Kalem Club as if Narrated by Frank Belknap Long, Jr.&quot;. Long was a Guest of Honour at the Lovecraft Centennial Conference in Providence in 1990.

Long wrote a number of early Cthulhu Mythos stories. These included &quot;The Hounds of Tindalos&quot; (the first Mythos story written by anyone other than Lovecraft), &quot;The Horror from the Hills&quot; (which introduced the elephantine Great Old One Chaugnar Faugn to the Mythos), and &quot;The Space-Eaters&quot; (featuring a fictionalized HPL as its main character). A number of other works by Long can be considered as falling within the Cthulhu Mythos; these include &quot;The Brain Eaters&quot; and &quot;The Malignant Invader&quot;, as well as such poems as &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot; and &quot;When Chaugnar Wakes&quot;. A later Mythos story, &quot;Dark Awakening&quot;, appeared in &quot;New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;. The story betrays the influence of Long&#x27;s pseudonymous romantic fiction, and the final paragraph was added by the editor at Long&#x27;s suggestion.

The &quot;Hounds of Tindalos&quot; is Long&#x27;s most famous fictional creation. The Hounds were a pack of foul and incomprehensibly alien beasts &quot;emerging from strange angles in dim recesses of non-Euclidean space before the dawn of time&quot; (Long) to pursue travelers down the corridors of time. They could only enter our reality via angles, where they would mangle and exsanguinate their victims, leaving behind only a &quot;peculiar bluish pus or ichor&quot; (Long).

==Influence on popular culture==
The Hounds of Tindalos have been used or referenced by many later Mythos writers, including Ramsey Campbell, Lin Carter, Brian Lumley and Peter Cannon. Cannon&#x27;s story &quot;The Letters of Halpin Chalmers&quot;, a direct sequel to &quot;The Hounds of Tindalos&quot;, in which the main characters are thinly disguised versions of Frank and Lyda Long, appears in Robert Weinberg, Stefan R. Dziemianowicz and Martin H. Greenberg, &quot;100 Crooked Little Crime Stories&quot; (NY: Barnes and Noble, 1994). Creatures resembling the Hounds are antagonists in Shaun Hamill&#x27;s &quot;A Cosmology of Monsters&quot; (NY: Pantheon, 2019).

The Hounds have also inspired a number of metal and electronic music artists. Metallica (with their song &quot;All Nightmare Long&quot; from their ninth studio album &quot;Death Magnetic&quot;), Epoch of Unlight, Edith Byron&#x27;s Group, Beowulf, Fireaxe, and Univers Zero have all recorded tracks incorporating them.

Charles P. Mitchell has suggested that the &quot;drone dog&quot; in the film &quot;Phantoms&quot;, based on the novel by Dean R. Koontz, is reminiscent of a Hound of Tindalos.

Peter Cannon&#x27;s novel &quot;Pulptime&quot; features Long as the narrator. Long also appears in Richard Lupoff&#x27;s novel &quot;Lovecraft&#x27;s Book&quot; (1985) and its full-text version &quot;Marblehead&quot;.

The Wolves, perennial antagonists of the four-season horror comic series &quot;Witch Creek Road&quot; (2017–2021) and its spin-off &quot;Witch Creek High&quot; (2023; on hiatus) by Garth Matthams and Kenan Halilović, were based on the Hounds of Tindalos from Long&#x27;s short story of the same name.

<text>Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (Aquila fasciata) is a large bird of prey. The common name of the bird commemorates the Italian ornithologist and collector Franco Andrea Bonelli. Bonelli is credited with gathering the type specimen, most likely from an exploration of Sardinia. Some antiquated texts also refer to this species as the crestless hawk-eagle. Like all eagles, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle belongs to the family Accipitridae. Its feathered legs marked it as member of the Aquilinae or booted eagle subfamily. This species breeds from Southern Europe, Africa on the montane perimeter of the Sahara Desert, and across the Indian Subcontinent to Indonesia. In Eurasia, this species may be found as far west as Portugal and as far east as southeastern China and Thailand. It is usually a resident breeder. Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is often found in hilly or mountainous habitats, with rocky walls or crags, from sea level to . Habitats are often open to wooded land and can occur in arid to semi-moist climate. This eagle, though it can be considered partially opportunistic, is something of a specialist predator of certain birds and mammals, especially rabbits, galliforms and pigeons. On evidence, when staple prey populations decline or are locally scarce, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle switch to being an opportunistic predator of a wide variety of birds. Despite its persistence over a large range and its continued classification as a least concern species by the IUCN, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle has declined precipitously in various parts of its range, including almost all of its European distribution, and may face potential local extinction. The species&#x27; declines are due to widespread habitat destruction, electrocution from electricity pylons as well as persistent persecution.

==Taxonomy==
Bonelli&#x27;s eagle was described in 1822 by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The common name Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is for the collector of the type specimen, Franco Andrea Bonelli. Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is a member of the Aquilinae or booted eagles, a monophyletic subfamily of the accipitrid family. At least 38 species are currently housed in the subfamily, all with signature well-feathered tarsi. The African hawk-eagle (&quot;Aquila spilogaster&quot;) was once lumped with Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, with most accounts until about the 1990s listing the species as monotypical. However, several morphological differences between the two species, life history discrepancies and their considerably allopatric distribution lead them to being considered separate species. Despite the differences between Bonelli&#x27;s eagle and the African hawk-eagle the two species are visibly similar and are still considered sister species. However, genetic studies have indicated that they are not closely related relative to other species pairs of the booted eagle subfamily. Recent DNA research resulted in the two species being moved, in 2014, to the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; from &quot;Hieraaetus&quot;, along with another dissimilar species, the Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;Aquila africana&quot;). More specifically and surprisingly, Bonelli&#x27;s, African hawk- and Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagles were found to be genetically closely related to the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) species complex, which also includes Verreaux&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila verreauxii&quot;), Gurney&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila gurneyi&quot;) and wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax&quot;). These species are all conspicuously larger than Bonelli&#x27;s and African hawk-eagles with differing proportions to their wings, tail and legs (in adaptation to their open country habits) and much darker coloured plumages. Furthermore, the four other traditional members of the genus &quot;Aquila&quot; have been revealed to be a separate species complex despite showing superficial similarity to the golden eagle group, i.e. being relatively large and long winged with usually dark colouring. Beyond the nominate subspecies of Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, which is found throughout its range in Eurasia, a second subspecies dwells in the Lesser Sunda Islands, &quot;A. f. renschi&quot;. The latter race is linearly smaller, and compared to other Bonelli&#x27;s eagles tends to have more strikingly barred remiges and tail, the belly, thighs and crissum more boldly marked. At one time, its restricted and very isolated range have caused authors to suggest &quot;A. f. renschi&quot; may be a full species but recent studies have indicated that it is not genetically distinct enough to be considered a separate species. Furthermore, the most recent analysis couldn&#x27;t rule out early introductions (possibly by ancient falconers) at least playing a part in the species presence in the Lesser Sundas, as some other established wild birds on those islands are certain to have reached there by early human introductions.

==Description==
===Size and form===

Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is a fairly large bird of prey and a medium-sized eagle. When still classified as a member of the genus &quot;Hieraaetus&quot;, it was considered the largest extant species therein, however, as a member of &quot;Aquila&quot; it is amongst the smallest-bodied species. Amongst the currently accepted species of &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles, it is of similar size to the tawny eagle (&quot;Aquila rapax&quot;) (albeit with rather shorter wings than the tawny), slightly larger than the African hawk-eagle and notably larger than the Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagle. Like most birds of prey, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle displays reverse sexual dimorphism as the female is larger than the male to the contrary of most other kinds of birds, in this case she may average about 10% larger overall. Total length in fully-grown eagles of the species can vary from . Wingspan in males can vary from while that of the female may vary from . Prior claims put the weight of this species as , however this probably slightly underrepresents both their size and the sexual dimorphism of this eagle. A large sample of full grown males from western Europe were found to average , with a range of (sample size of 91), while 87 females were found to average , with a range of . Mature males from western Europe were found to have averaged in total length and in wingspan while mature females averaged in total length and in wingspan. Although the linear measurements reportedly increase slightly in average size in the eastern Asian part of the range, body weight was similar or slightly lower at a mean of and for males and females from the Indian subcontinent, respectively, though the sample size is unknown in this case. 

Bonelli&#x27;s eagles in general form appear to have a medium-sized head on a fairly long neck, a strong bill, a mid-to-longish tail and exceptionally long and well feathered legs. The combination of its well-proportioned, stout body and elongated legs may lend to descriptions of the species as &quot;athletic&quot; in appearance. This eagle often perches with a very upright carriage, at times openly on a rock, a crag, tree branches or some form of post but also in the foliage of tree cover, especially when actively hunting. When perched, the wing tips tend to fall a bit short of the tail tip. Among standard linear measurements, the wing chord of males varies from , with an average in western Europe of , in tail length from , with an average of , in tarsus length from , with an average of and in total bill length from , with an average of . Meanwhile, females vary in wing chord from , in tail length from , with an average of , in tarsus length from , with an average of , and in total bill length from , with an average of . Two males from the &quot;A. f. renschi&quot; race measured in wing chord length and a single female measured . Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is intermediate in its wing lengths and tail length proportionately between the shorter-tailed and longer-winged eagles of open country and longer-tailed and shorter-winged forest eagles, which allows to vary its hunting between short-burst, agile surprise attacks in trees and ample ground-covering pursuits in the open. Its talons and feet are proportionately very large and presumably rather powerful for the eagle&#x27;s size. In particular the elongated talon on its rear toe (used as a killing apparatus by almost all accipitrids), or hallux claw, is longer than that of the much larger eastern imperial eagle (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;) and proportionately slightly larger even than its bigger sympatric competitor, the golden eagle. Hallux claw lengths in Bonelli&#x27;s eagles from western Europe averaged in males and in females averaged , and could farther range up to .

===Colouring and identification===

Adult are dark brown above, from a cold hue similar to dark chocolate to an umber hue depending on their state of molt as well as to some extent individual and regional variances, with pale margins to most feathers. These pale margins are especially broad on the median wing coverts (which thus appear lighter brown overall). Adults also have a variably-sized, irregular white patch on the mantle that can vary from nearly absent (though almost never completely so) to being quite large and extending to the upper back. The adult&#x27;s tail is grey with obscure darker brown thin bars, with a broad blackish subterminal band and creamy white tip. The adult Bonelli&#x27;s head is dark brown with a paler, often streaky neck and a white throat. The underside has a cream base colour with variable amounts of sparse blackish-brown streaks or drop shaped markings. The adult female averages darker and more heavily patterned than the adult male, particular on the underside, a case of colour sexual dimorphism otherwise seemingly rare in booted eagles. The streaking on this eagle is normally strongest on the breast and upper flanks while the lower belly and crissum are typically either plain or only faintly marked. Juveniles are a lighter medium brown above with variable paler edges, sometimes with a creamy patch on the back (not the mantle as in the adults) and uppertail coverts. Generally, juveniles have a rusty-brown head with a darker brown around and behind their eyes. The juvenile eagle&#x27;s crown is either darkly streaked or, occasionally, plain greyish. The tail of young birds is more clearly barred than the adults while the subterminal band is only negligibly thicker than the other bars. Like adults, the juvenile Bonelli&#x27;s eagle&#x27;s tail has a thin white tip. The juvenile is light rufous to warm buff below with minimal black streaks, which are normally confined to chest-sides. By their 2nd summer, the young eagles are still largely the same in colouring but tend to become more patchy below with increased heavy streaking. During the gradual further development through subsequent molts, the immature eagles develop a thicker subterminal band and a paler ground colour below. Among the bare parts, adult&#x27;s eyes are yellow to yellow-orange while those of the juvenile are hazel-brown. Adult plumage is obtained between the 4th and 5th years. At all ages, the cere and feet are both pale yellow.

In flight, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is a largish raptor with a well projecting head and broad, long and somewhat square ended wings which are slightly pinched in at body with a little tapering at tips. Feather molts can make the wings look quite variable in shape with some individuals appearing rather longer and narrower winged than others. In flight, the tail appears long and broad but if pinched in can appear surprisingly narrow. This species tends to fly with powerful but loose shallow beats. When gliding, they do so often on flat wings with well-spread feathers and the carpals pressed slightly forward but more so when entering a fast glide. This species soars infrequently on flat or slightly raised wings. At nearly all times of the year, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles quite often flies in pairs. In colouring, the flying adult is dark above with a variable amount of the white marking on the mantle. The tail has faded barring (rarely perceptible) on grey with a big blotchy subterminal band and a white tip above. The markings on the tail look more or less the same when seen both from below and above. Adult Bonelli&#x27;s eagles have white lesser coverts which along with the greyish tail stand out in contrast against blackish central wing band over the greater and median coverts. Also the flight feathers are faintly and thinly barred light grey-brown with paler bases, which often become paler (to a whitish hue) on the primaries inside blackish tips and leading wing coverts. In flight, juveniles are brown above with slightly darker wing ends and tips to greater coverts and greyer primary windows. Occasionally, juveniles manifest a creamy patch on back and obscure narrow U above barred tail, which even if present are only sometimes visible. Below the juvenile&#x27;s wing linings are light rufous to warm buff like the body colour. Usually juveniles appear with darker tips to greater coverts forming wing-diagonals (sometimes lacking or confined to carpal area) and a small but distinct area of white on primaries against the blackish tips. Until the 3rd year, the young eagles appear more like a 1st year juvenile than an adult, but begin developing more streaks below and darker greater underwing coverts. By the 4th year, the subadult Bonelli&#x27;s are increasingly similar to the adult, with an increasing subterminal band, a whiter underbody and fairly prominent underwing-diagonals. However, subadults are often still appear with a mix of paler barred juvenile type feathers and plainer darker adult feathers on the flight feathers.

Bonelli&#x27;s eagles are generally unmistakable when shape, flight and plumage are considered in combination. In poor light, it is possible to mistake one with a honey buzzard, one mainly in Europe and another mainly in Asia, as these raptors are extremely polymorphic and can come surprisingly close to approximating the plumage of various more powerful raptors. The wing shape in Bonelli&#x27;s eagles can at times appear similar to that of honey buzzard but the latter raptor type are usually distinctly slimmer and slighter bodied with a much smaller, slimmer head. In flight, honey buzzards often have notched rather than square ended tails, less emarginated primaries and typically they fly with their wings held more at an angle. The sympatric species of honey buzzard tend to have bolder barring on the tail and underwings, broader dark trailing wing edges and all have no pale mantle patch or darker underwing-diagonals. An unlikely source of confusion is the northern goshawk (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), which is usually visibly smaller with much shorter wings, a slightly longer tail, different level flight style and many distinctive plumage characteristics. Distant juvenile Bonelli&#x27;s could conceivably be mistaken for the long-legged buzzard (&quot;Buteo rufinus&quot;), but the buzzard is also smaller and is shorter tailed with prominent dark carpal patches and dark trailing wing edges. Furthermore, the buzzard usually holds its wings in a noticeable dihedral when flying in a soar. Another unlikely confusion species is the short-toed eagle (&quot;Circaetus gallicus&quot;) which roughly matches the size of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles but the short-toed has larger and differently rather wedge-shaped wings with a much less dark overall pattern as well as a shorter tail, a rounder head on a shorter neck and usually a dark rather than light throat. Also, goshawks, short-toed eagles and European honey buzzards usually frequent different habitats, more often living in more wooded and lowland habitats. Bonelli&#x27;s eagles may be mistaken for pale morph adult booted eagle (&quot;Hieraeetus pennatus&quot;) by inexperienced observers but, beyond being a third larger and more than twice as heavy, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles are moreover distinct in plumage. Overall Bonelli&#x27;s are much darker and streaker especially compared to the clearly paler flight feathers of booted eagles. Booted eagles are both whiter and more contrasting on the upperwing coverts, have whitish uppertail-coverts and have white on the wing&#x27;s patagium. More similar in plumage is the juvenile Bonelli&#x27;s eagle are the rare rufous morph of the booted eagle but the latter can still be told by the booted species&#x27; narrower wings and smaller size. In southern part of the Red Sea, vagrants (largely juveniles) may possibly come into range of the closely related and more similar African hawk-eagle, but the latter is somewhat smaller and comparatively short winged and longer tailed (the total length is similar between the species due to the African&#x27;s longer tail but Bonelli&#x27;s can be visibly larger bodied and rather heavier). In the African species, the adult plumage is a more contrasting, with dark slate grey upperparts, purer white underparts with dark streaking. In African hawk-eagles, juveniles compared to Bonelli&#x27;s are darker above with pale wing-windows.

===Vocalizations===

Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is largely silent outside of breeding season and is a somewhat infrequent vocalizer even in the context of breeding. Its calls are less well studied than those of the African hawk-eagle, which although a tropical species, also generally ceases to call outside of the breeding season. The main call of Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is done during the courtship display and, sometimes, also at the nest. Its main call consists of a loud, shrill, somewhat far-carrying scream, &quot;yuiii-yuiii-gii-gii&quot; or a drawn-out &quot;heeeeii-heeeeii&quot; with slight regional or even individual variations. Its call is farther carrying than the &quot;puppy-like&quot; one of the golden eagle and is reminiscent in pitch of that of the red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;). The call may be given by both sexes. However, the female Bonelli&#x27;s eagle calls most intensely when the male is delivering prey unlike the preference for vocalizing in aerial display as the male usually does. Other recorded vocalizations have included a fluted, low-pitched &quot;klu-klu-klu&quot; as well as a repeated &quot;ki ki ki&quot; in alarm. Also other barking, gurgling and grunting sounds have been reported by researchers at or near the nests.

==Distribution and habitat==

Bonelli&#x27;s eagle have a spotty and sparse worldwide distribution currently. The species is distributed in northwestern Africa from the Anti-Atlas in Morocco northeasterly through the lower parts of the Atlas Mountains in northern Algeria and northern Tunisia (and probably formerly northern Libya). Beyond its African breeding range, the IUCN and others have mapped out a semi-regular wintering range for Bonelli&#x27;s eagles, in coastal west Africa from southern Morocco down through Western Sahara, Mauritania and northwestern Senegal (rarely also east to Mali), although little more is reportedly known about this population and its origins and altogether the species is considered largely non-migratory. Additionally, the species has been recorded as a vagrant in east Africa in Somalia as well. 

In southern Europe, they range patchily through different parts of Portugal and Spain into southern France as far north as the department of Drôme. Discontinuously, they are now seemingly solely left as breeding bird in Italy on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. They at least were known to live in Aspromonte National Park in Calabria, near the far southwestern tip of the Italian peninsula, directly across the narrow Strait of Messina from Sicily. In southeastern Europe, an isolated population possibly persists in Croatia as well as in northern and southern Macedonia (with the further possibility of spilling over into Kosovo) and spottily through different areas of Greece (possibly spilling over the borders in the west in Albania and in the east in Bulgaria), as well as Crete. 

Out of Europe, they may be found in western and southern Turkey, Syria (possibly but most likely extirpated), the isle of Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel, western Jordan, northeastern Egypt (rarely in northern half of Sinai Peninsula), possibly but not certainly in spots in the west and south of Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere in the Arabian Peninsula to Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. Elsewhere in the Middle East, their range includes eastern Iraq and west, south, and northeastern Iran, extending somewhat into Turkmenistan in the Kopet Dag range.

Further east into Asia, their distribution includes eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan through most of the Indian subcontinent, where generally it is uncommon but more locally common near Nepal. On the other hand, they are absent in eastern India and only occur as a vagrant to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. In India, they are most regularly found in areas such as the Chambal ravines, Ranthambore National Park, the Chir zone of the lower Kumaun Himalayas, and in winter in the Keoladeo National Park of Bharatpur, Rajasthan. From central Myanmar, they range across into northwestern Thailand and northern Laos (though possibly only as a visitor rather than breeding in the latter two). In southern China, their resident range includes Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong north to the Yangtze River, as well as rarely into Hong Kong. Their isolated Indonesian population range is in the Lesser Sunda Islands, including at least Sumbawa, Timor, Wetar, Luang, and Flores, however records show they&#x27;ve turned up on as many as 20 islands in the Lesser Sundas.

Historically speaking, research published in &quot;People and Nature&quot; in 2024 by scientists from the University of Granada and Miguel Hernández University of Elche (UMH) indicates that Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is a relative newcomer to Europe and the Mediterranean Basin and that they spread there with the help of humans around 50,000 years ago. Genetic analyses indicate that the Mediterranean Bonelli&#x27;s eagle population likely comprised a few individuals around the last glacial maximum, which later thrived as the temperature in the Mediterranean Basin rose, and the human population grew and became sedentary.

Mechanistically, the three bilateral interactions among Bonelli&#x27;s eagles, golden eagles, and the human population are jointly what allowed Bonelli&#x27;s eagles to move from the Middle East into the Mediterranean Basin at this time – and also what prevented them from moving there sooner. Golden eagles are less tolerant of humans than Bonelli&#x27;s eagles are. Additionally, between the two eagle species, the golden eagle is the dominant species, while Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is the subordinate one. With these interactions in mind, the authors of the 2024 &quot;People and Nature&quot; study hypothesize and test with data-driven mathematical models that with the arrival of the first anatomically modern humans in Europe, some of the golden eagle territories closest to human settlements were abandoned, and these &#x27;vacant&#x27; territories began to be occupied by Bonelli&#x27;s eagles from the Middle East. That is, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles could not have established themselves in the Mediterranean before the arrival of the first Homo sapiens because the competitive pressure exerted by golden eagles and other species would have been too overwhelming, but the arrival of humans displaced the golden eagles and provided an empty niche in the localities&#x27; ecosystems that Bonelli&#x27;s eagles were then able to neatly fill.

Bonelli&#x27;s eagles are mostly residential throughout their range but juvenile can disperse up to over several hundred kilometres. Sometimes, they are recorded at migration sites and at spots where not known to breed in winter. Wanderings include around north of their regular range in France near the coast of English Channel, far from their normal haunts in Regensburg, Germany and, probably both from the Italian island populations, to northwestern Italy and Slovenia. From their Iberian Peninsula range presumably, vagrants have been reported in the Canary Islands. Beyond Sri Lanka, other areas the species has been known to vagrate (or perhaps rarely winter) in Asia have included Kazakhstan, the Korean Peninsula, Malaysia and Cochinchina in Vietnam, as well as a record in winter 1996 on the isle of Yamdena, the latter presumably from the Lesser Sunda population.

===Habitat===
The Bonelli&#x27;s eagle tends to dwell in similar habitat types across its range and lives in lands hugging large bodies of water, largely the Mediterranean Sea and northern Indian Ocean. To a lesser extent, it lives near the coast of the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans and near the Caspian Sea. Despite often being near seas and oceans it mostly occurs in fairly arid habitats and in quite sunny areas. It prefers rocky areas including lower mountains and foothills with plentiful cliffs, as well as steep sided canyons and is very skilled at hunting in craggy, irregular rocky terrain. Usually, extensive garrigue-type habitat such as low bushes or more substantial vegetation such as scattered trees are a common feature of residential ranges but also at times even denser woodlands. Such scrubby areas are key since they hold prey concentration in Mediterranean habitats. However, excessive ground cover may limit hunting success so scrub is avoided when it becomes too dense. In the Mediterranean region, forests visited by Bonelli&#x27;s eagles are usually either pine forests or sclerophyll forests. Deep forests are generally avoided, however. Although Carrascal &amp; Seoane (2009) claimed that agricultural areas are generally avoided per their analysis in Spain, Martinez-Miranzo et al. (2016) indicated that the species was showing a growing preference for agricultural arable land and other human-modified habitats, probably as prey selection has shifted more heavily to pigeons out of necessity. A similar growing preference for arables was also detected in Sicily as well. However, urban areas are generally strongly avoided both as breeding and as foraging areas by this species. Bonelli&#x27;s eagles may additionally range into timbered plains or even virtually barren slopes or semi-desert, especially in areas such as Israel and India where moister valleys intersect with deserts. Juveniles may take up temporary residence over dry cultivation, small wetland areas, coastlines or surprisingly deep woodlands. In winter, these eagles may occur at times at lower elevation levels and more open habitats in semi-deserts and plains, where they can appear surprisingly at home, but often prefer wetter habitats such as large river mouths, marshlands and lakes, especially where these fall in existing home range, as prey is more likely to be concentrated in such areas. In some areas such as southeastern Asia, some of the Indian subcontinent and in the Lesser Sundas, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles may reside around tropical rainforest that is much wetter and more humid than their typical habitats, and in such areas are attracted to more sparse and rocky areas such as slopes and cliffs as well as alternately open mosaics and glades. Usually Bonelli&#x27;s eagles live at an elevation of or lower in Europe, to in their African Atlas mountain homes and to as high an elevation in Asia and even in residence in Bhutan. The main elevation where the species resides in the Himalayas falls between .

==Behaviour and dietary ecology==

This species is very aerial, often given to soaring and circling over its home range. Like most raptorial birds, it mainly lives solitarily or in a breeding pair. Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is a powerful predator, and has been described as rather &quot;bold and rapacious&quot;. Its primary hunting methods recall those of a powerful &quot;Accipiter&quot; such as a goshawk. Most commonly, this eagle still-hunts, often either utilizing a concealed tree perch or a lofty spot in irregular rocky terrain to watch for prey activity. Upon spotting its quarry, it often dashes out rapidly to take birds as they take off or a mammal as it runs for cover, at times making lengthy tail-chase that may continue between trees or into tree stands or bushes. Not infrequently as a latter part of a tail chase, these eagles (again reminiscent of a goshawk) will occasionally walk on the ground to obtain their prey. Bonelli&#x27;s eagles also hunt in a quartering flying style relatively close to the ground (in a fashion reminiscent of a harrier) or patrols hillsides for prey activity. Bonelli&#x27;s eagles will also occasionally stoop from a soaring height onto prey. Mostly, this predator takes birds from on or near the ground but some snatched them from bushes and, seldom, water. It has been known to have sufficient agility to catch some birds from active flight. In one case, a Bonelli&#x27;s eagle was observed to fly below a jackdaw and swoop upwards to grab it from below. Tandem hunting by a lifelong pair is quite common, almost exceptionally so in this species. One eagle tends to fly directly above the other, with several cases of one eagle scattering a bird flock for the other eagle to quickly single out, in a similar style to tandem-hunting laggar falcons (&quot;Falco jugger&quot;). However, per Spanish studies, apparently tandem hunting neither improved hunting success nor were the eagles able to capture larger prey (in fact the estimated prey size by pairs was slightly lower than that taken by each mate hunting by itself) while hunting in tandem. It was hypothesized that tandem hunting is more important to the socio-sexual relations of the pair rather than capture of a significant amount of prey. Compared to most other booted eagles, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle takes a great majority of its prey alive and seldom comes to carrion or pirates foods from other raptors. However, it will readily come to previously injured prey, especially water birds shot by duck hunters, and will readily take young animals across most prey classes. Also, in Keoladeo National Park, India, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles were observed to habitually follow harriers, spotted eagles and other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles in order to capture water birds incidentally flushed during their flybys.

Overall, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles take a fairly wide variety of prey. Across its wide range, their prey spectrum has been known to include perhaps up to nearly 200 prey species. Dietary studies have primarily been conducted in western Europe, though some study has gone into their food habits elsewhere (being well known in Cyprus and, less so, India). Brown &amp; Amadon (1986) considered Bonelli&#x27;s eagles prey size range as nearly as extensive as the most massive booted eagles, such as the golden eagle and the martial eagle (&quot;Polemaetus bellicosus&quot;) (but mainly may have been describing the African hawk-eagle that was lumped at the time). Bonelli&#x27;s eagles mainly hunts birds and mammals, taking reptiles and other prey types on a more local and sporadic basis. In western Europe, it is considered something of a specialist predator on rabbits and partridges, though other birds such as pigeons, gulls and corvids sometimes are taken as much or more so depending on local prey population trends. Pellet analysis is considered the most reliable way to get a complete picture of Bonelli&#x27;s eagle dietary habits. Despite its predaceous power, typically the average size of prey taken are within average range for a raptorial bird and it may take smaller prey on average than its mildly smaller cousin, the African hawk-eagle. In Sierra Morena, Spain, the mean size of prey taken was estimated at , while in Greece the mean prey size was estimated at . A subsequent study in Spain, however, posited the mean prey size as lower than in the past, stating that prey taken by males averaged an estimated and by females at , probably due to increased importance of pigeons and reduced numbers of rabbits. Thus, on average, prey sizes average about 20–45% of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles own weight. Furthermore, the latter Spanish study found hunting success of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles to average around 28.5%, a slightly higher hunting success rate than golden eagles (20%) or lesser spotted eagles (&quot;Clanga pomarina&quot;) (24%) but slightly lower than greater spotted eagles (&quot;Clanga clanga&quot;) (34%).

===Rabbits and other lagomorphs===

More than any other, the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) is considered the most important prey species for most European Bonelli&#x27;s eagles. In the largest European studies, the rabbit is usually the leading prey species: such as in Catalonia, Spain where rabbits comprised 22.54% of 2254 prey items (and 33.3% of the prey biomass) and in Provence, France where rabbits made up 16.4% of 2742 prey items. In the third largest western European study, rabbits were secondary in number to pigeons (at 18.4% of 1641 prey items) but were still the largest contributors of biomass, at 33.2%. Even where non-native, such as the Aegean islands of Greece, the European rabbit dominated the foods of this eagle, comprising 40.8% by number and 46.6% by biomass of the foods. In Spain, it was found that about three-quarters of studied floating juvenile Bonelli&#x27;s eagles were hunting rabbits almost exclusively, apparently as they were easier to capture despite their larger size than bird prey. Research determines that Bonelli&#x27;s eagle are often attracted to scrub areas during hunting forays to catch sight of rabbits foraying out of vegetative cover. Since young juvenile and yearling rabbits are forced out to more open feeding spots by dominant adult rabbits, they are disproportionately often selected by Bonelli&#x27;s eagles and other avian predators. Rabbits become more commonly caught during the summer when the young rabbits tend to disperse. On the contrary, 86.2% of the rabbits taken in southwest Portugal were reportedly adults. Most rabbits caught by Bonelli&#x27;s eagle were estimated to weigh between (from the size of a kit to a smallish adult) per Spanish studies, with an estimated average weight in Spain of . A study in southeastern Spain estimated that the region&#x27;s Bonelli&#x27;s eagles claim about 337 rabbits during the breeding season and 237 rabbits during non-breeding during the course of a year, so despite their heavy predation barely make a dent on the overall population of rabbits (effecting less than 2.5% of the population at peak). The native western European population of wild rabbit has been heavily depleted by myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease, having been reduced by an estimated 50–70%. While the overall numbers seemingly taken by them reduced by as much as a third between 1968 and 2009, on evidence Bonelli&#x27;s eagle still sought them out and hunted rabbits preferentially even during the non-breeding season when their numbers dip to their lowest. In additional, significant numbers of other lagomorphs may be taken, extending to occasional Granada hares (&quot;Lepus granatensis&quot;) as well as accounts of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles hunting European hares (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;) in the Greek isles and Indian hares (&quot;Lepus nigricollis&quot;) in the lower Himalayas.

===Gamebirds and pigeons===

The main secondary wild prey species associated with Bonelli&#x27;s eagles is the red-legged partridge (&quot;Alectoris rufa&quot;). Although at times capable of evading the attentions of eagles, this partridge occurs in conveys in the same mixed scrub that hold rabbits and is taken whenever the eagles are lucky enough to have the element of surprise. About 383 red-legged partridges were estimated to be hunted annually in one study area of southwestern Spain. In the large Spanish study of Catalonia, French study of Provence and in southwest Portugal, the red-legged partridge made up 9.57%, 11.6% and 17.2% of the diet by number, respectively. More so than any other prey type outside of western Europe, gamebirds such as partridges seem to be globally the most favoured prey type where available for Bonelli&#x27;s eagle. In Cyprus, a review of 528 prey items, revealed that the chukar (&quot;Alectoris chukar&quot;) was the main prey at 31.4% of the diet. More than a dozen gamebirds have been detected in the foods of this species from Asia with at least a half dozen genera turning up in a few reviews of their ecology in India. At times, even adult Indian peafowl (&quot;Pavo cristatus&quot;), potentially weighing up to , have been dispatched by this species. In the Lesser Sunda Islands, most eye-witness accounts of their hunting habits indicate that wild (or, on some islands, introduced) green junglefowl (&quot;Gallus varius&quot;) as well as village chickens (&quot;Gallus gallus&quot;) are likely to be the most important prey. Beyond gamebirds, pigeons are the other most significant avian prey type. The two larger European pigeons, the oft feral or domestic rock dove (&quot;Columba livia&quot;) and the common wood pigeon (&quot;Columba palumbus&quot;), are almost solely favoured among this group where encountered. In southwest Portugal, pigeons have surpassed rabbits (due to their disease-based decline) to become the most important prey. Here, attempts were made to parse the proportion of feral pigeons that were taken against the number of domestic pigeons (since pigeon fanciers frequently persecute this eagle due its allegedly heavily predation of domestic birds). Of the 1497 prey items overall, feral pigeons were found to comprise 30.1% of the food by number and 26% of the biomass while the domestic types made up only 9.7% of the diet by number and 7.2% of the biomass. In Catalonia, Spain, unidentified pigeons made up 17.8% of the foods and 17.4% of the biomass while identified common wood pigeons made up a further 6.24% of the number and 6.54% of the biomass, while a smaller study from the same area boosted wood pigeons to make up 11.3% of 524 prey items. In Cyprus, rock and common wood pigeons collectively made up 27.7% of the diet.

===Other birds===

Other medium-sized birds are taken widely by Bonelli&#x27;s eagles. A surprisingly popular dietary choice in western Europe was for yellow-legged gulls (&quot;Larus michahellis&quot;), weighing an estimated . In the 2724 prey items in Provence, France, this gull was second only to the rabbit in number, comprising 14.6% of the diet. Other gulls are readily taken by Bonelli&#x27;s eagles as well as wide diversity of other water birds, including rails, stone curlews, lapwings, sandpipers, tubenoses, cormorants and herons. Water birds taken Bonelli&#x27;s eagles may vary in size from wading birds as small as common sandpiper (&quot;Acitis hypoleucos&quot;) and diving birds as small as little grebes (&quot;Tachybaptus ruficollis&quot;) to those as large as adults of painted storks (&quot;Ciconia leucocephala&quot;), greylag goose (&quot;Anser anser&quot;) (though reportedly taken while injured by buckshot in India), and common crane (&quot;Grus grus&quot;). Corvids, of a dozen or more species and up to the size of the common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), are taken in considerable numbers in differing parts of the range. In Provence, France, Eurasian magpie (&quot;Pica pica&quot;) and western jackdaw (&quot;Corvus monedula&quot;) made up 10.17% and 9.95% of the diet respectively. In Portugal, Eurasian jay comprised 7.5% by number but only 2.7% of the biomass. Corvids were the leading prey for Bonelli&#x27;s eagles in Georgia, with the Eurasian magpie comprising 12.3% of the diet (though largely young were reportedly taken) and carrion crows (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;) making up a further 10.76%. In the Aegeans of Greece, carrion crows comprised 14.1% of the prey by number and 8.8% of the biomass, while south of Turkey in Cyprus, western jackdaw comprised 7.6% of the foods. Other assorted avian prey groups taken in usually smaller numbers include cuckoos, swifts, bustards, nightjars, bee-eaters, rollers, hoopoes. woodpeckers and parrots. Among passerines, which are usually quite secondary besides corvids, they&#x27;ve been known to hunt various larks (up to nearly 11% of the diet in Georgia), shrikes, swallows, accentors, Old World flycatchers (at least 10 different species), thrushes, pipits, starlings, buntings, finches and Old world sparrows. In total, some 130 bird species may be taken and birds as a whole almost always form the most ample part of the diet compared to other classes: 69.5% and 80.97% of the biomass in the south of France, 67.7% in Georgia and 62.6% in Catalonia, Spain.

===Other assorted prey===
Beyond the high significance of rabbits (and sometimes other lagomorphs), other mammals are rarely as important or diverse in the diet of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles as birds are. A couple of rodents can be locally significant secondary prey, however. The red squirrel (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;), with a mean estimated mass in Spain of , was reported in almost all western Europe studies, with about 130 reported as taken in studies from Provence, France. The black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;), of similar size to the squirrel at an average of about was an important secondary food source in islands south and east of Greece, being the second most common prey species in Cyprus (15.5% of 528 prey items) and fifth most important prey species in the Aegean islands. In northwestern Africa such as Morocco, it was reported that the fat sand rat (&quot;Psammomys obesus&quot;), another rodent of similar size, was amongst the favourite foods locally for Bonelli&#x27;s eagles. Other rodent species known in the diet of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles have included other squirrels, gundis, assorted mice, voles, dormice and blind mole rats. Beyond a few species of hedgehogs, additional mammalian prey for this species, although seldom taken, can be relatively large. They&#x27;ve been known to attack the young of various ungulates include blackbuck (&quot;Antilope cervicapra&quot;), chinkara (&quot;Gazella bennettii&quot;), domestic goats (&quot;Capra aegagrus hircus&quot;) and domestic sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;). In the Aegean islands, live-caught but often young and small goat kids comprised 8.5% of the foods and 24.3% of the biomass at nests. Among carnivorans, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles have reportedly attacked red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) and wildcats (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;) (probably mostly kits and kittens of these two species) in western Europe as well as stone martens (&quot;Martes foina&quot;) and assorted weasels. Meanwhile, adult Bengal fox (&quot;Vulpes bengalensis&quot;) have reportedly been caught in India. In France and Spain, mammals overall comprised 34.8% and 26.1% of the diet, respectively, whereas in Georgia they made up 15.4% of the diet. Reptiles are usually secondary prey throughout the range. Though they are known to hunt snakes, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles rarely hunt them and generally seem to pursue lizards by preference. In Cyprus, starred agamas (&quot;Laudakia stellio&quot;) comprised 5.9% of the food, unidentified &quot;Lacerta&quot; lizards 10.76% of diet in Georgia (and reptiles altogether adding up to 16.9% of the food by number). Relatively large adult specimens of ocellated lizard (&quot;Timon lepidus&quot;), at in mean body mass, made up 3.97% of the biomass and 7.05% by number in Catalonia, Spain. Desert monitor (&quot;Varanus griseus&quot;) and probably assorted other monitor lizards were reportedly amongst the leading prey for Bonelli&#x27;s eagles in several parts of India. Minor prey includes toads and possibly a few other types of amphibian. Potentially insects and/or other invertebrates may be taken but these may incidentally consumed (i.e. undigested food from the stomachs of prey).

===Interspecies predatory relationships===

Bonelli&#x27;s eagles frequently occur in range with multiple other eagles and competing predators. Almost certainly the most direct competitor from their European range to the Middle East is their much larger cousin, the golden eagle. Habitat preferences overlap between these two eagles with both species favouring rocky habitats, though the golden eagle regularly dwells at slightly higher elevations with alpine meadows (though is as adaptive to low elevations as Bonelli&#x27;s so long as habitat is favourable and undisturbed). Competition between the eagles has been reported in particular from Spain, in areas such as Sierra Morena. Both species excluded each other from mutual territories and had broadly overlapping food habits. However, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle took more birds and golden eagle more singularly hunted rabbits. Mean distance between nests on a plot of was found to be for 8 pairs of golden eagles and for 10 pairs of Bonelli&#x27;s. The two can co-exist with sufficiently large ranges as long as they are able to maintain their own range, with the existence of trophic segregation (by size and the more avian based diet of Bonelli&#x27;s) and the lag in the breeding periods, as these natural mechanisms would allow the coexistence of both species in the mountain. Cases of golden eagles taking over prior Bonelli&#x27;s eagles territories have been reported but usually golden eagles only takes up the prior Bonelli&#x27;s territory when the latter vanishes due to unrelated (often anthropogenic) causes not direct competition or usurpation. A minor negative effect has been probably correlated with golden eagles not infrequently attacking and displacing juvenile and subadult Bonelli&#x27;s eagles and can tend to be behaviourally dominant in keeping with its larger size. This in turn presumably hampers the ability of Bonelli&#x27;s to expand their range after declines and stabilize their population. Further east, in Israel, Bonelli&#x27;s and golden eagles are competitors as well. In the dry, barren Negev desert, golden eagles nests were found apart and Bonelli&#x27;s were scarce. In the Judean desert, which has more annual rainfall and more available prey, the distance between golden eagle nests averaged and Bonelli&#x27;s eagle easily outnumbered them. Apparently, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle exceptionally outcompeted its larger cousin here due to a subtle topographic variation in the habitat. In Spain, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles share cliff habitats beyond golden eagles also with peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), common ravens, Eurasian eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) and three species of vulture. The eagles tend to dominate the smaller carnivorous birds in most circumstances, even the swifter peregrine. However, the still larger griffon vulture (&quot;Gyps fulvus&quot;) was apparently a routine territory and nest usurper of other birds of prey, displacing golden eagles, bearded vultures (&quot;Gypaetus barbatus&quot;) and Egyptian vultures (&quot;Neophron percnopterus&quot;) from their nests as well as 9 out of 23 eyries built by Bonelli&#x27;s eagles in the study area. Despite their prior claimed &quot;dominance&quot; over the swift falcons, at least three cases have been observed of peregrine falcons usurping Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (presumably through routine harassment and dive-bombing) nests in Spain. Beyond golden eagles, peregrines and griffon vultures, tawny owls (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;) have been known to take over old Bonelli&#x27;s eagle nests.

European rabbits have a huge range of predators in the Iberian peninsula, with at least 30 different species known to hunt the once densely-populated lagomorph. Besides the overlapping ranges of Bonelli&#x27;s and golden eagles, most other birds of prey that hunt rabbits extensively are partitioned from the potential depletive effect of competition by differences in habitat preferences, hunting techniques and temporal activity. Beyond the specialized mammalian predator, the Iberian lynx (&quot;Lynx pardinus&quot;), some of the other most specialized predators of wild rabbits are Bonelli&#x27;s eagles, golden eagles, Spanish imperial eagles (&quot;Aquila adalberti&quot;) and Eurasian eagle-owls. A comparative study indicated that the golden eagle diet was comprised 40% by rabbits, while they made up 49% for eagle-owls, 50% for Spanish imperial eagles and 61% for Bonelli&#x27;s eagle. Elsewhere, higher import has been applied for rabbits in the local diet of golden eagles as well as for Spanish imperial eagles. The mean size of rabbits taken increases more or less with the size of the avian predator: for Eurasian goshawks, for Bonelli&#x27;s eagles, for Eurasian eagle-owls and for golden eagles.

Along with northern goshawks, golden eagles and Eurasian eagle-owls, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is considered a &quot;super predator&quot; in the European region due to its habit of hunting other predators. In contrast to the other birds of prey, they are somewhat less commonly at high predator status compared to goshawks (most common predator of other diurnal raptors in studies), golden eagles (most common predator of mesopredator mammals), and eagle-owl (most common predator of other owls). However, they are relatively common predators of other diurnal birds of prey, per overall analysis they took such prey somewhat more regularly than did golden eagles in Europe. Among the other accipitrids that Bonelli&#x27;s eagle have been known to hunt include the Indian spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga hastata&quot;), European honey buzzard (&quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;), red kite (&quot;Milvus milvus&quot;), black kite (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;), western marsh harrier (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot;), Montagu&#x27;s harrier (&quot;Circus pygargus&quot;), hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaenus&quot;), Eurasian sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;), shikra (&quot;Accipiter badius&quot;), Eurasian goshawk, long-legged buzzard and common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;). Among falcons, they&#x27;ve been known to prey upon common kestrel (&quot;Falco tinnunculus&quot;), lesser kestrel (&quot;Falco naumanni&quot;) and peregrine falcon and as for owls, tawny owl (&quot;Strix alucco&quot;), little owl (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;), long-eared owl (&quot;Asio otus&quot;), short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;) and most impressively of all, in at least one instance, an adult Eurasian eagle-owl. Although usually classed as an apex predator, as in most cases of apex predators in competitive environments, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles sometimes infrequently fall victim to interspecific killings and predation as well. Eurasian eagle-owls have been known to prey on Bonelli&#x27;s nestlings a few times and possibly also an adult at least once. In one case, a subadult male golden eagle preyed upon an adult male Bonelli&#x27;s eagle. Stone martens are also counted amongst the predators of nests (exclusively as egg thieves) in Spain.

==Breeding==
===Pair formation and nest distribution===
Bonelli&#x27;s eagles, like most but not all raptorial birds, generally lives solitarily or in pairs. They usually mate for life. Territories are maintained through aerial displays which often involve calling, single or mutual high circling and, most frequently, sky-dancing in the area of eyrie. During this species&#x27; sky-dances, one or other of the eagle pair plunges headlong from a great height, with its wings almost closed, before checking and rising again on stiff wings, circling to regain original altitude and diving again. The sky-dance sequence may be repeated up to 5–10 times. Occasionally but usually infrequently, territorial exclusions escalate into talon grappling between a territorial bird and an intruder. Aerial display extend with diminished frequency into the incubation and early nestling periods. In Spain, the average estimated size of a pairs home range was a very large , though only 27.3% of their home ranges on average were used in all seasons. Home ranges in Portugal were estimated to average up to . On Cyprus, the mean nearest neighbor distance was with 0.52–0.65 pairs per . Contrary to many other raptor species, it was found that were no significant relationship between the density of their main prey species and the distance of the neighbouring pairs. A dead or missing mate may be quickly replaced and mature adults have additionally been seen breeding with subadults.

The breeding season of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles is from late January/February to July in the western part of the range and November–August/September (peaking December–May) in the Indian subcontinent and Myanmar. Both members of the pair may dwell around the eyrie for up to 2–3 months before breeding. Their nest is a huge structure of branches and sticks, scarcely smaller than those built by eagles twice the size of this species, though rarely as great in depth as some old nests of the larger eagles. Often the nest completely obscures the sitting female from view unless it is seen at the same level or higher than the nest. Nest size can average up to across and deep but with repeated use the nest can range up to in both directions (record sized nest in India was in height). Tree nests tend to average larger than those placed on cliff ledges. One nest in the Gir forest was used periodically used over the course of 30 years. While they may line their active nest with greenery, it is less frequent and sparser where present than in many other birds of prey. Nesting locales are often high on cliff ledge or alternatively at (usually over ) above the ground in large trees. Very rarely, nests may too be on the perimeter of buildings. The trees selected are often the tallest and/or most densely foliaged in a given stand. Their close cousin, the African hawk-eagle, usually nests on trees and rarely utilizes crags and alternate nesting sites as does Bonelli&#x27;s. Historically, throughout their range in western Europe, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles were considered almost obligate cliff nesters on almost any rocky environment, from precipitous mountain ranges, canyons over river valleys, even down to low rocky rubble to sea cliffs. However, up to 52 tree nests for the species have now been recorded in southwest Portugal. Often the Portuguese nesting eagles used invasive Tasmanian blue gum (&quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot;) (44.2% of the time) while a further 21.2% were on cork oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;) not to mention some that were placed on large shrubs, i.e. strawberry trees (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;). The mean height of Portuguese tree nest was . The Portuguese study further found 67.3% of the tree nests to be on hill slopes and average height for lowest branch, both presumably as anti-predator measure. By 2017, the expansion to using tree nests had bolstered the southwest Portugal population considerably. In the 1990s, the first ever tree nest was found in the relative Bonelli&#x27;s eagle stronghold of Catalonia, Spain, while another singular tree nest was also found in the south of France. In India, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles seem to readily switch between tree and cliff nests. The eagles of areas such as Maharashtra and the Western Ghats are usually partial to nesting in trees while in the Deccan Peninsula, Indo-Gangetic plain and Himalayan foothills, the eagles alternated between nesting on cliffs and lofty trees including red silk cotton (&quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;), sacred fig (&quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;), Javan plum (&quot;Syzygium cumini&quot;) or &quot;Dalbergia ssp&quot;. Bonelli&#x27;s eagles in India may also nest close to human habitations if disturbance is low, such as in Saurashtra and in Himalayan foothills, in the latter often in large chir pine (&quot;Pinus roxburghii&quot;) near villages. In Pakistan, the species has been known to use seaside cliffs. Also, in the Indian desert zone, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles are known to use relatively low rocky hills with shallow gradients, making the nest ledges relatively easy to access. On Cyprus, 70% of nests were in Turkish pines (&quot;Pinus brutia&quot;) at a mean elevation of . Often this eagle uses the same nest in successive years but also alternate nest may be used. Often somewhere between 1 and 5 nests may be built by the species on their home range. Like other birds of prey, the presence of alternate nest may be a strategy to cope with ectoparasitic infestations within the nest. The construction of a new nest takes roughly a month&#x27;s time.

===Development of young===
The clutch size is usually 2, though one egg is not infrequently laid. This species seldom lays three eggs, though there are now a few records of this and even three large eaglets recorded in a nest. Their eggs are largely white but are often sparingly spotted and streaked with brown. In a sample of 120, egg height was measured as , with an average of by in diameter, with an average of . Egg laying dates peak from February to April in France, January in North Africa while in India, the peak may be December to April, sometimes even into May (as in the Himalayas). Incubation lasts for 37 to 41 days in Europe but is estimated at a more prolonged 40–45 days in the more tropical Indian subcontinent. Incubation is mainly done by the female (about 90% of the time) while males mainly capture food. Upon hatching, the eaglets are altricial initially. The first feathers start appearing through the white down at 25–35 days and practically cover the body by 45 days. By the latter stage, the eaglets can normally feed themselves but may be variable in learning ability. Fledgling period is at 56 to 65 days of age (rarely as late as 70 days). The average age at fledging in Spain was estimated at 63 days. Female broods about 90% of the time for first two weeks after first hatching but this decreases to 50% by the end of those weeks. The female attacks potential predators that come near the nest including other raptors. In the Indian subcontinent, they&#x27;ve been seen to escort oriental honey buzzards, crested serpent eagles (&quot;Spilornis cheela&quot;), bearded vultures, as well as &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures, conspecifics and corvids away from the eyrie vicinity while the presence of northern plains grey langurs (&quot;Semnopithecus entellus&quot;) was observed to provoke a fierce defensive attack. However, unlike African hawk-eagles, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles rarely attack humans at the nest. Males at times have been observed to take a share of the brooding and rarely even feeding the eaglet(s). Caches of food are often stored early on but are quickly depleted and rarely still present latter in the nesting period when the eaglets growth accelerates. The female lingers near nest even after brooding stage. However, the female also tends to take part in prey capture relatively early in fledging period compared to many other eagles. In the latter third of the post-fledging period, the parents are rarely in attendance except when bringing food. The dependence of the young eagles may extend for about 8 to 11 weeks, but has individually varied from 50 to over 120 days. Research on conditions and habitat composition has indicated variation in the post-fledgling dependence stage is derived from habitat quality or from parental skill. However, fledgling body condition seemed to play no major role in this stage. On evidence, the young eagles drift from their parents care independently.
===Post-breeding===
One of the most significant portions of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles lifecycle is the dispersal stage. The dispersal and post-dispersal stage has been studied at length in western Europe, with a surprising amount of individual variation being found. Here, dispersal occurred at an average age of 142 days (occasionally up to 163 days old) with a varying distance of dispersal from nest to settlement area were from . The average distance of dispersal in France was . Anywhere from 58% of 47 to 87% of 7 juveniles survived per these radio-tagged studies. The high distance dispersal of the juvenile Bonelli&#x27;s eagles may potentially benefit gene flow. At least 20 communal roosts for post-dispersal juvenile Bonelli&#x27;s eagles were found in Spain. Each were found to house between 2 and 11 eagles of the species, with mean of 5.1. It was also found the juveniles were usually sharing many of the roosts with Spanish imperial eagle juveniles as well (in 91.4% of roost) though each species clustered separately in different parts of the trees or bushes. More infrequently, assorted other species of raptor would join the juvenile eagle roosts at dusk.

===Breeding success and causes of failures===

The breeding success of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles may vary considerably. Mean fledgling success on Cyprus was found to be 1.44 per pair. In Sicily, breeding success was found to vary 0.67 (in the 1990s) to 1.37 (in the 2000s after some protection) and productivity of successful pairs was from 1.42 (2000s) to 1.51 (1990s). Of 1506 breeding attempts in western Europe, 65.7% were successful. Of these successful ones, 39.8% produced one fledgling, 59.7% produced two and only 0.5% produced three fledglings. Like many birds of prey, siblicide or cainism has occurred, wherein the eldest nestling repeatedly attacks, often killing and occasionally eating their younger siblings. In about 20% of nest, the second chick survives, therefore this species is classed as a facultative cainist rather than an obligate one. On evidence, egg laying and hatching may grow more asynchronous when frequently interrelated outside stressors such as food supply, habitat disturbance and poor weather are applied, all of which may increase the likelihood of cainism. Whether the young have died by siblicide or via other means, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles have been known to consume their own dead nestlings on a couple of occasions. On evidence, the younger eaglets of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles and other species in areas where threatened may too survive by human intervention, wherein they remove the chicks and either raise them in semi-captivity or introduce them to a new set of parents. In India, habitat and the resulting prey composition were found to be the most significant drivers of breeding success. In protected areas such as Ranthambore National Park, nest often produce two fledglings, while in degraded areas such as the Kumaun division, they often produce just one. Fledgling number here was thought to be driven primarily by prey carrying capacity of a given area. When an almost fledged young was stolen by village children in India, 15 hours later, researchers introduced another which was accepted by parents. In a similar case, another Indian pair rejected its own nearly fledged eaglet after it had been stolen, however with repeated attempts was accepted and successfully fledged. When poachers stole some eagles in Spain, a couple of pairs were found to successfully lay replacement clutches (each with the typical 2 eggs) some 25–30 days later. A western European review of 1052 breeding attempts indicated a negative correlation with colder temperatures and heavier rains during nesting. Therefore, in more temperate areas such as northern Spain, the average breeding success was lower and the young often dispersed southwards due to the cooler climate.

==Conservation and rehabilitation==

Bonelli&#x27;s eagles have sharply declined, at least locally inexorably and drastically, in much of their range. In the 1990s, it was estimated that the entire west Palearctic held about 2000–3000 pairs with the Iberian peninsula (750–845 pairs) and northwestern Africa (1000 or so) being the core areas. In the mid-1990s, it was indicated that there were 938–1039 pairs in all of Europe, about 75–80% of which in Spain with an estimated 75–90 in Portugal, 35–45 in Greece, 29 in France, 15–20 in Italy, and a handful each in Croatia and Albania. By the 2000s, with some continued declines and minor local recoveries (as well as more comprehensive surveying) resulted in an estimate of 1500 pairs in Europe, still far less than historic numbers (at least a 30% reduction since the 1950s) and qualifying the species for local critically endangered status. Local extinction is probable in many if not all populations yet there is no overarching action plan for conserving the species. On evidence, populations in core protected areas have increased but fringe areas, important especially to vagrant juveniles, continue to show strong declines and high mortality rates. Although listed today on the IUCN Red List as breeding species there, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle may be extinct as a nesting species in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2010, 20 to 22 breeding territories have been found in Sicily and it was thought that this population holds about 95% of the remaining Italian population. Sicilian eagles per study were shown to have high adult mortality (10.2%) and at least 17 pairs in 2010 failed to breed altogether. In their Spanish stronghold, the species has declined or disappeared in 27 out of 40 provinces since 1980, with over 20% reduction in north and central parts. The coastal sierras of east and south Iberia hold highest European densities at 1 pair per , but once formerly it held a pair per in the 1970s. In the Region of Murcia, Spain, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle was considered the second most threatened raptor species, behind only the lesser kestrel. In the Province of Burgos in northern Spain the number of pairs reduced from 25–27 to 10 between 1980 and 1996. Of 100 breeding attempts from 1988 to 1996, only 0.3 were successful and average success rate was only 0.35, despite surplus feeding beginning after 1992. From 200 or more pairs in Greece in the early 1980s, the population has fallen to less than 50. What was roughly estimated to be about 50 pairs (estimated earlier at up to 100), in Turkey in the late 1980s to the 1990s, has recently been revised based on research to only 20–35 pairs in isolated small pockets. In Israel, 28 pairs of Bonelli&#x27;s eagle were known to be present in 1989 but little information has been obtained from the rest of Middle East and from Asia. Israeli populations are estimated to have been halved in size. By 2001, only 15 pairs were known to breed in Israel. Besides the four species that have become locally extinct in Israel, it is likely that Bonelli&#x27;s eagle is the most endangered Israeli raptor. It was estimated that the maximum number in Asia is likely around 35,000 pairs but it could be well less than half of that. Perhaps the only factor preventing authorities such as the IUCN from uplisting Bonelli&#x27;s eagle to a more severe status is due to lack of extensive research on their population in the Asian range. Strong declines in Asia may be occurring as well. A bird survey of a large area of Uttarakhand, India where the species was historically present failed to find any signs of remaining Bonelli&#x27;s eagles. In Gujarat, India, an analysis from the 1990s determined that the species was increasingly scarce due to human disturbance and logging.

In multiple parts of the range, certainly in western Europe as well as Cyprus, Bonelli&#x27;s eagles face a high degree of persecution by hunters, gamekeepers and pigeon-fanciers. Shooting and poisoning of this species persist extensively into the 21st century. Habitat alteration and destruction (e.g. development of roads, intensified agriculture, irrigation of dry fields) in addition to reduced prey numbers and human disturbance in the nesting area are ongoing and increasing threats everywhere for this eagle. Even human activity such as large quantities of people on holiday has been shown to have a negative effect on this eagle as they may alter their range to avoid such activity. From 1990 to 1996, 424 dead Bonelli&#x27;s eagles in Spain were recorded, 55% died due to electrocution and 26% due to poisoning and shooting. Adults were mainly killed via persecution whereas most juveniles died by electrocution. In Catalonia and central Spain, 50% and 86% due to electrocution whereas persecution was more major in Levante and Green Spain (accounting for 52% and 43% of deaths). Abandonment of territories could not be correlated to interspecific competition but was linked to human influence and persecution. In Sicily, the main threats are thought to be habitat fragmentation and intensifying agriculture. Previously egg-collectors were semi-regularly exacerbating the reduction of the species on Sicily, but this behaviour has seemingly declined mercifully in recent years. Given its relative scarcity in Crete, only a small number of Bonelli&#x27;s eagles were recovered dead from persecution when compared to other raptors. However, death through shooting and poisoning is surely not sustainable given the low population there. Increasing overhead power line collisions resulting in electrocution from highly dangerous pylons are a major cause of mortality, resulting in unsustainably high population turnover. In one Spanish study area, 56% of juveniles and 13% of adults were killed by electrocution. In France, 44% of radio-tagged post-dispersal juveniles were killed by electrocution. Wind farms in Spain are a potential growing source of changed territories and deaths for Bonelli&#x27;s eagles but they are likely to be less effected locally than golden eagles. Lead poisoning from bullets in injured small game, which have been associated with high lead levels in eagle feathers in several parts of their range. Research from western Europe and northeastern Africa has indicated low genetic diversity in these populations, which cause concerns of a population bottleneck for the species in these former strongholds.

===Conservation efforts===
Research has indicated that the most significant predicted cause to a strong recovery for Bonelli&#x27;s eagles in Europe would be conservation of appropriate habitats, followed by higher survival rates for territorial and non-territorial eagles. It was suggested in 2008 that reducing risk of electric powerline collisions and reducing persecution are the most immediate and significant measures that should be taken to retain Bonelli&#x27;s eagles in Spain. Research indicated that 99% of avian mortality would be reduced by modifying only 27% of the pylons in areas inhabited by the eagles. As reported by 2015, biologists in coordination with local authorities started to properly insulate dangerous powerlines in green areas in order to help converse this and other threatened birds. It was shown that the local population growth rates increased quickly as a result (from 0.82 to 0.98). However, this study showed an apparent increase of anthropogenic mortality from other causes, such as car collisions, in sync with reduced electrocution. It was estimated that for stage of 2008–2014, 0.28 and 0.64 of mortality was still due to electrocution for territorial and non-territorial eagles. In further efforts to converse the species locally, Spanish researchers have provided supplemental feedings to these eagles, which may improve their odds of successfully producing young.

<doc id="754680" wikidata="Q1126676" url="?curid=754680" title="Tehachapi Loop">
<text>The Tehachapi Loop is a spiral, or helix, on the Union Pacific Railroad Mojave Subdivision through Tehachapi Pass, of the Tehachapi Mountains in Kern County, south-central California. The line connects Bakersfield and the San Joaquin Valley to Mojave in the Mojave Desert.

Rising at a steady two-percent grade, the track gains in elevation and makes a circle. Any train that is more than long—about 56 boxcars—passes over itself going around the loop. At the bottom of the loop, the track passes through Tunnel 9, the ninth tunnel built as the railroad was extended from Bakersfield.

The line averages about 36 freight trains each day. Passenger trains such as Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;San Joaquins&quot; are banned from the loop, although the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; can use it as a detour. Its frequent trains and scenic setting make the Tehachapi Loop popular with railfans. In 1998, it was named a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. It is also designated as California Historical Landmark #508.

==History==
One of the engineering feats of its day, the Loop was built by Southern Pacific Railroad to ease the grade over Tehachapi Pass. Construction began in 1874, and the line opened in 1876. Contributors to the project&#x27;s construction include Arthur De Wint Foote and the project&#x27;s chief engineer, William Hood.

The siding on the loop is known as Walong after Southern Pacific District Roadmaster W. A. Long.

The project was constructed under the leadership of Southern Pacific&#x27;s civil engineers, James R. Strobridge and William Hood, using a predominantly Chinese labor force. The Tehachapi line necessitated 18 tunnels, 10 bridges, and numerous water towers to replenish steam locomotives. Between 1875 and 1876, about 3,000 Chinese workers equipped with little more than hand tools, picks, shovels, horse-drawn carts and blasting powder cut through solid and decomposed granite to create the helix-shaped loop with grades averaging about 2.2 percent and an elevation gain of . In 1882, the line was extended through Southern California and the Mojave Desert with 8,000 Chinese men working under Strobridge and another man.

==Operations==

The Loop became the property of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1996, when the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems merged. Trains of the BNSF Railway also use the loop under trackage rights.

Although Southern Pacific ran passenger trains on the Loop for years, it banned passenger service there soon after handing its trains to Amtrak in 1971. Union Pacific has maintained the ban since taking over Southern Pacific. As a result, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;San Joaquin&quot; train is unable to directly serve Los Angeles until a bypass is constructed or the United States federal government or the California State Legislature compel the railroad to allow passenger service to resume. Amtrak operates Amtrak Thruway buses for passengers wanting to travel between the Central Valley and Los Angeles. An exception is made for the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, which uses the line as a detour if its normal route is closed.

==Recognition and access==

A concrete viewing platform was constructed at the scenic overlook on Woodford-Tehachapi Road in the summer of 2021, allowing railroad enthusiasts to watch trains on the loop at a safe distance from the winding, two-lane roadway.

The Tehachapi Depot Museum is located in the nearby town of Tehachapi.

The California Historical Landmark plaque reads:

:&quot;NO. 508 TEHACHAPI LOOP - From this spot may be seen a portion of the world-renowned Loop completed in 1876 under the direction of William Hood, Southern Pacific railroad engineer. In gaining elevation around the central hill of the Loop, a 4,000-foot train will cross 77 feet above its rear cars in the tunnel below.&quot;

A large white cross, &quot;The Cross at the Loop&quot;, stands atop the hill in the center of the loop in memory of two Southern Pacific Railroad employees killed on May 12, 1989, in a train derailment in San Bernardino, California.

<doc id="754681" wikidata="Q2500127" url="?curid=754681" title="John R. Swanton">
<text>John Reed Swanton (February 19, 1873 – May 2, 1958) was an American anthropologist, folklorist, and linguist who worked with Native American peoples throughout the United States. Swanton achieved recognition in the fields of ethnology and ethnohistory. He is particularly noted for his work with indigenous peoples of the Southeast and Pacific Northwest.

==Early life and education==
Born in Gardiner, Maine, after the death of his father, Walter Scott Swanton, he was raised by his mother, née Mary Olivia Worcester, his grandmother, and his great aunt. From his mother, in particular, he was imbued with a gentle disposition, a concern for human justice, and a lifelong interest in the works of Emanuel Swedenborg. He was inspired to pursue history, and, more specifically, anthropology by his reading of William H. Prescott, &quot;The Conquest of Mexico.&quot; Swanton attended local schools and then entered Harvard University, earning an AB in 1896, an AM in 1897, and a PhD in 1900. His mentor at Harvard was Frederic Ward Putnam, who sent him to study linguistics with Franz Boas at Columbia University in 1898 and 1899, as he worked on his PhD dissertation, &quot;The Morphology of the Chinook Verb&quot;.

==Career==
Within months of receiving his doctorate from Harvard, Swanton began working for the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, at which he continued for the duration of his career, spanning more than 40 years. Swanton first did fieldwork in the Northwest. In his early career, he worked mostly with the Tlingit and Haida. He produced two extensive compilations of Haida stories and myths, and transcribed many of them into Haida. These transcriptions have served as the basis for Robert Bringhurst&#x27;s translation of the poetry of Haida mythtellers Skaay and Ghandl. Swanton spent roughly a year with the Haida.

Another major study area was of the Muskogean-speaking peoples in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. Swanton published extensively on the Creek people, Chickasaw, and Choctaw. He also documented analyses about many other less well-known groups, such as the Biloxi, Ofo, and Tunica, the last of which supplemented earlier work by Albert Samuel Gatschet. He worked with Natchez speaker Watt Sam and argued in favor of including the Natchez language with the Muskogean language group.

Swanton wrote works including partial dictionaries, studies of linguistic relationships, collections of native stories, and studies of social organization. He worked with Earnest Gouge, a Creek who recorded a large number of traditional stories at Swanton&#x27;s request. These materials were never published by Swanton. They have recently been published online as &quot;Creek Folktales by Earnest Gouge&quot;, in a project by The College of William and Mary which includes some of the recordings by Gouge.

Swanton also worked with the Caddo, and published briefly on the quipu system of the Inca.

<doc id="754683" wikidata="Q16969697" url="?curid=754683" title="Gymnasium (Denmark)">
<text>The Danish gymnasium offers a 3-year general academically-oriented upper secondary programme which builds on the 9th-10th form of the &quot;Folkeskole&quot; and leads to the upper secondary school exit examination (the studentereksamen). This qualifies a student for admission to higher education Preparatory, subject to the special entrance regulations applying to the individual higher education programmes. Colloquially, &quot;gymnasium&quot; refers to what is formally called &quot;STX&quot;.

Apart from the common academic gymnasium, there are other types of occupation-oriented upper secondary education in Denmark. The main ones are &quot;højere handelseksamen&quot; or HHX (&quot;Higher Commercial Examination Programme&quot;), &quot;højere teknisk eksamen&quot; or HTX (&quot;Higher Technical Examination Programme&quot;), and &quot;højere forberedelseseksamen&quot; or HF (&quot;Higher Preparatory Examination Programme&quot;).

== Gymnasium ==
=== Types of Institutions ===
, an academically-oriented general upper secondary education which leads to an upper secondary school exit examination is offered at approximately 140 gymnasiums of varying size, distributed all over Denmark. the smallest gymnasium has 36 students, the largest 1470.

An upper secondary school leaving examination can also be taken within special 2-year courses for adult students.

=== Admission Requirements ===
In order to be admitted to the first year of the gymnasium, pupils must have completed the 10th year of primary school.
As the Danish Primary school goes from 0th to 9th (10 years in total)

All pupils that have received the relevant education and passed the prescribed examinations can continue to an upper secondary programme of more or less their own choosing.

Access, however, is not always automatically granted to general upper secondary programmes. If a school finds that the pupil and their parents are not taking the education and guidance provided seriously, and/or that there is a risk that the pupil will not be able to meet the requirements of the general upper secondary programmes, the pupil may be recommended to sit for an admission test to one of the general upper secondary programmes.

=== Subjects and Specialisation ===
When a student is admitted to a gymnasium, they choose a &quot;studieretning&quot; (&quot;specialized study programme&quot;) between a number of different programmes with different subjects. These subjects in these programmes are customised by the local school leadership. Each school has to offer at least 4 different programmes, with a least one focusing on mathematics and natural science, one focusing on foreign languages, and one focusing on social studies.

At a beginning of a course, students are divided into classes, usually based on their choice of line, and each student takes all their obligatory subjects together with their class, but with a different teacher for each subject.

A course of instruction lasts three years and comprises obligatory subjects common to all students, subjects that are part of the student&#x27;s study programme, and elective subjects. Many subjects can be studied at different levels, called A, B and C; A is the highest level which usually means the student has to study this subject for all three years of the gymnasium course.

The obligatory subjects for STX students are: classical studies (oldtidskundskab) (level C), religious studies (C), Danish (A), English (B), history (A), mathematics (B), physics (C), physical education (C), and social studies (C). In addition, while English is compulsory for all, each student also has to study another modern foreign language at either A or B level depending on whether it is taken continued or as beginner (the most common are German, French, Spanish and Italian). Continued language courses on B level are only available for German and French. The student is also required to study an artistic subject (e.g. music or visual arts) at level C, and two of the subjects biology (C), chemistry (C) and physical geography (C). Most of the obligatory subjects can be studied at a higher level if the student elects to do so.

The elective subjects are: astronomy, biology, biotechnology, business economics, chemistry, computer science, design, drama, Greek, media-subject, Latin, music, physical geography, philosophy, psychology, rhetorics, study of technology, visual arts, and others. It is also possible to study a third and even a fourth foreign language.

There are certain requirements as to how many subjects each student has to take and at how high levels. For instance, all students have to take at least four subjects at level A (there are two compulsory subjects at this the highest level: Danish and History), and all students have to take a natural science subject at level B.

In addition to the regular subjects there are also a couple of special subjects. The first one is called &quot;almen sprogforståelse&quot; which teaches a student general linguistics and gives the student the ability to analyze sentences. In addition to the general part of that subject there is also a Latin part which aims to give the student a very basic understanding of a Latin language. The idea of the subject is to form a basis for language related subjects throughout the gymnasium.

Another subject is &quot;almen studieforberedelse&quot;. The purpose of that subject is to introduce the student to a three main areas of study the gymnasium deals with: the humanities, social science and natural science. Furthermore, it aims to give a student knowledge about different methodology used by different faculties. Lessons encompass a combination of two or more of the student&#x27;s other subjects (e.g. Danish, history and physics). The student will learn to use the methodology theory it has learned to work with and solve complex problems.

==== The classical line ====
, approximately 15 gymnasiums (&quot;N. Zahle&#x27;s Gymnasium&quot;, &quot;Ribe Katedralskole&quot; and &quot;Thisted Gymnasium&quot; to name a few) offer the classical line (&quot;den klassiske linje&quot; or &quot;den klassisksproglige linje&quot;, &quot;the line of classical languages&quot;) consisting of Latin and Ancient Greek, the subjects of classical philology, at A level. The goal of the line is a thorough understanding of the languages, works, world view, etc. of the classical time period, and classical works (or parts of them) such as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Iliad&quot; and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; are often read in translation or in their original languages.

There is a tradition that students with Latin and/or Ancient Greek receive a black graduation cap instead of the standard white one when they graduate. This is a homage to older times when gymnasiums were known as &quot;Latin schools&quot; due to the prominent role of Latin at the time. The original graduation cap of this age was black, and thus it has become tradition for graduates with Latin and/or Ancient Greek to choose a black (albeit modern) version of the graduation cap (though a black cap in the original style is also an option). Other traditions regarding the black cap exist as well, but there are no official restrictions: Any graduating student may select a black graduation cap if he/she so wishes, but it is generally frowned upon, and there is even debate about the different traditions and about who should have the right to wear the black cap.

=== General Objectives ===
In continuation of the 9th form of the basic school, the gymnasium provides a 3-year course of continued general education. This covers the necessary basis for further studies and is completed by an examination (the upper secondary school exit examination). The upper secondary school exit examination, called &quot;studentereksamen&quot; in Danish, qualifies the student for admission to higher education, subject to regulations. The teaching must furthermore contribute to the pupils’ personal development and enlightenment, developing their interest in and ability to participate actively in a democratic society.

=== Instruction ===
At the commencement of the instruction, the teacher either prepares a plan for the autumn term&#x27;s teaching in collaboration with the students or informs the students of such a plan. In the later phases of the instruction, the teacher and the students plan the work together. The teacher and the students regularly discuss the instruction given. Instruction in the individual classes is co-ordinated with a view to achieving a coherence between the different subjects and a suitable distribution of the student&#x27;s workload.

The instruction is usually organised as a combination of lecture, group work, practical experiments, and homework.

=== Examination ===
Throughout the gymnasium the student will undergo various examinations. Examinations are usually either oral or written and in most cases the student is allowed to use all types of aids except for communication with other people. Some examinations allow preparation at home while others give a set amount of time for preparation at the gymnasium which is then immediately followed by the actual examination.

Some examinations are obligatory for all students (e.g. written Danish). Examinations in other subjects are chosen each year by the Ministry of Education for the individual student.

The students performance is marked according to &quot;syv-trins-skalaen&quot; (the seven-step-scale) and the student must receive at least 02 for the test to be considered passed.

=== Certification ===
The authority responsible for the content and examinations is the Ministry of Education.

The title of the examination taken at the end of the gymnasium is the &quot;studentereksamen&quot;. Students, who have passed the &quot;studentereksamen&quot;, are presented with a certificate, which contains the following information:

* all marks for the year&#x27;s work,
* examination marks, including marks for the years work in subjects in which there has been no examination,
* the two average figures,
* the examination result, etc.

The certificate is signed by the headmaster of the gymnasium where the examination has been taken. Certificates are drawn up by the Ministry of Education. Only one original certificate may be issued. A copy, including a translated certificate (the certificate is translated into English, German and French) must be designated &#x27;copy&#x27;.

=== Teachers ===
The students have different teachers for different subjects, and it is normal that these teachers stay with a class for an entire course. A teacher usually holds a combined master&#x27;s degree in two different subjects which are the only subjects which that teacher is qualified to teach. In addition to their university studies, newly employed teachers take a &quot;pædagogikum&quot; which since August 2009 is a one-year part-time course in pedagogy, having previously been a two-year course.

== History ==
The &quot;studentereksamen&quot; (originally named &quot;examen artium&quot;) was originally created in 1630 an entrance exam carried out by the University. Starting in 1850, gymnasiums (then called &quot;lærde skoler&quot; (&quot;learned schools&quot;) or &quot;latinskoler&quot; (&quot;Latin schools&quot;)) started examining the students. In 1871, the gymnasium education was divided into the mathematical-scientific and linguistic-historical lines of study. At the same time, the entrance exam at university for self-taught people was abolished. Women were not allowed to take the &quot;studentereksamen&quot; until 1875.

In 1903, the lines of study were changed to mathematical-scientific, modern-lingual, and classical-lingual, and the name of the schools was officially changed to gymnasium. From 1958 there were two lines of study, mathematical-scientific and linguistic, and after first year, the students had to choose between different branches (e.g. modern languages or classical languages). This system was however changed in 1988, where the students in their second year were able to choose more freely between a variety of subjects (a student could for instance have both a language and a scientific subject at the highest level, even if he had originally chosen the mathematical line of study).

The two line system was abolished in 2005 and the gymnasium was completely re-formed. More lines of study, decided by each gymnasium itself, were offered, and it was generally perceived to give a greater amount of customisability to the students. Instead of choosing a line of study when enrolling, the students now only let the school know what line they &quot;intend&quot; to choose, and the final decision is made after half a year of introduction to the different faculties (primarily the arts, languages and natural science). Furthermore, a wide range of general subjects, like for instance social studies, were made mandatory.

<text>The Higher Preparatory Examination (in Danish: Højere Forberedelseseksamen or HF) is a 2-year general upper secondary programme building on to the 10th form of the Folkeskole and leading to the higher preparatory examination (the HF-examination), which qualifies for admission to higher education, subject to the special entrance regulations applying to the individual higher education programmes.

== Types of institutions ==
There are approximately 75 institutions offering full-time programmes leading to the HF-examination. Most of them are attached to Gymnasiums (61) and mainly offer full-time 2-year programmes, some are attached to colleges of education, and about 75 adult education centres. The smallest HF-establishment has 40 students, the biggest 415 students (2001).

== Admission requirements ==
In order to be admitted to an HF-programme in one or more subjects, the student must have finished the basic school at least one year before admission. Students wishing to be admitted directly from the basic school must have completed the 10th year of the basic school. There are exceptions, an interview is held before admission where the interviewer, who is a representative from the school in question, can determine whether the student is eligible for admission, even if the student didn&#x27;t attend the 10th grade. To get admission to HF without finishing the 10th grade, you have to have gone to another school higher than the 9th grade as STX, HTX or HHX but without finishing them. This allows people who have the necessary abilities to finish HHX to get admission without having gone to 10th grade.

All pupils, who have received the relevant teaching and passed the prescribed examinations, can continue in an upper secondary programme more or less of their own choice.

Access is however not totally free to the general upper secondary programmes. If a school finds that the pupil and his or her parents do not take the guidance provided seriously, and that there is a risk that the pupil cannot meet the requirements of the general upper secondary programmes, the pupil may be recommended to sit for an admission test to one of the general upper secondary programmes.

== Levels and age groups ==
The HF-programme is a 2-year programme based on the 10th form of the Folkeskole. The teaching is divided into a 1st and a 2nd year.

The students have different teachers in the different subjects, and it is normal that these teachers stay with the class for the entire 2-year programme.

== General objectives ==
The programme leading to the HF-examination is intended to be a course of general education preparing adults and young people for further studies. The teaching contributes to the participants’ personal development, and to developing their interest in and ability to participate actively in a democratic society. The HF-examination qualifies the candidate for admission to higher education, subject to the restrictions appearing from the regulations laid down to this effect.

== Curriculum, subjects, number of hours ==
At the commencement of the instruction in a subject, the teacher either prepares a plan for the first term&#x27;s teaching in collaboration with the students or he informs the students of such a plan. In the later phases of the instruction, the teacher and the students plan the work together. The teacher and the students regularly discuss the instruction given. The options to be offered for examination are chosen in consultation with the students and must be approved by the Ministry of Education. The instruction in the individual class is coordinated with a view to achieving coherence between the various subjects and a suitable distribution of the students&#x27; workload.

A complete HF-examination consists of a cluster of common core subjects, three optional subjects and a major written assignment. The foreign languages can be taken at beginner level and continuation level, the latter requiring a certain previous knowledge.

== Methods ==
The instruction is provided in the form of class instruction in the individual subjects. There is project work in certain subjects, which will often be carried out in groups (group work).

The instruction must constitute a whole and must therefore be organised so that the subjects give mutual support to each other. The instruction in the individual class must be co-ordinated to ensure coherence between the subjects and a suitable distribution of the students&#x27; workload.

== Pupil evaluation ==
The students receive progress reports and grades throughout the two years and a final end-of-year or end-of-term examination is given in each subject of study.

Another important difference from the Gymnasium is that a complete HF-examination requires an examination in all subjects (except for visual arts, PE and sport and music at common core level). The examination takes place at the end of the year in which the instruction in the subject ends.

It is possible to omit sitting for an examination in a common core subject, if the subject in question has been chosen as an optional subject. This does not however apply to the common core subjects of mathematics and physics/chemistry, in which there will always be an examination.

Both written and oral examinations are held in the following subjects: Danish, English (optional), German/French (continuation level as optional subject), mathematics common core, mathematics optional, and in subjects chosen at high level.

In the remaining subjects, only oral examinations are held. Written examination questions are produced by the Ministry of Education&#x27;s Department of General Upper Secondary Education. For each subject, there is an examination committee consisting of hand- picked teachers and the Department&#x27;s subject advisers for the subject in question. Oral examinations are held in subjects selected (at random) by the Department of General Upper Secondary Education for each individual school.

Written examination papers are marked by two external examiners, i.e. the teacher has no share in the mark given, but is given two days to ask for a reconsideration of individual marks. At oral examinations, the teacher and one external examiner together decide on the mark to be given, where the external examiner has the last word.

For each subject, there is a permanent group of external examiners made up from teachers - with 5% of the members from other sectors of the education system or from industry.

== Certification ==

The responsible authority for the content and examinations is the Ministry of Education.

The title of the examination taken at the end of the HF-programme is the higher preparatory examination (). Students who have passed the examination are issued with a certificate, which contains the following information:

* 1) marks in common core subjects which have not also been chosen as optional subjects,
* 2) marks in optional subjects,
* 3) the mark for the major written assignment,
* 4) the average mark, calculated with one decimal.

The certificate is signed by the headmaster of the HF-establishment, where the examination has been taken. Certificates are drawn up by the Ministry of Education. Only one original certificate must be issued. A copy, including a translated certificate (the certificate also exists in English, German and French) must be designated &quot;copy&quot;.

Ministerial regulations have been issued with regard to the award of credits in connection with teaching and examinations for students who have followed the instruction and taken examinations from other programmes at upper secondary level.

<text>Richard Long (born ) is a former New Zealand broadcaster, initially with the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC), subsequently with Television New Zealand (TVNZ). He co-hosted the 6 pm Network News bulletins on TV One from 1988 until 19 December 2003, with co-anchor Judy Bailey. He was dropped from weekday news for six weeks in 1999, presenting weekend bulletins alongside Liz Gunn while Judy Bailey and John Hawkesby fronted the weekday bulletins, before TVNZ responded to public pressure and returned him the weekday spot alongside Bailey on 1 March 1999.

During his career at TVNZ he covered the Aramoana massacre in 1990, reporting live from the township, and with Bailey presented the memorial service for yachtsman Peter Blake in 2001. Long and Bailey were presenters of the year at the 2001 Qantas broadcasting awards.

TVNZ announced it would not renew Long&#x27;s contract on 22 October 2003, with head of news and current affairs Bill Ralston enacting cost-cutting measures and stating a desire to have a single newsreader format. He had an emotional departure on his last day, including an on-air send-off and an honour guard of TVNZ staff.

In 2007, Long provided voice-overs in Hanover Finance advertisements; the Commerce Commission investigated the commercials in 2008 for misleading statements. Long later expressed regret about voicing the advertisements, saying that he personally lost $50,000 investing in Hanover.

<doc id="754690" wikidata="Q7635804" url="?curid=754690" title="Sukhi Turner">
<text>Dame Sukhinder Kaur Gill Turner (born Sukhinder Kaur Gill, 13 April 1952), commonly known as Sukhi Turner, is a New Zealand politician who served as the Mayor of Dunedin, New Zealand, from 1995 until her retirement from the position in 2004. She was also regarded by some as New Zealand&#x27;s most prominent politician from the country&#x27;s Indian community.

==Early life==
Turner was born in Ludhiana, the largest city in the Indian state of Punjab, to Squadron Leader Jasbir Singh Gill and Premjit Kaur on 13 April 1952.

Born as Sukhinder Kaur Gill, she is a Sikh. She attended Bethany College, West Virginia, United States, gaining qualifications in history and political science. She moved to New Zealand after marrying Glenn Turner, a prominent New Zealand cricket player, in July 1973, and became a naturalised New Zealander in August 1973. Sukhi and Glenn Turner settled in Dunedin in 1982. They have two children.

==Political career==
Turner has taken part in a wide range of community work, focusing particularly on education. She has taken an active role in school committees and associations, and in 1992, successfully stood for election to the Dunedin City Council. After a three-year term on the council, Turner chose to contest the mayoralty, challenging long-serving incumbent Richard Walls. She was successful, and was subsequently re-elected twice. Her win over sitting mayor Richard Walls was reported on widely and she was noted for bringing diversity to the mayoralty, with Wellington newspaper &quot;The Evening Post&quot; stating of Turner &quot;Dunedin voters broke new ground. Their new mayor is a woman, an Indian and a Green.&quot; Turner announced that she would retire from the position in October 2004, when her third term expired. She was replaced by Peter Chin.

In 1993, Turner was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

==Life after politics==
In the 2002 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Turner was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to local government. Following the reinstatement of titular honours by the New Zealand government in 2009, she accepted redesignation as a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

In early 2004, Turner was among the recipients of the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, an award given by the Indian government to honour those who have made a significant contribution to Indian immigrant communities in other countries.

<doc id="754692" wikidata="Q3817741" url="?curid=754692" title="Higher Technical Examination Programme">
<text>In Denmark, the Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX, in Danish: &quot;Højere Teknisk Eksamen&quot;) is a 3-year vocationally oriented general upper secondary programme which builds on the 10th-11th form of the Folkeskole education system. It leads to the higher technical examination, the HTX-examination, which permits a student to qualify for admission to higher education, subject to the special entrance regulations that apply to the individual course. The programme gives special attention to scientific, technical and communicative subjects.
HTX graduates may study at any Danish technical, scientific or traditional university as well as technical and technological academy (&quot;akademi&quot;) or college (&quot;professionshøjskole&quot;).

== HTX-programme ==
The aim of the programme is to give the students a general and technical upper secondary education, which through theoretical and workshop-related teaching, qualifies the students for admission to higher education. The programme furthermore provides a partial basis for occupational employment and qualifies the student for a reduction of the schooling period in a vocational education and training programme.

The HTX-programme is a 3-year programme. The introductory 6-month semester details the aims of the secondary school period of the vocational education and training programmes offered by the college.

The programme caters to the 16 to 19-year-old bracket and is divided into years with a certain number of obligatory and optional subjects of both a general and a vocational nature. Students may have the same teacher for different subjects throughout the programme.

The programme builds on the 9th form of the Folkeskole education system or a corresponding qualification and is of 3 years&#x27; duration. The school organises the teaching so that the aims of individual subjects are met, before the students are to be examined in the subject. Each student completes their own final project.

The 3-year HTX-programme builds on to the 10th year of the Folkeskole education system or similar education.

All pupils that have received the relevant education and passed the prescribed examination(s) can continue in an upper secondary programme of more or less their own choice.

Access, however, is not automatically available to the general upper secondary programmes. If a school finds that the pupil and their parents are not taking the education and guidance provided seriously, and/or that there is a risk that the pupil will not be able to meet the requirements of the general upper secondary programmes, the pupil may be recommended to sit for an admission test to one of the general upper secondary programmes.

===History===
The HTX Programme was established in 1982 by the Ministry of Education as an experiment to oblige the rising demand for more technical and scientific educated labour in Denmark at the time.
Before 1982 there were only three ways to get a university degree in the Danish education system; through the ‘Gymnasium (STX)’, ‘Higher Preparatory Examination (HF)’ or ‘Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX)’. Of those, only the Gymnasium could lead directly to a technical university education, but it wasn&#x27;t a wholesome way since there were a lot of mandatory subjects which was of no use at a technical university education (classical studies [Danish: oldtidskundskab], religious studies, history, and physical education). None of those oriented in special only to the scientific, technical and communicative subjects, which in a more and more globalised Denmark began to matter a great deal. The labour market was experiencing downturns due to great changes in the Danish business sector, where Denmark&#x27;s role in the world was shifting from a productive industrial country (like China), to a more service-industrial country, with research and &quot;production of knowledge&quot; becoming the most vital markets. To be compatible with the rest of the world, more engineers and scientists needed to be educated.

This was where the Higher Technical Examination Programme entered the picture. HTX was then only offered as a 2½-year programme, which only gave admission to certain technical educations, like bachelor engineer (Danish: teknikumingeniør) and civil engineer (Danish: civilingeniør) in construction. As an experimental programme, the HTX was using the most modern method of teaching, and a lot of interdisciplinary group- and project-work to imitate situations that students would encounter in the real world – something that wasn&#x27;t being done a great deal in gymnasia. The programme also quickly adapted computer technology for use in the education like mathematics. The main subjects were of course chemistry, biology, physics and mathematics, and the education was on the same level as the gymnasium, without the unnecessary subjects.
The programme was a great success. As the experimental phase was being closed in 1988, the HTX programme was to become a fully integrated part of the Danish education system. It began to spread throughout the Danish education system, and was offered at the most technically oriented vocational secondary schools (Danish: tekniske erhvervsskoler) before long. The programme though had image problems as it was somehow regarded a &quot;geek-school&quot; because of the great deal of technical and scientific subjects that didn&#x27;t attract female attention, which caused the HTX programme to be very male-dominated in the first years.

On 1 January 1991, the subjects were divided into A, B and C levels, which for that reason removed the last thing that kept the HTX programme from being a complete academically oriented upper secondary education equal to the gymnasium. The HTX programme was now also extended to 3 full years of studying, with a final exam in the A-level subjects at the last year. From now on, the HTX programme could lead to any university education, but still with focus on the technical and scientific subjects, and less on the humanist subjects, though it was also possible to take optional subjects (like design and psychology) that may give access to some humanist university educations. Some new unique subjects to be found only at the HTX programme, like the &quot;technique-subject&quot; (Danish: teknikfag), technology and history of technology were introduced. At the same time, the mandatory level of chemistry, physics and mathematics was set a level higher (B-level) than at the gymnasium (C-level), which meant that an HTX graduate, unlike an STX graduate, automatically had admission to any technical university education.

In 2005, there was a gymnasium reform. The gymnasium, the HHX programme and the HTX programme were now fully equal, which means that they have the same optional subjects, and they have adopted some of each other&#x27;s strengths to make a fully integrated academically oriented upper secondary education. For example, the 3 programmes have very similar 6-month introduction semesters (&quot;grundforløb&quot;), which make it easy to shift between the 3 programmes to find the most suitable for one. Furthermore, the subject &quot;history of technology&quot; was made obligatory at C-level.

In 2007 the Ministry of Education revised the &quot;Gymnasium-reform&quot;, and introduced biotechnology as a new optional subject, which until 2009 is offered only as an experiment.

=== Specialization, subjects and levels ===
The HTX programme is based on technical and scientific subjects at the highest mandatory level offered in Denmark. Furthermore, it is as well based on a wide range of optional subjects similar to those found in the Gymnasium or at the HHX programme. Some of the optional subjects are business, economics, work environment, history of technology, international technology and culture, information technology, material technology, design, statistics, quality control, etc.

The subjects can be taken at 3 levels: A, B and C, with A as the highest level and usually a studying time of 3 years. The students choose at least three A-level, three B-level, and one C-level subjects to meet the requirements for a full HTX-exam diploma.

The new students who are admitted, begins at the Programme in August every year, in the so-called &quot;1st g&quot; (Danish: første g). The first half year is spent at an &quot;introductory semester&quot; (&quot;grundforløb&quot;) where the students are randomly selected into classes, with an emphasis on the students&#x27; selected line of study. Here they receive education in Danish, English, mathematics, physics, chemistry, technology and information technology to ensure that the students are all equally prepared. The biggest differences between the new students are in mathematics, where basic needs are taught (like solving equations and algebra).
The introductory course is finished with an obligatory &quot;portfolio examination&quot;, whose purpose is to make clear (to both the teachers and the student) how and what the student has learned over the past half year of introduction to the HTX programme. The duration of the exam is 20 minutes.

Before Christmas, the students must have chosen their desired &#x27;line of study&#x27; (&quot;studielinje&quot;). A line of study is a compilation of subjects at different levels, all of which adhere to the minimal requirements of the HTX-exam. This is the final, binding choice, which forms the programme with some differences depending on study specialization.
A line of study consist of 2 subjects chosen by the school, and one subject with relevance chosen by voting among the pupils. This may, however, vary between schools throughout the country.
If a subject is included in a line of study, its level will be raised. C-level will be raised to B, and B-level to A. If the subject is not mandatory, it will be included as a C-level subject. For instance, English is mandatory at B-level, but if it is in a line of study, it is raised to an A-level.
But there are 2 major exceptions: Communication/IT will be raised from C-level to A-level, and Design will be a B-level subject even though it is not a mandatory subject.

Most of the schools offer at least 3 different lines of study, namely:

*&quot;Natural Science&quot; with Mathematics A and Physics A, Chemistry A or Biotechnology A
*&quot;Technical&quot; with Technology A and another relevant subject
*&quot;Communicative&quot; with Communication/IT A and English A or Design B

In the last year of the programme, the students are obliged to choose one of three rather unusual &quot;Area of technical specialization&quot; at level A. In this subject the students spend an entire day at working with specialization. The choice of Area of technical specialization decides the specialization indicated in the certificate. The students can choose between the following specialisations:

*Construction and energy (a subject with emphasis on real-world construction of buildings.)
*Design and production (a subject with emphasis on the design and production of electronics.)
*Process, food and health (a subject with emphasis on chemical processes with regard to the production of consumables.)

=== Methods ===
The teaching is based on vocational theory and method and on practical vocational conditions. The aim of the course to be a preparation for higher education studies must be reflected in the organisation of the teaching. Teaching methods included develop the independence of the students and their ability to argue, generalise and make abstractions.

The teaching is organised so that the subjects support each other with a view to creating an appropriate and equal distribution of the workload of students.

When attending to the HTX programme, one must expect that a great part of the work is done in groups, and that there will be a lot of interdisciplinary projects, too. Although there is also common class education, and lectures in different subjects.

The incorporation of computers is very visible, as over 90% of all students bring their laptop to school for taking notes, calculate (students will get education in programs like MathCad, AutoCAD, Maple and SmartSketch), draw etc. It&#x27;s not a requirement, but it&#x27;s a big advantage to have a laptop at the HTX programme. Most schools are able to lend laptops to students who haven&#x27;t got one themselves.

=== Pupil evaluation ===
Students are given marks for the year&#x27;s work on the basis of their performance in class and their homework.

As a rule, the examinations are held at the end of the programme. A student can normally only be registered for the examination if they have participated in the instruction, and have handed in required written work and had it approved by the teachers concerned.

Oral and/or written examinations are held in almost all of the subjects. The students&#x27; performance at the examination is assessed by the teacher/examiner and external examiner(s) appointed by the Ministry of Education.

=== Certification ===
When the students have completed all the examinations at the end of the 3rd year, the school issues a certificate indicating all the marks obtained by the students at the examination and in the year&#x27;s work.

The Ministry of Education decides on the design of the certificate.

<doc id="754694" wikidata="Q339593" url="?curid=754694" title="Richard Long (actor)">
<text>Richard McCord Long (December 17, 1927 – December 21, 1974), also known as Dick Long, was an American actor best known for his leading roles in three ABC television series, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot;, and &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;. He was also a series regular on ABC&#x27;s &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; during the 1961–1962 season.

==Career==
===Early films: International Pictures===
In 1946, Long was cast in his first film, &quot;Tomorrow Is Forever&quot;, as Drew, the son of the characters played by Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles. The role had been unfilled for months, and producers selected Long, who most closely matched the credentials required. It was made by International Pictures, which put him under contract.

Long impressed Welles, who cast the actor in &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946), from International, as the younger brother of Loretta Young&#x27;s character.

International was going to lend Long to 20th Century Fox to make &quot;Margie&quot; (1946), but then they changed their minds and put him in &quot;The Dark Mirror&quot; (1946) starring Olivia de Havilland and Thomas Mitchell and directed by Robert Siodmak.

===Tom Kettle and Universal Pictures===
International Pictures merged with Universal Pictures, which took over Long&#x27;s contract. His fourth film was &quot;The Egg and I&quot; (1947), playing Tom Kettle, the eldest son of Ma and Pa Kettle, the characters played by Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride. The movie was a huge hit – so much so that Universal decided to spin off the Kettles into their own series.

Long signed a contract with Universal, for which he appeared in &quot;Tap Roots&quot; (1948) and &quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1949), playing Burt Lancaster&#x27;s brother in the latter for Siodmak. He supported William Bendix in &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; (1949) based on the NBC radio show.

Long reprised his role as Tom Kettle in &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; (1949), which was a solid success at the box office. So, too, was &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town&quot; (1950). He was Frank James in the Western &quot;Kansas Raiders&quot; (1950).

In December 1950, Long was drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War. Before he left, he made &quot;Jet Men of the Air&quot; (1951), and then served for two years at Fort Ord, California.

&quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm&quot; (1952) was Long&#x27;s fourth and final Kettle movie. He was the juvenile lead in &quot;Back at the Front&quot; (1952) and had supporting parts in &quot;All I Desire&quot; (1953), &quot;All American&quot; (1953) (as the villain to Tony Curtis&#x27;s hero), &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; (1954), and &quot;Playgirl&quot; (1954).

Long began guest-starring on TV shows such as &quot;Lux Video Theater&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Love Again&quot;) and was finally given a lead role by Universal in &quot;Cult of the Cobra&quot; (1955) – though still billed under Faith Domergue.

===Television===
Long focused on television over the next few years, guest-starring on episodes of shows such as &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;, &quot;TV Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Hey, Jeannie!&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Suspicion&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;The Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Matinee Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episodes (&quot;Number 12 Looks Just Like You&quot; and &quot;Person or Persons Unknown&quot;), and &quot;The Further Adventures of Ellery Queen&quot;.

At Columbia, he had a top supporting role in the Western &quot;Fury at Gunsight Pass&quot; (1956) and in a Blake Edwards comedy, &quot;He Laughed Last&quot; (1956).

Long went to Japan to star in &quot;Tokyo After Dark&quot; (1959) and had a key role in William Castle&#x27;s &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; (1959).

===&quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;===
Long signed a contract with Warner Bros. and guest-starred in many of their TV series, including &quot;Lawman&quot;.
He played the recurring role of gambler/con artist Gentleman Jack Darby in four episodes of the ABC/WB Western series, &quot;Maverick&quot; beginning in 1958, including the memorable &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres&quot; installment. His character always interacted with Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick, including in &quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres&quot;, which starred both James Garner and Kelly. He also never appeared with later series regular Roger Moore. Gentleman Jack Darby was created by &quot;Maverick&quot; producer Roy Huggins as a replacement for &quot;Dandy Jim Buckley&quot;, played by Efrem Zimbalist Jr., after Zimbalist had moved on to his own series, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;.

Warner Bros. starred Long in a show, &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot; (1959–60) as Rex Randolph, Private Eye, which only ran for 39 episodes. with Andrew Duggan, Van Williams, and Arlene Howell.

===&quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;===
Long reprised his character on episodes of &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; and joined the cast of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; from 1960 to 1962.

Long continued to guest star on shows such as &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;Person or Persons Unknown&quot;).

He returned to films with a role in the MGM romantic musical &quot;Follow the Boys&quot;, along with co-stars Connie Francis, Paula Prentiss, and Roger Perry. He did &quot;The Tenderfoot&quot; (1964) for &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;.

In 1963, Long guest-starred in the episode &quot;Hear No Evil&quot; of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Going My Way&quot;, a drama series starring Gene Kelly about a Catholic priest in New York City loosely based on the 1944 Bing Crosby movie. That same year, he was cast as Eddie Breech in the episode &quot;Blood Bargain&quot; of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;.

Long went to Finland to make a film, &quot;Make Like a Thief&quot; (1965), which he also helped direct. &quot;I&#x27;ve had the longest awkward period in the history of Hollywood&quot;, he said around this time. &quot;I sign more autographs than anyone in the industry. They either think I&#x27;m Robert Goulet, Gig Young, Robert Sterling, or myself. We don&#x27;t look a thing alike if we&#x27;re together, but there is a flash similarity.&quot;

Long added that he hoped to play more character parts. &quot;I&#x27;m rotting from the inside out and it&#x27;s just gotten to my face&quot;, he said. &quot;A man doesn&#x27;t get interesting on screen until his 40s.&quot;

===&quot;The Big Valley&quot;===

In 1965, at the age of 38, Long began his role as attorney Jarrod Barkley, the oldest son of rancher Victoria Barkley (Barbara Stanwyck), in 112 episodes of &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, the last of the major Four Star Television series, a Western that ran on ABC from 1965 to 1969. The series was set in the 1870s. Long also directed 2 episodes of &quot;The Big Valley&quot;. (In 1953, Long had costarred with Stanwyck in the film &quot;All I Desire&quot;.)

===&quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot;===

In 1970–71, Long and Juliet Mills starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot;.

Long and Mills later provided their voices for two animated-film versions of the show: &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot; (1972) and &quot;Nanny and the Professor and the Phantom of the Circus&quot; (1973).

===&quot;Thicker Than Water&quot;===
In 1973, he starred alongside Julie Harris in the short-lived series, &quot;Thicker than Water&quot;.

His last jobs were the TV movies &quot;The Girl Who Came Gift-Wrapped&quot; (1974) and &quot;Death Cruise&quot; (1974).

==Personal life==
Long served in the U.S. Army for two years during the Korean War, where he was posted to Fort Ord, California, alongside actors Martin Milner, David Janssen, and Clint Eastwood. He was also stationed in Tokyo, Japan.

Long was twice married: his first wife, singer and actress Suzan Ball, who he married April 11, 1954, died of cancer 14 months later, at age 22. They had met in 1953, after her cancer diagnosis; her right leg was amputated in early 1954 and they married in April.

In 1957, he married actress/model Mara Corday in Las Vegas. The couple had three children together. In 1961, Long was arrested by police after Corday accused him of attacking her while drunk. Corday declined to pursue the charges, and after initially indicating she would file for divorce, she later reconciled with Long.
==Death==
As a youth, Long contracted pneumonia, which apparently weakened his heart. He later experienced cardiac problems as an adult and suffered his first heart attack in 1961. After a month-long stay in Tarzana Medical Center in Los Angeles to treat additional attacks, he died on December 21, 1974, four days after his 47th birthday.

<doc id="754707" wikidata="Q1185158" url="?curid=754707" title="Miguel Tejada">
<text>Miguel Odalis Tejada ( Tejeda; born May 25, 1974) is a Dominican former professional baseball shortstop who played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for six teams, most notably the Oakland Athletics and Baltimore Orioles, before short stints with the Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants, and Kansas City Royals.

Tejada spent his first six seasons in MLB with the Athletics, where he began a streak of 1,152 consecutive games that ended with the Orioles on June 22, 2007. He is a six-time All-Star and a two-time Silver Slugger Award winner. In 2002, he won the American League Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, and was the 2005 All-Star Game MVP. Tejada&#x27;s nickname is &quot;La Guagua&quot;, which means &quot;the bus&quot; in certain Spanish dialects, after his ability to drive in runs.

On February 11, 2009, he pleaded guilty to one count of perjury for lying to Congress in his testimony on whether Rafael Palmeiro lied about his steroid use. On August 17, 2013, MLB suspended Tejada for 105 games for violating MLB drug policy. It was the third-longest non-lifetime suspension ever issued by MLB for a drug-related violation.

==Early life==
Tejada grew up in extreme poverty in Baní, a city about 40 miles (65 km) southwest of Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. He grew up idolizing the Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr.

==Professional career==

===Oakland Athletics (1997–2003)===

====1997–2001====
Tejada developed quickly into a top-notch prospect, showing early signs of power. He reached the Majors towards the end of the 1997 season, joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A&#x27;s saw potential in the 23-year-old Tejada. This was bolstered by his performance with the Edmonton Trappers (AAA) in the Pacific Coast League during the season, and returning to the minors to lead the Trappers to a PCL championship that year. He was rewarded with the starting shortstop job beginning in 1998.

The A&#x27;s, and Tejada, steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11 home runs and in 1999 his average jumped to .251 with 21 home runs.

After a solid 87-win campaign in 1999, Tejada and a core of young players led their A&#x27;s to their first American League Western Division title in eight years in 2000. Bolstered by an American League MVP-winning performance by first baseman Jason Giambi, and aided by Tejada&#x27;s .275 average and 30 home runs, the A&#x27;s won 91 games. The A&#x27;s faced the New York Yankees in the first round of the postseason, which was won by the Yankees 3–2.

In 2001, Tejada had a comparable offensive year, hitting .267 with 31 homers. The A&#x27;s captured the American League wild card with a 102–60 record. In the postseason, however, the A&#x27;s fell to the Yankees in five games, blowing an initial 2–0 series lead.

====2002====
Tejada&#x27;s breakout year came in 2002. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the New York Yankees during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger Jermaine Dye, the A&#x27;s lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 34 homers and led the A&#x27;s to their second Western Division title in three years. Their campaign included an American League record 20 game winning-streak. Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games of that run: a three-run homer off Minnesota Twins closer Eddie Guardado for a 7–5 victory and a bases-loaded single against Kansas City Royals reliever Jason Grimsley to break a 6–6 tie. His regular season performance was rewarded with the 2002 American League MVP award. For the third straight year, though, the A&#x27;s fell in the fifth game of the ALDS, this time to the Minnesota Twins.

====2003====
The next year, both the A&#x27;s and Tejada got off to a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under .200 for the first month of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A&#x27;s to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops.

In a tension-filled series, the powerful offense of the Boston Red Sox narrowly edged out the A&#x27;s in the first round, once again in five games. Tejada was known for his public display of anger toward Boston starting pitcher Derek Lowe at the series&#x27; conclusion for what he perceived as obscene gestures. Lowe denied the accusation, claiming his fist pump was in celebration only.

===Baltimore Orioles (2004–2007)===
By the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself as one of baseball&#x27;s premier shortstops. The A&#x27;s elected not to re-sign the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young Bobby Crosby coming through the system, so Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles during the offseason.

On arrival in Baltimore, Tejada was given uniform number 10, since 4, his number in Oakland, had been retired for former manager Earl Weaver. As an Oriole, Tejada followed in the footsteps of legendary Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. Like Ripken, Tejada was a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle infielder.

====2004–2005====
On July 12, 2004, Tejada won the Century 21 Home Run Derby in Houston. Tejada hit a (then) record 27 home runs in the contest, including a record 15 homers in the second round. He defeated Houston Astros outfielder Lance Berkman (who would later become his teammate) 5–4 in the final round of the contest. Both records were broken the following year in Detroit by Bobby Abreu. Tejada finished the 2004 season with 34 home runs and an MLB-leading 150 RBIs, and won his first career Silver Slugger Award.

While Tejada did not participate in the Home Run Derby in 2005, he was an All-Star and starter for the AL. In his first All-Star start, Tejada hit a solo home run against John Smoltz of the Atlanta Braves, had a sacrifice RBI and was part of an all-Oriole double play with teammate Brian Roberts. His efforts earned him the All-Star MVP, winning a Chevrolet Corvette.

====2005–2006 offseason====
In the winter of 2005, Tejada asked the Orioles for a trade, citing unhappiness with the team&#x27;s direction, while commenting briefly on his alleged non-involvement in Palmeiro&#x27;s steroid scandal. Weeks would go by before Tejada relented on the idea of being traded away, although the Orioles would later try to offload him during the 2006 All-Star break (with the Los Angeles Angels being one of the teams that failed to meet the asking price).

====2006–2007====
Tejada played in his 1,000th consecutive game on July 1, 2006.

Tejada&#x27;s streak was at 1,151 games when he was hit on his left wrist by a pitch on June 20, 2007. The next day, he went up to bunt in the top of the first inning, bunted into a force play, and was replaced by a pinch runner. Following that game, it was announced that he had a broken wrist. On June 22 he was placed on the disabled list, ending his streak at 1,152 consecutive games, the fifth longest in Major League history, behind Cal Ripken Jr. (2,632), Lou Gehrig (2,130), Everett Scott (1,307), and Steve Garvey (1,217).

===Houston Astros (2008–2009)===
On December 12, 2007, Tejada was dealt to the Houston Astros for five players, including SP Troy Patton, OF Luke Scott, RP Dennis Sarfate and RP/SP Matt Albers.

Tejada scored his 1,000th career run on July 7, 2008, at PNC Park. In the 2008 All-Star Game Tejada singled leading off the top of the eighth stole second with one out and advanced to third on a throwing error and scored on Padres&#x27; first baseman Adrián González&#x27;s sacrifice fly.

In the 2008 season he grounded into 32 double plays, the most in the major leagues. In 2009, he again led the majors in grounding into double plays, this time with 29. He became the first player in major league history to lead the league in double plays grounded into five times.

===Second stint with the Orioles (2010)===
On January 23, 2010, Tejada agreed to a one-year deal worth $6 million with the Orioles.

===San Diego Padres (2010)===
On July 29, the Orioles traded Tejada to the San Diego Padres for minor league pitcher Wynn Pelzer. On September 22, Tejada hit his 300th career home run off Ted Lilly of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

===San Francisco Giants (2011)===

Tejada signed a one-year, $6.5 million, contract with the San Francisco Giants. He was designated for assignment on August 31, 2011 after batting .239 with four home runs and 26 RBIs in 91 games. He was released on September 8, 2011.

===Third stint with the Orioles===
On May 6, 2012, Tejada reached an agreement on a contract with the Orioles. He failed to make the Major League club&#x27;s roster however, and played for their Triple-A affiliate Norfolk team until requesting his outright release, which was granted on June 25, 2012.

===Kansas City Royals (2013)===

On December 31, 2012, Tejada signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. According to the Associated Press, he was to earn $1.1 million plus performance incentives worth an additional $400,000 if he made the Royals Major League 40-man roster for 2013.

On August 17, 2013, Tejada received a 105-game suspension from Major League Baseball following two positive drug tests for amphetamines. Tejada claimed to have been in the process of re-applying for a therapeutic use exemption as he used the drug to treat a medical condition, but he chose not to appeal the decision. Due to a calf injury suffered prior to the ban, Tejada was not likely to play in the remaining 41 games of the 2013 season anyway, though they counted toward his suspension. He also was not allowed to play in the first 64 games of the 2014 season.

===Miami Marlins===
On May 16, 2014, Tejada signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. Tejada was required to serve the remaining 64 games left on his suspension before being available to be called up by the Marlins. On August 2, Tejada was released by the Marlins.

===Pericos de Puebla===
On April 4, 2015, Tejada signed with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League. In 105 games he hit .324/.368/.446 with 7 home runs, 70 RBIs and 1 stolen base.

Tejada was eligible to be elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5% of the vote and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot. In August 2024, he was elected to the Oakland Athletics Hall of Fame.

===Career statistics===
In 2171 games over 16 seasons, Tejada posted a career .285 batting average (2407-for-8434) which includes 1230 runs, 468 doubles, 23 triples, 307 home runs, 1302 RBI, 85 stolen bases, 553 walks, .336 on-base percentage, and .456 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded an overall .971 fielding percentage primarily as a shortstop.

==Controversies==

===Steroid allegations and suspensions===
On September 22, 2005, ESPN reported that Rafael Palmeiro, who had tested positive for steroids and was suspended for 10 games under Major League Baseball&#x27;s steroid policy, implicated Tejada to baseball&#x27;s arbitration panel, suggesting that a supplement given to him by Tejada was responsible for the steroid entering his system. Tejada denied the allegations, saying that the only thing he gave Palmeiro was vitamin B-12, a legal substance under MLB policy.

On September 24, 2005, the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that &quot;The Health Policy Advisory Committee, which oversees baseball&#x27;s testing policy, issued a statement that exonerated Tejada and chastised the media for reporting that he might have distributed steroids to another player.&quot;

In José Canseco&#x27;s 2005 book, &quot;&quot;, he mentioned that he believed Tejada might have taken steroids. He claims to have spoken to him about them and the next season seeing him at spring training looking more defined. He never claims to have injected him with them, like he did with Palmeiro, McGwire, and other ballplayers.

On September 30, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that former relief pitcher Jason Grimsley, during a June 6, 2006, federal raid, told federal agents investigating steroids in baseball named Tejada as a user of &quot;anabolic steroids.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; reported that Tejada was one of five names blacked out in an affidavit filed in federal court. However, on October 3, 2006, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that San Francisco United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report contained &quot;significant inaccuracies.&quot; Tejada, along with the other four players named, denounced the story.

On December 13, 2007, Tejada was mentioned in the Mitchell Report in connection to steroids. In the report, Tejada is said to have received $1,500 worth of steroids.

A report surfaced on January 15, 2008, stating that Rep. Henry Waxman had asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Tejada was truthful when speaking to the House committee when being interviewed in 2005 regarding possible connections to Rafael Palmeiro.

On February 10, 2009, Tejada was charged with lying to Congress about performance-enhancing drug usage in Major League Baseball. On February 11, Tejada pleaded guilty to charges that he lied to Congress in 2005. He faced up to one year in federal prison and deportation. On March 26, 2009, he received one-year probation.

On August 17, 2013, Tejada was suspended 105 games for testing positive twice for amphetamines, specifically the prescription medication adderall. Tejada claimed he had medical permission from MLB to use the drug to treat ADD, but it expired on April 15, 2013, and he continued to use it without gaining a new permission from MLB. The suspension was the third-longest non-lifetime ban issued by MLB for a drug violation.

===Age===
On April 17, 2008, Tejada was confronted by an ESPN reporter during a sit-down interview with documentation revealing that Tejada had been lying about his age ever since he first signed a Major League Baseball contract in 1993. Tejada had claimed to have been born in 1976 when a Dominican birth certificate showed that he was born in 1974 as &quot;Miguel Tejeda.&quot; He struggled to take off his microphone and kept questioning who the interviewer was referring to. Tejada stormed off the set, ending the interview. Before the interview was aired on April 22, 2008, he acknowledged having been born in 1974.

==Post-playing career==
On June 5, 2023, Tejada was appointed the manager of the Karachi Monarchs, a Pakistan-based franchise in the Baseball United league, which plans to bring baseball to South Asia and the Middle East.

On February 10, 2025, Tejada was hired to serve as the bench coach for the Bravos de León of the Mexican League.

==Personal life==
Tejada has a chicken farm in Florida where he lives with his wife, Alejandra, and his daughter, Alexa. His son, Miguel Jr., was a shortstop in the Philadelphia Phillies organization.

Tejada was childhood friends with Mario Encarnación and, when Encarnación died in Taiwan in 2005, Tejada paid for his body to be transported back to the Dominican Republic and for a headstone at a cemetery in Baní.

On August 20, 2015, Reorg Research reported that Tejada had filed for bankruptcy.

<text>The tawny eagle (Aquila rapax) is a large bird of prey. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family &quot;Accipitridae&quot;. Its heavily feathered legs mark it as a member of the subfamily Aquilinae, also known as booted eagles. Tawny eagles have an extensive but discontinuous breeding range that constitutes much of the African continent as well as the Indian subcontinent, with rare residency in the southern Middle East. Throughout its range, it favours open dry habitats such as semideserts, deserts steppes, or savanna plains. Despite its preference for arid areas, the species seldom occurs in areas where trees are entirely absent. It is a resident breeder which lays one to three eggs in a stick nest most commonly in the crown of a tree. The tawny eagle is perhaps the most highly opportunistic of all Aquilinae, and often scavenges on carrion or engages in kleptoparasitism towards other carnivorous animals but is also a bold and active predator, often of relatively large and diverse prey. It is estimated that tawny eagles can reach the age of 16 years old. Nonetheless, precipitous declines have been detected throughout the tawny eagle&#x27;s range. Numerous factors, particularly loss of nesting habitat due to logging and global warming, as well as persecution (largely via poisoning) and other anthropogenic mortality (largely through contact with various manmade objects) are driving the once numerous tawny eagle perhaps to the brink of extinction.

==Taxonomy==
Dutch naturalist Coenraad Jacob Temminck described the tawny eagle in 1828 from an Indian type specimen. &quot;Tawny eagle&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). &quot;Aquila&quot; is Latin for “eagle” while &quot;rapax&quot; is also Latin for “to grasp”, and relates to the word rapacious, i.e. highly predatory. The tawny eagle is a member of the booted eagle subfamily (&quot;Aquilinae&quot;) within the Accipitridae family. The booted eagle clan are monophyletic and study of karyotypes has indicated that they likely have few to no close external relations within the overall extant accipitrid family. The booted eagle subfamily all have feathers covering their legs and are distributed in every continent that contains accipitrids. The genus &quot;Aquila&quot; has been traditionally defined as largish, dark-hued and long-winged eagles of open country. However, study of genetics have resulted in several reclassifications. These include the moving of smaller, paler and more forest-dwelling eagles in &quot;Aquila&quot;, the separation of the unique spotted eagles to the genus &quot;Clanga&quot; as well as the division of some small eagles to the genus &quot;Hieraeetus&quot; outside of &quot;Aquila&quot;. Furthermore, genetic research has further revealed a schism in superficially similar eagles between the tawny eagle and its close relatives and other superficially similar &quot;Aquila&quot; such as the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) species complex. To date, the tawny eagle species group and golden eagle species group are still contained in the same genus despite the apparent lack of close relation.

The tawny eagle was previously treated as conspecific with the migratory steppe eagle (&quot;Aquila nipalensis&quot;). These eagles were considered part of the same species as recently as 1991. The steppe and tawny eagles were split based on pronounced differences in morphology and anatomy. The steppe eagle is a larger bird, with a much more pronounced gape, and differs by appearance in its blockier frame, bigger wings and evinces different coloring at all stages of development, despite some morphs of the two eagles superficially resembling one another. Furthermore, the respective species differ in ecology (dietary biology, nesting habits) and are strongly allopatric in their breeding ground distribution. Two molecular studies, each based on a very small number of genes, indicate that the species are distinct, but disagree over how closely related they are. Genetically, the tawny eagle may cluster more closely with the imperial eagle species complex despite the steppe eagle being more sympatric with those northerly Eurasian eagles.

===Subspecies===

There are three described races of tawny eagles. The subspecific classification of the species has at times been considered complicated by variations and existence of different morphs; in turn they were once considered tentative. However, each subspecies is largely allopatric in geography, the primary ambiguities lying in the northern part of east Africa where both African races may intergrade.

*&quot;A. r. rapax&quot;; distributed in Africa from the southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and central Kenya to all points southwards. However, this race may range up to as far north as Ethiopia as well (thus likely intergrading considerably with the following subspecies which is widespread in Ethiopia). Adult often of this nominate subspecies are often relatively more strongly rufous in colour than other races and are sometimes dark streaked below. Meanwhile, the juvenile tends to be light rufous. wing chord lengths in this race have been measured at in males and in females. The mean wing chord length in two samples of &quot;A. r. rapax&quot; measured in males and in females. The tail length of both sexes in &quot;A. r. rapax&quot; measures with a tarsus length of . Body mass can range roughly from in overall samples of at least 36 eagles.
*&quot;A. r. belisarius&quot;; this race resides in west Africa to Ethiopia and southwest Arabia as well as far south as the northern Democratic Republic of the Congo and northern Kenya. This race is described to appear &quot;neater&quot; than the nominate subspecies, possibly due to this race often occurring in even more desert-like conditions than the other races and thus having more compact feathering. It is when compared to the nominate, often duller and browner above, showing less of a rufous tinge. Meanwhile, individual pale morph of &quot;A. r. belisarius&quot; often a shade or two darker than pale nominate but not consistently so. Although said to be slightly larger, measurement data shows this subspecies to of broadly very similar size to the nominate race. In males, the wing chord is and, in females, the wing chord is . The mean wing chord lengths were reportedly in males and , which indicates a slightly less pronounced sexual dimorphism than in the nominate race. As for body mass, 1 male was found to weigh while three females weighed from .
*&quot;A. r. vindhiana&quot;; excluding the Arabian Peninsula, this race likely comprises all the tawny eagles found in Asia, such as in southeastern Iran and the Indian subcontinent. However, ambiguities exists on where the range of &quot;A. r. belisarius&quot; ends and of &quot;vindhiana&quot; begins, especially in Middle Eastern areas. Sometimes &quot;A. r. vindhiana&quot; is suggested as full species. This subspecies averages darker than either other race and usually is lacking in warmer rufous tone. In general, it is somewhat more similar in hue to the steppe eagle. Adult irises are sometimes brown in &quot;A. r. vindhiana&quot; (again reminiscent of the steppe eagle). The pale morph of this race is greyer and less rufous than African tawny eagles, although generally juveniles and immature are sometimes more rufous. It may be marginally the smallest subspecies, although in general the tawny eagle evinces remarkably little size variation across its wide range. Wing chord measurements are in males and . In males, the wing chord reportedly averages about and in females, it averages . In males the tail length is and in female it is . The tarsus length of male &quot;A. r. vindhiana&quot; is and in females is . Unsexed adults in India weighed from .

==Description==
The tawny eagle is considered to appear &quot;inelegant, scruffy-looking&quot; but has a fairly characteristic aquiline silhouette. The species has a fairly long neck and long deep bill with a gape line level with the eye, moderately long wings with fairly pronounced &quot;fingers&quot; and a slightly rounded to almost square-ended and shortish tail, which can be more reminiscent of the tail of a vulture than that of other eagles. The feathering on the legs is extensive and can appear almost baggy-looking. The bill and head are strong and bold, the body well-proportioned and feet are powerful while the countenance is quite fierce-looking. While perching, the tawny eagle tends to sit rather upright, often on stumps, posts, low trees or treetops for long periods of the day or may descend to the ground to walk somewhat unsteadily with a more horizontal posture. The wingtips when perched are roughly even with the tip of the tail. Adults have variably colored eyes, ranging from yellow to pale brown to yellow brown, while those of juveniles are dark brown. Both the cere and feet are yellow at all ages. The tawny eagle is polymorphic with considerable individual variation in plumage, resulting in occasional disparities in plumages that can engender confusion in some. In adulthood, they can vary in coloration from all dark grey-brown to an occasionally streaky (or more plain) foxy-rufous to buffish-yellow. Most adults are usually a general grey-brown or rufous-tawny color, with occasional pale spotting visible at close quarters on the nape and belly, coverts uniformly toned as the body. The nape is consistently dark and uniform despite the feathers often being tipped paler with other feathers in adults, lacking the contrasting paler feathers often seen in other &quot;Aquila&quot;. Females, in addition to being slightly larger, may tend to be slightly darker and more streaked than the males. The most blackish-brown individuals tend to occur in India. Adults often show relatively little varying colors apart from their somewhat blacker wing and tail feathers, though when freshly molted great wing coverts and secondaries may show small pale tips which may form pale lines along closed wing has tawny upper parts and blackish flight feathers and tail. The head is often similarly tawny in colour as the body but may also sometimes shows darker eyebrows, other thin brown streaks or a darker chin. Meanwhile, the tail is plain or obscurely dark barred (with around 7 subtle bands). The dark morph adult is essentially all dark, dull brown. Some dark morph tawny eagles with wear may show irregular streaking or molting browns and more blackish feathers. Intermediate morph are dark to rufous brown above with the mantle and wing coverts variably streaked or molted lighter rufous as is the head with the crown or crown-sides being paler. The intermediate morph&#x27;s underside is largely rufous (especially farther south in Africa) with breast and flanks very heavily and broadly streaked dark brown, though at times appears all dark brown contrasting with plain trousers and crissum. Pale morph adult tawny eagles always show a clear contrast between the pale body and wing coverts which bear darker flight feathers and tail. In pale morphs, the underparts are rufous buff to lighty tawny-brown, phasing into somewhat darker lesser and median wing coverts to darker brown to even blackish greater coverts and flight feathers. The head may too be tawny in pale morph tawny eagles but sometimes with thin brown streaks or darker chin. Below pale morph adults are all light rufous to tawny buff or brown, sometimes paler below the belly area. In worn individuals the bodily feathers of pale morph tawny eagles can appear almost whitish. Dark morph juvenile tawny eagles are generally light rufous to rufous brown with creamier lower back to upper tail coverts. Juveniles show thinly pale-tipped dark brown greater coverts and remiges while the tail is barred grey and brown usually with a narrow creamy tip. Dark morph juveniles may fade to pale buff or creamy often before molting into browner plumage. Subsequent stages are not as well-known but it appears dark morph subadults gradually manifest a darker brown or rufous brown color on the mantle, as well as on the head and upper breast while maintaining a buffish rear body (i.e. lower back and rump patch). Generally other morphs are similar but not as well-known and are perhaps individually inconsistent. Many are rufous or sandy after a molt but have mottling later on, the extent of pale feathers indicative perhaps of their ultimate adult morph.

In flight, the tawny eagle appears as a large raptor with a noticeably protruding head on a long neck, with a deep chest, long and broad wings with a somewhat narrower seven-fingered hand. The trailing edge of the wing is slightly curved outwards, indenting at the junction of primaries and secondaries, whilst the rounded, medium-length tail is usually held spread. The deep beats of the kinked wings can make their flight appear rather heavy and slow but they are quicker and more expansive in wing movements and often less forceful-looking than larger &quot;Aquila&quot; like steppe eagles and can be very agile when chasing other raptors to rob them. Tawny eagles soar with flat wings or very slightly raised and hands only slightly lower, and may fly similarly in a glide but may too arch when in a fast glide. Adult dark morphs are more or less uniform dark brown above and below, showing indistinctly and slightly paler and greyish primaries on both sides. Above, the main contrast on dark morphs above is paler creamy rump patch while, on the underside, the greyish color is contrasted with blackish tips and a diffused trailing edge along both the wings and tail. Intermediate morph tawny eagles are variably rufous streaked on brown to rufous brown on the back and wing coverts with a similar contrasting pale rump above as dark morphs. Below the intermediate&#x27;s heavy dark streaks are only subtly different and their coloring can appear almost uniform. The wing quills of intermediate morphs are often greyer with a stronger contrast of the paler inner primaries and blackish wing ends. Pale morph are all pale tawny or buffish on both sides of the wing, which contrasting strongly with demarcated dark brown about the greater coverts, flight feathers and tail and usually the scapulars. The primaries are quite pale on pale morphs with sometimes the hint of a pale carpal comma. Some pale adults have pale bases to all the underprimaries and the quills are sometimes unbarred, but more usually the feathers have dense but narrow dark bars. Dark morph juveniles are light rufous to pale tawny body above which contrasts strongly with dark brown greater coverts, rear scapulars, flight feathers and tail, in turn all highlighting the creamy lower back to tail coverts. Below dark morph juveniles can look similar to pale morph adults apart from trailing whitish edges and often irregular pale diagonals along tips of greater wing coverts, though usually these fade early on. Little is known plumage development but the young eagles moult into brown, becoming patchy with intermediate often showing 1-3 darker bars on wing linings. The underparts of subadults (i.e. around 2 to 3 years or old) are typically two-toned, with darker brown about the breasts, belly and underwings coverts while the remainder of the underbody is creamy light in colour. This two-toned pattern is evinced in subadult tawny eagles both from India and Africa. Adult plumage is obtained between the 4th and 5th years of life.

===Size===

This is a large bird of prey, though is medium-sized for an eagle and it is one of the smaller species in the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;. Among currently accepted species in the genus, it is of quite similar size to Bonelli&#x27;s eagles (&quot;Aquila fasciata&quot;) (though is notably longer winged), slightly larger than African hawk-eagles (&quot;Aquila spilogaster&quot;) and much larger than Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagles (&quot;Aquila africanus&quot;). Otherwise, females of the larger species of &quot;Aquila&quot; are frequently around twice as heavy as an average tawny eagle. As is typical in birds of prey, the female tawny eagle is larger than the male, though relatively modestly so and a difference between the sexes is typically up to 15%. In total length, tawny eagles can measure from . A typical length for a tawny eagle is considered about . Wingspans can measure from . Weight can range in fully grown birds from . Average weights were reported in one study as in 5 males and in 5 females. In another study, 10 unsexed adult tawny eagles were found to have weighed on average while, for the same data pool, a sample of 15 had an average wingspan of . Another small sample of African males, sample size four, averaged while three females averaged . The mean mass of the species in one estimate was . In all standard measurements combined, the wing chord can vary from , the tail from and the tarsus from . The culmen length of Kenyan tawny eagles was measured at , averaging , while the gape width is on average, ranging from . The hallux-claw, the enlarged rear talon often used as a killing instrument on accipitrids, can measure from , averaging in one sample and in another. The talon size is not especially large for a booted eagle and is proportionately similar in size to those of steppe eagles and eastern imperial eagles (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;).

===Confusion species===

The tawny eagle lives in multiple areas where other broadly similar brownish hued and largish raptors often occur. Thus identification is seldom straightforward.

One source that can especially engender potential confusion in its wintering range is the formerly conspecific steppe eagle. The steppe is larger with a shorter neck, relatively longer and narrower wings, a more massive beak, particularly via the exceptional depth of the gape (although in flight can appear smaller headed due its less protruding neck) and has a longer and rounder tail. Furthermore, steppe eagles tends to have much bolder and widely spaced barring on the wings than tawny eagles and more distinct dark trailing wing edges and paler throats.

Beyond steppe eagles, comparisons to various other groups of sympatric booted eagles may be made. Compared to the spotted eagles, the tawny eagle&#x27;s tail is longer, the bill more prominent, the wings usually less squared-off in flight, the neck longer and the overall look rangier, despite these species being of often similar size. In contrast to the imperial eagles, the wings of the tawny eagle are broader and have less even trailing edges, the bill is slightly less prominent, and the wings are more likely to be held slightly upwards, while the body size is smaller. When compared to the golden eagle species complex, of which only the golden and the Verreaux&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila verreauxii&quot;) are usually relevant (although three dissimilar and sympatric pale-bellied eagles, of a size with tawny eagles or smaller, are found as part of this evolutionary chain), the tawny eagle is considerably smaller, its wings do not taper as much nor are they as likely to be held in a strong dihedral, and proportionately, the bill is notably longer and the tail is rather shorter. Greater spotted eagles (&quot;Clanga clanga&quot;), like the steppe eagle a Palearctic breeding eagle who often winters in the resident range of tawny eagles, is fairly similar, but that species has a relatively shorter and broader tail, less baggy feathers on the legs and usually a rather darker and more uniform adult plumage. The &quot;fulvescens&quot; form of the greater spotted eagle must be distinguished from the pale forms of the tawny eagle by its underwing pattern, often with completely blackish underwing coverts and usually plain looking dark remiges over the entire primaries with more distinct pale carpal arcs. The likewise migratory lesser spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga pomarina&quot;) is smaller than the tawny eagle and more compact with a distinct white U above the tail. The residential African Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Hieraeetus wahlbergi&quot;) can have a similar uniform plumage as in tawny eagles but always has greyer flight feathers and is much smaller than tawny eagles with relatively longer and more rectangular wings and a longer, narrower and straighter-tipped tail. The eastern imperial eagle in juvenile plumage can appear similar to the pale and intermediate morph tawny eagles, but the imperial eagle is usually visibly larger, with slenderer, longer wings, a longer, broader tail as well as having dark brown streaking on the chest, mantle and wing coverts and bearing more distinct pale trailing edges and wing bars.

Dark-morph tawny eagles in India may be distinguished from similarly sized black eagles (&quot;Ictinaetus malaiensis&quot;) by the latter being slenderer and having longer, darker and more paddle-shaped wings with a narrower base and a much longer, narrower and distinctly barred tail. More dissimilar eagles such as Circaetinae, i.e. brown snake eagles (&quot;Circaetus cinereus&quot;), black-breasted snake eagles (&quot;Circaetus pectoralis&quot;) and juvenile bateleurs (&quot;Terathopius ecaudatus&quot;), are sometimes mentioned as a potential source of confusion but are usually rather distinct (all larger headed, rather smaller billed, shorter tailed and bare legged with often less uniform coloring) even in their most similar hues.

===Calls===
Tawny eagles are generally silent in most of their range. However, unlike steppe eagles, which are almost always silent away from their breeding grounds, they are said to occasionally vocalize in any season. They are also more vocal when not breeding than the spotted eagles. The usual call is a harsh, hollow-sounding, loud bark, variously transcribed as &quot;kowk-kowk&quot;, &quot;kau-kau&quot;, &quot;kiok-kiok&quot; or &quot;ki-ark&quot;. The call is fairly high-pitched (slightly less deep than the steppe eagle&#x27;s when the latter is breeding) but is still deeper voiced than spotted eagles. In Kruger National Park it is said the call is loud and far-travelling. Male tawny eagles are the most frequent vocalizers in the species, particularly during sky-dances, but also in other contexts. These include but are not limited to food arguments, disturbances during nesting and males attracting females for food passes. In nine years of monitoring tawny eagles in Zimbabwe, however, the call was not heard once. Its silence there may be due to the flat landscape. Other call recorded include a harsh grating &quot;k eke ke&quot;... in aerial courtship displays and a throaty &quot;kra&quot; in kleptoparastic pursuits. A &quot;kra-kra&quot; call may emitted at times to warn intruders. The female may also emit an occasional mewing, high &quot;shreep-shreep&quot; at the nest as well as a rare raucous scream (possible food-begging and alarm calls, respectively). The young chick tawny eagle chips initially but once its feathers emerge, it tends to beg with a loud call, i.e. &quot;we-yik, wee-yik&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Tawny eagles have an extremely extensive natural distribution. The African population can be found in three, fairly discrete populations. One of these is found in North Africa in south-central Morocco, possibly northern Algeria, southwestern Mauritania, Senegambia, southern Mali, central and southern Niger eastward through southern Chad, northern and central Sudan to most of Ethiopia and Somalia (but for the northeast and central-east). The north African population is scarce. In Morocco, they are heavily depleted with a few populations left in some regions such as Tarfaya, Tan-Tan and Souss-Massa. They are likely extirpated from Tunisia, where they were once frequent. In West Africa, some tawny eagles occur in Gambia, Togo, Nigeria and (though possibly not breeding) in Ivory Coast and Ghana. In east Africa and central Africa, the tawny eagle is found in central and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and throughout the drier portions of Uganda and in the entire nations of Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia (quite often residing in the Luangwa valley and the Chambeshi drainage), Malawi and Mozambique. In east Africa, it is considered perhaps the most widely distributed and regularly sighted brown eagle. In southern Africa, the tawny eagle is found throughout Zimbabwe (now often rare apart from Matabeleland and Chipinga Uplands), Botswana (still regular in Okavango Delta) and some areas of Namibia, southern and western Angola (Cuando Cubango, Cunene, Huíla Namibe, to Malanje), Eswatini, Lesotho and northern and central parts of South Africa, i.e. mainly north of the Orange River but sometimes down to the Cape Province. The tawny eagle may be extinct as a breeder in Eswatini where it was last confirmed to have bred in 2001.

Out of Africa, the species may possibly be found in the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula, i.e. in Yemen and extreme southwestern Saudi Arabia in the Tihamah and &#x27;Asir Regions, but few to none confirmed breeding events have been reported in the last few decades. The tawny eagle is considered a rare vagrant in Israel, though some are verified, other reports of them often turn out to be misidentified steppe eagles. They are also known as a rare vagrant in Oman. In Asia, the tawny eagle exists in isolation in southeastern Iran (as in Arabia, verified recent breeding is not known) and somewhat more continuously in eastern Pakistan (often in the Indus valley), much of north and peninsular India, eastward scarcely through southern Nepal and Assam. Though Nepali tawny eagles are rarely recorded, it is thought that the species still resides there in lowland semi-deserts. The Indian range is from Punjab through the Indo-Gangetic Plain and western Bengal, northeastern Bihar, the Deccan Plateau with range continuing down to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and (mainly north-central) Tamil Nadu. Records of vagrating tawny eagles turning up in Myanmar, northern Vietnam and Thailand are thought to have been likely misidentified steppe eagles or are based on now unidentifiable specimens. A small handful of vagrants have been verified to turn up in Sri Lanka (the only known appearance by an &quot;Aquila&quot; eagle there). Old reports of vagrancy, probably in need of confirmation, are known also from Afghanistan.

===Habitat===

Tawny eagles occurs in fairly open country at varied elevations but usually live in drier areas. In West Africa, the species breeds often in relatively moist forest-savanna mosaics but can move into dry woodlands and semi-deserts when not breeding. In Morocco, the species prefers forested areas near mountains with adjacent plains. Elsewhere in Africa, tawny eagles typically inhabit wooded savanna such as dry &quot;Acacia&quot; savanna and semi-desert to desert areas. However, extreme desert areas, completely lacking in arborescent growth, are avoided nearly as much so as humid tropical rainforests. It also occurs at times in manmade areas such as arable lands, roadsides, dams, farmland, cattle pastures and game areas if feeding opportunities occur in them. In southern Africa, thornveld is often the preferred habitat with the tawny eagles mostly preferring stands of &quot;Acacia&quot;. Despite similar climates, within the miombo woodland, the tawny eagle tends to be more scarce. In India, similar habitats may largely be used but the tawny eagle may fairly often occur too in the vicinity of villages and cultivations and frequents garbage dumps and slaughterhouses somewhat more so than they do in Africa. In addition to all gradients of arid zones, in India, the tawny eagle frequently is found around thorn forests. Tawny eagles may live from sea level to about but tends to prefer somewhat lower elevations. Despite a certain level of aridity expected in tawny eagle habitats, they normally will not nest unless a habitat meets certain demands. The tawny eagle&#x27;s presence is predicated on the availability of ephemeral rainfall during the wet season. This reliance on some rainfall is probably key to habitat quality and resulting prey populations to some extent, but also to the availability of nesting sites. The tawny eagle is by and large an obligate tree nester and so areas that become too arid to support tree growth or where trees are overharvested are unlikely to retain the species.

==Behaviour==

The tawny eagle, quite unlike the steppe eagle, is largely sedentary and non-migratory. However, in Africa it is at times considered to be fairly nomadic and can engage in some seasonal movements. In west Africa, &quot;A. r. belisarius&quot; rather regularly travels shorter distance to damp woodlands during October through November, returning north in April, and perhaps at least at times, migrates into Kalahari region of Botswana and may vagrate to southern South Africa. Sometimes, tawny eagles seem to ping semi-regularly between Ethiopia and west Africa. Some long distance wandering has even been reported, such as a vagrant &quot;A. r. belisarius&quot; in Tunisia and as far as Egypt (where twice recorded in the 1950s) and even Israel (3 winter records in the 1990s) and Oman. From the Indian range, individuals vagrate not infrequently to nearby Bangladesh, most likely as juveniles post-dispersal wanderings, but reports of the species wandering into southeast Asia such as Thailand are now considered likely apocryphal. Generally, in areas such as southern Africa, tawny eagles usually seldom seem to leave their established breeding territories and juvenile eagles generally wander no more than several dozen kilometres from their original nest. A bird banded as a nestling in Esigodini was recovered quite nearby at Fort Rixon more than two years later. However, in a rather far dispersal for southern Africa, one eagle banded as a nestling was recovered away from its nest of origin in Zimbabwe four years later. Inconsistent and seemingly unpredictable movements by tawny eagles have been proven via experimental ecological studies to be actually be instances of eagles searching out new areas to compensate for lack of rainfall. While non-breeding steppe eagles are often slightly social and flock at opportunistic feeding sources, the tawny eagle is usually considered solitary. However, groups of two to three tawny eagles are sometimes seen, such as in the Indian subcontinent, but occasionally group sizes may even exceed this figure. In the Mirpur Division of Azad Kashmir in Pakistan, small flocks of tawny eagles have reportedly been witnessed gathering in warmer spots between November and February, over three years of study. Small groups or aggregations are known to occur in Africa as well near concentrated foods and even communal roost have been reported in trees, power pylons or on the ground. Like many large raptors, the tawny eagle probably spends the majority of its day perched but take wing a few times a day. Unlike most large eagles, in India at least, tawny eagles are often fairly accustomed to humans and may allow fairly close approach by observers.

==Feeding==

The tawny eagle is unique as an &quot;Aquila&quot; eagle in the lack of apparent specialization in its feeding behaviour. While most other &quot;Aquila&quot; will opportunistically scavenge, the tawny eagle freely takes to scavenging on carrion, perhaps doing so at all times of the year, though do so somewhat more so when not breeding. Routine scavenging often drives tawny eagles to refuse dumps in or near villages and slaughterhouses, particularly in India, and to associate quite often with vultures at carrion sites. They are also frequently recorded on roadsides where roadkill provides a steady food source. More routinely than almost any other raptor, perhaps, it is a very skilled pirate, regularly engaging in kleptoparasitism of other birds of prey. However, descriptions of the tawny eagle as &quot;sluggish&quot;, &quot;not very distinguished&quot; and &quot;unimpressive&quot; are not particularly apt as the tawny eagle is a highly rapacious predator that attacks very variable ranges of live prey including particularly large prey. This species hunts mainly by a short dive or pounce from a perch or by stoop from up high in a soaring flight. In the Indian subcontinent, preferred hunting perch trees were &quot;Vachellia nilotica&quot;, &quot;Prosopis cineraria&quot; and &quot;Capparis decidua&quot;. It may also often forage by walking on the ground. Mostly, tawny eagles target live prey that is on the ground, seldom targeting arboreal prey. However, they will sometimes fly down and take birds on the wing. Avian prey known to be killed in the air has ranged from speckled pigeons (&quot;Columba guinea&quot;) to flamingoes. Tawny eagles may hunt frequently in pairs during the breeding season, often securing larger prey than in the non-breeding season. Sometimes this tandem hunting by pairs can occur in any season. It is likely that tandem hunting by pairs involves one bird engaging in conspicuous flight to distract the quarry while another flies inconspicuously to sneak up on and kill the prey, as has been reported in other tandem hunting raptors. Nocturnal animals such as genets and springhares have been preyed upon by tawny eagles in areas where there was no possibility they were killed by traffic at night. In addition to other observations have been made where tawny eagles drink and bathe at night, some nocturnal subsistence behaviour by this species has been inferred but no irrefutable evidence has been brought forth either. Semi-regular attendance at grassfires in India, presumably in order to capture displaced creatures, has been reported. More than 200 species, including both live prey and carrion, are known to be eaten by tawny eagles and they may have one of the most variable diet of all tropical eagles. Reportedly, most prey the tawny eagle will take alive will weigh not less than and not more than , however live prey has been revealed to be regularly more variable than even that estimate represents. One compilation study showed that, compared to 8 other &quot;Aquila&quot; and spotted eagles, the tawny eagle&#x27;s diet was the most evenly spread across all weight classes of prey from under to over , though took prey in the latter prey class slightly less so than the much larger golden and wedge-tailed eagles (&quot;Aquila audax&quot;). This study further determine that the most often focused on weight class in tawny eagle&#x27;s diets were and prey class, accounting for a little less than half of the prey by quantity. According to this authority, the mean prey size falls around approximately , which is around 5 times greater than the mean estimated prey size for the steppe eagle species, around 38% greater than mean estimated prey size of imperial eagles and considerably less only than the golden, wedge-tailed and Verreaux&#x27;s eagles among the 8 studied &quot;Aquila&quot; and &quot;Clanga&quot; species.

===Probable live prey===

Determining whether prey has been taken alive at the nests of tawny eagles is generally considered to be difficult, although observations suggest that during breeding tawny eagles usually deliver fresh prey while raising young, indicating that such prey are usually either taken alive or newly pirated from other predators. Within a Kenyan study, only 1.9% of prey brought to tawny eagle nests was thought likely to be from carrion. While hunting prey, it often takes a variety of prey usually focusing somewhat on small to medium-sized mammals, usually medium-sized to large birds and occasionally medium to large-sized reptiles. A diet analysis in Zimbabwe indicated that among 160 prey items, 36.9% were mammals, 51.9% were birds, 10% were reptiles and 1.2% were amphibians. The leading prey species here were scrub hare (&quot;Lepus saxatilis&quot;), at about 15.6% of the total, helmeted guineafowl (&quot;Numida meleagris&quot;), at about 11.9% of the prey total, both chickens and unidentified snakes at around 6.9% and indeterminate spurfowl and doves at 6.2% and 5%, respectively. A similar dietary study conducted in Lochinvar National Park, Zambia found a higher proportion of birds and amphibians (61.4% &amp; 5.5% respectively), with a surprisingly number of water birds being taken. Of 127 prey items here, the main prey species were determined to be helmeted guineafowl at about 15% of the diet, Swainson&#x27;s spurfowl (&quot;Pternistis swainsonii&quot;) at 11%, poultry at about 8.7%, the African openbill (&quot;Anastomus lamelligerus&quot;) at 7.9% with the top mammals in the diet being scrub hares, at 5.5%, and African marsh rats (&quot;Dasymys incomtus&quot;) at 3.9%; furthermore indeterminate snakes comprised 5.5% of the diet. The variation in diet between the preceding two study sites is due to differences in habitat and prey availability. A very detailed study was conducted in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya, of the diet of the local tawny eagles over different years. Of 543 total prey items, 41.2% were mammals, 35.4% were birds, and 23.4% were reptiles and amphibians. Of these the most important prey was Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik (&quot;Madoqua kirkii&quot;) at 21.7% of the total, yellow-necked spurfowl (&quot;Pternistis leucoscepus&quot;) at 6.8% of the total, cape hare (&quot;Lepus capensis&quot;) and crested francolin (&quot;Dendroperdix sephaena&quot;) both at 6.3% and red-crested korhaan (&quot;Lophotis ruficrista&quot;) at 5.9%; additionally, unidentified snakes constituted 21.3% of the foods. The dik-dik is a small antelope and is much larger than a tawny eagle. The tawny eagle certainly took dik-diks weighing up to and possibly even , with this eagle taking about 80 dik-diks in Tsavo East each year. In different areas of South Africa, small dietary studies determined the diet at nests to be highly variable. In the Highveld, about 52% of 60 prey items were mammals, 45% were birds and a small number were fish. In Timbavati and Klaserie, 63% of the diet was birds, 34% of it was mammals and 3% were reptiles. At Highveld, 25% of the diet consisted of yellow mongoose (&quot;Cynictis penicillata&quot;), 15% Cape ground squirrels (&quot;Xerus inauris&quot;) and 13% helmeted guineafowl. At Timbavati and Klaserie, various francolins were strongly predominant in foods, at about 44% with another 17% by various mongooses.

Out of the southern and eastern areas of Africa, less quantitative analysis has been undertaken into the feeding habits of tawny eagles, even around nests. What is known of their prey elsewhere is mainly from wide-ranging surveys, secondary accounts and photographs. It appears in Ethiopia that the tawny eagle may have a close predatory relationship with the Abyssinian grass rat (&quot;Arvicanthis abyssinicus&quot;) while one tawny eagle there tore open the nest of the Stresemann&#x27;s bushcrow (&quot;Zavattariornis stresemanni&quot;) to access the prey. Unidentified large rats constituted a great majority of prey delivered during the nestling growth stage at some east African nests. Fewer details are known about the prey of tawny eagles in the Indian subcontinent. One study, without quantitative data known, listed the prey of tawny eagles in Saurashtra as Indian palm squirrels (&quot;Funambulus palmarum&quot;), eggs of red-wattled lapwings (&quot;Vanellus indicus&quot;), crows, mongooses, Indian hares (&quot;Lepus nigricollis&quot;) and even Bengal fox (&quot;Vulpes bengalensis&quot;). Otherwise, the prey incidentally reported in India is extremely varied, including even the hindlegs of a jungle cat (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;) (but this may have been scavenged). In general, tawny eagles in south Asia may focus on less varying prey in general, often reportedly favoring desert-dwelling rodents and hares. Tawny eagles may hunt a couple dozen species of rodent from different parts of the range, ranging in size from the Natal multimammate mouse (&quot;Mastomys natalensis&quot;) to the South African springhare (&quot;Pedestes capensis&quot;). Rock hyrax (&quot;Procavia capensis&quot;) and yellow-spotted rock hyrax (&quot;Heterohyrax brucei&quot;) are occasionally preyed upon by tawny eagles. The tawny eagle may be one of the most accomplished predators of mongoose, many food studies reflecting relatively high numbers of them and they appear to be one of the most feared predators at meerkat (&quot;Suricata suricatta&quot;) colonies. In the Karoo, the local tawny eagles reportedly live mostly off of mongooses, either meerkats or yellow mongooses. Similarly small or slightly larger carnivores like striped polecats (&quot;Ictonyx striatus&quot;) and genets are not infrequently prey for tawny eagles as well. Bat-eared foxes (&quot;Otocyon megalotis&quot;) may too be taken alive at times. Various monkeys may be eaten, although not infrequently as carrion, tawny eagles may too in seldom cases attack juveniles of monkeys such as Patas monkeys (&quot;Erythrocebus patas&quot;), grivets (&quot;Chlorocebus aethiops&quot;) and vervet monkeys (&quot;Chlorocebus pygerythrus&quot;) up to the size of juveniles of several species of baboon. However, unlike with larger eagles, the troops of certain baboons do not seem to regard tawny eagles as a threat based on their behavioural responses. While most ungulate prey other than dik-diks is probably largely scavenged as carrion or stolen from other predators, the small calves of ungulates such as Thomson&#x27;s gazelle (&quot;Eudorcas thomsonii&quot;) are sometimes apparently killed by tawny eagles. A general picture appears to emerge that tawny eagles quite often takes relatively large mammalian prey, surprisingly often creatures weighing up to such as hares, dik-diks, the young of other antelopes, hyraxes and so on.

While mammals prey varies from rodents to hares, mongooses and small antelopes, the diversity and size range of bird taken may be even more impressive and more than 120 avian prey species have been reported in the prey spectrum. Included in the prey spectrum are various species of ducks and small or gosling geese, gamebirds, especially francolins and guineafowl, many doves and pigeons, mostly medium-sized species of bustard and hornbill and numerous water birds from small coursers, lapwings, rails and grebes to large flamingoes, storks and herons both small and large. Both young and adult Old World flamingoes of both African species are known to be attacked on occasion, as well as white-breasted cormorants (&quot;Phalacrocorax lucidus&quot;) and great cormorants (&quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot;), all birds similar in size or somewhat heavier than the tawny eagle itself. Further impressive water bird prey includes reportedly spur-winged goose (&quot;Plectropterus gambensis&quot;), which weighs about twice as much as tawny eagle. Even larger avian prey are taken including a common crane (&quot;Grus grus&quot;) killed by a pair in Saurashtra (although it was an injured one) and presumably adult female Kori bustard (&quot;Ardeotis kori&quot;). If average-sized, these prey items likely weighed more than . More minor avian prey includes nightjars, coucals, sandgrouse, swifts, bee-eaters, kingfishers, rollers, wood hoopoes, turacos, parrots and several passerines. One small passerine the tawny eagle may routinely hunt is the super-abundant red-billed quelea (&quot;Quelea quelea&quot;). Near poultry farms, tawny eagles can take to not infrequently lifting free-range chickens (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) and other poultry, especially when the eagles must feed their young, thus in turn potentially drawing ire of local farmers.

Various snakes are taken opportunistically by tawny eagles and they can be quite bold about hunting venomous snakes. In southern Africa and Kenya the following snakes have been identified in the foods of tawny eagles: Egyptian sand boa (&quot;Eryx colubrinus&quot;), young African rock python (&quot;Python sebae&quot;), speckled sand racer (&quot;Psammophis punctulatus&quot;), rufous beaked snake (&quot;Rhamphiophis oxyrhynchus&quot;), black-necked spitting cobra (&quot;Naja nigricollis&quot;), black mamba (&quot;Dendroaspis polylepis&quot;), boomslang (&quot;Dispholidus typus&quot;) and puff adder (&quot;Bitis arietans&quot;). They also hunt lizards not infrequently given the chance, usually favoring fairly large species but capable of taking those ranging from geckos to rock monitors (&quot;Varanus albigularis&quot;). At one nest in Zimbabwe, monitor lizards made up 29% of 83 prey items, but they were only 8% of 107 prey items of 3 other nests in the same park. One of the most frequently seen prey to be taken by tawny eagles in India have been Indian spiny-tailed lizard (&quot;Saara hardwickii&quot;). More minor prey have included turtles, frogs and toads and fish. A tawny eagle in southern Africa was seen to wade into shallow water and successfully pull out a largish catfish. Tawny eagles can also take communal nesting and swarming insects fairly frequently. These are generally termites, which can attract several of these eagles especially amongst non-breeding eagles and young ones. When visiting termites, the tawny eagles commonly eat alates and may, with an unusual lack of aggression, share the food source with several other birds of prey, including as many as a half dozen conspecifics. At times, tawny eagles can also be attracted to swarms of grasshoppers. In one case, a tawny eagle was seen consuming the fruit of an &quot;Adansonia&quot; tree, an unusual instance of frugivory which is very rare in accipitrids other than one unusual species: the palm-nut vulture (&quot;Gypohierax angolensis&quot;). A tawny eagle was once witnessed picking through elephant dung along with a vulture, presumably searching for dung beetles to consume.

===Carrion===

Although the tawny eagle does hunt for food, it also relies extensively on carrion as a food source. Although most booted eagles and &quot;Aquila&quot; will opportunistically feed on carrion, none is known to do so as routinely as the tawny eagle. They have been recorded feeding on a huge array of carcasses as large as African bush elephants (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;) and at least as small as vervet monkeys and perhaps even down to the size of a dove. Perhaps most frequently in Africa, tawny eagles will feed at carcasses of ungulates such as antelope. At least 30-40 different species of ungulate have been recorded as carrion food-sources for these eagles. At &quot;vulture restaurants&quot; in Ethiopia, feeding stations with dead livestock meant to mitigate the rapid decline in population of most African vultures, the tawny eagle was the second most often recorded scavenger at just under 35% of 1088 of recorded birds to feed at them. The tawny eagle shares its carrion food sources almost invariably with vultures and usually with several other scavengers such as jackals and hyenas. Other birds that frequently also attend carrion are bateleurs, many other eagles (including steppe eagles) and marabou storks (&quot;Leptoptilos crumenifer&quot;). The producer-scrounger theory predicts that vultures rely on eagles for information on carcasses. Due to their smaller size, eagles, i.e. tawny eagles and bateleurs, are able to begin foraging earlier in the morning and are thus more likely to locate a carcass first. In 91 observed carcass in southern Africa, tawny eagles were verified to be the first to find 5 of them. Furthermore, vultures usually arrived in less than 40 minutes (in 75% of cases) after the tawny eagles found the carcass. At large carcasses, there is a hierarchical social structure based on the size of the scavenger. At Maasai Mara, the top scavengers were the considerably to slightly heavier mammals, i.e. spotted hyenas (&quot;Crocuta croctua&quot;), black-backed jackals (&quot;Canis mesomelas&quot;) and feral dogs (&quot;Canis lupus familiaris&quot;), then the lappet-faced vulture (&quot;Torgos tracheliotos&quot;), the Rüppell&#x27;s griffon (&quot;Gyps rueppellii&quot;), followed by all other vultures with the tawny eagle and the bateleur in the second most and the most subordinate scavenger positions. Similar scavenger hierarchies have been reported elsewhere as well. Bateleurs were the most likely to first find a carcass of the Maasai Mara scavengers and both the tawny and bateleur were considered as scavengers with &quot;low competitive ability and high search efficiency&quot;.

However, tawny eagles will at times be able to displace the smaller species of vulture such as hooded vultures (&quot;Necrosyrtes monachus&quot;) and Egyptian vultures (&quot;Neophron percnopterus&quot;), both of which are similar in weight to the tawny eagles themselves, with one tawny eagle even reportedly keeping as many as 20 vultures at bay at a carcass. In general, based on the literature, such an event of aggressiveness by this species at a large carcass would surely be unusual. Tawny eagles do tend to be dominant over bateleur at carcasses, however. &quot;Gyps&quot; or griffon vultures are usually the most numerous vultures in attendance at carrion and are considerably larger than tawny eagles but sometimes may briefly tolerate a tawny eagle to feed in their midst depending on the circumstances. Usually, the larger the group is of griffon vultures, the less likely the tawny eagle is to get to feed. The eagles not infrequently remain on the periphery of the vulture feeding frenzy and wait for pieces of flesh to appear. Often they will be able to pick up small scraps but will wait until the carcass is finished and few vultures remain to feed. The tawny eagle can benefit from leading other scavengers to carrion or feeding subsequently to them since, unlike the largest and most aggressive vultures, such as lappet-faced vultures and cinereous vultures (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;), the tawny eagle cannot tear open large carcasses on their own and tend rely on another source to access any bits of the nutritious viscera. The tawny eagles when finding an unopened large carcass have few feeding options although may eat the eyes in such circumstances, as was verified in the circumstance of a tawny eagle finding a horse (&quot;Equus ferus caballus&quot;) carcass offered by researchers. Roadkills are another feeding option as they are often torn asunder by impact with automobiles and the eagle may be able to (at least briefly) monopolize the carcass. Perhaps not coincidentally, in Maasai Mara, the tawny eagles were found to benefit from a carcass being nearer human habitations and in lower quality habitats relative to the other scavengers. In particularly in India, scavenging tawny eagles tend to regularly occur at landfills where vultures seldom come but wintering steppe eagles may often feed alongside them seasonally. Garbage dumps are also visited in different parts of Africa such as Uganda and Ethiopia by hungry tawny eagles. Semi-predaceous and aggressively disposed vultures, like white-headed vultures (&quot;Trigonoceps occipitalis&quot;) in Africa and red-headed vultures (&quot;Sacrogyps calvus&quot;) in India as well as the lappet-faced and cinereous vultures, tend to have little tolerance for tawny eagles, with the latter unlikely to approach until these aggressive vultures have had their fill. On the contrary, though, at times white-headed vultures and tawny eagles have been observed peaceably sharing roadkills in some instances. Often tawny eagles will come to smaller carcasses of almost any animal, as will other smaller scavengers like bateleurs and hooded vultures as well as crows, perhaps merely to avoid the competition that often occurs at large carcasses. One subadult tawny eagle was observed to be following a pack of African wild dogs (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;), almost certainly in order to scavenge off of their kills.

===Kleptoparasitism===

The tawny eagle steals food from other raptors in addition to catching its own prey and coming to previously dead food sources. The Afrikaans name for the tawny eagle is a &quot;Roofarend&quot;, meaning the &quot;Robber Eagle&quot;. This behaviour is not entirely segregated from their scavenging on carrion behaviours but the considerable aggressiveness and boldness of the eagles in this circumstances are very different from their rather retiring disposition in scavenging contexts. At times the tawny eagle is considered &quot;fearless&quot; in their piratical attacks and is certain to engage in them more frequently than almost any other member of the booted eagle clan or perhaps even birds of prey. Other related eagles like the steppe eagle and eastern imperial eagle, as well as most sea eagles, can be locally regular kleptoparasites but tawny eagles rob prey from other birds with some regularity in every part of the range. Amongst all birds, only a few types of seabird such as skuas and frigatebirds are likely to derive a majority of their subsistence from kleptoparasitism. Generally, tawny eagles will surprise other birds of prey with a dashing stoop and yank away the prey item in a manner of seconds; they will seldom completely land if the prey item is intercepted on the ground so they can take off with the plundered item quickly. The size of birds that the tawny eagles have been known to pirate food away from have ranged from species as small as black-winged kites (&quot;Elanus caeruleus&quot;) and common kestrels (&quot;Falco tinnunculus&quot;) to those as large as a lammergeier (&quot;Gypaetus barbatus&quot;). There seems to few limits to the raptorial birds that the tawny eagle will not pirate from given the opportunity. In one case, a pair of tawny eagles descended on a secretarybird (&quot;Sagittarius serpentarius&quot;) that had killed a large puff adder and displaced both the secretarybird and an African harrier-hawk (&quot;Polyboroides typus&quot;) that had tried to enter the fray, after which the eagle pair split the adder between them. Other raptors known to be attacked for piracy in well-known and often repeated instances have included dark chanting goshawks (&quot;Melierax metabates&quot;), bateleurs, lanner falcons (&quot;Falco biarmicus&quot;) and even the imposing martial eagles (&quot;Polemaetus bellicosus&quot;) and Verreaux&#x27;s eagles, the latter eagles having appeared to offer surprisingly little to no contest the tawny eagle&#x27;s piracy despite their great strength and formidable talons. Carnivorous birds that are not traditionally considered raptorial birds, such as marabou storks and southern ground hornbills (&quot;Bucorvus leadbeateri&quot;), are also occasionally kleptoparasitized by tawny eagles. Interspecific piracy may be most frequent on bateleur despite that species being similarly sized and powered as the tawny eagle. While 5 displacements of tawny eagles by bateleur were reported in a study on their interactions, 26 instances of tawny eagles displacing bateleurs were described, clearly far more. Several smaller birds of prey were observed to be repeatedly robbed of their catches at a red-billed quelea colony, including queleas crippled but not killed by lanner falcons, although some of the maimed queleas were contested by jackals as well.

On occasion, a tawny eagle will find itself on the losing end of a kleptoparasitic interaction. Somewhat larger eagles have been seen to displace tawny eagles off of prey. These include African fish eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus vociferus&quot;), eastern imperial eagles and their cousins, steppe eagles. African fish eagles and Pallas&#x27;s fish eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucoryphus&quot;) in India both seem to take precedence over tawny eagles at shared feeding sources such as carrion sites and water bird nesting colonies. In the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia, golden eagles appear to engage in displacement of and may dominate the much smaller tawny eagles. As aforementioned, a bateleur can succeed in seldom instances in pirating tawny eagles. Vultures, especially lappet-faced vultures, may assert themselves at recent tawny eagle kills and certainly can displace the eagles in some circumstances; it is likely but not confirmed that jackals may too opportunistically rob eagles as they have been recorded doing with other eagles. Large kills, which can not infrequently include prey of up to twice the eagle&#x27;s own weight, are beyond the tawny eagle&#x27;s ability for wing loading. Such kills are probably frequently lost to other carnivores. In Ethiopia, Ethiopian wolves (&quot;Canis simensis&quot;) were seen to rob tawny eagles repeatedly of freshly-caught rodents, succeeding in 5 of 21 attempts to do so. Even much smaller birds such as house crows (&quot;Corvus splendens&quot;) have been seen to successfully rob a tawny eagle of its prey.

===Interspecific predatory relationship===

The tawny eagle occurrence in Africa and the Indian subcontinent places it in arguably two of the most competitive environments for birds of prey in the world. In turn, the tawny eagle seems to adapt via a lack of specialization on any particular prey type, hunting style or food source, and via including carrion in the diet quite often. Many other raptors and eagles overlap in habitat use with tawny eagles. However, wintering and residential &quot;Aquila&quot; and spotted eagles that bear some relation usually use slightly differing habitats in contrast to the tawny eagle. In Tsavo East National Park, the ecology of this eagle was studied at length in contrast to bateleurs and much larger martial eagles, which can appear to have broadly similar habitat and prey preferences, as well as the slightly smaller but larger-clawed African hawk eagles, which tends to habituate to slightly more wooded dry areas. In general within this study, all four eagle species derived a majority of their prey biomass from Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik but that the martial eagles tended to take slightly larger dik-diks than the bateleur and tawny eagles, took slightly more in the park per pair based on annual estimates and were more unlikely to scavenge the prey while the African hawk-eagle tends to take younger dik-diks. The diet of the tawny eagle and bateleur in Tsavo East overlapped by around 64%, whereas the diet of the tawny and martial eagles only overlapped by 29%. The tawny eagle was the only eagle here to heavily supplement their diet with alternate prey like snakes, although bateleurs also took a wide range of prey. The Tsavo East study further indicated that the predatory pressure on dik-diks is mitigated temporally by the slightly staggered nesting seasons of each eagle, with bateleurs tending to nest rather earlier, the hawk-eagle slightly later, so the peak reliance on the prey did not generally overlap. Furthermore, habitat differs, with the African hawk-eagle foraging in more wooded areas while the bateleur can forage in more open, treeless areas than tawny eagles because the bateleur is an aerial hunter while the tawny eagle typically requires perches to hunt from. Further study has indicated that, in Africa, the bateleur broadly mirrors the tawny eagle in most respects of ecology. One stark difference from virtually any other known eagle is the tawny eagle&#x27;s nesting habits. That is that this eagle nests almost invariably on the top of the canopy of a tree, rather than a main trunk or large sturdy branch of trees (or on cliffs or, in steppe eagles, the ground). The nesting location of tawny eagles runs more parallel to those of vultures. Study in Kruger National Park has shown that the tawny eagle and white-backed vulture (&quot;Gyps africanus&quot;) will freely nest in the treetop nest built by the other species. Furthermore, other species, including large owls and snake eagles, will use old nests built by tawny eagles. Although the habitats used by martial and tawny eagles have been reported as broadly similar, detailed study in the Karoo found that the tawny species preferred areas with higher and more predictable summer rainfall and with higher primary productivity than the martial.

Opportunistically, the tawny eagle may prey upon smaller birds of prey but this is fairly infrequent and the capture of raptorial birds has thus far been seldom reported. A hungry or food-gathering male tawny eagle may infrequently plunder the nests of other raptorial birds. Incautious, injured or distracted birds of prey may too be vulnerable to being killed as well. Diurnal birds of prey known to be preyed upon by tawny eagle in Africa have included black-winged kites, hooded vultures, pale chanting goshawks (&quot;Melierax canorus&quot;) and African pygmy falcons (&quot;Polihierax semitorquatus&quot;). In India, the tawny eagle has been known to prey upon western marsh harriers (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot;), shikras (&quot;Accipiter badius&quot;) and white-eyed buzzards (&quot;Butastur teesa&quot;). Owls are apparently fairly vulnerable to tawny eagle predation. Species that they have been known to prey on are barn owls (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;), spotted eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo africanus&quot;), little owls (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;), pearl-spotted owlets (&quot;Glaucidium perlatum&quot;) and marsh owls (&quot;Asio capensis&quot;). The fresh remains of a secretarybird were found in one tawny eagle nest in Africa but, if the eagles killed the bird rather than scavenged it, this would need confirmation. The tawny eagle, despite being an eagle of intermediate size, does not seem to be subject to natural predators in adulthood as far as is known and can be said to fulfill the role of an apex predator. Nestling tawny eaglets and young tawny eagles are commonly vulnerable to assorted natural predators but these are little known. A partial list of probable nest predators are likely corvids, snakes and carnivores capable of climbing. One confirmed predator of nestling tawny eagles is the honey badger (&quot;Mellivora capensis&quot;).

==Breeding biology==
===Pairing and Territories===
The tawny eagle often seems to pair for life. Like most birds of prey, they are quite territorial towards conspecifics. The commonest display is single or mutual high circling or soaring often in wide spiral. Males will sometimes dive and stoop repeatedly around the female, though she does not usually respond by turning over. Pairs may engage in the display each year to strengthen pair bonds. Occasionally two tawny eagles will interlocks talons to descend rapidly, cartwheeling down 30 m or more within a few seconds, sometimes disengaging just before the ground. In other related eagles of the Aquilinae subfamily, cartwheeling interactions are usually considered to be aggressive fights between a territorial eagle and an intruder of the same sex. Prior studies thought this to be the case for the tawny eagle, with an estimated 82% of cartwheeling instances thought to be aggressive, 11% for courtship and 7% for apparent play. However, through closer observations evidence has been made of frequent cartwheeling between males and females as a regular part of the courtship display. Undulating sky dances are sometimes performed too by males with a series of descents and upward swoops on partially close wings, accompanied by calling. However, instances of this seem to be rare. In one instance, two males appeared to engage in a display for a single female. Per one author&#x27;s opinion the aerial displays of the tawny eagle are &quot;not particularly spectacular compared to other eagles&quot;. The breeding season tends to fall in March to August in northeastern Africa, October to June in west Africa and in almost all months of the year but in central, east and southern Africa, but mainly from May to November in Kenya and April to January in central and southern Africa. In India, the breeding season is usually November to May, but occasionally can vary from any time from October to August. Mating generally occurs in and around the nest vicinity. The density very variable on the African continent overall of breeding pair which were estimated to occupy about each. Zimbabwe nest spacing was found to be in one study. On the border of Kruger National Park, 7 pairs found in a area but in regular spaced pylon nests in western Transvaal, nests were apart. In Hwange National Park, over 11 years of study, 92 pairs on were found to be nesting over basalt in a area while 84 pairs on Kalahari sands in a area. Mean nest distances on basalt were around while on sands it was around . In Zambia, the nesting density was considered high for the species at a pair per .

===Nest===
The nests of the tawny eagle are large platforms, composed of sticks but sometimes incorporating animal bones. Nesting sites tend to be open to the sky, in flat, open or hilly country, and offer a commanding, good view of the surrounding country. The sites are not infrequently close to watering holes and, more so in India, close to villages. Nests are usually above the ground, though seldom can be up to high. Nests are located at the top crown of the tree and only very rarely are placed beneath the canopy or on a lateral branch. In Kenya, tawny eagles showed no nesting preference according to tree height or spatial distribution of trees; however, they preferred &quot;Euphorbia&quot;, &quot;Boscia&quot; and &quot;Euclea&quot; tree species. In India, commonly used trees used in the northern areas are &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;, &quot;Dalbergia sissoo&quot; and mango trees while in the arid Kutch and western Rajasthan areas they often nest in rather stunted &quot;Vachellia nilotica&quot; and &quot;Prosopis chilensis&quot; (i.e. usually the nests here are high but are sometimes down to ). Trees are usually selected that have prickly branches, presumably for protection. Despite their prominent position in the trees, the nests can be surprisingly hard to perceive peering from the ground level. In Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa, tawny eagles build nests that are positioned in the canopy of large &quot;Vachellia erioloba&quot; trees. These Kgalagadi pairs tend to be the largest and tallest trees, averaging at . Tawny eagles in India reportedly often nest in a tree over successive years, but the species is threatened by the lopping and cutting of all remaining suitable trees for fuel and fodder. Tawny eagles in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, on the other hand, build new nests yearly and only 2% of nests are reused for breeding purposes the following year. Potential risk of collapse and growth of branches around the nest are thought to be factors limiting nest reuses in Africa. Usually new nests are not more than away from the prior nest. Both sexes participate in nest building and the repair of a nest takes up to 4 to 7 weeks, though most of the construction can be completed within about a week. For an eagle, their nests are relatively wide, flat and shallow. Nests may measure just under in diameter and deep but can easily reach over and with repeated uses. Nests are usually lined with grass, leaves, seedpods and fur as well as odd objects such as newspapers, paper packets and polythene bags. In Kruger National Park, tawny eagles have been recorded using nests of other species of raptor such as white-backed vulture and white-headed vulture. At times, tawny eagles have been known to nest on top of the large communal nests of the white-headed buffalo weaver (&quot;Dinemellia dinemelli&quot;). In the Central Karoo region of South Africa, tawny eagles build their nests in large electric transmission towers. Populations of large eagles like the martial eagle and Verreaux&#x27;s eagle have been recorded breeding on these power pylons since the 1970s. Between 2002 and 2003, 39% of electrical faults recorded on transmission lines were due to large eagle nests. As a result, problem nests were dismantled and rebuilt below the electrical conductors.

===Eggs===
Eggs are laid at intervals of several days, mainly timed to the dry season but at times also in the wet season. Evidence from the Kalahari Desert shows that egg-laying is timed to exploit a number of food resources with warmer weather in sync with young in the nest, such as various small mammals and the springbok (&quot;Antidorcas marsupialis&quot;) lambing season. In India, intervals were more prolonged when the habitat was less optimal. Of 26 tawny eagle nests monitored between 1988 and 1996 in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, 84.6% of the laying dates occurred between May and June. These laying dates are similar to populations in Zambia, Zimbabwe and the Maasai Mara region in Kenya as well as elsewhere in southern and southeastern Africa. Cases of eggs being laid in southern Africa in July and August may be cases of replacement clutches. Incidental data on laying phenology from north and West Africa shows the tawny eagles of the area lay eggs usually in the earlier part of the year, i.e. January to April; in Ghana egg-laying may range from October to February, though largely is in December–January; November–February egg-laying occurred in Ethiopia and apparently around April in Morocco. Showing the variation in India, in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, tawny eagles are mainly laying eggs in January while in Kutch and Jaisalmer, the young are already leaving the nests. Clutch sizes range from 1 to 3 eggs per nest, but average 1.7 eggs per clutch. In drier years in Hwange National Park, clutch sizes appear to become reduced. The eggs are white but variously and usually faintly marked with brown, varying from unmarked sometimes to quite well-marked with spots and blotches of reddish brown. In 67 eggs of the nominate subspecies, the eggs were in height by in diameter, with an average of in the sample while another 30 from the same race averaged . In &quot;A. r. vindhiana&quot;, 80 eggs measured from by , with an average of .

===Development of young and parental behaviour===
Eggs are incubated by the female for 40–44 days, with extreme records of 30 to 45 days, before hatching. Incubation tends to begin with the first egg and may be done exclusively by the female in India but, in African data, the male sometimes briefly relieves her. When the nests are climbed up to, the females are tight sitters, often flying at the very last minute. Green lining may still be added at the incubation stage. Upon hatching, the young apparently have to be constantly brooded or shaded from strong sun in the very open nests. The chicks are initially covered with white down, with a black bill, yellow cere and feet and brown eyes; a thicker white coat is acquired at 2 weeks and 1 week later the 1st feathers appear on scapulars and wing coverts. The young eaglets can stand weakly at about 3 weeks, walk around the nest at 4 weeks and start to wing-flap about a week later. Wing and tail quills sprout rapidly, with feathers appearing down the side of the breast at 4 weeks. By 5 weeks, feathers cover much of the body except for the head and underparts. By week 7, the chick has only a small amount of down feathers remaining and weighs around . The rapid development of dorsal feathers is comparable to other raptors that use open nest sites such as snake eagles and secretarybirds. Only one chick usually survives after hatching. This is often due to siblicide, where the older chick fatally wounds the younger chick in the first few days of life. The older sibling weighs around while the younger one weighs about frequently at the point of its demise or disappearance. In southern Africa, there are at least four cases of two fledglings occurring in one nest, however. At around 5 weeks, the eaglet adopts anti-predator behaviours, some laying prone while a novel animal approaches while others adopt a truculent threat posture with feathers raised, gape opened, wings poised to slap and talons barred for slashing. For the first 10 days, the adult female observes the chick very closely, relying on food provisioned by the male. After two weeks, the chick is left alone for 2.5 hours each day, whilst the adults forage. At this point the male may start making direct food deliveries to the eaglet. This is considered a relatively early point to stop attending to the nest for an eagle this size and the nest often soon becomes unsuitably foul with remains. One 39-day-old eaglet was able to tear up its own food already but was still primarily fed by the female. The first flight attempts are around 7–10 weeks but the chick is fully grown and capable of fledging the nest fully after 10–12 weeks. However, the female may remain to shelter during rainstorms around to as late as the fledging stage. The full stage of dependence is ongoing for about 6 weeks after fledging. The young tawny eagle may stay with the parents even until next breeding season. In India at least, after the nesting period, the pairs disperse and leave the nesting area, seldom being seen near the nest until pairing off again initiates in October. A juvenile tawny eagle that was shot at 2 years old was away from its original nest while 2 juveniles at 5 months and 7 months old were away, respectively.

===Nesting success and failures===
Nest losses of eggs and young appears to be quite high. Young eaglets often die, at times by their siblings, and if poorly guarded nests are often predated by a probably wide range of predators. Nesting success is driven by quality of habitats and food access. Breeding efforts in Zimbabwe produced 19 young in 26 pair years with a replacement rate of 0.73 young per pair per year. In India, tawny eagles pairs seem to adapt to suboptimal overly sandy habitats by more dispersing nests, and can show similar productivity of chicks per nest as a result. In Hwange National Park, 72.4% of pairs present were thought to breed on average in the course of a year, with an average of 0.61 fledglings produced per effort. This is and other studies support that rainfall is key to productive success in tawny eagles of this area, with far more two egg clutches rather than one egg ones (which usually failed) and less confined breeding periods in years that had greater rainfall. Breeding success, recorded as young per pair per year (ypy), was lower still in Namibia and Tsavo East National Park than in Zimbabwe (0.4, 0.5 and 0.78 ypy respectively). Higher nesting success was found in Zambia, where pair produced a mean of 1 fledgling per nest. Although an extensive study of lifespan are not known to have taken place for the tawny eagle, it is known that these eagles can live up to at least 16 years of age in the wild.
==Status==
===Conservation===
The tawny eagle still occupies a large range. In Africa, it has been estimated that the range of the species covers about 15 million square kilometers, in addition to a range of about 3.1 million square kilometers in Asia. As recently as the 1990s, the global population was thought to possibly range into six figures with a population in Asia at that time thought to be in the hundreds of thousands alone. However, the species is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN list of Threatened species. The current population is far less than half of what it was once thought to be, with only about 100,000 to just under 500,000 individuals thought to persist worldwide. There was a clear decrease in tawny eagle sightings between SABAP and SABAP2 in Southern Africa, occurring in only 323 of 1440 quarter degree grid cells. During close study of the tawny and martial eagle in central Namibia, a precipitous decline was detected in both, with a tawny eagle population that was once regionally numbered about 19 pairs down to 2 known pairs. The once seemingly innumerous population of this species within Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park was known by the 1990s to be down to merely 40 known pairs. Roadside counts conducted in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso show that although the majority of raptor species are in drastic population decline, only the tawny eagle and snake eagles are surviving outside of protected areas. In India, the tawny eagle was once considered &quot;our commonest eagle&quot; but strong declines have been detected with surveys indicating strongholds like Rajasthan have shown reductions of observed pairs by up to half. According to the producer-scrounger foraging theory, vultures are to some extent reliant on tawny eagles to help locate carcasses. Thus, the conservation of eagles outside protected areas is of vital importance to ensure the survival of vultures.

===Threats===

Tawny eagles face a number of threats that affect their breeding behaviour, foraging success and ultimately the survival of individual birds. The most recent and devastating threat to survival occurred on 20 June 2019. The carcasses of 468 white-backed vultures, 17 white-headed vultures, 28 hooded vultures, 14 lappet-faced vultures and 10 cape vultures were found alongside 2 tawny eagles. A total of 537 vultures and 2 eagles were found poisoned in northern Botswana. It is suspected that they died after eating the carcasses of 3 elephants that were laced with poison by poachers. Carcasses are poisoned to ensure that scavengers are unable to aid rangers in the effort to locate poached wildlife. By circling above dead animals, large raptors act as an early detection system for anti-poaching rangers. Poisoning events are far from restricted to Botswana and are thought to be a direct factor in the reduction of tawny eagles as well even in the protected areas of Kruger National Park. In central Namibia, all 5 of the juvenile tawny eagles that were radio-tagged were poisoned by strychnine baits, completely decimating all recruitment of the species in the area. Mysteriously, the populations of bateleurs and tawny eagles in the Maasai Mara appear to be bumping up as opposed to the declines reported elsewhere, seemingly in sync with the worsening declines of vultures on the Maasai.

Further threats to tawny eagles include habitat loss and land-use changes such as intensified cattle grazing, firewood collection and sale and the charcoal industry. Such culling of the spare trees of arid India seem to be the primary driver of less understand decline of tawny eagles in India. A seemingly higher instance of bacterial infections also seems to affecting the tawny eagles of India. Raptor populations are reliant on seasonal rainfall events which influence the survival of prey populations. Climate change is alternating rainfall patterns in the arid regions of Southern Africa and impacting on prey populations. There is a clear correlation between rainfall events and breeding success of tawny eagles. It was found that the projected decline of tawny eagles from climate change, which is already underway, begun via impact population persistence, first effecting population dynamics, the composition of biological communities and finally biodiversity. Electrocutions and collision risks associated with overhead power lines remain a constant threat to large eagles and vultures. Furthermore, the powerline nesting raptors were found to be a significant source of line faulting in the area, causing substantial financial issues. Occasionally, tawny eagles are also killed by flying into various manmade objects such as reservoirs or are killed by automobiles and are at risk at wind turbines in India. The overarching threat to any raptor population is human population increase which causes competition for habitat and food resources. Key to conservation of the tawny eagle population is mitigating the effects of global warming. Also, clearly, the banning of poison baits and the mitigation of dangerous powerlines in eagle-utilized areas is key for the survival of the tawny eagles.

<text>Austrian Nazism or Austrian National Socialism was a pan-German movement that was formed at the beginning of the 20th century. The movement took a concrete form on 15 November 1903 when the German Worker&#x27;s Party (DAP) was established in Austria with its stationed in the town of Aussig (now Ústí nad Labem in the Czech Republic). It was suppressed under the rule of Engelbert Dollfuss (1932–34), with its political organization, the DNSAP (&quot;German National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party&quot;) banned in early 1933, but was revived and made part of the German Nazi Party after the German annexation of Austria in 1938.

== Origins ==
Franko Stein from Eger (now Cheb, Czech Republic) and an apprentice bookbinder Ludwig Vogel from Brüx (now Most, Czech Republic), organised the &quot;Deutschnationaler Arbeiterbund&quot; (German National Workers&#x27; League) in 1893. It was a collection of labourers, apprentices, and trade unionists from the railroads, mines, and textile industries, who upheld nationalism as a result of their conflicts with the non-German-speaking portions of the workforce, especially in the railway systems. In 1899, Stein was able to convene a workers&#x27; congress in Eger and promulgated a 25-point program.

Another convention was called in April 1902, under the title of &quot;German-Political Workers&#x27; Association for Austria&quot; (), in Saaz. In Aussig, on 15 November 1903, they reorganized under the name of the &quot;German Workers&#x27; Party in Austria&quot; (). At further party congresses, Hans Knirsch proposed to call themselves the &quot;Nationalsozialistische&quot; (National-Socialist) or &quot;Deutsch-Soziale&quot; (German-social) Workers&#x27; Party. The Bohemian groups blocked the proposal, who did not want to copy the name of the Czech National Social Party. An early member of this group is Ferdinand Burschowsky, a printer from Hohenstadt (Moravia), who was active in writing and publishing.

==DNSAP==
At a party congress in Vienna in May 1918, the DAP changed its name to the &quot;Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei&quot; (DNSAP). It produced a National Socialist Program, which is thought to have influenced the later German Nazi manifesto. From 1920, the swastika was added as the party symbol. Before 1920, it consisted of a hammer, oak leaves and a quill.

The Austrian DNSAP split into several factions in 1923 and again in 1926, the &quot;Deutschsozialer Verein&quot; (German-Social Association) led by Dr. Walter Riehl, the &quot;Schulz-Gruppe&quot;, , and other splinter groups. After 1930, most former DNSAP members became supporters of the German NSDAP led by Austrian-born Adolf Hitler and were one of the chief elements leading the pro-Nazi coup in 1938 that brought about the Anschluss of Austria with Germany.

According to fascism scholar Stanley G. Payne, if elections had been held in 1933, the DNSAP might have mustered about 25% of the votes. Contemporary &quot;Time&quot; magazine analysts suggested a higher support of 50%, with a 75% approval rate in the Tyrol region bordering Nazi Germany.

Leaders of the party, who were dubbed &quot;Landesleiter&quot; due to the recognition of Hitler as overall &quot;Führer&quot;, included Alfred Proksch (1931–33), Hermann Neubacher (1935) and Josef Leopold (1936–38), although real power frequently lay with Theodor Habicht, a German sent by Hitler to oversee Nazi activity in Austria.

<text>The steppe eagle (Aquila nipalensis) is a large bird of prey. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. The steppe eagle&#x27;s well-feathered legs illustrate it to be a member of the subfamily Aquilinae, also known as the &quot;booted eagles&quot;. This species was once considered to be closely related to the sedentary tawny eagle (&quot;Aquila rapax&quot;) and the two forms have previously been treated as conspecific. They were split based on pronounced differences in morphology and anatomy; two molecular studies, each based on a very small number of genes, indicate that the species are distinct but disagree over how closely related they are.

The steppe eagle is in many ways a peculiar species of eagle. It is a specialized predator of ground squirrels on the breeding ground, also taking other rather small mammals and other prey, doing so more often when ground squirrels are less consistently found. In rather treeless areas of the steppe habitats, these eagles tend to nest on a slight rise, often on or near an outcrop, but may even be found on flat, wide-open ground, in a rather flat nest. They are the only eagle to nest primarily on the ground. Usually one to three eggs are laid and, in successful nests, one to two young eagles fledge. The steppe eagle undertakes a massive migration from essentially its entire breeding range, moving en masse past major migration flyways, especially those of the Middle East, Red Sea and the Himalayas. In winter, though less closely studied than during breeding, the steppe eagle is remarkable for its sluggish and almost passive feeding ecology, focusing on insect swarms, landfills, carrion and the semi-altricial young of assorted animals, lacking the bold and predatory demeanor of their cousin species. Although still seen by the thousands at migration sites in larger numbers than other migrating eagles of these areas, the steppe eagle&#x27;s entire population has declined precipitously. The threats to this species consist of increasing steppe fires and pests around the nests (both probably increased by the warming climate) which can cause a large volume of nest failures. Rivaling these factors, declines are being exacerbated by disturbance and persecution by humans, as well trampling of nests by livestock. Free-flying steppe eagles are also being killed in alarmingly large numbers, especially in the stronghold nation for breeding of Kazakhstan, by electrocutions on dangerous electricial wires and pylons. Due to these and other reasons, the decline of the species is thought to be considerably in excess of 50%. Therefore, the species is considered to be endangered by the IUCN. The steppe eagle appears on the flag of Kazakhstan and is the national bird of both Kazakhstan and Egypt.

==Taxonomy==
British naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson described the steppe eagle in 1833. &quot;Aquila&quot; is Latin for &quot;eagle&quot; while &quot;nipalensis&quot; means &quot;from Nepal&quot; based on the location where the type specimen was collected presumably while migrating. Samuel G. Gmelin however described a species of eagle from Tanais where they were found sitting on ancient mounds or graves of nomads. He called it &quot;Aquila mogilnik&quot;, the species name &quot;mogilnik&quot; meaning burial in Russian. This was included in the 13th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by his cousin J.F. Gmelin in 1788. The identity of this bird was however confused with &quot;A. heliaca&quot; but research in 2019 suggests that &quot;A. mogilnik&quot; can reliably be identified and that it would have been a valid senior name for &quot;A. nipalensis&quot; had it not been declared as a &quot;nomen dubium,&quot; a doubtful name by Ernst Hartert in 1914. The lack of usage of the name in literature now makes the name &quot;nomen oblitum&quot;, a valid senior name lost by disuse. The steppe eagle is a member of the booted eagle subfamily within the Accipitridae family. The booted eagle clan are monophyletic and study of karyotypes has indicated that they likely have few to no close external relations within the overall extant accipitrid family. The booted eagle subfamily all have feathers covering their legs and may be found to some extent on every continent that contains accipitrids. The genus &quot;Aquila&quot; traditionally comprises large and fairly dark eagles that tend to live in open habitats. However, a significant division was determined to exist between superficially similar eagles such as the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) and its three extant and similar-looking close cousins, as well as three very different smaller and pale-bellied eagles (the Bonelli&#x27;s, African hawk- and Cassin&#x27;s hawk-eagles) and the species complex which contains the steppe eagle. There is a similar genetic disparity with the golden eagle for the steppe eagle as with the spotted eagles which have been deemed distinct enough to form a separate genus, &quot;Clanga&quot;. The steppe eagle genetically clusters closely to the tawny eagle as well as, albeit more distantly, with the eastern (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;) and Spanish imperial eagles (&quot;Aquila adalberti&quot;). However, the loci evidenced in the &quot;Aquila&quot; genera have been found to be relatively homogenous, with general studies of isoenzymes showing their genes as about ten times less distanced than certain owl genera.

The steppe eagle has historically been considered conspecific with the tawny eagle, even until as recently as 1991. The latter species resides year-round in the African and Asian areas often used seasonally as wintering grounds by steppe eagle. The species were ultimately separated on the grounds of the differences in morphology, disparate coloring, distinct life histories and behaviours. Testing of genetic materials has reinforced the species distinction of the steppe and tawny eagles. Genetically, the steppe eagle is thought to be basal to related species such as the tawny and imperial eagles. A fossil species, &quot;Aquila nipaloides&quot;, has been found in Italy, Corsica, Sardinia and France and was hypothesized to most closely related to the steppe eagle based on osteology of the ramus (although did evidence some differences in leg morphology). Despite being even more strongly distinctive from the steppe eagle than the tawny eagle, the eastern imperial eagle has been seen to hybridize with the steppe eagles in the wild, once in Turkey and at least three times in Kazakhstan. Each hybrid with imperial eagles has been known to involve pairs of subadult or juvenile eagles and all known hybrid pairings were between male steppe eagles (or apparent steppe-imperial hybrids themselves) mated to female imperial eagles. Some of these hybrid pairs also produced seemingly healthy young with roughly intermediate characteristics.

The steppe eagle has been generally considered to contain two subspecies. One was the nominate subspecies, &quot;A. n. nipalensis&quot;, which breeds in the eastern portions of the range (perhaps from the East Kazakhstan Region to all points east) while the western breeding population, found in most of Kazakhstan and European Russia, was considered as the subspecies, &quot;A. n. orientalis&quot;. The separation of two subspecies was largely based on size, with the eastern population being larger and much heavier than the western eagles. The more eastern birds tend to be a shade darker and a have a more extensive nape patch, as well as having a more conspicuously deep gape-line. However, both western and Russian researchers have since made a convincing advocacy that the steppe eagle is actually a monotypical species. It was found that both previously claimed subspecies appear to broadly overlap in the breeding range and become indistinguishable at the Kazakh-Russian meeting point. The primary differences, i.e. in size and mildly in colour, can be explained as clinal variations due to the environment. The breeding populations of the eastern and western eagles are insufficiently allopatric and too extensively engage in introgression to be properly regarded as full subspecies. Erroneously, a checklist once included the former subspecies of &quot;A. n. orientalis&quot; as being part of the subspecies of tawny eagle from Asia, &quot;A. r. vindhiana&quot;, an error that was later corrected.

==Description==

The steppe eagle is a large, bulky and robust-looking eagle. It is mainly dark brown in colour with a longish but very thick neck and a relatively small head that nonetheless features a strong bill and long gape-line. It appears long-winged and has a longish and rather rounded tail and markedly well-feathered (almost with disheveled looking feathers) legs. Steppe eagles tend to perch somewhat upright and usually do so in the open, often utilizing isolated trees, posts, rocks or other suitable low lookouts such as mounds or straw-piles. The species often is seen on the ground where may stand for long periods of the day and walk with horizontal posture and with wingtips just exceed the tail-tip. Steppe eagles, like tawny eagles, can be relatively tame and approachable, at least compared to many of the other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles. The adult is a somewhat variable brown with darker centers to the greater coverts. More pronouncedly in the eastern part of the range, adults have normally prominent pale rufous to dull orange-yellow to yellow-brown patches on the nape and hindcrown. Any other paler areas (such as the feather tips of the back and uppertail coverts) are obscured on perched adults. The massive gape-line runs to level with the rear of eye (further emphasized by dark border against paler chin) and is longer than in any other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles including tawny eagles. Combined with their deep-set eyes, it lends steppe eagles an altogether rather fierce facial expression. Steppe eagle juveniles are almost invariably paler than adults, with some ranging overall from umber-brown to tawny-buff but then some are darker and more deeply brown. Juveniles tend to be brown to grey-brown on the upperparts but for generally rufous-buff nape patch (more so on eastern population). The juveniles bear conspicuously and broadly white-tipped black about the greater coverts, wings and tail and a bold but narrow cream band on the brown medians. The juvenile steppe eagle&#x27;s white uppertail coverts is generally concealed when perched; the underparts are usually the same as the upperparts but may be somewhat paler tawny-buff hue. Upon their 2nd year, the plumage is still much as the 1st year appearance but show the pale tips to secondaries, median coverts and tail as often well-worn and narrower; by the start of 2nd winter the, tips of retained juvenile flight-feathers and coverts are heavily abraded and very thin. By the end of 2nd winter, often the immatures look very worn and have nearly lost pale tips altogether and from 3rd year onward manifest a variable mix of old and new feathers. Generally, immatures are often rather scruffy in appearance until adult-like plumage attained at year five, after which the feathers generally appear more compact. Adults have brown to hazel eyes, while juveniles have distinctly dark brown eyes; the cere and feet are yellow at all ages.

In flight, the steppe eagle appears as a large, impressive and visibly heavy raptor with a well-projecting large head and bill and rather broad neck and long, broad wings. They evidence proportionately long arms, especially in the larger eastern birds. The wings tend to be held almost parallel-edged and square-ended with 7 very elongated emarginations. Often juveniles can tend to appear somewhat narrower winged. The broad body of the species often looks suspended underneath and the tail appears rounded or even wedge-shaped, measuring about 3/4 of the length of wing-base. The wingspan is about 2.6 times greater than the total body length. On the upperwings, steppe eagles show a pale greyish primary patch that is often quite large and obvious (especially on non-adults), often being pale at the base on the greater primary coverts but on adults (especially dark birds) much less marked. On the underwing, a very small carpal crescent may be present but can vary from invisible to slightly more marked. The flight feathers are greyish and all have 7–8 well-spaced blackish bars (albeit less conspicuously than on spotted eagles), while the fingers are plain blackish. Adults are basically all fairly uniform dark brown (wings can be negligibly greyer or rarely yellowish brown). Adults may evidence in flight some whitish patches on back and tail coverts that are varying from insignificant to fairly prominent. Adult eagles that do show a dark-barred greyish primary patch usually have that confined to a wedge-shape on inner primaries though can sometimes be rather more prominent. Below adults show dark-barred grey flight feathers and tail with the broad blackish trail edges and wing ends being rather distinctive; the wing linings are often slightly paler to darker than remiges and often with an obscure remnant of broken paler central band. Juveniles are quite distinctive in flight if seen in reasonable view. Above, juveniles are pale greyish-brown to yellow-brown about the body and forewing-coverts, have a broad whitish U above the tail. They possess broad white tips to the blackish greater coverts, flights feathers and tail creating obvious whitish bars on the wings and trailing edges as well as a large and prominent whitish patch covering much of the inner primaries (causing barring to stand out more so and offsetting plain black wing end). On its underside, the juvenile is mid-brown to brownish-yellow with a paler throat and creamy crissum. Below, the creamy central wing band is even broader than above, while the greater coverts all white with some dark centres on primaries (rare extreme pale individuals appear to have almost uniform paler colour on the entire wing lining and lesser and medians buffish-white to pale sandy, often whitish pale primary-wedges). Despite reports that some juvenile 1st years have subtle or no central wing bands, these are believed to be cases where these feathers exist but are obscured by long median coverts. At the end of the first year, the young steppe eagle tends to have pale tips to wings, tail and upperwing coverts become rather abraded; thereafter the development young evidence much variation due to individual differences. Usually, by the end of 2nd winter, the wing looks even more worn and uneven in pattern, with any newly acquired narrowly white-tipped quills clearly longer than old worn juvenile ones that have lost their pale tips. From the 3rd winter on, the pale parts clearly reduced, flight feathers and tail often appear quite ragged and by the 4th year start to more resemble adults. From the end of the 3rd year to when they obtain adult plumage, the eagles tend to have adult-like broad blackish trailing edges and tail often coupled with dark-barred grey base to black fingers and traces of the pale band along greater underwing-coverts. Maturity is obtained between the 4th and 5th years, not at 6–7 years as previously reported despite some presumed five-year-old eagles still have flecks of pale on the wing coverts and the throat and more subtle nape patches than they will ultimately manifest.
===Size===
The steppe eagle is large and impressive raptor and quite a large eagle. However, as a member of the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;, it is fairly medium-sized. Females can range to 15% larger with greater dimorphism by weight, which is more pronouncedly dimorphic than by linear dimensions. Total length can range from in fully-grown steppe eagles. Wingspan in full grown eagles of this species is very variable, with the smallest steppe eagles spanning as little as while the largest ones can reportedly span up to . Although some sources list the maximum wingspan as only , the maximum wing dimensions were apparently confirmed for the most massive steppe eagles (i.e. from Altai). Body mass, like wingspan, as reported is also fairly variable. Steppe eagles weighed for a Russia handbook were found to scale from in males while in females weights reported to range from . Elsewhere, the minimum full-grown weights for smaller western eagles (formerly subspecies &quot;A. n. orientalis&quot;) were for the smallest males while the heaviest females were found to have attained a weight around , while weights in the eastern part of the breeding range are around 20% heavier. In one sample of steppe eagles of possibly varied origins, males weighed a mean of and females a mean of . Wintering eagles of the species in southern Africa weighed a mean of in a sample of four. In Saudi Arabia, 21 steppe eagles at one study site weighed a mean of while 27 eagles at another study site there weighed a mean of . Unpublished weights from Israel were much lower at a reported mean of , as in other raptors during passage migration in Israel, weight loss may be significant relative to the other seasons. Steppe eagles diagnosed as from the smaller-bodied, western part of the breeding range weighed a mean of in 13 males and a mean of just under in a sample of 18 females while the mean weight of larger, eastern breeding bird was listed as in 2 males and in 2 females. The maximum cited weight for steppe eagle males in the wild is while that for females is . Among standard measurements, the wing chord can measure from in males and from in females. The tail may measure from in both sexes and the tarsus may be from in males and from in females, both fairly short for the size of the eagle (although its cousin fossil speciea, &quot;A. nipaloides&quot;, was apparently even shorter legged). Wing chord length averaged and in males and females in a study, respectively. The huge gape of a steppe eagle is from wide, with an average of in males and females, respectively, while the gape length is , averaging in the two sexes. The hallux claw, the enlarged killing talon on the rear foot of essentially all accipitrids measures from , averaging , in males from , averaging , in females. As in the tawny eagle and imperial eagles, the talon size is modest, whereas most species in the golden eagle clade are markedly larger clawed relative to their size.

===Confusion species===

In many circumstances, the steppe eagle can be very difficult to distinguish from other similar eagles, often especially during passage and winter. Adults are often confused with spotted eagles but are best separated by their much more broad build, far greater wing areas with longer, more rectangular or squarish wing tips and longer, more conspicuous fingers, larger head (rather than small and bull-headed) and larger overall size. Compared to the spotted eagles, the flight of the steppe eagle is more aquiline, i.e. more powerful, labored and deep while spotted eagles tend to fly more like buzzards. The lesser spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga pomarina&quot;), the most similarly marked of spotted eagles, is particularly less powerful looking with a shorter neck, much smaller wing areas, shorter fingers and tail and less extensive, baggy leg-feathering. The greater spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga clanga&quot;) is also smaller and slighter but to a reduced extent. When plumage is clear to see, steppe eagles have more clearly and more extensively barred quills and lack the clear carpal arcs of the two widespread spotted eagles but these differences are obscured at greater distances. Some subadult steppe eagles, with their paler brown wing-coverts above and below and only traces of white underwing bands and clearly pale primary patch above in particular quite resemble the plumage of older lesser spotted eagles. The white wing bars of steppe eagles are usually more conspicuous than those of the lesser spotted eagle. At close range, the steppe eagle has a deeper gape than lesser and greater spotted eagles and has rounded rather than oval nostrils. When seen perched, either on a perch or on the ground, spotted eagles of all three species tend to stand quite tall and upright, emphasizing their more slender and lightly feathered legs, while the steppe eagle sits more horizontally and is always far bulkier than even the biggest greater spotted eagles. Some particularly dark adult and subadult steppe eagles with obscured paler wing feathers can greatly resemble adult greater spotted eagles (the latter species can appear almost blackish in certain lights) and would need to be identified by the differences in size and form. The Indian spotted eagle (&quot;Clanga hastata&quot;) has a deep gape reminiscent of the steppe eagle but is much slighter in overall size, being similar in size or even smaller than a lesser spotted eagle, and has even less conspicuous whitish wing markings than the lesser spotted. As a result of their rough similarities, many young steppe eagles are misidentified, particularly from a distance, with spotted eagles although generally, identification is possible via a combination of structure and plumage features. Juvenile steppe eagles are normally readily identified by distinctive plumage features but can recall juvenile eastern imperial eagles, the latter has a longer and less rounded tail, a more prominent (rather than deeply set) bill, has a much paler and more buff overall colour while the chest is overlaid with brown streaking and the quills are unbarred. Imperial and steppe eagles are often similar in size, with more western breeding birds usually being somewhat smaller when seen side by side with an imperial eagle and the eastern steppe eagles being of similar average size (but even larger maximum size) compared to full-grown imperial eagles. Steppe eagles are told from tawny eagles by that species being smaller and less bulky with shorter wings, a smaller gape, a more slender neck and a relatively longer tail. Both the tawny and steppe eagle tend to have a distinct S-shape curvature to the trailing edge of the wings. When perched on the ground, the tawny eagle tends to stand more upright, while the steppe eagle often appears to assume a more elongated, horizontal posture. Plumage variations of tawny eagles can render them a surprisingly close colour to the usually darker, duller and browner steppe eagle (especially so in south Asia), but they never obtain the distinct whitish wing band of the young steppe eagle nor the nape patch of most adult steppes. Despite slight individual and clinal variations, the steppe eagle, unlike the tawny eagle, is not polymorphic. These aforementioned eagles present the main possibilities for confusion, less likely mistakes can potentially range from relatively dainty and much smaller Wahlberg&#x27;s eagles (&quot;Hieraeetus wahlbergi&quot;) (generally quite different in features but somewhat similarly hued) in Africa to the somewhat bigger but differently structured golden eagles (much longer tail, relatively smaller bill and much smaller gape, different wing shape, more aquiline build and bigger feet and talons) in much of the range.

==Distribution==
===Breeding range===

Although the breeding range is rather extensive, the steppe eagle is essentially confined to nesting in only four large nations: Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and China. However, the steppe eagle once bred in Europe. Here, they bred into the 20th century in at least southeasternmost Ukraine and perhaps elsewhere in eastern Europe. These eagles still rarely occur as breeders in southwest Russia from Stavropol to Astrakhan. The steppe eagle is still mapped to breed down to Makhachkala and Maykop to as far west as Leningradskaya, up north as far as the lower Volga and down to the Caspian Sea nearly as far as Makhachkala and south of Fort-Shevchenko. The breeding range extends through appropriate habitat in much of Kazakhstan, from north of Nur-Sultan south to (albeit spottily) to Kyzylorda as well as around the former Aral Sea. From their main breeding areas to the north, steppe eagles breed also marginally in northeastern Kyrgyzstan and perhaps northern Uzbekistan. The breeding distribution is essentially continuous as sweep far to the east in Russia as Transbaikal and Altai. The steppe eagle also breeds in large stretches of western and northern China such as Tian Shan, Xinjiang, the Gobi area, Gansu, Ningxia, northern Tibet (by far their southernmost breeding area), Inner Mongolia and reach their eastern breeding limits in Manchuria and elsewhere in northeastern China. The species breeding range is also quite broad into Mongolia excluding the northern portion. 

===Wintering range===
The steppe eagle is entirely migratory, wintering in east and, to a lesser extent, southern Africa. Their African range can extend western to southern Sudan, almost throughout east Africa, to the easternmost part of Democratic Republic of the Congo. The southern African wintering range extends to central Angola, northern and eastern Namibia south to Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini and northern South Africa, including former Transvaal and northern Natal as well as rarely south of the Orange River In South Africa, steppe eagles are reportedly often frequent only in the lowveld of Kruger National Park area. The steppe eagle&#x27;s wintering range also extends into the Middle East. They occur broadly in the season in several central and southern parts of the Arabian Peninsula as well as regularly in eastern Iraq and western Iran with odd ones north to Turkey and Georgia. Although sometimes recorded as occurring &quot;somewhat&quot; in Arabia, more extensive surveying has revealed that many, if not more, steppe eagles wind up winter in the peninsula rather than Africa, and that the largest ever winter numbers were recorded in Saudi Arabia, where around 7200 individuals (or perhaps up to 9% of the current world population) were recorded near Riyadh. As many as 3000 have also been similarly recorded in the nation of Oman. Other nations to host wintering steppe eagles include Yemen, Azerbaijan and Syria as well as, albeit rarely doing so, in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Kuwait.

Unusually, a few overwintering steppe eagles have been now recorded in Kazakhstan, apparently near Shymkent, in the Aksu-Zhabagly Nature Reserve, the valley of the Syr Darya, the Shardara Dam and towns of the East Kazakhstan Region. In south Asia, the species in winter may occur from Afghanistan (rarely wintering still in the Nuristan Province) and in much of the Indian subcontinent. Pakistan&#x27;s Poonch and Jhelum valleys of Azad Kashmir are known to host a mean of 154 steppe eagles per study area. In India, they may occur mainly south to Madhya Pradesh, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the Deccan Peninsula and Himalayan zone, Mizoram, Assam and southern Orissa. Vagrants have been recorded in India to Periyar National Park, Mahendragiri, Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary and Mudumalai National Park. The wintering range extends east to Tibet (although the species is said to be gone from Lhasa in recent years), Nepal, Burma and broadly in east China from southeastern Guizhou to Hainan and southwestern Guangdong. Recent wintering records reflect the species as lingering seasonally at different points of the non-breeding season, albeit very seldom, in central and southern Myanmar, western Thailand, peninsular Malaysia and northern Vietnam. The species may have been aided in expanding their eastward wintering range by deforestation practice. 
====Migratory range====
The steppe eagle appears broadly in many nations between their central Eurasian breeding areas and their generally tropical Indo and African wintering grounds. As a matter of fact, the largest concentrations of the species tend to occur at times of passage. The steppe eagle can also vagrate not infrequently far away from traditional migration sites, and has turned up in many areas from western Europe to as far east as Japan. Vagrant steppe eagles have been recorded in at least the following nations or regions: at least 6 nations in west Africa Morocco, Tunisia, the Netherlands, Finland (at least 50 times) as well as Spain and France, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania (in both of which they once bred but were extirpated), Greece Mordovia, Yakutia, the Korean Peninsula and probably down to Borneo in Asia. Migration sites include both mountainous ridges and the larger seas along their routes. Steppe eagles predominantly use two main migration routes: one radiates across the Middle East and Arabia, with many birds stopping to winter, but many too migrate around the Red Sea to winter in Africa while the other main migration path frequently involves farther eastern breeding eagles moving along many ridges and prominent flyways before radiated across a broad path through the Himalayas, in order to reach the south Asian and other Asian wintering sites. Less known or less frequently migration paths before these well-known routes of passage may lead steppe eagles around the Black Sea in the west and, much more frequently, around the Caspian Sea farther east. Nations known to be visited by steppe eagles almost exclusively in migratory passage include Egypt, most but not all of Syria, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan and much of east China from Tuquan County to about Xiamen. Points of migration bottleneck, where large numbers of steppe eagles are frequently recorded, are known in areas including Israel, especially around Eilat, Suez (in Egypt), Bab-el-Mandeb (in Yemen), some parts of the nation of Georgia and, in the Himalayan region, especially within Nepal but also sometimes en masse in Pakistan and northern India. Migration sites of minor significance are less known but include Alborz.

==Habitat==

===Breeding habitat===
The steppe eagle tends to breed in open dry country, within the characteristic habitat it is named after: the steppe both in both upland and lowland areas. In Kazakhstan, it is known to generally occur in drier parts of the steppe than some other raptors like harriers. This species generally avoids utilizing agricultural land such as arables and most other human-fragmented areas, however, they can be somewhat tolerant of nesting near roads. Associated habitats are frequented when breeding such as flat plains, arid grassland, semi-desert and even desert edge. Most members of the species breed at lower levels but largely in eastern part of the range also will nest in poorly vegetated dry rocky hillsides such as granite massifs and upland valleys, though generally avoid truly mountainous areas. 

===Wintering habitat===
Wintering steppe eagles often occur much more frequently in human-modified areas in order to access easy foods. These include landfills and livestock carcass dumps, these being used frequently everywhere from Arabia to India. More natural habitats used most often by wintering steppe eagles tend to be various wetlands or other waterways where they are available. In winter, mostly savanna and grasslands are the predominant habitat used in Africa, also sometimes dry woodland. Study in Botswana indicated that wintering steppe eagles there appeared to be indifferent to land use changes by humans. In Zambia and Malawi, it was found that the steppe eagle was only frequent in high-elevation plateau areas from metres above sea level. Use of plateaus was also frequent in Zimbabwe, often where open savanna woods of &quot;Acacia&quot; stand as well as the use of cultivated areas such as wheat stubble fields by eagles. Iraqi wintering steppe eagles often used dump sites as well as deserts and semi-arid areas, with more steppe, other grassland and mountain slopes used in northern Iraq in winter. In Armenia steppe eagles are apparently frequent in old fields and orchards. In south Asia they usually use open country and often frequents large lakes and other wetlands near arid areas but may accept, or even prefer, more heavily wooded areas (however the first records from peninsular Malaysia seem to be from open areas created by deforestation). Although usually a breeder of lowlands, it has been known to live at elevations of up to and locally to in mountains, on passage can occur to over sometimes even to , as was recorded on Mount Everest. Compared to other Palearctic migrating eagles, the steppe eagle seems to perhaps be slightly more tolerant of a wider range of climatic conditions, including rather humid conditions in India provided subsistence is available as well as up to of snow cover in Kazakhstan (living off of urban pests).

==Behaviour==

The steppe eagle is sometimes regarded as solitary but is frequently seen in the company of conspecifics throughout the year. Besides the obvious breeding pair, they often flock during migration and aggregate in occasionally ample numbers during non-breeding times, usually at fruitful feeding sites, sometimes briefly cooperating with one another especially to klepoparasitize other birds of prey. Steppe eagles fly with slow, deep and stiff-looking wing beats, holding wings fully extend on upstrokes, rendering a heavier flight pattern than spotted eagles. The flight of the steppe eagle is well-analyzed such as experiments with a captive male and observations of migrants in Israel. It appears that the underwing coverts operate as a high-lift device and probably provide stability through unsteady maneuvers, otherwise positive loading on the wings can be maintained. Whilst soaring, generally the wings are held flattish or slightly flexed but sometimes with the hands lowered. About 90% of flight by these eagles in Israel was gliding or soaring. They often fly with the head dropped with hands arched in a glide or often arms straight out and hands drooped. The drooping wing flight method, peculiar to the steppe eagle as well as to the greater spotted eagle, is sometimes also called the &quot;tuck&quot;, and is thought to be a gust response precipitated by a transient drop in aerodynamic loading. Steppes adapt their flight to wind and thermal conditions as was studied in Israel, increasing their gliding airspeed under strong thermal convections or opposing winds. This study determined that a combination of circling in thermals and inter-thermal gliding was interspersed with soaring in straight-line glide. Israeli migrants flew up to above the ground but 90% were under and half were below . The Israeli steppe eagles were able to maintain a mean climbing rate of per second, a mean cross-country air speed of per second and a mean of per second in glides; the flight was similar as in other common raptors here but the steppe eagle attained the highest mean cross-country speeds. Steppe eagles tend not to be very vocal especially when not breeding. Their main call is a raspy bark which is similar to that a tawny eagle, despite being mildly deeper. In aerial displays, a loud whistle has been recorded, quite unlike any vocalization of a tawny eagle. Other call recorded have included mainly low and croaking notes aside from a high shriek when startled.

===Migration===

Steppe eagles appeared to have evolved the strategy of migrating from their breeding grounds, due in large part to the temporary seasonal availability of their main prey, ground squirrels. They probably migrate in greater numbers than any other eagle in the world and can appear to be frequent enough at migration sites that they may mask less numerous migrating eagles that are mistakenly missed in their ranks. The migratory behaviour of this species is arguably amongst the best-studied aspect of its entire biology. Autumn migration often begins around October on fairly broad fronts, and may peak around late October. It usually ends in late November to December but steppe eagles frequently travel somewhat nomadically while not breeding and so individuals may not reach their winter terminus point until about January. Spring migration usually commences in February, peaking early from late February to March, with likely all gone from Africa by the end of the latter month, then continuing in a diminishing trickle into April and May. In passage at Suez, the steppe eagle is one of the earlier migrating raptors on average alongside the long-legged buzzard (&quot;Buteo rufinus&quot;), averaging about a month sooner in passage than the common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;) (the most common migrant there) and slightly sooner than the lesser spotted eagle, as well as much sooner than some other raptors there. On average, the wintering period in Africa is relatively brief, at a mean of about up to about 4 months (down to about 2), while adult steppe eagles spend up to 7 months (max of around 5 months for a young eagle) on their breeding grounds. In autumn records from Africa, younger eagles migrate the earliest and adults the latest. Radio-tagging studies confirmed, much as in the lesser spotted eagle, that in spring juveniles migrated later, wandering about more so and came back to the summering grounds much later. One young steppe eagle that was banded in passage in the United Arab Emirates wintered initially in Yemen before returning for the summer to Kazakhstan, then migrating to eastern Africa the following winter, showing that they can change their migratory habits over time. Many studies corroborate that steppe eagles generally migrate lesser distances as they age.

Peak movements around the Red Sea show as many as 76,000 steppe eagles moving over Bab-el-Mandeb in the fall of 1987, with up to 65,000 (in 1981) in Suez and up to 75,000 in Eilat, Israel in the year 1985. Once migrating steppe eagles enter Africa in autumn, no mass migrations have been recorded anywhere for the species in the continent. Although not large, some semi-significant spring movements were detected in Egypt, despite none being recorded in the fall. In autumn, steppe eagles usually pass over Bab-el-Mandeb in the north of Red Sea while in spring they predominantly cross to the south of the Red Sea around Suez. The mean number of steppe eagles that annually pass over Eilat in spring are estimated at 28,032 with a mean peak day of 10 March, making them roughly the fourth most common migrating raptor in spring there (and they often pass in intermingled flocks with other soaring raptors, but not those with powered flight). In Eilat, steppe eagles constitute 6.4% of all raptors seen, nearly all of the &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles seen and, among those that could be aged, an estimated 60–70% of the steppes seen were thought to be adults. More unusually, the steppe eagle may be the only raptor to also use Israel as a common migratory flight path in autumn as well as spring, with even commoner migrating raptors such as common buzzards and European honey buzzards (&quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;) being rare there in the fall. In Nepal over 2.5 weeks starting on 20 October, nearly 7852 steppe eagles were tallied, making up more than 80% of the recorded migrating raptors, with peak times of movement being between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, especially between noon and 2:00 PM. Over 3 years of study in Nepal, 21,447 steppe eagles were recorded (as many as 1102 within a day and a mean of about 15.2 an hour) at the counting sites. Strong evidence of east-to-west migratory movements, rather than south or northbound, has been made in the Kathmandu Valley. It was indicated based on the directional studies that especially juveniles from the eastern part of the breeding may be more frequently migrate westbound to reach wintering areas such as the Middle East and Africa. On the contrary, juveniles and subadults during the wintering season seem to considerably outnumber adults in the Indian subcontinent so many do head due south. Of 3381 ageable steppe eagles in passage in Nepal, 56% were juveniles or immature, 44% were adults; of 7852 eagles, 58% migrated in groups of 1–5, 30% in 5–20 groups and 12% in larger flocks. In Himachal Pradesh of India, about 11,000 steppe eagles were recorded in autumn migration in 2001 and about 40% less were counted the next spring. This study indicated different migratory paths being used in the seasons, presumably following the winds predominant direction around the terrain, with the westerly autumn migration mostly in the western Himalayas and the easterly spring migration more so in the east of Nepal. Staging areas are not well-delineated in India but appear to concentrate around feeding sites such as landfills. A single female that was radio-tagged in Mongolia was recorded to travel southwest and stop in southeastern Tibet, which is also the southernmost part of the species breeding range. The data from this female indicated that not all steppe eagles move to warmer climates and, based on that she remained stationary until her return to Mongolia, that she was not nomadic as many eagles of the species are. During return spring migration, the steppe eagles in passage in Nepal will reportedly amass into groups of approximately 5 to 20 eagles at only about above the terrain before rising up to cross between the snow-covered peaks. 

16 radio-tagged eagles that returned in their first spring migration to their Kazakh summering grounds were recorded to winter as first-year juveniles either, in roughly equal measure, in the Arabian Peninsula or southern Africa, and covered straight-line distances, ranging from , although individually could meander up to for one eagle migrating from wintering grounds Botswana. Of the 16 returning Kazakhstan eagles, spring migration lasted an average of 40 days, ranging individually from 38 to 54 days and covered a mean of each day. The migration path generally led the eagles around almost every direction of the Red Sea, many also passing over Israel and some wrapping around the Caspian Sea. A different radio-tagging study of 19 juveniles (about 57% of which survived) from Russian or Kazakh sites found that autumn movements in the 1st year migration averaged and confirmed not only that they freely changed wintering sites anywhere from India to southern Africa but they never returned, surviving or not, to their natal site in the 1st year, instead return to wandering widely across the northern steppe. The 1st migration averaged 52 days and were much briefer for females than for males, with the discrepancies more pronounced for eagles originating from the Altai Mountains. 15 birds tracked in this study were found to have migrated most frequently to winter in south Pakistan (right along the borderlands to India) or in eastern Turkmenistan. Spring migration began on a mean date of 25 March for the 15 young eagles and lasted about 26 days on average, covering a mean of , with females initiating migration on average 18 days later than males and migrating more briefly, more quickly and more often with fewer stops than males. 9 eagles which were tracked successfully in their first spring passage in this study wandering widely mostly in natural steppe hunting for squirrels and 8 of these tracked to their 2nd autumn migration took about 1.5 times shorter on their 2nd autumn passage and migrated about 17% less far on average.

==Dietary biology==

The steppe eagle is an opportunistic predator like other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles but has a number of dietary and foraging peculiarities. They prey mainly on small-sized mammals, with some birds (such as queleas) and reptiles and (mostly in winter) frequently insects (such as termites and locusts) and carrion. Despite their opportunistic nature, the steppe eagle is a somewhat specialized predator on particular mammals such as ground squirrels while breeding and, during non-breeding times, feeds on various foods but is often peculiarly narrow in dietary selection, preferring massed food sources that require little effort for them to obtain. Various other small or medium-sized mammals can become the most significant prey locally on the breeding grounds, such as voles, pikas and zokors and, generally more secondarily, marmots, hares, gerbils, hedgehogs and others. During the breeding season, one resource claimed that prey mostly weighs . Another account estimated that about 95% of prey weighed less than , although predominantly over . However, yet another resource claimed that staple prey for steppe eagles could weigh anywhere from up to . Even the latter estimate may be conservative in size range, with prey species varying widely in size from very small insects from colonies to unexpectedly large mammals (and seldom birds) apparently killed near nests. On the other hand, a preference has indeed been detected for smaller burrowing mammals (i.e. probably under or so). Studies have determined where only larger species of burrowing mammals are predominant (even the larger species of ground squirrel), the steppe eagles appear to attain comparatively sparse nest densities, only occurring in high densities where the smaller burrowers are profuse. Ecological partitioning to limit interspecific competition may be a factor that dictates the steppe eagle&#x27;s preference for relatively small prey. The breeding steppe eagle mainly hunts in a low soaring or gliding flight, at a maximum of , diving or making short, accelerated stoops onto their prey. Usually, they tend to capture their prey on the ground. Steppe eagles have been recorded in both Kazakhstan and Mongolia to tactfully avoid casting a shadow before descending onto prey and may drop stones to provide a distraction, a probable form of tool use. In the Kazakh observation, the steppe eagles quickly became used to agricultural activity adjacent to prey accesses while they hunted. They also may hunt in any season on the ground, moving with a shambling gait as necessary, and may give chase on foot to both vertebrate and insect prey. Steppe eagles can often ambush prey by standing in wait next to burrows, suddenly pouncing quickly onto the quarry upon its emergence. Steppe eagles have been seen in China to buzz through locust swarms on the wing as well as to taking avian prey from over above the ground in a dive. Tandem hunting by pairs has been recorded during the breeding season while, in winter and migration, these may be the most social of all eagles, often sharing by up to the dozens abundant food sources. The non-breeding steppe eagle flocks may even seem to assist one another in procuring prey from which they themselves are not likely to be able to directly profit and may repeatedly assist each other until all flock members are satiated. If confirmed, this mutually beneficial foraging strategy between presumably unrelated eagles is truly unique. Much like the tawny eagle, the steppe eagle will readily rob other raptors of their catches, approaching from any angle and pursuing closely until the victim is forced to land or drop its food.

===Summer diet===
The single prey species most strongly associated with the steppe eagle is the little ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus pygmaeus&quot;). In some areas, as much as 98% of the diet reportedly can be little ground squirrels. This is a smallish ground squirrel though it is actually not greatly smaller than many other Eurasian ground squirrels, at a mean adult weight of about . The little ground squirrel once reached densities of around 30–40 per hectare and provided a reliable food source for these eagles. However, this species has plummeted in population density, in Kalmykia for instance going down from abundant in diverse habitats to perhaps locally extinct before gradually trickling back up in numbers (which continue to be a mere shadow of what they once were). The local steppe eagles of Kalmykia continue to show a strong preference for little ground squirrels. A continued primary reliance on little ground squirrels by steppe eagles was also found recent in studies from Saratov and Lake Baskunchak as well. Out of Russian, in the Karaganda Region of Kazakhstan, little ground squirrels again were an important identified food source, at 19.25% of 400 prey items. In the general area between the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea, 112 prey items were led by little ground squirrels, at just over 33%. However, in this data, the little ground squirrels were closely followed in number (29.7%) by the yellow ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus fulvus&quot;), which, with seasonal weights ranging from , is the largest of Eurasian ground squirrels. The little ground squirrel is only found in a substantial portion of the western part of the range, so elsewhere steppe eagles tend to prey on different prey species while breeding, though generally continue to take small burrowing mammals, of course. 

Around Lake Balkhash in Kazakhstan, the main prey was reportedly the red-cheeked ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus erythrogenys&quot;), a slightly larger ground squirrel than the little species at a mean adult weight of . Other prey noted here included Pallas&#x27;s pika (&quot;Ochotona pallasi&quot;), Libyan jird (&quot;Meriones libycus&quot;) and tolai hare (&quot;Lepus tolai&quot;). In Xinjiang, reportedly the main prey species is the long-tailed ground squirrel (&quot;Urocitellus undulatus&quot;). In the Altai region, the leading prey may be the Siberian zokor (&quot;Myospalax myospalax&quot;), which is the size of a large ground squirrel at an adult weight of about . However, some report in the Altai region that the main prey is the long-tailed ground squirrel and the migration arrival times do seem to correspond closely with this species hibernation emergence period. Yet another primary prey resource reported for steppe eagles in the Altai is the much larger gray marmot (&quot;Marmota baibacina&quot;). All the primary prey in the previously little reported Altai population are as adults well over what is considered the typical prey size range for this eagle, such as long-tailed ground squirrels, zokors and marmots as well as ptarmigan, and in turn, this may favor the large size of the steppe eagles from this region. On the contrary, other predominant prey in steppe eagle nests can be even smaller than ground squirrels. In Mongolia, the main prey by a large margin was reportedly the Brandt&#x27;s vole (&quot;Lasiopodomys brandtii&quot;), which weigh about . In the Transbaikal region, the main prey may be the Daurian pika (&quot;Ochotona dauurica&quot;), which weighs about . This pika can account for around 39%, as was the case in 62 prey items, (and perhaps up to 62% locally) of the diet in the region. Another study reported a very different primary food source for the Transbaikal, which was the young of the much larger Tarbagan marmot (&quot;Marmota sibirica&quot;), which were estimated in the study to be from 55 to 77% of the annual diet. Even more conflicting data found that some Transbaikal steppe eagles derived as much as 70% of their foods from long-tailed and Daurian ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus dauricus&quot;). It is possible that in both Altai and Transbaikal that the shifts to differing reported primary prey species are responses of the eagles to shifting prey availabilities as many burrowing mammals are subject to population cycles as well as human-sourced depletions. While rodents and some lagomorphs are usually favored in the diet, in some areas steppe eagles can live at least in part off of quite different prey such as long-eared hedgehogs (&quot;Hemiechinus auritus&quot;). Other notable prey taken regularly whilst breeding by steppe eagles includes steppe pika (&quot;Ochotona pusilla&quot;) (especially in the Volga region), alpine pika (&quot;Ochotona alpina&quot;), yellow steppe lemming (&quot;Eolagurus luteus&quot;) (especially in eastern Kazakhstan), or the slightly larger types of gerbil such as great gerbils (&quot;Rhombomys opimus&quot;) and Mongolian gerbils (&quot;Meriones unguiculatus&quot;). The study of the Karaganda region of Kazakhstan with 400 prey items found illustrated that the steppe eagle is capable of deriving a living from a wide range of prey, with the foods led by rosy starling (&quot;Pastor roseus&quot;) (mostly fledglings), at 24%, unidentified &quot;Microtus&quot; voles, at 19.75%, followed by little ground squirrels, unspecified pikas (8.25%), European hares (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;) (5%) and grey partridges (&quot;Perdix perdix&quot;) (4.5%). An aptitude for avian prey was detected in Transbaikal particularly, including Daurian partridge (&quot;Perdix dauurica&quot;) and Japanese quail (&quot;Coturnix japonica&quot;) (the latter at up to 15.6% of the diet). In Altai, assorted corvids (at up to 24.2% of the diet), probably mostly rooks (&quot;Corvus frugilegus&quot;) and Eurasian magpie (&quot;Pica pica&quot;), were important to diet as were willow ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus lagopus&quot;). Within the Saratov area, medium-sized birds were frequently reported in the diet, such as grey partridges, little bustards (&quot;Tetrax tetrax&quot;), northern lapwings (&quot;Vanellus vanellus&quot;) and rooks. A diversity of small passerines has been found in the diet, especially fledgling-age larks of various species, most frequently perhaps in Kazakhstan and Mongolia. A few reptiles found in the diet around nest have included at least sand lizard (&quot;Lacerta agilis&quot;), Caspian whipsnake (&quot;Dolichophis caspius&quot;) and steppe viper (&quot;Vipera ursinii&quot;).

On occasion, during summer, a steppe eagle may be able to take exceptionally large prey. The most regular large prey to appear in their diets are usually Tolai hare, at about , and assorted marmots. The upper size of marmots that the steppe eagle may attack is not well-established although this eagle is more tend to focus on small emergent juveniles around . Besides marmots and hares, steppe eagle takes a diversity of largish mammalian carnivores. Corsac fox (&quot;Vulpes corsac&quot;) and mustelids such as steppe polecats (&quot;Mustela eversmanii&quot;) are readily taken on some occasions, pallas cats (&quot;Otocolobus manul&quot;) and Rüppell&#x27;s foxes (&quot;Vulpes rueppellii&quot;) can be taken as well. Additionally, the remains of the red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) were found at the nest.

A broad range of young ungulates have also been found in small numbers and it is likely that some are taken both as carrion and as kills, including goitered gazelle (&quot;Gazella subgutturosa&quot;), Mongolian gazelle (&quot;Procapra gutturosa&quot;), saiga antelope (&quot;Saiga tatarica&quot;) and domestic goat (&quot;Capra aegagrus hircus&quot;). In newborns of these species, weights can vary from around (in goats) to about (in saiga antelope). The taking of large birds is less well-documented than predation on large mammals and in some cases both in summer and during non-breeding times certainly pertain to nestling predations, such as on storks and cranes, or to pilfering easy large fowl like chickens (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) or domestic turkeys (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;).

===Non-breeding diet===

The steppe eagle, despite being one of the most numerous and widely distributed of all eagles, is exceptionally poorly studied in its non-breeding dietary habits. This is due in large part to the nomadic behaviour displayed by most (but not all) steppe eagles during these times. Steppe eagles are fairly different from related species, being rather gregarious and non-predatory while away from their breeding grounds. Exceptionally, some steppe eagles have been known to overwinter in Altai Town, Kazakhstan, living reportedly off of brown rats (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;) and rock doves (&quot;Columba livia&quot;). They are often seen congregating at feeding sites with easily obtained foods that are available in large quantities. In southern Africa, these eagles are often associated with rain fronts and the humidity that accompanies them. They do this largely to exploit a certain food source, termite alates. Termites are known to emerge more extensively in these conditions and so the steppe eagle, not unlike other long-distance migrant raptors, can become locally rather insectivorous to the exception of virtually any other foods. Most often, these eagles will fly down when it is noticed that termites are emerging or wait on foot and then grab them. According to one account these large eagles feed on termites &quot;lumbering after their minuscule quarry in ludicrous fashion&quot;. They have also sometimes been seen to take termites in the air and feed on them in flight, not any easy task for such a large eagle. Roosts near termite colonies can contain several steppe eagles which may remain over days but generally depart whether well-fed or not if the rains disperse. In Namibia, the roosts used were the tops of quite small trees of only height. Although tiny with an average estimated weight of only , the harvester termite (&quot;Hodotermes mossambicus&quot;) (the main termite prey) have been deemed highly nutritious with a relatively high caloric value. It has been estimated that a steppe eagle would have to eat approximately 1600–2200 termites a day, which can be attainable in about 3 hours of feeding. The stomachs of 2 dissected steppe eagles contained 630 and 930 termite heads, respectively. In Zimbabwe, steppe eagles have also been seen in feeding masses in stubble fields picking out insects. However, it would reductive to consider the steppe eagle largely insectivorous in winter, since disproportionately the eagles seen feeding on termites in southern Africa were juveniles and immatures and many of the species winter outside of southern Africa; often wintering steppe eagles from other areas do not seem to live predominantly on insects. In east Africa, the diet of steppe eagles is poorly documented but is reported to consist largely of silvery mole-rats (&quot;Heliophobius argenteocinereus&quot;) and blesmols of the genus &quot;Cryptomys&quot;. Routine predation, probably on young or weak individuals, by steppe eagles has been recorded amongst flamingo colonies in east Africa. In several parts of Africa, steppe eagles may routinely visit and feed off of the colonies of the super-abundant bird, the red-billed quelea (&quot;Quelea quelea&quot;), with a noted focus on picking off the seemingly innumerous nestlings and fledglings of this small passerine. The steppe eagles will reportedly do so by ungracefully scrambling amongst the branches of the nesting colonies.

In the Indian subcontinent, the steppe eagle appears to fulfill the role of a weakly predatory opportunist. Individual Indian wintering steppe eagles are reported to feed at times of vulnerability of prey, including injured birds, eggs and young water birds from heronries, while groups of the eagles often occur around carrion, masses of stranded fish, poultry farms, garbage dumps and livestock carcass dumps. In Chari-Dhand wetlands, as many as 1000 steppe eagles have been seen to gather, presumably living largely off of vulnerable water birds. At the city dumps of Pune as many as 200 steppe eagles have been known to gather and feed. A carcass dump in Jorbeer near Bikaner was recorded to host an average of 43 steppe eagles per day during winter, with a peak number generally occurring in January and February (common dates from November to March and more rarely from September to May), with as many as 136 steppe eagles plus at least 9 other large raptors (mostly vultures), many of which are considered threatened species. It was found the Jorbeer carcass dumps enticed the steppe eagles to venture away from the normal wetland or wetland-adjacent areas used by steppe eagles in the area to the desert-like region, but feral dogs could, in some years, appear to chase off and cause the eagles to avoid this dump. A concentration of around 50 steppe eagle was seen to feed on swarms of locusts in Nepal. Perhaps to avoid competition (i.e. from vultures, jackals and so on) and to monopolize a food item, steppe eagles in India appear to come largely to smaller carcasses such as those of jungle cats (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;) and pythons. In the Banni Grasslands Reserve, steppe eagles are reported to largely hunt for food unlike in many other Indian reports, mainly on lesser bandicoot rats (&quot;Bandicota bengalensis&quot;), although also sometimes stole prey from other raptors. Similarly, active predation was unusually reported in Saurashtra and on larger prey including mongoose and Indian hare (&quot;Lepus nigricollis&quot;) as well as an unsuccessful attack on a mountain gazelle (&quot;Gazella gazella&quot;) fawn. 

In the region of Bharatpur, Rajasthan, largely around Keoladeo National Park, the foraging activities of steppe eagles have been observed extensively. The steppe eagles seldom actively hunted, instead alternating between capturing nestlings from the heronries, especially nearly fledgling-age young of late nesting painted storks (&quot;Mycteria leucocephala&quot;), and engaging in kleptoparasitism towards other birds of prey, often doing so in groups of about three to nine eagles. More infrequently, steppe eagles in Bharatpur have been seen hunting flocking birds, fish (usually stranded), lizards and snakes. The steppes have been observed feeding on freshly killed young water birds at Bharatpur at daybreak and during early mornings and so may hunt while taking advantage of bright moonlight. Piracy against other raptors often resulted in food wastage, since the steppe eagles often forced the other raptors to drop their catch but the steppes were unable to intercept them and the kills were frequently lost into the water. In Bharatpur, the steppe eagles tended to perch relatively low compared to other eagles, at about in the trees, and to perch often for longer periods than other raptors, apparently while watching closely the activity of the other birds of prey. Of a total of 49 observed hours of activity for steppe eagles in Bharatpur, 45% of it was spent foraging, with a maximum foraging time of 69% during January, then reduced in March to only 17%. The daily food intake of individual steppe eagles was extremely low relative to their size, at only . Instead of piracy, the steppe eagles often engaged each other in what can be considered a play display, almost exclusively between juvenile steppe eagles. In it, two birds circled or more, the higher bird circling closer and dropping toward the lower bird with extended feet, forcing it to roll over and present talons, they either immediately disengage with or without locking talons or descend looked for a few metres before separating; often steppes will fly purposely at a conspecific that is circling and fly up to a higher position so it can drop onto the other; in another incident, a steppe grabbed a plastic bag and let it go buffeting by the wind, then repeatedly caught it and let it go again, ultimately being joined by 5–6 other steppes in the &quot;game&#x27;.

Less study has been conducted on feeding habits of the wintering and migrating steppe eagles in the Asia Minor, Middle East and Arabian Peninsula. What is known suggests that they, even more strongly than wintering steppe eagles in Indian subcontinent, today frequent various waste food sources inadvertently provided to them by humans. In Muscat, Oman, migrants largely from Kazakhstan were recorded to live off a mixture of refuse from the region&#x27;s main landfill and large-scale carcass dump sites. As in the carcass dump areas of the Indian subcontinent, these carcass dumps often host a wide array of large birds of prey, both migrating species and non-migratory ones. In keeping with its size, steppe eagles dominated slightly smaller eagles and vultures and were in turn dominated by slightly larger eagles and much larger vultures. High use of slaughterhouses and cattle dump sites was recorded in winter in Iran. Interestingly, the Iranian slaughterhouses and dump sites hosted no first-year juveniles and few adults, but many steppe eagles either aged to 2 to 3 years of age (62.5%) or 4 to 5 years of age (33.3%). Foraging in both dump sites and available wetlands has been recorded in Iraq as well. Incidental feeding observations from Armenia suggests that steppe eagles in passage and in winter there are able to capture large quantities of voles or pirate them or similar small prey from smaller species of birds of prey.

===Interspecific predatory relationships===

The steppe eagle shares its distribution with several other birds of prey that can compete for resources. Most similar in feeding niche are largely other eagles, many of which are also similarly migratory. One eagle of similar central distribution is the eastern imperial eagles. The imperial eagle has a similar morphology and can broadly overlap in food selection. It also takes many ground squirrels but is generally less specialized on them during breeding, and often takes similar or larger numbers of prey such as hares, hedgehogs, hamsters and assorted birds both large and medium. In general, the dietary biology is better understood, prey is taken of more diverse sizes and the prey spectrum is far more diverse (perhaps nearly three times as many recorded prey species) in the imperial species. The average weight taken of prey like young marmots is similar in both eagles, averaging in the eastern imperial while the steppe also takes marmots of around this size. Although not common, the imperial eagle can sometimes take prey weighing over , probably rather more frequently than the steppe eagle. It is possible that the steppe eagle gained the preference for relatively more numerous and social but quite small mammals as prey to avoid heavier competition over slightly larger but often more dispersed terrestrial mammals (i.e. hares, hedgehogs, etc.), especially those taken by imperial eagles. Also, the imperial eagle is rather more predatory in food obtainment while wintering, not infrequently eschewing the more vulnerable nestling water birds in the Indian subcontinent to take many adult birds such as waterfowl and coots. The eastern imperial eagle differs most significantly from steppe eagles in nesting habits, favoring tall trees, sometimes in fairly well-wooded areas, which quite contrary to the steppe eagles ground nesting preferences. The migratory course used by imperial eagles is largely the same as the steppe eagle but the imperial is the far less numerous migrant (also more frequently overwintering near their breeding ground) and radiates less far in winter (especially in Africa). Despite the steppe eagle averaging scarcely smaller, data from both breeding and wintering areas indicates that the imperial eagle tends to be behaviorally dominant over steppe eagles. This has manifested in full or partial displacement of steppe eagles locally using pylons as nesting sites by imperial eagles. Furthermore, at shared feeding sites, the steppe eagle tends to back down to the imperial eagle, often allowing it to feed first despite occasional displacement of imperials with full crops. On occasion, in India, steppe eagles succeed in pirating prey from imperial eagles, normally in cooperating parties of steppe eagles. In at least one case in India, the steppe eagle was the aggressor in an interaction with an eastern imperial eagle, causing the two eagles to lock talons and cartwheel down with uncertain results. While the eagles are expected to correspond their sizes in hierarchy when nests are located in the same general area, with the steppe considered as generally subordinate to the imperial which is itself subordinate to the golden eagle, interactions in the Altai region suggest a more complex interspecific relationship. There one study reported several aggressive interactions with both imperial and golden eagles and the steppes were surprisingly the aggressors in each. In one instance, a golden eagle was fiercely attacked by a steppe eagle who appeared to dominate the interaction, grabbing the more formidable-armed golden in air and driving it forcefully to the ground (although the golden eagle was not killed).

Much has been written about what separates the steppe from the tawny eagle but little to no interactions between the species have been noted in the wild. Beyond being strongly allopatric, wintering steppe eagles usually use slightly different habitats, favoring available wetlands quite apart from the arid wooded savanna and semi-desert areas preferred by tawny eagles. The tawny eagle, despite being smaller and proportionately similar in talon size (with a considerably less massive gape), is a rather more powerful and bold predator than the steppe eagle, alternating between capturing relatively large prey, pirating prey from other raptors and scavenging on carrion. The prey sizes taken by tawny eagles are perhaps the most evenly distributed across all weight classes besides the eastern imperial and golden eagles amongst &quot;Aquila&quot; and &quot;Clanga&quot; species, with a focus on prey weighing from , i.e. well over the typical prey sizes for steppe eagles in any area. Tawny eagles occasionally attend the same food sources as wintering steppes, such as carcass dumps, other carrion and termite alates, and appear to largely ignore each other; on the other hand, an assertive steppe can sometimes displace a tawny eagle. Apart from imperial eagles, steppe eagles were said to be dominant over other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles and spotted eagles in the guild of raptors in Bharatpur. The steppe eagle is quite similar to the lesser and greater spotted eagles in migratory behaviour, but tends to specialize on entirely different prey during breeding. The spotted eagles tend to nest in well-wooded areas near water and catch diverse prey, although usually focus on fairly small prey as does the steppe eagle. The mean prey sizes taken by greater spotted eagles, with a diet often focused on various water-friendly rodents and medium-sized birds, is probably quite similar to that of the steppe eagles, whilst that of lesser spotteds, focused on voles, frogs and small snakes, is expectedly smaller. Especially in Africa, lesser spotted eagles become locally specialized termite eaters very much like the steppe eagle. Spotted eagles appear to be almost invariably dominated by steppe eagle, as has been recorded at carcass dumps during winter. In Bharatpur, spotted eagles species (Indian and greater) are quite often the targets of piracy by steppe eagles. Egyptian vultures (&quot;Neophron percnopterus&quot;) appear to be subordinate to steppe eagles at carrion but most other vultures are larger (sometimes considerably so) and may be avoided by steppe eagles, although they often fed at carcass dumps alongside assorted vultures. Many other diurnal raptors may share the ground squirrel and other prey that the steppe eagle often subsists on but are generally less specialized and tend to use different nesting habits, usually nesting in trees. These may include saker falcons (&quot;Falco cherrug&quot;), long-legged buzzards and other buzzards while larger golden eagles and smaller upland buzzards (&quot;Buteo hemilasius&quot;) often nests in rocks at considerably more elevated altitudes (although the golden may too nest in trees and other habitats). 

Smaller raptors like harriers are often the only other diurnal birds of prey to regularly nest on the ground and may co-occur over much of the range of steppe eagles, although usually use damper parts of the steppe as nesting habitats than the eagles. Harriers also often use similar migration routes as do the steppe eagles. In Africa, steppe eagles are often found feeding peaceably in the midst of the numerous yellow-billed kite (&quot;Milvus aegyptius&quot;) on termites. However, when interactions are of a more competitive nature, the steppe eagle tends to dominate any species of kite. Other raptors both large and small are not infrequently the victims of kleptoparasitism by steppe eagles. In India, Brahminy kites (&quot;Haliastur indus&quot;), black kites (&quot;Milvus migrans&quot;), laggar falcons (&quot;Falco juggar&quot;), Montagu&#x27;s harrier (&quot;Circus pygargus&quot;) and western marsh harriers (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot;) among others were robbed of their catches as well as spotted and even tawny eagles. However, house crows (&quot;Corvus splendens&quot;) often robbed the steppe eagles. In Armenia, common buzzards and Montagu&#x27;s harriers were seen to be robbed of catches by steppe eagles. Even the golden eagle has seen to have its prey be stolen by steppe eagles in the Bale Mountains.

Predatory interactions with other carnivorous animals where the steppe eagles are victims are largely restricted to the vulnerable young, with the nest sites often being highly vulnerable due to their often accessible positions on mildly elevated ground. Hungry canids are often particularly detrimental predators, particularly grey wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) and dogs (often herding and feral ones) and more infrequently red foxes and other carnivores like cats and their kin. An unexpected source of steppe eagle nestling mortality was found to be from the unusually aggressive pallid harrier (&quot;Circus macrourus&quot;) which attacked and killed two consecutive young eagles although never fed on them (possibly due to delayed displacement by the parent eagles). Apart from the vulnerable young on the nesting ground, steppe eagles appear to be seldom killed by natural predators. However, one was reported as the victim of a caracal (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;) in Saudi Arabia (probably in a nighttime ambush). More often, the steppe eagle is the predator rather than victim in deadly contests against other predators. Besides the many aforementioned accounts of prey including carnivores like mustelids and foxes, steppe eagles can also on occasion kill other raptorial birds and seems to consider even quite formidable species as viable prey. In the Karaganda region alone, the local steppe eagles were recorded to prey on lesser kestrels (&quot;Falco naumanni&quot;), long-legged buzzards, Eurasian eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) and seven short-eared owls (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;). In the Altai region, in addition to eagle-owls, the black kite has also been recorded as steppe eagle prey. In fact, the steppe eagle apparently is the only bird to have preyed upon Eurasian eagle-owls besides the golden eagle on multiple occasions. Although rarely observed to halt movements or to eat while migrating in Israel, one steppe eagle was seen to suddenly strike down and consume an adult common buzzard while both species were in passage there. A Brahminy kite that was seen attempting to mob a steppe eagle in Tamil Nadu was observed to be killed by the eagle, while at least one other Brahminy there was also injured by an aggressive steppe eagle.

==Breeding==

The steppe eagle, like most raptors, breeds in pairs. Otherwise, it displays a preference for solitude whilst summering on the steppe. Like other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles, this species may engage in a territorial aerial display. The display of the steppe eagle is not well-known but can be assumed to resemble that of sympatric eagles and is known to include high circling (but perhaps engage in less aerial acrobatics than other &quot;Aquila&quot;). In Kalmykia, the mean number of pairs per was 1.7. The steppe eagle is rare in the Saratov area, with peak areas such as Alexandrovo-Gaysky District, Novouzensky District, Saint Petersburg and Ozinsky District hold a mean of about 3 pairs per while elsewhere in Saratov, the mean number of pairs per that area is about 0.8. Nearest neighbor distance in Transbaikal averaged . 85 nests in the Altai foothills were found to distanced at a mean of although not all of the nests were occupied. In the Ukok Plateau (within the Altais), the mean nearest neighbor distance was found to be , ranging from . Another study of the Altai found that there were about 0.51 to 3.11 pairs per with a number of successful pairs of 0.35–1.35 per this area, and further more found that Khakassia and Krasnoyarsk Krai contained higher nesting densities but that the Tvya Republic contained lowered densities. This study found that in Altai that the mean nearest neighbor distance was on average , ranging from . In the borderlands between Kazakhstan and Russia, i.e. Aktobe and Orenburg, there was an estimated 7.1 pairs per . In the southern part of the Aktobe region, such as between Bayganin District and Miyaly, the density of nesting steppes can occasionally reach as high as 2-2.5 pairs per . In the Atyrau Region of Kazakhstan, nests on utility towers were spaced at a mean of around as opposed to around apart on other nesting substrates. In the Aral and Caspian areas of Kazakhstan, the mean nearest neighbor distance was but the density of breeding pairs varied more than 50 fold based on habitat, with locally cliff habitat being the least productive and clay semi-desert the most productive. Within the Karaganda Region, the mean number of pairs per was 7.67 while the numbers of successful pairs per such an area was 3.24. In Xinjiang, home ranges were found to range in size from . The breeding season falls from late March or early April (occasionally not starting in earnest until late April) to roughly late August, although several steppe eagles can remain on their breeding grounds until at least October.

===Nests===

The nest is a large stick platform, varying greater in size based on available materials but averaging flatter than those of other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles, excepting the tawny eagle. Most nests are around in diameter and around deep. Nests in the Transbaikal averaged across with nests located on cliffs or rocks getting larger at up to deep. In the Sarastov area, 14 nests measured on average in diameter by in depth, with ranges of and , respectively. Nests in Xinjiang could diameters of as much as . The largest nest in the southern Aktobe region reached a diameter of ; while height of the nest could vary there from those in trees could reach up to . The nest is generally lined with twigs and much clutter. This is due to sparser nesting material in their habitat, so nest structures frequently include peculiar items: paper, polyethylene bags, pieces of wool and manure, bones, feathers, old rags and other human refuse. The nest is traditionally place in an exposed site among stones, often on a hummock. Other nesting sites can include very low bushes and a spot on the ground which is usually raised slightly above the mean layout of the environment. Some other nest sites are known have including haystacks or ruins for a slight prominence, also sometimes on a non-steep cliff or rarely in a tree. Although some older studies claimed that steppe eagles avoided nesting near human activity this has been largely disproven. In Kalmykia, all nests were only from paved roads. A nest in the West Kazakhstan Region was found to be quite close to a village. However, in Transbaikal, the conversion of areas to farmland was a primary cause of a large population contraction for the eagles there. Of 14 nests in Kalmykia, 10 were located on the ground and 4 were in trees or shrubs, not to mention some located on transmission towers at a mean nest height of . In Transbaikal, 53.7% of 47 nests were on hills. Those located on rocky outcrops in Transbaikal, averaged above the mean ground level. In the region of Lake Baskunchak, most of 16 nests found for the species were on rocky rubble and boulders, karst craters and cliffs, with two located on trees. In the Altai region, 62.4% of territories contained only one nest but 27.4% contained 1 alternate nests, 4.7% contained 2 alternate nests and 5.9% contained 3 alternate nests. A study in Altai determined that nests were often in virgin or fallow steppe near larch forests, and were often reused in subsequent years. The location of Altai nests were on gently sloping rocky outcrops, or cuesta escarpments, mostly, which were about 82% of known nest sites (with only 4% on flat ground) In the borderlands of Kazakhstan and Russia, of 418 total nests, 75.6% of nests were on ledges of rocks and boulders or quartz ridges and only 15.8% were on flat ground. Within the region of Atyrau in Kazakhstan, 26% of raptor nests located on electrical transmission towers (or pylons) were those of steppe eagles. 38% of nests in the Aral-Caspian region were either on pylons or at the base of them. In the Karaganda Region, 75.6% of nests were on outcrops and a further 10.84% were on rock disintegrations, and all nest sites had a rocky substrate (including a very small amount on low bushes as well). The Karaganda nests were at a mean elevation of . In the general West Kazakhstan Region, of 286 nests 30.42% were on ground or rocks, 28.32% in trees or bushes and 27.27% on utility poles. The nests in the West Kazakh area that were on rocks and cliffs averaged above the ground, those on poles averaged above ground, in trees and those in bushes averaged above the ground. One nest near the Ili River was noted to be a small tree, &quot;Haloxylon&quot;, while another was a perhaps dangerously hot sandy dune. One successful nest near the Irtysh River was on the shrub Iberian meadowsweet (&quot;Spiraea hypericfolia&quot;) (while another unsuccessful one was on a thick growth of &quot;Lonicera tatarica&quot;). Another unusual Kazakh nest was on the ground with rather loamy grasslands that was probably unsafe due to excessive sun exposure (only blocked for 20% of the day) and a considerable local presence of red foxes. Of 49 nests found in Mongolia 47.8% were on the ground, 32.6% were on rock columns or large boulders, 8.7% on cliffs, 8.7% on artificial substrates, including a car tire, an abandoned car cabin and an artificial nest platform and 2.2% was in a tree. All Mongolian nest in this study were at elevations between , with a mean of . In Mongolia, the height of nests above the surrounding flat earth was .

===Eggs and incubation===

The clutch size is usually 2, i.e. from 1 to 3 with some clutches very rarely including as many as 4–5 eggs. The clutch averaged 2.38 in nests in the Aral-Caspian area. In Kalmykia, the mean clutch size was 2.31. In the Lake Baskunchak area, 66.7% of nests contained 2 eggs, 25% contained 3 and 8.3% contained 1. Out of 30 inhabited nests in the Transbaikal, 77% had 2 eggs, 20% had 1 egg and 3% had 3 eggs. In the Volga area, the average clutch size was 2.2. One study in Altai found the clutch size of a small sample averaged 1.67, while another placed the mean clutch size of 19 clutches was 2. Yet another Altai study found that clutch size in 32 active nests was 2.33. In Aktobe and Orenburg, the mean clutch size was 1.94. In western Kazakhstan, the clutch size average was 2.38, with up to 4 recorded; here 54.05% of clutches contained 2 eggs. The mean clutch size in study in Mongolia was 1.9, amongst 43 egg-laying pairs, 58.1% laid 2 eggs, 23.3% laid 1 and 18.6% laid 3. The eggs are largely off-white in colour but may have faint brown or grey spots. The mean egg size in Kalmykia was with a range of in height and a range of in width. The average was similar in the Volga area, at , with ranges of by . Eggs were larger in Transbaikal where they measured on average and weighed a mean of . Two eggs in Altai weighed , respectively. The incubation stage lasts around 45 days, though may be up to week briefer in some cases. Hatching is often sometime in May, but can continue to early June.

===Development of young and parental behaviour===

The brood size in Kalmykia averaged 1.64. As for Transbaikal, the average number of chick per occupied nest was 0.65 while, in the successful nests, the average was 1.38. In the Altai, the mean brood size was reported as 2 in a sample of 9 one year and 1.4 in a sample of 10 the next year. A different study of the Altai found that there was a mean brood size of 1.86 per successful nest (0.86 per all occupied nests). In the trans-border of Russia and Kazakhstan, the mean brood size per occupied nest was 1.03. The average brood size in the Aral-Caspian was 2.36. In the highlands of the East Kazakhstan Region, a mean of 1.9 eaglets were found in 15 occupied nests. In the west Kazakh region, the brood size average was 2.22. One study found that sex can be identified via morphometric measurements in 90% of cases and that the larger eastern populations of steppe eagle are conspicuously larger at all stages of development than the more westerly ones. The growth and development of a single chick in the Zhanybek District of Kazakhstan was well studied, in an area where little ground squirrels were broadly available (i.e. about 40 adults per ha). This eaglet weighed and was covered in white down on day 1 while, by day 6, it weighed and had down white as earlier but longer. By day 10, it weighed and by day 15 weighed . At the age of 20 days, this eaglet weighed and manifest much more conspicuous emerging brown feathers. Once aged 25 days, it weighed and had juvenile feathers over a third of its body and by day 30 it weighed . By day 35, it weighed and was almost all brown but with down still about the head. Full body size and juvenile plumage (but for fully-developed wing and tail feathers) was attained at 40–43 days for the chick, it weighed ; although fully grown, it still crouched down at threats and could not fly. Similar growth was tracked in Xinjiang, where it was noted that around 20 days of age, the young could standing, wing flap frequently at 45 days and move about the nest vicinity somewhat and could at 60 days old eat unaided. In one case near the Irtysh River, when a nest was approached by humans, the eldest eaglet was seen to aggressively display and try to displace them while it appeared to protect its two young siblings, which sheltered behind it. The fledging of the young eagles occurs relatively quickly at somewhere between 55 and 65 days, due probably to the vulnerability of the nest sites, quickly leaving the nest is probably advantages to avoid dangers peculiar to these eagles nest like predators, wildfires, cattle-trampling, humans and so on. Usually, the second fledgling initially flies somewhat later and more clumsily than the first. The difference in fledgling times from the first to the second fledgling was recorded to be 8 to 10 days in Transbaikal. The mother steppe eagle in Kalmykia is not as tight a sitter as other &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles tend to be and flushed when approached within and may too take a relatively long time to return. However, here the females were highly tolerant of automobiles. Along the Irtysh River in Kazakhstan, although steppe eagles flushed when approached within they did not depart for long and returned quickly for this species relative to other reports. Those nesting in Atyrau on utility towers allowed approach to within via car. In the southern Aktobe region, the steppe eagles appear almost desensitized to humans, probably due to extensive exposure unlike in more remote areas, and allowed approach via motorcycle to within but flushed if a person was on foot within . Levels of hemoparasites appear to be low in nestling steppe eagles but the sample sizes of the only study known so far are small.

===Nesting success rates===
Out of 10 nests in two locations in Kalmykia, alarmingly, 7 contained dead embryos that never hatched. Thus, the breeding success rate here was quite low at 30–40%. Study from the Altai region determined that than occupied nests produced an average of 1.52 fledglings. Within the Ukok Plateau part of the Altais, 31.6% of 19 checked nests were found to be successful. The mean number of fledglings in Mongolia per nest was 0.9 with a fledgling success rate of 42.2%, with no strong annual variations. Nest located on cliffs were more successful in Mongolia, the reasons inferred were greater protection from the elements and from predators, while for those nesting on artificial substrates, the success rate was lower (37.5%). Of 30 failures recorded in Mongolia, 37.5% were due to desertion by the parents, 16.7% due to infertile eggs, 6.7% due to predation (possibly from wolves and common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;)), 10% due to starvation, 3.3% from cannibalism and the remaining 26.7% from unknown causes. In the Lake Baskunchak area, several nests were abandoned due to reportedly accidental human intrusions. Study in Xinjiang indicated that about two-thirds of nesting attempts by steppe eagles there appear to fail. In Tuva, the dictating factors of nesting success were considered habitat quality, food supply, disturbance levels, and the ability to rapidly change home ranges as habitats were unnaturally altered via the felling of tall trees. Starvation and dehydration seem to be leading causes of chick mortality in Lake Baskunchak. In the Orenburg region, 41.1% of nestling mortality was due to starvation (after a decline of the little ground squirrel), 38.3% due to steppe fires, human disturbance at just under 10% and more minor causes were parental inexperience and predation. Among active nests in the Karaganda Region, as of 2017, 42.26% were successful and a high rate of 54.46% completely failed, producing 0.61 fledglings per occupied nest and 1.45 per successful nest. Many Karaganda nests were noted to include infertile eggs, while many nests were destroyed in steppe fires. A follow-up study 2 years later found even more severe nest failure rates, with only 28.42% of nests succeeding. The reduction of the number of occupied nests here was 18.9% and by number of successful nests, the reduction was 63.9%. The breeding of a large quantity of visibly younger eagles in a breeding population is generally thought to indicate stress on the population of a raptor species. The steppe eagle, in sync with its overall decline, has shown an alarming increase of subadult specimens breeding. In Kalmykia, the number of breeding subadults increased from 1.75% prior to 5.26% during the 2011–2015 period. This is a relatively small amount of breeding underaged eagles compared to some other populations. In the Aral and Caspian areas, 39.62% of 58 breeding pairs contained 1 subadult breeding bird of around 3–5 years of age. Similarly, within the Ukok Plateau, only 23.8% of 67 sighted steppe eagle were mature adults, indicating the reduction of mature individuals is similarly severe there. Subadult breeding steppe eagles were also noticed in Mongolia.

==Status==
Densities of steppe eagles vary greatly both regionally and annually. This species has specialized food requirements, making this species more dependent on food availability than many other raptors. European Russia in the 1990s was estimated to hold up to 20,000 pairs while steppe eagles were considered very rare in some parts of breeding range (i.e. central-south Siberia). Even in recent decades, the steppe eagle has been considered easily one of the most numerous migrating eagles in the world. The species has largely been regarded as &quot;widespread and common&quot; in winter in Indian subcontinent. Estimates of the world population were projected based on the total breeding range encompasses over and average density very roughly of , which would put the population would be in six figures, but density were perceived to be slightly lower (i.e. 1 pair/) gives a total of 80,000 breeding pairs. A refined and more recent estimate of the global population posited that there were 53,000–86,000 remaining breeding pairs globally for steppe eagles, with 43,000–59,000 pairs estimated in Kazakhstan, 2000–3000 estimated in Russia, 6000–13,000 estimated in Mongolia, and 2000–6000 estimated in China. This study projects the global number to be between 185,000 and 344,000 individuals at peak times, which is the end of the breeding season, with only 17,700–43,000 remaining adults. The Aral-Caspian area is estimated to hold about 5742–7548 breeding pairs (51% of which are thought to breed in Uzbekistan, the remainder in Kazakhstan). Post-breeding, the Aral-Caspian is thought to hold about 10,000–14,000 individuals. It is thought that the West Kazakhstan Region and Kalmykia region are the epicenter of the world population, holding the maximum genetic diversity (via haplotype) in the world, with the genetic diversity narrowing farther east in the breeding range. The Altai and Sayan region is thought to hold 43–51% of the current breeding population of steppe eagles in Russia, with the Altai Republic estimated to hold 270–280 breeding pairs. A slight recovery has been noted in the Tuva Basin, going up to as much as 200–300 pairs between 2008 and 2014. 

The breeding range of the steppe eagle was already contracted markedly early on in the 20th century, especially in the west, largely as result of habitat loss (in particular appropriation of steppes for agriculture) but also persecution and predation, factors that may have driven some pairs to elevated nest sites. Steppe eagles once bred in Romania, Moldova and, more recently, Ukraine. Careless pesticide use in Europe depleted prey populations and collapsed nearly the whole local ecosystem, which alongside habitat conversions and persecution drove the steppe eagle&#x27;s European breeding population to extinction. Range contraction is very considerable today in the European Russia area where it is almost locally extinct as well. Declines overall have been rapid and alarming. It is estimated that as of the 20 years prior to 2015, the population worldwide has declined at minimum by 58.6%. As a result, the steppe eagle was uplisted in 2015 to being endangered by the IUCN. In the borderlands of Russia and Kazakhstan, an estimated 11.9% population decline was detected in merely 6 years of study. Primary global threats appear to be habitat loss, persecution, wildfires, predation (and trampling by cattle) of chicks and electrocutions and wire collisions, especially the latter causes. Furthermore, the steppe eagles genetic diversity may be rapidly declining as well. The diagnosed causes of decline in Xinjiang, Tibet and Qinghai were found mostly to be poaching, poisoning from rodent control programs (with systemic efforts dating back at least 60 years), poisoning also targeted towards predators, illegal trade, food shortages and wire collisions but perhaps most of all habitat destruction, often with their former homes destroyed to make way for roadworks, tourism and mine exploration, with more destruction from overharvest of trees and plants and overgrazing by livestock, and accidental are frequent. Poisoning is thought to be quite prevalent in the Altais, as well as powerline electrocutions. A mean of 13.3 individual steppe eagles in Kazakhstan were estimated to be killed by each of powerline. The steppe eagle can even been the most frequently electrocuted raptor in Kazakh data, at up to about 35% of 129 dead raptors or 49% of 223 dead raptors in a couple of relatively small stretches. Many birds of various families are killed by these powerlines, as was recorded in Central Kazakhstan, in addition to the various raptorial birds which (due to their low reproductive rates and large territories) are often unable to withstand continuous powerline losses. It is estimated that in West Kazakhstan that no fewer than 1635 nests (or 7.9% of the entire breeding Kazakh population) fail due to the parents being electrocuted on powerlines. Across the border in Orenburg, Russia, a high rate of electrocutions is known be occurring as well. Furthermore, overgrazing and habitat alterations by humans have destroyed much of what remains around &quot;Haloxylon&quot; stands of west Kazakhstan (in turn destroying about 50% of local nesting attempts), while some steppe eagles cannot nest locally due to presumed competitive exclusion by imperial eagles. Locally predation and nest losses can claim up to 80% of chicks but productivity is heavily dependent on foods. In the Karaganda Region, 20.9% of nests were recorded to be ruined by steppe fires. Less well understood losses in West Kazakhstan may be due to continued poaching, poisonings and blackflies which kill nestlings and seem to have increased with the warming temperatures. The number of steppe fires appears to be higher than ever before which also may be due to increasing warmth and aridity. The probable and irrevocable extinction of this species is projected if numerous detrimental factors are not reversed, namely the mitigation of electrical lines and towers in breeding areas, the removal of grazing and manmade fires in breeding areas as well as habitat destruction and the several other threats. Ambiguities exist over whether Kazakhstan can institute protective laws strong enough to prevent the loss of the species, as even powerline alterations have not occurred at the national level. However, continued relative stability of the species has been detected in the more minor eastern part of the range (based on largely unchanged numbers of migrants from here in Nepal and elsewhere in the Himalayas) such as Altai. One potential stopgap solution to mitigate some of the electrocutions may be to install T-shaped perches around transmission towers which has been effective in reducing the more minor decline from powerlines in the Mongolian part of the range. Notably, the rate of decline in the western part of the range is so pronounced which is quite to the contrary other similar raptors like eastern imperial eagles and long-legged buzzards have begun to recover in similar areas (the opposite pattern almost manifests in the imperial eagle, which is declining much more severely in the east such as Baikal).
The nomadic nature of steppe eagles in winter can make accurate counts of the species in that season difficult. However, the species is still considered relatively frequent during winter in Pakistan. Declines from migrating and wintering areas appear to be generally poorly documented. There is concern that landfills function as ecological traps for these species, due to poisoning being frequent and powerlines frequently a present threat. From the years 1882 to 2013, an estimated 76,879 steppes were recorded in 9 countries in Indian subcontinent, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, Sikkim, Myanmar and Bangladesh, often gathering around garbage and carrion dumps. They may be even locally increasing somewhat in number in locales in India such as Kerala, possibly concentrated more so due to less competition from vultures. However, toxic levels of diclofenac were found in two dead steppe eagles at the cattle carcass dump in Rajasthan. A paper based on joint research conducted by the Bombay Natural History Society, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Indian Veterinary Research Institute, published in May 2014 in the journal of the Cambridge University Press, highlighted that steppe eagles are adversely affected by diclofenac and may fall prey to veterinary use of it. The research found the same signs of kidney failure as seen in the &quot;Gyps&quot; vulture killed due to diclofenac. They found extensive visceral gout, lesions and uric acid deposits in the liver, kidney and spleen, as well as deposits of diclofenac residue in tissues. Steppe eagles are opportunistic scavengers, which may expose them to the risk of diclofenac poisoning. Declines have pronounced in passage at Eilat, Israel, where the number of steppe eagle juveniles to adult has dropped 30% from the early 1980s and by 1.4% by 2000; all record low annual numbers in migration there have been subsequent to the 1990s. However, lower numbers in Eilat may be due in part to increasingly large portions of the steppe eagle population now wintering in Arabia rather than Africa. Persecution of raptors in Eilat appears to be still quite prevalent, with steppe eagles accounting for 9.1% of 77 raptors that were found killed by poachers (often appeared to been wrapped in rope and sometimes mutilated), doing so apparently largely out of superstition. Some population declines of migrants in Israel may too have depleted as well by the Chernobyl disaster. Israeli biologist have strongly advocated that stricter protection be undertaken and a conserved greenbelt be instituted to accommodate the steppe eagle and other raptors in passage. The similar numbers seen in passage exiting Africa in spring as those entering in autumn indicate that mortality for the species is not high in that continent. Persecution through shooting likely continues to be of determent to steppe eagles migrating or wintering in the countries of Georgia, Armenia, Iraq and Jordan, with the eagles being relatively vulnerable due to their sluggish, unwary demeanor and, in Iraq, along with many raptors end up being offered at local markets. In Saudi Arabia, the turnover to more intensive farming activity has depleted to available habitat usable for steppe eagles. In Saudi Arabia as well as Iraq and Armenia, other conservation concerns are similar as elsewhere, including dangerous powerlines and potential poisonings.

<text>Beverly is the 72nd of Chicago&#x27;s 77 community areas. Located from the Loop, it is on the city&#x27;s far south side. Beverly is considered part of the Blue Island Ridge, along with the nearby community areas of Morgan Park and Mount Greenwood, and Washington Heights, and the City of Blue Island. , Beverly had 20,027 inhabitants.

Sparsely settled until the late 19th century, Beverly was incorporated as part of the Village of Washington Heights in 1874 and began development by business interests from Chicago. The area was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1890 and continued to grow with the completion in the Rock Island Railroad that runs parallel along the eastern edge of the Blue Island ridge to its terminus at LaSalle Street Station in downtown Chicago. Beverly&#x27;s situation along on the ridge allowed the community to become an exclusive streetcar community, which is reflected in the homes and large lots.

==History==
===Etymology===
In 1889, when the Rock Island Railroad realigned its suburban tracks, it expanded service north of 99th Street. The new station on 91st Street was named &quot;91st Street–Beverly Hills station&quot;. By the late 1910s, the telephone network established a Beverly exchange. The exact significance of the name &quot;Beverly Hills&quot; is no longer known. Many speculate it is named after Beverly, Massachusetts, at the suggestion of Alice Helm French, a prominent resident and wife of the first director of the Art Institute of Chicago, or that the Rock Island Railroad simply named it after the hilly terrain. It is not named after Beverly Hills, California, which was named after the city in Massachusetts and received its name nearly 20 years after the 91st Street Station was named.

===19th century===
Beverly and the surrounding area was sparsely populated by the Potawatomi and some white settlers until 1833, when the indigenous people forcibly ceded their land rights to the United States under Indian removal. The earliest known non-indigenous inhabitants of the area were DeWitt Lane, who settled near 103rd Street and Seeley Avenue in 1832, and Norman Rexford, who opened a tavern near 91st Street and Pleasant Avenue. The area famously became a dry settlement, prohibiting saloons and the sale of liquor. A permanent settlement was established with the sale of the land to John Blackstone in 1839. In 1844, Blackstone sold the land along the Blue Island Ridge from 91st to 115th Streets to Thomas Morgan, after whom Morgan Park is named.

The transformation of the area to a suburban community began in 1869 when the descendants of Thomas Morgan sold his lands to the Blue Island Land and Building Company. The area, which was at the intersection of the Rock Island Railroad and the Panhandle Route, saw a substantial period of growth sustained by Chicagoans displaced by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. It became an attractive community with the establishment of several schools in the 1870s. In 1874, much of Beverly and the area to the east was incorporated as the Village of Washington Heights. In 1890, the section of modern-day Beverly north of 95th Street was annexed to the City of Chicago. The section west of Western Avenue and south of 99th Street was added to Washington Heights.

==Geography==
Beverly Hills is community area #72. It is on Chicago&#x27;s far south side, from the Loop. Its northern border is 87th Street and its southern border is 107th Street. Its western border runs along Western Avenue from the northern border to 99th Street, then along Fairfield Avenue to 103rd Street, and finally along the rail line to the southern border. Its eastern border runs along Vincennes Avenue from 107th to 103rd Street, then along Beverly Avenue up to the northern border. The community covers an area of . Beverly is connected to the Interstate system via I-57, located immediately to the east.

Beverly, Morgan Park, Mount Greenwood, Washington Heights, and the City of Blue Island are considered part of the Blue Island Ridge. The prehistoric glacial ridge was once an island in a lake and later part of its western shore. The distinct geological history is the most significant in Chicago, being the point of highest elevation at nearly above the water line of Lake Michigan. It was named for its color, due to atmospheric conditions or its blue wildflowers. 51.3% of the total is used for single-family housing, 2.9% for multifamily housing, 3.2% for commercial development, less than 0.1% for industrial development, 2.1% for institutional development, 0.5% for mixed-use development, and 13% is vacant lots or open space. The remaining 26.9% was defined as &quot;transportation and other&quot;.

 over three-quarters of the housing stock, 78.7%, in Beverly consists of single-family detached homes, compared to 26.1% citywide. Most of the houses were built before 1969 (45.4% between 1940 and 1969 and 46.3% before 1940). The median number of rooms in an area house is 7.4, compared to 4.8 rooms citywide. About 92% of the housing units were occupied. Of the total number of units, 85.3% were owner-occupied and 14.7% were renter-occupied. No multifamily buildings in the area were considered affordable according to a study conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

==Demographics==
Prior to European American settlement, the area was home to Potawatomi people, who in 1833, after the Black Hawk War, were forcibly moved west of the Mississippi River by the federal government. Beverly&#x27;s early Caucasian settlement was largely English and Protestant, but by the early 20th century, a large influx of Irish Americans began to arrive in the neighborhood and the construction of several Roman Catholic church parishes and business establishments saw Beverly develop into a stronghold of the city&#x27;s South Side Irish community.

 20,027 people in 7,691 households lived in Beverly. This represents a decrease of less than 0.1% from the 2010 U.S. census, which in turn had represented a 8.9% decline from the 2000 U.S. census. The area&#x27;s racial composition was 55.3% White, 32.4% Black, 1.3% Asian and 3.7% other racial categories. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 7.2% of the population. Along with being known for its Irish American community identity, Beverly is also known for being one of the most racially integrated neighborhoods in Chicago with one of the city&#x27;s highest percentage of black residents among white-majority neighborhoods. The age range was broad, with 23.6% under the age of 19, 15.4% aged 20 to 34, 16.7% aged 35 to 49, 25.6% aged 50 to 64, 12.2% aged 65 to 74, 5.0% 75 to 84, and 1.5% 85 and older. The median age was 45, compared to 35.1 citywide. English was the only language spoken by 92.0% of the population aged five and older, compared to a citywide figure of 64.8%.

The median household income was $113,824 , compared to the citywide median income of $65,781. Seven percent of households earned less than $25,000 annually; 11.3% earned between $25,000 and $49,999; 11.6% earned between $50,000 and $74,999; 13.1% earned between $75,000 and $99,999; 20.7% earned between $100,000 and $149,999, and 36.3% earned more than $150,000. This compares with a citywide distribution of 21.8%, 18.4%, 14.9%, 11.7%, 14.7% and 18.6%, respectively. , the western census tracts in the area had a median household income of over $86,900; the eastern tracts had a median household income between $57,900 and $86,900. The entire area placed above the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s low-income limit.

The hardship index is a metric used by the City of Chicago which considers six indicators of public health to quantify the relative amount of hardship in a community area: the percentage of occupied housing units with more than one person per room; the percentage of households living below the federal poverty level; the percentage of persons in the labor force over the age of 16 years that are unemployed; the percentage of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school diploma; the percentage of the population under 18 or over 64 years of age; and per capita income. The index is represented as a score from 1 to 100, with a higher score indicating greater hardship. , Beverly&#x27;s hardship index was 12.

==Economy and employment==
 66.3% of Beverly&#x27;s population was in the labor force; the unemployment rate was 7.6%, compared to the citywide rate of 8.4%.

The next two major industries of employment were health care (13.4%) and public administration (12.5%). Within the community area, transportation, professional employment, accommodation and food service, retail trade, and health care were the top five employer industries, accounting for 18.9%, 17.9%, 11.9%, 10.1%, and 9.0%, respectively.

==Parks and recreation==
Several of the parks within Beverly were once part of the Ridge Park District, one of 22 independent park districts in Chicago before their amalgamation in 1934 into the Chicago Park District. Beverly contains 2.0 accessible park acres (0.81 ha) per 1,000 residents, compared to a citywide figure of . The area includes Barnard, Ridge, Hurley, Cosme, Graver, Munroe, Beverly, Ridge Wetlands, and King-Lockhart parks.

Barnard Park was created after Erastus A. Barnard donated of land to be named in honor of his deceased daughter Amy. Alice L. Barnard, a local teacher and historian and Amy&#x27;s aunt, had recently been honored with the renaming of a nearby school. The park contains a playground and open space for sports and picnicing.

Ridge Park, named after the tree-studded ridge that lines the western border of the property, is a park established in 1908. The outdoor space contains three baseball diamonds, a playground, tennis courts, and a walking path. It also contains a set of war memorials. The park&#x27;s fieldhouse was constructed in 1913 expanded in the late 1920s. It features a gymnasium, auditorium, indoor swimming pool, fitness center, woodshop, and multi-purpose rooms. The fieldhouse is also home to the Vanderpoel Memorial Art gallery, a collection of approximately 500 works by American painters and sculptors.

Hurley Park is a park established in 1923 at the petition of local residents. In 1984, the park was named after Father Timothy Hurley, the founder of the St. Barnabas Catholic parish located one block south of the park. The park contains a playground at the bottom of its hill and a nature preserve at the top.

Cosme Park is a park established in 1927 at the persuasion of the Beverly Hills Improvement Association. In the early 1990s, it was named in memory of Margaret Cosme, a young girl who tragically died after being struck by a moving vehicle. Her father and grandfather helped construct the park&#x27;s baseball diamond in the years before her death. The park also features a playground and tennis courts.

Graver Park is a park that was acquired and constructed throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s. The park&#x27;s fieldhouse contains an auditorium, science lab, woodshop, and a multi-purpose room. Outside, the park offers a water park; tennis courts; a playground; and softball, baseball, and soccer fields. It was named after Philip S.

These facilities are separated by large meadow expanses. Within the park is a memorial dedicated to Cpl. Conner T. Lowry, who died during combat in Afghanistan. Before his death in 2012, he asked his mother to memorialize him at Beverly Park should he not survive. On the first anniversary of his death, Mayor Rahm Emanuel dedicated the bronze statue of marine&#x27;s boots, a rifle, and helmet. The 10200 block of South Maplewood Avenue adjacent to the park was designated Honorary Cpl. Conner T. Lowry way.

Located less than a block away from Ridge Park, Ridge Wetlands Park was purchased from Metra in 1991 in order to save the wooded wetlands from being paved over for parking space. It totals .

King-Lockhart Park is a park and plaza located at 10609 South Western Avenue. It is the former site of the Beverly Tire Store, which was destroyed in a fire on February 11, 1998.

The park is named after Chicago firefighters Patrick King and Anthony Lockhart, who died while battling the fire. Two pergolas mark the locations where each firefighter died.

==Landmarks==

* Givins Beverly Castle (also known as the Givins Irish Castle): Arguably the most notable architectural feature in Beverly, the castle is located at the corner of 103rd Street and Longwood Drive. Robert C. Givins directed its construction in 1886 and 1887, inspired by castles from his native Ireland. He used it as his private residence until 1894. The three-story castle with its three crenellated towers has been extensively renovated over its history, though the iconic outer shell has remained unchanged. The Beverly Unitarian Church is the fifth and current &quot;keeper&quot;. The castle is the only building of its kind in Chicago and is commonly claimed to be haunted.
* Beverly/Morgan Railroad District: This historic district is a set of six train stations: the 91st Street, 95th Street, 99th Street, 107th Street, 111th Street and 115th Street. Of the six, the first four are located within Beverly. These stations, which were collectively constructed between 1889 and 1945, represent rare examples of late 19th to early 20th century train station architecture in Chicago. They were designated a Chicago Landmark on April 15, 1995.
* Longwood Drive District: The houses along Longwood Drive atop the iconic hill were built beginning in 1873 by various architects. Longwood was named for a long copse of trees that ran along the lee side of the hill where the rest of Beverly is located. Some of the community&#x27;s grandest houses line the street, as it was a lofty overview for wealthy Chicagoans looking to build homes in a rural area. The houses along the street represent a mixture of different styles of architecture, such as Italianate, Carpenter Gothic, Queen Anne, Shingle, Prairie School, and Renaissance Revival. The district was designated a Chicago Landmark on November 13, 1981.

* Guy C. Smith and H. Howard Hyde Houses: These two houses are a set of American System-Built Homes located at 10410 and 10541 South Hoyne Avenue, respectively. They were constructed in 1917 and designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The first house was intended to be the first of a subdivision of homes. Both houses are two-story, single-family units. They were designated a Chicago Landmark on July 13, 1994.
* William and Jessie M. Adams House: The William and Jessie M. Adams House is a Prairie school style house located at 9326 South Pleasant Avenue. The squarish two-story structure was built between 1900 and 1901 by Frank Lloyd Wright. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 16, 1994. In March 2014, the house sold for $980,000 after being owned by the same family since 1952.
* Walter Burley Griffin Place District: The district is an area along the 1600–1800 blocks of West Griffin Place containing homes built between 1909 and 1914. Seven of the homes (numbers 1666, 1712, 1724, 1727, 1731, 1736, and 1741) were built by Walter Burley Griffin, one by Spencer and Powers, and the rest by various architects.

<text>U.S. Route 99 (US 99) was a main north–south United States Numbered Highway on the West Coast of the United States until 1964, running from Calexico, California, on the Mexican border to Blaine, Washington, on the Canadian border. It was assigned in 1926 and existed until it was replaced for the most part by Interstate 5. Known also as the &quot;Golden State Highway&quot; and &quot;The Main Street of California&quot;, US 99 was important throughout much of the 1930s as a route for Dust Bowl immigrant farm workers to traverse the state. Large portions are now California State Route 99 (SR 99), Oregon&#x27;s Routes 99, 99W, and 99E, and Washington&#x27;s SR 99. The highway in Washington connected to British Columbia Highway 99, whose number was derived from that of US 99, at the Canada–US border.

==Route description==
===California===

The basic former route of U.S. Route 99 in California started at the Mexico–United States border in Calexico, and then ran north through the Imperial Valley and along the western shore of the Salton Sea to the Coachella Valley (roughly present-day California State Route 86 and California State Route 111). US 99 then headed west to Los Angeles (present-day Interstate 10), and then north again to the Central Valley (present-day Interstate 5). US 99 then continued along the present-day corridor of California State Route 99 to Bakersfield, Fresno, and Sacramento. In Sacramento, the highway split into two suffixed routes, 99W and 99E. US 99W roughly followed the route of present-day Interstate 5 on the western side of the Sacramento Valley, and US 99E followed present-day State Route 99 on the eastern side of the valley. Both highways merged back together in Red Bluff, and US 99 continued along the present-day Interstate 5 corridor to the Oregon border.

===Oregon===

The former route of U.S. Route 99 in Oregon mostly follows routes currently signed as Oregon Route 99, 99E, and 99W. The primary exception is from the California–Oregon state border north to Ashland, Oregon, where U.S. 99 is currently designated as Oregon Route 273 from the state border to Exit 6 of Interstate 5. The former route is coterminous with Interstate 5 from Exit 6 to the junction of Oregon Route 99 in Ashland.

===Washington===
Unlike in California and Oregon, much of the former route of U.S. Highway 99 in Washington exists as local roads and regular city streets; only the route from Fife to Everett still retains the same number as State Route 99. US 99 went through two stages of redevelopment in Washington. The first was a general replacement of the original two-lane highway with a four-lane limited-access highway. At that time, the limited-access highway was badged as US 99, and any parallel original route was generally known as &quot;old 99&quot;. The second phase was the development of an Interstate Highway, much of which followed the new 99 route and is known as I-5.

==History==

An extensive section of this highway (over ), from approximately Stockton, California to Vancouver, Washington, follows very closely the track of the Siskiyou Trail. The Siskiyou Trail was based on an ancient network of Native American Indian footpaths connecting the Pacific Northwest with California&#x27;s Central Valley. By the 1820s, trappers from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were the first non-Native Americans to use the route of U.S. Highway 99 to move between today&#x27;s Washington state and California. During the second half of the 19th Century, mule train trails, stagecoach roads, and the path of the Central Pacific railroad (later the Southern Pacific railroad) also followed the route of the Siskiyou Trail. By the early 20th century, pioneering automobile roads were built along the Siskiyou Trail, including most notably the Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway ran from British Columbia to San Diego and is the immediate predecessor of much of U.S. Highway 99. The highway was continuous pavement by the mid-1930s.

===Decommissioning===
By 1968, US 99 was completely decommissioned with the near completion of I-5 in Washington and California, but the highway&#x27;s phasing out actually began July 1, 1964, when Collier Senate Bill No. 64 passed on September 20, 1963. The bill launched a major program designed to greatly simplify California&#x27;s increasingly complicated highway numbering system and eliminate concurrent postings. The highways that replaced it are

*SR 111 and SR 86 between the Mexico–US border and Indio.
*I-10, replacing US 60 and US 70 between Indio and Los Angeles as well.
*U.S. Route 101 and SR 110 in downtown Los Angeles.
*I-5 from north of downtown Los Angeles to its modern-day split in Wheeler Ridge before 99&#x27;s final decommissioning in 1968.

In 1972, AASHTO gave permission to the Oregon State Highway Commission to retire US 99W, US 99E and US 99 from the national system. The final segments of US 99 were then decommissioned and re-organized into OR 99W, OR 99E and OR 99.

===Successor highways===
All three states have replaced some portions of US 99 with state highways of the same number:
* Washington: of US 99, from Fife (in Pierce County) to Everett (in Snohomish County), is now State Route 99. It is mostly a surface-level highway with the exception of the SR 99 Tunnel through downtown Seattle. The tunnel was created to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which was torn down in 2019. 
*A 4-mile section of the old US 99 through unincorporated Hazel Dell and Salmon Creek, north of Vancouver, Washington is still known as NE Highway 99.
*Other portions of the old US 99 are now designated as SR 505, SR 529 and SR 530.

* Oregon: Most of former US 99 in Oregon now signed as Oregon Route 99 (OR 99). The route still provides surface-level access to many southern Oregon towns served by I-5. It also provides access to many towns in the Willamette Valley. Between Junction City and Portland, the highway splits into eastern and western routes known as OR 99E and OR 99W, respectively. For significant stretches, OR 99 shares an alignment with I-5. Officially, the highway is signed with both route numbers when this occurs; however, in practice, this is often not the case as the OR 99 designation is dropped in favor of I-5. One notable exception is a stretch of OR 99E that runs between Albany and Salem, where OR 99E is cosigned along the highway.
* California: The stretch between Wheeler Ridge and Red Bluff is signed as State Route 99 which makes it California&#x27;s second-longest state highway behind SR 1. However, the newly enacted &quot;Historic U.S. Route 99&quot; extends from Indio starting from Interstate 10 in the Coachella Valley all the way down the Imperial Valley to Calexico on the US-Mexico border with Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico.

==Special routes==

===US Route 99W (California)===
US 99W in California ran from Sacramento, where it diverged from highway 99E, to Red Bluff. This section of the highway ran through towns such as Corning, Orland, Willows, Artois, Williams, and Maxwell. This section of the highway runs parallel with current day Interstate 5.

=== US Route 99E (California) ===
US 99E in California ran from Sacramento to Red Bluff and was partially concurrent to California State Route 36. This section of the highway ran through towns such as Chico, Durham, Richvale, and Yuba City. This section of the highway is currently used as part of California&#x27;s State Route 99.

===US Route 99W (Oregon)===
US 99W in Oregon ran from Junction City, where it diverged from highway 99E, to Portland. The US designation was redesignated as Oregon Route 99W in 1972. In 1994, Oregon 99W was truncated to Interstate 5 in Tigard at Exit 294. As such, highways 99W and 99E no longer converge.

===US Route 99E (Oregon)===
US 99E in Oregon ran from Junction City, where it diverged from highway 99W, to Portland, but using a different route than highway 99W. A segment between Albany and Salem is cosigned with Interstate 5. Like its western counterpart, US 99E was changed to state highway 99E in 1972. Its current northern terminus is at Interstate 5 in Delta Park near the Portland Expo Center at Exit 307.

Two routes in Washington were designated US Route 99 Alternate; both passed through parts of Bellingham, and for about twelve years both had this designation at the same time.

In 1931, a new route for US 99 was constructed near the east side of Lake Samish (similar to the route of today&#x27;s Interstate 5), and US 99 was moved to this new road. As a result, the older 99 route past Bellingham Bay (Chuckanut Drive) was designated as US 99 Alternate. Today, this older route is Washington State Route 11.

Beginning in 1952, the other US Route 99 Alternate began in downtown Bellingham and went due north along the Guide Meridian to Lynden and then to Canada. This highway was decommissioned in 1969 and is today known as Washington State Route 539.

Both of these routes were renumbered in the 1960s when the state decommissioned all of US Route 99 and scrapped its entire highway numbering system to replace it with a new system.
==Legacy==
Travel on U.S. Route 99 is highlighted in a long poem by Gary Snyder, &quot;Night Highway 99&quot;. The Sega videogame &quot;Sonic Advance 3&quot; has a zone titled &quot;Route 99,&quot; but this could be coincidental.

Route 99 was planned to be featured in Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars 3&quot;, as confirmed by Michael Wallis. However, this never went through.

<text>Makruk (; ; ), or Thai chess (; ; ), is a strategy board game that is descended from the 6th-century Indian game of chaturanga or a close relative thereof, and is therefore related to chess. It is part of the family of chess variants.

In Cambodia, where basically the same game is played, it is known as ouk (, ) or ouk chatrang (, ).

==Origin==
The Persian traders came to the Ayutthaya kingdom around the 14th century to spread their culture and to trade with the Thai kingdom. It is therefore possible that the Siamese makruk, in its present form, was directly derived from the Persian game of shatranj via the cultural exchange between the two peoples in this period. This is because the movement of makruk&#x27;s queen, or the &quot;seed&quot; (), is essentially the same as the ferz in shatranj.

However, it is more likely that the game came more directly from India given the name similarities between chaturanga and the Cambodian name, &quot;ouk chaktrang&quot; (), and the way the &quot;nobleman&quot; (, ) moves. In his History of Chess, Murray suggests it may have followed the expansion of Buddhism in the area.

==Pieces==


In the starting position, cowrie are placed on the third and sixth . Seeds are placed at the right side of lords.

==Rules==

* The cowrie shell moves one space forward and captures one space diagonally forward. Unlike in Western chess, the cowrie cannot advance two squares on its first move; therefore, it cannot be captured &quot;en passant&quot;. A cowrie that reaches the sixth rank is always promoted. It becomes a &quot;promoted pawn&quot; (เบี้ยหงาย &quot;bia ngai&quot;, in Thai, meaning overturned cowrie shell), which moves one square diagonally in any direction, like the seed. Cowrie promotion is usually denoted by flipping the piece over.

* The seed moves one space diagonally, like the ferz in shatranj. It has the same move as the overturned cowrie.
* The nobleman moves one space diagonally or one space forward, like the silver general in shogi.

* The horse moves two spaces orthogonally (that is, along a or ) and then one space perpendicular to that movement. It jumps over any pieces in the way, like the knight in Western chess.

* The boat moves any number of spaces orthogonally, like a rook in Western chess.

* The lord moves one space in any direction, like a king in Western chess. The game ends when the lord is checkmated. The game ends as a draw if the lord is stalemated, like in Western chess and unlike shatranj.

===Counting rules===

When neither side has any cowries, the game must be completed within a certain number of moves or it is declared a draw. When a piece is captured the count restarts only if it is the last piece of a player in the game.

* When neither player has any cowries left, mate must be achieved in 64 moves. The disadvantaged player counts, and may at any time choose to stop counting. If the disadvantaged player checkmates the advantage side and did not stop counting, the game is declared a draw.

When the last piece (that is not the lord) of the disadvantaged player is captured, the count may be started, or restarted from the aforementioned counting, by the weaker player, and the stronger player now has a maximum number of moves based on the pieces left:

* If there are two boats left: 8 moves
* If there is one boat left: 16 moves
* If there are no boats left, but there are two noblemen: 22 moves
* If there are no boats or noblemen left, but there are two horses: 32 moves
* If there are no boats left, but there is one nobleman: 44 moves
* If there are no boats or noblemen left, but there is one horse: 64 moves
* If there are no boats, noblemen or horses left, but only seeds: 64 moves

The disadvantaged player announces the counting of his fleeing moves, starting from the number of pieces left on the board, including both lords. The winning player has to checkmate his opponent&#x27;s lord before the maximum number is announced, otherwise the game is declared a draw. During this process, the count may restart if the counting player would like to stop and start counting again.

For example, if White has two boats and a horse against a lone black lord, he has three moves to checkmate his opponent (the given value of 8 minus the total number of pieces, 5). If Black captures a white boat, the count does not automatically restart, unless Black is willing to do so, at his own disadvantage. However, many players do not understand this and restart the counting while fleeing with the lord.

===Variants===
There are rules which do not apply to the standard, formal game, or have been abandoned in professional play. They are called sutras. The first free moves are similar to those in Cambodian ouk.

* Sut Khun สูตรขุน (&quot;King Sutra&quot;) can be compared to the castling rule in Western chess. The rule allows the player to move the lord to a blank square on next row, like a horse, so long as the lord has not yet moved.
* Sut Met สูตรเม็ด (&quot;Queen Sutra&quot;) is the most popular sutra in informal rules. It is a first free move that allows the player to move the seed and the cowrie in front of the seed at the same time. Two pieces are moved in this sutra. First, move the cowrie in front of the seed forward; then move the seed to the blank square the cowrie has just vacated, so the seed moves two squares forward.
* Sut Ma สูตรม้า (&quot;Knight Sutra&quot;) is a first free move that allows the player to move a horse and a cowrie a horse&#x27;s move from that horse in the same turn. Two pieces are moved in this sutra. First, move the cowrie which is a horse&#x27;s move from the horse forward; then move the horse to the blank square the cowrie has just vacated.
* Takhaeng Ruea ตะแคงเรือ (&quot;Boat Tilting, Rook Tilting&quot;) involves turning one or both boats upside down. This changes the boat to be a seed. This reduces the power of one or two boats.

==Cambodian chess==

Cambodia has a variant of chess that was introduced in southeast Asia centuries ago, called &quot;ouk&quot; ( ) or &quot;ouk chaktrang&quot; ( or ), with minor differences to the Thai version of chess. In Vietnam, ouk is called &quot;cờ ốc&quot;, meaning &quot;shell chess&quot;, as the shape of the pieces resemble shells.

The main rules difference involves the first movement of the lord and seed. If no pieces have been captured, the players have these options:

# On the lord&#x27;s first move, and only if not in check, of moving the lord like a horse; and
# On the seed&#x27;s first move, of moving the seed two squares straight ahead.
There is evidence that ouk has been played in Cambodia since the twelfth century, as it is depicted in several reliefs in the Angkor temples.

The first nationwide ouk tournament was held 3–4 April 2008, upon the completion of a standardized rule set by the Olympic Committee of Cambodia and the Cambodian Chess Association.

In a variant known as &quot;kar ouk&quot; (also known as &quot;ka ouk&quot;), the first player to put the other in check wins. Another variant of Cambodian chess was described by David Pritchard in the first edition of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot;, but this was later determined to have been included in error as no such game was played in Cambodia.

Ouk is one of three traditional sports introduced by Cambodia at the 2023 Southeast Asian Games, along with the martial arts of Bokator and Kun Khmer.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; &quot;Old Land of our Fathers&quot;) is a Cornish patriotic song. It is sung in the Cornish language, to the same tune as the Welsh national anthem, &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;. The Breton anthem, &quot;Bro Gozh ma Zadoù&quot;, also uses the same tune.

&quot;The Song of the Western Men&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;Trelawny&quot;, is often considered to be the Cornish anthem as well, and as in Scotland, opinion is divided on the matter, and there is no official position. The words to &quot;Trelawny&quot; are certainly more widely known amongst Cornish people.

<text>Microdisney were an Irish rock band formed in Cork in 1980. They were founded and led by songwriters Cathal Coughlan (keyboards, vocals) and Sean O&#x27;Hagan (guitar). Originally typeset as Micro Disney, the band had become Microdisney by the time they (Coughlan and O&#x27;Hagan) had relocated to London in 1983 and signed to Rough Trade Records. Between 1983 and 1986 the band recorded six Peel Sessions for BBC Radio and released their debut album for Rough Trade called &quot;Everybody Is Fantastic&quot;.

In 1985, their album &quot;The Clock Comes Down the Stairs&quot; reached number one in the UK Indie Chart, and they reached number 55 in the UK Singles Chart and the top 40 in Ireland with the 1987 single &quot;Town to Town&quot;. This single, released by Virgin Records, was followed into the UK chart by &quot;Gale Force Wind&quot; in March 1988. That 1 July, days after supporting David Bowie at London&#x27;s Dominion Theatre, the band split up.

O&#x27;Hagan and Coughlan formed separate bands, the High Llamas and the Fatima Mansions, respectively, with Coughlan also going on to work with Sean Hughes in Bubonique and Luke Haines as part of The North Sea Scrolls project. In 2017, a radio documentary was made about the band called &quot;Iron Fist in Velvet Glove – The Story of Microdisney&quot; by producer Paul McDermott, which was re-broadcast by Newstalk 106-108fm as part of their &quot;Documentary on Newstalk&quot; season.

In 2018, Microdisney reunited for the first time in 30 years, performing live in Dublin and London. In February 2019, they played their last shows in Dublin and Cork. The members of Microdisney were awarded an IMRO/NCH Trailblazer Award, given to &quot;culturally important&quot; Irish albums (in this instance, for &quot;The Clock Comes Down the Stairs&quot;) in 2018.

A 2024 documentary, titled &quot;Microdisney: The Clock Comes Down the Stairs&quot; and focusing on the band&#x27;s formation and career and reformation, was broadcast on BBC4 on 15 March 2024.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ; &quot;&quot;) is the anthem of Brittany. It is sung to the same tune as that of the national anthem of Wales, &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;, and has similar lyrics. The Cornish anthem, &quot;Bro Goth Agan Tasow&quot;, is also sung to the same tune.

This anthem is played during major sporting events at the final of the Coupe de France between the Stade Rennais F.C. and the En Avant Guingamp, at the end of a day&#x27;s broadcasting on the local radio station Bretagne 5, as well as cultural events.

==History==
The Breton lyrics are the creation of François Jaffrennou (Taldir) in 1897, and the music was that composed by James James, of Pontypridd, Wales, for &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;. The new song was first published in 1898 and circulated as &quot;Henvelidigez&quot; (&quot;Adaptation&quot;). It was chosen as the national anthem (and a song to celebrate friendship between the Welsh and Bretons) in 1903, at a Congress of the Union Régionaliste Bretonne held in Lesneven, Brittany (France). Maurice Duhamel adapted it for piano, and it was first recorded by Pathé in 1910.

In November 2021, it became the official anthem of Brittany with a new arrangement by Frédérique Lory played by the Orchestre National de Bretagne (National Orchestra of Brittany) in partnership with Comité Bro Gozh ma Zadoù and Coop Breizh.

<text>Mount Ossa is the highest mountain in Tasmania, with a summit elevation of above sea level. It makes up part of the Pelion Range within Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park in the Central Highlands region of Tasmania, Australia.

It was first surveyed by Europeans in the 1860s, and confirmed to be the state&#x27;s high point in 1954.

Like most peaks in the area it is capped with Jurassic dolerite.

==History==
The Mount Ossa highland area spans the boundary between the Big River and Northern Tasmanian Aboriginal nations. Several artifacts and campsites containing various stone types and tools have been discovered around Pelion to the north, and Lake St Clair (Tasmania) to the south.

It was first surveyed by Charles Gould in the 1860s and named after Mount Ossa in Greece following the theme of classical Greek names set by George Frankland, an early Tasmanian surveyor. However, its location was marked as on what is now called Mount Nereus, and later surveyors alternatively referred to it as Parsons Hood, Mount Dundas, Mount Blackhouse or simply numbered it. For years it was thought that Cradle Mountain was the highest in Tasmania, with inexact equipment stymying attempts to closely examine the area.

It was confirmed to be the highest mountain in Tasmania after an aerial survey in 1954.

===Early development===
In 1892 the &quot;Mole Creek and Zeehan Mineral Prospecting and Exploration Company Ltd&quot; discovered Permian coal at the base of Mt Ossa and surrounding areas, excavating several tunnels. The seams were found to be of low quality and the tunnels were not developed, although copper mining was present in the surrounding area. A 1920s attempt to prospect for oil failed after the government warned investors away.

Mining and surveying activities led to the development of the area. Stewards Track was created from the east, and was extended and renamed the Innes Track (now Arm River Track). Old Pelion Hut formed the base of mining operations, and still stands today as a hut on the Overland Track and start point for bushwalkers climbing Mount Ossa.

Trappers worked in the area from the 1860s until the collapse of the fur trade in the 1950s, although hunting in the park was declared illegal after 1927. They established huts, some of which are still in use, and burned the land to encourage fresh growth and game.

===National park===
In the 1910s Gustav and Kate Weindorfer began campaigning for the area from Cradle Mountain to Lake St Clair, including Mount Ossa, to be a national park. It was declared a scenic reserve in 1922, a wildlife reserve in 1927 and its current designation of national park from 1947. During this transition former trappers began building huts and guiding bushwalkers, including Paddy Hartnett, Weindorfer and Bob Quaile.

Since then Mount Ossa has become a popular bushwalking destination with an established route to the top. In 1991 30 per cent of Overland Track walkers detoured up the mountain.

==Climbing==

Mount Ossa can be climbed via a well worn track from Pelion Gap to the summit. It can be approached either as a side trip from the Overland Track or via the Arm River Track. Conditions can be very severe in winter, with powerful winds and freezing temperatures. A short scramble is required to ascend the summit.

<doc id="754800" wikidata="Q1330376" url="?curid=754800" title="Mount Bartle Frere">
<text>Mount Bartle Frere (pronunciation [ˈmæɔnt̥ ˈbɐːɾəɫ ˈfɹɪə]; Ngajanji: Choorechillum) is the highest mountain in Queensland at an elevation of . The mountain was named after Sir Henry Bartle Frere, a British colonial administrator and then president of the Royal Geographical Society by George Elphinstone Dalrymple in 1873. Bartle Frere was British Governor of Cape Colony at the outset of the Anglo-Zulu War. 

It is located south of Cairns in the Wooroonooran National Park southwest of the town of Babinda on the eastern edge of the Atherton Tablelands. Mount Bartle Frere is part of the Bellenden Ker Range and the watershed of Russell River.

The foothill to summit is entirely covered by rainforest, ranging from typical tropical rainforest in the lowlands to low cloud forest at the cooler summit, where temperatures are up to 10 °C (18 °F) lower than on the coast. Despite the treacherous climb, reaching the top offers an expansive view of the surrounding area.

==History==
The first European to scale the mountain was Christie Palmerston in 1886. He blazed a tree at the summit &quot;&#x27;P&#x27; October 26,&#x27;86.&quot;. Its immediate neighbour Mount Bellenden Ker is the second highest mountain in Queensland at 1593 metres.

On 21 April 1942 an American Air Corps B-25 Mitchell medium-range bomber (41-12455), from the 3rd Bomb Group, 90th Bomb Squadron, crashed on the mountain with the loss of all seven crew members. This particular aircraft had only recently returned from the Royce Raid against Japanese forces in the Philippines.

==Climbing==
The summit of Mount Bartle Frere, when it is not covered in cloud, offers the chance to view both the coastal lowlands and the Atherton Tablelands. The climb can be quite steep in places with some rock scrambling required. Sudden weather changes have been known to occur in the area. The ascent to the summit can be quite treacherous and many tourists have become lost, some for several days, while climbing the mountain. The main reasons for this are the unpredictable weather, poor preparation and occasionally obscure track markers. Nonetheless, an experienced climber should have no problem summiting after an early start from the Josephine Falls car park.

The total distance from Josephine Falls is 15 km return and would normally take between 10–12 hours. The vertical elevation gained is around 1500 metres. This area of Queensland records several metres of rain every year, so it is not unusual for the peak to be covered in cloud. The best time to climb Bartle Frere is during the dry season (April to October) when the weather is cooler and likelihood of rain is lower. There are yellow markers placed reasonably clearly every kilometre along the trail.

An easier alternative is to approach from a small camp site at the western side. It is reachable by car via Topaz Road and Gourka Road. From this starting point (at an altitude of 700 m), it&#x27;s relatively easy to complete the climb and descent in a day. It is a favourite with local bushwalking clubs and is best attempted in the dry winter months, from June to October. Walking during the wet season (November to March) brings with it the risks of torrential tropical downpours and poor visibility. Rock slips occur occasionally. Leeches are a hazard at any time of year. 

There is a shorter 10 km return trail to &#x27;Broken Nose&#x27;, a spur feature on the southern side from Josephine Falls. Although there is a large map at the Josephine Falls car park, there are no other maps or ranger station before the climb.

==Environment==

===Climate===
Although no rain gauge exists on the mountain, data at nearby Mount Bellenden Ker suggest an annual average rainfall of around , and an estimated potential maximum as high as , both of which would make the mountain one of the wettest places in the world. Even in what constitutes the &quot;dry&quot; in most of tropical Australia, rainfall on the summit is very heavy at around in May and in August, whilst in the wettest month of March estimated averages are as high as and maxima around . Calculations based on available lowland data (from Innisfail, Cairns and Port Douglas) would suggest &quot;daily&quot; rainfalls could have been potentially as high as during a cyclone in 1911 – which if accurate would be the highest daily rainfall in the world.

===Vegetation===

The high altitude and rainfall of the mountain create conditions for a number of vegetation types growing on the poor granitic soils. The lower slopes support lowland tropical rainforest (complex mesophyll vine forest) with a great diversity of large leaved trees, climbers, epiphytes, palms and ferns. With increasing elevation the rainforest changes to a less diverse smaller leaved notophyll type. At elevations above 1000 m, simple microphyll vine fern forest is found with species such as the purple kauri pine (&quot;Agathis atropurpurea&quot;), &quot;Elaeocarpus ferruginiflora&quot; and pimple bark (&quot;Balanops australiana&quot;). With further increases in altitude, increasing exposure and cloud contact create conditions ideal for the formation of cloud forest (simple microphyll vine fern thicket); many of the species are rare or endemic and most trees are shrouded in mosses and other bryophytes. 

The stunted tree &quot;Eucryphia wilkei&quot; found in the cloud forest above 1500 m elevation on Mount Bartle Frere exists nowhere else on earth and has relatives in the cool temperate rainforests of Tasmania and Chile. Other notable species include the mountain aspen &quot;Acronychia chooreechillum&quot;, &quot;Trochocarpa bellendenkerensis&quot;, &quot;Polyscias bellendenkerensis&quot;, the vine &quot;Parsonsia bartlensis&quot; and Australia&#x27;s only native rhododendron, &quot;Rhododendron lochiae&quot;, which grows on top of the large granite boulders or as an epiphyte in the cloud forest canopy. &quot;Eidothea zoexylocarya&quot; was initially discovered on the slopes of Mount Bartle Frere, which holds its main populations.

In some areas near the summit the granitic soil is so leached of nutrients by the very high rainfall that rainforest plants are replaced by heath plants such as &quot;Acrothamnus spathaceus&quot;, &quot;Acrotriche baileyana&quot;, ferns, (&quot;Gleichenia&quot; species), carnivorous sundews (&quot;Drosera&quot; species) and the orchid, &quot;Dipodium ensifolium&quot;.

===Fauna===
The Bartle Frere skink (&quot;Techmarscincus jigurru&quot;), an endangered species of lizard, is found on the slopes of Mount Bartle Frere and surrounding peaks above .

Mount Bartle Frere is commemorated in the scientific names of two other species of lizards found on the mountain, &quot;Bellatorias frerei&quot; and &quot;Concinnia frerei&quot;.

The mountain lies in the Wooroonooran Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of a range of bird species endemic to Queensland&#x27;s Wet Tropics.

<doc id="754804" wikidata="Q104969456" url="?curid=754804" title="Gay men">
<text>Gay men are male homosexuals. Some bisexual and homoromantic men may dually identify as &quot;gay&quot; and a number of gay men also identify as &quot;queer&quot;. Historic terminology for gay men has included &quot;inverts&quot; and &quot;uranians&quot;.

Gay men continue to face significant discrimination in large parts of the world, particularly in most of Asia and Africa. In the United States and the western world, many gay men still experience discrimination in their daily lives, though some openly gay men have reached national success and prominence, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and heads of state or government such as Xavier Bettel (Luxembourg), Edgars Rinkēvičs (Latvia), Gabriel Attal (France), and Leo Varadkar (Ireland).

The word &quot;gay&quot; is recommended by LGBTQ groups and style guides to describe all people exclusively attracted to members of the same sex, while &quot;lesbian&quot; refers specifically to female homosexuals, and &quot;gay men&quot; to male homosexuals.

==Male homosexuality in world history==
Some scholars argue that the terms &quot;homosexual&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; are problematic when applied to men in ancient cultures since, for example, neither Greeks or Romans possessed any one word covering the same semantic range as the modern concept of &quot;homosexuality&quot;. Furthermore, there were diverse sexual practices that varied in acceptance depending on time and place. Other scholars argue that there are significant similarities between ancient and modern male homosexuals.

In cultures influenced by Abrahamic religions, the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature. The condemnation of anal sex between males, however, predates Christian belief. Throughout the majority of Christian history, most Christian theologians and denominations have considered homosexual behavior as immoral or sinful. Many historical figures, including Socrates, Lord Byron, Edward II, and Hadrian, have had terms such as &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;bisexual&quot; applied to them. Some scholars, such as Michel Foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary construction of sexuality foreign to their times, though other scholars challenge this.

===Africa===

The first recorded possible homosexual male couple in history is commonly deemed to be Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum, an ancient Egyptian couple, who lived around 2400 BCE. The pair are portrayed in a nose-kissing position, the most intimate pose in Egyptian art, surrounded by what appear to be their heirs. The 6th- or 7th-century Ashmolean Parchment AN 1981.940 provides the only example in the Coptic language of a love spell between men. More recently, the European colonization of Africa resulted in the introduction of anti-sodomy laws, and is generally regarded as the central reason why African nations have such stringent laws against gay men today. Three countries or jurisdictions have imposed the death penalty for gay men in Africa. These include Mauritania and several regions in Nigeria and Jubaland.

===Americas===
As is true of many other non-Western cultures, it is difficult to determine the extent to which Western notions of sexual orientation apply to Pre-Columbian cultures. Evidence of homoerotic sexual acts between men has been found in many pre-conquest civilizations in Latin America, such as the Aztecs, Mayas, Quechuas, Moches, Zapotecs, the Incas, and the Tupinambá of Brazil. In fact, in Aztec mythology, the deity Xochipilli was a symbol of gay men and male prostitutes.

The Spanish &quot;conquistadors&quot; expressed horror at discovering sodomy openly practiced among native men and used it as evidence of their supposed inferiority. The &quot;conquistadors&quot; talked extensively of sodomy among the natives to depict them as savages and hence justify their conquest and forced conversion to Christianity. As a result of the growing influence and power of the conquistadors, many Native leaders started condemning homosexual acts themselves. During the period following European colonization, homosexuality was prosecuted by the Inquisition, sometimes leading to death sentences on the charges of sodomy, and the practices became clandestine. Many homosexual men went into heterosexual marriages to keep appearances, and some turned to the clergy to escape public scrutiny.

During the Mexican Inquisition, after a series of denunciations, authorities arrested 123 men in 1658 on suspicion of homosexuality. Although many escaped, the Royal Criminal Court sentenced fourteen men from different social and ethnic backgrounds to death by public burning, in accordance to the law passed by Isabella the Catholic in 1497. The sentences were carried out together on one day, 6 November 1658. The records of these trials and those that occurred in 1660, 1673 and 1687, suggest that Mexico City, like many other large cities at the time had an active underworld.

===East Asia===

In East Asia, same-sex relations between men has been noted since the earliest recorded history. Homosexuality in China, known as the &quot;passions of the cut peach&quot; and various other euphemisms, has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. Male homosexuality was mentioned in many famous works of Chinese literature. The instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period. Confucianism, being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Ming dynasty literature, such as &quot;Bian Er Chai&quot; (弁而釵/弁而钗), portray homosexual relationships between men as more enjoyable and more &quot;harmonious&quot; than heterosexual relationships. Writings from the Liu Song dynasty by Wang Shunu claimed that homosexuality was as common as heterosexuality in the late 3rd century China. Opposition to male homosexuality in China originates in the medieval Tang dynasty (618–907), attributed to the rising influence of Christian and Islamic values, but did not become fully established until the Westernization efforts of the late Qing dynasty and the Republic of China.

===Europe===

====Classical period====


The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and mythographic materials) concerning same-sex male relationships are derived from ancient Greece. These relationships were constrained between &quot;normal&quot; men and their young male lovers. Relationships between adult men, however, were still largely considered taboo in Ancient Greek culture. Given the importance in Greek society of cultivating the masculinity of the adult male and the perceived feminizing effect of being the passive partner, relations between adult men of comparable social status were considered highly problematic, and usually associated with social stigma.

This stigma, however, was reserved for only the passive partner in the relationship. According to contemporary opinion, Greek men who took on a passive sexual role after reaching adulthood – at which point they were expected to take the reverse role in pederastic relationships and become the active and dominant member – thereby were feminized or &quot;made a woman&quot; of themselves. There is ample evidence in the theater of Aristophanes that derides these passive men and gives a glimpse of the type of biting social opprobrium and shame (&quot;atimia&quot;) heaped upon them by their society.

Some scholars argue that there are examples of male homosexual love in ancient literature, such as Achilles and Patroclus in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In Ancient Rome, young men&#x27;s bodies remained a focus of male sexual attention, but relationships were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex. The Hellenophile emperor Hadrian is renowned for his relationship with Antinous, but the Christian emperor Theodosius I decreed a law on 6 August 390, condemning passive males to be burned at the stake.

====Renaissance====

During the Renaissance, wealthy cities in northern Italy—Florence and Venice in particular—were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome. But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the Officers of the Night court, were prosecuting, fining, and imprisoning a good portion of that population.
From the second half of the 13th century, death was the punishment for male homosexuality in most of Europe.
The relationships of socially prominent figures, such as King James I and the Duke of Buckingham, served to highlight the issue, including in anonymously authored street pamphlets: &quot;The world is chang&#x27;d I know not how, For men Kiss Men, not Women now; ... Of J. the First and Buckingham: He, true it is, his Wives Embraces fled, To slabber his lov&#x27;d Ganimede&quot; (&quot;Mundus Foppensis, or The Fop Display&#x27;d&quot;, 1691).

===Middle East===

In ancient Sumer, a set of priests known as &quot;gala&quot; worked in the temples of the goddess Inanna, where they performed elegies and lamentations. &quot;Gala&quot; took female names, spoke in the &quot;eme-sal&quot; dialect, which was traditionally reserved for women, and appear to have engaged in homosexual intercourse. The Sumerian sign for &quot;gala&quot; was a ligature of the signs for &quot;penis&quot; and &quot;anus&quot;. One Sumerian proverb reads: &quot;When the &quot;gala&quot; wiped off his ass [he said], &#x27;I must not arouse that which belongs to my mistress [i.e., Inanna]. In later Mesopotamian cultures, &quot;kurgarrū&quot; and &quot;assinnu&quot; were male servants of the goddess Ishtar (Inanna&#x27;s East Semitic equivalent), who dressed in female clothing and performed war dances in Ishtar&#x27;s temples. Several Akkadian proverbs seem to suggest that they may have also engaged in homosexual intercourse. In ancient Assyria, male homosexuality was present and common; it was also not prohibited, condemned, nor looked upon as immoral or disordered. Some religious texts contain prayers for divine blessings on homosexual relationships. The &quot;Almanac of Incantations&quot; contained prayers favoring on an equal basis the love of a man for a woman, of a woman for a man, and of a man for man.

==Gay men in modern Western history==
The use of &quot;gay&quot; to mean a &quot;homosexual&quot; man was first used as an extension of its application to prostitution: a &quot;gay boy&quot; was a young man or adolescent serving male clients. Similarly, a &quot;gay cat&quot; was a young man apprenticed to an older hobo and commonly exchanging sex and other services for protection and tutelage. The application to homosexuality was also an extension of the word&#x27;s sexualized connotation of &quot;uninhibited&quot;, which implied a willingness to disregard conventional sexual mores. In court in 1889, the prostitute John Saul stated: &quot;I occasionally do odd-jobs for different gay people.&quot;

&quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938) was the first film to use the word &quot;gay&quot; in an apparent reference to homosexuality. In a scene in which Cary Grant&#x27;s character&#x27;s clothes have been sent to the cleaners, he is forced to wear a woman&#x27;s feather-trimmed robe. When another character asks about his robe, he responds, &quot;Because I just went &quot;gay&quot; all of a sudden!&quot; Since this was a mainstream film at a time, when the use of the word to refer to cross-dressing (and, by extension, homosexuality) would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean, &quot;I just decided to do something frivolous.&quot;

In 1950, the earliest reference found to date for the word gay as a self-described name for male homosexuals came from Alfred A. Gross, executive secretary for the George W. Henry Foundation, who said in the June 1950 issue of &quot;Sir&quot; magazine: &quot;I have yet to meet a happy homosexual. They have a way of describing themselves as gay, but the term is a misnomer. Those who are habitues of the bars frequented by others of the kind, are about the saddest people I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

===Gay men in the Holocaust===
Gay men were one of the primary victims of the Nazi Holocaust. Historically, the earliest legal step towards the Nazi persecution of male homosexuality was 1871&#x27;s Paragraph 175, a law passed after the unification of the German Empire. Paragraph 175 read: &quot;An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex ... is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights might also be imposed.&quot; The law was interpreted in varying ways in Germany until 23 April 1880, when the &quot;Reichsgericht&quot; ruled that criminal homosexual acts involved either anal, oral, or intercrural sex between two men. Anything less (such as kissing and cuddling) was deemed harmless play.

Franz Gürtner, the &quot;Reich&quot; Justice Minister amended Paragraph 175 to address &quot;loopholes&quot; in the law after the Night of the Long Knives. The 1935 version of Paragraph 175 declared &quot;expressions&quot; of homosexuality as prosecutable crimes. The most important change to the law was the definitional shift of male homosexuality from &quot;An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex&quot; to instead &quot;A male who commits a sex offense with another male.&quot; This expanded the reach of the law to persecute gay men as a people group, rather than male homosexuality as a sexual act. Kissing, mutual masturbation and love-letters between men were now seen as legitimate reasons for the police to make arrests. The law never defined a &quot;sex offence&quot;, leaving it to interpretation.

Between 1933 and 1945, an estimated 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals under the Nazi regime, of whom some 50,000 were officially sentenced. Most of these men served time in prison, while an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 were incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps. Rüdiger Lautmann argued that the death rate of homosexuals in concentration camps may have been as high as 60%. Gay men in the camps suffered an unusual degree of cruelty by their captors and were regularly used as the subjects for Nazi medical experiments as scientists tried to find a &quot;cure&quot; for homosexuality.

===AIDS crisis in the United States===

The HIV/AIDS epidemic is considered the deadliest period in modern history for gay men, and the generation of young gay men who died in the crisis is known as the &quot;lost generation&quot;. At its start, the epidemic was particularly severe in the United States. In 1980, San Francisco resident Ken Horne was reported to the CDC with Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma (KS). He was retroactively identified as the first patient of the AIDS epidemic in the US. In 1981, Lawrence Mass became the first journalist in the world to write about the epidemic in the &quot;New York Native&quot;. Later that year, the CDC reported a cluster of &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia in five gay men in Los Angeles. The next month, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran the headline: &quot;Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals&quot;. The illness was soon termed &quot;Gay Related Immunodeficiency&quot; (G.R.I.D.), because it was believed to only affect gay men. In June 1982, Larry Kramer founded the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis to provide food and support to gay men dying in New York City. During the early years of the AIDS crisis, gay men were treated pitilessly in hospital quarantine wards, left alone without contact for weeks at a time.

During the early years of the epidemic, there was significant misinformation surrounding the illness. Rumors swirled that being in the same room or being touched by a gay man could lead one to contract HIV. It was not until April 1984 that the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler announced in a press conference that the American scientist Robert Gallo had discovered the &quot;probable cause&quot; of AIDS, the retrovirus which would be named &quot;human immunodeficiency virus&quot; or HIV. In September 1985, during his second term in office, US President Ronald Reagan publicly mentioned AIDS for the first time after being asked about his administration&#x27;s lack of medical research funding for the crisis. Four months later, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated, &quot;One million Americans have already been infected with the virus and that this number will jump to at least 2 million or 3 million within 5 to 10 years.&quot; Gay men, trans women, and bisexual men faced the brunt of deaths during the first decade of the crisis. Activists claimed the government was responding to the epidemic with apathy because of the perceived &quot;social undesirability&quot; of these groups. To address this perceived apathy, activists such as Vito Russo, Larry Kramer, and others, took more militant approaches to AIDS activism, organizing direct action through organizations like ACT UP in order to force pharmaceutical corporations and government agencies to respond to the epidemic with more urgency. ACT UP eventually grew into a transnational organization, with 140 chapters around the world, while the AIDS crisis ultimately became a global epidemic. By 2019, complications related to AIDS had taken 32.7 million lives worldwide.

==Legal status of gay men in modern society==

===Africa===
There are 54 nations in Africa recognized by the United Nations and/or African Union. In 34 of these states, male homosexuality is explicitly outlawed. In a 2015 report, Human Rights Watch noted that in Benin and the Central African Republic, male homosexuality is not explicitly outlawed, but both have laws which are applied differently for gay men than for straight men. In Mauritania, northern Nigeria, Somaliland, and Somalia, male homosexuality is punishable by death. In Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda, gay men receive life imprisonment for homosexual acts, though the law is not regularly enforced in Sierra Leone. In Nigeria, legislation has also made it illegal for family members, allies, and friends of gay men to openly express support for homosexuality, and the country is generally recognized for its &quot;cold-blooded&quot; attitudes toward gay men. Nigerian law states that any heterosexual person &quot;who administers, witnesses, abets or aids&quot; male homosexual activity should receive a 10-year jail sentence. In Uganda, Christian fundamentalist organizations from the United States funded the introduction of &quot;Kill the Gays&quot; legislation to impose the death penalty for gay men. The bill was ruled unconstitutional by the Ugandan Supreme Court in 2014, but retains support in the country and has been reconsidered for implementation. Of all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa has the most liberal attitudes toward gay men. In 2006, South Africa became the fifth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage, and the Constitution of South Africa guarantees gay men and lesbians full equal rights and protections. South Africa is the only country in Africa where LGBT discrimination is constitutionally forbidden; however, social discrimination against South African gay men persists in rural parts of the country, where high levels of religious tradition continue to fuel prejudice and violence.

===Caribbean===
In the mainland Americas (both North and South), male homosexuality is legal in every country (except Guyana). In the Caribbean, however, nine nations have criminal punishment for &quot;buggery&quot; on their statute books. These countries include Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, Guyana, and Jamaica. In Jamaica, sexual intercourse between men is legally punishable by imprisonment, though the law&#x27;s repeal is pending. Sexual intercourse between women is already legal, though lesbians in Jamaica still experience a high level of social stigma.

In Jamaica, reports of vigilante violence and torture against gay men have been reported by the Jamaican police. In 2013, Amnesty International reported that &quot;Gay men and lesbian women have been beaten, cut, burned, raped and shot on account of their sexuality. ... We are concerned that these reports are just the tip of the iceberg. Many gay men and women in Jamaica are too afraid to go to the authorities and seek help&quot;. As a result of this violence, hundreds of gay men from Jamaica sought to emigrate to countries with better human rights records. A 2016 poll from J-Flag showed that 88 percent of those polled disapprove of homosexuality, though since 2018, discriminatory attitudes have decreased slightly.

In the Caribbean, like in other developing countries around the world, homosexual identity is often associated with Westernization, and as a result, homophobia is believed to be an anti-colonial tool. Wayne Marshall wrote that gay men are believed to be &quot;decadent products of the West&quot; and &quot;are thus to be resisted alongside other forms of colonization, cultural or political&quot;. Wayne cites the example of the Jamaican dancehall hit &quot;Dem Bow&quot; by Shabba Ranks, which calls for the violent murder of gay men alongside a call for the &quot;freedom for Black people&quot;. Marshall notes the irony of this ideological position, considering the historical evidence that homophobia was introduced to colonies by European colonists. Nevertheless, Caribbean scholars have noted the importance of opposition to gay men for Jamaican male gender construction. Kingsley Ragashanti Stewart, a professor of anthropology at the University of the West Indies, writes, &quot;A lot of Jamaican men, if you call them a homosexual, ... will immediately get violent. It&#x27;s the worst insult you could give to a Jamaican man.&quot; Stewart writes that homophobia influences Caribbean society even at the micro level of language. He writes of urban youth vernacular, &quot;It&#x27;s like if you say, &#x27;Come back here,&#x27; they will say, &#x27;No, no, no don&#x27;t say &quot;come back&quot;.&#x27; You have to say, &#x27;come forward,&#x27; because come back is implying that you&#x27;re &#x27;coming in the back,&#x27; which is how gay men have sex.&quot;

===Eastern Europe===
In Eastern Europe, there has been a steady erosion of rights for gay men over the course of the last decade. In the Russian republic of Chechnya, gay men have been subjected to forced disappearances—secret abductions, imprisonment, torture—and extrajudicial killing by authorities. An unknown number of men, detained due to suspicion of them being gay or bisexual, have died while held in concentration camps. Independent media and human rights groups have reported that gay men are being sent to clandestine camps in Chechnya, described by one eyewitness as &quot;closed prison, the existence of which no one officially knows&quot;. Some gay men have attempted to flee the region, but have been detained by Russian police and sent back to Chechnya. Reports have emerged of prison officials releasing accused gay men from the camps after securing assurances from their families that their families will kill them (at least one man was reported by a witness as having died after returning to his family). These imprisoned men are kept in extremely cramped conditions, with 30 to 40 people detained in one room (two to three metres big), and few are afforded a trial. Witnesses have also reported that the gay men are regularly beaten (with polypropylene pipes below the waist), tortured with electricity, and spat in the face by prison guards. In some cases the process of torture has resulted in the death of the person being tortured. As of 2021, the situation in Chechnya continues to worsen for gay men. In other countries in Eastern Europe, rights for gay men continue to deteriorate. Polish President Andrzej Duda has pledged to ban teaching about gay men in schools, forbid same-sex marriage and adoption, and establish &quot;LGBT-free zones&quot;.

A 2017 Pew Research Center poll found that the majority of Orthodox Christians in the Eastern European and former USSR states surveyed believe that homosexuality &quot;should not be accepted by society&quot;; 45% of Orthodox Christians in Greece and 31% in the United States answered the same way.

===Southwest Asia and North Africa===

In Southwest Asia and North Africa, gay men face some of the harshest and most hostile laws anywhere in the world. Sex between men is explicitly outlawed in 10 of the 18 &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; countries and is punishable by death in six. According to scholars, recent popular turns toward Islamic fundamentalism has strongly influenced the extreme violence against gay men. While all same-sex activity is legal in Bahrain, Cyprus, the West Bank, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, and Iraq, male homosexuality is illegal and punishable by imprisonment in Syria, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and Egypt. Israel is the most progressive concerning LGBT rights and recognizing unregistered cohabitation; however, it has faced criticism from academics such as Sarah Schulman and Jason Ritchie for &quot;pinkwashing.&quot; And although same-sex marriage is not legal in the country, there is public support for recognizing and registering same-sex marriages performed in other countries.

Male same-sex activity is also punishable by death in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Qatar. In the Gaza Strip and Yemen, punishment for male homosexuality varies between death and imprisonment depending on the act committed. In 2018, a transnational survey conducted in the region by Pew Research Center found that 80% of people polled believed homosexuality was &quot;morally unacceptable&quot;, though others argue that the true number of people who support rights for gay men is unclear due to fear of backlash and punishment.

==Gay men&#x27;s contemporary art and culture==
===High fashion===
Since the early 20th century, gay men, both out and closeted, have worked as some of the world&#x27;s most influential fashion designers and started some of the most important fashion houses. Cristóbal Balenciaga (b. 1895), who started the Balenciaga brand, was gay but remained private about his sexuality for his entire life. His long-time partner, Franco-Polish millionaire Władzio Jaworowski d&#x27;Attainville, set up the fund for him to start the house. After d&#x27;Attainville died, Balenciaga&#x27;s following collection was designed entirely in black to mourn his loss. The French fashion designer Christian Dior (b. 1905) was another hugely influential fashion designer of the 20th century. Dior never married nor openly identified as a gay man, however, he was known to frequent the gay cultural scene in Paris and was infamously described by Coco Chanel as never having intimately &quot;known&quot; a woman. Yves Saint Laurent (b. 1935), also regarded as being among the foremost fashion designers in the twentieth century, was openly gay; his long-time partner was Pierre Berge. Gianni Versace (b. 1946), an Italian fashion designer and founder of Versace, publicly came out in an interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot; in July 1995. Versace was murdered in 1997.

A younger generation of gay men gained prominence in the fashion world during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Tom Ford (b. 1961) founded his eponymous brand Tom Ford in 2005 and has stated that he realized he was gay as a young man visiting Studio 54 in the 1980s. Alexander McQueen (b. 1969), who was also openly gay, founded his own label Alexander McQueen in 1992 and was recognized as a fashion prodigy for his revolutionary designs. McQueen said he realized his sexual orientation when he was six years old. In 2000, McQueen had a marriage ceremony with his partner George Forsyth, a documentary filmmaker, on a yacht in Ibiza. McQueen died by suicide in 2010, shortly after the death of his mother. In recent years, gay men have continued to produce some of the most influential fashion in the world, including by designers such as Jeremy Scott (b. 1975), Jason Wu (b. 1982), and Alexander Wang (b. 1983).

===Art===
In the 20th century, gay men were amongst the Western world&#x27;s most influential and prolific artists, writers, and dancers. In the United States by mid-century, James Baldwin (b. 1924) was considered one of the best writers of his generation. His work, including &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot; (1956) dealt openly with homosexuality and bisexuality at a time when sex between men was still illegal throughout much of the Western world. Other major artists of Baldwin&#x27;s generation, including Robert Rauschenberg (b. 1925) and Jasper Johns (b. 1930), were less open about their sexuality, and even made fun of other young gay artists of their generation, such as Andy Warhol, for being too feminine. In the world of New York dance, Alvin Ailey (b. 1931) fused theater, modern dance, ballet, and jazz with black vernacular, and his choreographic magnum opus &quot;Revelations&quot; is recognized as one of the most popular and most performed ballets in the world. Ailey remained closeted for much of his life, and he passed from an AIDS related illness at the age of 58. David Hockney (b. 1937), another major artist of the Silent Generation, was an important contributor to the pop art movement of the 1960s and is considered one of the most influential British artists of the 20th century. He has been openly gay for much of his life.

Many of the most influential gay and bisexual artists of the Boomer and X generations died at very early ages during the AIDS crises, including Carlos Almaraz (b. 1941), Robert Mapplethorpe (b. 1946), Félix González-Torres (b. 1957), and Keith Haring (b. 1958). Much of the Art of the AIDS Crisis was highly political and critical of the U.S. government and has been described as &quot;afraid, angry, fearful, and defiant&quot;. In the aftermath of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, gay men and other queer artists pioneered a new form of experimental filmmaking called New Queer Cinema. Today, gay men such as Mark Bradford, Julio Salgado, and Kehinde Wiley are amongst the most influential artists of their generation. Much of contemporary Western gay art today deals with themes of body, identity, and experience.

Outside of the West, art containing themes of gay male sexuality is still considered subversive and taboo. In Singapore, which criminalized all sexual acts between men through Section 377A of the Penal Code until 2022, art by gay men is considered countercultural. Gay men in Singapore historically have been depicted negatively in local mainstream media, and efforts to counter this discrimination from wider Singaporean society has been made difficult because of the risk of jail, bans, and censorship by the state.

=== Film and media art===
In the United States, Andy Warhol made underground films with queer themes and actors. His work had an international influence in queer film art. The avant-garde director Rosa von Praunheim has made more than 100 films on queer topics since the late 1960s, some of them have been evaluated internationally. Some films are considered milestones in queer cinema. Von Praunheim is internationally recognized as an icon of queer cinema. The director Rainer Werner Fassbinder had an early influence on queer cinema with films like Querelle (1982). These filmmakers and others pioneered queer Hollywood productions like Brokeback Mountain (2005), which reached an audience of millions.

===Drag===

Drag queens are a significant part of the popular culture of gay men and are regularly featured in gay bars. Drag queens use drag clothing and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles as part of a performance used for artistic or entertainment purposes. Drag shows often include lip-syncing, dancing, and live singing. They occur at events like drag pageants and gay pride parades and in nightclubs and cabarets, as well as in local gay bars. Drag queens vary by dedication, type, and culture, and range from professionals who star in films and on Broadway, such as Gene Malin, Divine, or Rupaul, to people who do drag only occasionally.

Drag balls themselves have a long history for gay men in the United States. In 1869 at the Hamilton Lodge in Harlem, the first drag balls were held. These balls were held in secret, but news grew of their existence as a safe place for gay men to congregate. The balls were deemed immoral and illegal, and a moral reform organization known as the Committee of Fourteen investigated alleged &quot;immoral&quot; activities. In 1916, the committee released a report describing &quot;&#x27;phenomenal ... male perverts&#x27; in expensive frocks and wigs, looking like women&quot;. By the 1920s, the balls grew in public visibility. In New York, the events, once called Masquerade and Civic Balls, were called &quot;Faggots Balls&quot; by the general public. The balls, however, also attracted some of the city&#x27;s top artists and writers, including Charles Henri Ford and Parker Tyler. The men, who co-authored &quot;The Young and Evil&quot;, described the drag ball as &quot;a scene whose celestial flavor and cerulean coloring no angelic painter or nectarish poet has ever conceived ... lit up like high mass.&quot; This flourishing of gay life in the 1920s and 30s was part of a period known as the Pansy Craze.

More recently, the film &quot;Paris is Burning&quot; (1990) detailed the drag ball scene of New York City and showcased the lives and experiences of a group of young &quot;butch queens&quot; (cisgender gay men), transgender women, drag queens, and butch women. Since its release, the film has become a cult classic and has served as an organizing and academic tool for the gay and trans communities (though it has been subject to significant criticism). Meanwhile, the television reality program &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; has been on-air in the United States since 2009 and has introduced the straight mainstream to gay men&#x27;s popular culture through drag. The original American series has since developed into the global &quot;Drag Race&quot; franchise.

In the 2020s, a wave of anti-LGBT backlash in the United States resulted in what is known as the Drag panic. As part of this backlash, some U.S. states, such as Tennessee, criminalized the public performance of drag.

===Camp===

Camp is a visual aesthetic style often associated with gay men. An English definition of the term first appeared in a 1909 edition of the Oxford English Dictionary: &quot;ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical; effeminate or homosexual; pertaining to, characteristic of, homosexuals&quot;. From its original meaning, the term has evolved to signify an inversion of aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through exaggeration and irony. Camp is often mistaken with kitsch and has been described as &quot;cheesy&quot;. In 1964, Susan Sontag&#x27;s essay &quot;Notes on &quot;Camp&quot;&quot; emphasized camp&#x27;s key elements as: &quot;artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess&quot;. In recent years, gay men have sought to disassociate themselves from the term. In a 2018 interview, director Ryan Murphy said he believed camp was &quot;a lazy catchall that gets thrown at gay artists in order to marginalize their ambitions, to frame their work as niche&quot; and preferred to describe his visual aesthetic style as &quot;baroque&quot;. As some gay men have moved away from the term, however, mainstream straight society has appropriated it. In 2019, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted its annual event, the Met Gala, with the theme titled &quot;Notes on Camp&quot;. That same year, the museum presented its full exhibit &quot;Camp: Notes on Fashion&quot;, in which it presented numerous &quot;campy&quot; women&#x27;s dresses. Nevertheless, in drag performances and at gay pride events, many gay men continue to embrace a camp aesthetic.

==Representations of gay men in Western media==

In many forms of popular entertainment, gay men are portrayed stereotypically as promiscuous, flamboyant, flashy, and sassy. Gay men are also rarely the main characters in mainstream films; they frequently play the role of stereotyped supporting characters or are portrayed as either a victim or the villain. Despite the stereotypical depictions of gay men, television shows since the 1990s, such as &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, &quot;Queer Eye&quot;, and &quot;Modern Family&quot; have promoted broader social acceptance of gay men as &quot;normal people&quot;. Nevertheless, gay men are still frequently portrayed in the United States as symbols of social decadence by evangelists and organizations such as Focus on the Family.

===Historical Western media representations===
Historically, many films have included negative sub-texts regarding male homosexuality, such as in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s films, whose villains used implied homosexuality to heighten senses of evil and alienation. In news programming, male homosexuality was rarely directly mentioned, but it was often portrayed as a sickness, perversion, or crime. In 1967, CBC released a news segment on homosexuality; however, the segment was simply a compilation of negative stereotypes of gay men. The 1970s showed an increase in gay men&#x27;s visibility in Western media with the 1972 ABC show &quot;That Certain Summer&quot;. The show was about a gay man raising a family, and although it did not show any explicit relations between the men, it contained no negative stereotypes.

With the emergence of the AIDS epidemic and its explicit associations with gay men, media outlets in the U.S. varied in their coverage, portrayal, and acceptance of gay male communities. The American Family Association, the Coalition for Better Television, and the Moral Majority organized boycotts against advertisers on television programs which showed gay men in a positive light. Media coverage of gay men during the AIDS crisis depended on the location and therefore the local attitudes toward gay men. For example, in the Bay Area, &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; hired an openly gay man as a reporter and ran detailed stories on gay male topics. This was a sharp contrast to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which refused to use the word &quot;gay&quot; in its writing, exclusively referring to gay men and lesbians with the term &quot;homosexuals&quot;, because it was believed to be a more clinical term. The &quot;Times&quot; also limited its verbal and visual coverage of issues pertaining to gay men.

===Contemporary Western media representations===
In the 1980s, the AIDS crisis greatly affected the representation of gay men in American media.

Melanie Kohnen writes that, initially, the news media portrayed AIDS as a disease that affects mainly urban, White gay men; in spite of the fact that most victims of AIDS were gay Black and Hispanic men. However, by the late 1980s it had become undeniable that most of the victims of AIDS were gay men of color, and the media finally came to acknowledge this commonly-known fact. Yet the new coverage maintained the image of White men as heroic leaders in the fight against AIDS; while ignoring the perspectives of the gay men of color. Kohnen attributes this favorable (and unwarranted) representation of White men to white privilege.

During the crisis, American media tended to focus on the &quot;raunchiness&quot; of gay culture, and divided gay men in to two archetypes: &quot;victims&quot; (those affected by HIV) and &quot;villains&quot; (who allegedly spread HIV, deliberately).

The AIDS pandemic delayed positive representations of gay men until the 1990s, when the first positive representations of gay men began to appear in American media. However, most of these gay men were White, masculine, apolitical and never depicted romantically with other men. This new depiction of gay men catered to heterosexual audiences, and did not reflect the true diversity of the LGBT community. 

Scholars have noted that intersectional representations of gay men of color are generally not present on television. Additionally, when television shows do depict gay men of color, they are often less visible, or merely the love interests of a White male character. They have also often depicted as &quot;race neutral&quot;, meaning that their gayness is paramount to all of their other attributes, thus obscuring their ethnic identity.

==Health==
Gay men in the United States are less likely to be overweight or obese compared to their heterosexual counterparts.

===Abuse===
From a very early age, sexual and gender minority identified men are at an increased risk of being physically and sexually abused. Among boys of all sexual orientations, about one in six is sexually abused before they turn sixteen (however, the range of available estimates is far broader). In the United States, it has been estimated that the number of gay men who were sexually abused or molested when they were children is about 20%. Around the world, the sexual abuse of effeminate male children by heterosexual men continues to be a major concern. Writing about his own experience as a feminine boy, the openly-gay Moroccan writer, Abdellah Taïa, wrote in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed: &quot;I knew what happened to boys like me in our impoverished society; they were designated victims, to be used, with everyone&#x27;s blessing, as easy sexual objects by frustrated men.&quot;

Over the course of their adult lives, gay and bisexual men are also at acute risk of experiencing physical and sexual trauma. Approximately 26 percent of gay men and 37 percent of bisexual men experience physical violence, rape, or stalking by an intimate partner, and 40 percent of gay men and 47 percent of bisexual men have experienced sexual violence other than penetrative rape. This combination of suffering from both childhood and adult sexual victimization has significant health effects on gay men&#x27;s communities. Gay and bisexual men who were abused as children have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, higher likelihood of sexual compulsivity, and increased risk of exposure to HIV. Gay men who experience sexual abuse also display lower self-esteem, a distorted sense of self-worth, and difficulty forming healthy emotional relationships. Gay men are less likely than women to seek mental health assistance after experiencing trauma, oftentimes due to social stigma and false beliefs around sexual assault, such as &quot;men cannot be forced to have sex&quot; and &quot;men &quot;become&quot; gay or bisexual because they were sexually abused.&quot;

===Sexual health===

Around the world, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) face significant challenges in terms of their overall sexual health. According to a UNAIDS report, MSM have a &quot;staggering&quot; 27 times higher risk of contracting HIV than other demographic groups, and the highest median prevalence among this population is found in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

New HIV infection rates for MSM vary by region, but according to a 2018 UN report, HIV cases among MSM represent: 57% of all new cases in North America, Central Europe, and Western Europe; 41% of all new cases in Latin America; 25% of all new cases in Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean; 20% of all new cases in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East; and 12% of all new cases in Western and Central Africa.

In countries with diverse racial populations, such as the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, new HIV infections among gay and bisexual men are found disproportionately in working-class and communities of color. In the United States, there are currently full-blown HIV crises amongst gay Chicano and Latino men in the Mexico-U.S. borderlands region, and amongst African American MSM in the South. In the South, Black gay, bisexual, and other MSM account for six out of every 10 new HIV diagnoses amongst all African Americans. In recent years, independent news sources have shown that working-class Black and Latino gay men in the United States still face significant health disparities in these crises; however, in the United States, as in other places around the world, these problems have only worsened as HIV-positive MSM (especially those from already disadvantaged communities) have been severely and disproportionately affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to HIV, young gay, bisexual, and other MSM are also at significantly higher risk for other sexual health-related issues. Because compulsive and condomless sexually-related behaviors are also strongly associated with depression, young MSM (who are disproportionately likely to experience clinical depression) are at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections via unsafe sex. Furthermore, because depression is strongly linked to a history of being sexual abused, the high rate of past childhood sexual trauma among gay men leaves many in the community vulnerable to unhealthy behaviors and practices. As a combination of these complex factors, many gay, bisexual, and MSM have higher rates of STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, and in the United States, account for 83% of all primary and secondary syphilis cases.

===Mental health===

There are significant issues affecting the overall mental health of gay men. In the United States, 29.3 percent of gay and bisexual men report experiencing chronic daily psychological distress. Gay and bisexual men are exposed to significant minority stress, which is the constant exposure to stressors because of their minority identity in society. Familial and social rejection, homophobia, alienation, and isolation can contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and a lack of self-acceptance. These issues have been found to be exacerbated in gay men who have experienced sexual abuse. Even in countries with social and legal protections for gay men, such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, structural societal stigma against homosexual men persists, and discrimination has been shown to have negative effects on the mental health of gay men. In fact, compared to straight men, gay and bisexual men have a higher chance of having both major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Gay and bisexual men are also at greater risk of dying by suicide; they are one of the demographic groups most likely to have tried to commit suicide, as well as to actually die by suicide. Finally, HIV-positive status continues to have a major impact on the mental health of many gay and bisexual men, who fear disclosing their status to employers, friends, and families, particularly if they have not yet come out.

===Incarceration===
====United States====
In 2017, a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law found that in local and county jails, 6.2 percent of all incarcerated men were sexual minorities, including 3.3 percent who identified as gay or bisexual, and 2.9 percent who did not identify as gay or bisexual but reported having had sex with men (MSM). This number was higher amongst men within state and federal prisons, where 5.5 percent identified as gay or bisexual, and an additional 3.8 were MSM. The Williams Institute&#x27;s research team also found that gay and bisexual men received longer and harsher sentences for the same crimes committed compared to heterosexual men. Gay and bisexual men were found to be 2.7 times more likely to receive prison terms exceeding 20 years than straight men, and were more likely to have spent time in solitary confinement while incarcerated: 26.8 of gay and bisexual men had been held in solitary compared to 18.2 of straight men.

Additionally, gay men are at increased risk of rape and sexual abuse while in prison. A report by the international human-rights organization Human Rights Watch found that in U.S. prisons, the rape of incarcerated gay men is often administratively dismissed because of the misconception that any sexual contact involving a gay man and another male is inherently consensual. As a result, rape victims who are known or believed to be gay are sometimes even denied medical treatment or legal recourse, and perpetrators often go unpunished and thus are allowed to continue abusing their victims. According to the activist Andrea Cavanaugh Kern, high rates of sexual assault against prisoners, combined with high rates of HIV infections in prisons, means that incarceration can often be a &quot;life-or-death&quot; issue for gay and bisexual men.

===Homelessness===
For many young gay men and LGBT+ youth around the world, homelessness and housing insecurity are serious issues. In the United States, which has the largest homeless population in the Western world outside of Germany, numerical estimates of housing insecure LGBT youth range from 1.6 million to 2.8 million. In one U.S. national sample, nearly half of houseless LGBT youth reported they had been kicked out of their home because their family had rejected their sexual orientation or identity. For young gay men, the precariousness of unstable housing comes with many dangers; for example, studies have found that young gay men and adolescents were more likely than their straight counterparts to be sexually victimized while homeless. Further, among young gay, bisexual, and other MSM (17–28 years of age) who have experienced homelessness, 60% have been exposed to powder cocaine and MDMA, 41% to hallucinogens, and 20% to heroin. Drug abuse is considered a risk factor for criminal history and later incarceration, and large numbers of young MSM, particularly young men of color, do experience early contact with the juvenile justice system and other forms of institutionalization. Institutionalization can affect gay and bisexual youth&#x27;s later outcomes in life and lead to long-term addiction, reliance on sex work for survival, and prolonged homelessness. Amongst adults, no nationally representative datasets exist yet for measuring the sexual orientation or gender identity of homeless or housing insecure individuals; however, some estimates place the LGBT community at between 20 and 40% of the United States&#x27; homeless populations.

==Community and identity==
===Subcultures===


In North America and Europe, gay men have several subcultures, including Twinks, Bears, Otters, Queens, Jocks, Gaymers, and others. According to scholars, these subcultures, which largely originated as part of a &quot;gay American way of life&quot;, have in some ways become a &quot;global template&quot; for gay culture around the world. In India, where a gay culture is slowly emerging, despite anti-gay &quot;societal values, the caste system, arranged marriages, [and] the high probability of being disinherited for coming out&quot;, some gay men are working to develop a mature and distinct-Indian culture while also adopting aspects of global gay culture. One Indian gay man who identifies as a Bear, stated in an interview, &quot;Because [straight people] see me in chunky rings and bracelets, heavy metal tees riding a Harley Davidson, it doesn&#x27;t fit in with the Indian stereotype of effeminate gay. While I have nothing against being effeminate, not all gay men are so ... Encouraging a bear culture [in India] will see more men feeling comfortable coming out and avoiding the trap of a face-saving heterosexual marriage.&quot;
In Canada, which already has mature urban communities of gay men, some gay artists are working to counter the fact that the social acceptability of a gay subculture is often dependent on how closely it aligns with Western standards of conventional attractiveness. The video artist Mike Wyeld, whose exhibition &quot;LOVED&quot;, showcased the Bear community, stated, &quot;Some of the things that the media&#x27;s obsessed with — obesity, weight loss, body shape, aging — some of these things we have to be happy with. We get bigger, we get older. You can fight it and be miserable or you can accept it and live with the body that you have and love it.&quot; In the United Kingdom, journalists have noted the role mobile apps such as Grindr have played in creating self-segregating subcultures (also called &quot;tribes&quot;) within gay men&#x27;s communities.

===Youth===

Gay adolescents, boys, and young men are a uniquely vulnerable segment of the gay male population. In many countries, identity-issues, bullying, and lack of family acceptance are some of the major concerns facing gay-identified youth. Additionally, gay boys and adolescents around the world are regularly subjected to more extreme forms of violence, including conversion therapy, familial violence, and other forms of physical abuse. These issues have been shown to have detrimental effects on the well-being of gay and bisexual male youth. In the United States, a 2019 report by the CDC found that suicidal ideation amongst gay and bisexual boys and adolescents is as high as 40.4%. According to the CDC, however, parental support can play an important role in bettering health outcomes for gay and bisexual youth, decreasing the likelihood a gay teen will: &quot;Experience depression; attempt suicide; use drugs and alcohol; [or] become infected with sexually transmitted diseases.&quot; For educators, the inclusion of diverse curriculum and the development of peer support venues (such as Queer–Straight Alliances in North America) have been suggested as ways to reduce the frequency and effects of bullying and cyberbullying. Such measures are particularly important for gay and bisexual male students, who, in 2019, were the second most likely group (behind trans students) to have experienced bullying at school (73.9%) and online (30%) in the most recent 30 days, according to research by Sameer Hinduja and Justin Patchin. Despite these calls for inclusive and diverse curriculums, Scotland is currently the only country in the world with a mandated LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum in its public school system. While many nations offer a piecemeal approach to LGBT education, others (including several U.S. states) have explicit bans on the inclusion of gay-friendly education. Despite the challenges gay teenagers face, studies have found that gay male youth also develop skillsets which enable them to more successfully cope with stress and other developmental challenges than their straight peers. In comparing gay boys and adolescents to their heterosexual peers, gay-identified youth show higher levels of resilience, positive self-esteem, and internal self-control.

===Fatherhood===
In the majority of countries today, adoption by same-sex couples is not legally allowed. In Western Europe, most of South America, and North America, however, gay men can became fathers in a variety of ways, including adoption, surrogates, and births from previous relationships. In recent years, prominent gay men such as Anderson Cooper and Elton John have made headlines for becoming fathers, and gay men have been increasingly represented on television as fathers (though these representations have been subject to critiques for their one-dimensionality). In spite of these advances in visibility and representation, however, gay fathers and their families still experience high levels of discrimination and social stigma from their relatives, neighbors, and other members of their communities. In the United States, two-thirds of gay fathers report experiencing social stigma, and one-third report that their children faced stigmatization from other children for having gay parents. Despite widespread social stigma against gay fathers and their children, the vast majority of social scientific research shows the children of gay fathers to be equally well adjusted as the children of heterosexual parents. In fact, in the United Kingdom, researchers have found that the adopted children of gay fathers score lower on levels of anger and parental over-dependence than children adopted by lesbian or heterosexual couples, while also scoring higher on positive coping mechanisms. Additionally, Swiss researchers have found that gay fathers report less irritation when their children display negative emotions than do straight fathers, and gay men show higher levels of warmth and cooperation toward their partners than do straight men.

===Age===
Older gay men are one of the least studied groups within gay men&#x27;s communities. In Mexico, Vida Alegre opened in 2019 as the first senior center for LGBT people in the country. According to the center&#x27;s founder, Samantha Flores, loneliness is a major problem for many older gay men in Mexico, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve had people come in, older gay men, sobbing and pouring their hearts out to me about how unhappy they are ... They usually don&#x27;t have children, and many of their families have disowned them, so they need to turn to families they have chosen themselves or friends for social contact.&quot; According to Flores, many of these older gay men in Mexico are also living with PTSD because of their many lost friends and partners who died during the AIDS epidemic. In France, the documentary filmmaker Sébastien Lifshitz made &quot;Les Invisibles&quot;, a 2012 documentary about elderly gay French people, and he found significant ideological differences between younger and older gay people. Lifshitz stated, &quot;What&#x27;s important to understand is that this older generation of gay people in France fought against the heterosexual, bourgeois model of French society with all their might. The fact that there are much younger gay couples today that are demanding the right to get married and adopt children is something the older gay generation understands, but does not want for themselves.&quot; Finally, in the United States, scholars have found that most older gay American men are not &quot;strange, lonely creatures&quot; but are instead &quot;well-adjusted to their homosexuality and the aging process&quot;.

===Gender identity===
For trans and gender nonconforming gay and bisexual men, there are unique aspects of their identity which shape their experience within gay men&#x27;s communities. In Canada, gay and bisexual trans men often use specific apps and websites, such as Grindr and Tinder, in order to find romantic and sexual partners. Canadian trans men report that personal developments (such as gender transition) and socio-historical changes (like increasing trans male visibility and the rise of virtual dating applications) are producing rapidly changing sexual and romantic opportunities; in fact, in 2017, most gay Canadian trans men reported having satisfying sexual lives. In the United States, scholars report that trans men are often more likely to identify as bisexual than cisgender people. They also note that gay and bisexual trans men in the U.S. report comparable levels of self-esteem, sexual satisfaction, or psychological adjustment to their cisgender peers. In a 2009 interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, the writer Amos Mac, who identifies as queer, said, &quot;I very much [identify] as a fag. I [am] drawn to the community of gay men, and that&#x27;s how I embody myself. I&#x27;m attracted to guys who have a bit of flair to them. They don&#x27;t have to be gay, but they can be queeny. I love an artistic queen.&quot; Mac also stated that living as an LGBT man allows him to express his femme side, since he no longer feels the necessity to force a masc posture in public. In his 2017 book, &quot;Trans Homo&quot;, San Francisco State University professor Avi Ben-Zeev addresses the historical presence of trans gay men within the community, writing, &quot;Elders, like Lou Sullivan, paved the way and have brought some visibility to the fact that trans men are, and have been, an integral part of gay male communities. Yet, we trans homos (and our lovers) are still mysterious creatures to many, even within these communities.&quot; In a 2004 collection of personal essays, one man wrote about his identity formation as a gay trans man, writing &quot;I [never felt] that being gay, or [transgender] was unnatural. I&#x27;ve always felt that the people who never questioned their gender, sexuality, or fertility were the odd ones. If anyone needs an outsider&#x27;s label, it&#x27;s the ones who moralize against human sexuality, not the ones who accept it.&quot;

===Disability===
Disabled gay men represent a significant but under-represented portion of the community. According to the Feinberg School of Medicine, 26 percent of all gay men and 40 percent of bisexual men in the United States have some form of disability. Nevertheless, gay men with disabilities report feelings of discomfort because of social expectations surrounding physical appearance and conventional standards of attractiveness. One man, Aaron Anderson, who has Guillain-Barre Syndrome, said, &quot;Gay men are so conditioned to everything has to be perfect. You have to have it all. [My body] is so not perfect. The gay men I know don&#x27;t know how to deal with it [my disability]. They pretend it&#x27;s not a thing or superficial acquaintances will just ignore me.&quot; Gay men with disabilities also note that members of the disability community often feel desexualized by society. This desexualization can have serious ramifications for the health of gay men with disabilities. Jae Jin Pak, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, noted that accurate sexual education and sexuality-related information is generally unavailable to members of the disabled community, which can leave men in the community without information about safe-sex practices. Meanwhile, within the field of Disability studies, scholars emphasize the importance of establishing a public identity and a common culture for gay men with disabilities. In recent years, queer men with disabilities have achieved some mainstream media visibility, including through Ryan O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s 2019 Netflix series &quot;Special&quot;, and the online popularity of the sexually fluid American model Nyle DiMarco.

== Education ==
In the United States, on average, gay men are almost twice as likely than straight men to disagree that &quot;they feel safe at school&quot;. Despite this, gay men are 50% more likely than straight men to have a university degree, and gay men have a slightly higher high school GPA then straight and bisexual men.

<text>Lorenzo Homar Gelabert (September 10, 1913 – February 16, 2004) was a Puerto Rican printmaker, painter, and calligrapher whose artwork stretches to three main workshops: (CPA), DIVEDCO (), and the of the (ICP). Homar was also the designer of the logo of the (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture).

==Early years==
Lorenzo Homar was born in 1913 in Barrio Puerta de Tierra in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His father, Lorenzo Homar Sr., was a film promoter and his mother, Margarita Gelabert, a pianist. Although he attended grammar school in San Juan, in 1928 due to financial difficulties, his family is forced to move to New York City. Because of the financial situation of his family, Homar did not finish his high school education and went to work in a textile factory. In 1931, he attended New York&#x27;s Art Students League where he learned the art of drawing under the guidance of George Bridgman.

Homar joined the House of Cartier in 1936 in New York as an apprentice designer of jewelry. During this period of his life he studied engraving, drawing and history of design. Furthermore, the income from his position at Cartier allowed Homar to take night classes in painting, design and typography at Pratt Institute.

==World War II==
When the United States entered World War II, Homar joined the Army. He participated in the Pacific Campaign and was wounded in the Philippines for which he received the Purple Heart Medal. Homar then served in an Army Intelligence Unit where he learned cartography while working for the Second Amphibious Combat Engineers Brigade. He also published military sketches in numerous American journals. When he returned from the war, he enrolled in the School of the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1946. While there, he was able to meet and learn from such artists as Ben Shahn, Rufino Tamayo and Gabor Peterdi.

==Early Career in Puerto Rico==
Homar returned to Puerto Rico in 1950, where together with other artists, such as Rafael Tufiño, Felix Rodriguez Baez, Julio Rosado del Valle and René Marqués, he co-founded the &quot;Centro de Arte Puertorriqueño&quot; (Puerto Rican Arts Center, or CAP). He was later named the director of the Graphics Studio of the Graphic Art Division of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Department of Community Education (DivEdCo). This is when he created most of his works of art. Homar designed the logo of the &quot;Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña &quot; (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture) known as the ICP, and he also established the Institute&#x27;s Graphic Arts Workshop. During the decade of the 1960s Homar began use the techniques of graphic printmaking, particularly in silkscreen. In 1975, he established his own printing studio, and among his many works are the posters he designed in 1979, for the VIII Pan American Games.
