<text>Oklahoma City&#x27;s Asia District, also known as the Asian District, is the center of Asian culture and International cuisine and commerce in the state of Oklahoma. It contains the largest population of Asian Americans and descendants from Asia in the state.

Anchored by the Gold Dome and Classen Building at the intersection of Northwest 23rd Street and Classen Boulevard, and bordered by Oklahoma City University to the west and the Paseo Arts District to the east, the Asian district runs north along Classen Boulevard in central Oklahoma City from roughly Northwest 22nd Street up to Northwest 32nd Street.

The famous landmark &quot;Milk Bottle Grocery&quot; (built in 1910) is situated on Classen Boulevard and unofficially marks the entrance to the district. Scores of restaurants, travel outlets, international video stores, retail boutiques, nightclubs, supermarkets, and Asian-oriented service outlets appeal to Oklahoma City&#x27;s large Asian populace and tourists alike.

==History==
Before the area became known for its predominant Asian culture, the area surrounding Oklahoma City University between Classen and 23rd Street was incredibly high in crime and was at one point known as one of the most concentrated Crip neighborhoods in the central United States. Crime in the area began to die down in the mid 1990&#x27;s, as both the expansion of Oklahoma City University and the influx of Vietnamese families began to push gang activity out of the area.

&quot;Little Saigon&quot; in the current area was first coined in 1975 when thousands of Vietnamese refugees came to Oklahoma City after the fall of Saigon.

The Vietnamese population has continued to grow since the first wave of immigrants landed just across the state line in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. Relatives and friends joined them in Oklahoma City as stories of success reached the homeland in Vietnam, causing the population to grow significantly. The original refugees made Oklahoma City their home thanks to a handful of activists who brought hundreds out of the camp. Each refugee had to have an American sponsor before leaving the Arkansas barracks. The first refugees, most of whom did not speak English, left professional and military careers in Vietnam to become laborers such as brickmakers, builders, and warehouse workers in Oklahoma City. In time, many in the community became lawyers, doctors, and engineers, and started businesses in the Little Saigon portion of Asia District. They opened dental and chiropractor offices, nail salons, and insurance agencies in the area.

Immigrants also created a local chapter of the Vietnamese-American Association and the Vietnamese Buddhist Association, which recently broke ground on a new temple in Asia District.

===Old Chinatown, Oklahoma City===

The &quot;Little Saigon&quot;-influenced Asia District in North Central Oklahoma City is not the first Asian enclave in the central Oklahoma area, as the city once had an original historic Chinatown underground in Downtown Oklahoma City. Artifacts were discovered in 1969 when excavation occurred for the Myriad Convention Center within the blocks bordered by Sheridan (Grand) Avenue, EK Gaylord Boulevard, Reno Avenue, and Robinson Avenue.

Oklahoma City&#x27;s Historic Chinatown consisted of a tunnel system underneath buildings and streets in downtown, centered in the vicinity of Main Street and Grand Avenue (now Sheridan) toward Broadway and Robinson Avenues, the extent of which is unknown and likely lost forever.

<text>The 5th Battle Squadron was a squadron of the British Royal Navy consisting of battleships. The 5th Battle Squadron was initially part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Second Fleet. During the First World War, the Home Fleet was renamed the Grand Fleet.

==History==
===First World War===
====August 1914====
In August 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was based at Portland, and consisted of a number of pre-dreadnought battleships. These were:
* 
* 
* 
* 

Following the loss of HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; in 1914, and were transferred from the 6th Battle Squadron. With the commissioning of the five fast battleships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class, the remaining pre-dreadnoughts were sent to the Mediterranean. herself was delayed in joining the squadron, instead taking part in the Dardanelles Campaign until May 1915.

====Battle of Jutland====
In 1916, the 5th Battle Squadron—under the command of Rear Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas— was temporarily transferred to David Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet. On 31 May, four ships of the Squadron served with distinction in the battle of Jutland. These were:

* Flagship of Rear Admiral H. Evan-Thomas; Captain A. W. Craig;
* Captain M. Woollcombe;
* Captain E. M. Philpotts;
* Captain the Honourable A. D. E. H. Boyle;

In the clash with the German I Scouting Group under Admiral Franz von Hipper, the 5th Battle Squadron &quot;fired with extraordinary rapidity and accuracy&quot; (according to Reinhard Scheer), damaging the battlecruisers and and a number of other German warships.

Three of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s received hits from German warships during the engagement, yet they all returned home, though &quot;Warspite&quot;—whose steering was jammed—was targeted by the German line, taking 15 hits.

After the battle, HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;—which had missed the battle due to being in dock—rejoined the squadron.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, colloquially known as the G-Wagon or G-Wagen (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen), is a four-wheel drive luxury SUV manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Graz, Styria, Austria, and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line. In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.

The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature. Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler&#x27;s history, with a span of years. Only the Unimog surpasses it. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz introduced the second-generation W463 with heavily revised chassis, powertrain, body, and interior. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to launch a smaller version of the G-Class, named &quot;little G&quot;—though no definitive date was given for the launch.

The 400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020. The success of the second-generation W463 led to the 500,000th unit milestone three years later in April 2023. The 500,000th model was a special one-off model with agave green paintwork, black front end, and amber turn signal indicators in tribute to the iconic 1979 press release photo of a jumping W460 240 GD.

== History ==


The G-class was developed as a military vehicle from a suggestion by the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to Mercedes and was later offered as a civilian vehicle in 1979. In this military role the vehicle was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Wolf&quot;. The Peugeot P4 was a variant made under licence in France with a Peugeot engine. The first military in the world to use it was the Argentine Army (Ejército Argentino) beginning in 1981 with the military model 461, at least one of these was captured in the Falklands and subsequently served with the Royal Air Force.

The development of the G-Class started in 1972 with a cooperative agreement between Daimler-Benz and Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Graz, Austria. Mercedes-Benz engineers in Stuttgart were in charge of design and testing, while the team in Graz developed the production plans. The first wooden model was presented to Daimler-Benz management in 1973, with the first drivable prototype beginning various testing including German coalfields, the Sahara Desert, and the Arctic Circle in 1974. Construction commenced on a new production facility in Graz, where the new cross-country vehicle would be assembled nearly entirely by hand in 1975, with production of the &quot;G Model&quot; beginning in Graz in 1979. In 1980, the Vatican took delivery of a specially made G-Wagen outfitted with a clear thermoplastic top which served as the Popemobile. The &quot;Papa G&quot; later took up permanent residence at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

The first major refinements were introduced in 1981, including an automatic transmission, air conditioning, an auxiliary fuel tank, protective headlamp grilles and a cable winch. Fuel injection became available in 1982, when the 230 GE was introduced in Turin, along with more comfortable and supportive front seats, auxiliary heating, wider tires and fender flares. For 1985, differential locks, central door locking and a tachometer became standard and by 1986 over 50,000 G Models had been produced.

The G-Wagen was facelifted in 1990. In 1989, for the 10th anniversary of the G Model, a new model variant with permanent 4-wheel drive, a wood-trimmed interior and optional Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) debuted at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. Production began the following April. For 1992, production began on a new sub-series for professional users. The civilian model began to offer cruise control, a stainless-steel spare-tire cover, running boards and Burl Walnut wood interior trim. In the same year, the 100,000th G Model was built in Graz and in 1994, the model line was officially renamed the G-Class. Ventilated front disc brakes and a driver&#x27;s air bag became standard. In 1996 the automatic transmission became an electronically controlled 5-speed unit and headlamp washers, cruise control, and a front passenger&#x27;s air bag were added. In 1998, the range-topping G 500 with a 296 hp V8 was introduced for series production.

For 1999 a limited run of V8 powered &quot;G 500 Classic&quot; special editions marked the model&#x27;s 20th anniversary. A multifunction steering wheel was added to all models. Later in the year, the new G 55 AMG debuted as the most powerful G-Class yet, with 354 hp. The U.S. market launch of the G-Class took place in 2001. New alloy wheels, a chrome grille and body-colour bumpers plus a more luxurious cabin were introduced. New dynamic control systems included the Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Brake Assist, and the 4 wheel Electronic Traction System (4 ETS). The G 55 AMG was upgraded in 2004 with a supercharged V8 engine developing 476 hp.

In 2006, a documentary filmmaker was the first foreigner to reach Siberia, the world&#x27;s coldest region, with a passenger vehicle in winter, driving a stock G 500 nearly 19,000 km without a single breakdown, in temperatures as frigid as −63˚F/-53 °C.

==W460 (1979–1991)==
The W460 was introduced at a press event held at the off-road proving ground in Toulon, France, and went on sale in September 1979 with three engine choices and five body variants. Over the next decade, the engine and transmission choices were expanded or updated along with more and more optional extra cost creature comforts (air conditioning, automatic transmission, power windows, etc.).

The G-Wagen gained its global fame in 1980 when Mercedes-Benz built a Popemobile based on 230 G cabriolet during the first visit of Pope John Paul II in Germany.

Mercedes-Benz never officially exported the G-Wagen to the United States because it was considered more of a utilitarian vehicle and didn&#x27;t fit the American perception of what Mercedes-Benz was. During the 1980s, the grey import specialists brought the W460 to the United States and modified them to meet the US regulations. In 1988, the new federal law, Motor Vehicle Safety Compliance Act, closed the loopholes and tightened up the regulations for grey imports, making it more difficult and more expensive for the registered importers to federalise the W460 in a very small number. The other issue was severely underpowered engines in the 230 GE, 280 GE, and 300 GD models might not have appealed to the American market as was the case with the Mercedes-Benz 380 SEL in the early 1980s.

The 200 GE was built specifically for Italian markets and other markets where a heavy tax penalty was incurred for engines larger than 2 litres. The 300 GD was the most popular model while the 280 GE was the most powerful. Despite the availability of turbocharged diesel engines in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles, one was never fitted to the W460.

The rarest W460 variants were the 230 GE 2.6 Brabus (1989–?), the 280 GE AMG, and the 560 GE (1993). Brabus increased the engine displacement of the 2.3-litre four-cylinder inline engine to 2.6 litres, increasing the power to . AMG modified the 2.8-litre six-cylinder inline petrol engine for more power, . Only two units of the 560 GE were built in 1993 as part of a feasibility study that resulted in a limited series of the W463 500 GE for 1993–1994 and the W463 G 500 from 1998 on.

===Derivations===

====G-Wagen W462 ELBO (1988–?)====
This version was assembled from Complete Knock Down (CKD) by ELBO, formerly a Steyr-Daimler-Puch branch division, in Thessaloniki, Greece for the Greek Army. Additionally, the CKD was also assembled at Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s Aksaray plant in Turkey. The engine options were a 2.3-litre four-cylinder inline petrol and later a 2.9-litre five-cylinder inline diesel.

====Peugeot P4 VLTT (1981–1988)====

The W460 was assembled in France under licence by Peugeot for the French Army with Peugeot engine and transmission from the 504 and 604 respectively as well as its own seats and wiring system. The front differential gear lock was omitted because Peugeot used its own axles. They are easily identified by rectangular headlamps.

====Puch G (1979–2000)====
An agreement between Daimler-Benz AG and Steyr-Daimler-Puch stipulated that G-Wagens sold in Austria, Switzerland, Yugoslavia (and its successor states: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia), Mongolia, and Eastern European COMECON countries were called Puch G and elsewhere as Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen/G-Class. The reason for the different branding was due to Puch&#x27;s reputation for its all-terrain vehicles, the Haflinger and Pinzgauer. Since the agreement expired in 2000, consumers could order a retrofit kit from Magna&#x27;s Puch Competence Centre to replace the Mercedes-Benz brands with Puch emblems.

For Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Austria in 1983, Puch emblems was used on the Popemobile instead.

===Engines===
==W461 (1992–2022)==
After the new W463 was introduced in 1989 with an extensively updated chassis and a revised front end, the production of the W460 ended in 1991 and was replaced by the W461. The W461 has essentially the same chassis as the W460 but with the powertrain of the W463 and the body of the W460. While the W463 is aimed at consumers who seek more creature comforts and better driving dynamics, the W461 is built specifically for military, public authorities, and non-governmental organisations. That included the 24-Volt electrical system for the W461.

During the 1990s, the W461 was offered with a 2.3-litre four inline petrol engine and a 2.9-litre five inline diesel engine from 1992 to 2001. From 2001 to 2014, the W461 model for military and public authorities was offered with a 2.7-litre inline five turbodiesel engine and later with a 3.0-litre V6 turbodiesel engine. They were called G 270 CDI Worker (2001–2006) and G 280 CDI Worker (2007–2009) respectively.

On 1 October 2021, Mercedes-Benz announced a new variation of W461 called W464.

===Civilian Editions===

Over the years, Mercedes-Benz had introduced the civilian version of the W461, built in limited numbers and for a limited period of time. They targeted primarily the consumers who wanted the &quot;stripped down&quot; version and did not need the creature comforts. The engine choice was often limited to one type, namely a diesel engine, per series. Those editions were named PUR or Professional.

====EDITION.30 PUR====
In 2009, Mercedes-Benz, celebrating the 30-year anniversary of the G-Class, introduced the G 280 CDI EDITION.30 PUR as a five-door long wheelbase station wagon. The consumers could order theirs with &quot;Off-Road Package 1&quot; or &quot;Off-Road Package 2&quot;. The passenger compartment had four seats upholstered in hard-wearing fabric or vinyl, rubber floor coverings, spray-protected/water-resistant controls, drainage apertures in the footwells, and a wood floor in the load compartment with load lashing lugs and rails. The dashboard received a new instrument cluster from the W463 and dual air bags and the climate control remained manually operated as did the window winders and locks. The exterior received flexible wheel arch flaring, protective grilles for headlamps, taillamps, front turn signal indicators, a walk-on hood/bonnet for easy access to the optional roof rack, a towing lug attached to the front bumper and two-section barn doors at the rear.

====Professional====
The success of the limited series &quot;EDITION.30 PUR&quot; led to the G 280 CDI Professional in 2009 and its successor, the G 300 CDI Professional, in 2010. Initially the 280 CDI Professional was limited to a five-door long wheelbase station wagon design before the body variants were expanded to five different body variations: a three-door long wheelbase panel van (Kastenwagen in German), a five-door long wheelbase station wagon, a two-door cabriolet and a two or four-door cab chassis truck (Pritschenwagen in German) for the G 300 CDI Professional. The production of the civilian variant continued through 2019. However, the military variant continued through 2022 when it was replaced by the new W464 model.

===Engines===
==W463, first generation (1990–2018) ==
For 1990, the W460 was extensively revised, and a new chassis number, W463, was assigned. The W463 moved the G-Class from spartan and utilitarian to a luxury model on par with the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and the luxurious Range Rover. Thus, no three-door panel vans in short and long wheelbase lengths or barn doors in the rear were offered for the W463: those features are exclusive to the W461. The W461 continued in production as military and utilitarian vehicles for the government agencies and non-government organisations.

The exterior was revised to smoothen out the front end and the front fenders/wings were vertically flattened out at the front underneath headlamps. The fender flares and front end (cooling grille and headlamp bezels) were painted in body colour. The headlamps have square and slightly recessed bezels whilst the grille is narrower to give space for the front numberplate attached to the top of the bumper. The front bumpers are form-fitted and have integrated fog lamps while the rear bumpers have the integrated red rear fog lamp and white reversing lamp. The fuel filler is now covered by a panel. The side running boards were given a standard fitment. The external rear view mirrors have a new housing that pivots on anchors attached to the front doors. New revised tail lamps without white reversing lamps were fitted in the rear.

The interior was significantly updated with wood trim and leather upholstery for the first time. The centre console is smoother and better integrated with the dashboard and the lower part of the dashboard is covered with rubber pads for better knee protection in the event of a frontal collision. The electric differential lock switches are placed prominently in the middle of the dashboard with other electric switches and the instrument cluster has a smoother and more curved housing that meets the dashboard fluidly. The gauges are integrated into one panel rather than a few separate gauges attached to the instrument cluster. The climate control panel was revised to include the temperature and fan speed dials and the door panels are fully trimmed with ruffled leather paneling and soft paddings. The seats are more plush and have several defined cushions along with lumbar support.

The new features included ABS and full-time four-wheel-drive with electrically locking differentials. The engines were carried over from the W460/W461, including the 200 GE, 230 GE, and 300 GE models for petrol engines along with the 250 GD and 300 GD for diesel engines. In 1994, the Geländewagen was renamed as the G-Class when model names were revised to reflect the new corporate nomenclature.

When Mercedes-Benz didn&#x27;t consider selling the G-Class in the United States, a small registered importer based in New Mexico, Europa International, Inc., began the expensive process of certifying and modifying the G-Class for the US market and started selling them in 1993. When the new G 500 was introduced in 1998, Europa International sought and received the &quot;small-volume manufacturer status&quot;, allowing the company to be the exclusive importer and distributor of the G 500 in the United States. The sales success of the G 500 was attributed to Europa International&#x27;s clever marketing toward high-end luxury clientele and led Mercedes-Benz to the decision of purchasing the distribution rights and including the G-Class in its official US model ranges.

The first generation W463 had the widest range of engines ever fitted to a Mercedes-Benz vehicle during its entire 28-year model run: from four to twelve cylinders; and from natural aspiration to supercharger, turbo, and twin turbo. Towards the end of the first-generation model run the W463 had the highest number of paint colour options at 22, including the bright and intense colours of the Crazy Color Edition.

===Models===
The W463 had the highest number of body variations and derivations of any post-war Mercedes-Benz:
* two-door cabriolet
* three-door station wagon with short wheelbase
* four-door pickup truck with six wheels (Mercedes-AMG G 63 6x6)
* four-door cabriolet with extended wheelbase (Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet)
* five-door station wagon with long wheelbase
* five-door station wagon with extended wheelbase (custom built by AMG)
* five-door station wagon with long wheelbase and widened track (Mercedes-Benz G 500 4x4²)

===Special models and special editions===

====500 GE V8 (1993)====
Mercedes-Benz premiered a special edition of G-Class with its first-ever V8 engine at 1993 Geneva International Motor Show. The 500 GE V8 was available in 5-door, long wheelbase station wagon and for one year, 1993, only.

The completed body and chassis were shipped from Graz, Austria to AMG engineering centre in Affalterbach where the chassis was modified to accept the M117 V8 engine and beefed up for extra weight and performance. The V8 engine developed and , providing the acceleration from 0 to in 11.4 seconds and the top speed of .

A special paint finish, Amethyst Blue Metallic, is exclusive to 500 GE V8 and is not available to any other Mercedes-Benz models. The paint finish is extended to the cooling grille, bumpers, mirror housings, and fender flares. The interior is trimmed with black leather containing the contrasting element in medium grey colour, including the steering wheel. The walnut veneer was fitted to the centre console, part of the handbrake lever, the two transmission selector levers, and trim elements on the door cards.

To reflect the exclusivity and higher price, the 500 GE V8 is luxuriously appointed with many accessories as standard equipment: air conditioning, automatic gearbox, cruise control, sliding sunroof, heated seats, power central locking system, electric window winders, and like.

The retail price for the 500 GE V8 was DM 178,250 ($107,381 US at 1993 currency exchange rate and $223,138 US (2022, adjusted)). To put the price in perspectives, a 1993 300 GE (the top-of-line G-Class in a regular production) was DM 88,500, and a 1993 W140 500 SE with M119 V8 engine was DM 129,030.

The production was initially to be limited to 500 units, signifying the &quot;500&quot; in model name: 446 units were actually produced and sold. Mercedes-Benz had a remaining batch of 446 M117 V8 engines when the next-generation M119 production started for W140 S-Class. The wider M119 engine could not fit the engine compartment in G-Class. The V8 engine option for G-Class was reintroduced in 1998 when the G 500 with M113 V8 engine entered into a regular production.

A Puch 500 GE V8 was offered as well: only three units were produced.

AMG offered the performance upgrade kit for 500 GE V8 with 6-litre displacement: 500 GE V8 6.0 AMG. The upgrade kit offers the higher output (), higher top speed () and quicker acceleration (10.4 seconds to 100 km/h from zero). 13 units of 500 GE V8 received the upgrade kit.

==== G 500 Classic Special-Edition (1999) ====
In 1999, the luxuriously equipped G 500 Classic Special-Edition model was unveiled to mark the 20th anniversary of the Mercedes-Benz G-Class. All Classic Special-Edition models were equipped with the 500 V8 engine, all of them received a special Almandinschwarz-Metallic (182) paintwork, which in certain lighting conditions looks black or dark aubergine purple. This limited series design inherited everything from the original classic G-Class, but benefited from the technical developments of the new generation released in 2000. All Classic Special-Edition G-Class receive unique 18&quot; alloy wheels painted in body color inside, with exterior elements painted in vehicle color, Classic inscription strip on the side of the vehicle, stainless steel and painted spare wheel cover, new instrument cluster, equipped with Becker navigation and Hi-Fi with a multi-functional steering wheel appearing for the first time, ultrasonic reversing assist, front and rear seat heating, anti-theft alarm system, illuminated thresholds. The interior is made of black and aubergine purple Nappa leather, with black suede carpets embroidered with Classic lettering and fine burr walnut interior elements. A total of 500 Classic Special-Editions of all versions were produced, 6 in RHD configuration and 494 in LHD configuration, with the majority being long-wheelbase models and only 12 Cabrio models (the rarest G-Class Cabrio model ever produced until the end of production of the G-Class Cabrio in 2014).

====Grand Edition (2005)====
The 500 units of the G 500 and G 55 AMG Grand Edition were built and shipped to the United States when Mercedes-Benz decided to end the sales of G-Class in the United States for 2006 before rescinding its decision. The exterior had an exclusive Allanite Grey Magno metallic paint finish and brushed aluminium trim stripes with &quot;Grand Edition&quot; lettering. The interior had matte-silk wood trim on the dashboard and centre console, designo exclusive leather upholstery, and door sills with illuminated &quot;Grand Edition&quot; lettering.

====G 500 Guard (2009–2018)====
An armoured version of the long wheelbase G 500 five-door station wagon with bullet resistance level FB6 or FB7.

====G-Class LIMITED.30 (2009)====
The LIMITED.30 model is a special edition, celebrating the 30-year anniversary of the G-model (1979–2009). This edition includes designo platinum black paint finish, specially designed light-alloy wheels and EDITION30 lettering on the wings. The interior has designo leather in the colour &quot;chablis&quot; and designo trim in anthracite poplar wood.

====G 55 AMG KOMPRESSOR &quot;Edition 79&quot; (2009)====
Like the LIMITED.30 special edition, the &quot;Edition 79&quot; is exclusive to the Middle East market, celebrating the sales launch in 1979. This edition includes designo magno alanite grey paint finish, a crash bar at the front, carbon fibre side trim stripes, 19-inch AMG wheels with titanium finish, chrome protection grilles for the front turn signal indicators, designo leather upholstery in black/sand colour, a carbon fibre dashboard and centre console trims and an edition logo, e.g. &quot;1 out of 79&quot;, placed in front of the gear selector. The vehicle was unveiled in 2009 at the Dubai International Motor Show.

====BA3 Final Edition and Edition Selection (2011)====
The BA3 Final Edition was launched in 2011 to mark the final production run of the three-door, short wheelbase station wagon. The single model variation was G 350 CDI BlueTEC. This farewell special is distinguished by body-coloured AMG flared wheel arches with 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, carbon optics stripes, an AMG radiator grille, 18-inch alloys, extra chrome trims inside and outside, black leather interior offset by walnut burr veneers and ambient lighting.

At the same time, Mercedes-Benz offered the &quot;Edition Select&quot; special for the five-door model, G 500. Edition Selection applies the same special edition treatment to the G 500/G 550 even though the five-door long wheelbase station wagon would continue for several more years.

====G 55 AMG long &quot;mastermind&quot; Limited (2012)====
As a brand awareness collaboration for the Fashion Week, Mercedes-Benz Japan and mastermind JAPAN built five units for the Japanese market. Externally, the chrome trims and wheels were done in black paint finish, and two stickers were affixed to the side panels at the rear. The mastermind JAPAN skull and bone badges were affixed to the headrests and spare wheel cover. The interior was done in black leather trim with the roof liner finished in light grey Alcantara.

====G 550 Night Edition (2013–2015)====
Exclusive to the Japanese market, 100 units of the G 550 Night Edition were produced with a black paint finish, AMG badges on the front fenders/wings and five twin-spoke, aluminium wheels finished in titanium grey. Two choices of interior colours were offered: porcelain white (60 units) and classic red (40 units). The dashboard and centre console were trimmed with designo piano lacquer black wood. The roof liner was Alcantara in anthracite colour. The sales price was ¥13,900,000 JPY.

====G-Class Cabriolet &quot;Final Edition 200&quot; (2013–2014)====
To commemorate the production end of the two-door cabriolet, Mercedes-Benz introduced the &quot;Final Edition 200&quot; with the G 500 being the only model variation. All of the 200 units had been sold out prior to its premiere at 2013 Frankfurt Auto Show. Externally, the soft top and tonneau cover are beige in colour, the grille is chrome-coloured, and the 5-spoke light-alloy wheels are painted in titanium grey. The B-pillars are fitted with &quot;Final Edition 200&quot; badges. The interior received designo leather seats and door panels coloured in ecru with black trim, satin-finished light brown poplar wood trim, and an AMG performance steering wheel.

====G 500 4×4²====
Continuing with the G 63 AMG 6×6 formula, Mercedes-Benz introduced the G 500 4×4², using the body of the long wheelbase 5-door station wagon on a shortened chassis from the G 63 AMG 6×6. The G500 4×4², along with the G 500/G 550, received a new 4.0-litre biturbo V8 (M176), producing . The exterior is the same as the Mercedes-AMG G 63 and G 65 despite the G 500 4×4² not being a Mercedes-AMG edition.

====Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet (2017)====
Following the success of the G 63 AMG 6×6 and G 500 4×4², Mercedes-Benz introduced the first SUV under the sub-brand name Mercedes-Maybach at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2017. G 650 Landaulet used the extended chassis with the portal axles and raised suspension system from the G 500 4×4². The rear end of the G 650 Landaulet was built from the rear part of the W463 cabriolet with a folding fabric roof covering the rear half of the body behind the B-pillar. The rear passenger doors with no wheel-opening cut-out were from the G 55 with extended wheelbase (2001). The front end is from the Mercedes-AMG G 65 with more chrome trims. The light alloy wheels and extendable side running boards are chrome plated. The powertrain is from the G 65 with the biturbo V12.

The interior is finished in ultimate luxury as found in Mercedes-Maybach GLS-Class and S-Class. Like the original Maybach 62 Landaulet, a division wall is installed behind the driver and front passenger. The second row seats are moved further back from the rear passenger doors and are the same rear seats as used in the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class. A second control panel and centre console is installed behind the division wall toward the rear. The dashboard above the second set is one set of the two front passenger&#x27;s dashboards with a glove box and hold two large LED monitors.

The sales price was €749,700, and the production was limited to 99 units.

===AMG models===

====500 GE 6.0 AMG (1993–1995)====
For the first time, an AMG version of the G-Class was offered in 1993 with the 500 GE 6.0 AMG. The M 117.965 E 50 engine was bored from 5 to 6 litres, producing and . The increased output did not make the 500 GE 6.0 AMG much faster with a time of 10.9 seconds for 0–. Only thirteen units were built and it was available in long wheelbase form only.

====G 36 AMG (1994–1997)====
After AMG entered into co-operation with Mercedes-Benz in 1993, the G 36 AMG was introduced and fitted with the M104.992, the same engine as found in the C 36 AMG and E 36 AMG.

====G 43 AMG (1997–1998)====
A total of 38 units of the G 43 AMG were produced between 1997 and 1998, all of them were special orders with country code &quot;293 Company Vehicle&quot;, mostly for VIPs and probably secret services. Six of them bore 463.233 chassis numbers, as though they were G 320 LWBs that had their V6 engine replaced with a type M113.982 V8 engine. Bizarrely, the remaining 32 units were coded 463.241, meaning that they were meaning to be G 500 LWB that had the M113.982 AMG 4.3-litre engine fitted in lieu of the M113.962 standard 5-litre engine.

Ten G 43 AMG were produced for the Japanese market.

====G 63 AMG V12 (2002)====
The G 63 AMG V12 was a very limited production run with only five units built in 2002. It was the first G-Class with a V12 engine before Mercedes-AMG officially introduced the more powerful G 63 AMG. The engine produced and propelled the G 63 AMG to in 6.5 seconds.

====G 55 AMG (2002–2003) and G 55 AMG Kompressor (2004–2012)====

Citing the sales success of the G 500 in the United States and the absorption of AMG into DaimlerChrysler AG, Mercedes-Benz began to expand the AMG versions to several models, including the G-Class. To coincide with the official launch of the G-Class in the United States, Mercedes-Benz introduced the 55 AMG along with the G 500 in 2001 for the 2002 model year. The G 55 AMG visually did not differ from the G 500 other than side exhaust pipes, wider tyres, AMG five-spoke wheels, chrome tip at bottom of front bumper, and AMG lettering in the rear. The G 55 AMG became the favourite of celebrities and the wealthy.

For the 2005 model year, AMG revised the G 55 AMG by adding a supercharger to the 5.4-litre V8 engine, increasing the output to .

In 2009, to differentiate the G 55 AMG KOMPRESSOR from the G 500 visually, AMG changed the radiator grille to three thick fins, added the embossed metal KOMPRESSOR lettering underneath the V8 badge on the front fenders/wings, and introduced new light-alloy wheels in titanium grey and three new metallic paint colours (Calcite White, Periclase Green, and Teallite Blue). The 0– acceleration was reduced from 7.4 to 5.6 seconds. Yet, the top speed remained at . The engine was upgraded again for 2006 (2007MY in USA) to then again to for 2008 (2009MY in USA).

====G 63 AMG (2012–2018) ====

The supercharged 5.4-litre V8 was replaced by the new 5.5-litre biturbo V8 for 2012 (2013MY in USA) for better fuel consumption and lower emissions. AMG made some more changes to the exterior to give the G 63 AMG a more &quot;brawly&quot; appearance: single horizontal fin with twin chrome edges in the middle of the radiator grille with a more prominent three-pointed star ornament in the middle, a new light-alloy wheel design, three enlarged airflow inlets on both sides and in the middle of the front bumper, vertical chrome strips to cover the small bumper guards and exterior rear-view mirrors from the GL-Class and ML-Class. The mechanical upgrade was an AMG sports exhaust system with high-gloss chrome inserts, larger AMG high performance brakes with six-piston fixed calipers at the front from the ML 63 AMG and revised suspension and damper settings for more dynamic handling characteristics. The new E-SELECT gear selector from the Mercedes-Benz SLS replaced the standard gear selector.

For 2016, the name was changed to Mercedes-AMG G 63.

====G 65 AMG (2012–2018)====

The G 63 AMG V12, built in 2002, demonstrated the feasibility of installing a V12 engine in the G-Class. The new G 65 AMG was introduced at the same time as the G 63 AMG V8, making the G 65 AMG the third passenger SUV to have a V12 engine with Lamborghini LM002 (built from 1986 to 1993) being the first one. G 65 AMG was equipped as the G 63 AMG other than minor cosmetic differences with V12 BITURBO badges on the front fenders/wings, floor mats and seat backs.

Like the G 63, the name was changed to Mercedes-AMG G 65 for 2016.

====G 63 AMG 6×6 (2013–2015)====

To mark the thirtieth anniversary of G-Wagen production, Mercedes-Benz introduced the new stretched version with six-wheel-drive system and portal axles. The G 63 AMG 6×6 was derived from a model developed specifically for the Australian Army in 2007. Despite the heavy weight and large dimensions, the G 63 AMG 6×6 could accelerate to in six seconds and reach a top speed of .

The consumer reception of the G 63 AMG 6×6 was stronger than anticipated, and Mercedes-Benz sold slightly more than 100 units, with the last customer delivery taking place in May 2015.


===Concept cars===

====Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen Light Armoured Patrol Vehicle 6.X CONCEPT (2010)====
It is an armoured patrol vehicle developed with EADS, based on LAPV 5.4. It included a diesel engine, 1.3 tonnes of cargo capacity, a monocoque full steel body, compact wheelbase, modular armour plate and mine deflector plate underneath the floor, adjustable variable lift front and rear coil-over air shock absorbers with a maximum of of ground clearance and hydraulic brakes with four ventilated discs. EADS provided the communication technology: vehicle data recorder system, integrated communication system for UHF or VHF bands, integrated mobile command, control and information system, and jamming system. The vehicle was unveiled in EUROSATORY 2010.

====Ener-G-Force (2012)====
The Ener-G-Force was a concept vehicle in response to the Los Angeles Design Challenge 2012 for a future police car. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2012 LA Auto Show. The concept vehicle was hydrogen-powered with fuel cells generating the electricity to the electric motors inside the wheel hubs. A roof rack contained the water tanks with a hydrogen converter, and the body included a three-panel greenhouse, 20-inch wheels and side skirts illuminating the charge and operation status of energy packs.

===Marketing===
The W463 was positioned in the marketplace as a luxury passenger vehicle to compete with the likes of Bentley. After Mercedes-Benz launched the G-Class in the United States with the G 500 and G 55 AMG models, the G-Class became very popular with celebrities, film stars, and the wealthy. The G-Class has appeared in numerous films, television series, and music videos ever since.

As part of Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s attempt to demonstrate the off-road capability of the G-Class SUV, seven G-Class vehicles took a journey from Halls Creek in Western Australia to Wiluna. However, shock absorbers on six of the vehicles (5 civilian G 350s and 1 military model) were broken during their trip on the corrugations of the Canning Stock Route on day 7. Mercedes-Benz Australia later arranged for the replacement shock absorbers to land in Perth, before transferring to a light plane destined for a remote Aboriginal settlement close to Well 33, about 1000 km from Wiluna. The parts would be delivered by the sole surviving vehicle, a G-Professional.

===End of production debacle and revised decisions===
Mercedes-Benz announced that 2005 would be the final year of the G-Class to be sold in the United States, citing the new GL-Class as its successor. The 500 units of G 500 and G 55 AMG Grand Edition were built and shipped to the United States. However, an unexpected order placed by the U.S. Marine Corps for 157 Interim Fast Attack Vehicle (IFAV) based on the G-Class, replacing its ageing, slow, and cumbersome Desert Patrol Vehicles, caused Mercedes-Benz to rescind its decision and to continue offering the G-Class in the United States.

This Grand Edition also led to the rumours of the end of production of the W463 in 2006. A few factors contributed to the rumours: the increasing difficulties in meeting the newer and stricter safety and emission regulations, especially the new EU regulations on pedestrian protection; Mercedes-Benz had introduced new GL-Class as an intended successor; and military contracts fulfilled. An outcry among enthusiasts who admired the G-Class for its tremendous off-road potential along with its reputation and cachet showed that a market still existed for such a vehicle. On 11 November 2005, Dieter Zetsche, DaimlerChrysler Board of Management member and head of the Mercedes Car Group, announced that G-Class production would continue. At the Paris Motor Show in September 2006, Mercedes-Benz reiterated that the G-Class would continue to be manufactured through 2015 due to the strong worldwide demand by both civilian and military buyers. Daimler AG extended the manufacturing contract with Magna Steyr to continue producing the W463 until 2017.

In late 2017, the end of production of the first generation W463 was announced with the heavily reengineered and updated successor to be introduced in 2018 for the 2019 model year.

===Updates (1990–2018)===

====1994 update====
The update was minor with the model designation revised to reflect the new nomenclature system and with an enlarged six-cylinder inline petrol engine for the G 320, replacing the G 300. The Italy-only 200 GE/G 200 and 230 GE/G 230 were dropped, marking the end for the G-Class with the four-cylinder inline engine until G 350 was reintroduced for Chinese market in 2020. After the 200 GE/G 200, 230 GE/G 230, and 300 GE/G 300 were dropped in 1994, manual transmission was dropped from the W463 for good. The steering wheel received the driver&#x27;s side airbag.

====1997 update====
The W463 received its mechanical update in 1997. The update included a new power-assisted folding mechanism for its convertible. The engine range was revised with six-cylinder engines shifting from inline to V-form for both petrol and diesel versions. The G 500 was reintroduced with a new V8 petrol engine. The W463 received dual airbags for the driver and the front passenger.

====2002 update====
The external rear-view mirrors were revised with integrated turn signal repeaters and power-assisted mirror control, eliminating the separate turn signal indicators attached to the body. The front and rear turn signal indicators received a clear lens. The newly-revised headlamps for both American and international markets were also given clear glass lenses. The interior was updated with more creature comforts and better control switches. In 2002, Mercedes-Benz officially launched the G-Class in the United States for the first time since its inception in 1979 with the G 500 and G 55 AMG.

====2005 update====
Mercedes-Benz announced the new G55 AMG Kompressor model with a more powerful, supercharged 5.4L V8 engine (code 113.993, or M113K), replacing the naturally aspirated 5.0L V8 engine (113.982, or M113). The G 500 was renamed as G 550 for certain markets (not USA until 2009).

====2006 update====
This minor update revised the engine range with a new 3.0-litre V6 diesel engine in the G 320 CDI, replacing both the G 270 CDI and G 400 CDI. The G 500 and G 55 AMG Kompressor continued unchanged. The G 320 with the petrol engine was dropped, marking the suspension of six-cylinder petrol engines until 2018. The G 55 AMG Kompressor remained as a five-door station wagon while the G 320 CDI and G 500 were offered in three body styles: two-door cabriolet and station wagons with three-door short and five-door long wheelbases.

====2007 update====
Mercedes-Benz showcased a heavily revised 2007 model at the Paris Motor Show in September 2006 with emphasis on an updated interior, engine range, and new safety equipment.

For 2007, the G-Class received its first high-intensity discharge headlamps, reversing camera, and tire pressure monitoring system (the latter two are federally mandated safety equipment for the United States). 2007 G500&#x27;s in the USA start to phase out the 722.6 5spd transmission, and instead start coming with the new 722.9 7spd transmission. The G55(K)&#x27;s still have the 722.6 5spd transmission. The G 500 could be fitted with the sports side exhaust pipes from the G 55 AMG for extra cost. The power output for the G 55 AMG was increased from to .

The interior received a new instrument cluster with four chrome-trimmed round gauges from the C-Class and a new four-spoke multi-function steering wheel with options of full leather cover or combination of leather and wood. The centre console was updated with new control switches for the vehicle&#x27;s functions and a new climate control panel along with new COMAND APS infotainment and navigation system. In conjunction with the reversing camera, COMAND APS displays the rear view and graph representation of distance and width, assisting the driver during reversing maneuvers. The new ARTICO upholstery colour, cognac, was added to black and grey interior colour options.

====2008 update====
The 2008 update included a new radiator grille with three thicker horizontal fins, replacing the previous seven, thinner fins. The COMAND APS infotainment and navigation system was revised with many new or extended functions such as the LINGUATRONIC voice control system, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon Logic 7 surround sound stereo system, TV tuner and a special off-road menu for the G 320 CDI and G 500 model. Heated and ventilated front seats were also offered.

Last year for the G500 in the USA.

====2009 update====
The 2009 G550 replaces the 2008 G500, and gets a new 5.5-litre V8 petrol engine with [mated to the 722.9 7spd transmission], replacing the 5.0-litre that was in the 2008 G500. The new engine will improve the acceleration for the new G550.

The 2009 and 2010 vehicles saw the absence of a trailer hitch making this the first model years since the vehicles inception where no native towing hardware was available on the vehicle.

For the 30th anniversary of production, Mercedes-Benz offered two special anniversary editions. One was the G 500/G 550 with a more opulent interior and exclusive designo leather upholstery along with special decals. Another one was a new utility model, the G 280 CDI Edition 30 PUR, consisting of the W461 chassis with a 3.0-litre V6 turbodiesel engine (OM 642 DE LA red.) and the W463 four-wheel-drive system.

====2011 update====
Last year for the G55(K) [with 722.6 5spd transmission], in the USA.

====2012 update====

After its last major update in 2007, the interior received a completely redesigned instrument panel and centre console adapted from the ML-Class. The COMAND APS touchscreen and control panel were moved up toward the top of the dashboard for easier viewing and operation. The COMAND APS was updated with the MBrace2 telematics system. Additional safety features included DISTRONIC adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, revised PARKTRONIC reverse sensors and rear-view camera and revised ATS4 stability control for improved trailer stabilising functionality.

Externally, the G-Class received the same horizontal bars of LED daytime running lamps underneath the headlamps and the new external side rear-view mirrors as the GL-Class and ML-Class models. The AMG version received a new front bumper with three large air intakes.

The 5.4-litre supercharged V8 [with 722.6 5spd transmission] in the 2011 G55(K) will be replaced by a new 5.5-litre biturbo V8 [with 722.9 7spd transmission] for increased performance on the upcoming 2013 G63. Topping out the G-Class model range was a new G 65 AMG with a 6-litre biturbo V12 petrol engine. Two models were carried over unchanged: the G 350 CDI BlueTEC and G 500/G 550.

====2016 update====
For the 2016 model year, the outgoing M273 5.5-litre naturally aspirated V8 fitted to the G 500/G 550 was replaced by the new M176 4.0-litre biturbo V8 for increased horsepower and torque.

==W463, second generation (2018–2024) ==

The second generation G-Class (W463) was launched on 14 January 2018 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

Compared to its predecessor, the new G-Class has grown 121 millimeters in width, 53 millimeters in length, and the ground clearance has increased by 6 millimeters. The increase in width is for more driving stability, sturdier side impact protection, and more seating comfort. The increased length, especially in the front end, is due to the new 2019 EU pedestrian impact safety regulations: the previous generation did not have enough open space between the car&#x27;s front end and the rigid components beneath for the crumple zone as to mitigate the injury to a pedestrian&#x27;s body.

A major change was with the steering system which was switched from a recirculating ball system to variable-ratio rack-and-pinion with adaptive electric power assistance. The new steering system allows safety and convenience equipment such as active lane-keeping assist, Pre-Safe collision avoidance systems and self-parking capability. The rack-and-pinion steering system does not work with solid front suspension so a change was made to use independent front suspension.

The extensive, ground-up redesign allowed engineers to incorporate more lightweight materials such as high-strength and ultra-high-strength steels and aluminums. In addition, the redesign led to an improved manufacturing process which increased structural rigidity. The gap between the doors and body shell is much narrower than the previous generation. Despite the increased dimensions, the weight has been reduced by about 170 kilograms.

The second generation W463 is similar visually to the first generation, and the chassis code, W463, is still retained rather than W464 as some media outlets erroneously reported. However, only three parts from the previous generation were carried over to the new generation: the headlamp washers, the push-button door handles and the spare wheel cover bolted to the rear tailgate.

The new G 500 (G 550 for select markets) is powered by the 4.0-liter &quot;M176&quot; V8 twin-turbo engine, producing 416 hp and 450 lb⋅ft of torque. It is mated to a nine-speed automatic 9G-Tronic transmission with torque-converter.

For the new diesel variant, the G 350 d was initially released for the 2019 model year, powered by the 2.9-liter &quot;OM656&quot; inline-6 turbocharged diesel engine, producing 282 hp and 443 lb⋅ft of torque. The G 400 d was later introduced for the 2020 model year onwards. The G 400 d features the same &quot;OM656&quot; engine as the G 350 d, but output has been increased to 326 hp and 516 lb⋅ft of torque. Both models are still produced by Mercedes-Benz, however certain markets only sell one of the two.

The redesign also allowed newer safety and collision avoidance equipment from the W222 S-Class to be fitted to the G-Class for the first time. In addition, the updated interior has a new instrument cluster and infotainment system from other Mercedes-Benz models (A-Class (W177) and E-Class (W213)), air vents, steering column-mounted gear selector, multimedia system and control panel on the tunnel console, a higher level of luxury trimming and 64-color ambient lighting. A Burmester surround sound system and a larger dual 12-inch LCD display with smartphone integration (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto) were offered as optional equipment. One design element carried over to the new generation was the front passenger&#x27;s grab bar on the dashboard.

The new G 550 and AMG G 63 went on sale in the United States with a starting price of $149,900 and $188,050 respectively. The G-Class for the US market has the widest range of exterior colors available, totaling 24, of any Mercedes-Benz passenger vehicle.

In September 2020, the G 350 was introduced for the Chinese market to circumvent the heavy taxation on larger engine displacement. It is powered by the 2-litre M264 turbocharged four-cylinder inline petrol engine, producing and of torque. The G 350 is the first G-Class with a four-cylinder inline engine since the previous model, the G 230, was discontinued in 1995.

===Alternative Designation: W463A/W464===

Mercedes-Benz has not explained the reason for retaining the same chassis designation, W463, for its heavily revised G-Class in production since 2018. Some media outlets have erroneously attributed the updated G-Class as W464, which has been assigned to the W461 successor introduced in October 2022.

Some media outlets, owner&#x27;s forums, tuners, and aftermarket part manufacturers designate the G-Class in production since 2018 as W463A as to avoid the confusion between the original W463 (1990–2018) and revised W463. None of the official Mercedes-Benz websites and product information around the world shows W463A.

=== Safety Ratings ===
The second generation W463 is the first G-variant to ever be formally crash tested. No model prior to this has been certified or had its safety equipment tested for crash safety. EURONCAP testing showed overall positive results, with a 90% rating for adult occupants, 83% for child occupants and a 73% rating for pedestrians. The results showed good protection for the head and neck but were let down by disappointing protection for the chest in both frontal impacts. 
===Mercedes-AMG models ===
====G 63====
Alongside the new G 500/G 550, Mercedes-AMG unveiled the new G 63 in March 2018 at the Geneva International Motor Show. The model is powered by the V8 twin-turbo &quot;M177&quot; engine, producing and of torque, an increase of and over the previous generation G 63 AMG. Mercedes-AMG claims a 0-60 mph time of 4.4 seconds and a top speed of 149 mph with the optional Driver&#x27;s Package. The G 63 now defaults to a rear-biased 40:60 torque split versus the 50:50 split of its predecessor.

In addition to the performance increases over the G 500/G 550, the G 63 also features AMG-developed suspension, larger red brake calipers and perforated brake discs, AMG-specific transmission modes, radiator grille, flared wheel arches, striking side pipes on the exhaust system, and wider wheels up to 22-inches in diameter. The model features distinct front and rear fascias and body styling, as well as an AMG-specific interior with a standard AMG Performance steering wheel with flattened bottom.

=====G 63 Edition 1 =====
To commemorate the launch of the second-generation G 63 in 2023, Mercedes-AMG released the Edition 1 special edition at market launch. The special model features Designo Night Black Magno paint with contrasting matte Graphite Grey sports stripes along the vehicle sides, a decorative red stripe on the exterior mirrors, and Night Package featuring gloss black trim and accents. The Edition 1 also features matte black 22-inch forged wheels with red-painted rim flanges and a cross-spoke design, as well as red accents throughout the interior.

=====G 63 Trail Package =====
The optional AMG Trail Package can be specified for the G 63 model only, offering greater off-road capability and styling. The package adds softer settings for the adaptive dampers to enhance off-road driving and maneuverability. 20-inch wheels with five sets of twin spokes and all-terrain tires are part of the package. A black skid plate and mud flaps behind the rear wheels are fitted to the body.

====G 63 4x4² ====
Following the previous generation&#x27;s G 63 AMG 6x6 and G 500/G 550 4x4², Mercedes-AMG introduced the new G 63 4x4² for the second generation iteration in June 2022. The G 63 4x4² features the same &quot;M177&quot; V8 twin-turbo as the G 63 but with output increased to 585 hp from 577 hp, and raised portal axles like the previous generation G 500/G 550 4x4², except now with independent front axles. The model went on sale Fall 2022 for the 2023 model year with a starting price of $350,050 USD.

Compared to the G 63, the G 63 4x4² features a raised height, larger carbon-fiber fenders, 22-inch wheels with 37-inch Pirelli 325/55R22 all-terrain tires, LED light bar, roof rack with carbon-fiber windscreen, carbon-fiber spare tire cover, and rugged styling. With this increase in height, the model offers a ground clearance 4.3 inches over stock at 13.8 inches, wading depth 8.2 inches over stock at 35.8 inches, and 41.3° approach and 36.8° departure angles.

Additionally, compared to the previous generation G 500/G 550 4x4², the wheelbase is increased by 0.9 inch to 113.1 inches, height is increased by 0.8 inch to 88.8 inches, width is increased by 5.4 inches to 82.5 inches, and length is increased by 3.9 inches to 181.1 inches, or 194.5 inches when accounting for the spare tire carrier. Weight is decreased by 379 lbs to 6,315 lbs. Mercedes-Benz claims an estimated 5.0 0-60 mph time.

=== Special models ===

==== G manufaktur (Individualisation Programme) ====
Mercedes-Benz has introduced the bespoke/individualisation programme exclusive for the G-Class: G manufaktur. Similar to the Mercedes-Benz designo programme, buyers can specify different colour and material options. For the exterior, buyers can choose from 26 exclusive G manufaktur paint colours, and the Black Accents covers for the fender flares, roof, front and rear bumpers, external rear-view mirrors, rub stripes, spare wheel cover ring, wheels, side exhaust pipe tips, etc in gloss black paint.

On the passenger grab bar, the G manufaktur brand is etched on the stainless steel trim.

====Stronger Than Time====
To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the G-Class and the 20th anniversary of the G 55 AMG, Mercedes-Benz introduced the Stronger Than Time edition for the G 400 d, G 500, and Mercedes-AMG G 63. For the G 400 d and G 500, the edition is fitted with the AMG Line exterior package, black 20-inch AMG wheels, and stainless steel trim for the running boards, spare wheel cover, and door sills. The puddle lamps display the G-Class logo and Stronger Than Time on the ground. The driver&#x27;s assistance package, LED headlamps, Burmester surround stereo system, and sunroof are added as standard equipment. The G 63 has a dark chrome grille and matte chrome covering the running boards, exhaust outlets, mirror caps, portions of the front and rear bumper, skid plate, and sections of the spare wheel cover. The 22-inch matte black AMG wheels are fitted to the G 63.

Three interior designs can be chosen: black Nappa leather with gold stitching and open-pore black ash wood trim; a mix of Macchiato Beige and Yacht Blue leather with light brown sen wood trim; and Macchiato Beige and Lounge Red with piano black lacquer. The Nappa leather trim covers the roof grab handles and the instrument cluster cover. The two-tone black and Titanium Grey Pearl Nappa leather with carbon fiber trim is exclusive to the G 63 model.

==== Professional Line ====
With the success of &quot;Worker&quot;, &quot;Pur&quot;, and &quot;Professional&quot; variants in the previous W461 generation, Mercedes-Benz introduced the new &quot;Professional Line Exterior&quot; at the IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich. &quot;Professional Line Exterior&quot; is an exterior accessory options that the owners can customise their G-Class vehicles. The options include climbing ladder, roof rack, simpler spare wheel holder, black trims, headlamp protection grill shield, and like. Unlike the previous &quot;Worker&quot;, &quot;Pur&quot;, and &quot;Professional&quot; variants, &quot;Professional Line Exterior&quot; isn&#x27;t a stripped-down utilitarian version of G-Class and based on W461 chassis.

==== Final Edition G 500 V8 (2023) ====
On the 30th anniversary of the first G-Class to be equipped with a V8, the extremely limited production 500 GE V8, Mercedes-Benz made a surprise announcement on 27 June 2023 that the production of the G 500 (G 550 in selected markets) with a V8 engine will end in 2023. The Final Edition G 500 V8 marks the end of the G 500 with a V8 engine from Mercedes-Benz. The high-performance Mercedes-AMG G 63 with a more powerful V8 engine will continue for the foreseeable future.

Production of the Final Edition G 500 V8 is limited to 1,500 units. Three paint colours are offered: metallic obsidian black, Manufaktur opalith white mango, and Manufaktur olive mango. Each colour is limited to 500 units.

===Production End of W463===
Daimler AG announced the production of current W463 generation to be ended in March 2024 with the updated version to be introduced sometime in 2024. The updated version is to have more improvement in aerodynamic and lower fuel consumption along with styling cues from EQG concept car. With six-year production, the second-generation W463 has the shortest production time of all G-Class versions (except the special production of W462). No official information is given yet what nomenclature will be assigned to the updated version: the designation, W465, has been proposed by the media outlet.

===Concept EQG===


On 5 September 2021, Mercedes-Benz previewed Concept EQG, the G-Class concept car with pure electric drive, at IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich. Externally, Concept EQG carries the styling of the second generation G-Class, with updated elements to distinguish the electric variant, such as a square tire cover, extensive additional LED lighting including a LED Black Panel grille, updated front and rear fascias, new 22-inch wheels, and special roof rack. While Mercedes-Benz has not revealed the technical data yet, Concept EQG has four electric motors that are placed closer to the wheels and that can operate independently; the battery packs are 108 kWH. Additionally, a two-speed gearbox allows the gear reductions for the off-road travel. The model names are EQG 560 4MATIC and EQG 580 4MATIC. The production version is confirmed for 2024.

==W464 (2022–present)==
After thirty years in production, the W461 model has been replaced by the second generation G-Class, designated W464 in October 2021 with a new engine, the nine-speed automatic gearbox, and the front end with beefier bumper, larger cooling grille, and updated LED headlamp and daytime running lamp units. The W464 is offered in two body configurations: 5-door Station Wagon (BA06) and 2-door Cab (BA09). Unlike the W463 (2018–2024), the W464 still retains the solid axle for front and rear with front, central, and rear differential locks, spartan interior, 24-volt electrical system, and heavy-duty chassis.

The 2.9-litre six-cylinder inline diesel engine (OM656, unspecified version) is detuned for Euro III-compliance so the low-quality diesel fuel (500 ppm), most common in African and central Asian countries, can be used. The engine has been tested to run 400 hours on diesel fuel with higher sulphur content (3,000 ppm). As result, the engine output is lowered to while retaining the same .

The engine fitted to W464 has a special feature called “Emergency Override Switch” (EOS). When the engine malfunctions due to technical, mechanical, or electrical issues, the emergency mode (limp-home or shutdown) is activated as to protect the engine from damage. If the emergency mode is activated when the military crew is fleeing the dangerous environment, the operator can activate the EOS to override the emergency/protection mode in order to escape to the safety.

==W465 (2024–present)==
The W465 is the new generation of G-Class introduced on 26 March 2024 with three engines carried over from W463 (3-litre petrol and 2.9-litre diesel six inline engines and 4-litre petrol V8). A 4-litre petrol V8 fitted in the G 500/G 550 was not carried over: a 3-litre petrol six inline engine replaced it. Mercedes-AMG G 63 remains the only W465 with V8 petrol engine. The new W465 with petrol and diesel engines are fitted with a 48-volt hybrid system.

A month later on 24 April 2024, the electric version, G 580 with EQ Technology, was introduced. This model was inspired by the Concept EQG and first electric vehicle from Mercedes-Benz not to have a separate EQ model.

<text>The Camino de Santiago (, ; ), or the Way of St. James in English, is a network of pilgrims&#x27; ways or pilgrimages leading to the shrine of the apostle James in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where tradition holds that the remains of the apostle are buried.

As Pope Benedict XVI said, &quot;It is a way sown with so many demonstrations of fervour, repentance, hospitality, art and culture which speak to us eloquently of the spiritual roots of the Old Continent.&quot; Many still follow its routes as a form of spiritual path or retreat for their spiritual growth. It is also popular with hikers, cyclists, and organized tour groups.

Created and established in the beginning of the 9th century following the discovery of the relics of Saint James the Great, the Way of St. James became a major pilgrimage route of medieval Christianity from the 10th century onwards. Following the end of the Granada War in 1492, under the reign of the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, Pope Alexander VI officially declared the Camino de Santiago to be one of the &quot;three great pilgrimages of Christendom&quot;, along with Jerusalem and the &quot;Via Francigena&quot; to Rome.

In 1987, the Camino, which encompasses several routes in Spain, France, and Portugal, was declared the first Cultural Route of the Council of Europe. Since 2013, the Camino has attracted more than 200,000 pilgrims each year, with an annual growth rate of more than 10 percent. Pilgrims come mainly on foot and often from nearby cities, requiring several days of walking to reach Santiago. The French Way gathers two-thirds of the walkers, but other minor routes are experiencing a growth in popularity. The French Way and the Northern routes in Spain were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, followed by the routes in France in 1998, because of their historical significance for Christianity as a major pilgrimage route and their testimony to the exchange of ideas and cultures across the routes.

== Major Christian pilgrimage route ==

The Way of St. James was one of the most important Christian pilgrimages during the later Middle Ages, and a pilgrimage route on which a plenary indulgence could be earned; other major pilgrimage routes include the Via Francigena to Rome and the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Legend holds that St James&#x27;s remains were carried by boat from Jerusalem to northern Spain, where he was buried in what is now the city of Santiago de Compostela (according to Spanish legends, Saint James had spent time preaching the gospel in Spain, but returned to Judaea upon seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary on the bank of the Ebro River).

Pilgrims on the Way can take one of dozens of pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela. Traditionally, as with most pilgrimages, the Way of Saint James begins at one&#x27;s home and ends at the pilgrimage site. However, a few of the routes are considered main ones. During the Middle Ages, the route was highly travelled. However, the Black Death, the Protestant Reformation, and political unrest in 16th century Europe led to its decline. 

Whenever St James&#x27;s Day (25 July) falls on a Sunday, the cathedral declares a Holy or Jubilee Year. Depending on leap years, Holy Years occur in 5-, 6-, and 11-year intervals. The most recent were 1993, 1999, 2004, 2010 and 2021. The next will be in 2027.

== History ==
=== Pre-Christian history ===

The main pilgrimage route to Santiago follows an earlier Roman trade route, which continues to the Atlantic coast of Galicia, ending at Cape Finisterre. Although it is known today that Cape Finisterre, Spain&#x27;s westernmost point, is not the westernmost point of Europe (Cabo da Roca in Portugal is farther west), the fact that the Romans called it &quot;Finisterrae&quot; (literally the &quot;end of the world&quot; or &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot; in Latin) indicates that they viewed it as such. At night, the Milky Way overhead seems to point the way, so the route acquired the nickname &quot;Voie lactée&quot; – the Milky Way in French.

=== Scallop symbol ===

The scallop shell, often found on the shores in Galicia, has long been the symbol of the Camino de Santiago. Over the centuries the scallop shell has taken on a variety of meanings, metaphorical, practical, and mythical, even if its relevance may have actually derived from the desire of pilgrims to take home a souvenir.

One myth says that after James&#x27;s death, his body was transported by a ship piloted by an angel, back to the Iberian Peninsula to be buried in what is now Libredón. As the ship approached land, the wedding of the daughter of Queen Lupa was taking place on shore. The young groom was on horseback, and, upon seeing the ship&#x27;s approach, his horse got spooked, and horse and rider plunged into the sea. Through miraculous intervention, the horse and rider emerged from the water alive, covered in seashells.

From its connection to the Camino, the scallop shell came to represent pilgrimage, both to a specific shrine as well as to heaven, recalling Hebrews 11:13, identifying that Christians &quot;are pilgrims and strangers on the earth&quot;. The scallop shell symbol is used as a waymarker on the Camino, and is commonly seen on pilgrims themselves, who are thereby identified as pilgrims. During the medieval period, the shell was more a proof of completion than a symbol worn during the pilgrimage. The pilgrim&#x27;s staff is a walking stick used by some pilgrims on the way to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Generally, the stick has a hook so that something may be hung from it; it may have a crosspiece. The usual form of representation is with a hook, but in some the hook is absent. The pilgrim&#x27;s staff is represented under different forms and is referred to using different names, e.g. a pilgrim&#x27;s crutch, a crutch-staff. The crutch, perhaps, should be represented with the transverse piece on the top of the staff (like the letter &quot;T&quot;) instead of across it.

===Medieval route history ===

The earliest records of visits paid to the shrine at Santiago de Compostela date from the 9th century, in the time of the Kingdom of Asturias and Galicia. The pilgrimage to the shrine became the most renowned medieval pilgrimage, and it became customary for those who returned from Compostela to carry back with them a Galician scallop shell as proof of their completion of the journey. This practice gradually led to the scallop shell becoming the badge of a pilgrim.

The earliest recorded pilgrims from beyond the Pyrenees visited the shrine in the middle of the 11th century, but it seems that it was not until a century later that large numbers of pilgrims from abroad were regularly journeying there. The earliest records of pilgrims that arrived from England belong to the period between 1092 and 1105. However, by the early 12th century the pilgrimage had become a highly organized affair.

One of the great proponents of the pilgrimage in the 12th century was Pope Callixtus II, who started the Compostelan Holy Years.

The daily needs of pilgrims on their way to and from Compostela were met by a series of hospitals. Indeed, these institutions contributed to the development of the modern concept of &#x27;hospital&#x27;. Some Spanish towns still bear the name, such as Hospital de Órbigo. The hospitals were often staffed by Catholic orders and under royal protection. Donations were encouraged but many poorer pilgrims had few clothes and poor health often barely getting to the next hospital. Due to this, María Ramírez de Medrano founded one of the earliest hospitals of San Juan de Acre in Navarrete and a commandery for the protection of pilgrims on the Compostela route.

Romanesque architecture, a new genre of ecclesiastical architecture, was designed with massive archways to cope with huge crowds of the devout.

There was also the sale of the now-familiar paraphernalia of tourism, such as badges and souvenirs. Pilgrims often prayed to Saint Roch whose numerous depictions with the Cross of St James can still be seen along the Way. On the Camino, the cross is often seen with a Pilgrim&#x27;s scallop to mark the way of the pilgrimage.

The pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela was made possible by the protection and freedom provided by the Kingdom of France, from which the majority of pilgrims originated. Enterprising French (including Gascons and other peoples not under the French crown) settled in towns along the pilgrimage routes, where their names appear in the archives. The pilgrims were tended by people like Domingo de la Calzada, who was later recognized as a saint.

Pilgrims walked the Way of St. James, often for months and occasionally years at a time, to arrive at the great church in the main square of Compostela and pay homage to St James. Many arrived with very little due to illness or robbery or both. Traditionally pilgrims lay their hands on the pillar just inside the doorway of the cathedral, and so many now have done this it has visibly worn away the stone.

The popular Spanish name for the astronomical Milky Way is &quot;El Camino de Santiago&quot;. According to a common medieval legend, the Milky Way was formed from the dust raised by travelling pilgrims.

====First official guide book====

The official guide in those times was the &quot;Codex Calixtinus&quot;. Published around 1140, the 5th book of the codex is still considered the definitive source for many modern guidebooks. Four pilgrimage routes listed in the codex originate in France and converge at Puente la Reina. From there, a well-defined route crosses northern Spain, linking Burgos, Carrión de los Condes, Sahagún, León, Astorga, and Compostela.

====Legends of the discovery of the Tomb of St. James====

Another legend states that when a hermit saw a bright star shining over a hillside near San Fiz de Solovio, he informed the bishop of Iria Flavia, who found a grave at the site with three bodies inside, one of which, he asserted, was that of St James. Subsequently, the location was called &quot;the field of the star&quot; (&quot;Campus Stellae&quot;, corrupted to &quot;Compostela&quot;).

Another origin myth mentioned in &quot;Book IV&quot; of the &quot;Book of Saint James&quot; relates how the saint appeared in a dream to Charlemagne, urging him to liberate his tomb from the Moors and showing him the direction to follow by the route of the Milky Way.

=== Pilgrimage as penance ===
The Church employed (and employs) rituals (the sacrament of confession) that can lead to the imposition by a priest of penance, through which the sinner atones for his or her sins. Pilgrimages were deemed to be a suitable form of expiation for sin and long pilgrimages would be imposed as penance for very serious sins. As noted in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;:

Pilgrimages could also be imposed as judicial punishment for crime, a practice that is still occasionally used today. For example, a tradition in Flanders persists of pardoning and releasing one prisoner every year under the condition that, accompanied by a guard, the prisoner walks to Santiago wearing a heavy backpack.

=== Enlightenment era ===
During the American Revolution, John Adams (who would become the second President of the United States) was ordered by Congress to go to Paris to obtain funds for the cause. His ship started leaking and he disembarked with his two sons at Finisterre in 1779. From there, he proceeded to follow the Way of St. James in the reverse direction of the pilgrims&#x27; route, in order to get to Paris overland. He did not stop to visit Santiago, which he later regretted. In his autobiography, Adams described the customs and lodgings afforded to St James&#x27;s pilgrims in the 18th century and he recounted the legend as it was told to him:
== Modern-day pilgrimage ==
Although it is commonly believed that the pilgrimage to Santiago has continued without interruption since the Middle Ages, few modern pilgrimages antedate the 1957 publication of Irish Hispanist and traveller Walter Starkie&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Santiago&quot;. The revival of the pilgrimage was supported by the Spanish government of Francisco Franco, much inclined to promote Spain&#x27;s Catholic history. &quot;It has been only recently (1990s) that the pilgrimage to Santiago regained the popularity it had in the Middle Ages.&quot;
Since then, hundreds of thousands (over 300,000 in 2017) of Christian pilgrims and many others set out each year from their homes, or from popular starting points across Europe, to make their way to Santiago de Compostela. Most travel by foot, some by bicycle, and some even travel as their medieval counterparts did, on horseback or by donkey. In addition to those undertaking a religious pilgrimage, many are hikers who walk the route for travel or sport, along with an interest in exploring their own relationship with themselves, other people, nature, and what they perceive as being sacred. Also, many consider the experience a spiritual retreat from modern life.

=== Routes ===

Here, only a few routes are named. For a complete list of all the routes (traditional and less so), see: Camino de Santiago (route descriptions).
The Camino Francés, or French Way, is the most popular. The Via Regia is the last portion of the Camino Francés. Historically, because of the Codex Calixtinus, most pilgrims came from France: typically from Arles, Le Puy, Paris, and Vézelay; some from Saint Gilles. Cluny, site of the celebrated medieval abbey, was another important rallying point for pilgrims and, in 2002, it was integrated into the official European pilgrimage route linking Vézelay and Le Puy.

Most Spanish consider the French border in the Pyrenees the natural starting point. By far the most common, modern starting point on the Camino Francés is Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, on the French side of the Pyrenees, with Roncesvalles on the Spanish side also being popular. The distance from Roncesvalles to Santiago de Compostela through León is about .

The Camino Primitivo, or Original Way, is the oldest route to Santiago de Compostela, first taken in the 9th century, which begins in Oviedo. It is 320 km (199 miles) long. 

Camino Portugués, or Portuguese Way, is the second-most-popular route, starting at the cathedral in Lisbon (for a total of about 610 km) or at the cathedral in Porto in the north of Portugal (for a total of about 227 km), and crossing into Galicia at Valença.

The Camino del Norte, or Northern Way, is also less travelled and starts in the Basque city of Irun on the border with France, or sometimes in San Sebastián. It is a less popular route because of its changes in elevation, whereas the Camino Frances is mostly flat. The route follows the coast along the Bay of Biscay until it nears Santiago. Though it does not pass through as many historic points of interest as the Camino Frances, it has cooler summer weather. The route is believed to have been first used by pilgrims to avoid traveling through the territories occupied by the Muslims in the Middle Ages. From Irun the path is 817 km (508 miles) long. 

The Central European Camino was revived after the Fall of the Berlin Wall. Medieval routes, Camino Baltico and the Via Regia in Poland pass through present-day Poland reach as far north as the Baltic states, taking in Vilnius, and Eastwards to present-day Ukraine and take in Lviv, Sandomierz and Kraków.

=== Accommodation ===

In Spain, France, and Portugal, pilgrims&#x27; hostels with beds in dormitories provide overnight accommodation for pilgrims who hold a &quot;credencial&quot; (see below). In Spain this type of accommodation is called a &quot;refugio&quot; or &quot;albergue&quot;, both of which are similar to youth hostels or hostelries in the French system of &quot;gîtes d&#x27;étape&quot;.

Hostels may be run by a local parish, the local council, private owners, or pilgrims&#x27; associations. Occasionally, these &quot;refugios&quot; are located in monasteries, such as the one in the Monastery of San Xulián de Samos that is run by monks, and the one in Santiago de Compostela.

The final hostel on the route is the famous Hostal de los Reyes Católicos, which lies in the Plaza del Obradoiro across the Cathedral. It was originally constructed as hospice and hospital for pilgrims by Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs. Today it is a luxury 5-star Parador hotel, which still provides free services to a limited number of pilgrims daily.

=== &quot;Credencial&quot; or pilgrim&#x27;s passport ===
Most pilgrims purchase and carry a document called the &quot;credencial&quot;, which gives access to overnight accommodation along the route. Also known as the &quot;pilgrim&#x27;s passport&quot;, the &quot;credencial&quot; is stamped with the official St. James stamp of each town or &quot;refugio&quot; at which the pilgrim has stayed. It provides pilgrims with a record of where they ate or slept and serves as proof to the Pilgrim&#x27;s Office in Santiago that the journey was accomplished according to an official route and thus that the pilgrim qualifies to receive a &quot;compostela&quot; (certificate of completion of the pilgrimage).

=== &quot;Compostela&quot; ===

The &quot;compostela&quot; is a certificate of accomplishment given to pilgrims on completing the Way. To earn the &quot;compostela&quot; one needs to walk a minimum of 100 km or cycle at least 200 km. In practice, for walkers, the closest convenient point to start is Sarria, as it has good bus and rail connections to other places in Spain. Pilgrims arriving in Santiago de Compostela who have walked at least the last , or cycled to get there (as indicated on their &quot;credencial&quot;), and who state that their motivation was at least partially religious, are eligible for the &quot;compostela&quot; from the Pilgrim&#x27;s Office in Santiago.

The &quot;compostela&quot; has been indulgenced since the Early Middle Ages and remains so to this day, during Holy Years. The English translation reads:

The simpler certificate of completion in Spanish for those with non-religious motivation reads:

English translation:

The Pilgrim&#x27;s Office gives more than 100,000 compostelas each year to pilgrims from more than 100 countries. However, the requirements to earn a compostela ensure that not everyone who walks on the Camino receives one. The requirements for receiving a compostela are:
1) make the Pilgrimage for religious/spiritual reasons or at least have an attitude of search, 2) do the last 100 km on foot or horseback or the last 200 km by bicycle. 3) collect a certain number of stamps on a credencial.

=== Pilgrim&#x27;s Mass ===

A Pilgrim&#x27;s Mass is held in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela each day at 12:00 and 19:30. Pilgrims who received the &quot;compostela&quot; the day before have their countries of origin and the starting point of their pilgrimage announced at the Mass. The Botafumeiro, one of the largest censers in the world, is operated during certain Solemnities and on every Friday, except Good Friday, at 19:30. Priests administer the Sacrament of Penance, or confession, in many languages. In the Holy Year of 2010 the Pilgrim&#x27;s Mass was exceptionally held four times a day, at 10:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 19:30, catering for the greater number of pilgrims arriving in the Holy Year.
=== Pilgrimage as tourism ===
The Xunta de Galicia (Galicia&#x27;s regional government) promotes the Way as a tourist activity, particularly in Holy Compostela Years (when 25 July falls on a Sunday). Following Galicia&#x27;s investment and advertising campaign for the Holy Year of 1993, the number of pilgrims completing the route has been steadily rising. The most recent Holy Year occurred in 2021, 11 years after the last Holy Year of 2010. The next Holy Year pilgrimage will occur in 2027.

=== Statistics ===
The Pilgrims Office publishes statistics regarding pilgrims who got the certificate of accomplishment. In 2024 the most popular routes were the Frances (47%), Portugues (19%), Potuguese Costa (15%), Ingles (5.6%), Primitivo (4.9%) and Norte (4.3%). Most pilgrims had a Spanish nationality (44%), followed by US-Americans (8%), Italians (6%), Germans (4.9%) and Portuguese (4.6%). Most pilgrims started in Sarria (32%), Tui/Valença (11.3%), Porto (10.5%), Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (6.9%) and Ferrol (5.7%). 93% do the journey on foot and 4.6% by bike. The months in which most pilgrims finish their journey in Santiago de Compostela are from May to September.

=== In film, television &amp; literature ===
(Chronological)

*The pilgrimage is central to the plot of the film &quot;The Milky Way&quot; (1969), directed by surrealist Luis Buñuel. It is intended to critique the Catholic church, as the modern pilgrims encounter various manifestations of Catholic dogma and heresy.
*In Part Four of the novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; (1989), one of the main characters, Aliena, travels the Camino in search of her lost love, Jack, who is also the father to her child. She travels the route from England through France (specifically Tours and Saint Denis) and Spain, eventually reaching Santiago and continuing on to Toledo.
*&quot;The Naked Pilgrim&quot; (2003) documents the journey of art critic and journalist Brian Sewell to Santiago de Compostela for the UK&#x27;s Channel Five. Travelling by car along the French route, he visited many towns and cities on the way including Paris, Chartres, Roncesvalles, Burgos, León and Frómista. Sewell, a lapsed Catholic, was moved by the stories of other pilgrims and by the sights he saw. The series climaxed with Sewell&#x27;s emotional response to the Mass at Compostela.
*The Way of St. James was the central feature of the film &quot;Saint Jacques... La Mecque&quot; (2005) directed by Coline Serreau.
*In &quot;The Way&quot; (2010), written and directed by Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen learns that his son (Estevez) has died early along the route and takes up the pilgrimage in order to complete it on the son&#x27;s behalf. The film was presented at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2010 and premiered in Santiago in November 2010.
* On his PBS travel Europe television series, Rick Steves covers Northern Spain and the Camino de Santiago in series 6.
*In 2013, Simon Reeve presented the &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; series on BBC2, in which he followed various pilgrimage routes across Europe, including the Camino de Santiago in episode 2.
*In 2014, Lydia B Smith and Future Educational Films released &quot;Walking the Camino: Six Ways to Santiago&quot; in theatres across the U.S. and Canada. The film features the accounts and perspectives of six pilgrims as they navigate their respective journeys from France to Santiago de Compostela. In 2015, it was distributed across the World, playing theatres throughout Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. It recently aired on NPTV and continues to be featured in festivals relating to the Spirituality, Mind Body, Travel, and Adventure.
*In the 2017 movie &quot;The Trip to Spain&quot;, the Camino de Santiago is mentioned as Rob Brydon quizzes Steve Coogan about what the Camino is and proceeds to explain what it is with a brief history of it.
*In 2018, series one of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; followed this pilgrimage.

<text>The Tito–Šubašić Agreements () are the result of a series of negotiations conducted by the leader of the Yugoslav Partisans, Josip Broz Tito, and the prime minister of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, Ivan Šubašić, in the second half of 1944 and early 1945. The agreements were designed to create a coalition government in post–World War II Yugoslavia that would be composed of representatives of the National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia and the government-in-exile.

The negotiations and the resulting agreements were supported and promoted by the World War II Allies, especially the United Kingdom. The British saw the process as an opportunity to influence the formation of the post-war regime in Yugoslavia, which would otherwise be left entirely to Tito and, presumably, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, which had spearheaded the Partisan resistance to the Axis occupation of the country. Tito saw the process as an opportunity to gain international diplomatic recognition of his power.

The Vis Agreement () was the initial document in the process; it was concluded on the island of Vis in June 1944. The central agreement in the series was initialled on 1 November 1944 in Belgrade, but its implementation was delayed by the need to resolve a dispute – between Tito, Šubašić, and King Peter II – regarding appointments to a regency council. The process was concluded on 7 March 1945 with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. Tito thus became the prime minister of Yugoslavia.

==Background==

In April 1941, the Axis powers invaded and soon occupied Yugoslavia. When a Yugoslav defeat seemed imminent, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (&quot;Komunistička partija Jugoslavije&quot;, KPJ) instructed its 8,000 members to stockpile weapons in anticipation of armed resistance. By the end of 1941, armed resistance had spread to all areas of the country except Macedonia. Building on its experience with clandestine operations across the country, the KPJ proceeded to organise the Yugoslav Partisans, as resistance fighters, led by Josip Broz Tito. The KPJ assessed that the German invasion of the Soviet Union had created favourable conditions for an uprising. On 27 June 1941, in response, the KPJ politburo founded the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia, with Tito as commander-in-chief.

On 26–27 November, a pan-Yugoslav assembly – the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (&quot;Antifašističko vijeće narodnog oslobođenja Jugoslavije&quot;, AVNOJ) – was established at the instigation of Tito and the KPJ. The AVNOJ declared itself the future parliament of a new Yugoslav state, affirmed its commitment to forming a democratic federation, denied authority of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, and forbade King Peter II of Yugoslavia from returning to the country. Additionally, the National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia (&quot;Nacionalni komitet oslobođenja Jugoslavije&quot;, NKOJ) was established and confirmed by the AVNOJ as an all-Yugoslav executive body.

On 3 June, Tito was evacuated to Bari, after his headquarters in Drvar were overrun in consequence of a German airborne landing in late May 1944. Shortly afterwards, he was transported by destroyer HMS &quot;Blackmore&quot; to the island of Vis. By 9 June, British and Soviet missions had been established on the island.

==Vis Agreement==
On 12 April 1944, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill began pressuring Peter II to appoint a former governor of the Banovina of Croatia, Ivan Šubašić, to the position of prime minister of the government-in-exile. Peter II complied on 1 June, and Šubašić accepted the position, returning from the United States where he had been living since 1941. Šubašić met with Tito on the Island of Vis two weeks later. Similarly, Churchill sent a letter to Tito ahead of the meeting, stating the importance the British government placed on a future agreement between him and the government-in-exile.

The meeting produced the Vis Agreement, which declared that it was the will of the signatories to form a coalition government, but that the system of government in Yugoslavia would only be decided on once the war was over. Furthermore, Šubašić accepted the decisions made by the AVNOJ in November 1943, and he recognised the legitimacy of bodies established by the AVNOJ. The question of retaining or abolishing the Yugoslav monarchy was left for after the war. The agreement was signed on 16 June. At the time, Tito said that he was primarily concerned about the liberation of the country – and claimed that the establishment of a communist regime was not a major aim.

==Naples Conference and flight to Moscow==
Churchill deemed that Tito was not doing enough in return for British support, particularly citing British protection of the Yugoslav island of Vis. His discontent was echoed by the British Foreign Office. The situation led to a meeting between Churchill and Tito in Naples on 12 August. There, Churchill presented Tito with a British request that Tito publicly renounce any possibility of resorting to armed force to influence the adoption of a political system in post-war Yugoslavia. Churchill also wanted Tito to declare that he was not pursuing the establishment of a Communist regime after the war. Tito evaded these issues in the meeting.

A month later, on 12 September, Peter II broadcast a proclamation that called upon national unity and allegiance to Tito. On 18 September, Tito met with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow and secured the promise of Red Army help in the upcoming Belgrade Offensive, as well as its departure shortly afterwards. Most significantly, the meeting signified Soviet recognition of Tito’s authority in Yugoslavia. The British realised that Soviet forces would enter Yugoslavia, which would limit British influence. During the Fourth Moscow Conference, in an attempt at mitigation, Churchill sought to limit Soviet influence in Yugoslavia through the Percentages Agreement.

==Belgrade agreement==
Shortly afterward, Šubašić returned to Yugoslavia, arriving at Tito’s headquarters in Vršac on 23 October 1944. As the two were scheduled to resume their talks on post-war government, both were sent a joint message from the British and Soviet foreign ministers – Anthony Eden and Vyacheslav Molotov – expressing hope that the talks would result in the establishment of a coalition government. Tito and Šubašić resumed talks on 28 October. On 1 November, British and Soviet mission chiefs were asked to attend the initialling of the draft agreement as witnesses.

In the new agreement, the parties spelled out a detailed plan for a coalition government as envisaged on Vis earlier that year. The agreement initially specified that the new government would have 18 members – 12 drawn from the ranks of the NKOJ and 6 from the government-in-exile. Tito was to be the prime minister, while Šubašić would be his deputy and the foreign minister. The new government would call an election to decide the country&#x27;s system of governance. In the meantime, Yugoslavia would theoretically remain a monarchy. Peter II would be the titular head of the country, but he would remain abroad. In his stead, the agreement provided for a council of three regents to represent the king in Yugoslavia, although it was also decided that the agreement would only be signed with the king&#x27;s approval.

Since Tito’s position was backed by a substantial Partisan force in the country, and Šubašić had no such power to press for a different agenda, the regency is interpreted as a concession by Tito to the government-in-exile, designed to promote good will among the Western Allies. The agreement also determined that, once the war was over, the new government would issue a declaration supporting democratic liberties and personal freedoms, including the free practise of religion and a free press. However, Tito had started to publicly change his position by January 1945.

British diplomats pointed out that the proposed government would actually have 28 voting members (with an additional 10 drawn from the NKOJ) and that half of Šubašić&#x27;s contingent in the new government supported Tito – giving Tito a 25 to 3 edge. Furthermore, Šubašić went to Moscow on 20 November to seek Stalin&#x27;s support for the agreement before returning to London. This course of action led Peter II to consider sacking Šubašić, and only Churchill&#x27;s intervention dissuaded him.

On 7 December, Tito and Šubašić signed two additional agreements dealing with the election of a constituent assembly, the disposition of the property of Peter II, and the regency council. In a meeting held that day, the head of British mission to Yugoslavia Fitzroy Maclean told Tito that the British would only consider diplomatic recognition of his authority if he and Šubašić successfully formed a coalition government.

==Regency dispute==
In a meeting with Churchill and Eden on 21 December, and in his letters to the British Prime Minister of 29 December 1944 and 4 January 1945, Peter II rejected the proposed regency as unconstitutional. Nonetheless, Churchill pressed the king to accept all decisions of the future Yugoslav government regarding the regency. Regardless, on 11 January the king formally objected to the regency and the AVNOJ having legislative powers, and rejected the Tito–Šubašić Agreement. On 22 January, the king sacked Šubašić for concluding the agreement without consulting him on the matter.

In response, the British sought, and received, United States support for Šubašić to proceed, over the king&#x27;s objections, with implementation of the agreement with Tito, who was informed of, and accepted, such a proceeding. The British may have been motivated by fear that the USSR might unilaterally recognise the NKOJ as the Yugoslav government. In the period of 25–29 January, Peter II retracted his dismissal of Šubašić after negotiating with him and agreeing that the government-in-exile would resign and Šubašić would be re-appointed with the task of furthering the king&#x27;s views on his right to appoint the regency.

As the Šubašić-led government was scheduled to return to Belgrade on 7 February, the king proposed a regency consisting of army general and former prime minister Dušan Simović, Juraj Šutej (a Croat in Šubašić’s government), and (a Slovene member of the NKOJ). On 5 February, Tito refused to accept Šutej and proposed Ante Mandić (a Croat member of the AVNOJ) instead. The next day, Šubašić opposed Simović’s appointment, citing his decision to surrender to the Axis powers in 1941 without consulting other government ministers. Instead, he proposed to appoint Sreten Vukosavljević, who was a member of his government in the period after the Vis Agreement. The dispute led to a delay in relocating the government.

The Tito–Šubašić agreement was discussed and supported at the Yalta Conference, which issued a communique calling for implementation of the agreement, expansion of the AVNOJ to include members of old Yugoslav parliament who did not collaborate with the Axis powers, and submission of acts of the AVNOJ to ratification by an elected constituent assembly. The Yalta communique was relayed to Tito by Maclean, and Tito accepted it in full. Peter II and Šubašić accepted the communique on 12 February. The king replaced Simović&#x27;s regency nomination of Vukosavljević with that of Milan Grol, while persisting in nominating Šutej to the council. Tito rejected both appointments.

On 26 February, Tito and Šubašić concluded a further agreement specifying Srnec and Mandić as Slovene and Croat members of the regency council and providing a list of four potential Serb members of the regency for the king to choose from. The king was informed that he had until the end of the week to comply, otherwise his consent would be presumed. Peter II complied and selected Srđan Budisavljević (a former minister in the government-in-exile). The king presented his decision to the president of the AVNOJ, Ivan Ribar, in London on 3 March. The Šubašić government resigned three days later. The regency council, in its only official act, then appointed a 28-member provisional government of Yugoslavia on 7 March, in compliance with the Tito–Šubašić Agreement

==Aftermath==

In recognition of the new Yugoslav government, British, Soviet, and US ambassadors were posted to Belgrade in the second half of March. Initially, the new government opted to proclaim its anti-fascism, the &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot; of nations living in Yugoslavia, and general humanistic values. However, as the elections scheduled for autumn of 1945 were approaching, Communists were gradually appointed to key positions, and civil rights and freedoms were increasingly curtailed. Also, legislation was introduced to prosecute real and perceived enemies of the people and the state.

On one hand, the government-in-exile and Šubašić meant to limit communist control over the government of post-war Yugoslavia through the agreements with Tito, possibly with British assistance. On the other hand, Tito sought to use the agreements to boost the legitimacy of his claim to power by associating himself with the government-in-exile and the formation of a broad governing coalition. The provisional government established in March 1945 included Tito as the prime minister and Šubašić as the foreign minister, the latter as one of eleven non-communist government ministers. However, only six of the eleven were previously members of the government-in-exile. Out of that six, only three were not supporters of, or not otherwise affiliated with, the Partisans – Šubašić, Šutej, and Grol, all of whom resigned their positions within months – Grol in August and the others in October.

<doc id="736939" wikidata="Q3236289" url="?curid=736939" title="Prisoner in the Vatican">
<text>A prisoner in the Vatican (; ) or prisoner of the Vatican described the situation of the pope with respect to the Kingdom of Italy during the period from the capture of Rome by the Royal Italian Army on 20 September 1870 until the Lateran Treaty of 11 February 1929. Part of the process of the unification of Italy, the city&#x27;s capture ended the millennium-old temporal rule of the popes over Central Italy and allowed Rome to be designated the capital of the new country. Although the Italians did not occupy the territories of Vatican Hill delimited by the Leonine walls and offered the creation of a city-state in the area, the popes from Pius IX to Pius XI refused the proposal and described themselves as prisoners of the new Italian state.

== Beginnings ==
As nationalism swept Italy in the 19th century, efforts to unify the nation were blocked in part by the Papal States, which ran through the middle of the Italian peninsula and included the ancient capital Rome. The Papal States were able to fend off efforts to conquer them largely through the pope&#x27;s influence over the leaders of stronger European powers such as France and Austria. When Italian troops entered Rome, the Italian government reportedly intended to let the pope keep the part of Rome on Vatican Hill west of the Tiber, called Leonine City due to its walls built by Pope Leo IV, a small remaining Papal State, but Pius IX refused. One week after entering Rome, the Italian troops had taken the entire city save for the territories of Vatican Hill; the inhabitants of Rome then voted to join Italy (those living in the Vatican were allowed to vote outside of the Leonine walls).

For the next 59 years, the popes refused to leave the Vatican in order to avoid any appearance of accepting the authority wielded by the Italian government over Rome as a whole. During this period, popes also refused to appear at Saint Peter&#x27;s Square or at the balcony of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica facing it. Popes granted the &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot; blessings from a balcony facing a courtyard, or from inside the basilica, and papal coronations were instead held at the Sistine Chapel.

== Law of Guarantees ==

The 13 May 1871 Italian Law of Guarantees, passed eight months after the capture of Rome, was an attempt to solve the problem by making the pope a subject of the Kingdom of Italy, not an independent sovereign, while guaranteeing him certain honours similar to those given to the king and the right to send and receive ambassadors.

The popes—Pius IX (died 1878) and his successors Leo XIII (reigned 1878–1903), Pius X (1903–14), Benedict XV (1914–22), and Pius XI (from 1922 until the issue was resolved in 1929)—refused to accept this unilateral decision, which, they felt, could be reversed by the same power that granted it, and which did not ensure that their decisions would be clearly seen to be free from interference by a political power. They claimed that total sovereignty was needed so that a civil government would never attempt to interfere in the governance of the universal Roman Church. Therefore, even after the Law of Guarantees, Pope Pius IX and his successors up to and including Pius XI decided not to leave the Palace of the Vatican, so as not to submit to the authority of the Italian State. As a result of the crisis, Pope Pius IX excommunicated the Italian king Victor Emmanuel II.

Especially in the strongly Roman Catholic rural areas of Italy, there was great tension between the Church and state. The newly unified Kingdom of Italy did not recognise the validity of Church weddings, while the Church maintained that the Kingdom was illegitimate and Church weddings were sufficient before God.

==Roman question==
Following the fall of Rome, most countries continued to accredit diplomatic representatives to the Holy See, seeing it as an entity of public international law with which they desired such relations, while they withdrew their consuls, whose work had been connected instead with the temporal power of the papacy, which was now ended; however, no diplomatic relations existed between the Holy See and the Italian state.

According to Jasper Ridley, at the 1867 Congress of Peace in Geneva, Giuseppe Garibaldi referred to &quot;that pestilential institution which is called the Papacy&quot; and proposed giving &quot;the final blow to the monster&quot;. This was a reflection of the bitterness that had been generated by the struggle against Pope Pius IX in 1849 and 1860, and it was in sharp contrast to the letter that Garibaldi had written to the pope from Montevideo in 1847, before those events.

The stand-off was ended on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Pacts created a new microstate, that of Vatican City, and opened the way for diplomatic relations between Italy and the Holy See. The Holy See in turn recognised the Kingdom of Italy, with Rome as its capital, thus ending the situation whereby the popes had felt constrained to remain within the Vatican. Subsequently, the popes resumed visiting their cathedral, the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, situated on the opposite side of the city of Rome, and to travel regularly to their summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, from Rome.

<doc id="736951" wikidata="Q1454359" url="?curid=736951" title="Lindisfarne (band)">
<text>Lindisfarne are an English folk rock band from Newcastle upon Tyne established in 1968 (originally called Brethren). The original line-up comprised Alan Hull (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Ray Jackson (vocals, mandolin, harmonica), Simon Cowe (guitar, mandolin, banjo, keyboards), Rod Clements (bass guitar, violin) and Ray Laidlaw (drums). 

They are best known for the albums &quot;Nicely Out of Tune&quot; (1970), &quot;Fog on the Tyne&quot; (1971) (which became the biggest selling UK album in 1972), &quot;Dingly Dell&quot; (1972) and &quot;Back and Fourth&quot; (1978), and for the success of songs such as &quot;Meet Me on the Corner&quot;, &quot;Lady Eleanor&quot;, &quot;Run for Home&quot;, &quot;Fog on the Tyne&quot; and &quot;We Can Swing Together&quot;.

==History==
===Early days===
The group began as The Downtown Faction, led by Rod Clements, then changed their name to Brethren. In 1968, they were joined by Alan Hull and became Lindisfarne, after the small island, Lindisfarne, off the coast of Northumberland.

===Charisma records===
In 1970, Tony Stratton Smith signed them to Charisma Records and their debut album &quot;Nicely Out of Tune&quot; was released that year. This album defined their mixture of bright harmony and up tempo folk rock. Neither single released from the album, &quot;Clear White Light&quot; or &quot;Lady Eleanor&quot;, charted; nor did the album itself at first. However, the band obtained a strong following from its popular live concerts and built a reputation as one of the top festival bands.

Their second album &quot;Fog on the Tyne&quot; (1971) produced by Bob Johnston, began their commercial success. This album reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart the following year. The extracted single &quot;Meet Me on the Corner&quot;, composed by Clements and sung by Jackson, reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart and remains the only Lindisfarne song to win an Ivor Novello Award. The performance of this song on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; featured Laidlaw striking a large bass drum with a rubber fish. 

&quot;Lady Eleanor&quot; was reissued as a follow-up to &quot;Meet Me on the Corner&quot; and reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 82 in the US. The debut album &quot;Nicely Out of Tune&quot; belatedly made the UK Albums Chart Top 10 and the band began to attract a larger media following, with some calling Hull the greatest songwriter since Bob Dylan. The band were referred to as the &quot;1970s Beatles&quot;.

===&quot;Dingly Dell&quot; and change of line-up===
In 1972, they recorded their third album, &quot;Dingly Dell&quot;, but the band were unhappy with the initial production and remixed it themselves. It was released in September 1972 and entered the Top 10 in the first week, receiving lukewarm reviews. The ecologically themed single &quot;All Fall Down&quot; was a UK Singles Chart No. 34 hit and the second single &quot;Court in the Act&quot; failed completely.

Internal tensions surfaced during a disappointing tour of Australia in early 1973. Hull initially considered leaving the band, but was persuaded to reconsider. It was agreed that he and Jackson would keep the group name while Cowe, Clements and Laidlaw left to form their own outfit Jack the Lad. They were replaced by Tommy Duffy (bass guitar), Kenny Craddock (keyboards), Charlie Harcourt (guitar) and Paul Nichols (drums). The new line-up lacked the appeal of the original and with Hull also pursuing a solo career, the band&#x27;s next two albums &quot;Roll on Ruby&quot; and &quot;Happy Daze&quot; and the subsequent singles failed to chart and they disbanded in 1975. Nichols subsequently joined the hard rock supergroup Widowmaker.

===Mercury Records period===
The original line-up of Alan Hull, Ray Jackson, Ray Laidlaw, Rod Clements and Simon Cowe reformed in 1976 to perform a one-off gig but due to demand for tickets 2 other concerts were quickly added in Newcastle City Hall before they returned to their other projects. The Newcastle City Hall reunion was so acclaimed that the band repeated it a year later which also were recorded for the double live album &#x27;Magic in the Air&#x27; and decided to get back together on a permanent basis in early 1978, Jack the Lad having disbanded after none of their singles or albums on two different labels made the charts. They continued to perform at Newcastle City Hall every Christmas for many years, a total of 132 shows at the venue overall. They gained a new record deal with Mercury Records and returned to the charts in 1978 with the UK chart top 10 hit &quot;Run For Home&quot;, an autobiographical song about the rigours of touring and relief at returning home. The song also gave them a hit in various countries, and was their first top 40 US singles chart hit with Atco Records, reaching No. 33. The album &quot;Back and Fourth&quot; moved into the Top 30 of the UK Albums Chart; however, subsequent singles taken from the album which included &quot;Juke Box Gypsy&quot; and &quot;Warm Feeling&quot; failed to sustain their newly found success. The Australian tour of early 1979 was cancelled after their show in Wellington, New Zealand, when the promoter vanished with their fee and air tickets home. The next album &quot;The News&quot; (1979) and the singles from it were commercial failures, and the band lost their record deal. In 1980, they supported The Beach Boys at the Knebworth Festival.

;1980s
Over the following decade, the original quintet continued to release albums. They formed their own company &quot;Lindisfarne Musical Productions&quot; and recorded singles such as the electric, rock-oriented &quot;Friday Girl&quot; and the humorous song &quot;I Must Stop Going To Parties&quot; in the early 1980s, as well as the album &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot;. In 1984, they supported Bob Dylan and Santana at St James&#x27; Park. Saxophonist, flautist and vocalist Marty Craggs joined shortly afterwards, making the band a sextet. During the second half of the 1980s, they played annual Christmas tours and released &quot;Dance Your Life Away&quot; (1986) and &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot; (1987) – the latter made up of covers of old rock and roll standards and reworkings of some of the band&#x27;s most popular songs. Keyboardist Steve Daggett, formerly of new wave band Stiletto, produced both these albums and augmented the onstage line-up for two tours. Another album, &quot;Amigos&quot;, was released in 1989.

;1990s

In 1990, Lindisfarne introduced themselves to a younger generation with the duet &quot;Fog on the Tyne Revisited&quot;, accompanied by footballer Paul Gascoigne, which reached No. 2 in the UK singles chart. Around this time, Jackson left the band and Craggs took over his lead vocals, adding piano accordion and tin whistle, as the band gradually rediscovered its acoustic roots. Clements started to play slide guitar and mandolin, his former role as bassist being filled by Steve Cunningham and, later, Ian Thomson. Hull&#x27;s son-in-law Dave Hull-Denholm joined in 1994 to replace Cowe, who left shortly after the recording of the album &quot;Elvis Lives on the Moon&quot; and emigrated to Toronto, Canada, where he ran a brewery. He rejoined them briefly on stage for occasional dates on a subsequent American tour. He died in September 2015 from oesophageal cancer.

===Death of Hull and 2nd break-up===
Alan Hull died on 17 November 1995, but the surviving members continued to use the name. With former Jack The Lad frontman Billy Mitchell in Hull&#x27;s place, the band released two more studio albums, &quot;Here Comes The Neighbourhood&quot; (1997) and &quot;Promenade&quot; (2002). A number of live albums were also released. Craggs quit in 2000, after which Mitchell took over Jackson&#x27;s and Craggs&#x27; lead vocals and used the harmonica on a harness.

Lindisfarne finally broke up in May 2004, with the full line-up performing a final concert on 1 November 2003 at the Newcastle Opera House. The final line-up as a band consisted of Dave Hull-Denholm, Billy Mitchell, Rod Clements, Ian Thomson and Ray Laidlaw. Clements, Hull-Denholm, and Mitchell continued to tour under the name Lindisfarne Acoustic until May 2004 (the trio having played under this name occasionally since 2002), whilst Clements, Hull-Denholm and Thomson formed The Ghosts of Electricity.

===Alan Hull memorial concert and plaque===
On 19 November 2005, the friends and colleagues of Alan Hull held a memorial concert at Newcastle City Hall and included Alan Clark, Brendan Healy, Tim Healy, Ian McCallum, The Motorettes, Jimmy Nail, Tom Pickard, Prelude, Paul Smith and Kathryn Tickell. Proceeds from the concert were donated to The North East Young Musicians Fund. The Alan Hull Award for young musicians in the North East was set up a year later in response to the success of the concert.

On 19 July 2012, following a public campaign led by Lindisfarne&#x27;s former manager from the 1970s, Barry McKay, an Alan Hull memorial plaque was unveiled on the front of Newcastle City Hall, at a ceremony attended by hundreds of fans and filmed by Sky TV and Tyne Tees Television.

===The Lindisfarne Story touring band===
In mid 2012, Ray Laidlaw, Billy Mitchell and The Billy Mitchell Band toured &#x27;The Lindisfarne Story&#x27;, consisting of the band&#x27;s music and stories from Lindisfarne&#x27;s history. This was followed by a concert at Newcastle City Hall in June 2013.

In February 2013, in support of Newcastle City Hall which was then under threat of closure, Ray Jackson announced he would return to the iconic venue for a Christmas show for the first time in 23 years. Tickets for Ray Jackson&#x27;s Lindisfarne Christmas Show sold out in six hours. A second show was added for 22 December 2013, which also sold out.

===Ray Jackson&#x27;s Lindisfarne: 2013–2014===
In June 2013, Ray Jackson announced the line-up of what is Ray Jackson&#x27;s Lindisfarne, comprising himself, Daggett, Harcourt, Hull-Denholm, and Thomson, along with new recruit Paul Thompson (of Roxy Music) on drums. At the same time, a third Newcastle City Hall 2013 Christmas Show was announced, which also sold out. All of the band members hail from the Newcastle area.

===Lindisfarne: 2015–present===
On 12 January 2015, it was announced that Ray Jackson had retired from the band. The remaining members later announced that Rod Clements had rejoined the band in Jackson&#x27;s place.

On 30 July 2018, Lindisfarne announced the retirement of Charlie Harcourt from the band due to health issues; Rod Clements added that Lindisfarne would continue as a five-piece. Harcourt died on 28 July 2020.

In 2021, Paul Thompson retired from the band and was replaced by Paul Smith on drums.

<doc id="736960" wikidata="Q590776" url="?curid=736960" title="Invergordon Mutiny">
<text>The Invergordon Mutiny was a mutiny by around 1,000 sailors in the British Atlantic Fleet that took place on 15–16 September 1931. For two days the sailors on the ships of the Royal Navy at Invergordon caused a disturbance and refused to take military orders in a dispute over pay.

The mutiny caused a panic on the London Stock Exchange and a run on the pound, bringing Britain&#x27;s economic troubles to a head and forcing it off the Gold Standard on 21 September 1931.

==Causes==
In September 1931, as part of its attempts to deal with the Great Depression, the new National Government launched cuts to public spending. In the Navy this amounted to a 10% pay cut (matching 10% cuts across the board for public sector workers) for officers and senior ratings, and for junior ratings on the &quot;new rate&quot; of pay, introduced for new entrants in 1925. Ratings below petty officer who had joined before 1925 would have their pay reduced to the same level, amounting to a 25% cut. Many Labour Party supporters also shared the sense of betrayal felt in the labour movement at Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s split with the Labour Party and his formation of the new National Government with the Conservatives.

Sailors of the Atlantic Fleet, arriving at Invergordon on the Cromarty Firth in Scotland in the afternoon of Friday 11 September, learned about the cuts from newspaper reports; some reports implied that a 25% cut would be imposed on all ratings. The shock of this news had a palpable effect. On 12 September, orders were received from the Admiralty confirming the pay cuts. On the evening of 13 September, by which time sailors had already started agitating, Rear-Admiral Wilfred Tomkinson, in temporary command of the fleet while Admiral Sir Michael Hodges was in hospital, received a letter from the Admiralty dated 10 September giving the reasons for the reduction in pay and the principles on which it had been based. The following morning, Tomkinson ordered the commanders of all ships present to read sections of the letter to their officers and crew. However, several ships had not received copies of the letter and some were unable to pass the information on to their companies until the next day. By that time, the mood for a mutiny had taken hold in many crews.

==Initial disturbances==
Ten warships arrived in port on 11 September: (the flagship), , , , , , , , , and . After arriving, officers and crew had access to newspapers, which contained reports of the pay cuts. On the night of 12 September a group of sailors met at a football field. They voted to organise a strike and left singing &quot;The Red Flag&quot;. The following evening a number of them made speeches at the canteen ashore criticising the cuts. The Officer of the Patrol reported this disturbance to &quot;Warspite&quot;, the ship of the watch that night, and requested reinforcements. Extra patrols were sent, led by the commander of &quot;Warspite&quot;, Captain Wake, and the canteen was closed early. The crews left peacefully, although further speeches were made at the pier. After considering reports about the incident from Wake and the Chief of Staff, Rear-Admiral Ragnar Colvin, Tomkinson decided not to take disciplinary action. He reported the incident and his decision to the Admiralty by telegram. Meanwhile, arrived at port.
On 14 September, &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Malaya&quot; left the harbour to perform planned exercises, and during the day four more ships arrived: , , &quot;Snapdragon&quot; and &quot;Tetrarch&quot;. That evening, Tomkinson hosted a dinner attended by most of the ships&#x27; commanders and various flag officers. Shortly before dinner, Tomkinson was informed that patrols had been dispatched from &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; to deal with further disturbances at the canteen and in the open air ashore. These disturbances were characterised as disorderly, and civilians were reportedly spotted amongst the sailors. The Officer of the Patrol was able to address the assembly, but speeches, cheering and singing recommenced after he had finished. The sailors returned to their ships, but many gathered on deck after their return and continued their protests. Tomkinson informed the Admiralty of the protests, stating that the cause seemed to be the disproportionate pay cut of 25% for some ratings. He ordered commanders to return to their ships and report on the situation.

The reports indicated that there was no trouble in the cruisers, nor on the battlecruiser &quot;Repulse&quot;, but crews on the battlecruiser &quot;Hood&quot; and the battleships &quot;Rodney&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Nelson&quot; intended to prevent their ships from sailing in practice manoeuvres the next day; the protests were confined to ratings below leading rate, and did not show any animosity towards officers. In the early hours of 15 September, Tomkinson considered cancelling the exercises. However, after discussions with several flag officers, the commanders of &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Nelson&quot; and the Officers of the Patrol who had witnessed events, he decided against this, expecting that &quot;Repulse&quot; would follow orders and this would quell any resistance on other ships. He ordered commanders to investigate complaints in due course and report typical cases that he could use to represent the protests to the Admiralty, and informed the Admiralty that he expected problems sailing in the morning.

==The mutiny==
On the morning of 15 September, &quot;Repulse&quot; sailed on time at 06:30, but sailors on the other four capital ships due to sail had already begun to refuse orders. On &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Nelson&quot;, crews carried out the ordinary harbour routine, refusing to put to sea; on &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot;, crews carried out only essential duties, including the provision of safety patrols and fire guards, and did so without any recourse to their officers. Throughout the day, cheering crowds massed on the forecastles of all ships except &quot;Centurion&quot; and &quot;Exeter&quot;. On &quot;Rodney&quot;, a piano was dragged on deck and songs were sung. Officers, who issued orders and threats through loudspeakers, were ignored and ridiculed. &quot;Valiant&quot; unmoored and attempted to put to sea with a limited number of men on duty, but was unable to proceed. On Tomkinson&#x27;s own ship, &quot;Hood&quot;, crew members prevented officers and senior ratings from unmooring the ship. Even Royal Marines, expected to enforce discipline and break up any mutiny, joined the strike. Tomkinson suspended the exercises until further notice, cancelled all leave and called for the investigations of complaints to proceed as quickly as possible. &quot;Warspite&quot;, &quot;Malaya&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were ordered to return to harbour.
In the afternoon, Tomkinson again informed the Admiralty of the situation and its chief cause, asking for an early decision to be communicated and stating he did not believe it would be possible to restore order, or prevent further deterioration of the situation, until a decision was received. He finally received a reply at 20:00, instructing him to inform sailors that the existing pay rates would remain in force until the end of the month and that the Admiralty expected the men to uphold the traditions of service and carry out their duties. The Admiralty stated that the cut in pay was only 10%, but this ignored the situation for those on the old pay rate. In a second telegram, Tomkinson was instructed to resume exercises as soon as he had completed his investigations into the complaints. Tomkinson believed that this response showed he had failed to communicate the gravity of the situation and replied that it would be impossible to resume exercises in the circumstances. Incitement to stop work was spreading from deck to deck: crews on &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot; had joined those on &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; in performing only essential duties, with &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and &quot;Hood&quot; set to follow suit. There were also reports that some petty officers, who had continued to follow orders although they had not attempted to get junior ratings to return to work, were starting to join the strike.

In the early hours of 16 September, Tomkinson informed the Fleet that Admiral Colvin had been dispatched to the Admiralty to present sailors&#x27; complaints in person, but no decision could reasonably be expected for a day or two; he expected all crews to return to duty.

On the morning of 16 September, Tomkinson received the last of the complaints. He dispatched the Fleet Accountant Officer with these to the Admiralty, and sent extracts by telegram. Having discussed the situation with Rear-Admirals Astley-Rushton (Second Cruiser Squadron, on &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;) and French (Second Battle Squadron, on &quot;Warspite&quot;), he reported his belief that the mutiny would worsen unless an immediate concession was made. He suggested junior ratings on the old rate should remain on that rate with a cut of 10%, and marriage allowances should be extended to ratings under the age of 25. He also asked that members of the Admiralty board visit Invergordon to discuss matters in person. Shortly afterwards, he was informed by the Admiralty that the matter was being considered by the Cabinet, and communicated this to the Fleet. Meanwhile, the crew of &quot;Hood&quot; had ceased all but essential duties. Some sailors were threatening to damage machinery and leave ships without permission. In the afternoon, the Admiralty ordered the ships of the Fleet to return to their home ports immediately. Tomkinson directed the ships to proceed in their squadrons as soon as possible, and gave officers and crew with family at Invergordon leave to visit the shore and say their goodbyes. That night, all ships sailed from Invergordon as ordered.

==Aftermath==
In summarising the mutiny for the Admiralty, Tomkinson reported that the crews had remained respectful to their officers throughout, and that officers had done their best to explain the government&#x27;s reasons for the cut in pay and that complaints would be taken seriously. He concluded that the mutiny had been caused primarily by the 25% cut for junior ratings who had joined the service before 1925, that there were no grievances besides the pay cut, and his belief that the complaint was well founded. He also believed that any use of force would have made the situation much worse.

The Cabinet accepted Tomkinson&#x27;s recommendation that ratings on the old rate of pay remain on that rate, with a 10% cut in line with the rest of the service. It was made clear that further acts of insurrection would be severely punished. A number of the organisers of the strike were jailed, while 200 sailors were discharged from the service. A further 200-odd sailors were purged from elsewhere in the Navy, accused of attempting to incite similar incidents. The Admiralty held Tomkinson accountable for the mutiny, blaming him for failing to punish dissidents after the first protests.

The mutiny caused a panic on the London Stock Exchange and a run on the pound, bringing Britain&#x27;s economic troubles to a head and forced it off the Gold Standard on 21 September 1931.

Len Wincott, a leader of the mutiny, defected to the USSR in 1934. During World War II he survived the Siege of Leningrad but in 1946 he was sent to the Gulag after being accused of being a British spy; he was imprisoned for more than a decade. After his release in the 1950s, he became a friend of Donald MacLean in Moscow. Another leader, Navy boxer Fred Copeman, commanded the British Battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War.

<text>The Oxalidaceae, or wood sorrel family, are a small family of five genera of herbaceous plants, shrubs and small trees, with the great majority of the 570 species in the genus &quot;Oxalis&quot; (wood sorrels). Members of this family typically have divided leaves, the leaflets showing &quot;sleep movements&quot;, spreading open in light and closing in darkness.

The genus &quot;Averrhoa&quot; of which starfruit is a member, is usually included in this family (e.g. APG IV, 2016), but some botanists place it in a separate family Averrhoaceae.

<text>Antigonish ( ; ) is a town in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The town is home to St. Francis Xavier University and the oldest continuous Highland games outside Scotland. It is approximately 160 kilometres (100 miles) northeast of Halifax, the provincial capital.

==History==
Antigonish had been the location of an annual Mi&#x27;kmaq summer coastal community prior to European settlement. The original definition of the name has been lost as the Mi&#x27;kmaq language has undergone many revisions over the last two centuries. The first European settlement took place in 1784 when Lt. Colonel Timothy Hierlihy of the Royal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment received a large land grant surrounding Antigonish Harbour. Hierlihy and his party founded the Dorchester settlement, named for Sir Guy Carleton, who was Governor General of Canada and subsequently Lord Dorchester. Shortly after, Sgt Nathan Pushee of the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s Regiment settled at Chedabucto (present-day Guysborough), eventually establishing present-day Amherst, Nova Scotia. In 1796 another settler named Zephaniah Williams (of which Williams Point just outside of town was named after), with the assistance of a First Nations guide, blazed a trail from Antigonish Harbour to Brown&#x27;s Mountain, using the shortest route. This trail became a guide for travellers and eventually evolved into a winding Main Street. By the late 1820s, Dorchester was commonly referred to as Antigonish. In 1852, a newspaper, &quot;The Casket&quot;, began publication. It was recently purchased by Bounty Print in 2015.

St. Francis Xavier University was established in Antigonish in 1855, having been founded in 1853 in Arichat, Cape Breton and originally called the College of East Bay after East Bay, Nova Scotia where an earlier institution had once existed (1824–1829). St.F.X. was originally a Catholic seminary and was granted full university powers in 1866 by an act of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The town is also the episcopal seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Antigonish.

The first hospital in Antigonish opened on June 10, 1906.

Antigonish is notable for having a social movement named for it, the Antigonish Movement, launched from St. Francis Xavier University in the 1920s by local priests and educators including Moses Coady and Jimmy Tompkins.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Antigonish had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==

Antigonish is a service centre for the surrounding region that includes Antigonish and Guysborough Counties and many local businesses are based in the service sector. There are no major industrial operations located in the town or county. The workforce is primarily white collar with the largest employers being St. Martha&#x27;s Regional Hospital and St. Francis Xavier University. Until 2011, Antigonish accommodated Canada Post&#x27;s National Philatelic Centre, which provided mail-order services for worldwide collectors of Canadian stamps.

===Highway 104 Twinning===
In 2005, the provincial government approved the twinning of Highway 104 from Addington Forks Road easterly to Taylor&#x27;s Road. In 2017, the provincial government announced that a further from Sutherlands River to Antigonish would be twinned, thus creating an uninterrupted four-lane highway network from Halifax to Antigonish. The finished twinned highway was opened in July 2023.

===2004–07 retail building boom===
The Antigonish area experienced great deal of economic growth and retail development between 2004 and 2007 when the retail landscape of the town and county changed significantly. Much of the growth took place in the Post Road area, just outside town.

Other areas also saw growth. A multi-unit retail annex was constructed at the local shopping mall in the spring of 2006. This complex houses a new sporting goods store, and other businesses and services. The mall area also saw the construction of restaurants which opened in late 2006 and in February 2007.

== Education ==

St. Francis Xavier University is located in Antigonish. Established in 1853, St. Francis Xavier has 4,267 full-time students and 500 part-time students. It was named as the best primarily undergraduate university in Canada by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine for five consecutive years (2002–2006). St. Francis Xavier is also well known for the X-Ring and the Coady International Institute.

The elementary and secondary schools in Antigonish fall under the jurisdiction of the Strait Regional School Board. Antigonish is home to three public schools: Dr. John Hugh Gillis Regional High School, St. Andrew Junior School and the Antigonish Education Centre.

==Sports and culture==
The annual Antigonish Highland Games have been held since 1863. The first games were held to raise funds for the construction of St. Ninian&#x27;s Cathedral.

Year-round, the town has access to professional and community theatre through the Bauer Theatre on the StFX Campus. It is home to Festival Antigonish Summer Theatre and Theatre Antigonish.

<text>The somoni (ISO 4217 code: TJS, SM) is the currency of Tajikistan. It is subdivided into 100 dirams.

==History==
The somoni was introduced on 30 October 2000, replacing the rouble, at the rate of SM 1 = 1,000 Rbls.

One somoni is divided into 100 dirams. Diram banknotes were first introduced on 30 October 2000, and coins were later introduced in 2001 with the intention of creating a more efficient monetary system and gradually replacing the diram notes. This was also the first time circulating coins were used in Tajikistan since independence in 1991.

==Coins==
Circulation coins, first issued in 2001, were struck in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 25, and 50 dirams composed of brass-clad steel and SM 1, SM 3, and SM 5 struck in nickel-clad steel. Bimetallic SM 3 and SM 5 coins were first released in 2003. The reverses of all somoni coins are changed annually and commemorate various events. A second issue dated 2011 was issued in June 2012, and included 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 dirams and SM 1. A third series of somoni coins was issued in 2018 in denominations of SM 1, SM 3 and SM 5.

Tajikistan coins are struck by Goznak at the Saint Petersburg Mint in Russia.

===Second series (2011)===
===Third series (2018)===
A third series of somoni coins was issued in 2018 in denominations of SM 1, SM 3 and SM 5.

==Banknotes==
Banknotes of 1, 5, 20, and 50 dirams, SM 1, SM 5, SM 10, SM 20, SM 50, and SM 100 were printed in 1999 and issued in 2000. Along with a SM 3 note in 2010, inflationary pressure since the introduction of the somoni resulted in the issuing of SM 200 and SM 500 somoni notes that year. The SM 5, SM 10, SM 20, SM 50, and SM 100 somoni notes were reissued in 2013, bearing the year 1999. In 2021, the National Bank of Tajikistan issued a SM 100 banknote, similar to the original issue, but now featuring an image of the Navruz Palace on the back side of the note, replacing the image of the Presidential Palace on the previous issues of the denomination.

<text>The Swedish State Railways () or SJ, originally the Royal Railway Board (), was the former government agency responsible for operating the state-owned railways in Sweden.

== History ==
The Swedish State Railways was created on 1 June 1888 as an agency belonging to the Ministry for Civil Service Affairs, with the task of managing all state-owned railway lines in Sweden, and was transferred to the Ministry of Communications in 1920.

In 1988, the rail tracks themselves were transferred to the Swedish Rail Administration (), and in the upcoming years parts of SJ were gradually transformed into limited companies as a result of the open access obligation introduced by EU Directive 91/440. SJ was disbanded in 2001, with the assets transferred to seven separate companies, the first three owned by the Swedish government and the latter four being privatized:
*SJ AB, usually called SJ, the passenger train operator
*Green Cargo, which operates freight trains
*Jernhusen, real estate
*EuroMaint, currently a part of CAF, train maintenance
*Unigrid, information technology
*TraffiCare, which provides terminal services, e.g. train cleaning and switching
*TrainTech Engineering, currently a part of SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit, the technical unit.

Some of them have been sold to other companies, but SJ AB, Green Cargo and Jernhusen are still fully government owned (as of January 2025).
Apart from these companies, Statens Järnvägar after 2001 continued to exist as a governmental agency, mainly dealing with the leasing of rail vehicles, but otherwise had no regular railroad activities. It was dismantled at the end of 2012 when that role was fully taken over by Trafikverket.

<text>81 Terpsichore is a large and very dark main-belt asteroid. It has most probably a very primitive carbonaceous composition. It was found by the prolific comet discoverer Ernst Tempel on 30 September 1864. It is named after Terpsichore, the Muse of dance in Greek mythology.

Photometric observations of the minor planet in 2011 gave a rotation period of with an amplitude of in magnitude. This result is consistent with previous determinations. Two stellar occultation events involving this asteroid were observed from multiple sites in 2009. The resulting chords matched a smooth elliptical cross-section with dimensions of × .

== In popular culture ==

<text>Dildo Island is a small, uninhabited island in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is the largest of three islands located at the entrance to Dildo Tip in the bottom of Charlie Burgess, off the coast of the neighbouring town of Dildo.

An archaeological excavation in 1995 discovered Dorset artifacts dated to between 150 CE and 750 CE. It is believed that these people camped on Dildo Island for the purpose of seal hunting. In 2001, excavations were begun on a recently discovered Native American site that radiocarbon dated to between CE 720 and 960 CE. Evidence of a camp was found with the remnants of a wigwam and hearth. Almost all of the tools were made from purple and blue rhyolites that came from a source in Bonavista Bay roughly to the north. John Guy&#x27;s journal of 1612 suggested evidence of a Beothuk Indian camp on Dildo Island. An English fort was established in the early 18th century to defend the south side of Trinity Bay from the French during Queen Anne&#x27;s War.

A cod hatchery operated on Dildo Island from 1889 to 1897, created by Adolf Neilsen and funded by the Newfoundland government. At the time, the province of Newfoundland was one of the world leaders in hatchery technology and production. At its peak, the hatchery produced approximately 200 million cod per year.

<text>82 Alkmene is a main-belt asteroid. Alkmene was discovered by R. Luther on 7 November 1864 and named after Alcmene, the mother of Herakles in Greek mythology. Based on IRAS data, Alkmene is estimated to be about in diameter. A satellite has been suggested based on 1985 lightcurve data.

Asteroid Alkmene occulted the apparent magnitude 7.5 star HIP 99229 in the constellation of Capricornus on 18 September 2014 around 06:41 UT (17 September 23:41 PDT) and was centered on Sacramento, CA. Alkmene projected an eclipse shadow that moves at about . Asteroid occultations allow for accurate 2-dimensional mapping of an asteroids silhouette when observed by multiple telescopes separated by about 10 km (6.2 mi).

<text>Cranborne is a village in East Dorset, England. At the 2011 census, the parish had a population of 779, remaining unchanged from 2001.

Until 2019 the appropriate electoral ward was called &#x27;Crane&#x27;. This ward included Wimborne St. Giles in the west and south to Woodlands. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 2,189. After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, Cranborne is part of the Cranborne and Alderholt ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council.

Once a very small, intensely agricultural market town, the village is on chalk downland called Cranborne Chase, part of a large expanse of chalk in southern England which includes the nearby Salisbury Plain and Dorset Downs.

==History==

The village dates from Saxon times and was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot; Creneburne&quot;, meaning stream (bourne) of cranes.

In the 10th century the Benedictine abbey known as Cranborne Abbey was founded by a knight by the name of Haylward Snew (or Aethelweard Maew) who made it the parent house of the religious foundation at Tewkesbury. This arrangement lasted until 1102, when Robert Fitz Hamon greatly enlarged the church of Tewkesbury and transferred the community from Cranborne there transforming Cranborne Abbey into a priory subject to Tewkesbury Abbey. The priory was fully subject to Tewkesbury until the dissolution of the abbey in 1540. The priory buildings were demolished in 1703, but the Norman priory church of &quot;St Mary and St Bartholomew&quot; survives as the parish church.

In the 13th century, King John visited the downs for the hunt and the town hosted several subsequent kings, notably Henry VIII who founded the hunting lodge in the village. The medieval hunting lodge was modified by Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury by William Arnold between 1607 and 1611 to create Cranborne Manor House, a mixture of medieval walls and Renaissance architecture, for King James I who also came to the downs for the hunt. Since 1605, &quot;Viscount Cranborne&quot; has been the courtesy title of the heir of the Earl of Salisbury.

The village was a market town in times when it was frequented by royalty, and housed a garrison of soldiers to protect the king. The town&#x27;s population was at one time comparably large, but its importance and power have dwindled as other more accessible towns have overtaken it in size.

Cranborne was for many centuries the centre of the hundred of the same name.

==Church==

The church of St Mary and St Bartholomew is of 12th-century origin but most of the building is now of the 13th and 15th centuries. There is a massive 15th-century tower and the chancel was rebuilt in the 19th century. There are 14th-century wall paintings and a 15th-century pulpit.

==Ancient Technology Centre==

In the 1980s, a reproduction of an Iron Age dwelling, a roundhouse, was built at the back of Cranborne Middle School, as an exercise in experimental archaeology. It was later expanded into a living museum as the Cranborne Ancient Technology Centre, operated by Dorset County Council. There are several reconstructed buildings and demonstrations, and educational courses on Iron Age craftworking.

<text>83 Beatrix is a fairly large asteroid orbiting in the inner part of the main asteroid belt. It was discovered by Annibale de Gasparis on 26 April 1865. It was his last asteroid discovery. A diameter of at least was determined from the Beatrician stellar occultation observed on 15 June 1983. It is named for Beatrice Portinari, beloved of Dante Alighieri and immortalized by him in &quot;La Vita Nuova&quot; and &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;.

On 16 February 2001, an occultation of a magnitude +9.09 star by this asteroid was observed from three locations. The resulting chords matched an elliptical profile with a mean radius of 35.9 km. The observers noted some dimming and flickering at the beginning of the event, which may indicate the star was binary or the asteroid has an irregular shape. Previous occultations had been observed in 1983 and 1990, which produced a much larger size estimate of 81.4 km.

<text>Shock to the System is a 2006 gay-themed mystery film. It is the second film adaptation of a Richard Stevenson novel featuring fictional detective Donald Strachey. The film premiered at the 2006 Outfest film festival before going into rotation on the here! television network.

==Plot==

Late one night, Donald Strachey is meeting a new client in a dark alley—one Paul Hale. Hale is very nervous, and before Strachey can calm what seems like paranoia, an incoming van approaches. Hale hands the private eye a $5,000 check for a retainer just before the speeding van separates the two. The next night, however, Paul Hale turns up dead. Both the coroner and Detective Bailey rule his death a suicide due to apparent evidence of alcohol and drugs nearby his body and in his bloodstream, but neither Donald nor Paul&#x27;s mother are convinced of this. Phyllis Hale believes Paul was murdered. Strachey is determined to find out the truth about Paul&#x27;s death. On the way to work the next morning, Strachey accosts someone who he believes is breaking into his office, but it turns out to be Kenny Kwon, who was fired during a confrontation between Strachey and his boss Nathan Zenck during a prior case. Kenny convinces Donald to hire him as Strachey Investigations&#x27; new office manager.

Strachey&#x27;s lover Timmy Callahan is able to provide the firm a lead on Paul Hale—before he died, he was the spokesman for the Phoenix Foundation, which practices ex-gay conversion therapy. Strachey goes undercover into the Foundation as &quot;Kyle&quot;. In his undercover persona, the detective introduces himself to Dr. Trevor Cornell, the Foundation&#x27;s director. &quot;Kyle&quot; tells Cornell a story about a former soldier who was discharged for being gay—a story Strachey draws upon from his own past in his bid to be believable as an aspiring ex-gay.

Cornell isn&#x27;t the only one who believes that being gay is a choice determined only by how much willpower a person exerts to &quot;change&quot;. Phyllis, in her quest to blame homosexuals for Paul&#x27;s death, deflects responsibility towards an openly gay friend of his from college, Larry Phelps, whom she suggests might have killed him for his attempts to become straight. Donald attempts to talk to Larry, but he assumes Strachey is dangerous. The P.I. gives chase, but Phelps manages to elude him. Then called to the police station, he is given a copy of the autopsy report by Bailey. It turns out the drugs found in Paul Hale&#x27;s system were phenelzine, even though the bottles of pills found around his body contained Xanax. Hale didn&#x27;t have a prescription for either drug, but Bailey won&#x27;t investigate where Paul got the drugs, as he refuses to believe it was anything other than suicide.

Later, &quot;Kyle&quot; goes to a conversion therapy group, meeting the other participants in the ex-gay program. Among them are Grey, an attractive athletic type that is in a heterosexual marriage with a child, and Katie, who says she&#x27;s working on being less tomboyish and was even engaged to Paul Hale. The longer &quot;Kyle&quot; spends time with Trevor and the recipients of his therapy, the more details he gets about the estrangement between them and Paul that occurred shortly before his death, but the undercover assignment takes its toll on Strachey&#x27;s confidence in his openly gay identity, particularly during &quot;Kyle&quot;&#x27;s individual sessions with Cornell. Finally, in one session Strachey explodes into a confrontational tone, blowing his cover. Before Donald cuts ties with the ex-gays for good, Grey gives him two things—a DVD that will shed light on Paul&#x27;s murder and an offer of extramarital sex. Strachey accepts the former, but declines the latter with great difficulty and mixed emotions.

At the office, Donald watches the DVD, which features a recording of Paul describing in vague terms what his experiences with the Phoenix Foundation did to change him—but not in the way he expected. Strachey is able to determine that Larry Phelps was the one who recorded Paul&#x27;s appearance on the DVD, and knows whatever Paul did. Strachey tracks Larry down and convinces him that he means him no harm, and is not associated with the Phoenix Foundation. Larry informs Strachey that he and Paul secretly taped many of Cornell&#x27;s individual sessions with his patients, but before he is able to tell Strachey everything he knows, an unknown assailant murders Phelps.

At home, Donald&#x27;s conversations with Timmy become strained. Even broken away from Cornell&#x27;s harmful messages, his influences as &quot;Kyle&quot; still weigh heavy in his heart, making him doubtful of what kind of future and possibilities an openly gay person can have in mainstream society, even implying to Timmy that he feels &quot;trapped&quot; in their relationship. Finally, one evening, Donald breaks down and tells Timmy about his past in the army and how he and his fellow soldier and lover of 4 months—Kyle Griffin—were discovered during a moment of intimacy. In the course of the investigation, Strachey caved to the pressure his military superiors were putting on him and told them the truth, something that devastated Kyle and their relationship. Donald confesses that the day they were both discharged, Kyle committed suicide.

The next morning, Cornell is taken into custody and charged with Larry Phelps&#x27; murder—because of evidence so convenient for an arrest warrant and open and shut prosecution, that Tim and Don are convinced that Cornell is being framed. With Trevor&#x27;s reluctant blessing, Strachey convinces his wife Lynn to let him help her clear her husband of the serious charges he&#x27;s facing. Strachey discovers a hidden camera in Cornell&#x27;s office that transmitted movie files to a nearby computer in another room, which they uncover and then find out the truth. Katie is not a lesbian and has been sexually involved with Cornell, especially during their individual sessions, and it was she that put a lethal mix of phenelzine in Paul Hale&#x27;s bourbon the night of his death, murdering both him and Larry Phelps. Katie turns up at the Foundation, holding both Strachey and Lynn Cornell at gunpoint, but he manages to disarm her. Cornell is freed, at the expense of his relationship with not only the now clearly insane Katie, but also his wife, and his program as well. Having nothing else to lose, Cornell tells Strachey why he was hired by Paul. He was hoping that the P.I. could track down Paul&#x27;s father, who like his son, was gay, having been discovered by Paul&#x27;s mother with another man, and facing Phyllis&#x27; intense disapproval. Strachey makes Phyllis realize how much damage her homophobia has caused her entire family, and he can now declare this case closed.

<doc id="737028" wikidata="Q157362" url="?curid=737028" title="84 Klio">
<text>84 Klio is a fairly large and very dark main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by R. Luther on 25 August 1865, and named after Clio, the Muse of history in Greek mythology. The name Clio had previously been suggested by the discoverer of 12 Victoria, and that is the name B. A. Gould, editor of the prestigious Astronomical Journal, adopted for that asteroid, because of the controversy over the name Victoria.
An occultation by Klio over a dim star was observed on 2 April 1997.

Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2007 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico were used to create a light curve plot. This showed a synodic rotation period of 23.562 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.21 ± 0.02 magnitude during each cycle.

==Perturbation==
Perturbations of asteroid 52 Europa by 84 Klio suggest that 52 Europa would have a mass as high as 1.68 kg. But this would require Europa to have an unrealistic density of 10.6 g/cm3. Further observations of Klio will be needed to properly refine the mass of both asteroid Europa and Klio.

<doc id="737029" wikidata="Q180382" url="?curid=737029" title="Cloudburst">
<text>A cloudburst is an enormous amount of precipitation in a short period of time, sometimes accompanied by hail and thunder, which is capable of creating flood conditions. Cloudbursts can quickly dump large amounts of water, e.g. 25 mm of the precipitation corresponds to 25,000 metric tons per square kilometre (1 inch corresponds to 72,300 short tons over one square mile). However, cloudbursts are infrequent as they occur only via orographic lift or occasionally when a warm air parcel mixes with cooler air, resulting in sudden condensation. At times, a large amount of runoff from higher elevations is mistakenly conflated with a cloudburst. The term &quot;cloudburst&quot; arose from the notion that clouds were akin to water balloons and could burst, resulting in rapid precipitation. Though this idea has since been disproven, the term remains in use.

==Properties==

Rainfall rate equal to or greater than per hour is a cloudburst. However, different definitions are used, e.g. the Swedish weather service SMHI defines the corresponding Swedish term &quot;skyfall&quot; as per minute for short bursts and per hour for longer rainfalls. The associated convective cloud can extend up to a height of above the ground.

During a cloudburst, more than of rain may fall in a few minutes. The results of cloudbursts can be disastrous. Cloudbursts are also responsible for flash flood creation.

Rapid precipitation from cumulonimbus clouds is possible due to the Langmuir precipitation process in which large droplets can grow rapidly by coagulating with smaller droplets which fall down slowly. It is not essential that cloudbursts occur only when a cloud clashes with a solid body like a mountain, they can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensation.

==Detection and forecasting==

While satellites are extensively useful in detecting large-scale weather systems and rainfall, the resolution of the precipitation from these satellites are usually worse than the area of cloudbursts, and hence they go undetected. Weather forecast models also face a similar challenge in simulating the clouds at a high resolution. The skillful forecasting of rainfall in hilly regions remains challenging due to the uncertainties in the interaction between the moisture convergence and the hilly terrain, the cloud microphysics, and the heating-cooling mechanisms at different atmospheric levels.

==Record cloudbursts==

==Locations==
===Asia===
In the Indian subcontinent, a cloudburst usually occurs when a monsoon cloud drifts northwards, from the Bay of Bengal or Arabian Sea across the plains, then onto the Himalayas and bursts, bringing rainfall as high as 75 millimetres per hour.

==== Bangladesh ====
* In September 2004, mm of rain was recorded in Dhaka in 24 hours.
* On June 11, 2007 mm of rain fell in 24 hours in Chittagong.
* On July 29, 2009, a record breaking of rain was recorded in Dhaka, in 24 hours, previously of rain was recorded on July 13, 1956.

==== India ====
* On September 28, 1908 – A cloudburst resulted in a flood where level of the Musi River increased up to 3.4 meters . About 15,000 people died and around 80,000 houses were destroyed along the banks of the river.
* In July 1970, the Alaknanda valley witnessed a major flood, This was attributed to a cloudburst on the night of 20 July 1970 on the southern mountain front in the Alaknanda valley (between Joshimath and Chamoli). According to an estimate, floods transported about 15.9 × 106 tonnes of sediment within a day. The catastrophe was so large that it wiped out the leftover of the 1894 Gohna lake. In addition, a roadside settlement between Pipalkoti and Helong called Belakuchi in the Alaknanda valley was washed away along with a convoy of 30 buses, by the roaring Alaknanda river. However, around 400 pilgrims route to Badrinath, were saved due to the alertness of a police constable who guided them to run uphill. Alaknanda River in Uttarakhand and its entire river basin, from Hanumanchatti near the pilgrimage town of Badrinath to Haridwar was affected.
*On August 15, 1997, 115 people were killed when a cloudburst occurred and trail of death was all that was left behind in Chirgaon in Shimla district, Himachal Pradesh.
*On August 17, 1998, a massive landslide following heavy rain and a cloudburst at Malpa village killed 250 people, including 60 Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims in Kali valley of the Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand. Among the dead was Odissi dancer Protima Bedi.

*On 26 July 2005, a cloudburst caused approximately of rainfall in Mumbai. over a span of eight to ten hours; the deluge completely paralysed India&#x27;s largest city and financial centre, leaving over 1,000 dead. Half of the flooding was caused due to the blockage sewers in many parts of Mumbai.
* On August 14, 2007, 52 people were confirmed dead when a severe cloudburst occurred in Bhavi village in Ganvi, Himachal Pradesh.
* On August 7, 2009, 38 people were killed in a landslide resulting from a cloudburst in Nachni area near Munsiyari in Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand.

* On September 15, 2010, a cloudburst in Almora in Uttarakhand submerged two villages, one of them being Balta, in which save for a few people, the entire village drowned. Almora was declared as a town suffering from the brunt of cloudburst by the Uttarakhand authorities.
* On September 29, 2010, a cloudburst in NDA (National Defence Academy), Khadakwasla, Pune, in Maharashtra left many injured and hundreds of vehicles and buildings damaged due to the consequent flash flood.
* Again on October 4, 2010, a cloudburst in Pashan, Pune, in Maharashtra left 4 dead, many injured and hundreds of vehicles and buildings damaged; the record books registered the highest rainfall in intensity and quantity in Pune city, then about 118 years old (record of 149.1 mm in 24 hours) of October 24, 1892. In the history of IT hub Pune, for the first time this flash flood forced locals to remain in their vehicles, offices and what ever available shelter in the accompanying traffic jam.
* On October 4, 2010, a cloudburst in Pashan, Pune may have been the world&#x27;s first predicted cloudburst. Since 2:30 pm weather scientist Kirankumar Johare in the city frantically sent out SMSs to the higher authorities warning of an impending cloudburst over the Pashan area. Even after taking the necessary precautions, 4 people died including one young scientist.
* On June 9, 2011, near Jammu, a cloudburst left four people dead and over several injured in Doda-Batote highway, 135 km from Jammu. Two restaurants and many shops were washed away

Debris is still being cleared and thousands are still missing as of June 30, 2013. It left approximately 84,000 people stranded for several days. The Indian Army and its Central Command launched one of the largest and most extensive human rescue missions in its history. Spread over 40,000 square kilometres, 45 helicopters were deployed to rescue the stranded. According to a news report this incident was falsely linked with cloud burst, rather it was caused due to disturbance in the two glaciers near Kedarnath.
*On July 30, 2014, a landslide occurred in the small Indian village of Malin, located in Ambegaon taluka in Pune district of India. The landslide, which hit the village early in the morning while its residents were asleep, killed at least 20 people.

<text>Thomas Bayard McCabe (July 11, 1893 – May 27, 1982) was an American businessman who served as the 8th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1948 to 1951. McCabe also served as president and CEO of Scott Paper Company for 39 years.

==Background==
The youngest of five children, Thomas Bayard McCabe was born on July 11, 1893, to William Robbins McCabe and Beulah Whaley in Whaleyville, Maryland. According to family records, his paternal ancestors were early pioneers of Selbyville, Delaware, dating as far back as the late 1700s. By 1837, Thomas&#x27;s great-great-great grandfather, Arthur McCabe, owned what was then all of Selbyville. His grandfather, William S. McCabe was involved in the local mercantile business for over 50 years.

When McCabe&#x27;s father came of age, the firm William S. McCabe &amp; Son was formed and became one of the leading business firms in Sussex County, Delaware. His father later founded and served as the first president of the Selbyville Bank as well as a banking and insurance commissioner for the State of Delaware in the early 20th century. He was an early advocate of the Federal Reserve System. Family records state that several generations of McCabe&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maternal and paternal ancestors were early settlers of Maryland and Delaware, on the Delmarva Peninsula. He was awarded the Vermilye Medal in 1963, which is given to individuals who have leadership in business and industry in the industries of science and technology.

==Education==
McCabe attended preparatory school at Wilmington Conference Academy (now called Wesley College) in Dover, Delaware, from 1907 to 1910. Following graduation from WCA, he entered Swarthmore College, where he studied economics, graduating in 1915 with an associate bachelor&#x27;s degree. While attending Swarthmore, he joined the fraternity Delta Upsilon, as well as the Book &amp; Key secret society. In addition, he held honorary doctoral degrees from 15 colleges and universities

==Scott Paper Company==
In 1916 McCabe joined Scott Paper as a $15-a-week salesman when he was 23 years old. Scott Paper was then a small one-mill paper company. In 1917, McCabe left Scott temporarily to serve in World War I. He enlisted as a private and advanced to captain by 1919. McCabe returned to civilian life and to the Scott Paper Company at the age of 26. He advanced rapidly, moving up from assistant sales manager to become the president and CEO by age 34. By the late 1940s, McCabe was described as having shown &quot;an advanced and enlightened policy that made the company a recognized standard for modern manufacturing and sales operations&quot;. He introduced music into the mill during working hours, stock purchase plans; insurance, hospitalization, recreation, and retirement plans, at a time when benefits such as those were relatively new for American workers. McCabe transformed Scott Paper from a 500-person paper mill company in Chester, Pennsylvania, into a multinational concern with over 60 manufacturing plants throughout the world employing over 40,000 people. By the time he retired from the company&#x27;s board in 1980, Scott Paper had become a $2 billion operation.

==Federal Reserve and government service==
In 1937, McCabe joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia as a class C director, followed by his appointment as chairman of that Reserve Bank’s board of directors in 1939. During his tenure the institution took an increasingly active role in local affairs as part of the national system. McCabe leaned toward decentralization and away from the highly centralized philosophy that marked the federal government during the previous 15 years. His philosophy was in a strong local government. He felt that without healthy local business units there could be no overall national strength. McCabe called for cooperation between management, labor, and government as it means to combat inflation. He urged a cut in the federal debt as a step that should precede tax reduction, and he leaned toward a policy of credit contraction and saving as primary means of curtailing the inflation spiral. He was intensely interested in extending aid to foreign nations, being administered by one man who would report directly to the President. McCabe thought that the unification of American, British and French commands in Europe were necessary to rehabilitate Europe after World War II.

During World War II, McCabe took leave from Scott and worked for the Franklin D.Roosevelt administration. In 194142 he served as deputy administrator of the Lend-Lease program. During 194445 he served as deputy director of the division of priorities of the Office of Production Management also known as the War Production Board (WPB). He became commissioner of Army-Navy liquidation in 1945; and served as a member of the Department of Commerce’s Business Advisory Council. In 1946, he was awarded the Medal for Merit, the highest civilian honor at the time.

In 1948, two years after McCabe had returned to Scott, President Harry Truman appointed him to be the 8th Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He served from April 15, 1948March 31, 1951. McCabe took another leave of absence from Scott to serve in this position. As Fed chairman, McCabe supported a strong and independent Federal Reserve System.

When a dispute arose between the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury over interest rate policy and credit restraint in 194950, McCabe participated in the committee Truman created to hammer out a compromise. The agreement, known as the Treasury-Fed Accord, also known as the 1951 Accord was reached on March 3, 1951. His leadership was instrumental in establishing a firm opposition to the restrictive rate pegging policies that were being imposed on the Fed by the Treasury. The accord laid the foundations for the monetary policy the Fed pursues today. After resigning from the Board, McCabe returned to the private sector.

==Committee for Economic Development==
In 1942 Thomas McCabe was a founding trustee of the Committee for Economic Development. A nonprofit, nonpartisan, business-led public policy organization still in existence today.

==Eisenhower Fellowships==
In 1953, to celebrate President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s 63rd birthday, his first since being elected to the presidency, a group of businessmen led by McCabe, founded an international leader exchange program to honor his devotion to world peace. They created a private, non-profit, non-partisan organization, governed by a board of trustees whose members included presidents of IBM, B.F. Goodrich, Chairman of G.E., a governor, U.S. Cabinet Secretary, U.S. delegate to the U.N. and 7 university or college presidents. Years later, Eisenhower described the program as &quot;possibly the most splendid birthday present I have ever received.&quot;

==Scholarships, fellowships, and endowments==
The McCabe Scholarships at Swarthmore College were established in 1952 by McCabe. The National McCabe Scholarship places emphasis on ability, character, personality, leadership, and service to school and community. The Regional McCabe Scholarship is merit-based scholarship. Every year, two Regional McCabe Scholars are selected each from the Delmarva Peninsula Chester County, Montgomery County, or Delaware County in Pennsylvania. The McCabe Engineering Award is presented each year to the outstanding engineering student in the senior class. A committee of the Engineering Department faculty chooses the recipient.

The Thomas B. McCabe Jr. and Yvonne Motley McCabe Memorial Fellowship is awarded annually to graduates of Swarthmore College, and provides a grant toward an initial year of study at Harvard Business School, University of Chicago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, University of Pennsylvania, or Stanford University. Special consideration is given to Fellowship applicants who demonstrate superior qualities of leadership.

The Thomas B. McCabe Lecture Series at Swarthmore College is an annual event that brings individuals with distinguished careers in varied fields to speak on campus.

The McCabe Library houses media items supporting the Humanities and Social Sciences, and facilitates access to a collection of over 500,000 ebooks, thousands of online journals, and a growing numbers of digital films. The Friends Historical Library and the Peace Collection, an acclaimed collection of rare materials and artist&#x27;s books, can also be found there.

The McCabe Awards at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania were established in 1969 through a gift from Thomas B. McCabe and Jeannette E. Laws McCabe, to support junior faculty who initiate fresh and innovative biomedical and surgical research projects.

==Personal life==
McCabe and Jeannette Everett Laws were married on March 1, 1924. Family records show that they had three sons: Thomas B. McCabe Jr (1926-1977), Richard Whaley McCabe (1932-2006), and James Laws McCabe (1943-).
McCabe also served as President of The Union League of Philadelphia in 1962.

<text>Aelred of Rievaulx, O Cist. (), also known as also Ailred, Ælred, or Æthelred; (1110 – 12 January 1167) was an English Cistercian monk and writer who served as Abbot of Rievaulx from 1147 until his death. He is venerated by the Catholic Church as a saint and by some Anglicans.

==Life==

Aelred was born in Hexham, Northumbria, in year 1110, one of three sons of Eilaf, priest of St Andrew&#x27;s at Hexham, himself a son of another Eilaf, treasurer of Durham. In 1095, the Council of Claremont had forbidden the ordination of the sons of priests. This was done in part to end the inheritance of benefices. He may have been partially educated by Lawrence of Durham, who sent him a hagiography of Saint Brigid.

Aelred&#x27;s early education was probably at the cathedral school at Durham. Aelred spent several years at the court of King David I of Scotland in Roxburgh, possibly from the age of 14, rising to the rank of &quot;echonomus&quot; (often translated &quot;steward&quot; or &quot;Master of the Household&quot;). At some point during this period, Aelred became the target of personal harassment by a knight of the king&#x27;s court, which came to a head in the king&#x27;s presence and included a degrading sexual slur. Walter Daniel related this incident to demonstrate Aelred&#x27;s forgiveness of the knight and his skill in conflict resolution, but around this time Aelred developed feelings of depression and alienation, and he left court at age twenty-four (in 1134) to enter the Cistercian abbey of Rievaulx in Yorkshire.

In 1138, when Rievaulx&#x27;s patron, Walter Espec, was to surrender his Wark on Tweed Castle to King David of Scotland, Aelred reportedly accompanied Abbot William of Rievaulx to the Scottish border to negotiate the transfer. He saw that his reluctance to part from his friends at court delayed his adopting his monastic calling. For Aelred, the source and object of true friendship is Christ.

In 1142 Aelred travelled to Rome, alongside Walter of London, Archdeacon of York, to represent before Pope Innocent II the northern prelates who opposed the election of Henry de Sully, nephew of King Stephen as archbishop of York. The result of the journey was that Aelred brought back a letter from Pope Innocent summoning the superiors whom Aelred represented to appear in Rome the following March to make their deposition in the required canonical form. The resulting negotiations dragged on for many years.

Upon his return from Rome, Aelred became novice master at Rievaulx. In 1143, he was appointed abbot of the new Revesby Abbey, a daughter house of Rievaulx in Lincolnshire. In 1147, he was elected abbot of Rievaulx itself, a position he was to hold until his death. Under his administration, the abbey is said to have grown to some 140 monks and 500 &quot;conversi&quot; and laymen.

His role as abbot required him to travel. Cistercian abbots were expected to make annual visitations to daughter-houses, and Rievaulx had five in England and Scotland by the time Aelred held office. Moreover, Aelred had to make the long sea journey to the annual general chapter of the Order at Cîteaux in France.

Alongside his role as a monk and later abbot, Aelred was involved throughout his life in political affairs. The fourteenth-century version of the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot; states that Aelred&#x27;s efforts during the twelfth-century papal schism brought about Henry II&#x27;s decisive support for the Cistercian candidate, resulting in 1161 in the formal recognition of Pope Alexander III.

Aelred wrote several influential books on spirituality, among them &quot;Speculum caritatis&quot; (&quot;The Mirror of Charity,&quot; reportedly written at the request of Bernard of Clairvaux) and &quot;De spirituali amicitiâ&quot; (&quot;On Spiritual Friendship&quot;).

He also wrote seven works of history, addressing three of them to Henry II of England, advising him how to be a good king and declaring him to be the true descendant of Anglo-Saxon kings.

In his later years, he is thought to have suffered from the kidney stones and arthritis. Walter reports that in 1157 the Cistercian General Council allowed him to sleep and eat in Rievaulx&#x27;s infirmary; later he lived in a nearby building constructed for him.

Aelred died in the winter of 1166–7, probably on 12 January 1167 at Rievaulx.

==&quot;De spirituali amicitiâ&quot;==
&quot;De spirituali amicitiâ&quot; (&quot;On spiritual friendship&quot;), considered to be his greatest work, is a Christian counterpart of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De amicitia&quot; and designates Christ as the source and ultimate impetus of spiritual friendship. On top of its intellectual foundation, Aelred draws on his personal experience to provide &quot;specific and concrete&quot; recommendations for creating and maintaining long-term friendships. According to Brian McGuire, &quot;Aelred believed that true love has a respectable name and a rightful place in good human company, especially that of the monastery.&quot; This &quot;emphasis on the centrality of friendship in the monastic life places him outside the mainstream of the tradition. In writing a special treatise dedicated to friendship and indicating that he could not live without friends, Aelred outdid all his monastic predecessors and had no immediate successors. Whether or not his need for friendship is an expression of Aelred&#x27;s sexual identity, his insistence on individual friendships in the monastic life meant a departure from what is implied in the Rule of St. Benedict.&quot; Within the wider context of Christian monastic friendship, &quot;it was Aelred who specifically posited friendship and human love as the basis of monastic life as well as a means of approaching divine love, who developed and promulgated a systematic approach to the more difficult problems of intense friendships between monks.&quot;

It was likely at Durham that Aelred first encountered Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Laelius de Amicitia&quot;. In Roman terminology &quot;amicitia&quot; means &quot;friendship&quot; and could be between states or individuals. It suggested an equality of status and in practice it might only be an alliance to pursue mutual interests. For Cicero, &quot;amicitia&quot; involved genuine trust and affection. &quot;But I must at the very beginning lay down this principle —friendship can only exist between good men. We mean then by the &#x27;good&#x27; those whose actions and lives leave no question as to their honour, purity, equity, and liberality; who are free from greed, lust, and violence; and who have the courage of their convictions.&quot;

In &quot;Confessions&quot;, Augustine of Hippo identifies three phases of friendship: adolescence, early adulthood and adulthood. Adolescent friendships are essentially self-interested comradeship. Augustine then describes a close friendship he had as a young adult with a colleague. This was based on love and grew out of shared interests and experiences and what each learned from the other. The third mature phase for Augustine is transcendent, in that he loves others &quot;in Christ&quot;: the focus is on Christ and the point of friendship is to grow closer to Christ with and through friends. In writing of adolescent friendship Augustine said, &quot;For I even burnt in my youth heretofore, to be satiated in things below; and I dared to grow wild again, with these various and shadowy loves: my beauty consumed away, …pleasing myself, and desirous to please in the eyes of men. And what was it that I delighted in, but to love, and be loved?&quot;

Aelred was greatly influenced by Cicero, but later modified his interpretation upon reading Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;. In &quot;De spirituali amicitiâ&quot;, Aelred adopted Cicero&#x27;s dialogue format. In the Prologue however, he mirrors Augustine&#x27;s description of his early adolescence with the speaker describing his time at school, where &quot;the charm of my companions gave me the greatest pleasure. Among the usual faults that often endanger youth, my mind surrendered wholly to affection and became devoted to love. Nothing seemed sweeter to me, nothing more pleasant, nothing more valuable than to be loved and to love.&quot;

==Posthumous reputation==
Jocelyn of Furness, writing about Aelred after his death, described him as &quot;a man of the highest integrity, of great practical wisdom, witty and eloquent, a pleasant companion, generous and discreet. And with all these qualities, he exceeded all his fellow prelates of the Church in his patience and tenderness. He was full of sympathy for the infirmities, both physical and moral, of others.&quot;

Aelred was never formally canonised in the manner that was later established, but he became the centre of a cult in the north of England that was officially recognised by Cistercians in 1476. As such, he was venerated as a saint, with his body kept at Rievaulx. In the sixteenth century, before the dissolution of the monastery, John Leland, claims he saw Aelred&#x27;s shrine at Rievaulx containing Aelred&#x27;s body glittering with gold and silver. Today, Aelred of Rievaulx is commemorated as a saint on 12 January, the traditional date of his death, in the latest official edition of the Roman Martyrology, which expresses the official position of the Catholic Church.

He also appears in the calendars of various other Christian denominations.

Much of Aelred&#x27;s history is known because of the &quot;Life&quot; written about him by Walter Daniel shortly after his death.

For many centuries his most famous work has been his &quot;Life of Saint Edward, King and Confessor.&quot;

Aelred is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival and on the Episcopal Church calendar with a feast on 1&quot;2&quot; January.

==Discourses on sexuality==

Aelred has been popular with small circles of gay Catholics since at least the 1970s, and during the same time period, Brian Patrick McGuire and his students discussed the possibility that Aelred might have possessed a homosexual orientation. Within this context, &quot;there is a movement among priests and religious who consider themselves to be gay in their sexual orientation to find in historical figures such as Aelred earlier expressions of their own identity.&quot;

In 1980, the historian John Boswell characterized Aelred as a gay man in &quot;Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality,&quot; the landmark study into the relationship between the medieval Church and homosexuality. This opened up discussion of Aelred&#x27;s sexuality to a wider audience, and triggered a debate that &quot;has dragged on, often with vituperation.&quot; Critics of this hypothesis have generally used traditional literary-critical methods to argue that Aelred&#x27;s writing contains conventional monastic language rather than homoerotic language, and include Elizabeth Freeman, Jean Leclercq, and Julia Kristeva.

Ruth Mazo Karras, as the expert in medieval gender and sexuality, cites Aelred as an example of a man &quot;for whom same-sex erotic relationships, even if chaste, were important.&quot; She also states that &quot;depictions of a Middle Ages concerned only with spiritual issues as opposed to material, a culture whose people were so radically different from us that their bodies became irrelevant, have been superseded by recent scholarship.&quot; Brian McGuire, likewise, accepts Aelred as &quot;a man who felt physically and mentally more drawn to other men than to women.&quot;
Marsha L. Dutton states that &quot;...there is no way of knowing the details of Aelred&#x27;s life, much less his sexual experience or struggles.&quot; Nevertheless, Brian McGuire admits in his emotional biography of Aelred that &quot;the absence of women, Aelred&#x27;s confession of his own passion, and the knight&#x27;s obscenities all indicate that Aelred at the court of King David lost his head, his heart, and perhaps his body to another young man.&quot;

In modern times, several gay-friendly organizations have adopted Aelred as their patron saint, including Integrity USA in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, and the Order of St. Aelred in the Philippines. Aelred&#x27;s inclusion on the calendar of the Episcopal Church was initiated by Integrity USA in 1985, and he was approved by the House of Bishops with their full awareness that he was believed to be a gay man by Integrity. Two years later, Integrity canonized Aelred as their official patron, promising &quot;to regularly observe his feast, promote his veneration and seek before the heavenly throne of grace the support of his prayers on behalf of justice and acceptance for lesbians and gay men.&quot;
=== Criticism ===
Elizabeth Freeman has argued that discussion of his alleged homosexuality has abounded atop misunderstandings of monastic language and mistaking his interest in Christian friendship for homosexuality. Aelred confessed in &quot;De institutione inclusarum&quot; that for a while he surrendered himself to lust, &quot;&quot;a cloud of desire arose from the lower drives of the flesh and the gushing spring of adolescence&quot; and &quot;the sweetness of love and impurity of lust combined to take advantage of the inexperience of my youth&quot;.&quot; LeClercq characterizes this a &#x27;literary exaggeration&#x27; common to monastic writing. Aelred also refers directly to the relationship of Jesus and John the Apostle as a &quot;marriage&quot;, which is aligned with Cistercian emphasis upon the Song of Songs, and the symbolism of love between man and God, expressed through a predominantly Virgilian and Ovidian topos. Aelred called this &quot;marriage&quot; an &#x27;organ of experience&#x27;, with nothing to do with romantic or sexual reality which were believed to be fundamentally contrary to monastic life. Julia Kristeva argues that this is reflected much more accurately by the concept of &#x27;imaginatio&#x27; than &#x27;amor&#x27; (romantic love): &quot;It constituted the intimate link between being and the world, through which the person may assimilate the exterior world while also defining the self as a subject&quot;. McGuire notes that &quot;in the &quot;Life of Waldef&quot;, there is a colorful story about how a woman tried to tempt the budding Cistercian saint into bed, and how he resisted her. In the &quot;Life of Aelred,&quot; we find no such temptresses.&quot;

==Writings==
For his efforts in writing and administration Aelred was called by David Knowles the &quot;St. Bernard of the North.&quot; Knowles, a historian of monasticism in England, also described him as &quot;a singularly attractive figure,&quot; saying that &quot;No other English monk of the twelfth century so lingers in the memory.&quot;

All of Aelred&#x27;s works have appeared in translation, most in English and in French; the remaining three volumes of his sermons are being translated into English and will appear from Cistercian Publications in 2018–2020. There are already available in French in a five-volume edition.

<text>Wool is a large village, civil parish and electoral ward in south Dorset, England. In the 2011 census the parish – which includes Bovington Camp army base to the north – had 2,015 households and a population of 5,310. The village lies at a historic bridging point on the River Frome, halfway between Dorchester and Wareham. Woolbridge Manor House, a 17th-century building, is a prominent feature just outside the village and the location of Tess&#x27;s honeymoon in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;. Other prominent features of the village include the medieval church of Holy Rood, the railway station on the South West Main Line from London Waterloo to Weymouth, and the thatched cottages along Spring Street.

The place-name &#x27;Wool&#x27; is first attested in Anglo-Saxon Writs from 1002 to 1012, where it appears as &quot;Wyllon&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it appears as &quot;Wille&quot; and &quot;Welle&quot;, and as &quot;Welles&quot; in 1212 in the Book of Fees. The name means &#x27;springs&#x27; in the sense of the related word wells.

Near Wool, to the east of the village, are the ruins of Bindon Abbey, which was demolished in the Dissolution of the Monasteries of 1539, the stone being used to build castles in Portland, Lulworth and Sandsfoot.

According to local knowledge, only one building was destroyed during World War II, on 3 May 1941. The building was a small bungalow by the name of &quot;Two Birches&quot;, located on Bailey&#x27;s Drove. The house was later rebuilt.

A small single-lane hump-backed stone bridge, a Grade II* listed structure about 200m north from the railway station, is no longer used for vehicular traffic. The place name &quot;Wullebrigg&quot;, recorded in 1244, indicates a crossing here in the thirteenth century and there is an extant record from 1343 of a bridge crossing the River Frome at this point. It has a stone half-way along it stating that those who deface or damage the bridge will be transported (sent to Australia or another penal colony) for the rest of their lives. In January 2018 one of the bridge&#x27;s stone parapets collapsed, undermined by floodwater, but the arches remained undamaged.

Local places of interest include The Tank Museum and Monkey World. Nearby hamlets include East Burton and Giddy Green.

The village received significant media coverage in January 2012, after a fuel tanker crashed into the front of a bungalow, starting a fire. No-one was injured in the incident, but the tanker driver was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. It received further media coverage in November 2018, when animal rights group PETA requested that the village be renamed Vegan Wool, claiming that the village&#x27;s name &quot;promotes hideous animal cruelty&quot;, despite its true origins. The county council agreed to debate the issue. In December 2018, the council appeared to mock PETA on Twitter after repairs were carried out on Wool Bridge following erosion, tweeting, &quot;Look away veggie lovers, #Wool bridge is now looking meaty&quot;.

<doc id="737046" wikidata="Q167928" url="?curid=737046" title="Union of Greens and Farmers">
<text>The Union of Greens and Farmers (, ZZS) is an agrarian political alliance in Latvia. It is made up of the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union, Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party, and For Latvia and Ventspils.

It is positioned in the centre on the political spectrum, sometimes also described as a centre-right or a centre-left party. It is orientated towards agrarian, conservative, Eurosceptic, and green policies, and can be considered a centrist Nordic agrarian alliance, with nationalist and anti-liberal elements.

While the alliance&#x27;s formal leader is Edgars Tavars, its leading figure and chief financial supporter is the oligarch Aivars Lembergs. The ZZS has had the world&#x27;s first prime minister, Indulis Emsis (Prime Minister of Latvia in 2004), and first head of state, Raimonds Vējonis (President of Latvia 2015–19), to be affiliated with a green party.

==History==
The alliance was established to contest the 2002 parliamentary election by the Latvian Green Party (LZP) and Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union (LZS). It ran on an ideologically amorphous agenda and won 12 out of 100 seats in the parliament. In March 2004, Indulis Emsis from the LZP became the Prime Minister of Latvia until December of that year.

On a European level, the LZP cooperated with the European Green Party while the LZS has no formal affiliation. Before the 2004 European Parliament election, ZZS announced that if its representative was elected, he or she would join one of two political groups depending on which party they belonged to.

The alliance continued for the 2006 parliamentary election, and won 18 seats. It became part of the governing coalition, and LZP chairman Indulis Emsis, who served as Prime Minister briefly in 2004, became Speaker of the Saeima.

Aivars Lembergs was the candidate of the Union of Greens and Farmers for the position of Prime Minister in 2006, before being charged with corruption, fraud, bribery, money laundering and abuse of elected office on 20 July 2006. On 14 March 2007, Lembergs was detained by the Latvian authorities in relation to a criminal investigation.

At the 2014 European Parliament election, the ZZS won 8.3% of the vote and for the first time one of Latvia&#x27;s European Parliament seats. Its MEP is Iveta Grigule who initially sat with the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFFD) group. On 16 October 2014 Grigule defected from the EFDD to sit as an independent. This move required EFDD to co-opt a member of Poland&#x27;s Congress of the New Right to remain eligible for parliamentary group status. In April 2015 she joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group.

In the 2015 presidential election, the alliance&#x27;s then-leader Raimonds Vējonis became President of Latvia and subsequently resigned his leadership of the alliance. In January 2016, after the resignation of Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma, Liepāja Party member Māris Kučinskis became the head of government. After the 2018 Latvian parliamentary election, ZZS lost ten seats and ultimately in 2019 became a part of the opposition to the Kariņš cabinet. It stayed in opposition until 2023, when it became part of Evika Siliņa cabinet.

=== Split, change of members ===
In early 2022, the alliance started to break apart, with the Green Party announcing that it sees no way of further cooperation with For Latvia and Ventspils, still led by oligarch Aivars Lembergs, and ultimately on 11 June 2022 it voted to leave the alliance, later joined by the Liepāja Party. In July, the Greens and the Liepāja Party joined the Latvian Association of Regions and a political NGO led by construction contractor Uldis Pīlēns in forming the United List alliance.

The departing parties were replaced with the Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (LSDSP), a rival of the 1920s and 1930s, who joined ZZS on June 1 and allowed it to retain its name. The alliance once again announced Lembergs as their prime ministerial candidate. The list won 16 seats, with two going to LSDSP, who returned to the Saeima for the first time since 2002.

==Ideology==
The Union of Greens and Farmers is based on similar sentimental feelings shared by the voters of the two groups. Latvians are supportive of traditional small farms and perceive them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms. For example, after the restoration of independence, Latvia broke down Soviet-era collective farms and returned land to its original owners (or their descendants). This perception has resulted in an alliance between green and farmer&#x27;s parties, which is rare in other countries.

The alliance is Eurosceptic, although not opposed to Latvian membership of the European Union. The ZZS opposed the adoption of the euro by Latvia. The party opposes granting non-citizens Latvian citizenship or voting rights in local elections. 

On social issues, the party has taken a traditionally conservative approach, opposing same-sex marriage and instead favouring civil unions for same-sex couples. It supports abortion rights for up to 12 weeks of pregnancy and has voted to ratify the Istanbul Convention for preventing violence against women, despite having initially expressed skepticism over the convention’s use of the term “gender” and potential redefinition of marriage outside of that of a union of a man and a woman. However, the party is also environmentalist and follows green politics, stressing the need for sustainable and ecological economic policy, reducing environmental waste and for a transitation away from fossil fuel energy sources, in favor of renewable energy.

Economically, the party is populist, adhering to the principles of economic nationalism. It is also opposed to economic liberalism in favor of more redistributive policies. It opposes spending cuts, especially to welfare, pensions and healthcare - instead, the party proposes to extend the Latvian safety net, and promotes popular welfare measures.

<doc id="737057" wikidata="Q157425" url="?curid=737057" title="85 Io">
<text>85 Io is a carbonaceous asteroid in the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 170 kilometers in diameter. It is an identified Eunomian interloper.

== Discovery and naming ==

It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on 19 September 1865, and named after Io, a lover of Zeus in Greek mythology. Io is also the name of the volcanic satellite of Jupiter. With a two-digit number and a two-letter name, 85 Io has the shortest designation of all minor planets.

== Orbit and physical characteristics ==

Io is a retrograde rotator, with its pole pointing towards one of ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (-45°, 105°) or (-15°, 295°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of about 125° or 115°, respectively. Its shape is quite regular.

In the SMASS classification, &quot;Io&quot; is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid, which means that it is probably a primitive body composed of carbonates. Like 141 Lumen it is an interloper that orbits within the Eunomia asteroid family but it is not related to the shattered parent body.

An Ionian diameter of 178 kilometres was measured from an occultation of a star on 10 December 1995. Another asteroid occultation of Io (magnitude 13.2) occurred on 12 March 2009, from the eastern United States, with the star 2UCAC 35694429
(magnitude 13.8).

<text>86 Semele is a large and very dark main-belt asteroid with an orbital period of 5.5 years. It is rotating with a period of 16.6 hours, and varies in magnitude by 0.13 during each cycle. This object is classified as a C-type asteroid and is probably composed of carbonates.

Semele was discovered by German astronomer Friedrich Tietjen on 4 January 1866. It was his first and only asteroid discovery. It is named after Semele, the mother of Dionysus in Greek mythology.

The orbit of 86 Semele places it in a 13:6 mean motion resonance with the planet Jupiter. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is only 6,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets. This Lyapunov time is the second lowest among the first 100 named minor planets.

<doc id="737087" wikidata="Q1528306" url="?curid=737087" title="Toric variety">
<text>In algebraic geometry, a toric variety or torus embedding is an algebraic variety containing an algebraic torus as an open dense subset, such that the action of the torus on itself extends to the whole variety. Some authors also require it to be normal. Toric varieties form an important and rich class of examples in algebraic geometry, which often provide a testing ground for theorems. The geometry of a toric variety is fully determined by the combinatorics of its associated fan, which often makes computations far more tractable. For a certain special, but still quite general class of toric varieties, this information is also encoded in a polytope, which creates a powerful connection of the subject with convex geometry. Familiar examples of toric varieties are affine space, projective spaces, products of projective spaces and bundles over projective space. 

==Toric varieties from tori==

The original motivation to study toric varieties was to study torus embeddings. Given the algebraic torus formula_1, the group of characters formula_2 forms a lattice. Given a collection of points formula_3, a subset of this lattice, each point determines a map to formula_4 and thus the collection determines a map to formula_5. By taking the Zariski closure of the image of such a map, one obtains an affine variety. If the collection of lattice points formula_3 generates the character lattice, this variety is a torus embedding. In similar fashion one may produce a parametrized projective toric variety, by taking the projective closure of the above map, viewing it as a map into an affine patch of projective space.

Given a projective toric variety, observe that we may probe its geometry by one-parameter subgroups. Each one parameter subgroup, determined by a point in the lattice, dual to the character lattice, is a punctured curve inside the projective toric variety. Since the variety is compact, this punctured curve has a unique limit point. Thus, by partitioning the one-parameter subgroup lattice by the limit points of punctured curves, we obtain a lattice fan, a collection of polyhedral rational cones. The cones of highest dimension correspond precisely to the torus fixed points, the limits of these punctured curves.

==The toric variety of a fan==
===Affine toric variety and polyhedral cone===
Suppose that formula_7 is a finite-rank free abelian group, for instance the lattice formula_8. A strongly convex rational polyhedral cone in formula_7 is a convex cone (of the real vector space of formula_7) with apex at the origin, generated by a finite number of vectors of formula_7, and that contains no line through the origin. These will be called &quot;cones&quot; for short.
When generated by a set of vectors formula_12, it is denoted formula_13.
A one-dimensional cone is called a ray.
For a cone formula_14, its affine toric variety formula_15 is the spectrum of the monoid algebra of the dual cone to formula_14.

===Fundamental theorem for toric geometry===
A fan is a collection of cones closed under taking intersections and faces. The underlying space of a fan formula_17 is the union of its cones and is denoted by formula_18.

The toric variety of a fan of strongly convex rational cones is given by taking the affine toric varieties of its cones and gluing them together by identifying formula_15 with an open subvariety of formula_20 whenever formula_14 is a face of formula_22. The toric variety constructed from a fan is necessarily normal. Conversely, every toric variety has an associated fan of strongly convex rational cones. This correspondence is called the fundamental theorem for toric geometry, and it gives a one-to-one correspondence between normal toric varieties and fans of strongly convex rational cones.

The fan associated with a toric variety condenses some important data about the variety. For example, the Cartier divisors are associated to the rays of the fan. Moreover, a toric variety is smooth, or nonsingular, if every cone in its fan can be generated by a subset of a basis for the free abelian group formula_7, and it is compact if its fan is complete, that is, its underlying space is the whole vector space.

===Morphisms of toric varieties===

Suppose that formula_24 and formula_25 are fans in lattices formula_26 and formula_27, respectively. If formula_28 is a linear map from formula_26 to formula_27 such that the image of every cone of formula_24 is contained in a cone of formula_25, then formula_28 induces a morphism formula_34 between the corresponding toric varieties. This map formula_34 is proper if and only if the preimage of formula_36 under the map formula_28 is formula_38.

===Projective toric variety, the ones coming from polytopes===
A toric variety is projective if it can be embedded in some complex projective space.

Let formula_39 be a polytope. For any vertex formula_40 of formula_39, the normal cone of formula_39 at vertex formula_40 is the cone generated by the outer normals of the facets containing formula_40.
The normal fan of formula_39 is the fan whose maximal cones are the normal cones at each vertex of formula_39.

It is well known that projective toric varieties are the ones coming from the normal fans of rational polytopes. 

For example, the complex projective plane formula_47 comes from the triangle, or formula_48-simplex. It may be represented by three complex coordinates satisfying

:formula_49

where the sum has been chosen to account for the real rescaling part of the projective map, and the coordinates must be moreover identified by the following formula_50 action:

:formula_51

The approach of toric geometry is to write

:formula_52

The coordinates formula_53 are non-negative, and they parameterize a triangle because

:formula_54
that is,
:formula_55

The triangle is the toric base of the complex projective plane. The generic fiber is a two-torus parameterized by the phases of formula_56; the phase of formula_57 can be chosen real and positive by the formula_50 symmetry.

However, the two-torus degenerates into three different circles on the boundary of the triangle i.e. at formula_59 or formula_60 or formula_61 because the phase of formula_62 becomes inconsequential, respectively.

The precise orientation of the circles within the torus is usually depicted by the slope of the line intervals (the sides of the triangle, in this case).

Note that this construction is related to symplectic geometry as the map formula_63 is related to the moment map for the action of formula_50 on the symplectic manifold formula_47.

==Classification of smooth compact toric varieties==
From the fundamental theorem for toric geometry, the classification of smooth compact toric varieties of complex dimension formula_66 and with formula_67 Cartier divisors is equivalent to that of smooth complete fans of dimension formula_66 with formula_67 rays.

===Classification for small Picard number===
The Picard number of a fan formula_17 of dimension formula_66 having formula_67 rays is the quantity formula_73. Note that it is actually the rank of the Picard group of the toric variety associated to formula_17.

*The only toric variety of dimension formula_66 and Picard number formula_76 is the complex projective space formula_77. Its associated fan has rays generated by formula_78 and formula_79, for formula_78 a basis of formula_7. The cones of this fan are formula_82, and formula_83, for formula_84. This is the normal fan to a unimodular formula_66-simplex and it is therefore projective, even though this is a trivial statement.

*P. Kleinschmidt classified every smooth compact toric varieties of Picard number formula_48, they are all projective. 
*Victor V. Batyrev classified every smooth compact toric varieties of Picard number formula_87, they are all projective. This result was reproved by S. Choi and H. Park using different techniques.

The classification for Picard number greater than formula_87 is not known.

===Classification for small dimension===
Smooth toric surfaces are easily characterized, they all are projective and come from the normal fan of polygons such that at each vertex, the two incident edges are spanned by two vectors that form a basis of formula_89.

==Resolution of singularities==
Every toric variety has a resolution of singularities given by another toric variety, which can be constructed by subdividing the maximal cones of its associated fan into cones of smooth toric varieties.

== Relation to mirror symmetry ==
The idea of toric varieties is useful for mirror symmetry because an interpretation of certain data of a fan as data of a polytope leads to a combinatorial construction of mirror manifolds.

<text>Funyuns is the brand name of an onion-flavored corn extruded snack introduced in the United States in 1969, and invented by Frito-Lay employee George Wade Bigner. Funyuns consist primarily of cornmeal, ring-shaped using an extrusion process, representing the shape of fried onion rings. A salt and onion mix gives them their flavor. They are a product of PepsiCo&#x27;s Frito-Lay company. In Brazil, Funyuns are sold under the name &quot;Cebolitos&quot;.

==History==
They were named &quot;Funyuns&quot; by University of North Texas professor and copywriter Jim Albright after it was discovered that the first choice of name for the product, &quot;OnYums,&quot; was a registered trademark of Rudolph Foods. Initial television advertising for the snack featured a variation of Susan Christie&#x27;s 1966 song, &quot;I Love Onions.&quot;

Over the years, several recipes have come out that use Funyuns as an ingredient, including one using the product as a replacement for fried onions in green bean casserole and using the crushed snack food as a Thanksgiving turkey coating.

==Flavors==
* Original Funyuns (1969–present)
* Wasabi (2001–2002)
* Flamin&#x27; Hot (2007–present)
* Chilli &amp; Limón (2014–2018)
* Steakhouse Onion (2015–2018; 2024–present)

<text>Lambda Literary Awards, also known as the &quot;Lammys&quot;, are awarded yearly by Lambda Literary to recognize the crucial role LGBTQ+ writers play in shaping the world. The Lammys celebrate the very best in LGBTQ+ literature. The awards were instituted in 1989.

The program has grown from 14 awards in early years to 24 awards today. Early categories such as HIV/AIDS literature were dropped as the prominence of the AIDS crisis within the gay community waned, and categories for bisexual and transgender literature were added as the community became more inclusive.

In addition to the primary literary awards, Lambda Literary also presents a number of special awards.

==Award categories==

===Current===
====Notes====
1 In both the bisexual and transgender categories, presentation may vary according to the number of eligible titles submitted in any given year. If the number of titles warrants, then separate awards are presented in either two (Fiction and Nonfiction, with the Fiction category inclusive of poetry titles) or three (Fiction, Nonfiction and Poetry) categories, while if a smaller number of titles is deemed eligible, then a merged Literature shortlist is put forward. However, even when the category shortlists have been merged, judges still retain the right to identify a single winner in the unlisted category; for example, at the 25th Lambda Literary Awards in 2013 the judges named both fiction and non-fiction winners in the Bisexual Literature category, and at the 29th Lambda Literary Awards in 2017 the judges picked a title from the Bisexual Fiction shortlist as the winner in Bisexual Poetry despite the lack of an advance poetry shortlist.

====Tallies====
Ellen Hart has won five awards in the Lesbian Mystery category, the most by any single author, and is one of only three writers to have won the award more than once (with three-time winners Katherine V.

==Awards by year==
The Lambda Literary Awards are presented each year to honor works of literature published in the previous year; accordingly, the first awards ceremony may be described in different sources as either the 1989 awards (for the year of presentation) or the 1988 awards (for the year in which the nominated works were published).


==Controversies==

===Bisexual community and &quot;Bi Any Other Name&quot;===
In 1992, despite requests from the bisexual community for a more appropriate and inclusive category, the groundbreaking bisexual anthology &quot;Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out&quot; by Loraine Hutchins and Lani Kaʻahumanu was forced to compete, and lost, in the category &quot;Lesbian Anthology&quot;. Additionally, in 2005, &quot;Directed by Desire: Collected Poems&quot;, a posthumous collection of the bisexual Jamaican-American writer June Jordan&#x27;s work, competed (and won) in the category &quot;Lesbian Poetry&quot;.

Led by BiNet USA, and assisted by other bisexual organizations including the American Institute of Bisexuality, BiPOL, and Bialogue, the bisexual community launched a multi-year struggle that eventually culminated in 2006 with the addition of a Bisexual category.

===Transgender community and &quot;The Man Who Would Be Queen&quot;===
In 2004, the book &quot;The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism&quot; by the highly controversial researcher J. Michael Bailey was announced as a finalist in the Transgender category of the 2003 Awards.

Transgender people immediately protested the nomination and gathered thousands of petition signatures in opposition within a few days. After the petition, the Foundation&#x27;s judges examined the book more closely, decided that they considered it transphobic and removed it from their list of finalists. Within a year the executive director who had initially approved of the book&#x27;s inclusion resigned. Executive director Charles Flowers later stated that &quot;the Bailey incident revealed flaws in our awards nomination process, which I have completely overhauled since becoming the foundation’s executive director in January 2006.&quot;

<text>James Hannington (3 September 1847 – 29 October 1885) was an English Anglican missionary and martyr. He was the first Anglican bishop of East Africa.

==Early life==

Hannington was born on 3 September 1847 at Hurstpierpoint in Sussex, England, about eight miles from Brighton, where his father ran a warehouse, and was part of the family that ran Hanningtons department stores. His father, Charles Smith Hannington, had recently acquired the property known as St George&#x27;s. During his childhood, Hannington was a collector and he blew off his thumb with black powder.

For Hannington&#x27;s early education a tutor had been engaged, but when he was thirteen he was sent to the Temple School at Brighton, where he remained for the next two-and-a-half years, although he was an indifferent student.

Hannington left school at fifteen to work in his father&#x27;s Brighton counting house. He obtained a commission in the 1st Sussex Artillery Volunteer Corps in 1864 and rose to the rank of major. Under his training and supervision, his detachment won prizes at the annual camp competitions.

==Ministry==

The family were Congregationalists but joined the Church of England in 1867. In that year the chapel which Hannington&#x27;s father had built in the grounds of his property in 1852 was licensed for Anglican services. At twenty-one, Hannington decided to pursue a clerical career, and entered university at St Mary Hall, Oxford; he was President of the Red Club and captain of the St Mary Hall Boat. In 1872, the death of his mother spurred a change in Hannington&#x27;s life; he was awarded his BA, and on 1 March 1874 was made a deacon (by Frederick Temple, Bishop of Exeter, at Exeter Cathedral), and took a curacy of Martinhoe with Trentishoe, Devon. Having been ordained priest, in 1875 James became curate-in-charge at St George&#x27;s, Hurstpierpoint where he stayed until volunteering for missionary work in East Africa in 1882. He had by then been married for five years.

Around 1882, Hannington heard of the murder of two missionaries on the shores of Lake Victoria. This led to him offering himself to the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and he left England on 17 May, setting sail for Zanzibar on 29 June, as the head of a party of six missionaries. Crippled by fever and dysentery, Hannington was forced to return to England in 1883.On 24 June 1884 (St John the Baptist&#x27;s Day), having recovered, Hannington was ordained and consecrated a bishop by Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, at St Mary-at-Lambeth, to serve the See of Eastern Equatorial Africa, and in January 1885, at age thirty-seven, Hannington again departed for Africa. His diocese included missions of the CMS at the coast and inland in Buganda. While there Hannington collected a number of shells which were described by E. A. Smith in two papers in the &quot;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&quot;.

After arriving at Freretown, near Mombasa, in Kenya, Hannington determined to pioneer a shorter and healthier highland road to Buganda, using Christian porters and undercutting the Arab slave route to the south. He was oblivious to the political consequences of traversing Busoga, a strategically sensitive area for the Buganda state. The sudden intrusion of German imperialism at the coast made the Kabaka of Buganda Mwanga II, even more suspicious of Hannington&#x27;s motives. An oracle (&quot;emmandwa&quot;) had said that Buganda&#x27;s conqueror would come from the east. Mwanga forbade Hannington from continuing through Busoga and sent boats to take him to Sukumaland, but Hannington refused. Together with his team, he safely reached a spot near Lake Victoria on 21 October, but, under the orders of Mwanga II of Buganda, the missionaries were imprisoned in Busoga by Basoga chiefs.
After eight days of captivity, by order from Mwanga II, Hannington&#x27;s porters were killed, and on 29 October 1885, Hannington himself was speared in both sides. As he died, his alleged last words to the soldiers who killed him were: &quot;Go, tell Mwanga I have purchased the road to Uganda with my blood.&quot;

Alexander Murdoch Mackay, who had first-hand knowledge of events from the Buganda side, in letters dated 2 May 1886, wrote:

&quot;Had the matter of the Busoga route been the real point at issue, the king needed only to adopt our advice at the time, and request the Bishop to return to the neighbourhood of Kwa Sundu in Kavirondo, whither the boat had gone for him. But he was determined on shedding the blood of one whom he believed was a European of higher standing than merely an ordinary missionary or traveler, as &#x27;a challenge to the whole of Europe&#x27; as he said himself ... this case was absolutely unprovoked and unjustifiable on any ground, the extent of the crime being much increased by the fact that our brethren were coming after the King&#x27;s own repeated invitation, although they themselves were, perhaps, not aware of that fact. Further we gave the King perfectly to understand who they were, and why they came via the east, viz., to avoid the Germans&quot;

Widespread persecution of Christians followed, many being killed or sold to Arab slavers. Joseph Mukasa Balikuddembe, a Roman Catholic and an official at Mwanga&#x27;s court, rebuked the king for the deed, and was beheaded for it. Hannington and his companions were among the first Martyrs of Uganda.

The location of Hannington&#x27;s remains was divulged to Bishop Alfred Tucker in 1892 and on 31 December 1892, his remains were reburied at Namirembe. His tombstone His tombstone bear the inscription: &quot;FIRST BISHOP OF EASTERN EQUATORIAL AFRICA. MARTYRED IN BUSOGA ON 29th OCTOBER 1885 ON THE ORDER OF KABAKA MWANGA. HIS LAST WORDS WERE REPORTED TO BE &quot;TELL THE KING THAT I AM ABOUT TO DIE FOR BAGANDA AND I HAVE PURCHASED THE ROAD TO BAGANDA WITH MY LIFE&quot; &quot;HAPPY ARE THOSE WHO FROM NOW ON, DIE IN THE SERVICE OF THE LORD&quot; REV. 14;13

He is commemorated by the Hannington memorial chapel in Namirembe Cathedral, Kampala, Uganda.

James Hannington is honoured in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 29 October. A dedication stone, erected in his memory along with the Bishop Hannington Memorial Church, West Blatchington, Hove, England in 1938, bears the inscription &quot;Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy&quot;.

<text>The Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry was a professional basketball team based in Lawton, Oklahoma. They played in the Premier Basketball League (PBL) after having been in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). They have one PBL championship and also were the two-time champions of the CBA. The original team was known as the Oklahoma City Cavalry, which competed in the CBA in Oklahoma City from 1990 to 1997 – when they were league champions.

The new Oklahoma Cavalry, which was originally supposed to be a reincarnation of the original team and called the Oklahoma City Cavalry, began play in 2007. The team was originally scheduled to play in the American Basketball Association. The team wanted to play at Abe Lemons Arena on the campus of Oklahoma City University; however, the university backed out. Due to the lack of support from Oklahoma City and city officials&#x27; desire for a permanent NBA franchise, the owners decided to look elsewhere to place the new Cavalry franchise. The team then decided to move operations to Lawton, Oklahoma, and to play at the Great Plains Coliseum.

Less than one year later, Oklahoma City got their NBA team, the Oklahoma City Thunder.

== Head coach ==

The team was coached by Micheal Ray Richardson. Richardson was a former Albany Patroons coach and was fired for his offensive comments using Jewish stereotypes in the first year. Cliff Levingston was hired as the new coach. After an ownership change during the season, Richardson was rehired.

== 2007–2008 season ==

In their inaugural season, the Cavs compiled a 30–18 record and made the playoffs as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. Following an upset win in the Western Conference championship game over the two-time defending CBA champion Yakima Sun Kings, the Cavalry earned a bid in the CBA Finals against the Eastern Conference champion Minot SkyRockets, where they won the series three games to two.

Starting with the CBA Finals, the team changed its name to the Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry to better associate the team with the city they play in.

== 2008–2009 season ==

Due to economic hardships, the 2008–2009 CBA season was shortened to February 3. The best of 3 CBA Finals pitted the No. 2 seeded Albany Patroons against the No. 1 seeded Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry. However, due to the economy, all the games would be played in Albany. The Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry won their 2nd straight CBA championship 2 games to 1. This CBA championship was won in overtime to the score of 109–107. This was the first time in 16 years that a CBA championship was decided in overtime.

== 2009–2010 season ==

In August 2009, the Cavalry announced they would join the Premier Basketball League for the 2010 season. They would compile a record of 19–2, and enter the playoffs the No. 1 seed. First, they dispatched the Halifax Rainmen in 2 games. Then, they would advance to play the Rochester Razorsharks, who had just eliminated the No. 2 seed Puerto Rico Capitanes, for the PBL Finals. They lost Game 1 in Rochester 110–106, and would also have C Oliver Miller ejected and suspended for the remainder of the series for entering the stands to confront fans that were throwing items at Micheal Ray Richardson, who was moments earlier ejected from the game. However, the Cavalry would recover, easily taking the final 2 games of the series. With this Championship, the Cavalry have now won 3 Championships in their 3 years of existence in Lawton, having won 2 previous titles in the CBA.

== 2010–2011 season ==

The Lawton-Ft. Sill Cavalry finished the 2010–2011 regular season with a 17–2 record. The team advanced to the first round of the PBL playoffs vs. the Halifax Rainmen. A loss to the Halifax Rainmen in the PBL first round of playoffs on April 7, 2011, ended the Cavalry home win streak at 33 games dating back to when they played in the CBA. The Cavalry won the next two games advancing to the PBL finals which set up a rematch of the 2010 PBL finals vs. Rochester Razorsharks.

The Rochester Razorsharks won the first game of the best of 3 championship series 105–101 in Rochester on April 15, 2011. Suspect officiating had marred the Razorsharks&#x27;s ascent to the championship, which continued in the series. Rochester eventually won the PBL Championship two games to one, prompting the Lawton Constitution to report that the Cavalry had dropped out of the PBL.

On April 19, 2011, the Cavalry announced that the team would not be returning to the PBL for a third season. The next day the Cavalry owners announced that they were suspending operations, with not being able to find a suitable league to continue as one of the factors.

<text>Knight Lore is a 1984 action-adventure game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game, and written by company founders Chris and Tim Stamper. The game is known for its use of isometric graphics, which it further popularized in video games. In &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, the player character Sabreman has forty days to collect objects throughout a castle and brew a cure to his werewolf curse. Each castle room is depicted in monochrome on its own screen and consists of blocks to climb, obstacles to avoid, and puzzles to solve.

Ultimate released &quot;Knight Lore&quot; third in the Sabreman series but later claimed to have completed it first and withheld its release for a year to position the company advantageously in anticipation of the game&#x27;s effect on the market. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; novel image masking technique, Filmation, let images appear to pass atop and behind each other without their contents colliding. This created the illusion of depth priority, which the computer did not natively support. By delaying &quot;Knight Lore&quot; release, Ultimate protected sales of their then-upcoming &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; and created another Filmation game before other developers could copy the style. Ultimate released the original &quot;Sabreman&quot; trilogy in quick succession in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; came last, in November. Ports followed for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, MSX, and Family Computer Disk System. 

&quot;Knight Lore&quot; is regarded as a seminal work in British video game history and has been included in multiple lists of top Spectrum games. Critics considered its technical solutions and isometric 3D style a harbinger of future game design. They praised the game&#x27;s controls and atmosphere of mystery, but noted its difficult gameplay and criticised its sound and occasional graphical slowdown. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; was named the 1984 game of the year by the Golden Joystick Awards and &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot; readers. Though it was not the first isometric 3D video game, &quot;Knight Lore&quot; popularised the format. When the isometric, flip-screen style fell out of fashion, &quot;Knight Lore&quot; influence persisted in computer role-playing games. Retrospective reviewers remember the game as the first to offer an exploratory &quot;world&quot; rather than a flat surface, but consider its controls outdated and frustrating in the thirty years since its release.

The game was later included in compilations including Rare&#x27;s 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, &quot;Rare Replay&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
The player, as Sabreman, has been bitten by the Sabre Wulf and now transforms into a werewolf at nightfall. He has 40 days to collect items throughout Melkhior the Wizard&#x27;s castle and brew a cure for his curse. An onscreen timer shows the progression of day into night, when Sabreman metamorphoses into a werewolf, returning to human form at sunrise. Some of the castle&#x27;s monsters only attack Sabreman when he is a werewolf. The game ends if the player completes the potion or does not finish the task in forty days. The game&#x27;s only directions are given through a poem included with the game&#x27;s cassette tape.

The castle consists of a series of 128 rooms, each displayed on a single, non-scrolling screen. Sabreman must navigate the 3D maze of stone blocks in each room, usually to retrieve a collectible object, whilst avoiding spikes and enemies, which kill him on contact. The player starts with five lives, and loses one for each death; running out of lives ends the game. Stone blocks serve as platforms for the player to jump between; some fall under the player&#x27;s weight, some move of their own accord, and some can be pushed by enemies or Sabreman. Sabreman jumps higher when in werewolf form, which helps in specific puzzles. The player often needs to move blocks to reach distant objects, which are then used as platforms to reach areas in other puzzles. To complete the game, the player must return 14 sequential objects from throughout the castle to the wizard&#x27;s cauldron room. At the end of the game, the player receives a final score based on the remaining time and amount of the quest completed.

== Development ==
Ultimate Play the Game, represented by its co-founding brothers, Tim and Chris Stamper, was uncommonly taciturn in matters of press and marketing, though they provided some details on &quot;Knight Lore&quot; development to &quot;Crash&quot; magazine. While &quot;Knight Lore&quot; was released as the third game in the Sabreman series, the Stamper brothers later claimed to have finished it first, saying they withheld the game for about a year for market reasons: they thought that &quot;Knight Lore&quot; advancements—copyrighted as the Filmation engine—would hurt sales of their then-upcoming &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot;, and used the extra time to prepare another Filmation game (&quot;Alien 8&quot;) to preempt the sales that would be lost when other publishers would try to copy the technique. Tim Stamper recalled that &quot;we just had to sit on it because everyone else was so far behind&quot;. More recent research has suggested this may have been an exaggeration as the coding routines found in &quot;Knight Lore&quot; are far more optimised than those used in the earlier games. &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; was released to commercial and critical success in 1984. The next two Sabreman titles—&quot;Underwurlde&quot; and &quot;Knight Lore&quot;—followed in close succession before the end of the year.

Filmation and &quot;Knight Lore&quot; graphical novelty lay in how images could render without overlapping. Filmation introduced &quot;masked sprites&quot; whereas earlier games used &quot;planar sprites&quot;, which overlapped without regard for depth order. Chris Stamper&#x27;s solution was to use image masking. A mask is a version of an image that defines a background from the subject matter in different colours. When combining the mask and the on-screen composite image, the mask&#x27;s &quot;background&quot; data was ignored and a hole in the shape of the desired image sprite was added to the background. This was filled in with the sprite&#x27;s details. Thus, rooms in &quot;Knight Lore&quot; were drawn one sprite at a time through this masking method. In more recent times, contemporary images render with layer priority set at the individual pixel level. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; is depicted in monochrome that changes between rooms so as to avoid attribute clash, a computing limitation wherein an object&#x27;s colour interfered with those of others in close proximity.

Ultimate released &quot;Knight Lore&quot; for the ZX Spectrum in November 1984. In a press release, they announced the game as the beginning of a new class of adventure games and &quot;the very pinnacle of software development on the 48K Spectrum&quot;. As standard for the cryptic company, Ultimate did not circulate screenshots of the game in its press materials or cover art. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; was subsequently released for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, and MSX later in 1985. The Amstrad version upgraded the monochromatic colouring to a two-colour foreground setup. Jaleco released versions of &quot;Knight Lore&quot; for MSX and, later, the Famicom Disk System. The latter 1986 release barely resembled its namesake. Ultimate asked Shahid Ahmad, who developed the &quot;Knight Lore&quot;-inspired &quot;Chimera&quot; (1985), to develop a &quot;Knight Lore&quot; port for the Commodore 64, but this did not come to fruition. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; later appeared in the Spectrum version of the 1986 compilation &quot;They Sold a Million II&quot; and the 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30 Ultimate and Rare titles &quot;Rare Replay&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Knight Lore&quot; entered the UK video game charts in the week up to 8 November 1984 while &quot;Underwurlde&quot; was still number 1, and went on to replace its predecessor at the top of the charts the following week. By the start of 1985 it had been succeeded by &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;.

Computer game magazines lauded &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, writing that its graphics were the first of its kind and marked a sea change from its contemporaries. &quot;Computer &amp; Video Games&quot; (&quot;CVG&quot;) wrote that they had never seen graphics of its calibre and that it lived up to Ultimate&#x27;s hype. Peter Sweasey of &quot;Home Computing Weekly&quot; was left speechless and predicted that &quot;Knight Lore&quot; would change the market. &quot;Crash&quot; said it was unlikely to be surpassed as the Spectrum&#x27;s best game. &quot;Crash&quot; selected &quot;Knight Lore&quot; as a &quot;Crash Smash&quot; recommendation in its January 1985 issue. &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot; readers named &quot;Knight Lore&quot; their 1984 arcade game and overall game of the year. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; was also named &quot;CVG&quot; game of the year at their 1985 Golden Joystick Awards event, and Ultimate was named both developer and programmer of the year.

&quot;Knight Lore&quot; atmosphere, which &quot;Sinclair User&quot; described as a &quot;crepuscular world of claustrophobic menace&quot;, inspired many curious questions on the part of the adventurer in contemporaneous 1985 reviews. &quot;Crash&quot; appreciated the imaginative mystery of the game as they attempted to answer why Sabreman turns into a werewolf, who they preferred to play as, and what the collectible objects throughout the castle do. Sabreman&#x27;s werewolf transformation sequence, in particular, annoyed &quot;CVG&quot; and traumatised players, according to &quot;Well Played&quot;, a book of academic close readings of video games, as players empathised with the suffering Sabreman. The game design gave the impression that the castle was far grander in scale than it was in reality, and &quot;Crash&quot; wrote that the game&#x27;s novel eight-way direction scheme suited the 3D space. &quot;Crash&quot; compared &quot;Knight Lore&quot; stylistically to the 1984 &quot;Avalon&quot;, but suggested that the former had bolder visuals. The magazine preferred &quot;Knight Lore&quot; to its predecessor (&quot;Underwurlde&quot;) and one critic even considered the former to be Ultimate&#x27;s best game.

&quot;Crash&quot; noted how &quot;Knight Lore&quot; masking technique addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and &quot;Sinclair User&quot; appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered &quot;Knight Lore&quot; sound to be its weakest component, though &quot;Your Spectrum&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot; also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running timer, and the game&#x27;s animations would slow down proportional to the degree of onscreen action.

In reviews of the Amstrad release, &quot;Amtix&quot; noted the colour additions over the monochromatic original and wrote that &quot;Knight Lore&quot; was among the Amstrad&#x27;s best adventures. Their one complaint was the graphical slowdown when too many elements were moving onscreen. &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; shared this complaint but nevertheless named &quot;Knight Lore&quot; among the Amstrad&#x27;s best three games—an improvement on the Spectrum release and on par with the quality of Commodore 64 titles.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Knight Lore&quot; is widely regarded as a seminal work in British gaming history. According to Kieron Gillen of &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot;, &quot;Knight Lore&quot; is second only to &quot;Elite&quot; (1984) as an icon of the 1980s British computer game industry. British magazine &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; described players&#x27; first impressions of &quot;Knight Lore&quot; as &quot;unforgettable&quot;, on par with the experience of playing &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985), &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992), or &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996) for the first time. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; recalled that &quot;Knight Lore&quot; striking, isometric 3D visuals were both a bold advance in game graphics and a foretelling of their future. British magazine &quot;Edge&quot; described the game&#x27;s graphics engine as &quot;the single greatest advance in the history of video games&quot;, and &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; compared the engine&#x27;s impact to that of the introduction of sound in film. &quot;Knight Lore&quot; was not the first to use isometric graphics—earlier examples include &quot;Zaxxon&quot; (1982), &quot;Q*bert&quot; (1982), and &quot;Ant Attack&quot; (1983)—but its graphic style and large in-game world further popularised the technique and put Ultimate and Filmation in its epicentre.

Several video game clones were inspired by &quot;Knight Lore&quot;. When programmers at The Edge struggled to replicate the isometric style, visiting developer Bo Jangeborg devised his own solution. The result, &quot;Fairlight&quot; (1985), is regarded as another classic of the platform. The Edge&#x27;s version of Filmation received its own branding as &quot;Worldmaker&quot;. Shahid Ahmad said Firebird&#x27;s &quot;Chimera&quot; (1985) was even closer to &quot;Knight Lore&quot;. Ahmad&#x27;s &quot;shock&quot; and &quot;admiration&quot; from playing &quot;Knight Lore&quot; reportedly changed his life and convinced him to continue making games. He released &quot;Chimera&quot; on the Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum, customising each port for the processing limitations of its hardware. By 1986, many British video game publishers had produced &quot;Knight Lore&quot;-style isometric games; examples include &quot;Sweevo&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Movie&quot;, &quot;Quazatron&quot;, &quot;Get Dexter&quot;, &quot;Glider Rider&quot;, &quot;Molecule Man&quot;, &quot;Spindizzy&quot;, and &quot;Bobby Bearing&quot;. Many of these titles suffered the same slowdown issues as &quot;Knight Lore&quot; due to too much on-screen activity.

Ultimate itself released four more Filmation games. &quot;Alien 8&quot; (1985) was rushed for release before developers had an opportunity to react to &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, though &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; said that its rush was not noticeable, as &quot;Alien 8&quot; had a larger game world than &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, with even more puzzles. &quot;Alien 8&quot; and &quot;Knight Lore&quot; are similar in gameplay, but the former is set in outer space. With the updated Filmation II engine, &quot;Nightshade&quot; (1985) added colour and scrolling graphics (in place of flip-screen room changes); however, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; regarded its gameplay as comparatively dull. &quot;Gunfright&quot; (1986), reported as the Stampers&#x27; last game, also used Filmation II and was more robust than its predecessor. &quot;Pentagram&quot; (1986) returned to flip-screen rooms and its action-based gameplay included shooting enemies. It sold poorly and was the last Sabreman game. Meanwhile, the Stamper brothers sought to enter the burgeoning console industry. They sold Ultimate to U.S. Gold in the mid-1980s and established Rare to develop Nintendo console games. While Ultimate&#x27;s last two isometric games were of lesser quality, consumer interest in the genre endured.

The isometric, flip-screen trend continued in Britain for several years. Apart from &quot;Fairlight&quot;, &quot;Sweevo&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Get Dexter&quot;, other isometric flip-screen games included Jon Ritman&#x27;s &quot;Knight Lore&quot;-inspired &quot;Batman&quot; (1986), &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (1987), &quot;The Last Ninja&quot; (1987), &quot;La Abadía del Crimen&quot; (1987), &quot;Cadaver&quot; (1990), and console games &quot;Solstice&quot; (1990) and &quot;Landstalker&quot; (1992). As players grew tired of the genre&#x27;s similar reiterations, Ritman&#x27;s games, in particular, brought new ideas. Sandy White, who developed the pre-&quot;Knight Lore&quot; isometric game &quot;Ant Attack&quot;, was impressed by Ultimate&#x27;s in-game &quot;balance&quot; and gutsy design decisions. The developer of &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, another isometric game, considered &quot;Knight Lore&quot; to be more &quot;a rival title than an inspiration&quot;, but it still spurred him to spend nine months making &quot;Where Time Stood Still&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; wrote that &quot;Knight Lore&quot; influence persisted 30 years later through titles such as &quot;Populous&quot; (1989), &quot;Syndicate&quot; (1993), &quot;&quot; (1994), and &quot;Civilization II&quot; (1996). The style also spread to computer role-playing games like &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Diablo&quot;, and &quot;Fallout&quot;. Though &quot;GamesRadar&quot; Matt Cundy reported in 2009 that isometric perspective was no longer as prominent a topic in game design, in 2014, Chris Scullion of &quot;Vice&quot; traced &quot;Knight Lore&quot; isometric influence to &quot;The Sims 4&quot; (2014) and &quot;Diablo III&quot; (2012).

&quot;Knight Lore&quot; was included in multiple lists of top Spectrum games and top games for any platform. It inspired two fangames: a 1999 sequel and a 2010 3D remake, which was in development for four years.

Though isometric games had existed previously, in a retrospective review, Gillen (&quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot;) recalled that &quot;Knight Lore&quot; was the first game to offer a &quot;world&quot; with physical depth for exploration as opposed to the simple mechanics of arcade games. Jeremy Signor of &quot;USgamer&quot; agreed that &quot;Knight Lore&quot; felt more like a world than a painting and added that the game&#x27;s innovative use of successive, single-screen rooms (&quot;flip-screen&quot;) pre-dated &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; by years. Gillen said the game&#x27;s punishing style (unforgiving gameplay, high difficulty, awkward controls) had become obsolete in the 30 years since its release and criticised &quot;Knight Lore&quot; as &quot;enormously innovative, incredibly atmospheric, and totally unplayable&quot;, suggesting that the similar &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (1987) had aged much better. Peter Parrish (&quot;Eurogamer&quot;), too, found the game frustrating, though well-made. Dan Whitehead of the same publication appreciated that the 2015 &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation version of &quot;Knight Lore&quot; emulated the original&#x27;s choppy animations as the ZX Spectrum&#x27;s processor once struggled to render the onscreen objects.

<text>Francis Eugene George (January 16, 1937 – April 17, 2015) was an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He was the eighth archbishop of the Archdiocese of Chicago in Illinois (1997–2014) and previously served as bishop of the Diocese of Yakima in Washington State and archbishop of the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon.

A member of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, George was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 1998. He served as president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) from 2007 to 2010.

On September 20, 2014, Pope Francis accepted George&#x27;s resignation and appointed Bishop Blase J. Cupich to succeed him as Archbishop of Chicago. In this unusual circumstance, George was permitted to remain as the incumbent archbishop until Cupich was installed to succeed him on November 18, 2014. George was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and died from the disease in 2015.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Francis George was born on January 16, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, to Francis J. and Julia R. (née McCarthy) George. He had an older sister, Margaret. He received his early education at the parochial school of St. Pascal Parish in Chicago&#x27;s Northwest Side.

George contracted polio at age 13, leaving him with a permanent limp. Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago, rejected George for admission due to his limp. He instead enrolled at St. Henry Preparatory Seminary in Belleville, Illinois, a high school seminary of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. He joined the Oblates on August 14, 1957. He continued his studies at the Oblates novitiate in Godfrey, Illinois, before entering Our Lady of the Snows Seminary in Pass Christian, Mississippi.

George was then sent to study theology at the University of Ottawa in Canada. He made his solemn vows as a member of the Oblates on September 8, 1961.

=== Priesthood ===
On December 21, 1963, George was ordained to the priesthood for the Oblates by Bishop Raymond Hillinger at St. Pascal Church. After his ordination, he received a Bachelor of Theology degree in Ottawa in 1964.

George then entered the Catholic University of American in Washington, D.C., receiving a Master of Theology degree in 1965. George then taught philosophy at Our Lady of the Snows Seminary (1964 to 1969), Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana (1968), and Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska (1969 to 1973).

During his teaching assignments, George earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in American philosophy from Tulane University in 1970, and a Master of Theology degree from the University of Ottawa in 1971. He served as provincial superior of the Midwestern Province for the Oblates in Saint Paul, Minnesota, from 1973 until 1974, when he became the Oblates vicar general. Based in Rome, George served as vicar general for 12 years. He obtained a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree from the Pontifical Urbaniana University in 1988, with a thesis entitled: &quot;Inculturation and communion&quot;.

George returned to the United States, where he served as coordinator of the Circle of Fellows at the Center for the Study of Faith and Culture in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1987 to 1990).

=== Bishop of Yakima ===
On July 10, 1990, George was appointed the fifth bishop of Yakima by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on September 21, 1990, from Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan, with Bishops Roger Schwietz and William S. Skylstad serving as co-consecrators, at Holy Family Church in Yakima. George took as his episcopal motto: &quot;Christo Gloria in Ecclesia&quot; (Latin: &quot;To Christ be Glory in the Church&quot;).

George served as bishop of Yakima for five and a half years. As a member of the USCCB, he served as chair of the Commission for Bishops and Scholars (1992 to 1994), and as a consultant to the Committees on Evangelization (1991 to 1993), Hispanic Affairs (1994 to 1997), and Science and Values (1994 to 1997). 

George was an episcopal advisor to the Cursillo Movement (Region XII) from 1990 to 1997, and episcopal moderator of the National Catholic Office for Persons with Disabilities from 1990 to 2008. He was a papal appointee to the 1994 World Synod of Bishops on Consecrated Life, and attended the Ninth Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Vatican City in 1994.

=== Archbishop of Portland ===
On April 30, 1996, George was appointed the ninth archbishop of the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon by John Paul II. He was installed on the following May 27 at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Portland, Oregon. During his brief tenure, he led the archdiocese&#x27;s response to a tape recording by the Lane County jail of an inmate&#x27;s sacramental confession; the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later ruled that the tape recording was an unconstitutional and illegal act.

=== Archbishop of Chicago ===
On April 8, 1997, John Paul II appointed George as the eighth archbishop of Chicago, filling the vacancy left by the death of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin on November 14, 1996. George was the first native Chicagoan to become archbishop there. On May 7, 1997, Apostolic Pro-Nuncio Agostino Cacciavillan installed George as archbishop of Chicago in Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago.

On January 18, 1998, John Paul II announced George&#x27;s elevation to the College of Cardinals with the title of cardinal-priest of Basilica of San Bartolomeo all&#x27;Isola in Rome. His elevation occurred at the consistory at the Vatican on February 21st.

George addressed the archdiocese&#x27;s annual Theology on Tap gathering in 1997. In his invitation to the event, he wrote, &quot;You are very important members of the Church. Your energy, talent and faith will give me much help as together we build up our local Church to be a vital presence in the Chicago area. Together we can continue the mission of Jesus Christ to bring the Gospel of love, forgiveness and holiness to all the places where we live and encounter others.&quot;As a cardinal elector, George participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI and the papal conclave of 2013 that selected Pope Francis.

In 2009, George met with newly-elected U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2010, George finished his three-year presidency of the USCCB.

In 2011, George terminated the foster care program of Catholic Charities in the archdiocese. The State of Illinois had ruled that it would stop funding any charities that disqualified same-sex couples as foster care providers or adoptive parents. George refused to comply with this new requirement.

== Viewpoints ==

===Interfaith relations===
In 2007, George asked Jewish theologians to reconsider descriptions of Jesus in the Talmud as a &quot;bastard&quot;. In turn, Catholic theologians should examine a softening of traditional Catholic prayers calling for the conversion of Jews to Christianity. In 2009, he condemned comments made by Bishop Richard Williamson denying the existence of the Holocaust.

=== Religious freedom ===

In February 2010, George spoke at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, about the need for Catholics and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) to protect religious freedom. George also praised the LDS for its efforts to combat poverty, pornography and single-sex marriage.

George further outlined in 2010 how he believed religious freedoms in the United States and other Western societies were endangered. In a speech to a group of priests, he said, &quot;I expect to die in bed, my successor will die in prison and his successor will die a martyr in the public square. His successor will pick up the shards of a ruined society and slowly help rebuild civilization, as the church has done so often in human history.&quot; The quote was originally published online without the second sentence. In a 2014 interview, George said:

===LGBTQ rights===
When a new route was proposed for the 2012 annual Chicago Pride Parade that would take it past a Catholic church, George told an interviewer: &quot;you don&#x27;t want the Gay Liberation Movement to morph into something like the Ku Klux Klan, demonstrating in the streets against Catholicism.&quot; In response, LGBT advocates in Chicago called for George&#x27;s resignation, but George said: &quot;When the pastor&#x27;s request for reconsideration of the plans was ignored, the organizers invited an obvious comparison to other groups who have historically attempted to stifle the religious freedom of the Catholic Church.&quot; Two weeks later, George apologized: &quot;This has evidently wounded a good number of people. I have family members myself who are gay and lesbian, so it&#x27;s part of our lives. So I&#x27;m sorry for the hurt.&quot; He said he was &quot;speaking out of fear that I have for the church&#x27;s liberty and I was reaching for an analogy which was very inappropriate ...Sometimes fear is a bad motivation.&quot; LGBT rights advocates accepted his apology.

In a 2013 a pastoral letter to the Archdiocese of Chicago, George stated that the passage of a same-sex marriage legislation in Illinois, which appeared imminent, would be &quot;acting against the common good of society. This proposed legislation will have long-term consequences because laws teach; they tell us what is socially acceptable and what is not, and most people conform to the dictates of their respective society, at least in the short run&quot;.

In September 2014, in his column in &quot;The Catholic New World&quot;, George alleged that the US Government and society were now approving sexual relationships so at odds with Catholic teaching that &quot;the church&#x27;s teaching on these issues is now evidence of intolerance for what the civil law upholds and even imposes&quot; and that &quot;those who do not conform to the official religion, we are warned, place their citizenship in danger.&quot; He also cited the requirements of the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act. He wrote that:In September 2014, George met with a gay music director of a Catholic parish who had been fired after announcing his intention to marry his partner. The man said of the meeting: &quot;I was just again grateful for the opportunity to meet with him, for him to know me, for him to hear my story. ...I think the overall tone was again pastoral.&quot;

George was diagnosed with an aggressive but localized form of bladder cancer in 2006. In August 2012, the archdiocese announced that his bladder cancer had metastasized to his kidney and liver, and that he would undergo chemotherapy. The cancer returned in March 2014 and George started another round of chemotherapy. He was hospitalized for several days at Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago after showing flu-like symptoms and signs of dehydration.

==Legacy==
===Tributes===
One of George&#x27;s wishes had been to visit Pope Francis before he died, which proved impossible. While George was always careful to express his overall agreement with and obedience to Francis, he said himself that he was confused by what signals Francis was sending. Upon hearing of his death, Francis sent a telegram of condolence to Cupich:

The Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, also sent Cupich a telegram of condolence.

<doc id="737147" wikidata="Q2525984" url="?curid=737147" title="Hey You, Pikachu!">
<text>Hey You, Pikachu! is a virtual pet &quot;Pokémon&quot; spin-off video game for the Nintendo 64 developed by Ambrella and published by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on December 12, 1998, and in North America on November 6, 2000. The player is asked to help Professor Oak test the PokéHelper, a device that lets humans communicate with Pokémon. The game is set in the Kanto region between Pewter City and Viridian City, where the player is introduced to a wild Pikachu. The player is able to communicate with a 256-word database through the Voice Recognition Unit (VRU), a Nintendo 64 hardware accessory that, when paired with a microphone, can comprehend and analyze human speech. Along with speaking with Pikachu, the VRU allows the player to move around and gather items.

&quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot; is one of only two games to utilize the VRU, with the other being &quot;Densha de Go! 64&quot;, the Japan-exclusive N64 port of &quot;Densha de Go! 2 Kōsoku-hen&quot;. The game had a mixed reception from critics. Though no direct sequels have been made, the virtual pet game &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot;, first released for the GameCube in 2003, resembles &quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot; and shares similar gameplay, with the exception of the microphone peripheral.

==Gameplay==
The main character is asked to test out the PokéHelper, a new device of Professor Oak&#x27;s that is used to talk to Pokémon. The player then meets a wild Pikachu and befriends it. Once the player earns Pikachu&#x27;s trust, it will come and live in the player&#x27;s house. There are three different activity days: Pikachu&#x27;s Daring Days, Discovery Days, and Play Days. Each day has a different objective (e.g. collecting food, going fishing) and the player can earn Pika Points, the currency used at Abra&#x27;s Shop to unlock new items.

After 365 gameplay days, Professor Oak notifies the player that Pikachu, still a wild Pokémon, must be released. The player ventures to the woods to find Pikachu and repeatedly says &quot;goodbye&quot;, upon which Pikachu realizes it must return to the wild. After the credits, while the player looks around the front yard and reminisces, Pikachu returns, and the game continues as if Pikachu was never released.

==Development==
&quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot; was first demonstrated at Nintendo Space World &#x27;97. Originally, the game was to be titled &quot;Pikachu VRS&quot; in North America, but it was changed for marketability reasons.

==Reception==
&quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot; received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;″s Dustin Packwood commented that fans of the anime would enjoy this game. &quot;NextGen&quot;″s Greg Orlando, however, said that the game &quot;tastes just like chicken made of glucose.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; stated, &quot;If you&#x27;re a little kid or a big kid with a little kid&#x27;s love for &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Hey, You, Pikachu&quot; is calling for you.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 30 out of 40.

&quot;Retronauts&quot; cited the game as an example of a terrible &quot;Pokémon&quot; console game. &quot;UGO Networks&quot; listed the game on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Games That Belong On the 3DS&quot;, stating &quot;Using the 3DS&#x27; built-in microphone should make it simple to speak and interact with the wild Pokémon.&quot;

The game was nominated for the &quot;Console Family&quot; award at the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; that award ultimately was given to &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;.

==Legacy==

A spiritual sequel to &quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot;, was first released on the GameCube in 2003 and was also developed by Ambrella. Another spiritual sequel, &quot;PokéPark Wii: Pikachu&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, was first released on the Wii in 2009, which in turn had its direct sequel, &quot;PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond&quot;, first released in 2011.

<text>The SS &quot;Cap Lopez was a 758 GRT [[cargo ship]] that was built in 1885 as Rheinland&quot;. She was sold in 1905 and renamed, and became stranded on the south Goodwin Sands on 21 December 1907.

==History==
&quot;Cap Lopez&quot; was built in 1885 by H Hespe of Brake, Lower Saxony. She was originally named &quot;Rheinland&quot;. She was built for Rabien and Stadtlander, Brake. In 1905 she was sold to Société Anonyme du SS Cap Lopez and was renamed &quot;Cap Lopez&quot; (after the African cape). She was managed by F Siebert. In 1907, &quot;Cap Lopez&quot; was sold to Société Anonyme de Navigation Mercure, Antwerp. She was wrecked on the South Goodwin Sands on 20 December 1907. At the time of her wreck she was carrying a cargo of iron ore and salt from Mazarrón, Spain to Antwerp.

==Shipwreck==
Regardless of the efforts made to save the ship, it ultimately became a total loss. G.B. Bayley, a Deal boatman, said that the wind was blowing hard W.S.W., and the sea was correspondingly heavy. The &quot;Charles Hargrave&quot; of Kingsdown was launched at 2.30 AM in response to distress signals being fired.

&quot;Finding the vessel fast aground she anchored to windward and veered down alongside, when the Captain asked the Coxswain to do his best to salve her.&quot; Against the prevailing weather an attempt was just possible, and the Walmer lifeboat arrived shortly afterwards to assist in the attempt. As was usual in such difficult conditions, a complement of men from each of the lifeboats boarded the wreck, an anchor being laid out in a suitable place. Only then could the task of throwing over the side an amount of the cargo begin, but the worsening weather made this attempt to lighten the ship futile. With the tide making, and the wind increasing to a fierce gale, the sea became so heavy that it became clear the ship would have to be abandoned.

Shortly afterwards, &quot;a great towering sea struck the Walmer lifeboat, broke the rope connecting her with the vessel, smashed her rudder and other parts of her steering gear, and carried her far away to leeward in a helpless condition with about half her crew aboard the stranded ship, over which the seas were by now making a clean breach.&quot; (Treanor)

With the Walmer lifeboat disabled, the task fell to the men of Kingsdown to take off the ship&#x27;s crew and the Walmer boatmen. In the attempt to veer close enough to accomplish this, the lifeboat was raised clear above the wreck, and in descending she was struck heavily by a part of the upper structure of the ship, narrowly escaping total destruction. The next heavy sea cleared the Kingsdown lifeboat, which, having been damaged, returned to the attempt. ‘The men who were there (said) the escape was miraculous’. So fierce had conditions become that many of those stranded upon the ‘Cap Lopez’ had no other recourse other than to take to the rigging, and from there to jump for the lifeboat whenever the opportunity presented itself. By this means, and at great length, all aboard were rescued, including the ships dog.

The perils of the sea still hard against them, the coxswain and his crew got the lifeboat clear to go to the assistance of the Walmer boat, which was taken in tow. So far leeward had they been blown that the safest option was to make for Ramsgate, which was reached at about noon on the 22nd, where the crew of the ‘Cap Lopez’ and the two lifeboat crews, all thoroughly exhausted, were well cared for at the Sailors Home, with the lifeboats being towed back to their stations by the Harbour tug on the following day.

The men who formed the Kingsdown crew on this occasion were:~
James Pay, (Acting Coxswain), William Sutton, J.Birch, John Bingham, Edward Arnold, A.Sutton, J.Kingsford, T.Bingham, John Arnold, Charles Arnold, W.Laming, James Bingham, and Edward Bingham.

The Walmer crew were:~
T.Heard, H.Parker, R.Mercer, J.Mercer, W.Pearson, H.Pearson, B.Pearson, T.Lewis, G.Norris, W.Baily, J.Bullen, T.Bullen, E.Jordan, B.Jordan, and T.Gardener.

<doc id="737154" wikidata="Q414999" url="?curid=737154" title="Calaverite">
<text>Calaverite, or gold telluride, is an uncommon telluride of gold, a metallic mineral with the chemical formula AuTe2, with approximately 3% of the gold replaced by silver. It was first discovered in Calaveras County, California in 1861, and was named for the county in 1868.

The mineral often has a metallic luster, and its color may range from a silvery white to a brassy yellow. It is closely related to the gold-silver telluride mineral sylvanite, which, however, contains significantly more silver. Another AuTe2 mineral (but with a quite different crystal structure) is krennerite. Calaverite and sylvanite represent the major telluride ores of gold, although such ores are minor sources of gold in general. As a major gold mineral found in Western Australia, calaverite played a major role in the 1890s gold rushes in that area.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Calaverite occurs as monoclinic crystals, which do not possess cleavage planes. It has a specific gravity of 9.35 and a hardness of 2.5.

Calaverite can be dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid. In hot sulfuric acid the mineral dissolves, leaving a spongy mass of gold in a red solution of tellurium.

==Structure==

Calaverite&#x27;s structure has been both an object of fascination and frustration in the scientific community for many years. Goldschmidt &quot;et al.&quot; indexed calaverite 105 crystals resulting in 92 forms but needed five different lattices to index all of the faces. This led to consideration that calaverite violated Haüy&#x27;s Law of Rational Indices.

The introduction of X-ray diffraction did not completely solve this problem. Tunell and Ksanda in 1936 and then Tunell and Pauling in 1952 solved the C2/m general structure of calaverite. However, additional diffraction spots which they could not interpret were present in the survey. Later, transmission electron microscopy study suggested that the satellite reflections in calaverite were due to Au in incommensurately displacive modulation superimposed on the average C2/m structure. In 1988, Schutte and DeBoer solved the structure by using the 3H super space group C2/m (α O γ)Os. They also showed that these modulations consist mainly of the displacements of tellurium atoms and the observed modulations were interpreted in terms of valence fluctuations between the Au+ and Au3+. According to Schutte and DeBoer, those displacements also affect the coordination number of calaverite.

In 2009, Bindi &quot;et al.&quot; concluded that the different coordination numbers associated with calaverite were indeed associated with a significant differentiation in the valence sum of Au, and that the random distribution of Ag suppresses the fluctuation of Au+ and Au3+, whereas the ordered distribution reinforces it.

==Occurrence==

Calaverite occurrences include Cripple Creek, Colorado, Calaveras County, California, US (from where it gets its name), Nagyag, Romania, Kirkland Lake Gold District, Ontario, Rouyn District, Quebec, and Kalgoorlie, Australia.

===History===
Calaverite was first recognized and obtained in 1861 from the Stanislaus Mine, Carson Hill, Angels Camp, in Calaveras Co., California. It was named for the County of origin by chemist and mineralogist Frederick Augustus Genth who differentiated it from the known gold telluride mineral sylvanite, and formally reported it as a new gold mineral in 1868. Genth found that the telluride formula for calaverite generally corresponded with the gold-silver telluride mineral sylvanite, but had a far lower percentage of ionic silver in place of ionic gold (3 to 3.5% in Genth&#x27;s analysis, vs. 11 to 13% silver typical for sylvanite). Since silver is isomorphous with gold in telluride minerals (i.e. gold atoms replace silver without automatically changing the crystal character), Genth more importantly reported the calaverite differed from sylvanite in having no distinct crystalline cleavage line, whereas sylvanite was known to have a distinct line of cleavage. (As discussed above, both sylvanite and calaverite have since been found to be basically monoclinic, whereas the third known gold-silver telluride mineral krennerite is orthorhombic, with yet a different characteristic line of cleavage parallel to the crystal base). Genth was later also able to characterize a sample of calaverite from Boulder, Colorado, finding that his two specimens from that location were 2.04 and 3.03% silver.

In the initial phase of the Kalgoorlie gold rush in Western Australia in 1893, large amounts of calaverite were initially mistaken for fool&#x27;s gold, and were discarded. The mineral deposits were used as a building material, and for the filling of potholes and ruts. Several years later, the nature of the mineral was identified, leading to a second gold rush of 1896 that included excavating the town&#x27;s streets.

<text>In mathematics, the complex projective plane, usually denoted or is the two-dimensional complex projective space. It is a complex manifold of complex dimension 2, described by three complex coordinates

:formula_1

where, however, the triples differing by an overall rescaling are identified:

:formula_2

That is, these are homogeneous coordinates in the traditional sense of projective geometry.

==Topology==
The Betti numbers of the complex projective plane are

:1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, ...

The middle dimension 2 is accounted for by the homology class of the complex projective line, or Riemann sphere, lying in the plane. The nontrivial homotopy groups of the complex projective plane are formula_3. The fundamental group is trivial and all other higher homotopy groups are those of the 5-sphere, i.e. torsion.

==Algebraic geometry==
In birational geometry, a complex rational surface is any algebraic surface birationally equivalent to the complex projective plane. It is known that any non-singular rational variety is obtained from the plane by a sequence of blowing up transformations and their inverses (&#x27;blowing down&#x27;) of curves, which must be of a very particular type. As a special case, a non-singular complex quadric in is obtained from the plane by blowing up two points to curves, and then blowing down the line through these two points; the inverse of this transformation can be seen by taking a point on the quadric , blowing it up, and projecting onto a general plane in by drawing lines through .

The group of birational automorphisms of the complex projective plane is the Cremona group.

==Differential geometry==
As a Riemannian manifold, the complex projective plane is a 4-dimensional manifold whose sectional curvature is quarter-pinched, but not strictly so. That is, it attains &quot;both&quot; bounds and thus evades being a sphere, as the sphere theorem would otherwise require. The rival normalisations are for the curvature to be pinched between 1/4 and 1; alternatively, between 1 and 4. With respect to the former normalisation, the imbedded surface defined by the complex projective line has Gaussian curvature 1. With respect to the latter normalisation, the imbedded real projective plane has Gaussian curvature 1.

An explicit demonstration of the Riemann and Ricci tensors is given in the &quot;n&quot;=2 subsection of the article on the Fubini-Study metric.

<text>Soilwork is a Swedish melodic death metal band from Helsingborg. They have released twelve studio albums. Formed in late 1995 by Björn Strid and Peter Wichers, the band was originally known as &quot;Inferior Breed&quot;. In late 1996, they changed their name to Soilwork, which means &quot;working from the ground up&quot;.


==History==
===Early years (1995–2000)===
The band was formed in late 1995, originally under the name Inferior Breed. Their sound, as explained by &quot;Speed,&quot; was influenced by bands such as Pantera, Meshuggah, and Carcass. Upon changing their band name to Soilwork in late 1996, they began to develop a more melodic sound. Soilwork started work on a demo entitled &quot;In Dreams We Fall into the Eternal Lake&quot;. Before the recording could take place, bassist Carl-Gustav Döös left the group, leaving guitarist Peter Wichers to handle the bass tracks on the demo. In a chance encounter, Soilwork met Michael Amott of Arch Enemy fame, who owned a record store in Helsingborg and was given a copy of their demo. This ultimately led to the band signing with Listenable Records. The band underwent significant changes, which included the arrival of the guitar mastery of David Andersson.

In 1998, Soilwork added keyboardist Carlos Holmberg and bassist Ola Flink. The band recorded and released their debut album, &quot;Steelbath Suicide&quot;, in May of that year. Soon after, guitarist Ludvig Svartz and drummer Jimmy Persson left, citing &quot;different musical opinions&quot;. Persson (now guitar and vocals in Faithful Darkness) was replaced by Henry Ranta, while Svartz was replaced by Peter Wichers&#x27; uncle, Ola Frenning. The band toured throughout Europe in support of the album, sharing the stage with bands such as Darkane, Naglfar, and Krisiun.

In 1999, Soilwork recorded their second full-length album, &quot;The Chainheart Machine&quot;, which was released later that same year. The album received critical acclaim and eventually led to a recording contract with Nuclear Blast, allowing the band to tour with acts such as Defleshed, Cannibal Corpse, and briefly with fellow melodic death metallers Dark Tranquillity.

===Rise to popularity (2000–2006)===
In 2000, after exhausting themselves with touring, Soilwork returned to the studio to record their third full-length album, &quot;A Predator&#x27;s Portrait&quot;. The release was well received and brought Soilwork to the forefront of the melodic death metal scene, alongside label mates In Flames. The band performed at Wacken Open Air that year and toured extensively with Annihilator and Nevermore.

Following up on their success, Soilwork entered the studio again in late 2001 to record the follow-up to &quot;A Predator&#x27;s Portrait&quot; with Devin Townsend and Fredrik Nordström. &quot;Natural Born Chaos&quot; was released in early 2002, to much acclaim as well. Soilwork toured throughout Europe to support the album and, for the first time, throughout the United States—first with bands Hypocrisy, Scar Culture, Chimaira, Unearth, and Killswitch Engage during the summer, and then alongside label mates In Flames during the fall. After touring, they began writing and recording their fifth album.

In December 2002, Soilwork entered the studio to begin recording their fifth album. After recording, the band began a European tour with Children of Bodom and Shadows Fall throughout April and May. That same month, &quot;Figure Number Five&quot; was released. In early June, drummer Henry Ranta left the band to focus more on his personal life and was replaced a week later by Richard Evensand. The band then embarked on another North American tour with In Flames, Chimaira, and Unearth. In September, Soilwork toured Japan with Children of Bodom. Merely days after a short mini-trek through Japan, Soilwork also toured Australia briefly. Later that year, they again toured North America with Chimaira, As I Lay Dying and Bleeding Through. After the tour, Richard Evensand left the band to replace drummer Andols Herrick, who had recently left Chimaira. Soilwork initially announced his temporary replacement as Dirk Verbeuren of Scarve. Verbeuren would later become the full-time replacement. In early 2004, singer Björn &quot;Speed&quot; Strid laid down tracks with Italian melodic death metal band Disarmonia Mundi. During April, the band announced that it had extended its contract with record label Nuclear Blast Records. That same month, the band again toured Australia alongside Anthrax, Embodiment 12:14, and Killswitch Engage. In mid-2004, Soilwork toured Japan for a second time alongside Dark Tranquillity.

Soilwork entered Dug Out Studios on 14 September 2004, to begin recording their sixth full-length album, &quot;Stabbing the Drama&quot;. A week later, the band switched venues and recorded at Fascination Street Studios. &quot;Stabbing the Drama&quot; was released in early March 2005. The album entered the Finnish charts at number 19 and the Swedish charts at number 14. The band also began to experience minor commercial success in the United States. &quot;Stabbing the Drama&quot; reached No. 12 and No. 21 on the Billboard Heatseeker and Independent album charts, respectively. The band participated in the 2005 Ozzfest, performing on the second stage. In November, the band toured the United States with Fear Factory. In late 2005, guitarist Peter Wichers left the band due to tour exhaustion and other personal issues. The same month, Strid announced he was working on a second album with Disarmonia Mundi. In May 2006, Daniel Antonsson was announced as the replacement for Peter Wichers. Soilwork spent the summer appearing at festivals throughout Europe. In September, they toured the UK and Turkey. The band later canceled the Turkish dates due to terrorist attacks and bombings that had recently occurred against tourists there. In October, the band toured North America with Darkest Hour, Mnemic, and Threat Signal.

===Transitional period and continued popularity (2007–2015)===
In early March 2007, Soilwork began recording tracks for their seventh album, &quot;Sworn to a Great Divide&quot;. Late in June, Ola Frenning announced that the album was complete. Soilwork toured in the fall alongside Caliban, Sonic Syndicate, and Dark Tranquillity on the &#x27;Eastpak Antidote&#x27; tour. The album was released on 19 October 2007, through Nuclear Blast. The album featured a sound closer to thrash than their previous works, though still incorporating their signature synth elements. The band also took part in an American tour with co-headliners Lamb of God and Killswitch Engage, as well as DevilDriver. The tour began on 28 November 2007, at the Tsongas Arena in Lowell, Massachusetts, and concluded at the Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, on 17 December 2007. Dubbed The Clash of the Titans Tour 2007, the tour made a stop at the Nokia Live Theatre in Grand Prairie, TX, on 8 December 2007, to perform for the entire Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. On 12 February 2008, an official statement was posted on Soilwork&#x27;s website announcing that Ola Frenning and the band had parted ways. His replacement was Sylvain Coudret. In another statement on 18 September 2008, it was revealed that guitarist Daniel Antonsson would be replaced with the return of former guitarist and founding member Peter Wichers, and that Sylvain Coudret of Scarve, who had been performing session work as the second guitarist during the 2008 Summer festivals, became the band&#x27;s permanent guitarist.

The band returned to the studio in early 2010 to write and record their eighth album, with Strid announcing in a MySpace bulletin on 22 January 2010, that the new album would be titled &quot;The Panic Broadcast&quot;. On 30 June 2010, &quot;The Sledgehammer Files: The Best of Soilwork 1998–2008&quot; greatest hits compilation album was released, followed shortly by the band&#x27;s new album, &quot;The Panic Broadcast,&quot; on 2 July in Europe and 13 July in North America.

On 26 June 2012, Soilwork announced that Peter Wichers had left the band for the second time. Following his departure, Wichers was replaced by David Andersson.

During a 2011 tour, Strid began considering the band&#x27;s next album as a double album. He sought to challenge himself, opting to release a double album rather than a single one after Wichers&#x27; departure. He also aimed to demonstrate that the band could still produce a great album without one of their main composers. By the end of the year, Strid had written two songs and began collaborating with the band in March 2012. Soilwork announced they would begin recording on 23 August 2012.

The album, titled &quot;The Living Infinite&quot;, was released on 27 February 2013, in Asia, 1 March in Europe, 4 March in the UK, and 5 March in North America.

On 24 September 2014, Soilwork released an EP, &quot;Beyond the Infinite&quot;, exclusively in Asia. The EP features 5 unreleased tracks from the band&#x27;s &quot;The Living Infinite&quot; album sessions.

On 5 December 2014, Soilwork frontman Strid confirmed that work had begun on a new album when he posted a picture on Facebook of himself listening to new demos. Strid also stated that Soilwork were sounding &quot;better than ever&quot;. It was also confirmed that Soilwork had teamed up with Testament frontman Chuck Billy&#x27;s Breaking Bands LLC management company for the album.

In June 2015, Soilwork announced that longtime bassist Ola Flink had parted ways with the band and would be replaced by new bassist Markus Wibom.

Soilwork supported Soulfly on their 2015 We Sold Our Souls to Metal Tour. Decapitated and Shattered Sun also joined the tour, which was scheduled for a 27-concert trek beginning on 30 September and concluding in Albuquerque, NM on 30 October. Then, Soilwork went on a European tour as headliners with HateSphere and French band T.A.N.K.

===Departure of Dirk Verbeuren, death of David Andersson and more albums (2016–present)===
On 15 July 2016, it was announced that longtime drummer Dirk Verbeuren had left the band to join Megadeth.

On 19 August 2016, Soilwork released a compilation album, &quot;Death Resonance&quot;, which featured a number of B-sides and rarities from five of their previous albums in addition to two new songs.

On 11 January 2019, Soilwork released &quot;Verkligheten&quot;, their first album with new drummer Bastian Thusgaard, and their first album in nearly four years. On 14 June 2019, the band officially released the &quot;Underworld&quot; EP, which consists of bonus tracks previously available only on physical editions of the band&#x27;s recent &quot;Verkligheten&quot; album.

On 4 December 2020, Soilwork released an EP, &quot;A Whisp of the Atlantic&quot;, which is composed of songs the band recorded and released from late 2019 to mid 2020, along with the ambitious 16-minute title piece that opens the EP.

Soilwork announced in early 2022 that bassist Rasmus Ehrnborn had officially joined the band and contributed to the band&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Övergivenheten&quot;, which was released on 19 August 2022.

On 14 September 2022, it was announced that guitarist and songwriter David Andersson, who had been with the band for 10 years, had died at the age of 47. Touring guitarist Simon Johansson, who had been performing with the band since 2019, was made a permanent member on 13 March 2023.

Soilwork is currently working on a new album, which is expected to be released in 2026.

<doc id="737164" wikidata="Q6489122" url="?curid=737164" title="Large diffeomorphism">
<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, a large diffeomorphism is an equivalence class of diffeomorphisms under the equivalence relation where diffeomorphisms that can be continuously connected to each other are in the same equivalence class.

For example, a two-dimensional real torus has a SL(2,Z) group of large diffeomorphisms by which the one-cycles formula_1 of the torus are transformed into their integer linear combinations. This group of large diffeomorphisms is called the modular group.

More generally, for a surface &quot;S&quot;, the structure of self-homeomorphisms up to homotopy is known as the mapping class group. It is known (for compact, orientable &quot;S&quot;) that this is isomorphic with the automorphism group of the fundamental group of &quot;S&quot;. This is consistent with the genus 1 case, stated above, if one takes into account that then the fundamental group is &quot;Z&quot;2, on which the modular group acts as automorphisms (as a subgroup of index 2 in all automorphisms, since the orientation may also be reverse, by a transformation with determinant −1).

<doc id="737184" wikidata="Q107673" url="?curid=737184" title="87 Sylvia">
<text>87 Sylvia is one of the largest asteroids (approximately tied for 7th place, to within measurement uncertainties). It is the parent body of the Sylvia family and member of Cybele group located beyond the main asteroid belt (see minor-planet groups). Sylvia was the first asteroid known to possess more than one moon.

==Discovery and naming==
Sylvia was discovered by N. R. Pogson on 16 May 1866, from Madras (Chennai), India. Antonio Paluzie-Borrell, writing in Paul Herget&#x27;s &quot;The Names of the Minor Planets&quot; (1955), mistakenly states that the name honors Sylvie Petiaux-Hugo Flammarion, the first wife of astronomer Camille Flammarion. In fact, in the article announcing the discovery of the asteroid, Pogson explained that he selected the name in reference to Rhea Silvia, mother of Romulus and Remus (&quot;MNRAS&quot;, 1866).

==Physical characteristics==
Sylvia is very dark in color and probably has a primitive composition, though with some internal differentiation. The discovery of its moons made possible an accurate measurement of the asteroid&#x27;s mass, density and mass distribution. Its density is low (around 1.4 times the density of water), indicating that the asteroid is porous; best-fit models estimate it had an original composition by volume of 35% rock, 13% ice and 52% internal voids, and that today it consists of a pristine anhydrous outer layer, and a differentiated interior, with meltwater having percolated inward so that the porosity of the rock is filled with ice out to a radius of about 46 km, then ice-free porous rock out to about 104 km.

Sylvia is a fairly fast rotator, turning about its axis every 5.2 hours, giving it an equatorial rotation velocity of about 65 m/s, almost half the escape velocity.

Sylvia&#x27;s shape is flattened and elongated (a/b ≈ 1.45 ; a/c ≈ 1.84) and somewhat irregular. However, its surface has not been imaged well enough for individual features to be resolved.

==Satellite system==

Sylvia has two orbiting satellites. They have been named (87) Sylvia I Romulus and (87) Sylvia II Remus, after Romulus and Remus, the children of the mythological Rhea Silvia.

Romulus, the first moon, was discovered on 18 February 2001, from the Keck II telescope by Michael E. Brown and Jean-Luc Margot. Remus, the second moon, was discovered over three years later on 9 August 2004, by Franck Marchis of UC Berkeley, and Pascal Descamps, Daniel Hestroffer, and Jérôme Berthier of the Observatoire de Paris, France.

The orbital properties of the satellites are listed in this table. The orbital planes of both satellites and the equatorial plane of the primary asteroid are all well-aligned. Diameters are estimates based on the assumption that the moons have the same albedo as their primary.

<doc id="737185" wikidata="Q414266" url="?curid=737185" title="Sylvanite">
<text>Sylvanite or silver gold telluride, chemical formula , is the most common telluride of gold.

==Properties==
The gold:silver ratio varies from 3:1 to 1:1. It is a metallic mineral with a color that ranges from a steely gray to almost white. It is closely related to calaverite, which is more purely gold telluride with 3% silver. Sylvanite crystallizes in the monoclinic 2/m system. Crystals are rare and it is usually bladed or granular. It is very soft with a hardness of 1.5–2. It has a high relative density of 8–8.2. Sylvanite is photosensitive and can accumulate a dark tarnish if it is exposed to bright light for too long.

==Occurrence==
Sylvanite is found in Transylvania, from which its name is partially derived. It is also found and mined in Australia in the East Kalgoorlie district. In Canada it is found in the Kirkland Lake Gold District, Ontario and the Rouyn District, Quebec. In the United States it occurs in California and in Colorado where it was mined as part of the Cripple Creek ore deposit. Sylvanite is associated with native gold, quartz, fluorite, rhodochrosite, pyrite, acanthite, nagyagite, calaverite, krennerite, and other rare telluride minerals. It is found most commonly in low temperature hydrothermal vein deposits.

==Use==
Sylvanite represents a minor ore of gold and tellurium. , an obsolete term for tellurium, derived its name from sylvanite.

<text>mt Xinu (from the letters in &quot;Unix™&quot;, reversed) was a software company founded in 1983 that produced two operating systems. Its slogan &quot;We know Unix™ backwards and forwards&quot; is an allusion to the company&#x27;s name and abilities.

mt Xinu offered several products:

* mt Xinu was a commercially licensed version of the BSD Unix operating system for the DEC VAX. The initial version was based on 4.1cBSD; later versions were based on 4.2 and 4.3BSD.
* more/BSD is mt Xinu&#x27;s version of 4.3BSD-Tahoe for VAX and HP 9000, incorporating code from the University of Utah&#x27;s HPBSD. It includes NFS.
* Mach386 is a hybrid of Mach 2.5/2.6 and 4.3BSD-Tahoe/Reno for 386 and 486-based IBM PC compatibles.

mt Xinu produced interoperability software for Macintosh and Unix, including an AppleShare server for Unix.

The company&#x27;s principals were University of California, Berkeley computer science students and graduates, including Bob Kridle, Alan Tobey, Ed Gould, and Vance Vaughan. Debbie Scherrer was a later contributor.

mt Xinu made light-hearted Unix-themed calendars, including:

* &quot;Command of the Month&quot; (1987–1988)
* &quot;Lessons in Art&quot; (1989)
* &quot;Platform of the Year&quot; (1990)

A division of mt Xinu spawned Xinet, which was founded in 1991.

<text>This is a list of current Christian [[Pope (word)|popes]] and [[patriarch]]s who are notable.

==Pope and patriarchs in the Catholic Church==

In 2006, Benedict XVI renounced the title of &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; (&quot;Patriarcha Occidentis&quot;).
In 2024, Pope Francis reinstated the title of &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; (&quot;Patriarcha Occidentis&quot;), reversing the decision by the previous Pope Benedict XVI; the title reinstatement was meant to bring closer ties to the other Patriarchs in the Eastern Orthodox faith.

<doc id="737199" wikidata="Q275826" url="?curid=737199" title="Jane Elliot">
<text>Jane Elliot (born January 17, 1947) is an American actress, best known for her role as Tracy Quartermaine in the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Career==
Elliot appeared in a number of episodic prime time television series, such as &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; and &quot;Police Woman&quot;. She had a lead role in the short-lived NBC series &quot;Rosetti and Ryan&quot; in 1977.

Elliot also made film appearances, including &quot;Change of Habit&quot; (1969); opposite Elvis Presley, Mary Tyler Moore, and Barbara McNair; and &quot;One Is a Lonely Number&quot; (1972). In 1987, Elliot appeared in the films &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Baby Boom&quot;.

=== Daytime roles ===
Elliot made her daytime debut in the short-lived ABC soap &quot;A Flame in the Wind&quot; in 1965. She is best known for her role as Tracy Quartermaine on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Elliot debuted as Tracy in 1978 and became a fan favorite. Her first stint included a scene which underscored Tracy&#x27;s ruthlessness, where Tracy withholds her father&#x27;s heart medication when he appears to be suffering a heart attack. Elliot left in 1980 and won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the role in 1981. The same year, she landed the recurring role of Judy Trent on the prime time CBS series &quot;Knots Landing&quot;.

From 1981 to 1982, Elliot appeared on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Carrie Todd, a character who was involved with Ross Marler; Ross learns that Carrie is a murderer and has a split personality. Elliot considers her time as Carrie as one of her favorite roles, saying &quot;the most was asked of me when I was doing that role.&quot;

From 1984 to 1986 she played Cynthia Chandler Preston Cortlandt on &quot;All My Children&quot;. Cynthia seduced wealthy, older Palmer Cortlandt, broke up Palmer and Daisy&#x27;s marriage and married Palmer, while sleeping with Ross Chandler.

In 1986 producer Gail Kobe contacted Elliot, to offer her the role of Stephanie Douglas Forrester on the newly created CBS soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. Elliot accepted the role, but on Christmas Eve 1986, Kobe called Elliot to tell her that Susan Flannery was returning to daytime as Stephanie, and creator Bill Bell had given Flannery the part instead.

Elliot next appeared on daytime as Anjelica Deveraux on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1987 to 1989. Although married to Harper Deveraux (played by Joseph Campanella), Anjelica has an affair with the much younger Justin Kiriakis (played by Wally Kurth), and becomes pregnant with his child. Complications ensue when Anjelica discovers that Harper is sterile, and has always known about it. Elliot played the part of Anjelica for two years, with the character being involved in many additional complications and intrigues.

After leaving &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, she returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1989, and in 1991 was reunited with Kurth, who was cast as Tracy&#x27;s son, Ned Ashton. Elliot left again in mid-1993, later becoming a producer on the 1995 ABC soap opera &quot;The City&quot;. From 1996 to 1997 she reprised the role of Tracy Quartermaine on &quot;The City&quot; after briefly appearing as Tracy again on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In 2003, Elliot returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as a regular cast member. In 2014, she was nominated for another Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, 33 years after her win and 21 years since her last nomination. Elliot announced her retirement in March 2017.

In November 2019, it was announced that she would be returning to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in December 2019.
She has made several short-term appearances since; the character of Tracy&#x27;s appearances have primarily been written as holiday visits.

<text>The Palliser expedition, officially the British North American Exploring Expedition, explored and surveyed the open prairies and rugged wilderness of western Canada from 1857 to 1860. The expedition was led by Irish-born explorer John Palliser, and accompanied by a party of four other men: James Hector, Eugène Bourgeau, Thomas Blakiston and John W. Sullivan. With the support of the British government and the Royal Geographical Society it became an official expedition with the stated purpose of gathering scientific information about the landscapes of British-claimed north-western North America (today&#x27;s western Canada), in particular the territory of Rupert&#x27;s Land, including information on the geography, climate, soil, flora and fauna, in order to discover its capabilities for settlement and transportation.

The expedition was the first detailed and scientific survey of the region between Lake Superior and the southern passes of the Rockies in British North America. The expedition provided a better understanding of the remote western frontier and the new observations and knowledge were significant for the expansion into and development of the western prairies by European settlers. The expedition&#x27;s reports impacted changes in the economy, settlement, transportation, Indigenous communities and the campaign for expansionism in Canada.

==Participants==

The party consisted of:
*John Palliser, geographer
* James Hector, geologist, naturalist, and surgeon
* Eugène Bourgeau, botanist
* Thomas Blakiston, magnetic observer
* John W. Sullivan, mathematician and sextant observer
As well, local guides and interpreters traveled with the party and assisted it in its work.

Such was Maskepetoon, later chief of a small Cree band.
&quot;In 1857 he was engaged by John Palliser’s expedition to act as guide from the Qu’Appelle lakes (near Fort Qu’Appelle) to the elbow of the South Saskatchewan River (near Elbow); from the expedition’s members he acquired the name &quot;Nichiwa&quot;, the Cree term for &#x27;friend&#x27;.&quot;

==Background==
===Views of the West===
With little information about the western prairies and the frontiers of European settlement in British North America, the basis of public knowledge prior to the expedition was largely speculation. There were two main views of the west at the time; one view, which had been the dominant perception leading up to 1856, depicted the region as a remote and barren wasteland, an excessively rugged wilderness that had little prospect for economically useful resources or settlement. With the increasing economic changes of the mid-19th century, the region began to be viewed differently, from the dominant landscapes to the growing potential for economic opportunities. This other view was the expansionist view, which became popular in 1856 and 1857 and viewed the uncharted territory in the west as a &quot;promised land&quot; with many possibilities for agricultural prosperity. With the expansionist view and the potential in the land, the western prairies began to also be seen as a place to settle and live as the barren and harsh wilderness was portrayed as a visionary countryside.

One of the earliest visionaries of western Canada was Arthur Dobbs, who saw the agricultural potential and fertile soils in the mid-18th century. Even with little information or supporting evidence regarding the land&#x27;s potential, visions of the west were influential in portraying British North America as an untouched and unsettled wilderness full of opportunity. In the 1850s, the image of the west was influenced largely by the British government.

Thomas Devine created the first map of British North America&#x27;s West in 1857, which showed the territories of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The map described the land and its potential rather than focusing on the physical features of the landscape, and reflected the expansionist views of the west at the time. Expeditions such as Palliser&#x27;s and Henry Youle Hind&#x27;s were direct results of the expansionist campaign. With the increasing frequency of expeditions to the west, exploring the North West became more popular, specifically among young British men interested in experiencing the wilderness before it was taken over by settlers.

==Purpose==
The western prairies had only been known by the few small Indigenous communities that lived there and the few British fur traders and missionaries, who themselves did not know much about the land. Some of the fur traders and explorers who had been through the area had collected and recorded information and maps; however, this information was often private and not easily accessible by the general public. In order to support the expansionists&#x27; claims of the promises that the west held, promising land needed to be found and publicly documented. Palliser and Hind&#x27;s expeditions were results of increasing pressure by the British government to learn more about the west. Both the Canadian and British governments’ interest in the region and some of these possible opportunities of the land were responsible for their investment and involvement in further research and expeditions.

The purpose of the Palliser expedition was to explore three main areas: the land between Lake Superior and the Red River Colony, the land between the Red River Colony and the Rocky Mountains, and the land beyond the Rocky Mountains towards the Pacific Ocean along the continent&#x27;s western coast. The route between Lake Superior and Red River connected trading posts and was used by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company for some travel. The route had been used frequently by the HBC for trading furs by canoe before 1821. While the pass had not been originally part of the expedition, John Ball wanted a neutral perspective of the company&#x27;s route to determine if it could be reliably used by travellers and for transporting goods as a connecting route to Canada. Palliser and his party also examined a route called White Fish River to see where the Kaministikwia River connected to the main river and determine if it could be used for transportation purposes or as another possible pass from Canada to the prairies. Palliser had seen major waterways facilitating transportation in Mississippi and Missouri and saw the potential for connecting the Red River Colony to Canada.

In collecting accurate and detailed information about the land the party was travelling through, they recorded the different landscapes and terrains from bodies of water to forests and mountains.

== Forming the expedition ==
While some explorers had travelled from Red River out west, many followed routes along the Saskatchewan River that had long been used by fur traders. Palliser became aware of the existence of other routes, primarily used by indigenous communities. In 1848, Palliser met James Sinclair, a Métis explorer with the HBC, who told Palliser about another pass which was off the route from the Red River Colony to the Rocky Mountains and along the United States border. In 1856, Palliser&#x27;s interest in the western prairies initiated his plan to explore western Canada along the American border on a formal expedition. His interest in some of these alternative routes became an idea for a project that could be used to survey the land and provide information about the uncharted region. His project was proposed to the Royal Geographical Society, which was involved in coordinating research expeditions and worked with the government to help fund some of them, after he was elected as a member of the society on November 24, 1856. Through the society, the Expedition Committee approved Palliser&#x27;s proposal, but recommended that the expedition include the help of professional scientists who were able to conduct scientific research that could be used to better understand the land, as Palliser himself did not have any formal training. Under the recommendation of John Ball, who was the parliamentary under-secretary of state for the colonies during 1856, the British government provided funding towards the expedition of £5,000. Given the government&#x27;s interest in the same region, they accepted the proposal and provided funding and support for the expedition. The government&#x27;s involvement was a recognition of the desire and need for development and expansion in the west. While the expedition started out, in Palliser&#x27;s vision, as a one-man expedition exploring the west, it quickly became a legitimate, carefully organized and well-funded expedition through connections to influential and authoritative people and organizations.

John Ball helped organize the group of men to accompany Palliser on the expedition. The men that made up the expedition were trained scientists of various fields. James Hector was a geologist, naturalist and physician. Other members of the British party were Eugène Bourgeau, who had made many contributions in botanical work; Thomas Wright Blakiston, a geographer and magnetical observer; and John W. Sullivan, a mathematician and sextant observer, who was also the secretary for the expedition and responsible for astronomical observations.

==Expedition routes==

=== Timeline ===
Palliser, Hector, Bourgeau, and Sullivan sailed for New York on 16 May 1857.

====1857====

In May 1857, Palliser and the group of men began the expedition. They sailed from Sault Ste Marie by steamship across Lake Superior and Lake Huron. They continued by canoes and by June 12 they had almost reached Isle Royale and continued through Thunder Bay, across the Kaministikwia River and into Fort William, the starting point of the routes they had set out to explore; the first stretch of land was between Lake Superior and Red River. The expedition continued with horses and carts, with supplies provided by the HBC. At Red River Palliser employed a number of Métis guides to assist on the trip west. These guides also acted as interpreters, scouts and armed escorts. 

In June 1857, the party explored White Fish River to determine the river connections and potential usage of the waterways along with the help of three local Ojibwas. They travelled from Thunder Bay up the Kaministiquia River, climbed Mountain Portage, stopped at the Priest&#x27;s Portage and crossed nine other portages.

They continued via the Red River and across the prairies. They met Charles W. Iddings, an American surveyor, along the United States border. The expedition continued through Turtle Mountain, Fort Ellice, Roche Percée, along the South Saskatchewan River to Fort Carlton, then along the North Saskatchewan River, where they spent the winter of 1857/1858.

====1858====

In the spring they marched west, and searched for mountain crossings west of modern-day Irricana. Palliser and Sullivan mapped the North Kananaskis Pass and North Kootenay Pass before returning to Fort Edmonton for the winter. Hector crossed the Vermilion Pass and discovered the Kicking Horse Pass. During the winter, Palliser, Captain Arthur Brisco and William Roland Mitchell went south to Rocky Mountain House to meet the Blackfoot and Northern Peigan First Nations.

====1859====

In 1859, the expedition mapped the confluence of the Red Deer River and South Saskatchewan River, as well as the Cypress Hills, before turning again west. Hector crossed the Rockies through the Howse Pass, and tried unsuccessfully to push through to the Pacific Coast. Palliser and Sullivan crossed the mountains through the North Kootenay Pass and continued down the Kootenay River to Fort Colville, which by then was on American soil as a result of the Oregon Treaty of 1846 and placement of the boundary at the 49th parallel.

Sullivan explored the Columbia River and its tributaries as far west as the Okanogan Valley, while Palliser crossed over land to Midway, BC. Unable to find passes to the Pacific north of the 49th parallel, they reunited with Hector in Fort Colvile. From there, they travelled downstream on the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver and the Pacific Coast, then north to Fort Victoria. The expedition returned to the East Coast by ship through San Francisco and Panama (where they had to go overland to reach a ship to travel in the Atlantic), then to Montreal. From there, they finally sailed back to Liverpool.

== Role of science in expansion ==
The science that was used in this expedition in the surveying of the land and information that was gathered was significant in the types of agriculture that could be grown and opportunities for settlement and transportation. The expedition collected and filed astronomical, meteorological, geological and magnetic data, described the fauna and flora of the lands crossed, as well as considerations regarding settlement and transportation. The research conducted on the expeditions by Hind and Palliser began to redefine the landscape of western British North America in its topography and the differences in the atmosphere. The party recorded longitude and latitude points, altitudes, chronometer rates, variations of the compass, collected different types of plants, recorded measures of the rivers, and observed the various geographical terrains and characteristics of the landscapes. The measurements were compared to previous information and recording of the land by other explorers and scientists in recent years. They looked at existing agricultural development in the soil and the kinds of vegetation being grown in some regions.

==Impact ==

=== Expansionist campaign and the economy ===
Two of the main areas that were discovered on the expedition were the stretch of land which is known now as the fertile belt for the prosperous soil between Red River and the Saskatchewan River Valley and the Rockies. The second expanse of land is through the prairies and extends across the American border, and has become known as Palliser&#x27;s triangle. They reported to the government that this region was too arid for subsistence agriculture, a finding that was overruled by later officials. That was much to the detriment of those who tried to farm there, particularly when homesteading was encouraged by government grants of land From surveying the land, large amounts of fertile land were found which contributed to the change from an economy built around fur-trading to agriculture. The knowledge and plans for western British North America became more clear after Palliser and Hind&#x27;s expeditions, with the detailed records and observations they were able to create a more accurate representation and understanding of the west. After three years of publishing details of the expedition, Palliser presented his report to the British Parliament in 1863. A comprehensive map of the surveyed areas was published in 1865. They concluded that transport through American territory was more feasible. While they found several passes suitable for crossing the Rocky Mountains, they were prevented from proceeding to the Pacific by mountains further west. From this better understanding and supported evidence of promising land and opportunities, work on expanding the west, settlement and connecting Canada to the west through additions to transportation. One of the passes that that party explored on their expedition was later used for transportation purposes, as the Canadian Pacific Railway built through part of it. The opportunities that the land provided became a priority. In connecting the west with Canada, by 1870 agriculture was becoming the main focus and resource in the western prairies, though trading fur continued to be part of the economy. Palliser and Hind&#x27;s expeditions and the research they conducted and the information that they contributed led to the western prairies being divided into regions based on the geography, climate, soil and agricultural potential.

=== Settlement and Indigenous communities ===
The transition in the economic sectors from fur trading to agricultural created more development in western Canada, with a growing population of European settlers. The large presence of European settlers in the west made them a large economic power and created conflict with Indigenous communities in the region. The changes in the economy as a result of this expansion were very rapid and had affected the Metis and Indigenous people as they experienced a shift in their economic, political and cultural control over their communities. Within the 1870s, the foundation of the economy in western Canada was broken down with the isolation and separation from the rest of Canada, and systems of power among Indigenous communities. The disappearance of the buffalo led to the Indigenous communities becoming more reliant on European settlers and the government as they lost their main resource of economic dependency and began selling their land and moving on to reserves.

<text>Mobsters is a 1991 American crime drama film directed by Michael Karbelnikoff. It details the creation of The Commission. Set in New York City, taking place from 1917 to 1931, it is a semi-fictitious account of the rise of Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Frank Costello, and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel. The film stars Christian Slater as Luciano, Patrick Dempsey as Lansky, Costas Mandylor as Costello and Richard Grieco as Siegel, with Michael Gambon, Anthony Quinn, Lara Flynn Boyle, and F. Murray Abraham in supporting roles.

==Synopsis==

The film recounts the rise of four Infamous gangsters: Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, and Frank Costello. The four begin as members of youth gangs on the streets of New York, fighting and hustling as they learn the rules of the street and form strong friendships that benefit them as they grow into their teenage years. The beginning of Prohibition provides them with an entry into organized crime, and under the mentorship of seasoned gangsters such as Arnold Rothstein, they build up a lucrative bootlegging empire.

Despite their success, the four come into conflict with the established leaders of the Mafia, who dislike the idea of working with other criminal organizations to maximize profits and compete with each other for power and influence. Believing that the Mafia must restructure itself in order to thrive, Luciano and Lansky recruit Siegel and Costello to eliminate their bosses and assume control, setting up the Commission and dividing the New York underworld between five families.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 9% based on 33 reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &#x27;Despite an abundance of style and some big names, &quot;Mobsters&quot; can&#x27;t escape its empty plotting, numbing violence, and Gangster Movie 101 concepts.&#x27; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Mobsters&quot; resembles a cart-before-the-horse case of putting marketing ahead of film-making, as the seemingly can&#x27;t-miss premise of teen-heartthrob gangsters gets lost in self-important direction, a shoddy script and muddled storytelling.&quot;
According to Roger Ebert, the movie&#x27;s violence and bloodshed are so far over the top that &#x27;they undermine the rest of the film, and approach parody&#x27;; he gave it two and a half out of four stars.

Both Anthony Quinn and Christian Slater were nominated for Razzie Awards as Worst Supporting Actor for their performances, but lost to Dan Aykroyd for &quot;Nothing But Trouble&quot;.

Slater said he was hoping that the film would be like the much more successful &quot;Bugsy&quot;, but this did not happen: &#x27;Our movie ended up in bits and pieces all over the world,&quot; he said. &quot;They had different versions flying to Japan, Europe and every other place. There were extended versions, shortened versions; all kinds of weird versions. In my opinion, audiences never got to see a full film. Somewhere in all that mess, there was a legitimate story. It was there in the script.&#x27;

===Box office===
The film debuted at No. 2 behind &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, but failed to make a profit.

<text>The Seattle metropolitan area is an urban conglomeration in the U.S. state of Washington that comprises Seattle, its surrounding satellites and suburbs. The United States Census Bureau defines the Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA metropolitan statistical area as the three most populous counties in the state: King, Pierce, and Snohomish. Seattle has the 15th largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the United States with a population of 4,018,762 as of the 2020 census, over half of Washington&#x27;s total population.

The area is considered part of the greater Puget Sound region, which largely overlaps with the Seattle Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The Seattle metropolitan area is home to a large tech industry and is the headquarters of several major companies, including Microsoft and Amazon. The area&#x27;s geography is varied and includes the lowlands around Puget Sound and the Cascade Mountains; the highest peak in the metropolitan area is Mount Rainier, which has a summit elevation of and is one of the tallest mountains in the United States.

==Definition==
As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget, the Seattle metropolitan area is officially the Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and consists of:

* Everett metropolitan division
** Snohomish County: north of Seattle
* Seattle–Bellevue–Kent metropolitan division
** King County: Seattle and its immediate vicinity
* Tacoma–Lakewood metropolitan division
** Pierce County: south of Seattle

Based on commuting patterns, the adjacent metropolitan areas of Olympia, Bremerton, and Mount Vernon, along with a few smaller satellite urban areas, are grouped together in a wider labor market region known as the &quot;Seattle–Tacoma&quot; combined statistical area (CSA), which encompasses most of the Puget Sound region. The population of this wider region was 4,953,389 at the 2020 census and estimated to be 4,993,725 in 2023; the Puget Sound region is home to two-thirds of Washington&#x27;s population. The Seattle CSA is the 14th largest in the United States and the 13th largest primary census statistical area in the country. The additional metropolitan and micropolitan areas included are:

* Bremerton–Silverdale–Port Orchard metropolitan area
** Kitsap County: west of Seattle, separated from the city by Puget Sound
* Centralia micropolitan area
** Lewis County: south of Olympia
* Mount Vernon–Anacortes metropolitan area
** Skagit County: north of Everett
* Oak Harbor micropolitan area
** Island County: northwest of Everett, encompassing Whidbey Island and Camano Island in Puget Sound
* Olympia–Lacey–Tumwater metropolitan area
** Thurston County: southwest of Seattle, at the south end of Puget Sound
* Shelton micropolitan area
** Mason County: west of Tacoma and northwest of Olympia

===Establishment and expansion===

The Census Bureau adopted metropolitan districts in the 1910 census to create a standard definition for urban areas with industrial activity around a central city. At the time, Seattle had the 22nd largest metropolitan district population at 239,269 people, a 195.8 percent increase from the population of the equivalent area in the 1900 census. The Seattle metropolitan district was expanded to encompass the entirety of Lake Washington in the 1930 census and also included Edmonds in Snohomish County, Des Moines in southern King County, and portions of eastern Bainbridge Island in Kitsap County. The district covered , of which two-thirds was outside of Seattle proper, and counted a population of 420,663.

The Seattle metropolitan area, successor to the metropolitan district, was expanded in 1949 to encompass all of King County but lose its portions in Kitsap and Snohomish counties. The local chamber of commerce and other leaders had lobbied for a definition that also included all of Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties in a manner similar to the Portland metropolitan area, which had been expanded to cover four counties in Oregon and southwestern Washington. The Bureau of the Budget (now Office of Management and Budget) added Snohomish County to its definition of the Seattle metropolitan area in 1959. The definition had previously only encompassed King County; local leaders had sought to also include Pierce and Kitsap counties in a &quot;Puget Sound metropolitan area&quot;. Snohomish County had protested its inclusion and had sought a separate metropolitan area designation centered on Everett, which did not meet the population threshold of 50,000 residents.

In the 1950 census, a separate metropolitan area for Tacoma was defined that encompassed all of Pierce County. Kitsap County remained part of no metropolitan area despite its connections to both Seattle and Tacoma. The Office of Management and Budget included the area in the Seattle–Tacoma standard consolidated statistical area in 1981; it was replaced in 1983 by the Seattle–Tacoma consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA). The CMSA was expanded to include Bremerton and Olympia after the 1990 census and was the 12th largest in the country at the time. The Office of Management and Budget restructured its classification system in 2003 and created the Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue metropolitan statistical area to cover the tri-county region. A new Seattle–Tacoma–Olympia combined statistical area (CSA) replaced the CMSA and expanded to cover Island and Mason counties. The Mount Vernon–Anacortes metropolitan area was created in 2003 to encompass Skagit County and added to the Seattle CSA in 2006; the CSA was extended further south to Lewis County through the addition of the Centralia micropolitan area in 2013.

==Geography==

The Seattle metropolitan area covers of land and water in Western Washington divided between the three counties; King County is the largest county at over , followed by Snohomish and Pierce counties. The region includes portions of the Cascade Range and several active volcanoes, including Mount Rainier and Glacier Peak, which can generate lahars that reach populated areas. The summit of Mount Rainier is the tallest point in Washington at above mean sea level; it has 26 glaciers that are visible from much of the region&#x27;s lowlands. To the west of the metropolitan area is Puget Sound, which forms the second-largest saltwater estuary in the United States and is part of the Salish Sea.

===Indian reservations===

The Seattle metropolitan area is home to nine federally recognized tribes that belong to the indigenous Coast Salish peoples:

* Muckleshoot Indian Tribe
* Nisqually Indian Tribe
* Port Gamble Band of S&#x27;Klallam Indians
* Puyallup Indian Tribe
* Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe
* Snoqualmie Indian Tribe
* Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians
* Suquamish Indian Tribe
* Tulalip Tribes

The tribes have sovereign governments that have authority over their enrolled members and the Indian reservations that were established in the region. The reservations were created through treaties with the federal government that were not consistently honored and often combined several tribes together; they were also open to settlement by non-Indians.

===Military installations===

The Puget Sound region has approximately U.S. Department of Defense personnel, including active duty members of the military and civilian workers at United States Armed Forces bases. Major facilities in the area include Joint Base Lewis–McChord in Pierce County, the largest military base on the West Coast with over 25,000 active duty soldiers; Naval Station Everett in Snohomish County; and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Island County. The Kitsap Peninsula—part of the Seattle CSA—is home to Naval Base Kitsap, which includes the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton and Naval Submarine Base Bangor, site of the third-largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world with more than 1,100 warheads for submarines.

The region also has several major companies that serve as defense contractors for the U.S. military, comprising most of Washington&#x27;s $6.9 billion awarded in fiscal year 2022. The largest contractors in the Seattle area include Boeing, PacMed, and Microsoft. The Veterans Health Administration has 110,000 enrolled patients in the Puget Sound region, which includes a large population of retirees.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, there were 4,018,762 people in the three counties that form the Seattle metropolitan area, which comprises 52 percent of Washington&#x27;s population. It is the 15th largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States and among the fastest-growing in the country. The overall population density was . The population was 49.9% male and 50.1% female with a median age of 37.2 years old.

The racial makeup of the metropolitan area was 60.1% White, 15.4% Asian, 6.1% Black, 1.1% Native American or Alaska Native, 1.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 11.0% from two or more races, and 5.3% from other races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race formed 11.2% of the population. From 2010 to 2020, the non-Hispanic White population of the Seattle metropolitan area declined from 68 percent to 58 percent—the largest decline in the U.S. The region also has a large Asian American population that was among the fastest-growing in the country between 2010 and 2020.

There were 1,564,432 total households in the metropolitan area at the time of the 2020 census, of which 47.8% included a married couple, 8.1% included an unmarried cohabiting couple, 19.7% had a single male with no spouse or partner, and 24.4% single female with no spouse or partner. Out of all households, 29.8% had people under the age of 18 and 25.3% had people 65 years or older. Approximately 18.3% of household residents were opposite-sex spouses, while 0.3% were same-sex spouses.

According to a 2022 survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 17 percent of adult residents in the Seattle metropolitan area identified as LGBTQ. The region has one of the highest percentages of same-sex couples in the United States at 1.3 percent of households in the metropolitan area.

===Counties===

King County is the largest of the three counties in the metropolitan area with 2,269,675 people in 2020, or 56 percent of the population of the Seattle area.

===Religion===

The Seattle metropolitan area has one of the largest populations of people in the United States who identify as nonreligious. A 2024 Household Pulse Survey from the United States Census Bureau estimated that 64 percent of adults in the area do not attend religious services more than once a year, the highest percentage among large U.S. metropolitan areas. According to the Pew Research Center&#x27;s 2014 U.S. Religious Landscape Study, the Seattle metropolitan area&#x27;s religious affiliation is as follows:

===Income and wealth===

The cost of living in the Seattle area ranks among the highest in the United States among urban areas, particularly for housing, services, and retail goods. In 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that median household income for residents of the Seattle metropolitan area was $101,700, an 8.2 percent increase from 2019. It is the fourth-highest figure for any metropolitan area in the United States, behind San Jose, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the per-capita income of a Seattle metropolitan area resident was $92,113 in 2022; the previous year, the region ranked tenth in the U.S. for per-capita income. 

The area is home to several of the wealthiest people in the United States and the world by net worth. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos both held the title of world&#x27;s richest person, as determined by &quot;Forbes&quot;, while living in the Eastside city of Medina. Another Eastside suburb, Sammamish, has a median household income of $201,370—the second-highest among cities in the United States. According to a 2024 study by Henley &amp; Partners, the city of Seattle has an estimated 54,200 millionaires—ranking seventh in the United States by number of millionaires—and 11 billionaires.

===Housing and homelessness===
The Seattle area has a housing shortage that has contributed to affordability issues in the early 21st century, particularly due to demand outpacing construction of new units. The metropolitan area had the seventh highest number of new units built among large cities in 2016, of which 63 percent were in multifamily buildings. The state legislature passed a new housing law in 2023 that allows for medium-density units in areas of all cities that supersede local zoning regulations; the new law could allow for 75,000 to 150,000 new units in the region, but exempts certain pre-existing homeowner associations and other contract-based communities. , the median price for a single-family home was $722,000 and the median rent for a one-bedroom unit is $1,505 across the metropolitan area. In King County, an estimated 309,000 new units are needed by 2044 to handle anticipated growth. As of the 2020 census, the Seattle metropolitan area had 1,650,246 total housing units, of which 94.8% were occupied. Of the 85,814 vacant units, 41.1% were for rent, 4.4% were rented but not occupied, 10.1% were for sale, 5.1% had been sold but not yet occupied, and 16.9% were designated for seasonal or recreational use.

King County has the third largest population of homeless or unsheltered people in the United States according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The agency&#x27;s January 2023 report, based on the point-in-time count system, estimates 14,149 people in the county have experienced homelessness; the King County Regional Homelessness Authority adopted a different methodology based on the number of people seeking services and estimated that 53,532 people in the county had been homeless at some point in 2022. According to a survey collected by service providers for the county government, 68.5 percent of respondents said they last had stable housing in King County and 10.8 percent had lived elsewhere in the state. Approximately 57 percent of the homeless population counted by HUD in King County was classified as unsheltered, either living in vehicles, encampments in public spaces, or other places. The number of unsheltered individuals increased significantly in the late 2010s, leading to clearing of encampments and other structures by local governments.

The county has 5,115 emergency shelter beds and tiny house villages, of which 67 percent are in the city of Seattle. Additional shelters, parking lots, and encampment sites are operated by charity organizations and churches in the area; during severe weather events such as heat waves and cold snaps, local governments open additional shelter spaces, but these often reach capacity. In 2021, a total of $123 million was spent on homelessness services by local governments in King County, including cities and the regional authority. The regional authority&#x27;s five-year plan, released in 2023, estimates that $8 billion in capital costs would be required to build and staff 18,205 new units of temporary and transitional housing to address the homelessness crisis.

The January 2023 point-in-time survey conducted in Pierce County identified 2,148 people who were experiencing homelessness, of whom 59 percent were in shelters and 21 percent were unsheltered—either outdoors or in vehicles. The city of Tacoma has 1,225 shelter beds and 137 permanent housing units ; the city government plans to temporarily increase shelter capacity while transitioning to more permanent and long-term housing for homeless people. In Snohomish County, 1,285 homeless individuals in 1,028 households were identified in the January 2023 survey; of them, 594 were in shelters and 691 were unsheltered. Approximately 1,500 students in the Everett School District, the county&#x27;s largest school system, were identified as homeless in 2022. The county has 683 year-round shelter beds and increases capacity during inclement weather; the county government purchased two former motels in 2022 to provide an additional 130 rooms.

==Economy==
The region had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $566.74 billion in 2023, the tenth-highest in the United States and fastest-growing among large cities. The Seattle area also had a GDP per capita of $128,316 in 2022, the third-highest figure among large metropolitan areas in the United States, behind San Jose and San Francisco. , the largest employment sector is professional and business services, with approximately 388,700 employees, followed by trade, transportation, and utilities (361,100), education and health services (317,200), and government (279,300). A total of 2.13 million jobs are available in non-farm sectors in the Seattle metropolitan area; the unemployment rate was 4.4% in October 2024 and 4.2% in October 2023. The average weekly wage was $2,188 across the metropolitan area in early 2024, compared to $1,527 nationally. The region has some of the highest hourly minimum wages in the United States that exceed the state&#x27;s minimum of $16.66; , the minimum wage is $20.24 in Everett for large employers, $20.76 in Seattle, and $21.10 in Tukwila.

Seattle is noted for its technology industry, which developed in the late 20th century and grew significantly with the development of Microsoft and Amazon. The industry has 290,000 workers based in the Seattle area, ranking second nationally behind the San Francisco Bay Area, and comprises 13 percent of the regional workforce; from 2005 to 2017, Seattle was one of five metropolitan areas that had 90 percent of the new technology jobs created in the United States. Amazon is the largest private employer in the region, having grown from fewer than 5,000 local employees in 2009 to approximately 60,000 in 2020; Microsoft, the second-largest tech employer in the region with 57,000 employees , has several subsidiary video game studios in the region. The Eastside is also home to game developers and distributors Valve, Bungie, and Nintendo of America. Since the late 2000s, the area has also become home to satellite offices for Silicon Valley companies such as Google, Meta, and Salesforce. Seattle has historically had few venture capital firms to invest in startups until the 2010s with the advent of new companies founded by alumni of older tech companies in the area; in the early 2020s, several Seattle-area startups were labeled unicorns with a valuation of at least $1 billion.

The region also has a large aerospace industry that is dominated by Boeing, historically the largest employer in Washington state with 60,244 workers . The company has major commercial jetliner assembly plants in Everett and Renton alongside testing facilities in Seattle and smaller component manufacturers in other areas. The Boeing Everett Factory is the world&#x27;s largest building by volume and is the assembly site of the 747, 767 and 777 programs, including their variants, alongside most 787s. The company was headquartered in Seattle until its move to Chicago in 2001; in subsequent years, widebody production of the 787 was moved to Charleston, South Carolina. The Seattle region is also home to several startup electric aircraft and component manufacturers, including Eviation and MagniX, who emerged in the 2010s. The decade also saw the establishment of several space technology companies in the area, including Kent-based Blue Origin, Vulcan Aerospace, Kuiper Systems, and satellite offices for SpaceX; the industry has 13,000 jobs in the Puget Sound region , a two-fold increase since 2018.

The region is a major hub for international trade and handles most of Washington&#x27;s exports, which totaled $78 billion in 2018, through three major seaports on Puget Sound. The Northwest Seaport Alliance was formed in 2015 to enable cooperation between the Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma, rival public ports situated apart. The two ports combine to form the seventh-largest container port in the United States and has the second-largest concentration of warehouse space on the West Coast. The independent Port of Everett is a smaller port but handles exports of a similar value to Seattle and Tacoma due to its proximity to the Boeing Everett Factory. Other maritime industries in the area include shipbuilding and commercial fishing, particularly boat fleets based in Seattle that travel annually to the northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea near Alaska.

The city has a major coffee retail industry that developed in the 1970s and 1980s and spawned several chains that remain headquartered in Seattle, including Starbucks and Tully&#x27;s Coffee. Seattle had the third-most coffee shops per capita in 2019 among U.S. cities, including independent shops and other roasters. The city proper serves as the headquarters for other major companies in various industries, including online travel agency Expedia and wood producer Weyerhaeuser. National retailers REI and Nordstrom were also founded in Seattle and remain headquartered in the area. Bellevue is home to the head offices of truck manufacturer Paccar, telecom network T-Mobile US, and clothing retailer Eddie Bauer. Warehouse retailer Costco is headquartered in Issaquah and has more than a dozen locations in the Seattle area. The region has several large shopping centers that range from traditional enclosed malls like Alderwood Mall and Westfield Southcenter to newer outdoor designs such as University Village. While suburban areas have had few retail vacancies since the COVID-19 pandemic, Downtown Seattle has had a slower recovery with a vacancy rate of nearly 14 percent as of late 2023. In the retail grocery sector, the most popular supermarket chains in the region are owned by Kroger (Fred Meyer and QFC) and the Albertsons Companies (Albertsons, Safeway), alongside warehouse retailers like Costco.

===Tourism===
The Seattle area is a tourist destination, especially during the summer months, for domestic and international visitors. The metropolitan area&#x27;s tourism industry employed 209,000 residents in early 2020, later reduced to 181,000 by 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, an estimated 33.9 million visitors in Seattle and King County spent $7.4 billion; the region had reached a peak of 41.9 million visitors in 2019. Pike Place Market in Downtown Seattle, a large public market with more than 220 shops and restaurants, draws 10 million annual visitors and is among the most-visited tourist attractions in the world. Other major attractions in Seattle include the Space Needle, the Seattle Center Monorail, Seattle Great Wheel, the Amazon Spheres, the Seattle Underground Tour, and the historic Pioneer Square neighborhood. The city is also home to three cruise ship terminals operated by the Port of Seattle that serve excursions through the Inside Passage to Alaska. An estimated 1.8 million passengers visited Seattle on 291 departures during the 2023 summer season with an estimated economic impact of $900 million.

The region has several convention centers that are able to host large events, such as trade shows, fan conventions, corporate meetings, and conferences. The first portion of the Seattle Convention Center (formerly the Washington State Convention Center) was built over Interstate 5 and opened in 1988; it expanded to a second building in 2023 to meet growing demand for event space in Downtown Seattle. The convention center can hold simultaneous events and has over of exhibition and meeting space. Its largest annual events include PAX West (formerly the Penny Arcade Expo), Emerald City Comic Con, Sakura-Con, and the Northwest Flower and Garden Show, which each attract over 10,000 attendees. Smaller convention centers in the area include the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, the Lynnwood Event Center, and the Greater Tacoma Convention and Trade Center.

The areas outside of Seattle proper attract fewer tourists and draw largely from local and regional visitors. In Snohomish County, a majority of visitors in 2019 were from Western Washington and included a large number from within the metropolitan area. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the county&#x27;s largest tourist attraction was the Future of Flight Aviation Center adjacent to Paine Field, which offered tours of the nearby Boeing Everett Factory and drew 300,000 annual visitors. Pierce County had 8.8 million visitors in 2021 and estimated that they spent a total of $1.4 billion. Mount Rainier National Park, located mostly in the county, had 2.3 million visitors in 2022—primarily between July and September.

==Government and politics==

The Seattle MSA comprises three counties, nine federally recognized tribes, and 77 municipalities classified as cities or towns, each with their own governments. These include 39 municipalities in King County, 23 in Pierce County, and 20 in Snohomish County; several cities also extend beyond the borders of a single county. Approximately 71 percent of Puget Sound region residents live in an incorporated city or town; the rest are in unincorporated areas under the direct jurisdiction of counties, which act as the local government. These developed unincorporated areas generally lie within the urban growth areas for existing cities that could annex them or in county-designated areas that would allow communities to vote for incorporation. The incorporated city and town governments vary between mayor–council and council–manager systems, the latter using a council-appointed city manager to handle administration.

All three counties have a home rule charter and are led by an elected county executive and a county council with members representing geographic districts. The elections for the county executive and council, along with other major offices, are held in even-numbered years for Pierce County and odd-numbered years in King and Snohomish counties. The county governments are responsible for various duties for all residents that are generally delegated to other elected and appointed officials, including the assessor, clerk, coroner and medical examiner, prosecuting attorney, and treasurer. These duties include organization of elections and voter registration, enforcement of land use regulations, management of vital records, property assessment, tax collection, public health, and building inspections. The counties also manage the criminal justice system, including the superior and district courts, public defenders, and jails.

The Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC), the designated metropolitan planning organization for the Seattle MSA and Kitsap County, has voluntary membership from 82 municipalities, four tribes, four public ports, and six public transit operators. It maintains a long-range plan for population growth, economic development, and regional transportation that is overseen by an executive board and general assembly of all members. The organization also distributes state and federal funding for projects within the four-county area. Other inter-county organizations include special districts and regional authorities for conservation, transit, libraries, and firefighting; , there are over 220 special purpose districts in the Seattle metropolitan area. Tax rates are set by local governments and can vary due to contributions to special districts; the combined sales tax ranges from 8.1% in parts of Pierce County to 10.6% in several Snohomish County cities, the highest rate in the state.

The Seattle MSA is part of seven congressional districts (the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th) that each elect a member of the United States House of Representatives. The boundaries are redrawn every 10 years by the state&#x27;s independent redistricting commission based on the results of the decennial census. The 8th district is the only one to span all three counties, taking the rural eastern portions and including areas east of the Cascade Mountains. According to the 2022 Cook Partisan Voting Index, six of the congressional districts lean towards Democratic candidates while the 8th district is even between both major parties. In the state legislature, the metropolitan area is part of 28 districts that each elect two House members to a two-year term and one senator to a four-year term. By the 2021 session, almost all legislative districts in the region were represented solely by Democrats in the Senate and House, with the exception of exurban districts. According to a 2022 marketing survey by Nielsen, the Seattle metropolitan area is tied for the eighth highest percentage of adults who favored the Democratic Party, at nearly 55 percent—an 11-point increase from a similar survey conducted in 2004. The area also decides most statewide elections due to their large population, which has contributed to an unbroken line of Democratic governors since 1984.

==Education==

Public K–12 education is managed by local school districts that are governed by elected boards and overseen by two of the state&#x27;s nine regional educational service districts. The Puget Sound Educational Service District covers 35 school districts and 416,000 students in King and Pierce counties, along with Bainbridge Island in Kitsap County, and includes 40 percent of the state&#x27;s student population. The Northwest Educational Service District encompasses 35 school districts in northwestern Washington, including all 14 in Snohomish County. The public school districts are primarily funded by allocations from the state government and local property tax levies that are approved by voters.

The largest school district in the metropolitan area is Seattle Public Schools, which has 51,000 students enrolled for the 2023–24 school year, a 9 percent decrease from its 2019 peak of 56,000 students. The district has 106 schools and over 6,000 staff members; most students attend their closest neighborhood schools, while option schools are able to enroll students from across the city. Other large districts with more than 20,000 enrolled students include Lake Washington, Tacoma, Kent, Northshore, Puyallup, and Federal Way. According to the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, the top high schools in the metropolitan area are primarily in the Eastside region, along with specialized industry and technical schools in Tukwila and Lakewood; the highest-ranked school in Washington is the Tesla STEM High School in the Lake Washington School District. The smallest school district in the Seattle area is the Index School District, which has 19 students and no high school.

The Seattle area has hundreds of registered private schools that serve over 50,000 students and offer alternative curriculums or religious education. The largest private schools in the area are Cedar Park Christian School and King&#x27;s Schools, both Christian programs. Since a state referendum in 2012, charter schools have been approved to operate in the area using public funding while remaining privately-run. These non-district schools are also overseen by the educational service district of their respective region; they are also allowed to participate in the same athletics competitions as public schools under the management of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association.

===Higher education===

The Seattle area has several universities and colleges that provide post-secondary education and are run by public or private institutions. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 45 percent of people in the Seattle–Tacoma–Olympia combined statistical area in 2019 had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher—the tenth-highest rate in the United States. This includes a high number of out-of-state adults who reside in the metropolitan area; according to a 2015 Brookings Institution study, 48% of out-of-state adults had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher compared to 35% of in-state adults.

The oldest and largest public university in the state is University of Washington (UW), which was founded in 1861 and has over 60,000 total students in nearly 500 programs at its three campuses. The main campus in Seattle was established in 1895 after moving from Downtown Seattle; it was joined in 1990 by branch institutions in Bothell and Tacoma that later built permanent campuses in the late 1990s and early 2000s. UW is also a major research university with an annual budget of $10.4 billion and one of the largest employers in the metropolitan area. The state&#x27;s second-largest institution, Washington State University, has an Everett branch campus that was established in 2011 after plans for a UW branch campus were shelved amid the Great Recession.

The area has 17 community colleges and technical colleges that offer two-year degrees and other programs, including transfers to local four-year universities. Each college is assigned a specific district that also conforms to county boundaries. , the largest community college in the state is Bellevue College, which has nearly 9,000 full-time students; other colleges with more than 5,000 enrolled students include Pierce College, Green River College, and Highline College. The three community colleges in Seattle proper form the Seattle Colleges District, which has over 12,000 total students . The area also has several private four-year and two-year institutions that focus on religious or liberal arts programs. These include Seattle University, Seattle Pacific University, Pacific Lutheran University, and University of Puget Sound.

==Media==
The Seattle–Tacoma Designated Market Area, as defined by Nielsen Media Research, includes most of Western Washington and the Wenatchee metropolitan area. , it is the 12th largest television market and 11th largest radio market in the United States by population. King County has the majority of the region&#x27;s television and radio antenna towers, which are concentrated on Seattle&#x27;s hills or on Cougar Mountain and Tiger Mountain in the Issaquah Alps. In addition to over-the-air television, the region is also served by cable and satellite providers, the largest of which is Comcast Xfinity and Wave Broadband.

All major national television networks have affiliates in the region who also produce local news broadcasts and other programming; these include KOMO 4 (ABC), KING 5 (NBC), KIRO 7 (CBS), and KCPQ 13 (Fox). The Seattle area has two non-profit stations that are members of PBS, the U.S. national public broadcaster: KCTS in Seattle and KBTC in Tacoma. The region&#x27;s largest Spanish-language television station, KUNS, lost its Univision affiliation in 2023 and was replaced by Bellingham-based KVOS, which did not produce local news content. National news television network MSNBC was launched jointly by Microsoft and NBC in 1996; its online news operations were based in Redmond until 2012.

The largest radio stations in the Seattle area by listenership are primarily music stations, including several owned by national network iHeart Radio, and talk stations with local ownership. The first radio broadcasters in Seattle emerged in 1922, including the still-operating KJR, and grew through the decade; several radio broadcasters later established their own television stations following the first local broadcast in Seattle by KING predecessor KRSC-TV in 1948. Among the most popular modern stations is KEXP-FM, a non-profit music station that has a worldwide following due to its early use of internet broadcasting. The Seattle area has two NPR-affiliated public radio stations: KUOW-FM, founded at the University of Washington in 1952; and KNKX-FM, founded at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma as KPLU. An attempted takeover of KPLU by KUOW in 2016 resulted in public outcry and the establishment of KNKX under independent ownership.

The region has three major newspapers based in the largest cities of each county: &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, the most-circulated newspaper in the Pacific Northwest, is a daily newspaper based in Seattle and had over 75,000 subscribers in 2022; &quot;The News Tribune&quot; in Tacoma has approximately 54,000 subscribers and switched to a three-day publication schedule in 2024; and &quot;The Daily Herald&quot; in Everett has 33,500 subscribers and prints six editions a week. Seattle&#x27;s oldest daily newspaper, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, ceased print publication in 2009 and became an online-only outlet. The Seattle area also has weekly newspapers in smaller cities, including several owned by Sound Publishing or independent companies; other hyperlocal publications, primarily in Seattle neighborhoods, have largely ceased publication in the early 21st century.

Other newspapers include free weeklies &quot;The Stranger&quot; and &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;, which both ceased regular print publication by 2020; trade and industry publications &quot;Puget Sound Business Journal&quot; and &quot;Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce&quot;; and student newspaper &quot;The Daily of the University of Washington&quot;. The region also has publications in English and other languages for ethnic communities. These include Asian-American publications &quot;International Examiner&quot;, &quot;Northwest Asian Weekly&quot;, and the &quot;Seattle Chinese Post&quot;; and the &quot;Seattle Medium&quot; and &quot;The Facts&quot;, both catered towards the Black community. &quot;Real Change&quot;, a weekly street newspaper, has been published since 1994 and is sold by homeless and low-income vendors with an estimated annual circulation of 550,000 copies. Several digital-only publications emerged in the 2000s and 2010s to provide local news, including &quot;Crosscut.com&quot;, tech industry publication &quot;GeekWire&quot;, and hyperlocal outlets Capitol Hill Seattle Blog and West Seattle Blog.

===Libraries===

The Seattle metropolitan area has several local public library systems that are funded primarily by property taxes that are set by voter-approved levies within a designated library district. These include library districts that cover most of a county—either through direct annexation or contracted by local governments—or a department of the city government. Some cities have opted out of having library systems after voters rejected the proposed property tax to fund services. The earliest public libraries in the region were established in the late 19th century by private organizations that were later absorbed into city governments; the first was in Steilacoom in 1858 and was followed by a Seattle organization in 1868. Several city libraries and local branches were constructed across the metropolitan area with grants from industrialist Andrew Carnegie beginning in 1901. In addition to public libraries, the region also has informal public bookcases (part of the Little Free Library movement) and neighborhood tool libraries that lend tools and materials.

The King County Library System is the largest library in the region, with 50 branches and a total circulation of nearly 18.9 million physical and digital items . It was established as a rural library district in 1943 and absorbed most of the city-operated systems in King County, with the exception of the Seattle Public Library, by 2012. The independent Seattle system has 27 locations, including its Central Library in Downtown Seattle, and had a 2022 circulation of 11 million items. The Sno-Isle Libraries system serves most of Snohomish and Island counties and has 23 locations that circulated 7.4 million items in 2022; Sno-Isle does not serve the city of Everett, which operates the two locations of the Everett Public Library. Pierce County has a county library system with 20 locations that circulated 4.8 million items in 2022 and separate, city-run libraries in Tacoma with eight locations and Puyallup with one location. In 2016, the King County, Sno-Isle, and Seattle systems were among the three largest libraries in the United States by circulation. The King County and Seattle systems were also among the heaviest users of digital lending platform OverDrive by circulation worldwide in 2023, each with more than 5 million checkouts.

==Healthcare==
The metropolitan area has 23 hospitals that provide emergency or specialized medical care and are operated by public authorities or private organizations. Non-profit Catholic organization Providence Health &amp; Services and its subsidiary Swedish Health Services are the largest operator of regional hospitals with seven facilities and over 2,100 combined licensed beds in King and Snohomish counties. The UW Medicine system, managed by the University of Washington, comprises several of the largest hospitals in Seattle and a regional network of clinics. Among them is Harborview Medical Center on First Hill, a 413-bed public hospital and the only Level I trauma center in the state. Other major healthcare systems in the Seattle area include EvergreenHealth, MultiCare, Overlake Hospital Medical Center, and Virginia Mason Franciscan Health.

The Seattle area also has specialized medical facilities that serve the Pacific Northwest or wider regions of the United States. Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital is a major pediatric hospital that serves Washington and four other states; the area has several hospitals for military members and veterans in the area, including the Madigan Army Medical Center on Joint Base Lewis–McChord and the Department of Veterans Affairs&#x27; Puget Sound Health Care System. The largest psychiatric hospital in the region is Western State Hospital in Lakewood, which has a capacity of 800 residents; the three-county region has a total of 64 beds at government facilities and is also home to several private behavioral health centers run by Universal Health Services.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that about 5.7 percent of annual spending for residents in the Seattle metropolitan area was on healthcare. According to a 2022 estimate by the United States Census Bureau, approximately 5.3 percent of people in the Seattle metropolitan area lack health insurance. , the largest insurer in the region is Mountlake Terrace-based Premera Blue Cross, followed by Cambia Health Solutions and Kaiser Permanente. Nearly 900,000 people in the tri-county region are enrolled in Washington Apple Health, a no-cost health insurance program managed by the state government under the federal Medicaid system. An additional 533,000 people in the area were enrolled in Medicare in 2018.

The region has several local health departments that set and enforce public health regulations and perform other duties to prevent the spread of disease: Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County, the Snohomish County Health Department, and Tacoma–Pierce County Health Department are dedicated departments within their respective county governments. In January 2020, the Seattle area detected the first known case of COVID-19 in the United States and within two months had the first deaths from the pandemic in the country; the region&#x27;s relatively low death rate was credited to actions taken by public health authorities and the use of extensive testing and widespread remote work policies before the rest of the country adopted them. Seattle is also home to several major health research institutions, including the Center for Global Infectious Disease Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Gates Foundation, PATH, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

==Transportation==
===Airports===
The largest airport in the region is Seattle–Tacoma International Airport in SeaTac, a major international airport that serves as a commercial hub for Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines. It is operated by the Port of Seattle and lies between Seattle and Tacoma; both cities contributed financially to its construction, which was completed in 1944 for military use and later expanded for commercial aviation. Sea-Tac served 46 million passengers in 2023 and was the 11th busiest airport in the United States and 28th busiest in the world by passenger volume. , the airport has 91 domestic destinations and 28 international destinations in North America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.

The area&#x27;s other conventional passenger airport is Paine Field in Everett, north of Downtown Seattle. The airport is owned by the Snohomish County government and primarily used for general aviation and various industries, including the nearby Boeing Everett Factory. The passenger terminal, operated by a private company, opened in 2019 and serves domestic destinations, primarily in the Western United States. , Alaska Airlines is the sole airline at Paine Field and serves up to eleven destinations during peak seasons.

Proposals to build a reliever airport for Sea-Tac were investigated in the 1990s prior to the decision to build a third runway at the airport to handle increased traffic. The state legislature convened a new commission in 2019 to search for a suitable site for a reliever airport, which could include expansion of Paine Field or construction of an outlying airport by 2040. The commission identified four sites in the southern Puget Sound region but was dissolved before a final recommendation due to public opposition to a new airport.

Limited passenger service is also available from Boeing Field in Seattle, which primarily serves cargo and charter traffic. Kenmore Air, a passenger floatplane operator, serves two airports in the area: the Kenmore Air Harbor Seaplane Base on Lake Union in Seattle and Kenmore Air Harbor on Lake Washington in Kenmore. The metropolitan area&#x27;s other general-use airports include Arlington Municipal Airport in northern Snohomish County; Bremerton National Airport in Kitsap County; the privately-owned Harvey Airfield in Snohomish; and Renton Municipal Airport, adjacent to Lake Washington and the Boeing Renton Factory.

===Roads and highways===
The Seattle area has a grid-based road system that originates at designated points in each of the three counties; streets and roads are numbered from this origin point with cardinal directions as prefixes or suffixes. The origin for the King County grid is 1st Avenue and Main Street in Downtown Seattle; from there, numbers increase outward until they reach the county border and reset. The northernmost street in King County is Northeast 205th Street, which runs along the county line and is known as 244th Street Southwest in Snohomish County. Cities are permitted to have separate numbering and naming systems for streets, including retaining older names prior to the harmonization of street numbers following the adoption of a countywide 911 system in the late 20th century.

In addition to streets and roads under the jurisdiction of the local and county governments, the state legislature designates a network of state highways that are maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). These highways are primarily funded by the state government through a fuel tax and annual fees on vehicle registration that are collected by other departments. Several highways connect beyond the Puget Sound region, including crossings of the Cascade Mountains through mountain passes—of which three have winter access during normal weather. Some city streets in the state highway system, such as Aurora Avenue North on State Route 99 (SR 99), have shared jurisdiction or ownership between WSDOT and local governments.

The state highway system comprises undivided highways as well as controlled-access freeways, which include several routes on the national Interstate Highway System that cover a total of in the Seattle metropolitan area. These freeways were built by the state government in the 20th century to conform with standards set by the Federal Highway Administration and are numbered as part of a national scheme. The main West Coast freeway, Interstate 5 (I-5), travels through the region and serves the cities of Tacoma, Seattle, and Everett; its busiest section in Downtown Seattle carried 274,000 vehicles on an average day in 2016, while approximately 2.6 billion person miles were traveled on the corridor between Federal Way and Everett in 2017. The only east–west Interstate in the area is I-90, which connects Seattle to Bellevue, Issaquah, and Eastern Washington via Snoqualmie Pass. I-5 has two auxiliary routes in the region: I-405, which serves the Eastside and functions as a bypass of Seattle; and I-705, a short spur into Downtown Tacoma that opened in 1990.

Other major freeways in the area include SR 16 from Tacoma to the Kitsap Peninsula; SR 18 from Federal Way to Snoqualmie; SR 167 from Puyallup to Renton; SR 509 from SeaTac to Seattle; SR 520 from Seattle to Redmond; SR 522 from Bothell to Monroe; and U.S. Route 2 (US 2) from Everett to Snohomish. Plans for a larger network of freeways and expressways were drawn up in the 1950s and 1960s, but were later cancelled or downsized due to public outcry and budget issues. Among the cancelled projects were the R.H. Thomson Expressway in eastern Seattle, the Bay Freeway in Seattle&#x27;s South Lake Union neighborhood, and an outer bypass of the Eastside unofficially named Interstate 605 that was proposed several times. The highway system includes several of the longest floating bridges in the world due to the depth of local water bodies and their soft silt, which make conventional bridge designs more challenging. Lake Washington has three of the bridges: a pair carries separate directions of I-90, while the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge carries SR 520 and is the world&#x27;s longest floating bridge at . The SR 520 floating bridge is one of two toll bridges in the area, along with the eastbound span of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge on SR 16, which was constructed with toll revenue. The toll bridges and the State Route 99 tunnel in Seattle use the Good to Go electronic toll system, which charges based on a transponder or by reading a vehicle&#x27;s license plate with fees collected by mail.

The region&#x27;s freeway system includes a network of high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) to encourage use of mass transit and carpools during peak periods; the lanes also include bypasses at ramp meters and special ramps at some interchanges. , of the planned in the network have been constructed and carry 38 percent of all freeway miles traveled. it was the third-largest system of HOV lanes among U.S. metropolitan areas in 2008. A section of HOV lanes on I-405 and SR 167 are planned to be converted to high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes) by the late 2020s. The Good to Go system is used to collect tolls for single-occupant vehicles in the lanes and are set by variable demand with a maximum of $15; vehicles carrying three or more people are exempt from the toll with a compatible transponder.

===Railroads===

The region is served by two Class I railroads primarily used for freight: BNSF Railway, which owns several lines that connect the north–south I-5 corridor and across the Cascade Mountains; and the Union Pacific Railroad, which owns a short section from Tukwila to Tacoma and has operating rights on other BNSF lines. Amtrak operates intercity passenger trains on these railroads with stations in the Seattle metropolitan area. The &quot;Cascades&quot; serves the Portland–Seattle–Vancouver corridor with multiple trips per day; the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; operates daily service to Oregon and California from King Street Station in Seattle; and the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; connects the region to Eastern Washington and Chicago. The &quot;Cascades&quot; travels along the Pacific Northwest Corridor, a designated study corridor for potential high-speed rail service.

===Mass transit===

The Seattle metropolitan area has seven major transit agencies that provide public transportation across several modes, including buses, light rail, commuter rail, and ferries. Most transit modes in the region use the ORCA card, a smart fare card system introduced in 2009. Fares are discounted for people aged 65 or older or those with disabilities; since 2022, all fares for passengers 18 years old and younger have been waived as part of a state program. According to 2019 estimates from the &quot;American Community Survey&quot;, approximately 10.7 percent of workers in the Seattle metropolitan area used public transit to commute—the sixth most per capita among the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The high ridership, particularly for buses in the 2010s, was attributed to subsidized fares and other benefits offered by large employers for commuters.

Sound Transit is a regional authority that manages Link light rail, Sounder commuter rail, and Sound Transit Express buses on freeways. It was created in 1993 and has a district that covers and 2.9 million people across 50 municipalities. Link, the regional rapid transit system, carried 23.9 million passengers in 2022 on its two lines: the 1 Line from Seattle to SeaTac, and the T Line in Tacoma. Sound Transit&#x27;s major capital projects are funded by several sources, including property taxes and fees on motor-vehicle registrations, that are enabled by ballot initiatives approved by voters in 1996, 2008, and 2016. The light rail system plans to expand to by 2045 and cover several major corridors at a total cost of $149 billion. Other local rail systems include the Seattle Streetcar network, which comprises two lines, and the Seattle Center Monorail, a popular tourist attraction that carries 2 million riders annually.

The largest local transit agency is King County Metro, which operates buses, paratransit, vanpools, and rideshare in King County. It also operates an electric trolleybus network in Seattle as well as the city&#x27;s streetcar system. Metro is one of the largest bus agencies in the United States by ridership, carrying 63.6 million annual passengers in 2022. Snohomish County has two transit providers: Community Transit, which serves most of the county and also operates commuter express service to Seattle; and Everett Transit, which serves the city. Other providers include Pierce Transit in Tacoma and Pierce County; Kitsap Transit in Kitsap County; and Intercity Transit in Olympia and Thurston County, which operates fare-free.

===Ferries===

The state-run Washington State Ferries system is the largest maritime transit system in the United States and carries both passengers and vehicles as an extension of the state highway system; it also serves as a tourist attraction in addition to its role as a commuter mode. The ferries carried 17.4 million passengers and 8.6 million vehicles in 2022; prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and service cuts, it had carried 25 million annual passengers. The system was created in 1951 after a state takeover of the Puget Sound Navigation Company&#x27;s main lines in the region. Colman Dock in Downtown Seattle is the system&#x27;s main hub and is served by routes from Bainbridge Island and Bremerton. Vashon Island has two terminals at opposite ends of the island: the north terminal is used by the Southworth–Vashon–Fauntleroy triangle service that connects east to West Seattle; and the south terminal at Tahlequah is part of the Point Defiance–Tahlequah route from Tacoma. Two routes serve Snohomish County: the Edmonds–Kingston run connects to the Kitsap Peninsula and the Mukilteo–Clinton run travels to Whidbey Island. The Pierce County government operates the Steilacoom–Anderson Island ferry with automobile service to two island communities in southern Puget Sound.

The King County Marine Division operates the King County Water Taxi, a passenger ferry service that connects Downtown Seattle to West Seattle and Vashon Island. The Vashon Island run was formerly a passenger ferry operated by Washington State Ferries from 1990 until 2006, when the state government cut its funding; the county government later acquired the service under a new ferry district. The passenger-only Kitsap Fast Ferries system operated by Kitsap Transit connects a terminal near Colman Dock to three terminals on the Kitsap Peninsula. Kitsap Transit launched the system&#x27;s first route, Seattle–Bremerton, in 2017 to provide a faster alternative to the existing state ferry run; it expanded using a fleet of catamarans designed for low wakes. The agency also runs a passenger-only foot ferry between Bremerton and two terminals in Port Orchard using the historic &quot;Carlisle II&quot; and other boats. The Port of Everett runs a seasonal passenger ferry between Everett and Jetty Island in Possession Sound. These services are similar to that of the historic Mosquito Fleet, a collective name for passenger ferries operated on Puget Sound from the 1880s to 1920s.

In addition to public operators, several private ferry and excursion services are based in the Seattle area. The Victoria Clipper connects Downtown Seattle to Victoria, British Columbia, via an international passenger ferry. Argosy Cruises operates sightseeing cruises in Elliott Bay and the Lake Washington Ship Canal; from 2009 to 2021, the company also operated Tillicum Village, a performance and culinary cruise on Blake Island.

==Utilities==

There are six electric utilities that distribute electricity to customers in a local market within the Seattle metropolitan area. They draw most of their electric power from hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest, along with wind, natural gas, and coal. In 2020, these utilities generated or sold over megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, of which 52 percent was from hydroelectric sources. The largest utility, Puget Sound Energy, is a private company that covers most of King County and portions of Pierce County; , it derives half of its electricity from coal and natural gas. The company is one of two non-government providers alongside the Peninsula Light Company, a non-profit cooperative on the Key Peninsula. The remaining local providers, Seattle City Light, the Snohomish County Public Utility District, and Tacoma Power, are public utilities who are also members of the Energy Northwest consortium. They generate their own electricity and also purchase it from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which operates 31 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers. The cost of electricity in the metropolitan area is approximately 25 percent below the average for the United States due to its reliance on hydroelectricity; , the average price of electricity ranged from 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour in Tacoma to 10.2 cents for Puget Sound Energy customers.

The region derives most of its tap water from sources in the Cascade Mountains that are fed by melted snowpack that accumulate during the autumn and winter and fill reservoirs as they melt. The water is collected and treated by three major public utilities that distribute it for consumption: the City of Everett manages the water supply for most of Snohomish County, which is derived from Spada Lake on the Sultan River; Seattle Public Utilities serves 1.3 million people in King County and has two major water sources on the Cedar and Tolt rivers; and Tacoma Public Utilities uses the upper Green River in King County to serve Pierce County and portions of southern King County. The utilities and other providers also rely on groundwater wells that draw from a series of underground aquifers in the region, but their use has diminished since the mid-20th century. The treatment process generally includes the addition of water fluoridation and the use of chlorine as well as ozone or ultraviolet light disinfection.

Wastewater is collected locally and sent through sewers and pump stations to regional treatment facilities to be discharged into local waterways, primarily Puget Sound. The combined sewer system in older areas, including most of Seattle, also carries untreated stormwater that is dumped with wastewater during overflow events; cities and utilities have undertaken projects to build separate stormwater tunnels and holding tanks to address the issue. Solid waste is collected from curbside bins and dumpsters by local governments or contracted out to companies including Waste Management, Allied Waste, Republic Services, and Recology. County and city governments also operate collection and distribution sites to sort waste before it is sent to a regional landfill or by rail to a waste-to-energy plant. The curbside collection service also includes recycling pickup, which Seattle began in 1988, which is sorted and processed locally and overseas. In 2015, it became mandatory for providers to offer curbside collection of food waste for composting in Seattle after the program was expanded from commercial establishments to all households. Various cities in the metropolitan area banned single-use plastic bags and began imposing charges on reusable or paper bags from 2009 onward, ahead of a statewide ban that took effect in 2021.

Residential and commercial central heating systems in the metropolitan area are primarily supplied by electricity or natural gas; some denser neighborhoods in Seattle also use steam district heating. The region historically had the lowest number of households using air conditioning in their homes in the U.S. due to the temperate summer climate. A series of major heat waves in the late 2010s and 2020s contributed to an increase in the number of households with air conditioning from 31 percent to over 53 percent by 2021. Puget Sound Energy provides natural gas to approximately 850,000 residents in the three metropolitan counties but has announced plans to transition to electric heating under new state regulations. Natural gas, primarily sourced from Canada and the Mountain states, and petroleum are transported through a series of pipelines that travel along the Interstate 5 corridor in Western Washington. The region is also served by oil refineries that primarily receive crude oil transported by ship from Alaska and train from North Dakota. The refineries in Western Washington produce gasoline and diesel fuel that is primarily used for transportation; prices for gasoline in the Seattle metropolitan area are among the highest in the United States, averaging 45 cents higher than the national average from 2017 to 2021, due to a more limited wholesale market.

The Seattle metropolitan area has several broadband and fiber-optic internet service providers, including CenturyLink, Charter Spectrum, Comcast Xfinity, Wave Broadband, and Ziply Fiber; approximately 85 percent of households in the metropolitan area had access to broadband internet service in 2014. Comcast Xfinity has the largest market coverage in the area at an estimated 95 percent of households in 2015 and little overlap with competitors. The Seattle area is also served by the three major cellular network companies in the U.S., including Bellevue-based T-Mobile US, and has had 5G coverage since the late 2010s. The region is part of five area codes under the North American Numbering Plan: 206 in Seattle; 253 in Tacoma and the southern Puget Sound region; 360 for most of Western Washington; 425 in the Eastside and southern Snohomish County; and 564 as an overlay for the region introduced in 2017. Area code 206 was originally assigned to all of Western Washington until it was split in the 1990s with the introduction of new local area codes.

<doc id="737240" wikidata="Q258546" url="?curid=737240" title="In Flames">
<text>In Flames is a Swedish heavy metal band, formed by guitarist Jesper Strömblad in Gothenburg in 1990 out of the Swedish death metal scene. Their lineup has changed several times, with vocalist Anders Fridén and guitarist Björn Gelotte being the only consistent members since 1995. Since the departure of Strömblad in 2010, no original members remain with the band. In Flames helped pioneer melodic death metal along with fellow Swedish bands At the Gates and Dark Tranquillity. The band has sold over two million records worldwide.

During the band&#x27;s early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them, including many session musicians. By the release of &quot;Colony&quot; (1999), the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to alternative metal. This decision was criticized by fans of the group&#x27;s heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band&#x27;s mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales.

Since the band&#x27;s inception, In Flames have released fourteen studio albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs, their latest release being their fourteenth studio album &quot;Foregone&quot; in 2023. In Flames has been nominated for ten Swedish Grammis Awards winning seven of them; including “Hard Rock/Metal Album of the Year” category in 2005 for &quot;Soundtrack to Your Escape&quot;, 2007 for &quot;Come Clarity&quot;, 2009 for &quot;A Sense of Purpose&quot;, and most recently in 2024 for Foregone.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Lunar Strain&quot; (1990–1995)===
In Flames was founded in 1990 by Jesper Strömblad as a side project from his then-current death metal band, Ceremonial Oath. His purpose was to write songs with a more melodic musical direction, something which he was not allowed to do in Ceremonial Oath. In 1993, Strömblad decided to quit Ceremonial Oath due to these musical differences and began focusing more on In Flames. That same year, Strömblad recruited Glenn Ljungström on guitar and Johan Larsson on bass guitar to form the first official In Flames line-up.

The trio recorded a demo in August 1993 and sent it to Wrong Again Records. In order to increase their chances of getting signed to the label, the group lied and said they had thirteen songs already recorded, when in fact they only had three. The owner of the label enjoyed the music, and immediately signed them to the label.

After being signed, work on the band&#x27;s debut album began. The album, titled &quot;Lunar Strain&quot;, was recorded in Studio Fredman and released in August 1994. Since the band did not have a vocalist yet, Strömblad asked Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquillity to provide session vocals. Many other session musicians participated in the recording as well, including guitarists Anders Iwers, Karl Näslund, and Oscar Dronjak (the latter of which provided backing vocals), vocalist Jennica Johansson, and violinist Ylva Wåhlstedt.
During 1994, In Flames recorded and self-produced their first EP, &quot;Subterranean&quot;, in Studio Fredman. In Flames still did not have a vocalist yet, so session vocals were provided this time by Henke Forss. In 1994, the band covered the song &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; for the Metallica tribute album &quot;Metal Militia: A Tribute to Metallica&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Subterranean&quot; was released. &quot;Subterranean&quot; garnered much attention and led the band to acquire a record deal with Nuclear Blast.

===&quot;The Jester Race&quot; (1996)===
In 1995, In Flames became tired of using session musicians to record an album or to do live shows, so the trio asked Björn Gelotte to join the band as the full-time drummer, and 6 months later asked Anders Fridén to join the band as the full-time vocalist. That same year, the new line up recorded the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;The Jester Race&quot; (Released in 1996). This album was recorded once again in Studio Fredman, but unlike previous albums, it was co-produced by the studio&#x27;s owner, Fredrik Nordström. Gelotte also provided some lead and acoustic guitars for the album. Afterwards, In Flames toured with Samael, Grip Inc., and Kreator.

===&quot;Whoracle&quot; (1997–1998)===

In 1997, In Flames recorded and released their third studio album, &quot;Whoracle&quot;. This album was recorded once again in Studio Fredman and co-produced by Nordström. Once again Gelotte provided lead and acoustic guitars for the album. Ljungström and Larsson unexpectedly announced that they were leaving In Flames after the album was recorded. Niklas Engelin and Peter Iwers were recruited to fill in the vacant spots on guitar and bass respectively, during a tour with Dimmu Borgir. After the tour both Engelin and Iwers were asked to join the band as permanent members, to which they agreed. With the new line-up, In Flames then proceeded with a European tour and played their first two shows in Japan. However, by the end of that tour in 1998, Engelin quit In Flames, so the band decided to switch Gelotte from his position as drummer to guitarist, and they recruited Daniel Svensson to take over as drummer.

===&quot;Colony&quot; (1999)===
In 1999, the new line-up recorded and released the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Colony&quot;. This album was recorded once again in Studio Fredman and co-produced by Nordström. The second solo on &quot;Coerced Coexistence&quot; was recorded by Kee Marcello. Afterwards, In Flames toured Europe, Japan, and played their first show in the United States during the Milwaukee Metal Fest.

===&quot;Clayman&quot; (2000–2001)===
In 2000, In Flames recorded and released their fifth studio album, &quot;Clayman&quot;. It was recorded in the same studio as their previous releases and again co-produced by Nordström. Afterwards, In Flames toured with Dream Theater, Slipknot, and Testament. In August 2001, In Flames released &quot;The Tokyo Showdown&quot;, a live album recorded during the Japanese tour in November 2000.

===&quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; (2002–2003)===
In 2002, In Flames recorded and released their sixth studio album, &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot;. Unlike all of In Flames&#x27; previous albums, &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; was not recorded in Studio Fredman or produced by Nordström. The album was produced by Daniel Bergstrand and recorded in a house the band rented in Denmark, except for the drums which were recorded at Dug-Out Studio. &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; represented a major stylistic shift for In Flames music, in the addition of clean vocals, catchier choruses and less growling. It was also their first album to have official singles released from it. That year the band toured with Slayer, Soulfly, and Mudvayne.

===&quot;Soundtrack to Your Escape&quot; (2004–2005)===
In 2003, In Flames recorded their seventh studio album, &quot;Soundtrack to Your Escape&quot;, and released it in 2004. Like with &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot;, the majority of the album was recorded in a house that the band rented in Denmark, with the drums recorded in Dug-Out Studio. This album was also produced by Bergstrand. &quot;Soundtrack to Your Escape&quot; increased the band&#x27;s popularity considerably, selling 100,000 copies in the United States and yielding a No. 2 single on the Swedish charts with &quot;The Quiet Place&quot;. Four music videos were filmed: &quot;The Quiet Place&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Shadow&quot;, &quot;F(r)iend&quot; and &quot;A Touch of Red&quot;, all of which were directed by Patric Ullaeus. The ensuing world tour saw the band make their first trip to Australia, where they played to mostly sold-out crowds. Afterward, In Flames toured with Judas Priest, Mötley Crüe, and Motörhead. In Flames was also featured on the main stage at Ozzfest 2005.

===&quot;Come Clarity&quot; (2006–2007)===
In 2005, In Flames recorded and self-produced their eighth studio album, &quot;Come Clarity&quot;, in Dug-Out studio. That same year, In Flames released &quot;Used and Abused: In Live We Trust&quot;, a box set consisting of material filmed and recorded throughout various live performances during 2004. The DVD was filmed, edited and directed by Ullaeus. Also in 2005, In Flames decided to sign with an additional record label, Ferret Music, so future releases could have better distribution in North America. In 2006, &quot;Come Clarity&quot; was released in North America through Ferret Music and elsewhere through Nuclear Blast. It became the band&#x27;s first No. 1 album on the Swedish charts. A bonus DVD of In Flames playing all the songs in a rehearsal studio was also released. Ullaeus directed their music video for &quot;Take This Life&quot;. That same year, In Flames toured with Sepultura, co-headlined a U.S. tour with Lacuna Coil, joined The Unholy Alliance Tour, was one of the headliners on the Sounds of the Underground tour, and played on the main stage at Download Festival. In 2007, the band played in Dubai for the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival. In Flames also played at Bloodstock Open Air festival in August 2007.

===&quot;A Sense of Purpose&quot; (2008–2009)===

In October 2007, In Flames finished recording their ninth studio album in IF Studios, their own studio located in Gothenburg, Sweden (formerly Studio Fredman). During the recording sessions, the band released studio diaries documenting the recording process. On 23 January 2008, the band confirmed that they had recorded a video for the single &quot;The Mirror&#x27;s Truth&quot;, and posted photos from the video on their official Myspace profile. In Flames were featured on the Gigantour 3 North American tour with Megadeth, Children of Bodom, Job for a Cowboy, and High on Fire.

On 4 April 2008, In Flames released their ninth studio album, &quot;A Sense of Purpose&quot;. The first single from the new album was titled &quot;The Mirror&#x27;s Truth&quot; and was released in Europe on 7 March 2008. In June 2008, In Flames performed at Metaltown Festival, Metalcamp, Graspop Metal Meeting, Nova Rock Festival, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, Gigantour and Download Festival. In late August 2008, In Flames filmed a video for the second single, &quot;Alias&quot;, once again directed by Ullaeus. From January 2008 to December 2009 In Flames toured on the A Sense of Purpose Tour.

On 3 February 2009, the band announced that Strömblad would not be participating in the Australia/South America/Japan tour in order to get treatment for his alcohol abuse problems. Engelin was announced as his replacement for the tour. On 18 February, the band announced their United Kingdom and Ireland tour would not go ahead as planned due to Strömblad&#x27;s alcohol rehabilitation and the birth of Iwers&#x27;s child. On 4 March, the band announced that the third single from &quot;A Sense of Purpose&quot; is the track &quot;Delight and Angers&quot;. The video premiered on the band&#x27;s Myspace on 25 March. It was once again directed and produced by Ullaeus. Alex Pardee did the artwork for the song like he did with all of &quot;A Sense of Purpose&quot;.

The band joined with Killswitch Engage, Dead by April, Every Time I Die and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster for the UK leg of the Taste of Chaos 2009 tour in November 2009.

===&quot;Sounds of a Playground Fading&quot; (2010–2012)===
The departure of guitarist and founding member Jesper Strömblad was announced on the band&#x27;s MySpace on 12 February 2010. The parting was on good terms with Strömblad, stating that &quot;I&#x27;m determined to fight and defeat my demons once and for all...&quot;, with the remaining band members backing his decision, though in a more recent declaration Fridén stated that their relationship with Strömblad was not going well. On 28 February 2011, it was announced that Engelin had re-joined the band to take the vacant spot left by Strömblad&#x27;s departure.

In early 2010, In Flames collaborated with Pendulum on their third studio album &quot;Immersion&quot;. The song &quot;Self Versus Self&quot; is one of three collaborations on the album.

On 11 October 2010, In Flames entered IF Studios in Gothenburg to start recording their new album, tentatively titled &quot;Sounds of a Playground Fading&quot;. On 25 January 2011, the band announced that the recording of their new album was finished and that the album was being mixed. The album was recorded with producer Roberto Laghi.

To support the album, In Flames performed at the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, and alongside Megadeth, Trivium, Machine Head, Godsmack, and Disturbed at the Mayhem Festival 2011. They also played at Hellfest Festival 2011, headlining the second main stage, and Nova Rock Festival in Austria.

In March 2011, In Flames signed with Century Media Records. On 6 April 2011, In Flames announced their newest single, &quot;Deliver Us&quot;, was slated for a May release. For part of the European tour, Jonas Ekdahl of DeathDestruction filled in for Svensson on drums, after Svensson&#x27;s decision to remain in Sweden for a time following the birth of his child.

&quot;Sounds of a Playground Fading&quot; was released in Sweden on 15 June 2011, on 17 June 2011 in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Norway, on 20 June 2011 in the UK, Benelux, France, Greece, Denmark and Portugal, on 21 June 2011 in North America, Spain and Italy, on 22 June 2011 in Finland, Hungary and Japan, and on 24 June 2011 in Australia and New Zealand. A video was made for &quot;Deliver Us&quot;. It was filmed in Gothenburg, and was again directed by Ullaeus, who also directed the second video from &quot;Sounds of a Playground Fading&quot;, &quot;Where the Dead Ships Dwell&quot;.

In an interview at Canada&#x27;s Heavy MTL festival on 12 August 2012, frontman Anders Fridén revealed that In Flames will &quot;start thinking about&quot; recording their next studio album in 2013.

===&quot;Siren Charms&quot; (2013–2015)===
In Flames began recording their eleventh studio album in August 2013. On 10 April 2014, the In Flames website appeared to have been hacked. The alleged hacker threatened to leak information the next day. The band posted on its Facebook, saying, &quot;We have encountered some issues regarding our online platforms. We want to assure you that no Jesterhead member information has been compromised, and our team is working on a solution right now. We apologize for the inconvenience.&quot; However, the site was not really hacked. The following day, the band&#x27;s website was updated with a link to the supposed leak. A short video announced that the new album will be titled &quot;Siren Charms&quot;. The album was released on 9 September 2014, via the band&#x27;s new label, Epic Records. &quot;Siren Charms&quot; includes vocals recorded by fans. Following release of the album they started a World tour, set to last throughout 2015. On 12 October 2014 the band officially announced on their Facebook page that they are to release a brand new Live Blu-ray/DVD and CD set based on their show in Gothenburg, which took place in November 2014 and was officially released on 23 September 2016 titled &#x27;Sounds from the Heart of Gothenburg&#x27;. Longtime drummer Daniel Svensson announced his departure from the band to focus on his family life on 7 November 2015.

===&quot;Battles&quot; (2016–2017)===
In early 2016, In Flames began recording a new album in Los Angeles, and finished the recording in April.

On 25 August 2016, In Flames posted a YouTube link to a new song entitled &quot;The End&quot; along with a new profile picture with the In Flames logo accompanied by the word &quot;Battles&quot;. It was later revealed the same day that &quot;Battles&quot; will be the title of their twelfth studio album, and was released worldwide on 11 November 2016 through Nuclear Blast.

On 17 September 2016 the band announced on their Facebook page that Joe Rickard, formerly of American rock band RED, who performed session drums on Battles is now the new permanent drummer, replacing Daniel Svensson.

On 29 November 2016, Peter Iwers announced the tour supporting Battles would be his last with In Flames. This leaves just Anders and Björn as the only members left in the band who have constantly remained in the lineup since the 1990s. Bassist Håkan Skoger, who previously worked with Friden on his side project &#x27;Passenger&#x27;, played live with the band on their first UK tour date in Scotland. The band then recruited bassist Bryce Paul to play bass on their American tour.

In December 2017, In Flames released &#x27;Down, Wicked, and No Good&#x27; EP, which included three covers and a live performance.

On 5 July 2018, it was announced the band recruited Tanner Wayne as the new drummer, replacing Joe Rickard.

=== &quot;I, the Mask&quot; (2018–2021) ===

On 14 December 2018, In Flames announced that their 13th album titled &quot;I, the Mask&quot; would be released on 1 March 2019. As part of this announcement, they released two singles from the upcoming album, &quot;I Am Above&quot; and &quot;(This Is Our) House&quot;. The music video for &quot;I Am Above&quot; features Swedish actor Martin Wallström lyp syncing the entire song in one shot against a black backdrop and does not show any members of the band. The lyric video released for &quot;(This Is Our) House&quot; features live concert footage from the Borgholm Brinner music festival in Sweden. 
The album was produced by Howard Benson, mixed by Chris Lord-Alge, and mastered by Ted Jensen. On 10 January 2019, the lyric video for &quot;I, the Mask&quot;, the title track of the album, was released via the Nuclear Blast Records&#x27; YouTube channel. In Flames was set to open up for Megadeth and Lamb of God with Trivium in the summer of 2020 in North America. The event has since been rescheduled to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to international visa issues caused by the pandemic, In Flames was later forced to withdraw from the tour and were replaced by Hatebreed.

On 28 August 2020, In Flames released a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Clayman&quot;. It features remastered versions of every song as well as re-recorded versions of &quot;Only for the Weak&quot;, &quot;Bullet Ride&quot;, &quot;Pinball Map&quot;, and &quot;Clayman&quot;. In 2021, Stanne, Strömblad, Svensson, Iwers and Engelin announced the formation of the band The Halo Effect; the band consists entirely of ex-members of In Flames.

=== &quot;Foregone&quot; (2022–present) ===
In early 2022, In Flames announced the festival &quot;Dalhalla Brinner&quot;, their own festival taking place in the Dalhalla open air theater; opening for the band were Orbit Culture, Lorna Shore and Tesseract.

On 13 June 2022, In Flames released the song &quot;State of Slow Decay&quot; and announced they were re-signing with Nuclear Blast; the song was noted for having a sound similar to the band&#x27;s earlier melodic death metal works. On 1 August, the band released another single, &quot;The Great Deceiver&quot;. On 15 September 2022, In Flames announced that their 14th studio album, entitled &quot;Foregone&quot;, would be released on 10 February 2023. The same day as the album&#x27;s announcement, a visualizer for the song &quot;Foregone Pt. 1&quot; was released. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Foregone Pt. 2&quot;, was released on 7 November along with a music video. The album&#x27;s fifth single, &quot;Meet Your Maker&quot;, was released on 16 January 2023 along with a music video. On 8 June 2023, the band announced that bassist Bryce Paul departed from the band on good terms and revealed his replacement Liam Wilson of The Dillinger Escape Plan.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
In Flames, along with Dark Tranquillity and At the Gates, pioneered what is now known as melodic death metal. In addition, In Flames has also been described as a precursor of the 2000s metalcore sound, which was, in turn, influenced by melodic death metal. In 2006, In Flames made their own metalcore album &quot;Come Clarity&quot;. The founding members of all three bands all lived in Gothenburg, Sweden and they were all friends who shared the same musical interests. Eventually, the group of friends branched off into three bands with the same musical direction: In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and At the Gates.

Jesper Strömblad formed In Flames to write music that combined the melodic guitar style of Iron Maiden with the brutality of death metal, something which he stated he had never heard any band do. In writing songs, Strömblad also decided to make use of keyboards, something which was (at the time) uncommon in death metal. Ever since In Flames&#x27; debut studio album, &quot;Lunar Strain&quot;, the band has made use of keyboards. However, despite their sometimes heavy use of keyboards in their music, they still refuse to recruit a full-time keyboardist.

In Flames&#x27; musical style is characterized by the constant use of harmonized lead guitar melodies and screaming-style singing along with death growl. In early albums such as &quot;The Jester Race&quot;, In Flames would often employ two harmonized lead guitars playing over a rhythm guitar. However, since the band only has two guitar players, they found it hard to reproduce those songs during live performances and ever since &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; they have focused on writing songs with the intention of playing them live. On the album &quot;Soundtrack to Your Escape&quot;, the band focused on less guitar melodies, giving place for more synths. However, this has not been continued on the later albums.

In Flames&#x27; vocal style is characterized by the use of growled vocals or screamed vocals complemented at times by clean vocals. On more recent albums such as &quot;Come Clarity&quot;, the band makes more prominent use of clean vocals, especially during choruses. In Flames&#x27; lyrics have also varied during their career. In early albums such as &quot;The Jester Race&quot; and &quot;Whoracle&quot;, In Flames&#x27; lyrics focused on astrology, mankind, and other global themes. On later albums such as &quot;Soundtrack to Your Escape&quot; and &quot;Come Clarity&quot;, In Flames&#x27; lyrics focus more on personal issues, thoughts, and other introspective themes.

Since &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; was released in 2002, In Flames&#x27; fan-base has been split because of the gradual change in style towards a more alternative metal sound. The stylistic changes include screamed and clean vocals, as opposed to the death growl on the early records, more prominent rhythm section and less guitar melodies and solos, more obvious use of synthesizers and electronics, and a clear influence from modern American metal, especially in the uplifting chorus melodies. This later style has been mostly described as alternative metal. Since &quot;Siren Charms&quot; and the subsequent studio album &quot;Battles&quot;, they have more extensively used clean vocals as opposed to screams and growls and have played a softer overall sound, putting more emphasis on a melodic alternative metal direction. Very minimal elements of their earlier melodic death metal sound are utilized at this point. However, some very mild elements of this style can still sometimes be heard in their music. Fridén&#x27;s clean singing style has altered drastically as it is now more prominent and he has taken on a higher-pitched vocal range. This change has often received harsh criticism from older fans for greatly abandoning their roots and instead favouring a much more commercial sound and playing a musical style that is completely unrelated to their original sound.

&quot;Foregone&quot; was widely considered to be a return to form by the band, with reviewers arguing it&#x27;s the first album that successfully combined the &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; styles of the band.

===Legacy===
In Flames has influenced many bands. They have been especially influential on metalcore, with bands such as Darkest Hour, As I Lay Dying, Trivium, Avenged Sevenfold, All That Remains and Still Remains naming them as a source of inspiration. They have also influenced a number of subsequent melodic death metal bands, including Insomnium, Omnium Gatherum, and Blood Stain Child.

==Miscellaneous==

===Awards===
In Flames has been awarded four &quot;Grammis&quot; awards (the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards) to date. In 2005, In Flames won their first &quot;Grammis&quot; award in the category of Best Hard Rock/Metal Album for &quot;Soundtrack to Your Escape&quot;. In 2006, In Flames won the Swedish Export Award, their second &quot;Grammis&quot; award. In Flames was the first metal band to ever win that award and the Swedish economy minister at the time, Thomas Östros, was quoted as saying &quot;Thanks to In Flames, Sweden now have a metal band in the absolute world elite.&quot; In 2007, In Flames once again won the category of Best Hard Rock/Metal Album for &quot;Come Clarity&quot;. They have also won the &quot;Best international Band&quot; award from the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards in 2008.

===Jester Head mascot===
When In Flames were recording their second studio album, &quot;The Jester Race&quot;, Anders Fridén and Niklas Sundin came up with an idea to create a symbol/mascot for In Flames. The result was the Jester Head. This symbol made its first appearance in the cover artwork of &quot;The Jester Race&quot;. The Jester Head is also featured in much In Flames&#x27; merchandise and has been featured in banners as part of In Flames&#x27; live set.
Swedish ice hockey goaltender, Robin Lehner, who is also from Gothenburg had the Jester Head painted on several of his protective face masks.

== Band members ==

Initially formed as a side project by Ceremonial Oath guitarist Jesper Strömblad in 1990, the group&#x27;s first full lineup in 1993 also featured guitarist Glenn Ljungström and bassist Johan Larsson. As the band were without an official vocalist, their 1994 debut &quot;Lunar Strain&quot; featured contributions from Dark Tranquillity guitarist Mikael Stanne, as well as several guest musicians. The 1995 EP &quot;Subterranean&quot; featured vocals by Dawn&#x27;s Henke Forss, as well as drums by Daniel Erlandsson of Eucharist and Anders Jivarp of Dark Tranquillity. Around the time of the EP&#x27;s release, Björn Gelotte joined In Flames as the band&#x27;s first official drummer, and a short time later Anders Fridén was brought in from Dark Tranquillity as the group&#x27;s first official vocalist.

The lineup of Strömblad, Ljungström, Larsson, Gelotte and Fridén released &quot;The Jester Race&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Whoracle&quot; in 1997. By the end of the recording for &quot;Whoracle&quot;, however, both Ljungström and Larsson had announced that they were leaving the band. They were replaced for a short tour by Niclas Engelin and Peter Iwers, both of whom were ultimately retained as official members. Engelin only remained until the following year, however, and his role was taken over by Gelotte. The vacated position of drummer was soon filled by Daniel Svensson. The band&#x27;s lineup remained stable for over a decade, releasing several albums.

In February 2010, founding member Strömblad announced that he was leaving In Flames, with the band admitting that &quot;in order to keep a very dear friend this is probably for the best&quot;. He was replaced for tour dates later in the year by a returning Engelin, who was later announced as a full member of the group in March 2011. In late 2015, long-term drummer Svensson also left In Flames, explaining that he wanted to &quot;spend more time with ... [his] wife and three daughters&quot;. Joe Rickard was brought in as Svensson&#x27;s replacement the following year. Iwers also departed a year after Svensson, explaining that he felt it was &quot;the time to move on with other musical and non-musical adventures&quot;. Bryce Paul took over his place for future tour dates. In July 2018, Tanner Wayne replaced Rickard.

In 2018, Engelin went on hiatus, with former Megadeth member Chris Broderick filling for live shows. The status of Engelin&#x27;s belonging of band was unknown, despite Engelin stating that he was still in the band in an August 2020 interview, before refusing to answer the same question in July 2022. Anders confirmed that Chris was &quot;100% officially in the band&quot;, hinting that Engelin left or was fired, before he confirmed Engelin&#x27;s departure in an interview with Metal Hammer UK. On 8 June 2023, Bryce Paul announced his departure from the band. Liam Wilson of The Dillinger Escape Plan replaced him, initially as a live member, before becoming official by May 2024.

<doc id="737249" wikidata="Q89949" url="?curid=737249" title="Josef Pfitzner">
<text>Josef Pfitzner (24 March 1901 – 6 September 1945) was a politician of Nazi Germany and a writer. He held the rank of SA-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; in the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA). Pfitzner was publicly executed in Prague after World War II for speaking in favour of the Nazis, taking part in Nazi organisations, and defrauding Prague city in financial deals with the Germans. 

== Life ==
Pfitzner was born in Petersdorf, Austrian Silesia. He was a German historian and politician and was Professor of medieval and Eastern European history at the German University of Prague. Early on, he was attracted to Nazism and belonged to the branch of Austrian National Socialism. 

He held the rank of SA-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; in the SA. In 1939, he became the German deputy mayor of Prague and held this office until May 1945. Pfitzner was publicly executed in Prague after World War II within three hours of being convicted for speaking in favour of the Nazis, taking part in Nazi organisations, and defrauding Prague city in financial deals with the Germans. He was hanged in public before up to 50,000 spectators. 

== Work ==
Pfitzner took a special interest in the Sudeten German past and published &quot;Volkstumsschutz und Nationale Bewegung&quot;. Pfitzner wrote that the National Socialism of Germany was &quot;the synthesis of the two great dynamic powers of the century, of the socialist and national idea&quot;. This specific brand of German socialism was perfected in the German borderlands of Austria and especially in the Sudetenland before it came to Germany. His views on the essentially German character of Bohemia and Moravia influenced Reinhard Heydrich during his time as Reich Protector; see R. Gerwarth, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Hangman: the life of Heydrich&quot; (2011), p. 266 with n. 220. However, it was Heydrich&#x27;s influence that contained Pfitzner&#x27;s further career; the Protector considered the deputy mayor - a man of words rather than deeds - to be unsuitable for a responsible position in the times of struggle.

<text>The 1999 Atlantic hurricane season was a fairly active season, mostly due to a persistent La Niña that developed in the latter half of 1998. It had five Category 4 hurricanes – the highest number recorded in a single season in the Atlantic basin, previously tied in 1933 and 1961, and later tied in 2005 and 2020. The season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first storm, Arlene, formed on June 11 to the southeast of Bermuda. It meandered slowly for a week and caused no impact on land. Other tropical cyclones that did not affect land were Hurricane Cindy, Tropical Storm Emily, and Tropical Depression Twelve. Localized or otherwise minor damage occurred from Hurricanes Bret, Gert, and Jose, and tropical storms Harvey and Katrina.

The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Floyd, a strong Category 4 hurricane that caused devastating flooding along the East Coast of the United States, especially in North Carolina. Damage from the storm totaled approximately $6.5 billion (1999 USD) and there were at least 77 fatalities, making it the deadliest hurricane in the United States since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Flooding from Floyd in North Carolina followed Hurricane Dennis, a slow and erratic–moving storm that dropped heavy rainfall in the eastern portion of the state. Tropical Depression Eleven in October contributed to extreme flooding in Mexico, which left 636 people dead and caused $491.3 million in damage, though impact could not be distinguished from the storm itself. Hurricane Irene caused extensive flooding in Cuba and Florida, with lesser effects in the Bahamas and North Carolina. Irene was the second–costliest storm of the season, with about $800 million in damage. Hurricane Lenny was an unusual eastward–moving storm in the Caribbean Sea and a strong late–season storm. It caused extensive damage in the Lesser Antilles in the month of November. Collectively, the storms of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season caused at least 123 fatalities and $8.328 billion in losses.

==Seasonal forecasts==
===Pre-season outlooks===

Ahead of and during each hurricane season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&#x27;s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center&#x27;s, William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI. The forecasts include weekly or monthly assessments of the significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.

Gray and his team at CSU issued their initial season outlook on December 4, 1998, predicting fourteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. The three main factors for this above average season forecast cited included a continuation of abnormally warm sea surface temperatures, the probability that La Niña conditions would remain, and that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) winds would be in a westerly phase. Early in 1999, WRC issued its forecast for the season, projecting ten named storms and six hurricanes, but no prediction on the number of major hurricanes. In subsequent outlooks from Gray and his associates in April, June, and August, the predictions were unchanged.

On April 7, CSU noted that the probability of a major hurricane landfall in the United States was 72%, including a 54% chance on the East Coast and a 40% likelihood on the Gulf Coast. In their outlook on May 27, experts at NOAA noted that an above average season was a strong possibility. An addition to a La Niña, vertical wind shear would be decreased across much of the Caribbean Sea and tropical Atlantic Ocean, and a favorable jet pattern for tropical waves to develop into tropical cyclones. On June 1, TSR predicted that there would be 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes.

As stated by NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981–2010 contains roughly 12 tropical storms, 6 hurricanes, 3 major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) Index of 66–103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, of below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.

==Seasonal summary==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1999, and the first tropical cyclone developed on June 11. It was an above–average season in which 16 tropical cyclones formed. Twelve depressions attained tropical storm status, and eight of these became hurricanes. Five hurricanes intensified further into major hurricanes. The season featured a record-tying five Category 4 hurricanes, later tied again in 2005 and 2020. These were Bret, Cindy, Floyd, Gert, and Hurricane Lenny. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Lenny, dissipated on November 23, which was about a week before the official season ending on November 30, 1999.

A persistent La Niña that developed during the previous season was attributed to the above average activity. Between August and October, there was very low wind shear over the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean, attributed to a combination of abnormal upper-level easterly winds and low-level westerly winds. Six hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused at least 123 deaths and approximately $8.19 billion in damage. Hurricane Gert also caused damage and fatalities, despite not making landfall.
Overall, the season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 177. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength.

==Systems==
===Tropical Storm Arlene===

Along a diffuse front, a broad area of low pressure in association with an upper-level low was noted several hundred miles northeast of Puerto Rico on June 8. After the circulation reformed within the area of stronger convection, the NHC estimated that Tropical Depression One developed at 18:00 UTC on June 11 about southeast of Bermuda. Initially, the system resembled a subtropical cyclone, due to its frontal characteristics. The nascent depression drifted northward for 24 hours, and during this time, it strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene at 12:00 UTC on June 12, based on Dvorak satellite classifications. The storm intensified further to its peak intensity at 00:00 UTC on June 13, with estimated maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of , based on ship reports and satellite. Subsequently, weakening due to westerly wind shear, Arlene tracking westward on June 13 and turned northwest the following day. Because the steering current became poorly defined, it drifted starting on June 15, and executed a small cyclonic loop later that day. At 00:00 UTC on June 17, Arlene was downgraded to a tropical depression. Later that day, it passed about east of Bermuda, where gale-force winds and abnormally high tides were observed. The depression weakened further due to decreasing sea surface temperatures and dissipated early on June 18.
===Tropical Depression Two===

A tropical wave crossed the west coast of Africa on June 20. As the wave moved into the western Caribbean Sea on June 30, a broad cyclonic turning was noted. The system moved over the Yucatán Peninsula on July 1, a day before emerging into the Bay of Campeche as a weak low pressure area. Later on July 2, deep convection became more organized while the system was centered over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. By 18:00 UTC, the low developed into Tropical Depression Two. Around 04:00 UTC on July 3, the depression made landfall about south-southeast of Tuxpan, Veracruz, with winds of . Eight hours later, it dissipated over the mountains of Mexico. The depression dropped heavy rain on the area amounting to a maximum of at Tanzabaca, San Luis Potosí. In some areas, up to of precipitation fell in 24 hours.
===Hurricane Bret===
Late on August 18, a tropical wave in the Bay of Campeche spawned Tropical Depression Three. The depression drifted and was initially hampered by wind shear. By late on August 19, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bret amid more favorable atmosphere conditions. Bret then moved generally northward and strengthened into a hurricane early on August 21. Bret strengthened significantly over the next 36 hours, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with a minimum barometric pressure of on August 22. Thereafter, the storm began to weaken while curving west-northwestward. At 00:00 UTC on August 23, Bret made landfall in central Padre Island, Texas, as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of . After moving inland, the storm weakened quickly, falling to tropical depression status on August 24. Early the following day, Bret dissipated near the border of Coahuila and Chihuahua.

Bret was a small tropical cyclone that made landfall in a sparsely–populated region of Texas, resulting in relatively little damage. Heavy rainfall in the area peaked at in Sarita. At least 200 homes and large agricultural fields were flooded in Duval County. Strong winds left approximately 64,000 people without electricity in South Texas. Four people died after a truck and a tractor collided near Laredo due to slick roads. In Mexico, the storm brought flooding to Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas, with an estimated of rain falling in Nuevo Leon. Numerous homes in the affected regions were damaged or destroyed, leaving roughly 150 people homeless. Three people died in Mexico – one was trampled to death during evacuation, another was electrocuted, and the third drowned. Overall, the storm caused $15 million in damage.
===Hurricane Cindy===

On August 18, a tropical wave moved westward off the coast of Africa. With low pressures and gradually organizing convection, Tropical Depression Four developed west of Senegal early on August 19. Initially it failed to intensify due to wind shear, and the center became ill-defined on August 20. After passing south of Cape Verde, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cindy as the convection became concentrated around the center. Due to a strong ridge, Cindy moved westward, before turning northwestward by August 21. Banding features gradually increased as outflow improved, and late on August 21, Cindy became a hurricane. Afterward, increased wind shear dislocated the convection from the center, which weakened Cindy to a tropical storm.

By August 23, high wind shear remained, and the storm&#x27;s winds decreased to . The shear decreased on August 24, and the convection increased over the center. By late on August 25, Cindy regained hurricane status. A ragged eye appeared on satellite imagery on August 27, and early the next day it attained major hurricane status. Cindy turned north-northwestward, now showing a well-defined eye, and reached Category 4 intensity with winds of on August 28. Turning northward, the storm remained at peak intensity until August 30, when prominent wind shear weakened Cindy again. On August 31, Cindy was downgraded to a tropical storm, and later that day it merged with a large extratropical storm northwest of the Azores.
===Hurricane Dennis===
Tropical Depression Five developed from a tropical wave about east of the Turks Islands on August 23. On the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Dennis despite unfavorable westerly shear, which became a hurricane by August 26. After striking the Abaco Islands in the Bahama, conditions improved, allowing for Dennis to strengthen into a Category 2 by August 28. Around this time, Dennis began to move parallel to the Southeastern United States. Early on August 30, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . By the following day, steering currents collapsed and the storm interacted with a cold front, causing Dennis to move erratically offshore North Carolina. Wind shear and cold air associated with the front weakened Dennis to a tropical storm on September 1 and removed some of its tropical characteristics. Eventually, warmer ocean temperatures caused some re-strengthening. By September 4, Dennis turned northwestward and made landfall in Cape Lookout, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm. The storm slowly weakened inland, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over western New York on September 7.

In the Bahamas, Dennis produced moderate winds, rain, and storm surge on San Salvador, Crooked Island, Eleuthera, and Abaco Islands, resulting in damage to roofs and coastal properties. Dennis brought waves to the east coast of Florida, causing minor erosion and four drowning deaths. The waves left severe erosion and coastal flooding along the Outer Banks of North Carolina. An deep channel created along Highway 12 isolated three towns on Hatteras Island. In Carteret, Craven, and Dare counties, the storm damaged at least 2,025 homes and businesses to some degree. Heavy rainfall, peaking at at Ocracoke, fell in eastern North Carolina. Although the precipitation was generally beneficial due to drought conditions, it also damaged crops. Two indirect deaths occurred in Richlands during a weather-related car accident. Similar inland flooding occurred in northern and eastern Virginia, with precipitation reaching near Lawrenceville. A tornado in Hampton severely damaged five apartment complexes, three of which were condemned completely, as well an assisted living facility; about 460 people were forced to evacuate from the buildings, and as many as 800 vehicles may have been damaged. Overall damage in North Carolina and Virginia totaled about $157 million. Generally minor flooding occurred in the Mid-Atlantic and New England.
===Tropical Storm Emily===

A tropical wave ahead of Hurricane Cindy exited the west coast of Africa on August 15. Minimal development occurred initially, although the structure gradually organized as it approached the Windward Islands. By 06:00 UTC on August 24, the NHC estimated that a tropical depression developed about east-northeast of Tobago. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Emily six hours later. At 1800 UTC on August 24, Emily attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . The NHC did not initiate advisories until 2100 UTC, when a reconnaissance aircraft observed winds of in association with the small circulation of Emily. The agency initially predicted that the storm would intensify into a hurricane near the Windward Islands. Increased wind shear generated by Hurricane Cindy caused Emily to weaken slightly on August 25. Emily began moving slowly northwestward and progressively became more influenced by Cindy, developing occasional convective bursts. Later on August 26, the movement turned northward, well offshore the Lesser Antilles. Eventually, the storm no longer produced convective bursts, and by 12:00 UTC on August 28, Emily weakened to a tropical depression. Six hours later, the storm was absorbed into Cindy northeast of the Leeward Islands.
===Tropical Depression Seven===

Interaction between a strong monsoon-type flow and a tropical wave in the Bay of Campeche resulted in the development of Tropical Depression Seven on September 5. By 00:00 UTC on September 6, the depression attained maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, the center of circulation of the depression became difficult to locate, but was likely heading north-northwestward. Due to warm ocean temperatures, the SHIPS model predicted further intensification, despite the storm having almost no deep convection and being close to land.

At 12:00 UTC on September 6, the depression made landfall near La Pesca, Tamaulipas, with winds of . The depression quickly weakened inland, and dissipated about twenty-four hours after landfall. Due to forecasts that the depression would strengthen to a tropical storm, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for Tampico to Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The storm caused heavy rainfall in Mexico, with as much as falling in Ciudad Mante in the state of Tamaulipas. In Texas, the depression produced light rainfall, peaking at in Harlingen.
===Hurricane Floyd===

A westward moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression while located about east of the Lesser Antilles on September 7. The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Floyd on the following day. Floyd became a hurricane on September 10, while curving northwestward, before the storm resumed its initial west-northwestward course late on the following day. Significant intensification occurred on September 12 and September 13. At 12:00 UTC on the latter date, Floyd peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Thereafter, the storm began weakening while approaching the Bahamas, decreasing to Category 3 intensity at 06:00 UTC on September 14. Six hours later, Floyd made landfall near Alice Town on Eleuthera with winds of , around the time that the cyclone began moving north-northwestward. Shortly before striking the Abaco Islands at 19:00 UTC, the hurricane re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane. Early on September 15, Floyd weakened to a Category 3 hurricane and passed offshore Florida. Floyd weakened to a Category 2 hurricane late on September 15, while re-curving to the north-northeast. At 16:30 UTC on September 16, Floyd made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina, with winds of . Thereafter, the storm rapidly weakened and was a tropical storm by early on the following day. Floyd moved along the coasts of the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey, before striking Long Island in New York early on September 17. Shortly thereafter, Floyd transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while interacting with a frontal zone over Maine.

In the Bahamas, a combination of strong winds and storm surge destroyed numerous restaurants, hotels, shops, and homes, and left tens of thousands without water, electricity, and food. One death was reported. Although millions of people in Florida evacuated, damage was relatively minor. The outer bands of Floyd produced up to of rain and tropical storm force winds. As a result, hundreds of trees were downed, which damaged at 467 houses, and several hotels and businesses. Impact in Georgia and South Carolina was minor. North Carolina bore the brunt of the storm. Heavy precipitation fell in the eastern portion of the state, peaking at near Southport. Numerous rivers experienced at least 500-year floods, causing extensive flooding. About 7,000 homes were destroyed and an additional 56,000 suffered damage, of which 17,000 houses were left uninhabitable. At the height of the storm, more than 500,000 people lacked electricity. Thirty-five fatalities and about $4 billion in damage occurred in North Carolina.

Flooding in Virginia damaged about 182 businesses and 9,250 houses, and left about of standing water in Franklin. There were three deaths and $101 million in losses. In Maryland, flooding damaged at least 694 homes, impacted numerous bridges and roads, and left over 250,000 residents without power. Similar effects occurred in Delaware, with at least 171 houses damaged and numerous roads being inundated or washed out. In Pennsylvania, flash flooding affected over 10,000 homes and left more than 500,000 people without electricity. Losses reached $60 million and there were 13 deaths in the state. The storm also caused significant impact in New Jersey, where 3,978 homes, 1,358 apartments, and 1,758 businesses were destroyed or suffered major damage. Six deaths occurred in the state. New York, New England, and Atlantic Canada also experienced flooding, but to a much lesser degree. In New York City, Floyd dropped of rainfall at the Central Park observatory, setting a daily record for precipitation on September 16. Overall, Floyd caused about $6.5 billion in damage and 73 fatalities.
===Hurricane Gert===
On September 10, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. Due to the development of a low-level circulation and convective banding, the wave became a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on September 11 to the south of the Cape Verde islands. After increases in intensity, banding features, and outflow improvement, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert on September 12 while moving west-northwestward to the south of a subtropical ridge. Warm ocean temperatures and an anticyclone aloft allowed Gert to reach hurricane intensity by the following day. Early on September 15, Gert attained major hurricane strength. After reaching Category 4 status that day, Gert strengthened further, peaking with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of on September 16. An eyewall replacement cyclone, as well as increasing wind shear and an upper-level trough restricting outflow later on, Gert weakened to a low-end Category 3 on September 18.

Gert re-strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane on September 19. However, dry air and colder sea surface temperatures began causing the storm to weaken, with Gert falling to a Category 3 hurricane on September 20 and a Category 2 hurricane on September 21. That day, the hurricane passed about east of Bermuda. Accelerating northeastward under the influence of an approaching trough, Gert weakened to a tropical storm on September 23 after convection decreased around the center. By 12:00 UTC on September 23, convection diminished enough that the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. About six hours later, the remnants of Gert were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm. For several days, Gert threatened to strike Bermuda, prompting the evacuation of tourists. Although Gert&#x27;s center did not make landfall, it passed a short distance east of the island, producing hurricane-force winds that left 11,000 people without power. High waves swept two people out to sea at Acadia National Park in Maine. Later, strong waves struck Newfoundland and left heavy marine damage, with about $1.9 million in damage done to a wharf along the Avalon Peninsula.
===Tropical Storm Harvey===
A tropical wave that emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 4 reached the Gulf of Mexico by September 18. Following an increase in convection, the system became a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on September 19. The depression initially tracked due northward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey by early on September 20. Harvey gradually intensified further and 24 hours after the upgrade, the storm peaked with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Thereafter, no significant change in intensity occurred before the storm made landfall in Everglades City, Florida, late on September 21. Harvey then accelerated across Florida and by early on September 22, merged with a developing extratropical low while located near Grand Bahama. The remnants reached Atlantic Canada before dissipating on September 24.

In Florida, precipitation peaked at in Naples. As a result, at least 34 houses and businesses were flooded. There were sporadic reports of tropical storm-force winds throughout the state, as well as two tornadoes, neither of which caused left severe impact. Damage estimates in Florida reached about $15 million. Throughout the rest of the United States, impact was limited, confined to light rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Heavy precipitation was reported in Atlantic Canada, with of rain falling in Oxford, Nova Scotia, making Harvey the wettest tropical cyclone or remnants on record in that country. Significant flooding, especially to roads and houses, was reported throughout Atlantic Canada, with damage totaling at least $7.6 million. 
===Tropical Depression Eleven===
Until a westward moving tropical wave reached the western Caribbean Sea on September 30, minimal organization occurred. The system eventually emerged into the Gulf of Mexico and developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on October 4. Weak steering current caused the depression to drift slowly and erratically, with the depression initially heading southward, before curving northwest. A surface trough over the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico prevented significant strengthening. The depression remained below tropical storm intensity, attaining its peak intensity on October 5, with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . While approaching the Gulf Coast of Mexico, the depression was absorbed by the surface trough at 18:00 UTC on October 6.

The depression and its remnants contributed significantly to the October 1999 Mexico floods, bring up to of rain to Jalacingo, Veracruz. Throughout Mexico, 90,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving about 500,000 people homeless. and more than 400 people dead.
Flooding caused thousands of landslides and 39 rivers to overflow, leading to the destruction of bridges, houses, widespread crop fields, schools, and electrical networks. Flooding also extended into Central America in late September through early October, causing $40 million (385 million pesos) in crop damage and 70 deaths. However, impact by the depression itself cannot be distinguished. 
===Tropical Depression Twelve===

On September 30, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa. It slowly began to organize during the next several days and by early on October 6, developed into Tropical Depression Twelve while located about east of Martinique. Due to an anticyclone, conditions appeared favorable for significant strengthening, with the National Hurricane Center predicting the depression to be at least a strong tropical storm by October 9. However, wind shear began undercutting the anticyclone, which prevented any significant intensification. Later on October 6, the low-level circulation became exposed to the west of the deep convection. The depression never re-organized and instead deteriorated in structure due to shearing. Despite a burst in convection on October 8, the depression dissipated at 18:00 UTC while located about east-northeast of Barbuda. 
===Hurricane Irene===
A broad trough of low pressure developed into a tropical depression while south of the Isle of Youth on October 12. It headed north and soon intensified into Tropical Storm Irene. On October 14, the storm passed over the Isle of Youth and western Cuba. While over the Straits of Florida, Irene reached hurricane strength. The next day, it made landfall in Key West, Florida, and again near Cape Sable. Later on October 15, Irene moved back over water near Jupiter as a minimal hurricane. It slowly strengthened as it paralleled the East Coast of the United States. When Irene interacted with a trough from the west, while over the warm Gulf Stream waters, the hurricane rapidly intensified and attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds and a minimum barometric pressure of on October 18. However, after accelerating northeast, Irene weakened over the cooler waters of the North Atlantic. On October 19, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Newfoundland and was absorbed by an extratropical low shortly thereafter.

Irene dropped heavy rainfall throughout its path, especially in Cuba and Florida. Rainfall on Cuba peaked at in Manaca-Iznaga, while the rest of the island reported more than . Flooding resulted from the heavy rains, damaging more than 27,000 homes and causing significant effects to banana plantations and sugar cane fields. Hurricane forces winds were also reported in Havana. Four fatalities were reported. The storm brought flooding to Florida, particularly the southern portion of the state, where of rain fell in Boynton Beach. Hundreds were displaced from their homes and thousands were isolated. Five people died from walking through electrified water after a power line fell, while three others drowned after unintentionally driving their vehicle into a canal. Total damage in Florida was around $800 million. The hurricane left five deaths in the Bahamas, one direct and four indirect. Irene also contributed slightly to ongoing flood problems in North Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd.
===Hurricane Jose===
A tropical wave entered the Atlantic on October 8 and developed into a tropical depression while located east of the Windward Islands on October 17. The depression strengthened and by early on October 18, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Jose. Intensification continued as Jose tracked west-northwestward and Jose reached hurricane status late on October 19. The storm became a Category 2 hurricane, though unfavorable conditions weakened it back. Later on October 21, Jose began moving through the Lesser Antilles as a Category 1 and fell to tropical storm intensity before reentering the Atlantic later that day. While north of Puerto Rico on October 22, Jose re-curved northeastward. The storm eventually began to accelerate and re-strengthen, reaching hurricane status again on October 24. After twelve hours as a hurricane, colder sea surface temperatures weakened Jose to a tropical storm on October 25, shortly before it became extratropical.

The worst of the effects from Jose occurred in Antigua and Barbuda, as winds up to were reported. About 500 houses and a newly built church were destroyed. About 50% of residents were left without water and 90% of people experienced power outages. Overall, twelve people were injured, one fatality occurred, and an elderly blind man was listed as missing. Flooding in Saint Kitts and Nevis washed out several major roads and caused landslides. Additionally, one person was killed during the storm. In Sint Maarten, mudslides and flooding damaged houses and roads, especially those in low-lying areas. Nearly of rain and winds up to in Anguilla left roads impassable and power outages, and damaged houses, crops, and shipping facilities. Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands caused extensive power outages and minor damage, estimated at $40,000. Overall, losses from the storm was less than $5 million.
===Tropical Storm Katrina===
A broad area of low pressure associated with remnants of a cold front developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 28. Twenty-four hours later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Katrina. The storm made near landfall Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, on October 30. Later that day, Katrina weakened back to a tropical depression. It continued northwestward across Nicaragua and Honduras, before reemerging into the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Honduras on October 31. However, Katrina did not re-intensify and moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula later that day. While approaching the Gulf of Mexico, Katrina was absorbed by a cold front on November 1.

Katrina dropped heavy rainfall across, which was reported between throughout Nicaragua and Honduras. As a result of the flooding, roughly 1,200 people were evacuated to emergency shelters in Honduras. Flooding also damage five bridges in Honduras, and the cities of Tocoa and Trujillo were isolated as the Aguán and Siline rivers overflowed their banks. Katrina also destroyed water pipes that were replaced shortly after destruction from Hurricane Mitch. Shortly before dissipating, Katrina dropped moderate rainfall across the Yucatán Peninsula and eastern Mexico, peaking at in Cunduacán.
===Hurricane Lenny===
A low pressure area developed into a tropical depression about south of the Cayman Islands at 18:00 UTC on November 13. The depression began to move in an unusual eastward track across the Caribbean Sea along the southern periphery of a trough and strengthened into Tropical Storm Lenny on the following day. It attained hurricane status south of Jamaica on November 15 and passed south of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico over the next few days. Beginning on November 16, Lenny underwent rapid deepening, becoming a major hurricane early on November 17 while south of the Mona Passage. Later that day, Lenny peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of and a minimum pressure of while near Saint Croix. It gradually weakened due to wind shear while moving through the Leeward Islands, where it struck Saint Martin, Anguilla, and Saint Barthélemy. The system weakened to a tropical storm on November 19. After clearing the islands, Lenny deteriorated to a tropical depression on November 21 and dissipated on November 23, while located about east of the Lesser Antilles.

Before moving through the Lesser Antilles, Lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern Colombia. Strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern Puerto Rico. Lenny brought more heavy rains to areas in the Leeward Islands that had been affected by Hurricane Jose just one month earlier, and brought more damage to areas struck by Hurricane Georges in 1998. Despite the hurricane&#x27;s passage near Saint Croix at peak intensity, damage on the small island was only described as &quot;moderate&quot;, although there was widespread flooding and erosion. Damage in the United States territories totaled about $330 million. The highest precipitation total was at the police station on the French side of Saint Martin. On the island, the hurricane killed three people and destroyed more than 200 properties. In nearby Antigua and Barbuda, the hurricane killed one person; torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply. Significant storm damage occurred as far south as Grenada, where high surf isolated towns from the capital city.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1999. This was the same list used for the 1993 season. A storm was named &quot;Lenny&quot; for the first (and only) time in 1999.

===Retirement===

The World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;Floyd&quot; and &quot;Lenny&quot; in the spring of 2000 from the Atlantic hurricane name lists on account of their destructiveness. They were replaced with &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Lee&quot; for the 2005 season.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1999 USD.

<text>The Iroquois Theatre fire was a catastrophic building fire in Chicago, Illinois, that broke out on December 30, 1903, during a performance attended by 1,700 people. The fire caused 602 deaths and 250 non-fatal injuries. It ranks as the worst theater fire in the United States, surpassing the carnage of the Brooklyn Theatre fire of 1876, which claimed at least 278 lives. 

For nearly a century, the Iroquois Theatre fire was the deadliest single-building disaster in American history. Only the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, claimed more lives in a disaster affecting an American building.

Despite being billed as &quot;absolutely fireproof&quot;, the Iroquois Theatre, which opened a month before the fire, exhibited numerous deficiencies in fire readiness that contributed to the high death toll. Some of these deficiencies were known by city officials tasked with public safety. The resulting scandal resulted in changes in building safety codes and code enforcement in the United States and throughout the world. 

The fire broke out at about 3:15 p.m. while the Iroquois presented a matinee performance of the musical &quot;Mr. Blue Beard&quot; starring Eddie Foy. A broken arc lamp ignited some muslin curtains, which stage managers were unable to douse; an attempt to lower the safety curtain to contain the fire was unsuccessful. Despite attempts by Foy to calm the crowd, audience members frantically rushed for the exits, only to find that fire exits were locked or hidden. The largest death toll was at the base of stairways, where hundreds of people were trampled, crushed or asphyxiated; some people jumped to their deaths from the fire escapes. The Iroquois had no fire-alarm box or telephone, which hampered initial rescue efforts. It is estimated that 575 people were killed on the day of the fire, with dozens dying afterward; the vast majority of those killed were audience members.

Two features, the safety curtain and fire dampers, were either not present or not working at the time of the fire. Other contributing factors included a lack of exit signs, emergency lighting, or fire preparedness; doors that opened inward or were locked shut; confusing exit routes; icy or improperly installed fire escapes; and the presence of ornamental doors. The Iroquois Memorial Hospital was built as a memorial to the fire, and Chicago held an annual memorial service. The Iroquois fire prompted widespread implementation of the panic bar, asbestos fire curtains, and doors that open outward. The theater was rebuilt and operated until 1925, when it was replaced by the Oriental Theatre.

== Theater ==
The Iroquois Theatre was located at 26 West Randolph Street, between State Street and Dearborn Street. The syndicate that bankrolled its construction chose the location specifically to attract women visiting the city on day trips who would be more comfortable attending a theater near the police-patrolled Loop shopping district. The theater opened on November 23, 1903, after numerous delays resulting from labor unrest and, according to one writer, the unexplained inability of architect Benjamin Marshall to complete required drawings on time. Upon opening, the theater was lauded by drama critics; Walter K. Hill wrote in the &quot;New York Clipper&quot; (a predecessor of &quot;Variety&quot;) that the Iroquois was &quot;the most beautiful ... in Chicago, and competent judges state that few theaters in America can rival its architectural perfections ...&quot;

The Iroquois had a capacity of 1,602 with three audience levels. The main floor, known as the orchestra or parquet, had approximately 700 seats on the same level as the foyer and Grand Stair Hall. The second level, the dress circle or (first) balcony, had more than 400 seats. The third level, the gallery, had about 500 seats. There were four boxes on the first level and two on the level above.

The theater had only one entrance. A broad stairway that led from the foyer to the balcony level was also used to reach the stairs to the gallery level. Theater designers claimed that this allowed patrons to &quot;see and be seen&quot; regardless of the price of their seats. However, the common stairway ignored Chicago fire ordinances that required separate stairways and exits for each balcony. The design proved disastrous: people exiting the gallery encountered a crowd leaving the balcony level, and people descending from the upper levels met the orchestra-level patrons in the foyer. The backstage areas were unusually large. Dressing rooms were on five levels, and an elevator was available to transport actors down to the stage level. The fly gallery (where scenery was hung) was also uncommonly large.

After the fire, the Iroquois Theatre was renamed and reopened as the Hyde &amp; Behman&#x27;s Music Hall in September 1904. In October 1905, it was rechristened as the Colonial Theatre. It remained active until the building was demolished in 1925. In 1926, the Oriental Theatre was built on the site. In 2019, the Oriental Theatre was renamed the Nederlander Theatre.

=== Fire readiness deficiencies noted before the fire ===
Despite being billed as &quot;absolutely fireproof&quot; in advertisements and playbills, numerous deficiencies in fire readiness were apparent in the theater building. An editor of &quot;Fireproof Magazine&quot; toured the Iroquois during construction and noted &quot;the absence of an intake, or stage draft shaft; the exposed reinforcement of the (proscenium) arch; the presence of wood trim on everything and the inadequate provision of exits.&quot; 

Chicago Fire Department (CFD) captain Patrick Jennings performed an unofficial tour of the theater days before the official opening and noted that there were no sprinklers, alarms, telephones or water connections. The captain and the theater&#x27;s fireman William Sallers discussed the deficiencies. Sallers did not report the matter directly to fire chief William Musham, concerned that he would be dismissed by the syndicate that owned the theater. When Captain Jennings reported the matter to his commanding officer, battalion chief John J. Hannon, he was told that nothing could be done as the theater already had a fireman.

The onsite firefighting equipment consisted of six Kilfyre fire extinguishers. Kilfyre was a form of dry chemical extinguisher also sold for dousing chimney fires in residential houses. It consisted of a tube of tin filled with about of white powder, mostly sodium bicarbonate. The user was instructed to &quot;forcibly hurl&quot; the contents of the tube at the base of the flames. The fire began high above the stage, so the Kilfyre, when thrown, fell uselessly to the ground.

==Fire==


On Wednesday, December 30, 1903, the Iroquois presented a matinee performance of the popular Drury Lane musical &quot;Mr. Blue Beard&quot;, which had been playing at the theater since opening night. The play, a burlesque of the traditional &quot;Bluebeard&quot; folk tale, featured Dan McAvoy as Bluebeard and Eddie Foy as Sister Anne, a role that showcased his physical-comedy skills. Dancer Bonnie Maginn was also in the cast as Imer Dasher. Attendance since opening night had been disappointing as the result of poor weather, labor unrest and other factors. The December 30 performance drew a much larger sellout audience. Tickets were sold for every seat in the house, plus hundreds more for the standing-room areas at the back of the theater. Many of the estimated 2,100–2,200 patrons attending the matinee were children. The standing-room areas were so crowded that some patrons sat in the aisles, blocking the exits.

At about 3:15 p.m., shortly after the beginning of the second act, eight men and eight women were performing the double-octet musical number &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot;, with the stage illuminated by blue-tinted spotlights to suggest a night scene. Sparks from an arc light ignited a muslin curtain, possibly as the result of an electrical short circuit. Lamp operator William McMullen testified that the lamp was placed too close to the curtain but that stage managers had failed to offer a solution when he had first reported the problem. McMullen clapped at the fire when it started, but the flame quickly raced up the curtain and beyond his reach. Theater fireman William Sallers tried to douse the fire with the Kilfyre canisters, but by that time it had spread to the fly gallery high above the stage where several thousand square feet of highly flammable painted canvas scenery flats were hung. The stage manager tried to lower the asbestos fire curtain, but it snagged. Early reports stated that the asbestos curtain was stopped by the trolley wire that carried acrobats over the stage, but later investigation showed that the curtain had been blocked by a light reflector that protruded from under the proscenium arch. A chemist who later tested part of the curtain stated that it was composed mainly of wood pulp mixed with asbestos and would have been &quot;of no value in a fire.&quot;

Foy, who had been preparing to take the stage, attempted to calm the crowd from the stage, first ensuring that his young son was in the care of a stagehand. He later wrote, &quot;It struck me as I looked out over the crowd during the first act that I had never before seen so many women and children in the audience. Even the gallery was full of mothers and children.&quot; Foy was widely considered a hero after the fire for his courage in remaining on stage and pleading with patrons not to panic even as large chunks of burning scenery landed around him.

By this time, many of the patrons on all levels were attempting to flee the theater. Some had found the fire exits hidden behind draperies on the north side of the building but discovered that they could not open the unfamiliar bascule locks. Bar owner Frank Houseman, a former baseball player with the Chicago Colts, defied an usher who refused to open a door. He was able to open the door because his ice box at home had a similar lock. Houseman credited his friend outfielder Charlie Dexter, who had just quit the Boston Beaneaters, with forcing open another door. A third door was opened either by brute force or by a blast of air, but most of the other doors could not be opened. Some patrons panicked, crushing or trampling others in a desperate attempt to escape. Many were killed while trapped in dead ends or while trying to open windows that appeared to be doors.

The dancers on stage were also forced to flee, along with the performers backstage and in the numerous dressing rooms. Several performers and stagehands escaped through the building&#x27;s main rear exit, which consisted of a large set of stock double doors normally used for moving large fly sceneries and set pieces or props into the backstage area. When the door was opened, an icy wind blast rushed inside, fueling the flames with air and causing the fire to grow substantially larger.

Many performers escaped through the coal hatch and through windows in the dressing rooms, and others tried to escape via the west stage door, which opened inward and became jammed as actors frantically pressed toward the door. A passing railroad agent saw the crowd pressing against the door and unfastened the hinges from the outside, allowing the actors and stagehands to escape. As the vents above the stage were nailed or wired shut, the fireball instead traveled outward, ducking under the stuck asbestos curtain and streaking toward the vents behind the dress circle and gallery away. The hot gases and flames passed over the heads of those in the orchestra seats and incinerated flammable materials in the gallery and dress circle levels, including patrons still trapped in those areas.

Those in the orchestra section exited into the foyer and out of the front door, but those in the dress circle and gallery who escaped the fireball could not reach the foyer because stairwells were blocked by high layers of fallen victims. Although iron grates that blocked secondary stairways during performances (to prevent patrons in the cheaper seats from sneaking downstairs to the more expensive lower levels) were still in place, first responders found very few victims near the gates. The largest death toll was at the base of stairways, where hundreds of people were trampled, crushed or asphyxiated. People who were able to escape using the emergency exits on the north side found themselves on fire escapes, one of which was improperly installed, causing people to trip upon exiting the fire-escape door. Many jumped or fell from the icy, narrow fire escapes to their deaths, and the bodies of the first jumpers broke the falls of those who followed them. Students from the Northwestern University building north of the theater tried bridging the gap with a ladder and then with some boards between the rooftops, saving those few able to manage the makeshift crossover.

The Iroquois had no fire-alarm box or telephone. The CFD&#x27;s Engine 13 was alerted to the fire by a stagehand who had been ordered to run from the burning theater to the nearest firehouse. On the way to the scene, at approximately 3:33 p.m., a member of Engine 13 activated an alarm box to call additional units. Initial efforts focused on the people trapped on the fire escapes. The alley to the north of the theater, known as Couch Place, was icy, narrow and full of smoke. Aerial ladders could not be used in the alley and black nets, concealed by the smoke, proved useless.

The Chicago Police Department became involved when an officer patrolling the theater district saw people emerge from the building in a panic, some with clothing on fire. The officer reported the incident from a police box on Randolph Street, and police, summoned by whistles, soon converged on the scene to control traffic and aid with the evacuation. Some of the city&#x27;s 30 uniformed police matrons were summoned because of the large number of female casualties.

==Victims==
Mass panic ensued and many of those trapped inside tried climbing over piles of bodies in order to escape. Corpses were stacked ten feet high around some of the blocked exits. The victims were asphyxiated by the fire, smoke and gases or were crushed by the onrush of others behind them. It is estimated that 575 people were killed on the day of the fire, and at least 30 more died of injuries over the following weeks. Many of the dead were buried in Montrose, Calvary, Saint Boniface, Mount Greenwood, Mount Hope, Mount Olivet, Oak Woods, Rosehill, Graceland, Forest Home and Waldheim Jewish cemeteries. 

Of the approximately 300 actors, dancers and stagehands, only five people died: aerialist Nellie Reed, an actor in a bit part, an usher and two female attendants. Reed&#x27;s role was to fly as a fairy over the audience on a trolley wire, showering them with pink carnations. She was trapped above the stage while waiting for her entrance and fell during the fire. She died from burns and internal injuries three days later.

==Additional factors reducing survivability==
===Protecting the audience from hazards onstage===
The risks inherent in flammable scenery and props were recognized even in 1903. Two features, a safety curtain that confines fire to the stage area and smoke doors that allow smoke and heat to escape through the roof above the stage, combine to increase fire safety in theaters. This arrangement creates negative pressure; the stage area becomes a chimney, and fresh, breathable air is sucked through the exit doors into the audience area. At the Iroquois, the smoke doors above the stage were fastened closed. This meant that smoke flowed out of the building through many of the same exits through which people were trying to escape.

* Skylights on the roof of the stage, which were intended to open automatically during a fire and allow smoke and heat to escape, were fastened closed.
* The curtain was not tested periodically, and it became stuck when the theater personnel tried to lower it.
* The curtain was not fireproof. Curtains made with asbestos interwoven with wire create a strong and effective barrier against fire. The asbestos curtain at the Iroquois not only failed to lower but also proved to be both weak and flammable. Chemist Gustave J. Johnson of the Western Society of Engineers analyzed a piece of the material after the fire: &quot;[It] was largely wood pulp. By mixing pulp with asbestos fiber, the life of the curtain is prolonged, the cost is cheapened, and the wire foundation may be dispensed with... It results in a curtain that may get inside city ordinances, but is of no value in a fire.&quot; Curtain material was rendered irrelevant by the triangular gap beneath the partly jammed curtain that functioned as a flue for the back-drafted fireball that hurled into the auditorium at 3:50 pm. Eyewitnesses testified that the curtain was still in place when the fireball passed through the gap.

===Emergency evacuation===
The owners of the theater claimed that the 30 exits would allow everyone inside to escape the building within five minutes. Audiences in 1903 were aware of the hazards of fires in theaters, especially after at least 384 people died in the Ringtheater fire in Vienna, Austria.

* Some exit doors opened inward into the auditorium and others employed a bascule-type European latch unfamiliar to many people that prevented the door from opening when the crowd pressed against it. When people were able to pull the doors open enough to escape, some people were then wedged in the door opening as people continued to push on the door. Today, exit doors open outward, so that people trying to escape will tend to hold the doors open.
* There were no exit signs on fire-escape exits, and doors were concealed behind drapery. On the ground floor, the drapery was intact after the fire, but in the balconies, drapery was destroyed by the fireball.
* Theater staff had never experienced a fire drill. They were unfamiliar with the exits and some refused to open locked exit doors.
* The theater had no emergency lighting, and auditorium lights had been dimmed for the moonlight act on the stage at the time when the fire erupted. The electric switch box, located directly between the initiation point of the fire, was soon destroyed, darkening the entire auditorium, with the only illumination coming from the flames on the stage.
* During performances, some lesser-trafficked stairways were blocked with iron gates to prevent people with inexpensive tickets from taking seats in other parts of the theater. On the day of the fire, there were no empty seats. Had such gates been located at primary stairways, the death toll would have been higher; first responders reported that few victims were found at the iron gates.
* Many of the exit routes were confusing.
* There were several ornamental &quot;doors&quot; that looked like exits but were not. Two hundred people died in one passageway that was not an exit.
* Iron fire escapes on the north wall led to at least 125 deaths. People were trapped on all levels because the icy, narrow stairs and ladders were dangerous and because smoke and flames blocked the way down. The stairs on one fire-escape exit from the second-floor gallery had not been adjusted to accommodate a last-minute engineering alteration during construction that raised the level of the gallery floor inside the auditorium. As a result, the fire-escape landing was two feet lower than the theater floor, causing people to stumble and fall onto the landing.

==Aftermath==
In New York on New Year&#x27;s Eve, some theaters eliminated standing room. Building and fire codes were subsequently reformed; theaters were closed for retrofitting all around the country and in some cities in Europe. All theater exits were required to be clearly marked and the doors configured so that, even if they could not be pulled open from the outside, they could be pushed open from the inside.

After the fire, it was alleged that fire inspectors had been bribed with free tickets to overlook code violations. Chicago mayor Carter Harrison IV ordered all theaters in Chicago closed for six weeks after the fire. As a result of public outrage, many were charged with crimes, including Harrison. Most charges were dismissed three years later because of the delaying tactics of the syndicate&#x27;s lawyers and their use of loopholes and inadequacies in the city&#x27;s building and safety ordinances. Levy Mayer was the attorney for the theater and its manager was Will J. Davis.

The exterior of the Iroquois was intact and the theater reopened nine months later as Hyde &amp; Behman&#x27;s Music Hall. The building later reopened as the Colonial Theater, which was demolished in 1925 to make way for the Oriental Theatre, which was later renamed the Nederlander Theatre in 2019.

==Media coverage==
Newspaperman Walter Howey was working for the &quot;Chicago Inter Ocean&quot; newspaper as a reporter when he made his reputation by scooping competitors in reporting the Iroquois Theatre Fire.

Walking the streets of Chicago near the theater, Howey was startled to see a knight and three elves climb out of a manhole. He had stumbled upon four &quot;Mr. Blue Beard&quot; actors fleeing the conflagration. As more people escaped via the theater cellar through the sewers, Howey reported his scoop; the story, one of the biggest in Chicago&#x27;s history, established his reputation for speed, resourcefulness, and skillful writing. Howey moved to William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Chicago American&quot; and went on to become a managing editor of several newspapers in the Hearst chain. He was later immortalized as the scheming, ruthless managing editor Walter Burns in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur&#x27;s play &quot;The Front Page&quot;.

&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; assistant city editor Edgar Sisson situated himself at Dyche&#x27;s Drug Store on Randolph and State near the Iroquois Theatre, directing dozens of &quot;Tribune&quot; reporters, some of whom removed bodies from the theater. &quot;Tribune&quot; reporter E.O. Phillips lost three nieces to the fire.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; printed an eight-page special edition that hit newsstands on the morning of December 31, 1903. The entire front page consisted of lists of the dead and missing. Twenty &quot;Tribune&quot; employees had been assigned the job of obtaining photographs of the victims, and the issue of the following day (New Year&#x27;s Day 1904) featured a great deal more victim photos than any other Chicago newspaper.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; created a panel to investigate the causes of the fire, publishing the results in January 1904.

==Political fallout==
The family of Chicago Mayor Harrison owned the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; newspaper. Coverage by Chicago newspapers of what became a political scandal was harsh, particularly from the &quot;Chicago Inter Ocean&quot;, which was owned by traction magnate Charles Yerkes, an opponent of Harrison. 

The January 9, 1904 edition of the &quot;Chicago Eagle&quot; dedicated all eight front-page above-the-fold columns to Harrison&#x27;s alleged role in the disaster, with headlines &quot;Harrison to blame&quot; and &quot;Harrison warned&quot;, with a two-column wide illustration of the mayor under the center headline &quot;Remember!&quot;.

The fire was widely covered by the American and international press, and backlash from the scandal likely was a factor thwarting Harrison&#x27;s bid to become the Democratic Party vice presidential nominee at the Democratic Convention of 1904. The front page of the January 26, 1904 edition of the &quot;Washington Evening Star&quot; featured a story about the Chicago coroner&#x27;s jury findings headlined &quot;Harrison arrested&quot;. 

First elected in 1897 and reelected in 1899, 1901, and 1903, Harrison did not run for reelection in 1905. His 1907 bid to return to the mayor&#x27;s office failed. However, he was again elected mayor in 1911 (to a four-year term) but was defeated for re-election in 1915.

==Legacy==
=== Memorials ===
Iroquois Memorial Hospital was built as a memorial to the fire. The hospital held a bronze bas-relief memorial by sculptor Lorado Taft. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the marker on December 31, 1911 as depicting &quot;the Motherhood of the World protecting the children of the universe, the body of a child borne on a litter by herculean male figures, with a bereaved mother bending over it.&quot; The bronze memorial was removed from the Iroquois Hospital when the building was demolished in 1951. It was placed in storage in City Hall until it was installed in its current location, near the building&#x27;s LaSalle Street entrance, in 1960. The memorial was rededicated on November 5, 2010, and a descriptive plaque was donated by the Union League Club of Chicago. The dedication was attended by members of the Chicago City Council, the Union League Club and Taft&#x27;s granddaughter.

Chicago held an annual memorial service at City Hall until the last survivors died.

Five years after the fire, Andrew Kircher, founder of Montrose Cemetery, erected a memorial on the grounds to memorialize the tragedy.

=== Changes to building codes ===
The Iroquois fire prompted widespread implementation of the panic bar, first invented in the United Kingdom following the Victoria Hall disaster. Panic exit devices are now required by building codes for high-occupancy spaces.

Following the fire, it was required that an asbestos fire curtain (or sheet-metal screen) be raised before each performance and lowered afterward to separate the audience from the stage.

Another result was that all doors in public buildings must open in the direction of egress, but that practice did not become national until the Collinwood School Fire of 1908.

<doc id="737267" wikidata="Q4390685" url="?curid=737267" title="X video extension">
<text>The X video extension, often abbreviated as XVideo or Xv, is a video output mechanism for the X Window System. The protocol was designed by David Carver; the specification for version 2 of the protocol was written in July 1991. It is mainly used today to resize video content in the video controller hardware in order to enlarge a given video or to watch it in full screen mode. Without XVideo, X would have to do this scaling on the main CPU. That requires a considerable amount of processing power, which could slow down or degrade the video stream; video controllers are specifically designed for this kind of computation, so can do it much more cheaply. Similarly, the X video extension can have the video controller perform color space conversions, and change the contrast, brightness, and hue of a displayed video stream.

In order for this to work, three things have to come together:

* The video controller has to provide the required functions.
* The device driver software for the video controller and the X display server program have to implement the XVideo interface.
* The video playback software has to make use of this interface.

Most modern video controllers provide the functions required for XVideo; this feature is known as &quot;hardware scaling and YUV acceleration&quot; or sometimes as &quot;2D hardware acceleration&quot;. The XFree86 X display server has implemented XVideo since version 4.0.2. To check whether a given X display server supports XVideo, one can use the utility codice_1. To check whether the video controller provides the required functions and whether the X device driver implements XVideo for any of them, one can use the codice_2 program.

Video playback programs that run under the X Window system, such as MPlayer, MythTV or xine, typically have an option to enable XVideo output. It is very advisable to switch on this option if the system GPU video-hardware and device drivers supports XVideo and more modern rendering systems such as OpenGL and VDPAU are unavailable – the speedup is very noticeable even on a fast CPU.

While the protocol itself has features for reading and writing of video streams from and to video adapters, in practice today only the functions codice_3 and codice_4 are used: the client program repeatedly prepares images and passes them on to the graphics hardware to be scaled, converted and displayed.

== Display ==

After video has been scaled and prepared for display on the video card, it must be displayed. There are a few possible ways to display accelerated video at this stage. Since full acceleration means that the video controller is responsible for scaling, converting, and drawing the video, the technique used depends entirely on what the video is being drawn onto.

=== The role of window manager support and compositing ===

Under X, how video is finally drawn depends largely on the X window manager in use. With properly installed drivers, and GPU hardware such as supported Intel, ATI, and nVidia chip sets, some window managers, called compositing window managers, allow windows to be separately processed and then rendered (or composited). This involves all windows being rendered to separate output buffers in memory first, and later combined to form a complete graphical interface. While in (video) memory, individual windows can be transformed separately, and accelerated video may be added at this stage using a texture filter, before the window is composited and drawn. XVideo can also be used to accelerate video playback during the drawing of windows using an OpenGL Framebuffer Object or pbuffer.

Metacity, an X window manager uses compositing in this way. The compositing can also make use of 3D pipelines accelerations such as GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap. Among other things, this process allows many video outputs to share the same screen without interfering with each other. Other compositing window managers such as Compiz also use compositing.

However, on a system with limited OpenGL acceleration function, specifically the lack of an OpenGL Framebuffer Object or pbuffer, the use of an OpenGL environment like Xgl makes xv hardware accelerations impossible.

=== The disadvantages of chroma keying ===

In the event that the window manager doesn&#x27;t directly support compositing, it is more difficult to isolate where the video stream should be rendered, because by the time it can be accelerated the output has already been turned into a single image. The only way to do this is usually to employ a post processed hardware overlay, using chroma keying. After all of the windows have already been drawn, the only pieces of information we have available are the size and position of the video window&#x27;s canvas. A third piece of information is required to indicate which parts of the video window&#x27;s canvas are obscured by other windows and which are not. Therefore, the video player draws its canvas using a solid color (we&#x27;ll say green), and this color becomes a makeshift third dimension. When all windows have been drawn, windows covering the video player will block out the green color. When the video stream is added to the output, the graphics card can simply scan the co-ordinates of the canvas. When it encounters green, it knows it has found a visible portion of the video window, and only draws those portions of the video. This same process was also the only available option to render hardware accelerated video under Microsoft Windows XP and earlier, since its window management features were so deeply embedded into the operating system that accelerating them would have been impossible.

If the window manager doesn&#x27;t support compositing, post processed hardware overlays using chroma keying as described in the previous paragraph can make it impossible to produce a proper screenshots of Xvideo applications. It can also make it impossible to view this kind of playback on a secondary display when only one overlay is allowed at the hardware level.

<doc id="737270" wikidata="Q1153745" url="?curid=737270" title="Galero">
<text>A &#x27; (plural: &#x27;; from , originally connoting a helmet made of skins; cf. &quot;galea&quot;) is a broad-brimmed hat with tasselated strings which was worn by clergy in the Catholic Church. Over the centuries, the red &quot;galero&quot; was restricted to use by individual cardinals while such other colors as black, green and violet were reserved to clergy of other ranks and styles.

== Description ==
When creating a cardinal, the pope used to place a scarlet &quot;galero&quot; on the new cardinal&#x27;s head during the papal consistories, the practice giving rise to the phrase &quot;receiving the red hat.&quot; In 1969, Pope Paul VI issued a decree ending the use of the &quot;galero&quot;. Since that time, only the scarlet &quot;zucchetto&quot; and &quot;biretta&quot; are placed over the heads of cardinals during the papal consistory. Some cardinals continue to obtain a &quot;galero&quot; privately so that the custom of suspending it over their tombs may be observed. Raymond Cardinal Burke has been known to publicly wear the &quot;galero&quot; on occasion in the 21st century.

A few cardinals from Eastern Catholic &quot;sui iuris&quot; Churches don their distinctive headdresses particular to the Churches. Other ecclesiastical hats are used by ministers of other Christian communities. Alongside Catholic clergy, the Scots Public Register records its use by Episcopal and Presbyterian ministers. The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland uses a black hat, with blue cords and ten tassels.

Traditionally, the &quot;galero&quot; hangs over a cardinal&#x27;s tomb until it is reduced to dust, symbolizing how all earthly glory is passing. In a cathedral that has no crypt, the &quot;galeri&quot; are suspended from the ceiling. For example, following the death of Basil Cardinal Hume, Archbishop of Westminster, in 1999, his relatives had a &quot;galero&quot; installed above his tomb in Westminster Cathedral, alongside those of his predecessors.

==History==
The privilege of wearing the red &quot;galero&quot; was first granted to cardinals by Pope Innocent IV in 1245 at the First Council of Lyon. Tradition in the Archdiocese of Lyon is that the red color was inspired by the red hats of the canons of Lyon. Pope Innocent wanted his favorites to be distinct and recognizable in the lengthy processions at the council.

Anachronistically, some early Church Fathers are shown wearing a &quot;galero&quot;, notably Saint Jerome frequently is pictured in art either wearing a galero, or with one close by. Even though the office of cardinal did not exist in Jerome&#x27;s day, he had been secretary to Pope Damasus I, which in later days would have made him a cardinal &quot;ex officio&quot;.
Cardinal Jean Cholet used his &quot;galero&quot; to crown Charles of Valois in 1285 at Girona during the Aragonese Crusade, pronouncing him King of Aragon. As a result, &quot;roi du chapeau&quot; (&quot;king of the hat&quot;) became Charles&#x27;s nickname.

The use of the &quot;galero&quot; was abolished in 1969 with instruction &quot;Ut sive sollicite&quot;.
==Ecclesiastical heraldry==
The galero continues to appear today in ecclesiastical heraldry as part of the achievement of the coat of arms of an armigerous Catholic cleric. The galero was originally a wide-brimmed pilgrim&#x27;s hat, like a sombrero. The ecclesiastical hat replaced the helmet and crest, because those were considered too belligerent for men in the clerical estate.

The color of the hat and number of tassels indicate the cleric&#x27;s place in the hierarchy. Generally, priests, abbots and ministers have a black hat with cords and tassels, the number depending upon their rank. Bishops generally use a green hat with green cords and six green tassels on each side, archbishops have likewise a green hat with green cords and ten green tassels on each side, and cardinals have a red hat with red cords and fifteen red tassels on each side. Depiction in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist&#x27;s style.

<text>Peter Lymburner Robertson (December 10, 1879 – September 28, 1951) was a Canadian inventor, industrialist, salesman, and philanthropist who popularized the square-socket drive for screws, often called the Robertson drive. Although a square-socket drive had been conceived decades before (having been patented in 1875 by one Allan Cummings of New York City, ), it had never been developed into a commercial success because the design was difficult to manufacture. Robertson&#x27;s efficient manufacturing technique using cold forming for the screw&#x27;s head is what made the idea a commercial success. 

== Early life ==
Robertson was born in 1879 in Seneca Township, Ontario, part of the historic Haldimand County, as one of six children to parents John and Annie (née Brown) Robertson, both of Scottish heritage. His father left the family to pursue the Gold Rush at the time, and died in 1886.

Robertson&#x27;s second cousin and adopted brother, Gordon MacKenzie, described in an interview with the &quot;Canadian Workshop&quot; magazine that Robertson was &quot;always working on inventions&quot;, and would build models while living at his family farm. 

== Invention of the Robertson Screwnail ==
As a travelling salesman for a Philadelphia tool company, the North Brothers of Philadelphia, in eastern Canadian sales territories, he was demonstrating tools one day when his straight-bladed screwdriver slipped and cut his hand due to the straight slot design. This incident prompted Robertson to design a different drive for screws that would slip less, leading to his square-socket drive. He received his patent for the screw in 1909.

He had originally established his company, the P.L. Robertson Manufacturing Company, in Hamilton, Ontario in 1907. Robertson then relocated the company to produce his screws in Milton, Ontario, the following year after the town had given a $10,000 loan for the factory&#x27;s local establishment. The new location also provided incentives to Robertson&#x27;s factory such as direct roads to the plant, reduced water rates, a sewage disposal system, and a railway siding. During the height of production, the factory had employed over 600 workers. 

The brand has been sold over the years, and the manufacturing for the present corporation (Robertson Inc.) is done in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China; but the Milton, Ontario, building was still a head office for a long time before moving to nearby Burlington, Ontario.

The Fisher Body company, which made the car bodies for the Ford Motor Company, was one of Robertson&#x27;s first customers and used over 700 Robertson screws in its Model T car. Henry Ford, after finding that the screw saved him about 2 hours of work for each car, attempted to get an exclusive licence for the use and manufacture of the Robertson screw in the US. He was turned down by Robertson who felt it was not in his best interest and shortly after that, Ford found that Henry F. Phillips had invented another kind of socket screw and had no such reservations. Although the Robertson screw is most popular in Canada, it is used extensively in boat building because it tends not to slip and damage material, it can be used with one hand, and it is much easier to remove/replace after weathering.

== Investments ==
Robertson also wrote a book, &quot;The Remedy&quot; in 1932, where his writing suggested a strategy to end the Great Depression. It discussed topics including national debts, currencies, and the gold standard. Robertson was interested in the value of gold, where by the 1950s, he had invested in gold mining companies, owning more than 70,000 shares across eight companies.

== Personal life ==
Robertson had a daughter with his housekeeper, Margaret, whose identity was kept private from the public.

By 1946, Robertson&#x27;s health declined due to a combination of his long-time alcoholism and untreated diabetes. He declined insulin treatment despite concern from his family. By October 1946, Robertson was admitted as a patient at The Homewood Sanitarium in Guelph, describing his condition in letters to friends overseas as being &quot;many foul diseases, including diabetes, blindness, and many others.&quot; 

Robertson died September 28, 1951, having a small funeral at his adopted brother&#x27;s home. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery.

== Legacy ==
In 1986, the Milton Historical Society and the Robertson Whitehouse had collaborated to set up two plaques in a ceremony honouring Robertson, one at the original plant building location and one near Robertson&#x27;s former residence. The markers respectively described Robertson&#x27;s manufacturing career and the home Robertson lived in for 35 years. 

In 2001, Robertson was inducted into the Canadian Hardware and Housewares Manufacturers Association Industry Hall of Fame. He was later inducted into the Canadian Manufacturing Hall of Fame (CMHOF) in 2008.

Robertson was inducted into Milton&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2007. The town also has an elementary school named after Robertson that opened in 2009.

In 2002, the documentary &quot;Ode to the Robertson Screwdriver&quot; aired on the History Television&#x27;s &quot;Turning Point&quot; series, describing Robertson&#x27;s life and his career involving the invention of the eponymous screw.

<text>Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau (10 February 1810 – 12 January 1892) was a French biologist.

== Life ==
He was born at Berthézène, in the commune of Valleraugue (Gard), the son of a Protestant farmer. He studied science and then medicine at the University of Strasbourg, where he took the double degree of M.D. and D.Sc., one of his theses being a &quot;Théorie d&#x27;un coup de canon&quot; (November 1829); next year he published a book, &quot;Sur les arolithes&quot;, and in 1832 a treatise on &quot;L&#x27;Extraversion de la vessie&quot;. Moving to Toulouse, he practised medicine for a short time, and contributed various memoirs to the local &quot;Journal de Médecine&quot; and to the &quot;Annales des sciences naturelles&quot; (1834–36). But being unable to continue his research in the provinces, he resigned the chair of zoology to which he had been appointed, and in 1839 settled in Paris, where he found in Henri Milne-Edwards a patron and a friend.

Elected professor of natural history at the Lycée Napoléon in 1850, he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1852, and in 1855 was appointed to the chair of anthropology and ethnography at the Museum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle. Other distinctions followed rapidly, and continued to the end of his otherwise uneventful career, the more important being honorary member of the Royal Society of London (June 1879), member of the Institute and of the Academie de médecine, and commander of the Legion of Honor (1881). In 1891, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. He died in Paris.

He was an accurate observer and unwearied collector of zoological materials, gifted with remarkable descriptive power, and possessed of a clear, vigorous style, but somewhat deficient in deep philosophic insight. Hence his serious studies on the anatomical characters of the lower and higher organisms, man included, will retain their value, while many of his theories and generalizations, especially in the department of ethnology, were already forgotten by the end of the century.

==Evolution==

Quatrefages was critical of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theories but was not anti-evolution. From 1859 he corresponded with Darwin regularly and although they disagreed with each other they stayed on friendly terms. Quatrefages authored &quot;Charles Darwin et ses précurseurs français&quot; (1870), which contained criticism of Darwinism. On receiving the book, Darwin in a letter to Quatrefages commented that &quot;many of your strictures are severe enough, but all are given with perfect courtesy &amp; fairness. I can truly say I would rather be criticised by you in this manner than praised by many others.&quot;

In 1870, Quatrefages and Henri Milne-Edwards nominated Darwin for election as a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in the section of Anatomy and Zoology. This was met with strong opposition from Émile Blanchard, Charles-Philippe Robin and others. Darwin lost the election by a narrow margin.

In his book &quot;L&#x27;Espèce humaine&quot; (translated &quot;The Human Species&quot;, 1879) he disputed the role of natural selection in evolution. Quatrefages proposed that natural &quot;elimination&quot; would have been a more exact term as natural selection does not create new species.

Quatrefages was a strict monogenist and was an opponent of polygenism.

==Works==
The work of de Quatrefages ranged over the whole field of zoology from the annelids and other low organisms to the anthropoids and man. Of his numerous essays in scientific periodicals, the more important were:
*&quot;Considérations sur les caractères zoologiques des rongeurs&quot; (1840)
*&quot;De l&#x27;organisation des animaux sans vertèbres des Côtes de la Manche&quot; (Ann. Sc. Nat., 1844)
*&quot;Recherches sur le système nerveux, l&#x27;embryognie, les organes des sens, et la circulation des annélides&quot; (Ibid., 1844–50)
*&quot;Sur les affinités et les analogies des lombrics et des sangsues&quot; (Ibid.)
*&quot;Sur l&#x27;histoire naturelle des tarets&quot; (Ibid., 1848–49)

Then there is the vast series issued under the general title of &quot;Etudes sur les types inférieurs de l&#x27;embranchement des annelés&quot;, and the results of several scientific expeditions to the Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlands, Italy and Sicily, forming a series of articles in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, or embodied in the &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;un naturaliste&quot; (2 vols., 1854).

These were followed in quick succession by the:
*&quot;Physiologie comparée, métamorphoses de l&#x27;homme et des animaux&quot; (1862)
*&quot;Les Polynésiens et leurs migrations&quot; (1866)
*&quot;Histoire naturelle des Annelés marins et d&#x27;eau douce&quot; (2 vols., 1866)
*&quot;La Rochelle et ses environs&quot; (1866)
*&quot;Rapport sur les progrés de l&#x27;anthropologie&quot; (1867)
*&quot;Charles Darwin et ses précurseurs francais&quot; (1870), a study of evolution in which the writer takes somewhat the same attitude as Alfred Russel Wallace, combating the Darwinian doctrine in its application to man
*&quot;La Race prussienne&quot; (1871)
*&quot;Crania Ethnica&quot;, jointly with Ernest Hamy (2 vols., with 100 plates, 1875–82), a classical work based on French and foreign anthropological data, analogous to the &quot;Crania&quot; of John Thurnam and Joseph Barnard Davis, and to Samuel George Morton&#x27;s &quot;Crania Americana&quot; and &quot;Crania Aegyptiaca&quot;.
*&quot;L&#x27;Espèce humaine&quot; (1877)
*&quot;The Human Species&quot; (1879)
*&quot;Nouvelles études sur la distribution géographique des Négritos&quot; (1882)
*&quot;Hommes fossiles et hommes sauvages&quot; (1884)
*&quot;Histoire générale des races humaines&quot; (2 vols., 1886–89), the first volume being introductory, while the second attempts a complete classification of mankind.
*&quot;Les Pygmées: Avec 31 fig. intercalées dans le texte; Les Pygmées des anciens d&#x27;après la science moderne; negritos ou Pygmées asiatiques; Négrilles ou Pygmées africains; Hottentots et Boschismans&quot; (1887)
*&quot;Les émulés de Darwin&quot; (2 vols., 1894)
