<text>Major Charles Henry John Chetwynd-Talbot, 20th Earl of Shrewsbury, 20th Earl of Waterford, 5th Earl Talbot , KCVO (13 November 1860 – 7 May 1921), styled Viscount Ingestre from 1868 to 1877, was a British peer. Unusually for a wealthy nobleman of the period, he began several businesses connected with road transport, with mixed success.

==Family background==
Shrewsbury, who was born at Eaton Place, Belgravia, London, was the only son and heir of Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 19th Earl of Shrewsbury and 4th Earl Talbot. His grandfather, The 18th Earl of Shrewsbury, had inherited the earldoms from a very distant cousin, and had to prove his claim to the premier earldoms of Great Britain and Ireland on the Roll in the House of Lords by demonstrating his descent from the 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury and 2nd Earl of Waterford. Shrewsbury was the nephew of: Constance, who married The 8th Marquess of Lothian; Gertrude, who married The 13th Earl of Pembroke; and Adelaide, who married The 3rd Earl Brownlow, the brother of Theresa, a notable hostess, who married The 6th Marquess of Londonderry.

==Inheritance==
Shrewsbury&#x27;s very rich father died when Shrewsbury, then styled as Viscount Ingestre, was a schoolboy of 16. All his father&#x27;s property and personal wealth were left to the young Lord Shrewsbury&#x27;s mother. She lived until 1912, when he was aged 51.

==Education and marriage==
Lord Shrewsbury was educated at Eton College and inherited his titles when only 16 years of age. At the age of 19, he eloped with an older married woman, Ellen, &quot;née&quot; Palmer-Morewood, wife of commoner, Alfred Edward Miller Mundy of Shipley Hall, whom she had married in 1873. Ellen was a granddaughter of The 7th Baron Byron (a cousin of The 6th Baron Byron, the famous poet), and already had a daughter. Shrewsbury&#x27;s heir, Lord Ingestre, was born less than three months after the marriage of his parents. Ingestre died in the lifetime of his parents, but had several children, including The 21st Earl of Shrewsbury and 21st Earl of Waterford, the father of the current Earl.

Before his marriage, in July 1879 Shrewsbury began an affair with the actress Lily Langtry, although then married to her husband Edward; in January 1880, Langtry and Shrewsbury were reportedly planning to run away together, but the relationship was superseded by his elopement with his future Countess.

==Public offices and honours==
In right of his peerage, Lord Shrewsbury became Hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland, in which capacity he took part in the coronations of Kings Edward VII and George V, and accompanied the former on his state visit to Dublin in July 1903. He was made KCVO in 1907. He also became High Steward of the Borough of Stafford in 1892.

==Equestrian interests==
He started his own polo club in 1893. In 1895, Lord Shrewsbury founded the Staffordshire Polo Club at his house, Ingestre Hall. Players included The 8th Earl of Harrington, Algernon Burnaby, Captain Daily Fergusson, Captain The Hon. Robert Greville, Gerald Hardy, Albert Jones, Captain &quot;Wendy&quot; Jones, Edward and George Miller, Norman Nickalls, Bertram Portal, Captain Gordon Renton, Jasper Selwyn and John Reid Walker.

===&quot;Greyhound&quot; coach===
A devotee of coach driving, for several seasons Lord Shrewsbury ran the daily &quot;Greyhound&quot; (i.e. fast) coach service the 20 miles from fashionable Buxton Spa to his house, Alton Towers, now the site of a theme park.
==Investing in personal transportation==
===Hansom cabs de luxe===
For many years he was in business as a hansom cab owner, his vehicles marked &quot;S.T.&quot; (for Shrewsbury and Talbot) and the horses &quot;being of the best possible quality&quot;, and he was the first owner to have cabs that were fitted with noiseless tyres operating in London and Paris.

To begin with, drivers paid £1 a day for the use of the horse and cab, keeping the remainder of their takings. In slack periods the drivers would strike, asking Lord Shrewsbury for a price reduction. In the summer of 1888, he floated a public listed company, The Shrewsbury and Talbot Cab and Noiseless Tyre Company Limited, to buy two businesses. Firstly, the business of cab proprietor and job master worked by the earl himself, and secondly the business of The Noiseless Tyre Company Limited, manufacturers of steel and rubber tyres in Manchester and London.

In the spring of 1891, following almost annual strikes by his cab drivers, Lord Shrewsbury put his company&#x27;s 300 horses up for sale, under police protection, in the company&#x27;s Battersea premises. At that time they operated from a number of yards in different parts of London. The press reported the terms offered to drivers in detail, then the prices of the horses, and advised that every animal put up for sale had been sold. Strong competition from other rubber tyred cabs seems to have become a serious problem. The business was restarted in October 1891 with cabmen friendly to the company.

==Motoring==
In November 1900, Lord Shrewsbury formed another public listed company, Shrewsbury S T and Challiner Tyre Company Limited, to manufacture and deal in cabs, carriages, motor cars, cycles, vehicles, tyres, tubes, wire, India rubber and gutta percha goods, etc. In December 1903, he was described in a court action brought by Dunlop over the importation of Michelin tyres as &quot;proprietor of the business known as Maison Talbot in London&#x27;s Long Acre managed by Mr Weigel.&quot;

In March 1901 he formed British Automobile Commercial Syndicate Limited &quot;with objects sufficiently indicated by the title&quot;. The shareholders were not people of note but provided addresses in the then almost semi-rural Ladbroke Grove, Notting Hill, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush areas and Hatton Garden EC. One of the shareholders was a Mr R. Weigel of 25 Maxilla Gardens, North Kensington. Lord Shrewsbury was the first chairman. The other first directors were M. Chabert, president of the &quot;Société Commerciale d&#x27;Automobiles&quot;, Paris, and Mr D.M. Weigel, managing director. The new premises, (formerly occupied by carriage builders) at 97-98 Long Acre (adjoining 1 Endell Street), covered &quot;four large floors&quot;. Twelve months later, Lord Shrewsbury was made chairman of Messrs J. Rothschild and Son Limited, incorporated to carry on the business of making motor car bodies by expanding the London activities of the well-known French businesses of Clément-Rothschild and Messrs J. Rothschild and Son. The second floor of the same building was to be &quot;Maison Talbot&quot;, suppliers of Talbot tyres (as fitted by The Hon. C.S. Rolls), the third floor to be automobile clothing. In March 1909, Shrewsbury made a formal announcement that he would close the business which could be seen to be competing with his Talbot agents.

In 1909, he floated Homoil Trust Limited, leading a board of the late engineer-in-chief of the Navy, another colliery owner and a well-known consulting engineer. The company was formed to purchase and develop various patents for the production of a cheaper home-produced and more efficient substitute for petrol made from coal-tar. It was voluntarily wound up at the end of 1910.

===Talbot motorcars===
Lord Shrewsbury founded Clément-Talbot Limited in 1902. He built for it the United Kingdom&#x27;s first purpose-built automotive-manufacturing plant in London&#x27;s North Kensington with his own personal crest set high above the entrance to the administration building. He involved Adolphe Clément-Bayard as his &quot;engineer&quot; and began by importing his popular French Clément-Bayard cars into Britain.

At Brooklands in November 1912, Lord Shrewsbury&#x27;s Talbot car of only 25.6 horsepower rating, driven by Percy Lambert, attained a speed of 113.28 miles per hour and broke many other class records. The only faster car on the Brooklands track was a Mercedes-Benz of 84.8 horsepower rating.
==Military service==
The Earl served entirely on home service in Britain during the First World War. He was a Major in the Army Remount Service of the Army Service Corps from 1914 to 1915, and temporary Major with the Royal Welch Fusiliers 1916 to 1917. In January 1915, his only son, Viscount Ingestre, a reservist in the Royal Horse Guards at Regent&#x27;s Park Barracks, died in London of influenza followed by pneumonia.

==Later life==
Lord Shrewsbury died in May 1921, aged 60, and was buried at the parish church of Ingestre. There then ensued an inheritance battle for his estate between his wife and his grandson. His grandson, John, 21st Earl of Shrewsbury, claimed the late 20th Earl had not been of sound mind when his last will was written and won a court settlement. Ellen left the house the late Earl had built for her, &#x27;Cariad&#x27; in Goring-on-Thames, moving to &#x27;Cariad Cottage&#x27; in an equally tranquil setting. Prior to Lord Shrewsbury&#x27;s death, he had already bequeathed her the sum of £2,000 per month until she died.

<doc id="734716" wikidata="Q333132" url="?curid=734716" title="Gwynfor Evans">
<text>Gwynfor Richard Evans (1 September 1912 – 21 April 2005) was a Welsh politician, lawyer and author. He was President of the Welsh political party Plaid Cymru for thirty-six years and was the first member of Parliament to represent it at Westminster, which he did twice, from 1966 to 1970, and again from 1974 to 1979.

On entering the House of Commons, he famously failed in his attempt to obtain permission to take the oath in the Welsh language. He was the first MP to attempt to do so, but the right to take the oath in any of the UK&#x27;s non-English native languages was not granted until 1974. His most notable achievement was his successful campaign for the creation of a Welsh-language television channel.

==Early life==
Gwynfor Evans was born in Barry, near Cardiff, to Dan Evans and Catherine Richard. He had a brother named Alcwyn, and a sister named Ceridwen. His father ran a chain of shops in Barry, and his mother a china shop. His mother was a fluent Welsh speaker. As a boy, he was educated at Gladstone Road School. Later on, he was educated at Barry County School, where he was captain of the school&#x27;s cricket and hockey teams. The area was mostly English-speaking; at school, he began learning the Welsh language but did not become fully fluent until the age of seventeen.

Evans studied at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, from where he qualified as a lawyer. During his time at St John&#x27;s, he became a member of the Dafydd ap Gwilym society there. He was also a market gardener. He was a teenager when the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru was founded in 1925, and he founded a branch of the party while he was at Oxford. He became the party&#x27;s president in 1945 and retained the office until 1981.

A pacifist, he became active in Heddychwyr Cymru, a Welsh organisation closely associated with the Peace Pledge Union, serving as secretary and editor of a series of pamphlets throughout the Second World War. A committed Christian also, he declared himself a conscientious objector and was required to appear before a tribunal which, recognising the firmness of his beliefs, registered him unconditionally.

Evans is credited with keeping Plaid Cymru going through the lean years of the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, he campaigned unsuccessfully for a Welsh parliament. He joined locals Dafydd Roberts and Elizabeth May Watkin Jones in their protest against the closure and flooding of their village Capel Celyn. This was because of the plan to dam the Tryweryn River to supply the city of Liverpool with water. This was a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in Wales in the early 1960s.

In 1962, Evans joined Wales West and North Television, in which he was one of the leading figures in the venture. It won the ITV franchise for western and northern Wales, but the venture failed because of financial difficulties, and the company was merged with another station, Television Wales and the West.

==Electoral record==

===Local government and first parliamentary contests===

Evans was elected to Carmarthenshire County Council in 1949, keeping his seat for the next 25 years, usually as the lone Plaid Cymru representative, acquiring the nickname &quot;Evans dual carriageway&quot; for his emphasis on improving transport links. In 1973, following the abolition of Carmarthenshire County Council, Evans failed to be elected to the new Dyfed County Council. Evans contested Merioneth at the general elections of 1945, 1950, 1955 and 1959, and the 1954 Aberdare by-election.

===1966 Carmarthen by-election===
In 1964 Evans transferred his candidature to Carmarthen. On 14 July 1966, Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen from Labour in a by-election caused by the death of Lady Megan Lloyd George, daughter of the former Liberal prime minister, David Lloyd George, having come third in the general election just a few weeks before. He had also contested the seat at the 1964 general election. His by-election victory is regarded as a seminal moment for Plaid Cymru. He was shown around the House of Commons by fellow pacifist Emrys Hughes, the son-in-law of Keir Hardie; on pointing out the Welsh Labour table in the Commons&#x27; tea room, Hughes warned him, &quot;You&#x27;d better not sit down there, your name&#x27;s mud among that lot.&quot;

On entering the House of Commons, he famously failed in his attempt to obtain permission to take the oath in the Welsh language. He was the first MP to attempt to do so, but the right to take the oath in any of the UK&#x27;s non-English native languages was not granted until 1974.

===Later electoral record===
In the 1970 general election Evans lost his Carmarthen seat to Labour&#x27;s Gwynoro Jones and failed to regain it in the February 1974 general election by only three votes. He regained the seat, with a majority of 3,640 votes, in the October 1974 general election, when he returned to Parliament accompanied by two other Plaid Cymru MPs, Dafydd Wigley and Dafydd Elis Thomas.

Evans lost Carmarthen once more at the 1979 general election, to Roger Thomas (also Labour). He was unsuccessful in the 1983 general election, and did not contest any further elections.

==Career as an MP==
In the House of Commons, Evans was true to his pacifist principles in being one of the few MPs to oppose the British government&#x27;s support of the Nigerian federal government with supplies of weapons in the civil war against Biafra (1967–1970). He also opposed the Vietnam War: after being denied entry to the country as part of an inspection group, he instead protested outside a US air base in Thailand.

Evans was the first (and last) president of the Celtic League 1961–71. Robert McIntyre of the SNP was vice-president at the time.

==Later life==
His most notable achievement was his successful campaign for the creation of a Welsh-language television channel. In 1980 his threat to go on hunger strike, after the Conservative government reneged on its election promise of a Welsh language television channel, was instrumental in bringing about an early U-turn on the part of Margaret Thatcher, and S4C began broadcasting on 1 November 1982.

In his political retirement he became a prolific writer, mainly on Welsh subjects and writing in Welsh with simultaneous or later English editions. His work &quot;Aros Mae&quot; (&quot;It Endures&quot;) (published 1971), a comprehensive history of Wales, and the English-language version &quot;Land of my Fathers: 2000 Years of Welsh History&quot; (published 1974), had already become best-sellers.

==Personal life==
In 1941 Evans married Rhiannon Prys Thomas, who survived him by nine months, dying on 13 January 2006. They had seven children. Their daughter, Meinir, became a prominent Welsh-language activist and married Ffred Ffransis.

==Death==
Evans died at his home in Pencarreg on 21 April 2005 at the age of 92.

===Tributes===

On his death the Welsh political establishment united in paying its respects to Gwynfor Evans:
*&quot;Without Gwynfor Evans at the helm Plaid Cymru may not have survived to see electoral success in later years. His influence was felt beyond the confines of party politics. Wales would not be the nation it is today — perhaps would not be counted as a nation at all — if not for Gwynfor Evans.&quot; — Dafydd Iwan, President of Plaid Cymru.
*&quot;Although his relationships with Labour MPs were not always positive, there is no gainsaying his massive contribution to Welsh public life, and particularly in raising the profile of Wales and Welsh issues throughout his long career in Welsh and British politics.&quot; – Rhodri Morgan, First Minister of the Welsh Government (Labour).
*&quot;Gwynfor Evans made a distinguished contribution to Welsh public life and will be remembered particularly for his advancement of the Welsh language.&quot; – Peter Hain, Secretary of State for Wales (Labour).
*&quot;Wales has lost one of its most significant figures of modern times. Gwynfor Evans was a highly respected figure who made a major contribution to Welsh politics. His record on delivering Welsh language broadcasting for Wales is of particular importance.&quot; – Nick Bourne, Leader of the Welsh Conservative Party.
*&quot;&quot;Gwynfor served his party well and was able to bring them into electoral success. He earned respect from across the political spectrum. His passing marks the end of a chapter in Welsh political history&quot;.&quot; – Mike German, Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats.
*A campaign was launched to build a permanent monument to Gwynfor Evans in Carmarthen.
*A campaign by local primary school teacher, Gwenno Hughes, to establish a permanent memorial to Evans, in the town of his birth, culminated in the unveiling of a bronze bust created by the sculptor John Meirion Morris at Barry Library in 2010. The cost of the memorial was raised by the staff of the local school Ysgol Gymraeg Sant Baruc.

<text>Robert William Unser (February 20, 1934 – May 2, 2021) was an American automobile racer. At his induction into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1994, he had the fourth most IndyCar Series wins at 35 (behind his brother Al, A. J. Foyt, and Mario Andretti). Unser won the 1968 and 1974 United States Automobile Club (USAC) national championships. He won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb overall title 10 times (13 times when class wins are included).

He was the nephew of Louis Unser, brother of Al, Jerry Unser and Louie Unser, the father of Robby Unser and the uncle of Al Unser Jr. and Johnny Unser. The Unser family has won the Indianapolis 500 a record nine times, with Bobby and Al Unser Sr. being the only set of brothers to win in the race&#x27;s history. Bobby Unser was one of ten drivers to have won the 500 three or more times and the first of two (followed by Rick Mears) to have won in three decades (1968, 1975, 1981).

==Early life==
Unser was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the son of Mary Catherine (Craven) and Jerome Henry Unser, the third oldest of four brothers. When he turned one, his family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico where his father started a garage on U.S. Route 66. From 1953 to 1955, he served in the United States Air Force and became a top competition sharpshooter in military matches.

==Racing career==
===Early career===
Unser began racing in 1949 in a Modified at Roswell Speedway. In 1950, at the age of 15, he won his first championship in Southwest Modified Stock Cars. In 1955, Bobby and brothers Jerry and Al Unser decided to pursue racing careers in USAC. In 1959, his brother Jerry Unser died in a practice crash for the 1959 Indianapolis 500.

===Pikes Peak International Hill Climb===
He debuted in 1955 at Pike&#x27;s Peak, dubbed &quot;Unser&#x27;s Peak&quot; because of his family&#x27;s history of success at the hill climb. He finished fifth that year, behind his two brothers. A year later, he won his first championship at Pikes Peak. He won six straight titles from 1958 to 1963. His streak ended in 1964 when his younger brother Al won the race.

He leads the all-time Pikes Peak International Hill Climb champion&#x27;s list with 10 overall wins, having set a new track record eight times. Unser&#x27;s record time was broken by Michele Mouton, so Audi approached Unser asking if he would want to attempt to take the record back. In 1986, after a 12-year absence from the Pikes Peak race, he won the event for the tenth time driving an Audi Quattro. He eclipsed Mouton&#x27;s time by 16 seconds. The win also broke the tie he had with his Uncle Louis Unser for nine overall victories each. The 1986 win brought Unser&#x27;s total number of Pikes Peak victories to 13, including two stock car class victories (1969 and 1974) and a single sports car class win (1963).

===IndyCar career===
Unser came from a family of racecar drivers. He won numerous racing championships throughout his career, including three Indianapolis 500 titles. When asked in 2008 about his potential to move from midget and sprint cars, Unser said, &quot;I never considered Indianapolis because I didn&#x27;t think I was good enough. But Rufus (Parnelli Jones) told me I was going and he got me a ride and I always be indebted to him.&quot;
Unser made his IndyCar debut in 1962 (excluding the Pikes Peak races which were part of the IndyCar season in the 1950s). He raced for Andy Granatelli between 1963 and 1965 with a Novi engine. Unser raced in his first Indianapolis 500 in 1963. He crashed early and placed 33rd. Unser&#x27;s second Indianapolis 500 in 1964 ended on the second lap in the crash that killed Eddie Sachs and Dave MacDonald. Unser moved to an IndyCar owned by Bob Willke from 1966 until 1970. His first IndyCar win came in 1967 at Mosport, in Ontario. A year later, Unser won his first Indianapolis 500, setting the record as the first driver to race over 170 miles per hour at Indianapolis. In 1968, Unser worked with crew chief Jud Phillips and won his first USAC National Driving Championship with wins at Stardust International Raceway, Phoenix Raceway, Trenton Speedway, Indy, and the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.
In 1972, Unser started working for Dan Gurney&#x27;s All American Racers team and a John Miller Offenhauser engine. He set another Indianapolis 500 record for the fastest qualifying time at . Teams were allowed to bolt on a wing for the first time and speeds rose significantly (the previous record speed was ). Unser won nine pole positions (in ten races) and won four of the races. In 1974, he won his second USAC National Driving Championship. In 13 races, Unser won four times, took second four times, and finished in the top five twelve times. In the 1975 Indianapolis 500, he won his second 500 in a race that was rain-shortened on lap 174 because of torrential rains. Unser won twice in 1976 as part of the Fletcher Racing Team. He remained on Gurney&#x27;s team until 1979. 
From 1979 to 1981, Unser raced in the CART series for Team Penske. Roger Penske wanted a proven winner to join his young driver Rick Mears. Unser won six times to Mears&#x27; three wins but Mears won the championship and Indianapolis 500. In 1980 he became the first driver to win the California 500 four times. Unser won four times in 1980 and finished second in the season championship to Johnny Rutherford. His career ended in 1981 following a controversial win at Indianapolis.

====1981 Indianapolis 500 controversy====

Unser was the center of one of the most controversial finishes in Indy 500 history at the 1981 Indianapolis 500. Unser won the pole in the No. 3 Roger Penske-owned car and led the most laps (89 laps).

On lap 149, during a caution period, Unser and Mario Andretti made their pit stops and headed back to the race. Unser passed eight cars during the caution, while Andretti passed two cars. Unser won the race by 5.18 seconds, but was stripped of it the following morning in favor of second-place finisher Andretti. Andretti drove the only other car on the lead lap at the end. After a five-month lawsuit and protest by Penske, Unser was re-awarded the win in October 1981. For his infraction, Unser was instead fined $40,000 ($ in today&#x27;s money). Unser retired during off-season testing for Pat Patrick at Phoenix.
In his autobiography &quot;Winners are Driven&quot;, Unser expressed his beliefs that the debacle was politically motivated and that USAC disqualified him (and benefited Andretti), hoping to start a falling-out between Pat Patrick, Andretti&#x27;s car owner and owner of Patrick Racing, and Roger Penske (owner of Unser&#x27;s car), in order to destroy CART. He claimed that Patrick&#x27;s team did not protest the finish and that Patrick was on Unser&#x27;s side in the controversy. For years, Unser and Andretti did not speak to each other willingly until early 2017 when Unser announced on his YouTube channel that Andretti reached out to wish him the best after Unser got extremely sick.

===Other achievements===
Unser was the 1975 International Race of Champions (IROC) champion and won the 1993 Fast Masters championship.

Unser challenged Dan Gurney to improve the performance of his 1971 USAC car, leading to the development of the Gurney flap. In 1993, Unser set a new Bonneville Salt Flats record at Bonneville Speedway of 223.709 in a D/Gas Modified Roadster that stood for 18 years. 

In 2003, he published a book, &quot;Winners are Driven: A Champion&#x27;s Guide to Success in Business and Life&quot;.

==Broadcaster==

Unser was a television broadcaster for 20 years after his retirement from racing. He was a television commentator for IndyCar races after his retirement working for NBC, ABC, and ESPN. Unser also worked as the analyst for the IMS Radio Network in 1986. In 1989, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded ABC&#x27;s telecast of the Indianapolis 500 the Sports Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Live Sports Special&quot;. Unser received announcer honors with Paul Page and Sam Posey. 

Unser was announcing in the booth for his brother Al&#x27;s record-tying fourth Indy 500 victory in 1987 and Al&#x27;s 1985 CART championship. He also called his nephew Al Jr.&#x27;s first Indy 500 victory in the 1992 Indianapolis 500 and second in 1994.

Unser also broadcast several NASCAR events between 1986 and 1992 alongside Page and Benny Parsons. The most famous NASCAR race Unser broadcast was the 1989 The Winston in which Rusty Wallace won by wrecking Darrell Waltrip with 2 laps to go; Unser was the first broadcaster of the broadcasting team to spot the post-race fist-fight between Wallace and Waltrip&#x27;s pit crews.

==Awards==
*Unser was selected as one of Sports Illustrated&#x27;s &quot;Top Five Athletes&quot; in the popular magazine&#x27;s first twenty years, along with the Martini &amp; Rossi and Olsonite &quot;Driver of the Year&quot; awards in 1974.
*Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame (1990) 
*International Motorsports Hall of Fame (1990)
*Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (1994)
*National Sprint Car Hall of Fame (1997)
*Pikes Peak Hill Climb Museum Hall of Fame (1997)
*Colorado Sports Hall of Fame (2011)

*He was presented with Indy 500 Front Row Award in 1999, for being a nine-time front row qualifier (1968, 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1977, 1980, 1981).
*He was selected fourth in The Greatest 33 list of Indianapolis 500 drivers in 2011.

==Federal criminal charges==
On December 20, 1996 in Colorado, Unser and a friend became lost while snowmobiling near Unser&#x27;s New Mexico ranch. They abandoned one stuck snowmobile before a storm blinded them both. When the second snowmobile stopped working, they spent two days and nights in subzero weather before finding a barn where they were found. Both men were suffering badly; his friend was suffering from hypothermia, and Unser had vomited blood during this time. Unser was later convicted of a Federal misdemeanor, &quot;unlawful operation of a snowmobile within a National Forest Wilderness Area&quot; (16 U.S.C. 551, 36 C.F.R. 261.16(a)), and was fined $75. Maximum penalties could have been up to six months in jail and up to $5,000.00 in fines. Unser appealed, claiming to have been lost before the accident, but the court ruled that maps were widely available and it was a public welfare offense, thus intent was not necessary. Unser appealed this decision all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but his writ of certiorari was denied.

==Death==
Unser died on May 2, 2021, at the age of 87 at his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico from natural causes. Page spoke at his funeral service; Andretti and Roger Penske spoke via videotape. Pallbearers outside of the Unser family include Willy T. Ribbs, Johnny Rutherford, and Rick Galles. He was interred at Sunset Memorial Park.

Unser was the father of two sons, Bobby Jr. and Robby, and two daughters, Cindy and Jeri. Unser coached Robby for the 1998 and 1999 Indianapolis 500. Bobby Unser Jr., who participated in racing before giving it up to pursue stunt car driving, music, and horse breeding, died less than two months after his father at the age of 65, as a result of complications from hip surgery.

<text>Louis Untermeyer (October 1, 1885 – December 18, 1977) was an American poet, anthologist, critic, and editor. He was appointed the fourteenth Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1961.

==Life and career==
Untermeyer was born in New York City, the son of a German-Jewish jewelry manufacturer. He initially joined his father&#x27;s firm as a designer, rising to the rank of vice president, before resigning from the firm in 1923 to devote himself to literary pursuits. He was, for the most part, self-educated.

He married Jean Starr in January 1907, and their son Richard was born in December of that year. (Richard Untermeyer died by suicide in January 1927 while studying at Yale, at the age of 19.) After a 1926 divorce, they were reunited in 1929, after which they adopted two sons, Laurence and Joseph. He married the poet Virginia Moore (1903–1993) in 1927; their son, John Moore Untermeyer (1928), was renamed John Fitzallen Moore after a painful 1929 divorce. In the 1930s, he divorced Jean Starr Untermeyer and married Esther Antin (1894–1983). This relationship also ended in divorce in 1945. In 1948, he married Bryna Ivens, an editor of &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine.

Untermeyer&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;First Love&quot; (1911), reflected the influences of Heinrich Heine and British poet Laurence Housman. His next collection, &quot;Challenge&quot; (1914), showed his growing maturity as a poet.
Untermeyer was known for his wit and his love of puns. For a while, he held Marxist beliefs, writing for magazines such as &quot;The Masses&quot;, through which he advocated that the United States stay out of World War I. After the suppression of that magazine by the U.S. government, he joined &quot;The Liberator&quot;, published by the Workers Party of America. Later he wrote for the independent socialist magazine &quot;The New Masses&quot;. He was a co-founder, in 1916, of &quot;The Seven Arts&quot;, a poetry magazine that is credited for introducing many new poets, including Robert Frost, who became Untermeyer&#x27;s long-term friend and correspondent.

On May 1, 1935, Untermeyer joined the League of American Writers (1935–1943), whose members included Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Frank Folsom, Alexander Trachtenberg, I.F. Stone, Myra Page, Millen Brand, and Arthur Miller. (Members were largely either Communist Party members or fellow travelers.)

In 1950, Untermeyer was a panelist during the first year of the &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; television quiz program. According to Bennett Cerf, Untermeyer would sign virtually any piece of paper that someone placed in front of him, and Untermeyer inadvertently signed a few Communist proclamations. According to Cerf, Untermeyer was not at all a communist, but he had joined several suspect societies that made him stand out. He was named during the hearings by the House Committee on Un-American Activities investigating communist subversion. The Catholic War Veterans and right-wing organizations began hounding Untermeyer. Goodson-Todman, producer of the show, did not act on the protests against Untermeyer for some time, but finally war veterans began picketing outside the New York City television studio from which &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; was telecast live. The pressure became too great, and the sponsor Jules Montenier, inventor of Stopette deodorant, said, &quot;After all, I&#x27;m paying a lot of money for this. I can&#x27;t afford to have my product picketed.&quot;

At that point, the producers told Untermeyer that he had to leave the television series. The last live telecast on which he appeared was on March 11, 1951, and the mystery guest he questioned while blindfolded was Celeste Holm. The kinescope of this episode has been lost. His exit led to Bennett Cerf becoming a permanent member of the program.

The controversy surrounding Untermeyer led to him being blacklisted by the television industry. According to Untermeyer&#x27;s friend Arthur Miller, Untermeyer became so depressed by his forced departure from &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; that he refused to leave his home in Brooklyn for more than a year, and his wife Bryna answered all incoming phone calls. It was she who eventually told Miller what had happened because Untermeyer would not pick up the phone to talk to him, even though Miller&#x27;s support of blacklisted writers and radio and television personalities was well-known to Untermeyer and many others. But for more than a year, whenever Miller dialed the Untermeyers&#x27; phone number, Bryna &quot;talked obscurely about [her husband Louis] not wanting phone conversations anymore, preferring to wait until we could all get together again,&quot; wrote Miller.

Miller was a &quot;very infrequent television watcher&quot; in 1951, according to words he used in his 1987 autobiography, and so he did not notice that Bennett Cerf had replaced Untermeyer on the live TV game show. Miller did read New York City newspapers every day, but apparently there was no published report of Untermeyer&#x27;s disappearance from television, so Miller was unaware that anything was wrong until Untermeyer&#x27;s wife Bryna eventually revealed what the problem was. After that, Untermeyer conversed with Miller by phone for more than a year.

Louis Untermeyer was the author or editor of close to 100 books, from 1911 until his death. Many of them and his other memorabilia are preserved in a special section of the Lilly Library at Indiana University. Schools used his Modern American and British poetry books widely, and they often introduced college students to poetry. He and Bryna Ivens Untermeyer created a number of books for young people, under the Golden Treasury of Children&#x27;s Literature. Untermeyer also rounded up contributors for a Modern Masters for Children series published by Crowell-Collier Press in the 1960s—the books were designed to have a vocabulary of 800 words and contributors included Robert Graves, Phylis McGinley, and Shirley Jackson. He lectured on literature for many years, both in the US and other countries. In 1956 the Poetry Society of America awarded Untermeyer a Gold Medal. He also served as the Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress from 1961 until 1963.

<doc id="734725" wikidata="Q48168" url="?curid=734725" title="National emblem of East Germany">
<text>The national emblem of East Germany featured a hammer and a compass, surrounded by a ring of wheat. It was an example of what has been called &quot;socialist heraldry&quot;. It was the only heraldic device of a European socialist state with a ring of grain which does not contain a red star.

==Description==
The emblem adopted in 1955 depicted a hammer and compass surrounded by ears of wheat wrapped in the colours of the German flag. The hammer represented the workers in the factories. The compass represented the intelligentsia, and the rings of wheat the farmers. The first designs included only the hammer and ring of wheat, as an expression of the GDR as a communist (German for &quot;Workers&#x27; and Farmers&#x27; state&quot;). When the federated states in East Germany were abolished and replaced by , making the GDR into a unitary state, the national emblem came to be used by the too. The East German government did not want regional symbols to be used, since they could stir up regional patriotism and movements for independence.

==History==
===Early proposals===

Shortly after the German Democratic Republic was established, work began to create a national emblem for the new state. One of the projects of the coat of arms from November 1949 a variation of the German eagle with its head facing to the sinister side heraldically, encircled by the words &quot;&#x27;&quot;. This proposal was ultimately never used. Another proposal created by at the request of FDJ chairman Erich Honecker was done in the socialist style similar to that of the Soviet Union, depicting two wreaths of wheat wrapped with ribbons with the German national colours, with a ribbon in the center with the text &quot;&#x27;&quot;, with the name of the state above a hammer within a gear. However, the design was not adopted as Behrendt was accused of being a Titoist and arrested in December 1949. Nevertheless, many of the elements in Behrendt&#x27;s proposal such as the German tricolour ribbons and the hammer were eventually used in the emblem and its subsequent versions.

===Unofficial emblems===
Prior to 1955, the German Democratic Republic had no official state emblem. However, laws on passports and seals enacted in 1950 and 1953 respectively depicted an emblem that was &quot;de facto&quot; used as the national emblem. In spite of such use, Minister-President Otto Grotewohl urged that these emblems were semiofficial and should not be referred to as a national emblem in 1951.
On 12 January 1950, a regulation on diplomatic and official passports essentially marked the adoption of the first version of the national emblem. Although the law did not describe the emblem in words, it still appeared in the annex of the act that established the design of the passports. The emblem depicted a hammer within two ears of wheat. Although the law did not define it as the national emblem, the symbol took on the role of one, appearing hung on the wall during the first meeting of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; later that year. Additionally, the emblem was used other official documents, such as in . Variations emerged in the emblem&#x27;s design, sometimes a red circle was added behind a black hammer.


Several years later, a decree creating the seal of the GDR featuring an emblem designed by was enacted on 28 May 1953. This emblem showed a more detailed drawing of the two ears of wheat wrapped around by ribbons patterned on the German tricolour, with a hammer and a compass inside the wreath. The end of the wing of the compass faced the dexter heraldic side of the emblem. The colours of said emblem were not specified by the act, which only included a black and white image of the seal. The emblem shown on the seal once again was used as the &quot;de facto&quot; national emblem, being used in identity cards and appearing on stamps. Depictions of the emblem varied in the period after the law due to the lack of specification of the colours, sometimes reversing the orientation of the compass by making the end of the compass&#x27;s wing face the sinister side and adding a coloured circle behind the hammer and compass.

===Official adoption===

A formal national emblem for the German Democratic Republic was introduced by law on 26 September 1955. The national emblem was defined to be nearly identical to the emblem from the 1953 seal law. The national emblem law determined the colours of the emblem by adding a red circle behind the hammer and compass. The orientation of the compass was also fixed, making the end of the wing of the compass face the sinister side. This version of the national emblem remained in force for the rest of East Germany&#x27;s existence. A stylised version of the emblem with less detailed ears of wheat later emerged which was commonly used in printed materials.

The emblem was added to the national flag by law of 1 October 1959. This caused the display of the East German flag, and by extension the emblem to be essentially illegal in West Germany and West Berlin. From 4 November 1959 to 4 February 1970, West German police were obliged to remove the flag whenever it was displayed.

The period following the fall of the Socialist Unity Party from power saw suggestions to completely redesign the emblem in 1990. One popular proposal was an image of a smith remaking a sword to a plough along with the text &quot;&quot; (German for &quot;swords to ploughshares&quot;, from Isaiah 2:3–4), a well known symbol of peace. Changes to the emblem never occurred and the 1959 emblem was retained. On 31 May 1990, the newly elected Volkskammer decided, at a suggestion from the conservative German Social Union party, that all images of the national emblem on public buildings would be removed or covered. Use of the emblem became obsolete following the dissolution of the German Democratic Republic on 3 October 1990.

<text>Óscar Únzaga de la Vega (19 April 1916 – 19 April 1959) was a Bolivian political figure and rebel. Most significantly, he founded the Bolivian Socialist Falange (FSB) movement in 1937, and ran for President in the 1956 elections, when his party became the main opposition movement to the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR). 
In 1959 Únzaga was one of fifty who died during an attempted coup by the FSB, with government forces reporting that he killed himself. Supporters disputed the official version and stated that Únzaga had been assassinated. He is revered as a hero and martyr by some factions of well-to-do Bolivian political elites.

<text>Alexander Bell Patterson (April 22, 1911 – April 2, 1993) was a long-time Canadian member of Parliament (MP) and was briefly leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada.

He was the son of an Irish father and Scottish mother who immigrated to Canada in 1901. He grew up on the family&#x27;s farm until moving to Portage la Prairie to work in a grocery store. Later he attended the Salvation Army Leadership Training School in Toronto. In 1938, he married Charlotte Nice, a Salvation Army officer from Neepawa, Manitoba. They raised four children.

From 1935 until 1953, he led churches in Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. In 1953, while minister of the Church of the Nazarene in Abbotsford, British Columbia, he was elected to House of Commons of Canada in the 1953 election from the riding of Fraser Valley, British Columbia. He was defeated in the 1958 election. He ran for the party leadership at the 1961 Social Credit leadership convention but withdrew before the first ballot.

Patterson returned to Parliament in 1962. He became acting leader of the Social Credit Party in 1967 when leader Robert N. Thompson resigned citing the party&#x27;s lack of financial support from its BC and Alberta wings. Once the writs were dropped for the 1968 election, Thompson sought and won the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada nomination in his riding. Bud Olson had left the party a few months before joining the Liberal Party of Canada, leaving Patterson as the acting leader of the remaining three-person Social Credit caucus into the 1968 election in which all three MPs were defeated, including Patterson in Fraser Valley East.

Patterson returned to Parliament in the 1972 election representing Fraser Valley East as a Progressive Conservative, and was subsequently re-elected as a Tory until his retirement from politics in 1984.

<doc id="734730" wikidata="Q3642919" url="?curid=734730" title="Thomas Upington">
<text>Sir Thomas Upington (1844–1898), born in Cork, Ireland, was an administrator and politician of the Cape Colony.

He was briefly Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, between 1884 and 1886, during a period of extreme turbulence in the Cape&#x27;s history.

The town of Upington in the Northern Cape is named after him, as was the short-lived Boer republic of Upingtonia.

==Early life==

Upington was born in Rathnee, near Mallow, County Cork, on 28 October 1844. He was educated at Cloyne Diocesan School, Mallow, and at Trinity College Dublin, where in 1863 he obtained Mathematical Honours in the Hilary term examinations.

He was called to the Irish Bar in 1867. In 1868 he became secretary to Thomas O&#x27;Hagan, 1st Baron O&#x27;Hagan, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and in January 1870 he appeared as registrar to the court in Dr MacSwiney&#x27;s appeal to the Visitors of the King and Queen&#x27;s College of Physicians against his ejection from a fellowship.

==Political career (1878–1898)==

Upington emigrated to the Cape Colony in 1874, due to his fragile health, from which he suffered throughout his life.

He was elected to the Cape Legislature in 1878 and stood for several constituencies in turn; Colesberg (1878–83), Caledon (1884–91), and Swellendam (1896–98). Throughout his political career he was exceptionally close to his friend and ally John Gordon Sprigg, and served regularly as Attorney General in Sprigg&#x27;s governments (1878–81, 1886–90, 1896–98)

===First Service as Attorney General (1879–81)===

He was appointed Attorney General in 1879, by his ally, Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg.

During this time, he was active in the war on the Northern border, although in a civil capacity (he did not hold any military command). He was on &quot;the northern bank of the Orange River at the time of the last attack, only it was thought Claus Lucas would have surrendered, and in that case Mr Upington wished to superintend the negotiations himself&quot; (Irish Times, 6 June). He raised the military unit known as &quot;Upington&#x27;s Foot&quot; and served in the so-called &quot;9th Kaffir War, 1877–79&quot; for which he received the &quot;South Africa Medal 1877-9 (sometimes called the South Africa General Service Medal 1877-9 and sometimes the South Africa War Medal 1877-9). Upington&#x27;s Foot was one of the 240 (mostly small) locally raised units which took part. It had only 30 members and fought against the Gcalekas and Gaikas in the Transkei.

Sprigg&#x27;s government was unusually aggressive in its treatment of the Cape&#x27;s indigenous peoples. Upington, while differing from Sprigg on many points, was not immune to such issues.

The &quot;Koegas affair&quot; (1879–80) involved the murder of San people (Bushmen) by farmers, near the northern frontier. In the subsequent murder trial, the farmers were acquitted, and the resulting outrage focused on Upington, as Attorney General. He was accused of deliberately allowing the trial to take place in a racist and hostile town that would be expected to acquit the murderers due to local influence, and thereby of dereliction of the Attorney General&#x27;s duty. 
The culmination of the outrage was a public campaign, led by Saul Solomon, accusing Upington and his colleagues of allowing white juries to acquit white murderers from murdering blacks.

===Term as Prime Minister (1884–1886)===

He became the fourth Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in 1884, after the growing Afrikaner Bond Party compelled the government of Premier Thomas Charles Scanlen to retire. He was appointed to form a government by the powerful Afrikaner Bond, but held office for only two turbulent and strife-torn years, in what subsequently became known as the &quot;Warming-pan&quot; Ministry.

====Tensions between Boer and British====

The principal issue that dominated Upington&#x27;s short Ministry was the conflict over two tiny Boer mercenary states – Stellaland and Goshen – which had been established by Boer invaders in &quot;British&quot; Bechuanaland and which the British demanded were rejected. The issue placed Upington in a near impossible position as he owed his parliamentary support to the Afrikaner Bond which was strongly sympathetic of the Boer states, while the British Imperial authorities demanded his action.

In response, he travelled to Bechuanaland (with John Gordon Sprigg accompanying him as his Treasurer General) &quot;in the endeavour to effect a peaceful arrangement&quot;. The sympathy which he at times expressed for the Boers in this controversy helped to maintain his parliamentary support, but made him very controversial in the eyes of the Imperial authorities and the Cape political elite. He was accused of propounding Parnellite principles and denounced by British politicians in Cape Town as a “Fenian” whose &quot;offence is rank&quot;, and who &quot;has been fraternising with Mynheer Van Dunk instead of sticking with John Bull&quot;. Even in less hostile circles, he was nonetheless known as &quot;the Afrikaner from Cork&quot;.

====Domestic policies====

Regarding internal development of the country, Upington attempted to continue the highly successful locally oriented economic policies of his predecessors Molteno and Scanlen. In 1885, he oversaw the final opening of Molteno&#x27;s original railway line from Cape Town to Kimberley.

He attempted to reject the flamboyant imperialism of Sprigg (and subsequent ministers such as Rhodes and Jameson), however while trying to restrict British Imperial involvement in southern Africa, he nonetheless pushed for an expansion of the Cape&#x27;s frontiers into the territory of the neighbouring Xhosa. Some of his policies (such as reintroducing the infamous &quot;Contagious Diseases Acts&quot;) also brought him into conflict with the powerful liberal lobby, represented by Saul Solomon, which saw them as discriminatory against the black citizens and voters of the Cape.

====Downfall====

Overall, his Ministry was too short and circumscribed by greater regional forces for any consistent policies to take shape.

Attacked from all sides, his position rapidly became untenable. After coming under a fresh wave of attack over his Basutoland policy, he resigned &quot;due to ill-health&quot; in 1886, and handed over to his pro-imperialist ally John Gordon Sprigg.

==Character and later life==

In 1885, he became Lieutenant Colonel, commanding the 1st Administrative Battalion, made up of the Cape Town Highlanders and two small corps. Later in 1887, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (per South Africa, 17 December 1898, pp. 591–2).

He was famously eloquent and witty, and was often compared to his liberal enemy John X. Merriman – another distinctively thin politician at the time with a similarly ornate and witty style of speech. Though the two men opposed each other on nearly every point, they had very similar rapid-fire and flowery debating styles, that made their frequent arguments very entertaining to observe in parliament.

The Pall Mall Gazette, in 1890, described Upington as:

&quot;&quot;the crack speaker, brilliant and sarcastic . . . The clubland of Capetown looks to him as its humorous and sententious oracle: he is a good hand at cards and the best of good company. . . He often looks and often professes to be with one foot in the grave, and his most brilliant efforts are said to be made after a few weeks&#x27; light diet of champagne (doctor’s orders). His robustest friends, however, expect him to survive to crack jokes on their epitaphs&quot;.&quot;

However his lifelong health problems worsened, and on 10 December 1898, Upington died in Wynberg, Cape Town, aged only 54.

He was survived by his widow Mary Elizabeth Guerin of Edenhill, Mallow/Fermoy, Cork, and by his children: Beauclerk, Arthur, Edith, Florence and Evelyn.

<text>Richard Upjohn (22 January 1802 – 16 August 1878) was a British-American architect who emigrated to the United States and became most famous for his Gothic Revival churches. He was partially responsible for launching the movement to popularity in the United States. Upjohn also did extensive work in and helped to popularize the Italianate style. He was a founder and the first president of the American Institute of Architects. His son, Richard Michell Upjohn, (1828-1903), was also a well-known architect and served as a partner in his continued architectural firm in New York.

==Life and career==
Richard Upjohn was born in Shaftesbury, England, where he was apprenticed to a builder and cabinet-maker. He eventually became a master-mechanic. He and his family emigrated to the United States in 1829. They initially settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts and then moved on to Boston in 1833, where he worked in architectural design. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1836. His first major project was for the entrances to the Boston Common, the town&#x27;s central park and his first church would be St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Bangor, Maine. He had relocated to New York City by 1839, where he worked on alterations to the famed Trinity Church on Wall Street in Lower Manhattan. The alterations were later abandoned and he was commissioned to design a new church, completed in 1846, and still extant today. He published his extremely influential book, &quot;Upjohn&#x27;s rural architecture: Designs, working drawings and specifications for a wooden church, and other rural structures&quot;, in 1852. The designs in this publication were widely used across the country by builders, with many examples remaining.

Upjohn, along with 13 other architects, co-founded the American Institute of Architects on February 23, 1857. He served as president of that organization from 1857 to 1876, being succeeded by Thomas Ustick Walter, fourth Architect of the Capitol. He went on the design many buildings in a variety of styles. He died at his home in Garrison, New York in 1878. Architectural drawings and papers by Upjohn and other family members are held by the Drawings and Archives Department of the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, in New York City, also by the New York Public Library&#x27;s Humanities and Social Sciences Library, in the Manuscripts and Archives division, and by the Library of Congress, Prints &amp; Photographs Division on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

He died on 16 August 1878 in Putnam County, New York of cerebral softening.

<text>Emory Upton (August 27, 1839 – March 15, 1881) was a United States Army general and military strategist, prominent for his role in leading infantry to attack entrenched positions successfully at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House during the American Civil War, but he also excelled at artillery and cavalry assignments. His work, &quot;The Military Policy of the United States&quot;, which analyzed American military policies and practices and presented the first systematic examination of the nation&#x27;s military history, had a tremendous effect on the U.S. Army when it was published posthumously in 1904.

==Early life==
Upton was born on a farm near Batavia, New York, the tenth child and sixth son of Daniel and Electra Randall Upton. He would become the brother-in-law of Andrew J. Alexander and of Frank P. Blair Jr. He studied under famous evangelist Charles G. Finney at Oberlin College for two years before being admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856. While at West Point, Upton lost a duel against fellow Cadet Wade Hampton Gibbes of South Carolina. Gibbes made remarks to other cadets about Upton&#x27;s relationships with African-American girls at Oberlin College which prompted Upton to challenge Gibbes to a duel. The two men fought with swords in a darkened room of the cadet barracks. Upton suffered a deep cut on his face. He graduated eighth in his class of 45 cadets on May 6, 1861, just in time for the outbreak of the Civil War.

In 1868, Upton married Emily Norwood Martin, daughter of the philanthropist and social activist Cornelia Williams Martin, and she died of tuburculosis in 1870.

==Civil War==

Upton was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery, transferring to the 5th U.S. Artillery as a first lieutenant on May 14, assigned to Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell&#x27;s Army of Northeastern Virginia, as an aide-de-camp to Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler. In the First Battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861, he was wounded in the arm and left side during the action at Blackburn&#x27;s Ford, although he did not leave the field. He commanded his battery in the VI Corps Artillery Reserve through the 1862 Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. In the Maryland Campaign, including the battles at Crampton&#x27;s Gap at South Mountain and the Battle of Antietam, he commanded the artillery brigade for the 1st Division, VI Corps.

Upton was appointed colonel of the 121st New York on October 23, 1862. He led the regiment at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December and commanded the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, of the VI Corps, starting at the Battle of Gettysburg, to where the corps marched 35 miles in a single night from Manchester, Maryland, and was then kept in reserve. In the Bristoe Campaign, Upton was cited for gallant service at Rappahannock Station in November 1863 and was given a brevet promotion to major in the regular army.
In the 1864 Overland Campaign, Upton led his brigade in the Wilderness, but his greatest contribution was at Spotsylvania Court House, where he developed a new tactic to attack the Confederate breastworks, one that would foreshadow tactics used in the trench warfare of World War I. Upton devised a tactic wherein columns of massed infantry would swiftly assault a small part of the enemy line, without pausing to trade fire, and in doing so attempt to overwhelm the defenders and achieve a breakthrough. The standard infantry assault employed a wide battle line advancing more slowly, firing at the enemy as it moved forward. On May 10, 1864, Upton led twelve regiments in such an assault against the Confederate&#x27;s &quot;Mule Shoe&quot; salient. His tactics worked and his command penetrated to the center of the Mule Shoe, but they were left unsupported and forced to withdraw in the face of enemy artillery and mounting reinforcements. Upton was wounded but not severely in the attack, but was promoted to brigadier general to rank from May 12. On that same day, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock adapted Upton&#x27;s columnar assault tactic to the entire II Corps to break through the Mule Shoe. On June 1 Upton&#x27;s 2nd Brigade was engaged in the Battle of Cold Harbor where his units suffered some heavy losses. In late June 1864 he participated in the early stages of the Siege of Petersburg.

The VI Corps, of which Upton&#x27;s brigade was part, was detached from the Army of the Potomac and sent to deal with Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early&#x27;s threat to Washington and in the subsequent Valley Campaigns of 1864. At the Third Battle of Winchester, Upton assumed command of the 1st Division, VI Corps, when its commander fell mortally wounded. Upton himself was severely wounded in the thigh soon after, but refused to be removed from the field until the battle was over. He was carried on a stretcher for the duration of the battle, directing his troops. He received two brevet promotions for Winchester: colonel in the regular army (September 19, 1864) and major general of volunteers (October 19).

After returning from medical leave, Upton finished the war as a cavalry commander, completing his mastery of all three combat arms. Under the command of Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson, he led the 4th Division of the Cavalry Corps of the Military Division of the Mississippi. The division saw action during Wilson&#x27;s Raid and the Battle of Selma.

On April 16, 1865, the division made a night assault upon the Confederate works in the Battle of Columbus, Georgia, capturing a large amount of arms, ammunition, stores, and 1,500 prisoners, and burning the incomplete casemate ironclad, CSS &quot;Muscogee&quot;. This occurred a week after the surrender of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army in Virginia, and was the last large-scale engagement during the war. A few weeks later, in May 1865, Upton was ordered to arrest Alexander Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy, and a little later Jefferson Davis was placed in his custody. He was given a brevet promotion to brigadier general in the regular army for his actions at Selma and major general in the regular army, both on March 13, 1865.

Robert Hoffsommer wrote that, by the end of the war, the 25-year-old Upton &quot;had commanded outstandingly in all three branches of the army.&quot;

==Postbellum career and death==
After the war, Upton commanded a cavalry brigade in the Department of the Cumberland from July through September 1865 and served in the District of Colorado until April 1866. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on April 30, 1866. He was assigned to a board at West Point that considered a new system of infantry tactics, which was approved in 1867. In July 1866 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 25th U.S. Infantry and transferred to the 18th U.S. Infantry in March 1869. From 1870 to 1875 he was the commandant of cadets at the United States Military Academy, where he also taught infantry, artillery, and cavalry tactics. Upton was a member of the Society of the Army of the Potomac.

Impressed with the lessons of the Franco-Prussian War, U.S. Army Commanding General William T. Sherman sent Upton on a tour of Europe and Asia to study military organizations, but with a special emphasis on the German Army. Upon his return, Upton wrote &quot;The Armies of Europe and Asia&quot;, which warned that European armies had developed soldiering as a profession to a more advanced state than the U.S. Army. Upton presented 54 pages of recommendations for changes in the Army, including that it establish advanced military schools, a general staff, a system of personnel evaluation reports, and promotion by examination. The U.S. interest in French military organizations and tactics, which dominated fighting in the Civil War, went into decline. He was appointed superintendent of theoretical instruction at the Artillery School of Practice located at Fort Monroe, Virginia, where he emphasized combined arms tactics. His duties included teaching &quot;military art and science&quot; - geography, military history and law - introduced in 1875 by George W. Getty.

In 1881, Upton, having returned to the rank of colonel in 1880, was in command of 4th U.S. Artillery at the Presidio of San Francisco. He suffered greatly from headaches, possibly caused by a brain tumor, and died by suicide on March 15, 1881, by shooting himself in the head. He is buried in Fort Hill Cemetery, Auburn, New York.

==Army reform==
Upton is considered one of the most influential young reformers of the United States Army in the 19th century, and arguably in U.S. history. He has been called the U.S. Army&#x27;s counterpart to United States Navy reformer and strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. Although his books on tactics and on Asian and European armies were considered influential, his greatest impact was a work he called &quot;The Military Policy of the United States from 1775&quot;. He worked for years on the paper, and it was still incomplete at the time of his death in 1881.

&quot;Military Policy&quot; was a controversial work in which Upton outlined U.S. military history, arguing that the country’s armed forces were imprudent and weak and &quot;that all the defects of the American military system rested upon a fundamental, underlying flaw, excessive civilian control of the military.&quot; He denigrated the influence of the Secretary of War and promoted the idea that all military decisions in the field should be made by professional officers, although the president should retain the role of commander-in-chief. He argued for a strong, standing regular army that would be supplemented by volunteers or conscripts in time of war, a general staff system based on the Prussian model, examinations to determine promotions, compulsory retirement of officers who reach a certain age, advanced military education, and combat maneuvering by groups of four three-battalion infantry regiments. Upton&#x27;s work had a profound influence on discussions of military and civilian strategy for years. All of Upton&#x27;s proposed reforms would be implemented in the 1890s and early 1900s and laid the foundation for the high level of efficiency the U.S. Army demonstrated in World War I.

After Upton&#x27;s death, Henry A. du Pont, Upton&#x27;s West Point classmate and a close friend, acquired a copy of the uncompleted manuscript. It circulated widely throughout the Army&#x27;s officer corps and helped to foment much discussion. After the Spanish–American War, Secretary of War Elihu Root read the manuscript and ordered that the War Department publish it under the title &quot;The Military Policy of the United States&quot;. Many of the Army&#x27;s so-called Root Reforms of the early twentieth century were inspired by Upton and his works.

==Memorials==
In 1895, Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson wrote an introductory article for a book by (Peter Michie), &quot;The Life and Letters of Emory Upton&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s tribute to his former subordinate demonstrates the significance of Emory Upton&#x27;s accomplishments and characteristics:

Upton was commemorated at a site in central Suffolk County, New York, presently occupied by Brookhaven National Laboratory. The U.S. Army&#x27;s Camp Upton was active from 1917 until 1920, and again from 1940 until 1946. During World War II, the camp was rebuilt primarily as an induction center for draftees. The Army later used the site as a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital for returning wounded.

A statue of Upton stands before the Genesee County Courthouse in his native Batavia.

Reflecting a pattern of naming many Washington, D.C., streets in newly developed areas in the capital after Civil War generals, an east-west street in the Northwest quadrant is named Upton Street, NW.

<doc id="734742" wikidata="Q243047" url="?curid=734742" title="Agathe Uwilingiyimana">
<text>Agathe Uwilingiyimana (; 23 May 1953 – 7 April 1994), sometimes known as Madame Agathe, was a Rwandan political figure. She served as Prime Minister of Rwanda from 18 July 1993 until her assassination on 7 April 1994, during the opening stages of the Rwandan genocide. She was also Rwanda&#x27;s acting head of state in the hours leading up to her death.

She was Rwanda&#x27;s first and so far only female prime minister.

== Early life ==

Agathe Uwilingiyimana was born 23 May 1953 in the village of Nyaruhengeri in the southern Rwandan province Butare, southeast of the Rwandan capital Kigali. She moved with her farming parents to the Belgian Congo to find work, but they moved back to Butare in 1957. She was a member of the Hutu ethnicity that made up the majority of the Rwandan population.

After success in public examinations she was educated at Notre Dame des Cîteaux Secondary School, and obtained the certificate to teach humanities in 1973. She continued with graduate studies in mathematics and chemistry, after which she became a schoolteacher in Butare in 1976. By 1983 she was teaching chemistry at the National University of Rwanda in Butare. She received a B.Sc. in 1985, and taught chemistry for four years in Butare academic schools. She received criticism from traditionalists for promoting mathematics and science study amongst female students.

Uwilingiyimana married a high-school classmate, Ignace Barahira, in 1976; she kept her maiden name, as is customary for Rwandese women. She had the first of her five children the next year.

== Rise to prime minister ==
In 1986 she created a Soriority and Credit Cooperative Society among the staff of the Butare academic school, and her high-profile role in the self-help organization brought her to the attention of the Kigali authorities, who wanted to appoint decision makers from the discontented south of the country. In 1989 she became a director in the Ministry of Commerce.

She joined the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), an opposition party, in 1992, and that April was appointed Minister of Education by Dismas Nsengiyaremye, the first opposition prime minister under a power-sharing scheme negotiated between President Juvénal Habyarimana and five major opposition parties. As education minister, Uwilingiyamana scrapped the academic ethnic quota system, instead distributing public school spots and awards on the basis of open merit. This came in the midst of the Rwandan Civil War of 1990–94, and earned her the enmity of the Hutu extremists, as the quota system had favoured Hutus.

Uwilingiyimana succeeded Nsengiyaremye as Rwanda&#x27;s prime minister on July 17, 1993, following a meeting between President Habyarimana and the five parties. The party was divided between moderates and extremists, and she was a moderate. Nsengiyaremye and the MDR convened an extraordinary congress in Kabusunzu on 23–24 July, during which hardliners had her resign from the party, together with the president of MDR, Faustin Twagiramungu.

Uwilingiyimana briefly resigned in view of her lack of support, but a group of prominent personalities, including Twagiramungu and Théoneste Bagosora, made her renounce her resignation. The MDR was thus split into two factions each claiming to be the real MDR. At a meeting in Kigali, Habyarimana addressed her condescendingly as &quot;You, woman!&quot;, to which she replied &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me like that. I&#x27;m not your wife!&quot;

== Arusha Accords ==

The Habyarimana–Uwilingiyimana government had the daunting task of successfully completing the Arusha Accords with the rebel Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF), the Tutsi-dominated guerilla movement. An agreement between Habyarimana, the five opposition parties (led ostensibly by Uwilingiyimana), and the RPF, was finally reached on 4 August 1993. Under Arusha Accords, Habyarimana&#x27;s ruling MRND would take the transitional presidency, and the Prime Minister would be Faustin Twagiramungu from the MDR.

== Caretaker prime minister ==
President Habyarimana officially dismissed her as prime minister on 4 August 1993, but she stayed on in a caretaker capacity for eight months, until her death in April 1994. This was despite being excoriated by all the Hutu-dominated parties, including her own MDR, and President Habyarimana&#x27;s ruling party, which held a press conference in January 1994 attacking Uwilingiyimana for being a &quot;political trickster&quot;. On November 3, 1993, she publicly warned against retaliatory violence against Tutsis for the assassination of the Hutu Burundian President, Melchior Ndadaye, and said that violence was being used to disrupt the Arusha transition.

The swearing in of the Broad Based Transitional Government (BBTG), was to have taken place on 25 March 1994. At that point, Uwilingiyimana was to have stepped down in favor of Faustin Twagiramungu, having been guaranteed a lower-level ministerial post in the new government. However, the RPF did not appear at the ceremony, postponing the establishment of the new regime. She reached agreement with them that the new government would be sworn in on the following day.

== Death ==

The talks between President Habyarimana, Uwilingiyimana, and the Rwandan Patriotic Front were never concluded, and the president&#x27;s plane was shot down by surface-to-air missiles at around 8:30 pm on 6 April 1994. From Habyarimana&#x27;s death until her assassination the following morning (approximately 14 hours), Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana was Rwanda&#x27;s constitutional head of state and of government.

In an interview with Radio France on the night of President Habyarimana&#x27;s assassination, Uwilingiyimana said that there would be an immediate investigation. She said her home was under siege, and gave her last recorded words:

There is shooting, people are being terrorized, people are inside their homes lying on the floor. We are suffering the consequences of the death of the head of state, I believe. We, the civilians, are in no way responsible for the death of our head of state.

The U.N. peacekeeping force sent an escort of ten Belgian peacekeepers to her home before 3 am the following morning; they intended to take her to Radio Rwanda, from where she planned to make a dawn broadcast appealing for national calm. Uwilingiyimana&#x27;s house was further guarded by five Ghanaian U.N. troops, who were stationed outside. Inside the house, the family was protected by the Rwandan presidential guard, but between 6:55 and 7:15 am the presidential guard surrounded the U.N. troops and told them to lay down their arms. Fatally, the blue berets ultimately complied, handing over their weapons just before 9 am.

Seeing the stand-off outside her home, Uwilingiyimana and her family took refuge in the Kigali U.N. volunteer compound around 8 am. Eyewitnesses to the inquiry on U.N. actions say that Rwandan soldiers entered the compound at 10 am and searched it for Uwilingiyimana. Fearing for the lives of her children, Uwilingiyimana and her husband emerged. The presidential guard killed them both on the morning of 7 April 1994; Uwilingiyimana had been shot point-blank. Her children escaped and eventually took refuge in Switzerland. In his book &quot;Me Against My Brother&quot;, Scott Peterson writes that the U.N. troops sent to protect Uwilingiyimana were castrated, gagged with their own genitalia, and then murdered. However, page 44 and 45 of the UNKIBAT-01 Tab 241 of the Prosecution Case File of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, states: &quot;Although the bodies show signs of fighting, some have rifle-butt or bayonet injuries, some show signs of having been struck by machetes or bullet wounds, there are no traces of sadistic mutilations.&quot;

In his book &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, U.N. commander Roméo Dallaire writes that Uwilingiyimana and her husband surrendered themselves to save their children, who stayed hidden in the adjoining housing compound for employees of the United Nations Development Programme. The children survived and were picked up by Captain Mbaye Diagne, a UNAMIR military observer, who smuggled them into the Hôtel des Mille Collines. They were eventually resettled in Switzerland.

Major Bernard Ntuyahaga was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) for the murder of Uwilingiyimana and the U.N. peacekeepers, but the charges were dropped. He was eventually convicted of murder of the peacekeepers. On 18 December 2008, the ICTR found Colonel Théoneste Bagosora guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and sentenced him to life imprisonment, in part due to his involvement in the murders of Uwilingiyimana and the Belgian peacekeepers.

== Legacy ==

Uwilingiyimana is remembered as a pioneer in women&#x27;s rights and education in Rwanda, and her efforts to reconcile ethnic differences in the country. Though short, her political career was precedent-setting as one of the few female political figures in Africa. She was contemporaneous with Sylvie Kinigi, Prime Minister of Burundi. As a memorial to the late Rwandan Prime Minister, the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) established &quot;The Agathe Innovative Award Competition&quot;. The award funds educational and income generating projects aimed at improving the prospects of African girls. One of FAWE&#x27;s founding members was Agathe Uwilingiyimana.

Uwilingiyimana was succeeded as prime minister of the interim government by Jean Kambanda, a Hutu hardliner.

<text>Cassam Uteem, GCSK (born 22 March 1941, Port Louis) is a Mauritian political figure who served as the second president of Mauritius from 30 June 1992 to 15 February 2002. He is the longest serving president of Mauritius.

==Early life and education==
Cassam Uteem attended the secondary school Royal College Port Louis. Then he travelled to France and studied at Paris VII University and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Art and a master&#x27;s degree in Psychology. He also holds a Certificate in Social Work from the University of Mauritius and a &quot;Diplôme d’État Français d’Assistant des services sociaux&quot;.

==Ancestry and family life==
In the 1800s Cassam Uteem&#x27;s ancestors migrated from the historic city of Azamgarh&#x27;s Village Dubawan, Uttar Pradesh in India. 

He married Zohra Jahangeer and they have 3 children: Reza Uteem, Dilshaad Uteem and Oomar Uteem. However, Oomar Uteem died in 2007. They also have 10 grandchildren.

==Political career==
In the 1960s, Cassam Uteem was a youth leader and social worker who was actively involved in the local community during colonial times that preceded the 1968 Independence of Mauritius. He became a leading member of leftist political party the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM). In 1969 he was elected Councillor of the City of Port Louis at the Municipal Elections, a position in which he remained for several years before becoming city&#x27;s Lord Mayor in 1986.

Cassam Uteem was elected a member of the Mauritian Legislative Assembly in 1976. He was re-elected as a member of Parliament in 1982, 1983, 1987 and 1991. In 1982 and 1983, he held the portfolio of Minister of Employment, Social Security and National Solidarity. In 1990, he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Industrial Technology. When he formed part of the Opposition in Parliament he was &quot;Opposition Whip&quot; and Chairman of the &quot;Public Accounts Committee.&quot;

Following the establishment of a republic on 12 March 1992, the last Governor-General, Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo, became the first President. However, this was under an interim arrangement, and Cassam Uteem was nominated to serve as President for a five-year term with effect from 30 June of that year.

On 15 February 2002, he resigned from office, after refusing to sign a controversial anti-terrorism bill, namely PoTA, into the constitution. His term would have ended in June 2002. He was replaced as president by Angidi Chettiar.

On 10 November 2014, Mr. Uteem was appointed United Nations Secretary-General&#x27;s Special Envoy and Head of the United Nations Electoral Observation Mission in Burundi.

In November 2014, Uteem was elected President of International Movement ATD Fourth World.

Uteem was a candidate for the position of Chairperson of the African Union Commission in early 2008, but withdrew prior to the vote.

Cassam Uteem is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

Uteem appeared in the John Pilger documentary &quot;Stealing a Nation&quot;, which is about the Chagos Archipelago sovereignty dispute.

==Awards and decorations==
** Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean (1993)

<doc id="734747" wikidata="Q3108592" url="?curid=734747" title="Liuqin">
<text>The liuqin (Chinese: ,  ) is a three, four or five-stringed Chinese mandolin with a pear-shaped body. The range of its voice is much higher than other Chinese plucked string instrument, and it is used in both orchestral music and solo pieces in Chinese music. This has been the result of a modernization in its usage in recent years, leading to a gradual elevation in status of the &quot;liuqin&quot; from an accompaniment instrument in folk Chinese opera, to an instrument known for its unique tonal and acoustic qualities. The instrument is held diagonally like the Chinese ruan and yueqin. Its strings are elevated by a bridge and the soundboard has two prominent soundholes. Finally, the instrument is played with a pick with similar technique to both ruan and yueqin. Therefore, the liuqin is most commonly played and doubled by those with ruan and yueqin experience.

Historically, the &quot;liuqin&quot; was commonly made of willow wood (柳 &quot;liǔ&quot; literally meaning &quot;willow&quot;), while professional players used versions constructed with a higher-quality red sandalwood or rosewood. In contemporary versions, however, the front board is made of &quot;tong&quot; wood (桐木) and red sandalwood is used for the back.

==History==
The &quot;liuqin&quot; has gone by various names, firstly the liuyeqin (), meaning willow leaf-shaped instrument. This was the original term for the &quot;liuqin&quot;, which is an abbreviation of the term &quot;liuyeqin&quot;. The other reference to the &quot;liuqin&quot; is the tu pipa (土琵琶), literally meaning unrefined &quot;pipa&quot;, because of the diminutive size and resemblance of the &quot;liuqin&quot; to the &quot;pipa&quot;.

Throughout its history, the &quot;liuqin&quot; came in variations ranging from two (which only had a range of one and a half octaves) to four strings. However, the earliest precursor of the modern four-stringed version of the instrument appeared and experienced popularity during the Qing Dynasty. This version had two strings, and was only used for accompaniment purposes in traditional operas.

The two-stringed &quot;liuqin&quot; remained in use for much of dynastic China from the Qing Dynasty until the late 20th century. With the modernization of traditional Chinese music in the 1970s, the four-stringed &quot;liuqin&quot; was developed as an improvement to its musical range, and the body of the instrument was enlarged to allow players to handle the instrument with greater ease.

==Playing technique, tones and range==
The playing technique is similar to that of the mandolin, using a plectrum and frequently using the tremolo technique. Its strings are either tuned in fifths, G-D-A-E (as a mandolin or violin), or else in a mixture of fourths and fifths, as for example G-D-G-D, which is the more common tuning employed by mainstream players of the &quot;liuqin&quot;. This makes playing of the &quot;liuqin&quot; exactly the same as the &quot;zhongruan&quot;, which is tuned an octave lower, hence players of either the &quot;liuqin&quot; or the &quot;ruan&quot; can often double on both instruments.

Liuqin has a refreshing, jubilant and delicate tonal quality.

The modern &quot;liuqin&quot; has four steel strings. Like the &quot;ruan&quot;, the number of the &quot;liuqin&quot;&#x27;s frets was increased from 7 to 29 over the course of the 20th century. These frets are arranged in half-step intervals. As the frets on all Chinese lutes are high, the fingers do not touch the instruments&#x27; bodies—distinctively different from western fretted instruments. This allows for a greater control over timbre and intonation than their western counterparts, but makes chordal playing (double, triple, quadruple stopping) more difficult.

<text>John Palmer Usher (January 9, 1816 – April 13, 1889) was an American administrator who served in the Cabinet of President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.

==Life and career==
Born in Brookfield, New York, Usher trekked west in 1839 to locate in Terre Haute in western Indiana where he became a law partner with William D. Griswold in the firm of Griswold &amp; Usher. An outstanding trial lawyer, Usher traveled the circuit in Indiana and Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s, becoming acquainted with Abraham Lincoln of Springfield, Illinois. He also became a mentor to young Joseph Gurney Cannon.

In 1850, Usher was elected to serve in the Indiana General Assembly. After the resignation of James G. Jones, Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed Usher to the office of Indiana Attorney General. While Usher was serving as Attorney General in March 1862, Lincoln asked him to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Interior. Then-secretary Caleb Blood Smith had little interest in the job, and, with declining health, soon delegated most of his responsibilities to Usher. When Smith resigned in December 1862, Usher became Secretary effective January 1, 1863.

Usher served as the Secretary of the Interior between 1863 and 1865. He was known as genial, courteous, and unobtrusive secretary. He accompanied Lincoln to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in November 1863 for the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery and sat on the platform with other dignitaries when Lincoln gave his famous Gettysburg Address. When William P. Fessenden resigned as Secretary of the Treasury in March 1865, Lincoln nominated Hugh McCulloch from Indiana to replace Fessenden at Treasury. 

Lincoln did not want two men from Indiana in his cabinet. Usher dated his resignation March 8, 1865 with an effective date of May 15. His resignation was accepted by Lincoln on March 9 and Usher continued to serve until May 15, a month after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. Lincoln had nominated his close friend James Harlan to replace Usher. Harlan had been confirmed by the Senate and took over as Secretary of Interior under now President Andrew Johnson.

Usher became general solicitor for the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division, and was active in promoting the construction of the railroad west from Kansas City. Later called the Kansas Pacific, the road was eventually consolidated with the Union Pacific in 1880.

Usher built a house in Lawrence, Kansas, completing it in 1873. Usher served one term as mayor of Lawrence. His house still stands at 1425 Tennessee Street and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It has been the home of the Alpha Nu chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity at the University of Kansas since 1912.

Usher died of cancer at the age of 73. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Lawrence.

==Portrayal==

Usher is portrayed by Dakin Matthews in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln&quot;.

<doc id="734763" wikidata="Q877239" url="?curid=734763" title="Yangqin">
<text>The trapezoidal yangqin () is a Chinese hammered dulcimer, likely derived from the Iranian santur or the European dulcimer. It used to be written with the characters (lit. &quot;foreign zither&quot;), but over time the first character changed to (also pronounced &quot;yáng&quot;), which means &quot;acclaimed&quot;. It is also spelled yang ch&#x27;in. Hammered dulcimers of various types are now very popular not only in China, but also Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India, Iran, and Pakistan. The instruments are also sometimes known by the names &quot;santoor&quot; and &quot;cymbalom&quot;. This instrument had an influence on the Thai classical instrument, known as Khim (ขิม).

The yangqin was traditionally fitted with bronze strings (though older Chinese stringed instruments used silk strings, resulting in their, and the yangqin&#x27;s, categorisation as a silk, or &quot;si&quot; instrument), which gave the instrument a soft timbre. This form of instrument is still occasionally heard today in the &quot;hudie qin&quot; (蝴蝶琴, lit. &quot;butterfly zither&quot;) played in the traditional silk and bamboo genre from the Shanghai region known as Jiangnan sizhu (江南絲竹), as well as in some Cantonese music and Chaozhou (Teochew) music groups. The Thai and Cambodian &quot;khim&quot; are nearly identical in their construction, having been introduced to those nations by southern Chinese musicians. Since the 1950s, however, steel alloy strings (in conjunction with copper-wound steel strings for the bass notes) have been used, in order to give the instrument a brighter, and louder tone. The modern yangqin can have as many as five courses of bridges and may be arranged chromatically. Traditional instruments, with three or more courses of bridges, are also still widely in use. The instrument&#x27;s strings are struck with two lightweight bamboo beaters (also known as hammers) with rubber tips. A professional musician often carries several sets of beaters, each of which draws a slightly different tone from the instrument, much like the drum sticks of Western percussionists. The yangqin is used both as a solo instrument and in ensembles.

==Origins==

Historians offer several theories to explain how the instrument was introduced to China:
#that the instrument may have been introduced by land, through the Silk Road;
#that it was introduced by sea, through the port of Guangzhou (Canton); or
#that it was invented without foreign influence by the Chinese themselves.

The word &quot;yangqin&quot; has historically been written in two different ways, using different Chinese characters for &quot;yang&quot;. The &quot;yang&quot; in the earlier version was written with the character , meaning &quot;foreign&quot;. It was later changed, in 1910, to the character &quot;yang&quot; (), meaning &quot;acclaimed&quot;.

===Theory of introduction by land===
Another theory of how the yangqin came into contact with the Chinese is through the Silk Road from Mongolia. At a glance, the Silk Route stretches almost 5,000 miles reaching from China to the Middle East, including Iran (Persia). The Iranian santur, a dulcimer, has existed since ancient times. If any dulcimer was to influence China by land, it is likely to be this instrument.

The technical structure of the santur is different in the way the tuning pegs are place, the bridges and the mallets. The yangqin&#x27;s tuning pins are set in parallel instead of a 90-degree angle down at the side. The mallets of the santur also differ from those of the yangqin – they are made of wood with finger grip, designed to let the players perform by gripping the two mallets between their fore and middle fingers. Both modern and earlier yangqin mallets did not include finger grips.

The bridge of the yangqin consist of long, single pieces of wood with many protruding &quot;stubs&quot; supporting the strings unlike the santur, which uses a number of small, individual chesspiece-like bridges.

===Theory of introduction by sea===
The port at Canton/Guangzhou attracts traders from all over Asia: from Japan, India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The ships from this region bought back precious stones, slaves, exotic wares, fruits, spices, etc. Along with trade, businesses, ideas, philosophies and scientific knowledge were exchanged, including religion (principally Buddhism).

During the 16th century, the Age of Exploration in Europe reached its climax and soon trade was established between China and Europe. Historians state that Portuguese, and later, English and Dutch ships, had brisk trade with China. Portuguese trading in Chinese waters began in the 16th century according to historians. Music historians report that the salterio, a hammered dulcimer, was played in Portugal, Spain, and Italy during this period. Historians say it is possible that the yangqin originated when the Portuguese, the English or the Dutch brought a dulcimer player to China who performed for locals.

==Construction==
As the &quot;yangqin&quot; is a type of hammered dulcimer, it shares many elements of construction with other instruments in the hammered dulcimer family:

===Strings===
Modern &quot;yangqin&quot; usually have 144 strings in total, with each pitch running in courses, with up to 5 strings per course, in order to boost the volume. The strings come in various thicknesses, and are tied at one end by screws, and at the other with tuning pegs. The pegs and screws are covered during playing by a hinged panel/board. This panel is opened up during tuning to access the tuning pegs.

===Bridges===
There are usually four to five bridges on a &quot;yangqin&quot;. From right to left, they are: bass bridge, &quot;right bridge&quot;, tenor bridge, &quot;left bridge&quot;, and the chromatic bridge. During playing, one is supposed to strike the strings on the left side of the bridges. However, the strings on the &quot;chromatic bridge&quot; are struck on the right, and strings on the &quot;left bridge&quot; can be struck on both sides of the bridge.

===Hammers===


The hammers are made of flexible bamboo, and one end is half covered by rubber. Due to their unique construction, there are two ways to play: with the rubber side for a softer sound, and with the bamboo side for a crisper, more percussive sound. This technique, known as 反竹 (fǎnzhǔ), is best utilized in the higher ranges of the yangqin. Additionally, the ends of the sticks can be used to pluck the strings, producing a stinging, precise sound. &quot;Glissandos&quot; can also be achieved in this way by running the ends of the sticks up or down the strings.

Furthermore, some songs require the use of &quot;雙音琴竹&quot; (shuāng yīn qín zhǔ), literally &quot;double-note yangqin hammers&quot;. These specially-constructed hammers have 2 striking surfaces, allowing the player to play up to 4 notes simultaneously (or even 8 notes, if the strings of the &quot;left bridge&quot; and &quot;tenor bridge&quot; are struck at a point where they intersect each other), resulting in a rich, powerful tone, which is especially pronounced in the lower registers due to the strings&#x27; long echoes. 林沖夜奔 (Lin Chong Flees In The Night), composed by 項祖華 (Xiang Zu Hua), is a representative solo piece which utilizes 雙音琴竹.

When using 雙音琴竹, the left hand holds a beater that plays intervals of a perfect fourth, while the right hand&#x27;s beater plays thirds. These intervals are standard over most of the yangqin&#x27;s range, due to the positioning of its strings.

===Cylindrical nuts===
On both sides of the yangqin, aside from the tuning screws, are numerous cylindrical metal Nuts that can be moved for fine tuning the strings or to raise the strings slightly to eliminate unwanted vibrations that may occur. More modern designs also have moveable ball-shaped nuts that can be adjusted on the fly with the fingers; this provides some microtuning and additional dynamics during performances, such as&quot; portamentos&quot; and &quot;vibratos&quot; (see below: &quot;Manner of Performance&quot;).

==Manner of performance==

The sticks are held, one in each hand, and hit the strings alternately. In the orchestra, the yangqin often adds to the harmony by playing chords or arpeggios. As the yangqin is softer than other Chinese instruments, it is usually positioned at the front of the orchestra, in the row just in front of the conductor. However, this is not a rule: the Singapore Chinese Orchestra positions the yangqin close to the percussion section. As the yangqin&#x27;s tones sustain long after they have been played, such an arrangement minimizes the dissonance that results. If the hands are free (e.g. in periods of rest), covering the strings with the hands quickly dampens the vibrations. The yangqin has been called the &quot;Chinese piano&quot; as it has an indispensable role in the accompaniment of Chinese string and wind instruments.

The yangqin&#x27;s solo repertoire calls for more techniques than is usually required in orchestral pieces. Examples include pressing down on the strings to produce &quot;vibrato&quot; effects, similar to that of a guzheng, as well as harmonics and 顫竹 (chàn zhǔ), which involves flicking the sticks lightly over the strings, causing them to vibrate, which results in a short, quick &quot;tremolo.&quot; Numerous other techniques, such as &quot;portamento&quot; – a glide from one note to another (accomplished through 2 methods, both involving the lengthening or shortening of strings: the first is by sliding the fine-tuning devices on the sides of the instrument by hand, and the second is by wearing a metallic &quot;ring&quot; – known as a 滑音指套 [huá yīn zhǐ tào] – and sliding it along the length of the indicated string) – are also used.

==Arrangement of pitches==
The &quot;yangqin&quot; is a chromatic instrument with a range of slightly over four octaves. Middle C is located on the tenor bridge, third course from the bottom.

The pitches are arranged so that in general, moving one section away from the player&#x27;s body corresponds to a transposition of a whole tone upwards. Similarly, moving one section towards the left of the performer generally corresponds to a transposition of a perfect fifth upwards. These are only rules of thumb since the arrangement has to be modified towards the extremes of the pitch range to fill out notes in the chromatic scale. Such an arrangement facilitates transposition.

In the playing of traditional Chinese music, most Chinese &quot;yangqin&quot; players use a numerical notation system called &quot;jianpu&quot;, rather than Western staff notation.

<doc id="734766" wikidata="Q456483" url="?curid=734766" title="William Usery Jr.">
<text>William Julian Usery Jr. ( ; December 21, 1923 – December 10, 2016) was an American labor union activist and government appointee who served as United States secretary of labor in the Ford administration.

Although Willie was his birth name, official sources often mistakenly called him &quot;William.&quot; For much of his life, Usery was known as &quot;W.J.,&quot; although most associates called him &quot;Bill.&quot;

==Early life and military service==
Usery was born on December 21, 1923, in Hardwick, Georgia, the son of Willie J. Usery and Effie Mae Williamson (later Phillips). He attended Georgia Military College from 1938 to 1941. From 1941 to 1942, he worked as an underwater welder for the J. A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick, Georgia, building Liberty ships. Usery married Gussie Mae Smith in 1942.

With the need for naval welders growing dramatically during World War II, Usery enlisted in the United States Navy. From 1943 to 1946, Usery worked on a U.S. Navy repair ship in the Pacific.

Following World War II, Usery worked as a steamfitter, welder, and machinist in Georgia. He attended Mercer University, but did not graduate.

==Career==
On March 1, 1952, while working as a machinist at the Armstrong Cork Company, Usery helped co-found Local Lodge 8 (now Local Lodge 918) of the International Association of Machinists (IAM), AFL-CIO. Over the years, he was elected to a series of offices within Local Lodge 8, eventually becoming president of the local union.

While working at Armstrong Cork, Usery served as the IAM&#x27;s special representative at the U.S. Air Force Cape Canaveral Air Force Missile Test Center (AFMTC).

In 1956, Usery retired from his job at Armstrong Cork after being elected a Grand Lodge Representative for the IAM. In this capacity, in 1961 Usery became the union representative on the President&#x27;s Missile Sites Labor Commission. Usery was responsible for leading labor negotiations and helping to administer and service union contracts at Cape Canaveral AFMTC, John F. Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center Manned Spacecraft Center. In 1967, Usery was designated by IAM to a labor-management council at Kennedy Space Center. He became the council&#x27;s chair in 1968.

===Assistant Secretary of Labor===
In February 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Usery to be Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations in the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). Usery oversaw the implementation and enforcement of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.

Usery helped write and implement Executive Order 11491 (October 29, 1969, which gave union organizing rights to two million federal government workers and established collective bargaining, grievance and dispute resolution procedures. The executive order had been long-sought by the American labor movement, and brought federal collective bargaining practices in line with those already in use in private industry.

During his tenure at DOL, Usery was instrumental in averting several large strikes. In April 1969, Usery helped avert a nationwide strike by the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen through round-the-clock, non-stop negotiations. He helped resolve collective bargaining disputes between the railways and the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks and the United Transportation Union.

Other strikes could not be avoided. Usery was part of a DOL team which was unable to avoid a national postal service strike. The illegal strike by more than 210,000 United States Postal Service workers began on March 18, 1970, in New York City. Nixon appeared on national television and ordered the employees back to work, but his address only stiffened the resolve of the existing strikers and angered workers in other 671 locations in other cities into walking out as well. Workers in other government agencies also announced they would strike as well if Nixon pursued legal action against the postal employees. The strike crippled the nation&#x27;s mail system, disrupting delivery of pension and welfare checks, tax refunds, census forms, and draft notices. Businesses hired planes and trucks to deliver publications or letters. Nixon spoke to the nation again on March 25 and ordered a 24,000 Army, Army National Guard, Army Reserve, Air National Guard, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve forces to begin distributing the mail. But the military proved ineffective at distributing the mail.

Negotiations, in which Usery played a key role, resolved the postal strike in just two weeks. Postal unions, Nixon administration officials and Congressional aides not only negotiated a contract which gave the unions most of what they wanted, but which also established a legislative framework which led to the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Under the act, postal unions won the right to negotiate on wages, benefits and working conditions. On July 1, 1971, five federal postal unions merged to form the American Postal Workers Union, the largest postal workers union in the world.

Although influential in the Nixon administration, Usery was unable to persuade the president to refrain from temporarily suspending the Davis-Bacon Act in 1971. The act set wages for construction workers on projects receiving federal funds. But the Vietnam War was putting significant inflationary pressure on construction wages. Although Nixon suspended Davis-Bacon, Usery and others soon convinced Nixon to reinstate Davis-Bacon enforcement and establish a separate body to review union contracts. Within a year, the new committee had identified a number of wage increases it had deemed extravagant, and won renegotiation of the agreements. Soon, wage increases on Davis-Bacon projects dropped from 14 percent to 6 percent.

===FMCS tenure===
In March 1973, Nixon appointed Usery to be director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), a federal agency which offered arbitration and mediation services to employers and labor unions.

On October 17, 1973, the AFL-CIO executive council unanimously asked Usery to become director of the federation&#x27;s Department of Organization and Field Services. Usery accepted the offer. But when Usery told Nixon about his decision, Nixon asked Usery to reconsider. Usery subsequently declined the AFL-CIO&#x27;s offer.

In part to reward Usery for his loyalty and as a sign of respect for Usery&#x27;s mediation and negotiation skills, Nixon appointed Usery to be Special Assistant to the President for Labor-Management Affairs in January 1974. In this capacity, Usery advised the president on labor-management relations in the federal government and private sector, and became the presidential point-man in labor disputes which might have a significant impact on the national economy. The appointment lapsed after Nixon&#x27;s resignation in August, but Gerald Ford re-appointed him to the position in January 1975. He continued as director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service until appointed by Ford to be Secretary of Labor in February 1976.

===Secretary of Labor===
On February 10, 1976, President Gerald Ford nominated Usery to be United States secretary of labor.

Usery&#x27;s tenure as secretary of labor, however, was limited. Ford lost the presidential election in November 1976. Incoming president Jimmy Carter declined to keep Usery on as secretary, installing F. Ray Marshall instead. Usery left office on January 20, 1977.

===Later career===
After leaving public service, Usery founded Bill Usery Associates, Inc., a labor relations consulting firm.

In 1983, Usery Associates was involved in automobile manufacturing industry negotiations between the United Auto Workers (UAW), General Motors (GM) and Toyota Motor. Usery assisted the UAW, GM and Toyota in crafting a contract which established a new, jointly-owned and -operated corporation, the New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI implemented Toyota&#x27;s &quot;lean&quot; production system in the U.S., but utilized a closed plant owned by GM. The UAW agreed to support the joint venture if NUMMI agreed to recognize the union at the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California. The UAW&#x27;s support was crucial in winning an anti-trust exemption from the Federal Trade Commission. Usery was able to get GM, Toyota and the UAW to agree to a first-of-its-kind labor-management partnership: The UAW agreed to Toyota&#x27;s production methods and Toyota agreed to make the UAW an equal partner in managing the plant&#x27;s productivity and quality control procedures. The NUMMI collective bargaining agreement was signed in June 1985. The labor-management partnership has won a number of labor-management, productivity, quality and good corporate citizenship awards.

Also in 1983, Usery mediated an education workers&#x27; strike in Chicago which involved 38,000 teachers and paraprofessionals.

In 1985, Usery founded and financed the Bill Usery Labor Relations Foundation. The foundation assists and advises democratic unions and employers in Russia on how to improve and professionalize labor-management relations.

In addition to his consulting work, Usery served on several federal labor-management commissions. One of these was the &quot;Coal Commission.&quot; In the 1980s, the United Mine Workers (UMWA) and coal mining companies began to dispute who was responsible for paying medical benefits to retired miners. The issue came to a head in 1989. The Pittston Coal Company (now part of The Brink&#x27;s Company) refused to make its monetary contribution to the mineworkers&#x27; retiree medical benefits fund. UMWA struck the company. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole asked Usery to mediate the dispute. Usery won both parties&#x27; agreement to form an Advisory Commission on United Mine Workers of America Retiree Health Benefits (the &quot;Coal Commission&quot;). The investigative body, which included Usery as co-commissioner, made regulatory and legislative recommendations to resolve the retiree health benefit issue. The Coal Commission&#x27;s recommendations were enacted in the Coal Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486).

From 1993 to 1995, Usery also served the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations (the &quot;Dunlop Commission&quot;).

In 1994, President Bill Clinton appointed Usery to mediate a major league baseball strike. In 1997, Georgia State University established the W.J. Usery Jr. Center for the Workplace. The center provides for the study of cooperative labor-management relations and serves as a resource for employers and workers seeking assistance in resolving disputes. In 2000, Usery began devoting most of his time to the work of the center. The W.J. Usery Jr. Center for the Workplace closed in early 2010.

==Memberships and awards==
In May 1975, he received an honorary doctorate in social science from the University of Louisville.

Usery was a member of the Labor and Employment Relations Association. In 1999, he received LERA&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2004, the board of regents of Georgia State University approved the establishment of the W.J. Usery Jr. Chair of the American Workplace at Georgia State University.

In 2010, a new building on the Georgia Military College campus in Milledgeville, Georgia, was named &quot;Usery Hall&quot; after a generous donation made to the school to help fund the project. The $22 million school building serves as an educational hall to the middle school and high school cadets.

== Personal life ==
He died on December 10, 2016, eleven days away from his 93rd birthday.

<text>Petrus or Pieter van der Aa (1530 – 1594), also called Vanderanus, was a Brabantine jurist.

==Biography==
Petrus van der Aa was born in Leuven. His father, Johan van der Aa, was a descendant of a well-known Brabantine family of patricians, which had settled in Leuven, Mechelen and Antwerp.

While his biographers disagree on some events in his life, it is considered that Petrus studied in Leuven and achieved his &quot;Doctor iuris utriusque&quot; in 1559. Three years later he was given a professorship in the same town, when his predecessor, Johannes Tack, moved to Douai in France.

In 1565 or 1569 he became a member of the Sovereign Council of Duchy of Brabant. In 1574, he became president of the Higher Regional Court of Luxembourg and Chiny. He continued in this office until his death in 1594. Petrus van der Aa acquired the title &quot;eques auratus (Knight of the Golden Spur)&quot; on 30 October 1583.

<doc id="734778" wikidata="Q449356" url="?curid=734778" title="Manuel Urrutia Lleó">
<text>Manuel Urrutia Lleó (December 8, 1901 – 5 July 1981) was a liberal Cuban lawyer and politician. He campaigned against the Gerardo Machado government and the dictatorial second presidency of Fulgencio Batista during the 1950s, before serving as president in the revolutionary government of 1959. Urrutia resigned his position after only seven months, owing to a series of disputes with revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, and emigrated to the United States shortly afterward.

==Before the presidency==
Born in Yaguajay, Las Villas, Cuba, Urrutia was a leading figure in the civil resistance movement against Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s government during the Cuban Revolution. He was the agreed choice for the future president among Fidel Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement as early as April 1958.

In 1957, he had presided in court over a case in which members of the movement had been charged with &quot;anti-government activities&quot;. He ruled that the defendants had been acting within their rights.

A year later, he visited the US to gain support for the revolution, successfully lobbying for a halt of weapons shipments to Batista&#x27;s forces. It was considered that the choice of Urrutia, an educated liberal and Christian, as president would be welcomed by the US.

==Presidency==
The Cuban Revolution gained victory on January 1, 1959, and Urrutia returned from exile in Venezuela to take up residence in the presidential palace. His new revolutionary government consisted largely of Cuban political veterans and pro-business liberals including José Miró, who was appointed as prime minister.

Once in power, Urrutia swiftly began a program of closing all brothels, gambling outlets and the national lottery, arguing that these had long been a corrupting influence on the state. The measures drew immediate resistance from the large associated workforce. The disapproving Castro, then commander of Cuba&#x27;s new armed forces, intervened to request a stay of execution until alternative employment could be found.

Disagreements also arose in the new government concerning pay cuts, which were imposed on all public officials on Castro&#x27;s demand. The disputed cuts included a reduction of the $100,000 a year presidential salary Urrutia had inherited from Batista. By February, following the surprise resignation of Miró, Castro had assumed the role of prime minister; this strengthened his power and rendered Urrutia increasingly a figurehead president. As Urrutia&#x27;s participation in the legislative process declined, other unresolved disputes between the two leaders continued to fester. His belief in the restoration of elections was rejected by Castro, who felt that they would usher in a return to the old discredited system of corrupt parties and fraudulent balloting that had marked the Batista era.

Urrutia was then accused by the &quot;Avance&quot; newspaper of buying a luxury villa, which was portrayed as a frivolous betrayal of the revolution and led to an outcry from the general public. He denied the allegation issuing a writ against the newspaper in response. The story further increased tensions between the various factions in the government, though Urrutia asserted publicly that he had &quot;absolutely no disagreements&quot; with Fidel Castro. Urrutia attempted to distance the Cuban government (including Castro) from the growing influence of the Communists within the administration, making a series of critical public comments against the latter group. Whilst Castro had not openly declared any affiliation with the Cuban communists, Urrutia had been a declared anti-Communist since they had refused to support the insurrection against Batista, stating in an interview, &quot;If the Cuban people had heeded those words, we would still have Batista with us ... and all those other war criminals who are now running away&quot;.

===Resignation===
On July 17, 1959, Conrado Bécquer, the sugar workers&#x27; leader, demanded Urrutia&#x27;s resignation. Castro himself resigned as Prime Minister of Cuba in protest, but later that day appeared on television to deliver a lengthy denouncement of Urrutia, claiming that Urrutia &quot;complicated&quot; government, and that his &quot;fevered anti-Communism&quot; was having a detrimental effect. Castro&#x27;s sentiments received widespread support as organized crowds surrounded the presidential palace demanding Urrutia&#x27;s resignation, which was duly received. On July 23, Castro resumed his position as premier and appointed Osvaldo Dorticós as the new president.

==After Cuba==
After leaving his post, Urrutia sought asylum in the embassy of Venezuela before settling in Queens, New York, United States. He worked as a university professor until his death in 1981, in Queens, New York.

<doc id="734784" wikidata="Q2306500" url="?curid=734784" title="Suat Hayri Ürgüplü">
<text>Ali Suat Hayri Ürgüplü (13 August 1903 – 26 December 1981) was a Turkish politician who served a brief term as Prime Minister of Turkey in 1965. He was also the last Prime Minister to be born outside the territory of present-day Turkey, being born in Damascus, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire.

==Early life==
Ürgüplü graduated from Galatasaray High School. He was the descendant of a distinguished line of Ottoman religious scholars and administrators. His father was the celebrated Sheikh ul-Islam Ürgüplü Hayri Efendi, minister of religious affairs under the Committee of Union and Progress (or Young Turk) regime of 1913–1918.

==Career==
After a brief career as a judge, Ürgüplü entered the Parliament in 1939 and served as Minister of Customs and Public Monopolies in the Şükrü Saracoğlu cabinet in 1947–1948. He returned to the Senate of Parliament in 1961 and was its Chairman from 27 November 1963 to 6 November 1963. Ürgüplü was asked to form a non-partisan caretaker cabinet after the collapse of Premier İsmet İnönü&#x27;s coalition government in 1965. The cabinet was formed on 5 February, and served until the parliamentary elections of 10 October, although it never received a vote of confidence in Parliament. Ürgüplü continued to serve in the Senate until 1972.

==Death==
Ürgüplü died on 27 December 1981 in Istanbul and was interred at the Edirnekapı Martyr&#x27;s Cemetery.

==Issue==
His son Hayri Ürgüplü (b. 31 May 1936) married in Paris, France, on 10 April 1965, Princess Sabiha Fazile Ibrahim Hanımsultan of Egypt. The couple had two sons: Ali Suad Ürgüplü (b. 28 September 1967) and Mehmed Selim Ürgüplü (b. 31 October 1968). The couple divorced on 24 September 1980.

<doc id="734785" wikidata="Q5647933" url="?curid=734785" title="Hangedup">
<text>Hangedup was an experimental rock duo from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, featuring Genevieve Heistek on Viola and Eric Craven on drums and percussion. They combined viola with strong percussion, sometimes using self-made instruments, to create intense experimental Post-rock music.

==History==
Heistek and Craven performed with the band Sackville. Heistek was also part of The Mile End Ladies String Auxiliary, Set Fire to Flames, HṚṢṬA, and Land of Kush. Craven was associated with Shortwave, HṚṢṬA, and formerly Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band. In 1999 they came together to form Hangedup, and were signed in Montréal by Sackville&#x27;s label, Constellation Records. 

Their first album, self-titled, was recorded at Hotel2Tango studios and released in 2001. In 2002, they released &quot;Kicker in Tow&quot;. &quot;Clatter for Control&quot; came out in 2005.

In 2012, Constellation released &quot;Musique Fragile 02&quot;, a limited-edition boxed set of three vinyl LPs: one each from the bands Kanada 70 and Pacha, and &quot;Transit of Venus&quot;, a six-track collaborative album by Hangedup and Tony Conrad.

Hangedup performed all over the world. In 2003, it played Barcelona&#x27;s Primavera Sound Festival. In October 2005, Hangedup joined Patti Smith and Guy Picciotto onstage at Jem Cohen&#x27;s Fusebox festival in Ghent. In December 2010, the duo appeared at England&#x27;s All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties in Butlin&#x27;s Minehead.

Also in 2012, Hangedup was featured in &quot;And We Made the Room Shine&quot;, a film by François Clos and Thomas Lallier about Constellation Records. The film was presented at the 2012 Vienna International Film Festival.

<doc id="734787" wikidata="Q787371" url="?curid=734787" title="Automatic differentiation">
<text>In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (auto-differentiation, autodiff, or AD), also called algorithmic differentiation, computational differentiation, and differentiation arithmetic is a set of techniques to evaluate the partial derivative of a function specified by a computer program. Automatic differentiation is a subtle and central tool to automatize the simultaneous computation of the numerical values of arbitrarily complex functions and their derivatives with no need for the symbolic representation of the derivative, only the function rule or an algorithm thereof is required. Auto-differentiation is thus neither numeric nor symbolic, nor is it a combination of both. It is also preferable to ordinary numerical methods: In contrast to the more traditional numerical methods based on finite differences, auto-differentiation is &#x27;in theory&#x27; exact, and in comparison to symbolic algorithms, it is computationally inexpensive.

Automatic differentiation exploits the fact that every computer calculation, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, partial derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor of more arithmetic operations than the original program.

== Difference from other differentiation methods ==

Automatic differentiation is distinct from symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation. 
Symbolic differentiation faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single mathematical expression and can lead to inefficient code. Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences) can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation. Both of these classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where complexity and errors increase. Finally, both of these classical methods are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to &quot;many&quot; inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems.

== Applications ==
Currently, for its efficiency and accuracy in computing first and higher order derivatives, auto-differentiation is a celebrated technique with diverse applications in scientific computing and mathematics. It should therefore come as no surprise that there are numerous computational implementations of auto-differentiation. Among these, one mentions INTLAB, Sollya, and InCLosure. In practice, there are two types (modes) of algorithmic differentiation: a forward-type and a reversed-type. Presently, the two types are highly correlated and complementary and both have a wide variety of applications in, e.g., non-linear optimization, sensitivity analysis, robotics, machine learning, computer graphics, and computer vision. Automatic differentiation is particularly important in the field of machine learning. For example, it allows one to implement backpropagation in a neural network without a manually-computed derivative.

== Forward and reverse accumulation ==
=== Chain rule of partial derivatives of composite functions ===
Fundamental to automatic differentiation is the decomposition of differentials provided by the chain rule of partial derivatives of composite functions. For the simple composition
formula_1
the chain rule gives
formula_2

=== Two types of automatic differentiation ===
Usually, two distinct modes of automatic differentiation are presented.
* forward accumulation (also called bottom-up, forward mode, or tangent mode)
* reverse accumulation (also called top-down, reverse mode, or adjoint mode)
Forward accumulation specifies that one traverses the chain rule from inside to outside (that is, first compute formula_3 and then formula_4 and at last formula_5), while reverse accumulation has the traversal from outside to inside (first compute formula_5 and then formula_4 and at last formula_8). More succinctly,
* Forward accumulation computes the recursive relation: formula_9 with formula_10, and,
* Reverse accumulation computes the recursive relation: formula_11 with formula_12.

The value of the partial derivative, called &quot;seed&quot;, is propagated forward or backward and is initially formula_13 or formula_14. Forward accumulation evaluates the function and calculates the derivative with respect to one independent variable in one pass. For each independent variable formula_15 a separate pass is therefore necessary in which the derivative with respect to that independent variable is set to one (formula_16) and of all others to zero (formula_17). In contrast, reverse accumulation requires the evaluated partial functions for the partial derivatives. Reverse accumulation therefore evaluates the function first and calculates the derivatives with respect to all independent variables in an additional pass.

Which of these two types should be used depends on the sweep count. The computational complexity of one sweep is proportional to the complexity of the original code.
* Forward accumulation is more efficient than reverse accumulation for functions with as only sweeps are necessary, compared to sweeps for reverse accumulation.
* Reverse accumulation is more efficient than forward accumulation for functions with as only sweeps are necessary, compared to sweeps for forward accumulation.
Backpropagation of errors in multilayer perceptrons, a technique used in machine learning, is a special case of reverse accumulation.

Forward accumulation was introduced by R.E. Wengert in 1964. According to Andreas Griewank, reverse accumulation has been suggested since the late 1960s, but the inventor is unknown. Seppo Linnainmaa published reverse accumulation in 1976.

=== Forward accumulation ===

In forward accumulation AD, one first fixes the &quot;independent variable&quot; with respect to which differentiation is performed and computes the derivative of each sub-expression recursively. In a pen-and-paper calculation, this involves repeatedly substituting the derivative of the &quot;inner&quot; functions in the chain rule:
formula_18
This can be generalized to multiple variables as a matrix product of Jacobians.

Compared to reverse accumulation, forward accumulation is natural and easy to implement as the flow of derivative information coincides with the order of evaluation. Each variable formula_19 is augmented with its derivative formula_20 (stored as a numerical value, not a symbolic expression),
formula_21
as denoted by the dot. The derivatives are then computed in sync with the evaluation steps and combined with other derivatives via the chain rule.

Using the chain rule, if formula_19 has predecessors in the computational graph:
:formula_23

As an example, consider the function:
formula_24
For clarity, the individual sub-expressions have been labeled with the variables formula_19.

The choice of the independent variable to which differentiation is performed affects the &quot;seed&quot; values and . Given interest in the derivative of this function with respect to , the seed values should be set to:
formula_26

With the seed values set, the values propagate using the chain rule as shown. Figure 2 shows a pictorial depiction of this process as a computational graph.

To compute the gradient of this example function, which requires not only formula_27 but also formula_28, an &quot;additional&quot; sweep is performed over the computational graph using the seed values formula_29.

==== Implementation ====
===== Pseudocode =====
Forward accumulation calculates the function and the derivative (but only for one independent variable each) in one pass. The associated method call expects the expression &quot;Z&quot; to be derived with regard to a variable &quot;V&quot;. The method returns a pair of the evaluated function and its derivative. The method traverses the expression tree recursively until a variable is reached. If the derivative with respect to this variable is requested, its derivative is 1, 0 otherwise. Then the partial function as well as the partial derivative are evaluated.

tuple&lt;float,float&gt; evaluateAndDerive(Expression Z, Variable V) {
 if isVariable(Z)
 if (Z = V) return {valueOf(Z), 1};
 else return {valueOf(Z), 0};
 else if (Z = A + B)
 {a, a&#x27;} = evaluateAndDerive(A, V);
 {b, b&#x27;} = evaluateAndDerive(B, V);
 return {a + b, a&#x27; + b&#x27;};
 else if (Z = A - B)
 {a, a&#x27;} = evaluateAndDerive(A, V);
 {b, b&#x27;} = evaluateAndDerive(B, V);
 return {a - b, a&#x27; - b&#x27;};
 else if (Z = A * B)
 {a, a&#x27;} = evaluateAndDerive(A, V);
 {b, b&#x27;} = evaluateAndDerive(B, V);
 return {a * b, b * a&#x27; + a * b&#x27;};

 « &quot;∂z/∂y = &quot; « yPartial « std::endl;
 // Output: ∂z/∂x = 7, ∂z/∂y = 8
 return 0;


=== Reverse accumulation ===

In reverse accumulation AD, the &quot;dependent variable&quot; to be differentiated is fixed and the derivative is computed &quot;with respect to&quot; each sub-expression recursively. In a pen-and-paper calculation, the derivative of the &quot;outer&quot; functions is repeatedly substituted in the chain rule:
formula_30

In reverse accumulation, the quantity of interest is the &quot;adjoint&quot;, denoted with a bar formula_31; it is a derivative of a chosen dependent variable with respect to a subexpression formula_19:
formula_33

Using the chain rule, if formula_19 has successors in the computational graph:
:formula_35

Reverse accumulation traverses the chain rule from outside to inside, or in the case of the computational graph in Figure 3, from top to bottom. The example function is scalar-valued, and thus there is only one seed for the derivative computation, and only one sweep of the computational graph is needed to calculate the (two-component) gradient. This is only half the work when compared to forward accumulation, but reverse accumulation requires the storage of the intermediate variables as well as the instructions that produced them in a data structure known as a &quot;tape&quot; or a Wengert list (however, Wengert published forward accumulation, not reverse accumulation), which may consume significant memory if the computational graph is large. This can be mitigated to some extent by storing only a subset of the intermediate variables and then reconstructing the necessary work variables by repeating the evaluations, a technique known as rematerialization. Checkpointing is also used to save intermediary states.

The operations to compute the derivative using reverse accumulation are shown in the table below (note the reversed order):

The data flow graph of a computation can be manipulated to calculate the gradient of its original calculation. This is done by adding an adjoint node for each primal node, connected by adjoint edges which parallel the primal edges but flow in the opposite direction. The nodes in the adjoint graph represent multiplication by the derivatives of the functions calculated by the nodes in the primal. For instance, addition in the primal causes fanout in the adjoint; fanout in the primal causes addition in the adjoint; a unary function in the primal causes in the adjoint; etc.

==== Implementation ====
===== Pseudo code =====
Reverse accumulation requires two passes: In the forward pass, the function is evaluated first and the partial results are cached. In the reverse pass, the partial derivatives are calculated and the previously derived value is backpropagated. The corresponding method call expects the expression &quot;Z&quot; to be derived and &quot;seed&quot; with the derived value of the parent expression. For the top expression, Z derived with regard to Z, this is 1. The method traverses the expression tree recursively until a variable is reached and adds the current &quot;seed&quot; value to the derivative expression.

void derive(Expression Z, float seed) {
 if isVariable(Z)
 partialDerivativeOf(Z) += seed;
 else if (Z = A + B)
 derive(A, seed);
 derive(B, seed);
 else if (Z = A - B)
 derive(A, seed);
 derive(B, -seed);
 else if (Z = A * B)
 derive(A, valueOf(B) * seed);
 derive(B, valueOf(A) * seed);

=== Beyond forward and reverse accumulation ===

Forward and reverse accumulation are just two (extreme) ways of traversing the chain rule. The problem of computing a full Jacobian of with a minimum number of arithmetic operations is known as the &quot;optimal Jacobian accumulation&quot; (OJA) problem, which is NP-complete. Central to this proof is the idea that algebraic dependencies may exist between the local partials that label the edges of the graph. In particular, two or more edge labels may be recognized as equal. The complexity of the problem is still open if it is assumed that all edge labels are unique and algebraically independent.

== Automatic differentiation using dual numbers ==

Forward mode automatic differentiation is accomplished by augmenting the algebra of real numbers and obtaining a new arithmetic. An additional component is added to every number to represent the derivative of a function at the number, and all arithmetic operators are extended for the augmented algebra. The augmented algebra is the algebra of dual numbers.

Replace every number formula_36 with the number formula_37, where formula_38 is a real number, but formula_39 is an abstract number with the property formula_40 (an infinitesimal; see &quot;Smooth infinitesimal analysis&quot;). Using only this, regular arithmetic gives
formula_41
using formula_42.

Now, polynomials can be calculated in this augmented arithmetic. If formula_43, then
formula_44
where formula_45 denotes the derivative of formula_46 with respect to its first argument, and formula_38, called a &quot;seed&quot;, can be chosen arbitrarily.

The new arithmetic consists of ordered pairs, elements written formula_48, with ordinary arithmetics on the first component, and first order differentiation arithmetic on the second component, as described above. Extending the above results on polynomials to analytic functions gives a list of the basic arithmetic and some standard functions for the new arithmetic:
formula_49
and in general for the primitive function formula_50,
formula_51
where formula_52 and formula_53 are the derivatives of formula_50 with respect to its first and second arguments, respectively.

When a binary basic arithmetic operation is applied to mixed arguments—the pair formula_55 and the real number formula_56—the real number is first lifted to formula_57. The derivative of a function formula_58 at the point formula_59 is now found by calculating formula_60 using the above arithmetic, which gives formula_61 as the result.

=== Implementation ===
An example implementation based on the dual number approach follows.

==== Pseudo code ====
==== C++ ====

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
struct Dual {
 float realPart, infinitesimalPart;
 Dual(float realPart, float infinitesimalPart=0): realPart(realPart), infinitesimalPart(infinitesimalPart) {}
 Dual operator+(Dual other) {
 return Dual(
 realPart + other.realPart,
 infinitesimalPart + other.infinitesimalPart
 }
 Dual operator*(Dual other) {
 return Dual(
 realPart * other.realPart,
 other.realPart * infinitesimalPart + realPart * other.infinitesimalPart
 }
// Example: Finding the partials of z = x * (x + y) + y * y at (x, y) = (2, 3)
Dual f(Dual x, Dual y) { return x * (x + y) + y * y; }
int main () {
 Dual x = Dual(2);
 Dual y = Dual(3);
 Dual epsilon = Dual(0, 1);
 Dual a = f(x + epsilon, y);
 Dual b = f(x, y + epsilon);
 std::cout « &quot;∂z/∂x = &quot; « a.infinitesimalPart « &quot;, &quot;
 « &quot;∂z/∂y = &quot; « b.infinitesimalPart « std::endl;
 // Output: ∂z/∂x = 7, ∂z/∂y = 8
 return 0;


===Vector arguments and functions===

Multivariate functions can be handled with the same efficiency and mechanisms as univariate functions by adopting a directional derivative operator. That is, if it is sufficient to compute formula_62, the directional derivative formula_63 of formula_64 at formula_65 in the direction formula_66 may be calculated as formula_67 using the same arithmetic as above. If all the elements of formula_68 are desired, then formula_69 function evaluations are required. Note that in many optimization applications, the directional derivative is indeed sufficient.

===High order and many variables===

The above arithmetic can be generalized to calculate second order and higher derivatives of multivariate functions. However, the arithmetic rules quickly grow complicated: complexity is quadratic in the highest derivative degree. Instead, truncated Taylor polynomial algebra can be used. The resulting arithmetic, defined on generalized dual numbers, allows efficient computation using functions as if they were a data type. Once the Taylor polynomial of a function is known, the derivatives are easily extracted.

== Implementation ==

Forward-mode AD is implemented by a nonstandard interpretation of the program in which real numbers are replaced by dual numbers, constants are lifted to dual numbers with a zero epsilon coefficient, and the numeric primitives are lifted to operate on dual numbers. This nonstandard interpretation is generally implemented using one of two strategies: &quot;source code transformation&quot; or &quot;operator overloading&quot;.

=== Source code transformation (SCT) ===
The source code for a function is replaced by an automatically generated source code that includes statements for calculating the derivatives interleaved with the original instructions.

Source code transformation can be implemented for all programming languages, and it is also easier for the compiler to do compile time optimizations. However, the implementation of the AD tool itself is more difficult and the build system is more complex.

=== Operator overloading (OO) ===
Operator overloading is a possibility for source code written in a language supporting it. Objects for real numbers and elementary mathematical operations must be overloaded to cater for the augmented arithmetic depicted above. This requires no change in the form or sequence of operations in the original source code for the function to be differentiated, but often requires changes in basic data types for numbers and vectors to support overloading and often also involves the insertion of special flagging operations. Due to the inherent operator overloading overhead on each loop, this approach usually demonstrates weaker speed performance.

=== Operator overloading and source code transformation ===
Overloaded Operators can be used to extract the valuation graph, followed by automatic generation of the AD-version of the primal function at run-time. Unlike the classic OO AAD, such AD-function does not change from one iteration to the next one. Hence there is any OO or tape interpretation run-time overhead per Xi sample.

With the AD-function being generated at runtime, it can be optimised to take into account the current state of the program and precompute certain values. In addition, it can be generated in a way to consistently utilize native CPU vectorization to process 4(8)-double chunks of user data (AVX2\AVX512 speed up x4-x8). With multithreading added into account, such approach can lead to a final acceleration of order 8 × #Cores compared to the traditional AAD tools. A reference implementation is available on GitHub.

<text>Marquess of Powis was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1687 for William Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis. He had already succeeded his father as third Baron Powis in 1667 and had been created Earl of Powis in the Peerage of England in 1674; Marquess of Powis and Viscount Montgomery in 1687. When James II went into exile in France, the Marquess followed him. He served as Comptroller of the Royal Household and his wife Elizabeth as Governess of the Royal children. He was rewarded in 1698 by the titles Duke of Powis and Marquess of Montgomery, but these titles in the Jacobite Peerage (though used) were not recognised in England.

The title of Baron Powis was created in the Peerage of England in 1629 for William Herbert. He was the son of Sir Edward Herbert, second son of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and Anne Parr. This Herbert family were thus members of a junior branch of the prominent Welsh family headed by the Earl of Pembroke. The peerages became extinct on the death of the first Marquess&#x27;s grandson, the third Marquess, in 1748.

Barbara, daughter of Lord Edward Herbert, younger son of the second Marquess of Powis and brother of the third Marquess, married Henry Arthur Herbert, who was created Earl of Powis in 1748. They inherited his estates. See this title for more information.

==Baron Powis (1629)==
*William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis (c. 1573–1655) 
*Percy Herbert, 2nd Baron Powis (c. 1600–1667) (had been created a Baronet, of Red Castle, in 1622)
*William Herbert, 3rd Baron Powis (1626–1696) (created Earl of Powis in 1674)

===Earl of Powis (1674)===
*William Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis (1626–1696) (created Marquess of Powis in 1687)

===Marquess of Powis (1687)===
*William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis (1626–1696)
*William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis (1665–1745). Powis was the only son of William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, and Lady Elizabeth Somerset. He married Mary Preston in 1695. They had six children: William Herbert, 3rd Marquess of Powis; Lord Edward Herbert; Lady Mary Herbert; Lady Anne Herbert; Lady Charlotte Herbert; and Lady Theresa Herbert. His second son, Edward (died 1734), married Henrietta Waldegrave, daughter of James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave in July 1734. They had one child: Lady Barbara Herbert (1735–1786)
*William Herbert, 3rd Marquess of Powis (1698–1748). Powis was the son of William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis, and Mary Preston. He died unmarried in 1748.

<text>Mogoșoaia Palace (, ) is situated about from Bucharest, Romania. It was built between 1698 and 1702 by Constantin Brâncoveanu in what is called the Romanian Renaissance style or Brâncovenesc style. The palace bears the name of the widow of the Romanian boyar Mogoș, who owned the land it was built on.

==History==

After 1714, when Constantin Brâncoveanu was executed with his entire family in Constantinople, all the family&#x27;s wealth was confiscated by the Ottomans and the palace was converted into an inn. Rebought by Prince Ștefan Cantacuzino, he returned it to Brâncoveanu&#x27;s grandson Constantin, and remained with the family until the early nineteenth century.

The palace was devastated by the Ottomans during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. It was later granted by prince Grigore to his daughter, Zoe Mavrocordat, who had married George D. Bibescu, sovereign Prince of Wallachia. The palace remained within Bibescu family and was renovated by Nicolae Bibescu.

In November 1916, during the Romanian Campaign of World War I, the palace at Mogoșoaia was bombed by the German air forces.
Bought from Marie-Nicole by her cousin (and head of the princely house), Prince George Bibesco, the palace was given to his wife, Princess Martha. He later deeded the land to her, too. Martha spent her private fortune for the reconstruction. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, the palace became the meeting place for politicians and for the international high society. 
When Prince George died in 1941, he was buried in the small, white 1688 church on the grounds of the palace.

During World War II, Prince Antoine Bibesco (a cousin of George Bibesco) and his wife Elizabeth Bibesco refused to flee the country. When Elizabeth died of pneumonia on April 7, 1945, she was buried in the Bibesco family vault on the grounds of Mogoșoaia. Neither Elizabeth Bibesco&#x27;s husband, Antoine, nor George Bibesco&#x27;s wife, Martha, could be buried beside them, as they both died during the Communist regime. After 1945, the palace was forcibly nationalized by the communist authorities, and the owners, Valentina and Dimitrie Ghika-Comănești, were arrested. Some of its precious art collections disappeared during this period. In 1957, it eventually became a museum.

The palace is now a popular tourist destination, but although the grounds and gardens are beautiful, the interior of the palace itself is under reconstruction and presently houses a museum and art gallery (&quot;Muzeul de Artă Brâncovenească&quot;).

The exterior and tunnels of the complex were featured in 2018 film &quot;The Nun&quot;.

<text>Charles-Arthur Gauthier (; May 12, 1913 – May 12, 1997) was a Canadian undertaker and long-time politician. He was a member of Parliament (MP) for the Social Credit Party and &quot;Ralliement Créditiste&quot;. Gauthier was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada representing Roberval, Quebec, in the 1962 election. In 1963, he and numerous other Quebec Socred MPs joined Réal Caouette in forming the &quot;Ralliement Créditiste&quot;, a Quebec breakaway from the federal Social Credit Party that rejoined the federal party in 1971.

Gauthier was acting leader of the Social Credit Party following the resignation of Gilles Caouette in 1978 and again in 1979 following the resignation of Lorne Reznowski. Gauthier said he did not wish to lead the party into an election and Fabien Roy was drafted as leader. Gauthier retained his seat in the 1979 federal election but was defeated in the 1980 election that wiped out the party.

<doc id="734799" wikidata="Q5504856" url="?curid=734799" title="Jack Cohen (businessman)">
<text>Sir John Edward Cohen (born Jacob Kohen; 6 October 1898 – 24 March 1979) was an English businessman who founded the Tesco supermarket chain. His company is the market leader of groceries in the UK, and the third-largest retailer in the world measured by gross revenues in 2011.

After serving in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, Cohen opened a market stall in Hackney, London in 1919. The first Tesco store opened in Edgware, north London, and by 1939 he had more than 100 stores, including the first stores outside London. He then floated the company onto the London Stock Exchange in 1947. As chairman of Tesco Stores (Holdings) Ltd. Cohen was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1969.

==Early and private life==
Cohen was born in Whitechapel in the East End of London and grew up at 91 Ashfield Street. His family were Jewish: his father, Avroam Kohen, was a Polish immigrant from Łódź who worked as a tailor, and his mother was Sime Zaremba. He was named Jacob but was known as Jack from an early age. He was educated at Rutland Street School until he was aged 14 and then began his working life as an apprentice tailor to his father. His mother died in 1915 and his father remarried.

In 1917, he volunteered to join the Royal Flying Corps where he used his tailoring skills as a canvas maker for balloons and other aircraft. He served in France, and also in Egypt and Palestine. In December 1917, he was on board , a passenger and cargo ship that had been taken over by the Royal Navy as a supply ship and troopship. The vessel had sailed from Southampton carrying soldiers and medical personnel. But just as it reached its destination, Alexandria on the 31st, it struck a mine that had been laid at the harbour entrance a few days earlier by the German submarine . The ship sank in less than seven minutes with the loss of 209 people, including soldiers, nurses, ship&#x27;s crew and the ship&#x27;s captain. Cohen survived, thanks to a nurse who helped him stay afloat in the water. He returned to England after contracting malaria, and was demobilised in 1919.

He married Sarah (Cissie) Fox, daughter of an immigrant Russian-Jewish tailor, in 1924. Cissie was a great supporter of her husband&#x27;s business interests, so much so that the money they received as wedding gifts was invested in a wholesale venture. They had two daughters, Sybil Irene (1926–2005) and Shirley (born 1930). Irene married Hyman Kreitman (1914–2001) and Shirley married Leslie Porter (1920–2005).

Cohen formally changed his name from Jacob Kohen to John Edward Cohen by deed poll in July 1937.

He continued to work after a colostomy operation in 1958, standing down as chairman of Tesco in 1969. He died on 24 March 1979 at the age of 80 in Westminster and is buried in Willesden Jewish Cemetery.

==Career==
Cohen was reluctant to return to tailoring after the First World War, and he established himself as a market stall holder in Hackney, in London&#x27;s East End, by purchasing surplus NAAFI stock with his £30 demob money. At each market the traders would gather and, at a signal, they would race to their favoured pitch. Cohen could not run fast so he simply threw his cap at the spot and this could beat anyone. He soon became the owner of a number of market stalls, and started a wholesale business. Initially the other stalls were run by members of the family, but gradually non-family members were added. Cohen and his wife Elizabeth worked seven days a week, starting at dawn and counting money until late.

In 1924, he created the Tesco brand name from the initials of a partner tea supplier, T. E. Stockwell (formerly Messrs Torring and Stockwell of Mincing Lane), and the first two letters of his surname. The market trading business became difficult to expand because partners tended to be unreliable, so eventually he changed to high street shops without doors, looking and sounding as far as possible like market stalls. The first two Tesco stores opened at Becontree and Burnt Oak in 1931. By 1939, Cohen owned a hundred Tesco stores. His expansion was helped by the growth of new shopping centres. Retailers are often reluctant to be the first to sign a contract in a new centre lest they become the only ones. With his market experience and courage, Cohen was often the one to take that risk and he had ways of drawing a crowd. Developers became keen to help him with his start-up costs because of his ability to get people into a new centre, benefiting the other shops.

The first Tesco bank account was opened at the Midland Bank in the Narroway, Mare Street, Hackney. A plaque in the branch later marked this event. On 2 July 1937 he changed his name by deed poll to John Edward at the suggestion of his bank manager, whose staff had trouble distinguishing between the many Jacob Cohens banking at the branch in Hackney.

In 1932, having opened his first Tesco-branded shops, Cohen travelled to the United States to review their self-service supermarkets. At the time he was not impressed and felt they would never be accepted in the UK. After the war he took another look and listened to his son-in-law Hyman Kreitman, who was very keen. He opened one of the first British supermarkets. The new strategy was led by Kreitman, who understood how to manage this new style of shop and the crucial tasks of mass buying, selling and logistics. Tesco grew strongly. It gradually drew ahead of its rivals and took over many of them.

He expanded the company by takeovers and mergers, making it the fourth largest chain in the United Kingdom by 1968 (behind Co-op, Fine Fare, and Allied Suppliers). He campaigned against retail price maintenance, tackled in the second half of the 1960s by the Resale Prices Act 1964, and was a leading instigator of the Green Shield trading stamps scheme in 1963.

==Honours==

Cohen was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1969 New Year Honours. He was master of the Worshipful Company of Carmen in 1976–77. Sir John and Lady Cohen supported a range of charities in Britain and in Israel, giving their name to the Jewish Care facility, Lady Sarah Cohen House, at Friern Barnet, north London.

In 2009, an English Heritage blue plaque was placed at 91 Ashfield Street, Whitechapel, London, where Cohen lived as a child.

In 2018, Tesco founded a new discount chain named after Cohen, called Jack&#x27;s. In addition, the name T.E. Stockwell was introduced the same year for use on selected food products, replacing the Tesco Value brand on these goods.

<doc id="734804" wikidata="Q4917406" url="?curid=734804" title="Bishop's Cleeve">
<text>Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Tewkesbury in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England. The village lies at the foot of Cleeve Hill, the highest point in the Cotswolds. Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve had a population of 10,612 in 2011, which has increased to 14,068 in the 2021 Census. The village is from Gloucester and from Oxford. The village is also close to the towns of Cheltenham , Tewkesbury , Evesham , and Malvern .

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Cleeve&quot;, first attested in the eighth century as &quot;Clife&quot;, comes from the dative singular form of the Old English word &quot;clif&quot; (&#x27;at the cliff, bank, steep hill&#x27;). The element &#x27;Bishop&#x27;s&#x27; became attached to the name because the estate was owned by the bishops of Worcester.

== Railway past ==
Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve was once served by a railway line, a relative latecomer in British railway history, opened on 1 June 1906 by the Great Western Railway and running from Stratford-upon-Avon to Cheltenham, part of a mainline from Birmingham to the South West and South Wales. Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve railway station along with almost all others on this section closed on 7 March 1960 and was subsequently demolished, but the nearby Cheltenham Racecourse railway station remained in operation for royal visits to the racecourse until 1965; through passenger services continued until 25 March 1968, and goods until 1976 when a derailment (railway accident) at Winchcombe damaged the line.

With the damage done, It was decided not to bring the section back into use and by 1980 the entire line had been dismantled. However, the stretch of track between Broadway and Cheltenham Racecourse had since been reconstructed, reopened and preserved as the Heritage Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway.

Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve was also served, though less well, by a station, called Cleeve railway station, on the present Birmingham to Bristol main line (ex-Midland Railway, later LMS), about to the west, but this station closed on 20 February 1950.

Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve is bordered by the village of Woodmancote to the east, the former Great Western railway line dividing the two parishes. In 2020, the population of Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve was 16,477.

== Education ==
Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve has three schools; Grangefield Primary School, Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve Primary Academy, which was built in 1965, and Cleeve School, an academy school in the south-east of the village.

== Infrastructure &amp; Development ==
Bishops Cleeve is served by the A435 running through the western side of the village, with direct access to Cheltenham and Evesham. In 2012, the local police station was closed down, part of the county&#x27;s aim of saving £18 million across the constabulary. The village benefits from a local library and a wide range of community facilities including sports centres, a youth centre, bowling greens, and a local football club.

In 2010, the development of 450 houses began at Homelands Farm, with the developers, Comparo, wanting to build an extra 550 houses on top of this. This was rejected by Tewkesbury Borough Council in 2007, but the developers appealed to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government about the decision, which triggered a full planning inquiry. The main concerns stated were the strain on the local infrastructure it would create, and that the site is prone to flooding. In 2013 the Secretary of State upheld the appeal, 550 dwellings are to be built in the north-west of Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve and a further 500 dwellings between Gotherington and Cleeve.

== Local shops and businesses ==

There are retail shops in Church Road, Tobyfield Road and The Green. There is an industrial estate with many employers as well as a gym and other facilities.

<text>Mayda (variously known as Maida, Mayd, Mayde, Brazir, Mam, Asmaida, Asmayda, Bentusle, Las Maidas Bolunda and Vlaanderen) is a non-existent island in the North Atlantic that has been shown on several published maps at various points in history. It was most often represented as being crescent-shaped and its position has varied widely over time. Early maps drew the island west of Brittany and southwest of Ireland, but it later moved towards the Americas (Newfoundland, Bermuda, West Indies).

==History==
The island first appeared under the name of Brazir, on the Pizigani brothers&#x27; 1367 map. It was crescent-shaped and sited southwest of the island of Brasil, on the same latitude of southern Brittany.

It appeared as Asmaidas on a map of the New World accompanying Waldseemüller&#x27;s 1513 edition of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;.

Ortelius (in &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot;) placed a crescent-shaped island in the traditional location of Mayda with the name &quot;Vlaenderen&quot; (&quot;Flanders&quot;).

Submerged land of the appropriate shape has been found in the area of early maps () at a depth of which suggested to one author that Mayda may have existed.

The island is the namesake of Mayda Insula, an island in the Kraken Mare on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan.

==Appearances on maps==
*Pizigani brothers map (1367) as Brazir
*Catalan map (1375) as Mam
*Pinelli map (1384) as Jonzele/I.Onzele
* Pizzigano Map (1424) either as Ventura or Ymana.
*Bianco world map (1448) as Bentusla
*Waldseemüller map (1513) as Asmaidas 
*Prunes map (1553) as Mayda
*Nicolay map (1560) as I man orbolunda

==In popular culture==
*The island of Mayda is a principal location in the novel &quot;A Web of Air&quot; by Philip Reeve.

<text>Sir Thomas Urquhart (1611–1660) was a Scottish aristocrat, writer, and translator. He is best known for his translation of the works of French Renaissance writer François Rabelais to English.

==Biography==
Urquhart was born to Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty and Christian Elphinstone, daughter of Alexander Elphinstone, 4th Lord Elphinstone. At the age of eleven he attended King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen. Afterwards he toured the Continent, returning in 1636. In 1639, he participated in the Royalist uprising known as the Trot of Turriff; he was knighted by Charles I at Whitehall for his support. In 1641 he published his first book, a volume of epigrams.

Urquhart&#x27;s father died in 1642, leaving behind a large estate encumbered by larger debts. As the eldest son, Urquhart was from that time on harassed by creditors. He left for the Continent in order to economize, but returned in 1645 and published &quot;Trissotetras&quot;, a mathematical treatise.

In 1648, Urquhart participated in the Royalist uprising at Inverness. He was declared a traitor by Parliament, though he doesn&#x27;t seem to have suffered any other consequences. Two years later he marched with Charles II and fought in the Battle of Worcester. The Royalist forces were decisively defeated and Urquhart was taken prisoner. He lost all his manuscripts, which he had brought with him for safekeeping, and he had to forfeit all his property. He was held first at the Tower of London and later at Windsor, but he was given considerable freedom by his captors. The following year he published &quot;Pantochronachanon&quot;, a work of genealogy, and &quot;The Jewel&quot;, a defense of Scotland. In 1652, he was paroled by Cromwell and returned to Cromarty. Soon after he published &quot;Logopandecteision&quot;, his plan for a universal language, and his most celebrated work, his translation of Rabelais.

Urquhart returned to the Continent some time after 1653, perhaps as a condition of his release by Cromwell. Little is known of his life after this time. He died no later than 1660, because in that year his younger brother took up his hereditary titles.

There is a legend that Urquhart died in a fit of laughter on receiving news of the Restoration of Charles II.

==Works==
; &quot;Epigrams, Divine and Moral&quot; (1641) : Collections of epigrams were fashionable in the mid seventeenth century, but Urquhart&#x27;s contribution to the genre has not been highly regarded. Most critics have concluded that the sentiments are largely banal and the versification inept.

; &quot;Trissotetras&quot; (1645) : &quot;Trissotetras&quot; treats plane and spherical trigonometry using Napier&#x27;s logarithms and a new nomenclature designed to facilitate memorization. Urquhart&#x27;s nomenclature resembles the names medieval schoolmen gave the various forms of syllogism, in which the construction of the name gives information about the thing being named. (Urquhart would make use of the same idea in his universal language.) The resulting effect is, however, bizarre, and the work is impenetrable without the investment of considerable time to learn Urquhart&#x27;s system. Although Urquhart was a formidable mathematician and &quot;Trissotetras&quot; mathematically sound, his approach has never been adopted and his book is a dead end in the history of mathematics.

; &quot;Pantochronachanon&quot; (1652) : Subtitled &quot;A peculiar promptuary of time,&quot; this work is a genealogy of the Urquhart family. In it, Urquhart manages to name each of his ancestors in an unbroken hereditary line from Adam and Eve all the way up to himself through 153 generations. This work has been the subject of ridicule since the time of its first publication, though it was likely an elaborate joke.

; &quot;The Jewel (Ekskybalauron)&quot; (1652) : A miscellaneous work. It contains a prospectus for Urquhart&#x27;s universal language, but most of the book is, as the title page says, &quot;a vindication of the honor of Scotland,&quot; including anecdotes about many Scottish soldiers and scholars. It includes Urquhart&#x27;s fictionalized life of the Scottish hero James Crichton (1560–82, &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;), Urquhart&#x27;s most celebrated work outside of his Rabelais; this section has sometimes been reprinted separately.

; &quot;Logopandecteision&quot; (1653) : This book contains another prospectus for Urquhart&#x27;s universal language. Although Urquhart does not give a vocabulary, he explains that his system would be based on a scheme in which the construction of words would reflect their meanings. &quot;Logopandecteision&quot; also contains a polemic against Urquhart&#x27;s creditors.

; &quot;The Works of Rabelais&quot; (Books I and II, 1653; Book III, 1693) : This is the work for which Urquhart is best known. It was described by the English author Charles Whibley, as &quot;the finest translation ever made from one language into another&quot; and a &quot;magnificent and unsurpassable translation&quot;, by the academic Roger Craik. There is a perfect match of temperament between author and translator. Urquhart&#x27;s learning, pedantry and word-mad exuberance proved to be ideal for Rabelais&#x27;s work. It is a somewhat free translation, but it never departs from the spirit of Rabelais. The third book was edited and completed by Peter Anthony Motteux and published after Urquhart&#x27;s death.

==Style==
Urquhart&#x27;s prose style is unique. His sentences are long and elaborate, and his love of the odd and recondite word seems boundless. At its worst his style can descend into almost unintelligible pretension and pedantry (&quot;a pedantry which is gigantesque and almost incredible&quot;, in the words of George Saintsbury), but at its best it can be rich, rapid and vivid, with arresting and original imagery. He coined words constantly, although none of Urquhart&#x27;s coinages have fared as well as those of his contemporary Browne.

==Popular culture==
Urquhart appears as the protagonist of Alasdair Gray&#x27;s short story &quot;Sir Thomas&#x27;s Logopandocy&quot; (included in &quot;Unlikely Stories, Mostly&quot;), the title taken from Urquhart&#x27;s &quot;Logopandecteision&quot;. Urquhart appears in the illustrations throughout &quot;Unlikely Stories&quot;.

Urquhart appears as a major character in the novel &quot;A Hand-book of Volapük&quot; by Andrew Drummond. Urquhart&#x27;s language proposal &quot;The Jewel&quot; as well as Volapük, Esperanto, and other constructed languages are prominent plot devices in the novel.

One of the characters in Robertson Davies&#x27; &quot;The Cornish Trilogy,&quot; Urquhart McVarish, claims to be a descendant of Urquhart.

<text>Gong was a title of ancient and imperial Chinese nobility roughly equivalent to and usually translated as duke. It was also historically used within Chinese fiefs as a respectful term of address to any living liege (similar to the English &quot;lord&quot;) and is still used in modern Chinese as a respectful term of address for any man of high status (similar to &quot;sir&quot;), particularly for the honored deceased as with formal reference to Chiang Kai-shek as &quot;Jiǎng Gōng&quot; () in Taiwan.

==Name==
Within the Chinese language, the same character (&quot;gōng&quot;) is used as a noun in the terms for respected male relatives (e.g. &quot;lǎogōng&quot;, &quot;husband&quot;, and &quot;wàigōng&quot;, &quot;maternal grandfather&quot;) and as an adjective in the terms for various male animals (e.g. &quot;gōngniú&quot;, &quot;bull&quot;, and &quot;gōngyáng&quot;, &quot;ram&quot; or &quot;billy goat&quot;). Paul R. Goldin has argued for its etymological relationship with (&quot;wēng&quot;), with their shared original term having meant &quot;respected elder&quot;.

The typical English translation within aristocratic ancient and imperial Chinese contexts is &quot;duke&quot;, although Creel has proposed translating it under the Western Zhou as &quot;lord&quot; and as &quot;duke&quot; only beginning with the Eastern Zhou.

==History==

By the time of the Zhou dynasty, the title gong was used alongside other familial titles for important members of the royal Ji family outside the immediate line of succession. The regents of the Cheng Kinghis uncles Dan and Shi and the important vassal Lü Shangwere known to history as Zhou Gong, Shao Gong, and Jiang Ziya. His uncles Xian, Du, and Chu who acted as the &quot;Three Guards&quot; of the eastern territories before their rebellion against the regency were likewise known by the somewhat lower rank of &quot;shū&quot; (), now used for younger paternal uncles or male friends of the family.

Subsequently, the Three Excellencies, the highest Zhou government ministers, bore the title gong, as did the highest ranking rulers of the kingdom&#x27;s fiefs even whenlike the Shang rulers of Songthey came from outside the royal family. The Xiang Duke of Song (r. 650–637 BC) even became one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn period, before such lords began to use the title of king. During the rites of ancestral veneration, any ancestor of great antiquity could be accorded the title gong regardless of their proper title in life; this was sometimes a formal upgrade, as when Jiang Ziya&#x27;s fief of Qi became a duchy and he was posthumously promoted to the title of gong himself. The name was also used by courtiers and others to address ruling nobles of any formal rank within their own states.

Under the Han and subsequent dynasties, wangpreviously the royal title of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou sovereignscame to be used for senior princes and vassal rulers who controlled the more important primary divisions of the empire. At this time, gong came into use for nominal or actual lords of its more important secondary divisions.

With the rise of notional titles, some of the dukedoms acquired literary rather than territorial designations. The primary example is how, under the Northern Song, the emperor Renzong made the title Duke Yansheng&quot;Overflowing with Wisdom&quot;hereditary within the line of direct descent from Confucius. This was converted to a cabinet-level political office of the Republic of China in 1935 and an uncompensated honorary title on Taiwan in 2008.

<text>Acteonidae, common name the &quot;barrel bubble snails&quot;, is a family of small sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks of the informal group Lower Heterobranchia.

==Shell description==
The shell is usually smaller than 25 mm. The shell of these sand-dwelling micromollusks is small, but it is large enough to house the retracted soft parts including the entire mantle.

The aperture is elongated. The narrow shell aperture, which is ovate and pointed on the top, can be closed with a corneous operculum.

The thick shell is oviform to , with a short (sometimes sunken) conical apex. They have spiral sculpturing. The elongated aperture opens up from narrow at the posterior notch to enlarged at the base. The base of the columella has several characteristic plaits.

==Anatomy==
The radula has no central tooth, and there are five or six laterals on each side. The teeth are very similar in shape and size across the radula, which is specialised for a diet of polychaete worms.

The eggs are enclosed in a long, gelatinous mass, which is attached to the substrate with a short stalk.

The foot is with operculum.

== Ecology ==
Acteonidae occur in warm seas in shallow and deep water.

Animals predate polychaetes.

==Genera==

<doc id="734840" wikidata="Q280888" url="?curid=734840" title="California State Route 138">
<text>State Route 138 (SR 138) is an east–west state highway in the U.S. state of California that generally follows the northern foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and the western Mojave Desert. The scenic highway begins in the west at its junction with Interstate 5 located south of Gorman in the Sierra Pelona Mountains, continues eastward through the Antelope Valley and Cajon Pass, to its junction with State Route 18 in the east, located in the San Bernardino Mountains south of Crestline.

Except for the western of the route between Interstate 5 and just east of Gorman Post Road and a segment shared with State Route 14 between Avenue D in Lancaster and Palmdale Boulevard in Palmdale, it is all a mostly undivided two-lane surface road. The remaining section of the Ridge Route, California&#x27;s first highway connecting the San Joaquin Valley to the Los Angeles Basin, ends at Route 138 near Gorman.

==Route description==
The western leg of State Route 138 traverses the Lancaster Freeway from Interstate 5 to Gorman Post Road, Lancaster Road from Gorman Post Road to 245th Street West near Neenach School, and Avenue D from 245th Street West to Route 138&#x27;s north junction with State Route 14. The Lancaster Freeway has four lanes, two for each direction of travel. Both Lancaster Road and Avenue D are 2-lane conventional roads; Avenue D is on a straight alignment over its between 245th Street West and State Route 14.

After its co-routing with the Antelope Valley Freeway (SR 14) for approximately through Lancaster and Palmdale, it passes through Palmdale&#x27;s eastside as four-lane Palmdale Boulevard, 47th Street East, and Fort Tejon Road to Avenue T. At Avenue T it tapers to two lanes and continues straight ahead on Pearblossom Highway through Littlerock, Pearblossom, and Llano to its west junction with State Route 18. Route 18&#x27;s western terminus siphons off Las Vegas-bound travelers from 138. At its west junction with State Route 18, State Route 138 turns southeast on Antelope Highway to the Los Angeles/San Bernardino County line where it loses its alternative name, Antelope Highway.

Between the county line and Interstate 15, State Route 138 traverses very mountainous and scenic terrain and it connects with State Route 2 that leads to winter resort areas in the San Gabriel Mountains used largely by residents of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. State Route 138 then descends through the West Cajon Valley and crosses Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass. From Interstate 15 to State Route 173, near the northwest corner of Silverwood Lake, traffic on State Route 138 is rather sparse. The remaining road past Silverwood Lake is mountainous, narrow, and twisting, and not a prime mountain route to the San Bernardino Mountain resorts. The entire segment from Interstate 15 to the eastern terminus of State Route 138 at Mount Anderson Junction is known as the El Cajon-Skyline Forest Highway. State Route 138 and 18 overlap each other in opposing termini, as SR 18&#x27;s northwest most endpoint is in Llano with SR 138, while SR 138&#x27;s southmost point is in Crestline with SR 18.

Because of its twisting, mountainous segments and overloaded traffic conditions on its eastern leg, State Route 138 east of Palmdale and west of Interstate 15 is the site of numerous serious auto accidents as of 2004, according to CHP data. One of the chief contributors to accidents on Route 138 of late is drivers passing on the two-lane highway in unsafe conditions. A notable accident in 2003 involved a pickup truck driven by an unlicensed driver leaving the roadway and plunging into the California Aqueduct, killing four occupants of the vehicle and leaving the sole survivor quadriplegic. The State of California paid a $10 million settlement to the victims&#x27; family. The area surrounding the highway is also prone to brush fires and flash floods.

SR 138 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and west of the western junction of SR 18 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 138 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.

The segment of SR 138 from I-15 in the Cajon Pass to SR 18 at Crestline is designated as part of the Rim of the World Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway.

==Future==
A project to widen the highway to four lanes and add shoulders between Avenue T in Palmdale and Highway 18 in Llano was announced by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) in 2009. Work was projected to be completed by Spring 2012. However, as of December 2012, work on the project was still ongoing and several portions remain two lanes. Improvements to the stretch between Highway 18 and the Los Angeles/San Bernardino County Line, including widening the shoulders and installing rumble strips, were proposed in February 2013, with no timeline for completion being given.

A proposed bypass to the north of downtown Palmdale has been studied by Caltrans. The bypass would be located east of the Antelope Valley Freeway and south of LA/Palmdale Regional Airport along Avenue P-8, reconnecting with the current SR 138 east of Palmdale.

Caltrans developed a plan to build a freeway and transit corridor parallel to State Route 138 and State Route 18, known as the &quot;High Desert Corridor&quot;. The $8 billion project would have included an eight-lane freeway between Lancaster and Victorville, along with a bikeway, rapid transit, and part of Brightline West, a proposed high-speed rail line linking Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Caltrans put the freeway on hold in 2019.

==Major intersections==











==In popular culture==
Parts of the distinctive highway were used in the filming of the movie &quot;The Long, Long Trailer&quot;, a 1954 comedy with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Despite the rapid growth of Southern California in the ensuing fifty years, the segment shown in the movie is little changed since the movie was filmed.

David Hockney composed the picturesque photographic collage &quot;Pearblossom Highway in 1986&quot; off the segment of Route 138 bearing that moniker. It may be viewed at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

<doc id="734841" wikidata="Q314865" url="?curid=734841" title="Darius Vassell">
<text>Darius Martin Clarke Vassell (born 13 June 1980) is an English former professional footballer who played as a forward for Aston Villa, Manchester City, Ankaragücü and Leicester City.

Vassell began his career at his home town club Aston Villa in the Premier League, being developed by their academy and making his first team debut in 1998. He was sold for £2 million in 2005 to another Premier League club, Manchester City, staying for four seasons before being released in 2009, moving abroad to Turkey for a season to play for the Süper Lig team Ankaragücü. In October 2010 he was brought back to England by his former international manager Sven-Göran Eriksson to play for the Championship side Leicester City.

Under Eriksson with England, Vassell scored six goals from 22 international caps awarded between 2002 and 2004, including appearances at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, and UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Vassell was born in Birmingham, West Midlands. He was raised in the Gravelly Hill area of Birmingham and went to the Yenton Primary School in Erdington and John Willmott School, in Falcon Lodge, Sutton Coldfield. He first played football with local junior team Romulus in the Birmingham Boys League scoring a record of 46 in a season and 6 in 1 match. Following this he signed for the Aston Villa youth team.

===Aston Villa===
An Aston Villa fan, Vassell was taken on by the club&#x27;s School of Excellence. While playing for the club&#x27;s youth team Vassell set a club record by scoring 39 goals in a single season. He made his first team debut as a substitute in a 3–1 win against Middlesbrough in August 1998.

Vassell&#x27;s best qualities were his speed and agility. Aston Villa fans lamented the fact that his best performances seem to come with England, where he has proved particularly useful as a &quot;super sub&quot;, coming on for the last 15 to 20 minutes of a game to trouble a tired defence with his exceptional pace. One oddity of his career was that he had never finished on the losing side in a league game in which he had scored. This run ended on 22 April 2011 when he scored for Leicester City during the 3–2 defeat to Nottingham Forest.

===Manchester City===

Vassell was transferred to Manchester City in July 2005 for £2 million. During his first season for Manchester City, Vassell scored eight league goals in 35 appearances, forming an effective partnership with Andy Cole. Additionally, he helped the Blues to an FA Cup Quarter Final, scoring two goals in his five cup games. He played part of the season with a hernia problem, which required surgery in the close season.

In the 2007–08 season, he was assigned the number 12, as teammate Elano took the number 11 shirt. He generally struggled to find his best form. In the latter half of the season, many of his appearances were as a wide midfielder, as manager Sven-Göran Eriksson adopted a defensive 4–5–1 formation. Vassell was linked with a move away from Eastlands, with Turkish runners-up Besiktas having a £1m bid rejected and linked to other clubs, including Premier League rivals Bolton Wanderers and newly promoted Derby County. Vassell scored his 50th Premier League goal on 10 February 2008, in the victory against local rivals Manchester United. Vassell only played 15 games in 2008–09 and was released at the end of the season as his contract expired.

===Ankaragücü===
In July 2009 Vassell signed for the Turkish side Ankaragücü.
Around 3,000 fans turned out and celebrated his arrival. He scored his first goal in the Turkish Süper Lig against Manisaspor in the second week of the season. He parted company with the club at the end of the 2009–10 season.

===Leicester City===
On 20 October 2010, Vassell signed for English side Leicester City on a two-year deal until the end of 2011–12 season, reuniting him with his former Manchester City and England manager Eriksson. He scored his first goal for Leicester in a 5–1 win over Doncaster Rovers on 11 December.

On 29 October 2011, he suffered a serious knee injury in a game against West Ham United which ruled him out for the rest of the season. The injury was a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament. Vassell left the club on 30 June after not being offered a new contract.

Vassell remained without a club until his retirement on 28 January 2016, at the age of 35.

==International career==
Vassell made his England debut on 13 February 2002, in a man of the match performance against Netherlands in a 1–1 draw. Fellow debutants in this game were Michael Ricketts and Wayne Bridge. He scored in the game with a 60th-minute bicycle kick to equalise. He was subsequently included in England&#x27;s 2002 World Cup campaign. He played in three games, starting just one: against Sweden in England&#x27;s opening group game.

Vassell missed in the penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals of Euro 2004 against hosts Portugal. Coming on for the injured Wayne Rooney early on in the game, he missed England&#x27;s last spot-kick in the penalty shoot-out, allowing Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo to knock England out of the tournament by scoring the final penalty. Vassell did not play for England again.

==Coaching career==
As of August 2024, Vassell was working with the England U18 squad.

==Personal life==
Vassell was born to Jamaican parents and is a practising Christian. He credits his faith for his survival of a serious car accident. He is married to Amani Rodriquez-Thomas, they have a daughter named Persia; Vassell&#x27;s 2017 autobiography &quot;Road to Persia&quot; was titled for her. He is also a cousin of Kilmarnock F.C. forward Kyle Vassell and former Cardiff City F.C. forward Isaac Vassell

<doc id="734843" wikidata="Q6772545" url="?curid=734843" title="Marquess of Hastings">
<text>Marquess of Hastings was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 6 December 1816 for Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Earl of Moira.
==History==
The Rawdon family descended from Francis Rawdon (d. 1668), of Rawdon, Yorkshire. His son Sir George Rawdon, 1st Baronet settled in the village of Moira, County Down. His son, the second Baronet, and grandson, the third Baronet, both represented County Down in the Irish House of Commons. The latter was succeeded by his son, Sir John Rawdon, 4th Baronet. He was created Baron Rawdon, of Moira in the County of Down, in 1750, and Earl of Moira in 1762. Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Moira married as his third wife Elizabeth Hastings, 12th Baroness Hastings, 16th Baroness Botreaux, 11th Baroness Hungerford and 10th Baroness de Moleyns, daughter of Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon. Their son Francis Rawdon was a prominent soldier and colonial administrator. He was created Baron Rawdon, of Rawdon, in the County of York, in his own right in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1783, ten years before inheriting the earldom from his father. He assumed the additional surname of Hastings in 1789 in accordance with the will of his uncle Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon. In 1808 he succeeded his mother in the baronies of Hastings, Botreaux, Hungerford and de Moleyns. In 1816 he was created Viscount Loudoun, Earl of Rawdon and Marquess of Hastings in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Hastings married Flora Mure-Campbell, 6th Countess of Loudoun.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Marquess. In 1840 he also succeeded his mother in the earldom of Loudoun. Lord Hastings married Barbara Yelverton, 20th Baroness Grey de Ruthyn. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Marquess. He died aged only seventeen and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Marquess. In 1858 he also succeeded his mother as 21st Baron Grey de Ruthyn. Lord Hastings died childless in 1868. On his death the baronetcy of Moira, baronies of Rawdon, viscountcy of Loudoun, earldoms of Moira and Rawdon and marquessate of Hastings became extinct. The Scottish earldom of Loudoun was passed on to his eldest sister Edith Rawdon-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun (see Earl of Loudoun for further history of this title). The baronies of Botreaux, Hungerford, de Moleyns, Hastings and Grey de Ruthyn fell into abeyance between his sisters. The baronies of Botreaux, Hastings of Hungerford, de Moleyns, Hastings were called out of abeyance in 1871 in favour of Lord Hastings&#x27;s eldest sister, the aforementioned Edith Rawdon-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun, while the barony of Grey de Ruthyn was called out of abeyance the same year in favour of his second sister Bertha, 22nd Baroness Grey de Ruthyn (see the Baron Grey de Ruthyn for further history of this title).

Edith and the 4th Marquess were children of the 2nd Marquess.&quot;

<text>Kenneth Livingstone Campbell (January 15, 1934 – August 28, 2006) was a Canadian fundamentalist Baptist evangelist and political figure. He was the final leader of the Social Credit Party of Canada from 1990 to 1993.

==Opposition to abortion and homosexuality==
He became prominent in the Toronto area in the 1970s as a critic of Gay rights and as a pro-life advocate, founding Renaissance Canada in 1974 to promote his views, particularly in education. He held frequent rallies against gay rights and regularly took out full page ads in newspapers, campaigning against gay rights and secular humanism. Many such ads were printed following court decisions on gay rights, such as the 1998 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Vriend v. Alberta&quot;. 

In 1979, outside the Toronto mayor&#x27;s office, Campbell organized a protest rally against the LGBTQ publication &quot;The Body Politic&quot; alongside Christian television talk-show host David Mainse in response to an article it had published by Gerald Hannon in the December 1977/January 1978 issue (reprinted in March/April 1979) entitled &quot;Men Loving Boys Loving Men.&quot; While being interviewed by the media during the rally, Campbell stated, &quot;when a group advocates the molestation of children one has to question the social constructive nature of the whole cause they represent.&quot; 

In 1980, Campbell published a book, &quot;No Small Stir: A Spiritual Strategy for Salting and Saving a Secular Society&quot;, with a forward from Jerry Falwell.

==Political career==
Campbell ran in elections at all levels in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly in the provincial riding of St. George—St. David, which included the centre of Toronto&#x27;s gay community clustered around Church and Wellesley streets. In 1984, following the acquittal of Henry Morgentaler, he founded a group called &quot;Choose Life Canada&quot; which picketed abortion clinics in Toronto and other Ontario cities. On one occasion, he attempted to conduct a &quot;citizen&#x27;s arrest&quot; against provincial Attorney General Ian Scott, after Scott refused to shut down an abortion clinic run by Morgentaler. Campbell later ran against Scott in St. George—St. David as a candidate of the Family Coalition Party in the 1990 provincial election. He campaigned as a fringe candidate for Mayor of Toronto the following year, but urged voters to support June Rowlands rather than himself to prevent Jack Layton from winning.

He once ran for mayor of Milton, Ontario against long-time mayor Gordon Krantz to protest having to pay the education portion of his municipal property taxes. Campbell refused to pay on the basis that he disagreed with the school curriculum. 

Campbell sent Krantz a letter during the campaign, saying that if he were elected, he would be too busy to be mayor so he would &quot;deputize&quot; Krantz and have him do the job.

Campbell took over the near-moribund Social Credit Party of Canada in 1990, and ran in a by-election in Oshawa placing eighth, with 96 votes. Under Campbell, the party began to re-embrace traditional social credit theory after years of moving away from it. He began the process of renaming the party as the Christian Freedom Party. While it was still registered under the Social Credit name, he used the &quot;Christian Freedom&quot; name in most of his speeches. 

However, the party was only able to field 10 candidates for the 1993 election—well short of the 50 required for a party to keep its registration—and was deregistered by Elections Canada in October 1993. 

As a result, Campbell was forced to run as an independent, finishing last in a field of six candidates in Oakville. He ran a final time, again as an independent, in a 1996 federal by-election in Hamilton East, finishing in fifth place with 287 votes.

After being deregistered, the party continued as an incorporated non-profit entity known as the &quot;Social Credit Party of Canada, Incorporated&quot;. Campbell occasionally used it as a podium for his political activities in order to preserve his church&#x27;s status as a religious charity.

==Life after politics==
On June 12, 1999, Ken Campbell presented a workshop at the Media Ministry Conference held in conjunction with Tyndale University College &amp; Seminary&#x27;s Tyndale Arts, Media and Music Conference in Toronto, Ontario. For a number of years, Campbell hosted a daily Christian evangelical radio show on CJMR in Mississauga. 

In 1999, he protested a same-sex wedding ceremony at Brent Hawkes&#x27;s Metropolitan Community Church. In around 2000, while recovering from prostate cancer, Campbell moved himself and his ministry from Ontario to the interior of British Columbia.

In 2003, Campbell claimed that Toronto&#x27;s SARS epidemic would cease when the city ended its Gay Pride Parade (which he described as an &quot;AIDS Parade&quot;).

Predeceased by his wife Norma, who died in January 2006, Ken Campbell succumbed to cancer on August 28, 2006, aged 72, while receiving palliative care in a Delta, British Columbia hospital.

<text>The Shanghai Metro (; Shanghainese: &quot;Zaon6he5 Di6thiq7&quot;) is a rapid transit system in Shanghai, operating urban and suburban transit services to 14 of its 16 municipal districts and to the neighboring township of Huaqiao, in Kunshan, Jiangsu Province.

Forming the vast majority of the broader, multi-operator Shanghai rail transit network, the Shanghai Metro system is the world&#x27;s longest metro system by route length, totaling and the second largest system by number of stations, with 508 stations across 20 lines. It also ranks first in the world by annual ridership, with 3.88 billion rides delivered in 2019. The last daily ridership record was set on 9 March 2024, at 13.39 million rides. Since the pandemic, ridership still routinely stands at over 10 million on an average workday, accounting for 73% of trips on public transport in the city.

== History ==


Opening to the public in 1993 with full-scale construction extending back to 1986, the Shanghai Metro is the third-oldest rapid transit system in mainland China, after the Beijing Subway and the Tianjin Metro. Though actual construction and inauguration of the Shanghai Metro succeeded its counterparts in Beijing and Tianjin, their initial planning would date back to the same period, during the late 50s and early 60s, before the impact of the Cultural Revolution.

The system saw its most rapid expansion during the years leading up to the 2010 World Expo, namely, between 2003 and 2010. Between 2007 and 2010, it was customary for new lines and extensions to open on an annual basis. The system is still expanding, with the most recent expansions opening in early 2024, and several new lines and extensions under construction.

===1950-1965: Proposals and early groundbreaking===

The first proposal of a subway system for Shanghai dates back to the year 1950. Against the backdrop of the air raids of Shanghai by the retreating Nationalist forces in that year, a team of Soviet technical specialists visiting the city made a proposal to the Municipal Committee on Urban Planning and Design for a dual-purpose underground railway system, to be used for mass transit during peace times, and as shelter facility in times of war. It was later, in 1953, during confidential consultations held with Soviet urban planning specialists by Li Gancheng, the then-Deputy Chief and Party Secretary of the Municipal Construction Committee in Shanghai, that the initial concepts of a north-south line and an east-west line were pencilled on a map of the city, which would later become Line 1 and Line 2. Further consultations and public surveys on transit needs were held in 1959 by a Municipal Planning Committee for Underground Railway, in conjunction with the Municipal Public Utilities Management Bureau, and identified multiple alternative plans for a subway system.

In 1960, with a newly-formed a Bureau of Tunnel Engineering, the city undertook an experimental shield tunneling project in Tangqiao, Pudong, excavating a tunnel with a 4.2m-diameter shield for over 100 meters. Dubbed Project 60, this project was carried out in strict confidentiality. In August 1964, the Tunnel Engineering section of the Municipal Urban Construction Bureau completed the route selection phase for the north-south line (later Line 1), which was eventually to connect key locations in the downtown core, including the Shanghai Cultural Square, People&#x27;s Square and the then Shanghai North railway station, with the rapidly industrializing and urbanizing northern districts of Zhabei and Baoshan, including the industrial zone in Pengpu, the worker&#x27;s residential area in Zhangmiao, and the town of Wusong. It is ostensibly in this same period that, in 1965, another experimental project on underground tunnel and station construction was underway in a segment between Hengshan Park and Xiangyang Park, both in Xuhui. However, construction halted during the immediately subsequent Cultural Revolution period, and no systematic plan to build an underground railway system materialized.

===The 1980s: Renewed plans and initial construction of Line 1===

The economic reforms of 1980s and the rapidly increasing demand for efficient urban public transit saw a swift resurrection of plans for a rapid rail transit system in Shanghai. In 1983, a jointly-published &quot;Proposal on the Construction of a North-South Rapid Rail Transit Line&quot; by the Municipal Planning Committee, the Municipal Construction Committee, in collaboration with the Municipal Bureaus of Urban Planning, of Public Infrastructure, of Railways and of Public Works, called for a rail transit line to be built which connects the city center with Minhang and Jinshan in the south-southwest, and with Wusong and Baoshan in the north-northeast, clearly echoing the initial north-south line concept of the 1950s-60s, though couched in this period in terms of the City&#x27;s new master plan to &quot;develop both the north and the south wings.&quot; Subsequently, in August 1985, a Project Planning Report submitted to the Municipal Planning Committee and the Municipal Committee on Urban and Rural Construction and Management by the Preparation Working Group on the North–South Rapid Rail Transit Line prioritizes the Xinlonghua-to-New railway station segment, and makes a conclusive case for the route of the previously-indeterminate middle segment of the line to be placed under Huaihai Road. Thus, the first stage of the first underground railway line, later Line 1, was determined.

Formal central government-level approval of both the construction of Line 1 and a long-term system-wide plan for the Shanghai Metro came in 1986. In that year, the State Council approved the Master City Plan of Shanghai (1983–2000), the first-ever such approval by the State Council in the history of Shanghai. Part of that Master Plan included a 40-year phased program that would eventually see the construction of 11 metro lines covering over 325 km by 2025. On August 14, 1986, the State Council approved the &quot;Proposal Concerning Construction of Shanghai City Subway Line from Xinlonghua Station to Shanghai Railway Station,&quot; clearing the pathway for the beginning of construction of Line 1.

===1993–2002: Inauguration and initial expansion===

The southern section of line 1 (four stations) opened on May 28, 1993. The full line (including middle and northern sections) eventually opened on April 10, 1995, and in the first year, it handled an average of 600,000 passengers daily. The first phase of line 2 was inaugurated in June 2000, which in 2010 linked Hongqiao International Airport (SHA) and Pudong International Airport (PVG). The 25 km Pearl line (line 3) opened for revenue service in 2001. Line 5 opened in 2003. Line 4 joined the network in January 2006 and became a circular line in 2007.

The Master Plan of Shanghai Metro-Region 1999–2020 was approved by the State Council of China on May 11, 2001. The plan had 17 lines in total, containing four intra-city-region express rail lines, eight urban metro lines, and five urban light-rail lines with a total length of about 780 kilometers. The total length of the planned MRT network in the central city will add up to 488 kilometers. In addition, Shanghai will strengthen the development of the suburban rail transport network so that it can link to and coordinate with state rail lines, metro lines, and light railways. One or two rail transport lines are planned between every new city and the central city.

===2003–2010: Rapid expansion for the Expo 2010===
In 2003 when the length was only 3 lines, 65 kilometers (with a further 5 lines already under construction), Shanghai was named host city for the World Expo 2010, plans were made to extend the length of the Metro to 400 kilometers by the time it opened in 2010. Thereby it completed the initial 40-year plan 15 years ahead of schedule.
During Expo 2010 the metro system consisted of 11 lines, 407 km, and 277 stations.

===2011–2021: Completion of a master plan===
In 2009 Shanghai announced it would have 21 lines operating by 2020 with lines extending further into the suburban areas. At the end of 2021 (expected), most of the lines of the plan were opened (with an exemption of line 20, Jiamin line, and Chongming line) leading to 19 lines (line 1-18 and Pujiang), 802 km, 516 stations.

On October 16, 2013, with the extension of line 11 into Kunshan in Jiangsu province (about 6.5 km), Shanghai Metro became the first rapid transit system in China to provide cross-provincial service and the second intercity metro after the Guangfo Metro.

===2021 onwards: Phase III construction===
The National Development and Reform Commission has approved the 2018-2023 construction plan for the city&#x27;s Metro network. The construction of five new metro lines (and two commuter rail lines) and two extensions to opened lines are expected to take five to six years and are planned to start construction before 2023. After completion, there will be 27 metro and commuter rail lines covering 1,154 kilometers.

With the Shanghai Master Plan, 2017-2035 more emphasis was put on other rail transit modes. The plan calls for a comprehensive transportation system that consists of multimodel rail transit. Intercity lines (intercity railway, municipality railway, and express railway), urban lines (subway and light rail), and local lines (modern tramcar, rubber-tired transit system) in a length of more than 1,000 km each.

By 2035, public transportation will account for over 50% of all means of transportation, and 60% of rail transit stations in the inner areas of the main city will have 600m of land coverage. According to the NDRC, the Shanghai Metro network (including commuter rail) will cover 1,642 kilometers in total by 2030 and more than 2,000 kilometers by 2035.

==Ridership==
Since 1993, the ridership of the entire network has grown as the new lines or sections come into operation. In 1995, the first year of operation, line 1 carried 62 million passengers (average daily passenger volume of 223,000). Ridership increased between 2011 and 2016 with 10% per annum, between 2017 and 2019 with 5%. The reduction in ridership in 2020 is due to COVID-19. Ridership recovered to close to pre-covid levels in 2021, with a ridership on December 31 of 13.014 million.

==Lines==
===In service===
There are currently 19 lines in operation, with lines and services denoted numerically as well as by characteristic colors, which are used as a visual aid for better distinction on station signage and on the exterior of trains, in the form of a colored block or belt.

Most tracks in the Shanghai Metro system are served by a single service; thus &quot;Line X&quot; usually refers to both the physical line and its service. The only exception is the segment shared by lines 3 and 4, between Hongqiao Road station and Baoshan Road station, where both services use the same tracks and platforms.


===Future expansion===
The Shanghai Metro system is one of the fastest-growing metro systems in the world. Ambitious expansion plans call for 25 lines with over of length by 2025. By then, every location in the central area of Shanghai will be within of a subway station. Shanghai metro is connected with the metro system of Suzhou Rail Transit; the Suzhou Rail Transit line 11 connects Shanghai Metro line 11 with Suzhou Rail Transit line 3.


==Infrastructure==
===Rolling stock===
There are currently over 7,000 railcars in the Shanghai metro system. The train fleet reached 1,000 cars in 2007, 2,000 cars in 2012, and 3,000 cars in 2016, the 4,000th car was delivered on December 17, 2016, the 5,000th car was delivered on July 20, 2018. The 7,000th car was delivered on December 25, 2020.
Most lines currently use semi-automatic train operations (STO/GoA2). Starting and stopping are automated, but a driver operates the doors, drives the train if needed and handles emergencies. The exceptions being:
* Lines 2, 5 and 17: Driverless train operations (DTO/GoA3) train attendant operates the doors and drives the train in case of emergencies.
* Lines 10, 14, 15, 18 and Pujiang line: Unattended train operations (UTO/GoA4) starting and stopping, operation of doors are all fully automated without any on-train staff. With a total length of 169 km it is the world&#x27;s 2nd largest fully automated metro system, after the Singapore MRT.

Most lines currently use 6 car sets, with the exceptions being:
* The Minhang Developing Zone branch of line 5, line 6 and Pujiang line, which uses 4 car sets.
* Most trains on line 8 use 7 car sets.
* Lines 1, 2 and 14 use 8 car sets.

On most lines the maximum operating speed is , with the exceptions being:
* Lines 11 and 17 the maximum operating speed is .
* Line 16 the maximum operating speed is .

Pujiang line is the only line using cars with rubber tires running on concrete tracks.

All subway cars have air-conditioning. During summer of 2021 the subway&#x27;s first and last carriages on Metro lines 3-5, 10-13, and 15-18 will be 2 degrees Celsius warmer than the other carriages, the air-conditioning is adjustable for different carriages on these lines. The measure aims to address the needs of some passengers who find the trains &quot;too cold,&quot; especially the elderly and children.

===Platform screen doors===

Almost all stations have (full height) platform screen doors with sliding acrylic glass at the platform edge. Only half height doors called automatic platform gates are placed at most of the elevated sections and the section of line 2 from Songhong Road to Longyang Road. The train stops with its doors lined-up with the sliding doors on the platform edge and open when the train doors open, and are closed at other times.

During construction of the early lines conditions were reserved for the installation of platform screen doors but not installed, due to cost considerations and no domestic companies making them at the time. In the early 2000s, before the screen doors were installed, the annual suicide rate on the Shanghai subway system averaged about eight. In 2003 Shanghai Metro Operation Technology Development Co., Ltd. developed domestically platform screen doors with costs only 40% of imported platform screen doors (they cost over RMB6 million each to install). , opened December 28, 2004, was the first station to have installed platform screen doors. To help cope with passenger handling, platform safety doors were built for line 4 onwards and a program for retrofitting older lines was put in place. The retrofitting on existing lines started in November 2005 with line 1 (first station was ) whose core stations had doors by the end of 2006. Originally, platform screen doors were adopted to prevent cool or hot air from leaving the station to reduce electricity usage.

===Renewable energy===
Shanghai metro started building solar plants from 2013 and the process has been accelerated since 2019, with plans to build rooftop solar plants with a total electricity generation capacity of 30 to 50 megawatts between 2021 and 2025. In 2021 it owned through it subsidiary Shanghai Metro New Energy Co., Ltd. ten rooftop solar plants on depots and parking lots (Chuanyanghe, Zhibei, Jinqiao, Longyang Road, Sanlin, Fujin Road, Zhongchun Road, Beizhai Road, Chentai Road and Pujiang Town) generating an average annual power generation of about 23 million kwh. Annual electricity consumption of Shanghai Metro exceeds 2.5 billion kWh.

==Stations==
There is cellular phone network coverage across the network. In 2020, all stations provided 5G network coverage. Free WiFi is also provided. There are toilets for passengers in more than 90% metro stations in Shanghai. The system is 100% wheelchair accessible, with elevators at all stations.

===Safety===
Riders are subject to searches of their persons and belongings at all stations by security inspectors using metal detectors, X-ray machines. Items banned from public transportation such as &quot;guns, ammunition, knives, explosives, flammable and radioactive materials, and toxic chemicals&quot; are subject to confiscation.

Stations are equipped with closed-circuit television. Police use it to arrest pickpockets caught on CCTV, for example.

Smoking is strictly prohibited in the metro premises. Bicycles (including folding bikes) and pets (including cats, dogs etc.) are not allowed in stations. The use of skateboards, roller skates and other equipment is not allowed in stations and carriages.

Since April 1, 2020, there is a national ban on &quot;Uncivilized Behavior&quot; on China&#x27;s Subways, which also includes conduct rules cracking down on bad subway etiquette, such as stepping on seats, lying down on a bench or floor and playing music or videos out loud. It also bans eating and drinking on subway cars nationwide, with exceptions for infants and people with certain medical conditions.

First AEDs (automatic external defibrillator) were installed at Metro stations in 2015, with all metro stations having AEDs at the end of 2021.

===Passenger information systems===
Plasma screens on the platforms show passengers when the next two trains are coming, along with advertisements and public service announcements. The subway cars contain LCD screens showing advertisements and on some lines, the next stop, while above-ground trains have LED screens showing the next stop. The LED screens are being phased in on line 1 and are also included in lines 7 and 9, two underground lines.

Station signs are in Simplified Chinese and English. There are recorded messages stating the next stop in Mandarin, English, and (on lines 16 and 17 only) Shanghainese, but the messages stating nearby attractions or shops for a given station (a form of paid advertising) are in Mandarin only. The metro operating company is resistant to expanding use of Shanghainese for announcing stops, on the basis that, on most lines, the majority of passengers can understand either Mandarin or English.

The Metro authority has tested a new systematic numbering system for stations on line 10, but did not extend it to other lines.

On December 31, 2009, Shanghai launched a website displaying real-time comprehensive passenger flow information, each station and line is displayed as either green (normal operation), yellow (crowded), and red (suspended/not in operation).

==Operations==
===Short turn service patterns===
Short turn service patterns exist on all lines except line 16. Partial services serve only a (usually busier) sub-segment of the entire physical line.

Line 11, one of the three branch lines of the metro system, operates a different short turn service pattern. Trains traveling to and from the branch line terminate at Huaqiao Station and Sanlin respectively. Hence, a passenger who wants to travel from the terminus of the branch to Disney Resort, the eastern terminus of the line, must change trains.

===Express services===
Line 16, unlike the rest of the system, is built with passing loops and operates express and rapid services. The service was postponed on January 30, 2014, due to lack of available trains, but resumed on March 21, 2016.

===Operating hours and train intervals===
The operating hours for most Shanghai metro stations starts between 5:00 to 6:00 in the morning and ends between 22:30 to 23:00 CST. The current timetable is available on the Shanghai metro website.

The interval of trains during peak hours differ between 1 minutes and 50 seconds on line 9 and 6 minutes on line 18. Lines in the inner sections have train intervals under three minutes during morning peak hours and under 3 minutes and 45 seconds during evening peak hour. The more suburban outer sections, outside peak hours train intervals are longer.

====Extended hours on Friday and Saturday====
On lines in the city center on Fridays and Saturdays, operating hours are extended by an additional hour.
From April 1, 2017, the operating hours of lines 1, 2, and 7-10 were extended by an hour after the regular last train on each Friday, Saturday and the last working days before Chinese Public Holidays. Since July 1, 2017, this was extended such that lines 1-4 and 5-13. By the end of 2018, all the stations in the city center extended their operating hours after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.
Since September 30, 2020, extended operation was resumed on lines 1, 2, 9 and 10. Since April 30, 2021, also extended weekend operation of lines 7 and 13 was resumed.

====Extra trains from Hongqiao railway station====
From Sunday to Thursday, there are two trains on both line 2 and 10 taking passengers from Hongqiao railway station and airport after normal operation time and only stop at selected stations.

===Owners and operators===
==Fares and ticket system==

Like many other metro systems in the world, Shanghai Metro uses a distance-based fare system. The system uses a &quot;one-ticket network&quot;, which means that interchanging is possible between all interchange stations, given that the transfer staying within the Shanghai Metro system, without the purchase of another ticket where available, excluding some stations where transferring to another line at said station requires leaving the Fare Zone which mandates a Single-Journey Ticket be used before entering that of another line, requiring the purchase of another Single-Journey Ticket (Shanghai Public Transport Cards are exempt as they are not consumed upon exit). The Shanghai Public Transport Card, which allows access to most public transport in Shanghai under one card, is another form of payment.

All stations are equipped with Shanghai public transport card self-service recharge machines, some of which support card sales and card refund operations. Passengers can also choose to purchase public transport cards to travel.
Since 2005 automatic ticket vending machine, which accepted banknotes, appeared in Shanghai Metro stations. Automatic ticket vending machines are divided into &quot;coins only&quot; and &quot;coins and banknotes are collected&quot;, the coin only machine collects 1 yuan and 0.5 yuan, and the coins and banknotes all accept 5, 10, 20, and 50 yuan banknotes and 1 and, 0.5 yuan coins. Vending machines will provide change.

===Children under 1.3 meters===
One or two children not taller than 1.3 meters (inclusive) are exempted from paying a fare in accompany of another passenger. In cases of more than two, the passenger should buy tickets. A preschool child, unattended by an adult, is not allowed to take the train alone.

===Periodic pass===
A pass for unlimited travel within the metro system for either 24 or 72 hours is offered. This pass is not available through vending machines, but has to be purchased at Service Centers at metro stations.

* A one-day pass priced at 18 yuan. This pass was introduced on April 24, 2010, for the Expo 2010 held in Shanghai.
* A three-day pass priced at 45 yuan. This pass was available since March 8, 2012.
* A Maglev single trip ticket and metro ticket priced at 55 yuan. This pass allows for a ride on the Shanghai Maglev Train and unlimited travel within the metro system for 24 hours. A Maglev round trip and metro ticket is priced at 85 yuan.

===Distance-based fare===
* The base fare is 3 yuan (RMB) for journeys under 6 km, then 1 yuan for each additional 10 km. As of December 2017, the highest fare is 15 yuan (travel between Oriental Land to Dishui Lake, the farthest distance at present). This fare scheme has not changed since September 15, 2005.

* Shortest route calculated as multiple route available between any entry-exit stations.
* Travel time limit is 4 hour. Additional lowest single journey fare (3 yuan) is required if time limit is exceeded.
* For journeys exclusively from Xinzhuang Station to People&#x27;s Square Station, the fare is 4 yuan, though the distance between People&#x27;s Square Station and Xinzhuang Station is about .

Only passengers with unused tickets at the station on the day can refund tickets at the service center. Refunds can also be processed in the event of a train failure for more than 15 minutes, and the apology letter can be downloaded on the official website, WeChat public account and Metropolis app.

====Single-Journey Ticket====

Single-Journey tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines, and at some stations, at a ticket window. Single-ride tickets are embedded with RFID contactless chips. When entering the system riders tap the ticket against a scanner above the turnstile, and when they exit they insert the ticket into a slot where it is stored and recycled. This ticket does not facilitate transfers at a virtual interchange station. Passengers would have to purchase a new ticket when reentering the fare gate.

====Public transportation card====

In addition to a single-ride ticket, the fare can be paid using a Shanghai public transport card. Transportation card of other cities that utilizes China T-Union can also be used in Shanghai Metro. This RFID-embedded card can be purchased at selected banks, convenience stores and metro stations with a 20-yuan deposit. This card can be loaded at ticket booths, Service Centers at the metro stations as well as many small convenience stores and banks throughout the city. The Shanghai Public Transportation Card can also be used to pay for other forms of transportation, such as taxi or bus. Refunds can be obtained at selected stations.

Discounts for SPTC holders:
* Cumulative discount: Users of the Shanghai public transport card or QR codes get a 10% discount for the rest of the calendar month after paying 70 yuan in taking metro, The discount is applied only for journeys after the payment; it is not retroactively applied to previous journeys.
* Virtual-transportation discount: Transfers at virtual interchange stations the fare will be calculated continuously. This discount is also applicable for T-Union transportation cards of other cities and Shanghai Public Transportation QR code.
* Combined ride discount: Users of the Shanghai public transport card and QR codes get a 1 yuan discount when transferring to the metro within 120 minutes. (The 10% monthly discount may be applied after the transfer discount.) This discount also applies for a bus to Metro and bus to bus transfers and can accumulate over multiple transfers. Depending on the time spent at the destination the discount will be applied at the start of the return trip as well, making the cost of a round-trip 11 yuan instead of the 16 yuan that would normally be charged without the card.

====Mobile payment methods====
Passengers can also pay their Shanghai Metro fares using a mobile phone app, Daduhui (Metro Metropolis) since January 2018. The app requires one to scan a QR code when entering the fare gate at the origin station and again when exiting at the destination station. The fare is then deducted. The system supports Alipay, WeChat Pay and Union Pay, three of the most commonly used mobile payment methods in China.

The Shanghai Public Transportation QR Code, which is accessible through Alipay, WeChat and other applications, has been accepted on the Shanghai Metro since 2022. The usage of the Shanghai Public Transportation QR Code does not require bluetooth. Furthermore, users of the aforementioned QR Code are entitled to the same fare discounts as users of a Shanghai Public Transportation Card.

=== Fare evasion ===
The official reported daily fare evasion rate accounts for about 0.16% of the total passenger flow. In the Shanghai Metro fare evasion will result in a fine of 6 times the fare.

Shanghai Metro have been cooperating with police to crack down on subway fare evasion. In 2012, the Shanghai Metro has reported 202,457 counts fare evasion, and an additional 472,898 yuan of adjusted fare was collected. Since June 3, 2013, the subway operator announced that all evaders will be recorded in the personal credit information system, which may lead to obstacles in loan applications and job hunting in the future. However, in actual implementation, the subway law enforcement officers only took the above measures for those who refused to make up the fare; and in some stations where fare evasion often occurred, the ticket gates were changed from the original three-bar type to gate type gates.

==Controversies and incidents==
===Class C cars===
In 1999, Shanghai Electric and Alstom Metropolis signed an agreement to invest 28 million US dollars to establish Shanghai Alstom Transportation Equipment Co., Ltd., and introduce a rail transit train production line in Minhang, which would be able to assemble 300 trains annually. Shanghai Alstom only had the national license to produce C-class cars from its establishment and no license to produce A-class cars. At that time, the municipal government stipulated that Shanghai would purchase 300 C cars produced by the new company on lines 5, 6, and 8 of the future rail transit construction. The two parties reached an agreement on the purchase of 300 cars at that time. For this reason, the Transportation Research Institute had to &quot;reduce&quot; the predicted passenger flow to accommodate the C-class railcars, allowing for a reduction of the station&#x27;s civil construction scope for the smaller trains. In the construction of lines 5, 6, and 8, the railcars were not supplied by the completion of the tender, but by a signed agreement for the railcars after &quot;internal consultation and coordination&quot; between Shentong Group and Shanghai Alstom, a violation of Articles 3 and 4 of the Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on Tendering and Bidding.

The person in charge of the passenger flow forecasting project of line 8 confirmed that the passenger flow forecast report of line 8 was not completed until 2005 after continuous revision. However, in 2003 an agreement was signed for line 8 to supply 168 C-class vehicles, i.e., Shentong Group signed an agreement with Shanghai Alstom two years before the release of the forecast report, and decided to use the C-class car. At that time, it was predicted that the forecast passenger flow of line 8 would be about 500,000 passengers per day during the three years from 2007 to 2010. The operator used as initial forecast passenger flow of only 200,000 passengers per day. line 8 was extremely congested upon opening, even leading to physical conflicts between passengers. In 2010, to deal with the overcrowding Shanghai Metro hired passenger pushers to assist commuters boarding line 8 trains. Today, line 8 carries up to over 1 million passengers a day.

The estimated passenger flow of line 6 was more than 105,000. However, the highest passenger flow in the first few days of opening reached 150,000. With a headway of 13.5 minutes at opening and only four carriages, during peak hours people had to wait 45 minutes to get a ride. The relevant departments did not conduct a comprehensive survey of the residents around the proposed line to estimate passenger flow but instead household registration data was used which excludes migrant populations.

===Other controversies===
In June 2012, Shanghai Metro published a post on Weibo asking women to wear more clothing in public. The post argued that it was not surprising for women to be harassed in the subway if they are wearing revealing clothing and called on women to cherish themselves. This post attracted backlash from women&#x27;s rights advocates and feminists who called the post misogynistic.

===Train collisions and incidents===
* March 24, 2004: An evening crash at the turnaround line north of Tonghe Xincun station occurred during testing of the north extension of the line 1 (which opened on December 28, 2004), set 122 had a sideswipe with set 102, resulting in car 92113 damaged beyond repair. In 2007, the damaged car was replaced with a new car. Details of the crash have not been released since ever the accident.
* December 22, 2009, at 5:58 a.m., an electrical fault in the tunnel between South Shaanxi Road station and People&#x27;s Square station caused a few trains to stall. The tripping failure of the power supply catenary was caused by the top of the tunnel falling down and causing a short circuit. The segment between and was suspended. At 6:54 a.m., while the track was under repair, a low-speed collision occurred between two trains on line 1 at . As train set 0150 went to the Shanghai railway station&#x27;s turnaround the signalling system sent a speed code of 65 km/h instead of 20 km/h, resulting in insufficient braking distance as the distance between set 0150 and set 117 was only 118 meters when the signal system sent a code of a speed of 0 km/h. As train set 0150 increased speed from 60.5 km/h to 62 km/h, the train driver commenced emergency braking, preventing a more serious collision. The train collided at a speed of 17 km/h with the side of the rear of set 117 entering the turnaround track from the down platform in the reverse direction. Nobody was injured, but the car 013151 and cars 98033 and 98042 which were badly damaged. There were no passengers aboard set 117. Service resumed at 11:48 a.m. Some passengers on set 0150 were in the train until 11 a.m. The crashes affected millions of morning commuters and occurred during Dongzhi Festival, when people visit cemeteries to pay tribute to their departed ancestors.&lt;br&gt;At 8.40 p.m. another crash occurred and the - section was suspended again. A fire broke out at the substation in , due to a transformer failure caused by fluctuations in the power supply of the external network.
*July 27, 2011, in the evening, after a train of line 10 was sent from station, it was supposed to be sent to station (branch line), but it was sent to by mistake, and then stopped at the station for passengers going to station to disembark. The Shanghai Metro claimed that the incident was caused by &quot;signal debugging failure&quot;.
* September 27, 2011, at 2:51 p.m., two trains on line 10 collided between Yuyuan Garden station and Laoximen station, injuring 284–300 people. Initial investigations found that train operators violated regulations while operating the trains manually after a loss of power on the line caused its signal system to fail. No deaths were reported.
* March 12, 2013, at 16:12, the second car of a line 5 train derailed near station. There were no casualties. This caused the line 5 to run 48 minutes behind schedule. During the delay, the line was cut back to and service to the was served by the Jiangchuan Route 1 shuttle bus. The subway said the accident was caused by &quot;signal equipment failure.&quot;
* 22 December 2024, at 8:00, a Line 11 train (set 1173) traveling at 100km/h between Malu and Wuwei Road collided with a construction crane working on a road connecting the Shanghai-Jiading Expressway and Jiamin Expressway. Most of the glass in the front carriage shattered, and the driver cabin partially collapsed. No people were injured, but the track and train was damaged. The track between Malu and Wuwei Road was closed until 21:30, after all repairs were made. A replacement bus was offered to commuters until then.

===Platform screen door incidents===
* End of July 2006 at the Shanghai Stadium station on line 4 at about 7:50 p.m. a middle-aged woman accidentally caught her foot between the train and the platform as a group of passengers swarmed aboard the train. She pulled out her foot, but her shoe fell under the platform, and she suffered skin trauma.
* July 15, 2007, at 3:34 p.m. 47-year-old Sun Mou entered a southbound line 1 train at Shanghai Indoor Stadium station and got caught between the screen door and the moving train. The train buzzer and screen door lights were activated while the passenger tried to get into the car, but he was unable to squeeze into the compartment due to the crowding. Sun&#x27;s mother sued Shanghai Metro for 1.18 million yuan. The man was found to be carrying 0.29 grams of heroin, and the drug was detected in his blood. As platform screen door had repeatedly caught people, officials said safety switches will be installed on the inside of the screen doors. If someone touches the safety switch, the train will be suspended. A laser detection device was under development to reduce the chance of similar incidents.
* July 24, 2007, at 2:41 p.m. A passenger entered a northbound line 1 train at Xujiahui station when the buzzer sounded. His laptop bag was caught between the train door and the screen door and hit the tunnel wall, falling to the roadbed as the train began to move. The laptop was valued at 11,350 yuan and Shanghai Metro was only willing to compensate 2,500 yuan. The passenger took the matter to court, and both parties were ultimately found at fault.
* On July 5, 2010, at the Zhongshan Park station a woman died after she was dragged between the train and the platform screen doors when the train started moving, causing her body to collide with a safety barrier.
* On June 6, 2018, at People&#x27;s Square station on line 8 at about 4 p.m. a woman suffered a head injury after she became stuck between the platform screen doors. She later unsuccessfully sued the metro operator for hospital expenses, and claimed she did not hear the door closing chime.
* On January 22, 2022, at 16:30 on line 15 Qi&#x27;an Road station an elderly woman was injured and later died after becoming trapped between the platform screen door and train.

<doc id="734853" wikidata="Q3661754" url="?curid=734853" title="Cashflow matching">
<text>Cash flow matching is a process of hedging in which a company or other entity matches its cash outflows (i.e., financial obligations) with its cash inflows over a given time horizon. It is a subset of immunization strategies in finance. Cash flow matching is of particular importance to defined benefit pension plans.

==Solution with linear programming==
It is possible to solve the simple cash flow matching problem using linear programming. Suppose that we have a choice of formula_1 bonds with which to receive cash flows over formula_2 time periods in order to cover liabilities formula_3 for each time period. The formula_4th bond in time period formula_5 is assumed to have known cash flows formula_6 and initial price formula_7. It possible to buy formula_8 bonds and to run a surplus formula_9 in a given time period, both of which must be non-negative, and leads to the set of constraints:formula_10Our goal is to minimize the initial cost of purchasing bonds to meet the liabilities in each time period, given by formula_11. Together, these requirements give rise to the associated linear programming problem:formula_12where formula_13 and formula_14, with entries:formula_15In the instance when fixed income instruments (not necessarily bonds) are used to provide the dedicated cash flows, it is unlikely to be the case that fractional components are available for purchase. Therefore, a more realistic approach to cash flow matching is to employ mixed-integer linear programming to select a discrete number of instruments with which to match liabilities.

<doc id="734854" wikidata="Q487375" url="?curid=734854" title="Subitizing">
<text>Subitizing is the rapid, accurate, and effortless ability to perceive small quantities of items in a set, typically when there are four or fewer items, without relying on linguistic or arithmetic processes. The term refers to the sensation of instantly knowing how many objects are in the visual scene when their number falls within the subitizing range.

Sets larger than about four to five items cannot be subitized unless the items appear in a pattern with which the person is familiar (such as the six dots on one face of a die). Large, familiar sets might be counted one-by-one (or the person might calculate the number through a rapid calculation if they can mentally group the elements into a few small sets). A person could also estimate the number of a large set—a skill similar to, but different from, subitizing. The term subitizing was coined in 1949 by E. L. Kaufman et al., and is derived from the Latin adjective &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;sudden&quot;).

The accuracy, speed, and confidence with which observers make judgments of the number of items are critically dependent on the number of elements to be enumerated. Judgments made for displays composed of around one to four items are rapid, accurate, and confident. However, once there are more than four items to count, judgments are made with decreasing accuracy and confidence. In addition, response times rise in a dramatic fashion, with an extra 250–350ms added for each additional item within the display beyond about four.

While the increase in response time for each additional element within a display is 250–350ms per item outside the subitizing range, there is still a significant, albeit smaller, increase of 40–100ms per item within the subitizing range. A similar pattern of reaction times is found in young children, although with steeper slopes for both the subitizing range and the enumeration range. This suggests there is no span of apprehension as such, if this is defined as the number of items which can be immediately apprehended by cognitive processes, since there is an extra cost associated with each additional item enumerated. However, the relative differences in costs associated with enumerating items within the subitizing range are small, whether measured in terms of accuracy, confidence, or speed of response. Furthermore, the values of all measures appear to differ markedly inside and outside the subitizing range. So, while there may be no span of apprehension, there appear to be real differences in the ways in which a small number of elements is processed by the visual system (i.e. approximately four or fewer items), compared with larger numbers of elements (i.e. approximately more than four items).

A 2006 study demonstrated that subitizing and counting are not restricted to visual perception, but also extend to tactile perception, when observers had to name the number of stimulated fingertips. A 2008 study also demonstrated subitizing and counting in auditory perception. Even though the existence of subitizing in tactile perception has been questioned, this effect has been replicated many times and can be therefore considered as robust. The subitizing effect has also been obtained in tactile perception with congenitally blind adults. Together, these findings support the idea that subitizing is a general perceptual mechanism extending to auditory and tactile processing.

==Enumerating afterimages==
As the derivation of the term &quot;subitizing&quot; suggests, the feeling associated with making a number judgment within the subitizing range is one of immediately being aware of the displayed elements. When the number of objects presented exceeds the subitizing range, this feeling is lost, and observers commonly report an impression of shifting their viewpoint around the display, until all the elements presented have been counted. The ability of observers to count the number of items within a display can be limited, either by the rapid presentation and subsequent masking of items, or by requiring observers to respond quickly. Both procedures have little, if any, effect on enumeration within the subitizing range. These techniques may restrict the ability of observers to count items by limiting the degree to which observers can shift their &quot;zone of attention&quot; successively to different elements within the display.

Atkinson, Campbell, and Francis demonstrated that visual afterimages could be employed in order to achieve similar results. Using a flashgun to illuminate a line of white disks, they were able to generate intense afterimages in dark-adapted observers. Observers were required to verbally report how many disks had been presented, both at 10s and at 60s after the flashgun exposure. Observers reported being able to see all the disks presented for at least 10s, and being able to perceive at least some of the disks after 60s. Unlike simply displaying the images for 10 and 60 second intervals, when presented in the form of afterimages, eye movement cannot be employed for the purpose of counting: when the subjects move their eyes, the images also move. Despite a long period of time to enumerate the number of disks presented when the number of disks presented fell outside the subitizing range (i.e., 5–12 disks), observers made consistent enumeration errors in both the 10s and 60s conditions. In contrast, no errors occurred within the subitizing range (i.e., 1–4 disks), in either the 10s or 60s conditions.

==Brain structures involved in subitizing and counting==
The work on the enumeration of afterimages supports the view that different cognitive processes operate for the enumeration of elements inside and outside the subitizing range, and as such raises the possibility that subitizing and counting involve different brain circuits. However, functional imaging research has been interpreted both to support different and shared processes.

===Bálint&#x27;s syndrome===
Social theory supporting the view that subitizing and counting may involve functionally and anatomically distinct brain areas comes from patients with simultanagnosia, one of the key components of Bálint&#x27;s syndrome. Patients with this disorder suffer from an inability to perceive visual scenes properly, being unable to localize objects in space, either by looking at the objects, pointing to them, or by verbally reporting their position. Despite these dramatic symptoms, such patients are able to correctly recognize individual objects. Crucially, people with simultanagnosia are unable to enumerate objects outside the subitizing range, either failing to count certain objects, or alternatively counting the same object several times.

However, people with simultanagnosia have no difficulty enumerating objects within the subitizing range. The disorder is associated with bilateral damage to the parietal lobe, an area of the brain linked with spatial shifts of attention. These neuropsychological results are consistent with the view that the process of counting, but not that of subitizing, requires active shifts of attention. However, recent research has questioned this conclusion by finding that attention also affects subitizing.

===Imaging enumeration===
A further source of research upon the neural processes of subitizing compared to counting comes from positron emission tomography (PET) research upon normal observers. Such research compares the brain activity associated with enumeration processes inside (i.e., 1–4 items) for subitizing, and outside (i.e., 5–8 items) for counting.

Such research finds that within the subitizing and counting range activation occurs bilaterally in the occipital extrastriate cortex and superior parietal lobe/intraparietal sulcus. This has been interpreted as evidence that shared processes are involved. However, the existence of further activations during counting in the right inferior frontal regions, and the anterior cingulate have been interpreted as suggesting the existence of distinct processes during counting related to the activation of regions involved in the shifting of attention.

==Educational applications==
Historically, many systems have attempted to use subitizing to identify full or partial quantities. In the twentieth century, mathematics educators started to adopt some of these systems, as reviewed in examples below, but often switched to more abstract color-coding to represent quantities up to ten.

In the 1990s, babies three weeks old were shown to differentiate between 1–3 objects, that is, to subitize. A more recent meta-study summarizing five different studies concluded that infants are born with an innate ability to differentiate quantities within a small range, which increases over time. By the age of seven that ability increases to 4–7 objects. Some practitioners claim that with training, children are capable of subitizing 15+ objects correctly.

===Abacus===

The hypothesized use of yupana, an Inca counting system, placed up to five counters in connected trays for calculations.

In each place value, the Chinese abacus uses four or five beads to represent units, which are subitized, and one or two separate beads, which symbolize fives. This allows multi-digit operations such as carrying and borrowing to occur without subitizing beyond five.

European abacuses use ten beads in each register, but usually separate them into fives by color.

===Twentieth century teaching tools===

The idea of instant recognition of quantities has been adopted by several pedagogical systems, such as Montessori, Cuisenaire and Dienes. However, these systems only partially use subitizing, attempting to make all quantities from 1 to 10 instantly recognizable. To achieve it, they code quantities by color and length of rods or bead strings representing them. Recognizing such visual or tactile representations and associating quantities with them involves different mental operations from subitizing.

==Other applications==

One of the most basic applications is in digit grouping in large numbers, which allow one to tell the size at a glance, rather than having to count. For example, writing one million (1000000) as 1,000,000 (or 1.000.000 or ) or one (short) billion (1000000000) as 1,000,000,000 (or other forms, such as 1,00,00,00,000 in the Indian numbering system) makes it much easier to read. This is particularly important in accounting and finance, as an error of a single decimal digit changes the amount by a factor of ten. This is also found in computer programming languages for literal values, some of which use digit separators.

Dice, playing cards and other gaming devices traditionally split quantities into subitizable groups with recognizable patterns. The behavioural advantage of this grouping method has been scientifically investigated by Ciccione and Dehaene, who showed that counting performances are improved if the groups share the same amount of items and the same repeated pattern.

A comparable application is to split up binary and hexadecimal number representations, telephone numbers, bank account numbers (e.g., IBAN, social security numbers, number plates, etc.) into groups ranging from 2 to 5 digits separated by spaces, dots, dashes, or other separators. This is done to support overseeing completeness of a number when comparing or retyping. This practice of grouping characters also supports easier memorization of large numbers and character structures.

==Self assessment==
There is at least one game that can be played online to self assess one&#x27;s ability to subitize.

<text>Dougherty is the name of a phantom island that was believed to be located in the extreme south of the Pacific Ocean, roughly halfway between Cape Horn and New Zealand. It is named for Captain Dougherty of the &quot;James Stewart&quot;, an English whaler, who in 1841 reported discovering it at . He described it as 5–6 miles long with a high bluff to the northeast and covered in snow. Dougherty&#x27;s discovery was confirmed by Captain Keates of the &quot;Louise&quot; in 1860, giving its coordinates as , and by Captain Stannard of the &quot;Cingalese&quot; in 1886, giving the location as .

However, thorough exploration of the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries established that the island does not exist. Captain Davis of the &quot;Nimrod&quot; suggested that the most likely explanation was that Dougherty, Keates, and Stannard had all been deceived by fog banks or icebergs (none, after all, claimed to have actually landed on the island): &quot;I am inclined to think Dougherty Island has melted.&quot;

The island continued to appear on maps as late as 1934.

<text>Podesta is a phantom island reported at by the Italian Captain Pinocchio of the vessel &quot;Barone Podestà&quot; (Hereward Carrington, &quot;Carrington Collection&quot;, page 21) in 1879 claiming it to be just over a kilometre (1000 yards) in circumference located 1390 km (750 n. mi.) due west of El Quisco, Chile. It was originally located 900 miles west of Chile&#x27;s coast. The island was charted until 1935, when it was removed from charts (marked &quot;Existence Doubtful&quot; by Defense Mapping Agency&#x27;s 1975 Operation Navigational Chart R-22). The island has not been found since.

An island near Easter Island was sighted in 1912 but was likewise never seen again. Sarah Ann Island northwest of Easter Island was another island also removed from naval charts when a search in 1932 failed to find it.

Currently the micronation of the Republic of Rino Island claims &quot;sovereignty&quot; over the Podestá Island.

<doc id="734861" wikidata="Q662171" url="?curid=734861" title="California State Route 13">
<text>State Route 13 (SR 13) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California. It runs entirely in Alameda County, connecting Interstate 580 in Oakland to Interstate 80/Interstate 580 in Berkeley.

It consists of three contiguous segments: the Warren Freeway from I-580 to State Route 24 in Oakland; Tunnel Road, a narrow two-lane road to Claremont Avenue in Berkeley; and Ashby Avenue, a main east–west street through south Berkeley to I-80/I-580.

==Route description==
The route currently begins at Interstate 580 near Mills College in East Oakland and continues north as the Warren Freeway, named after former Alameda County District Attorney, California Governor and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren. The four-lane freeway takes a largely straight path as it runs through a scenic valley. This valley is enclosed by the far eastern hills of Oakland and a shutter ridge that has been driven northwestward along the Hayward Fault, and the entire freeway lies within the earthquake fault zone of the Hayward Fault. In the event of a major earthquake on the fault, this section of SR 13 may sustain heavy damage. Numerous overpasses have recently undergone extensive seismic retrofitting.

The tall trees on the highway&#x27;s side make the highway appear narrower, and until late 2004, a dense group of trees also lined most of the highway&#x27;s median. For most of the day, the freeway experiences only modest traffic, which makes it a speedy bypass around downtown Oakland. Much of the traffic on this highway comes from SR 24&#x27;s commute hour congestion backing up onto SR 13 northbound via the exchange between the highways.
After going through an interchange with State Route 24 (upgraded August 1999) near the entrance to the Caldecott Tunnel, however, SR 13 takes drastic changes in its quality and capacity. The freeway ends at an uphill junction and the route is defaulted onto Tunnel Road, a much more narrow two-lane road that bends to the west and winds downhill. Upon reaching the foot of the hill, Tunnel Road becomes Ashby Avenue, a markedly urban (and very busy) two-lane street with an east–west routing. Entering Berkeley, UC Berkeley is north on Telegraph Avenue, while Ashby BART station is located at Adeline Street. Past San Pablo Avenue (SR 123), Route 13 (as Ashby Avenue) runs through a more modest neighborhood before reaching its current end at Interstate 80/Interstate 580.

SR 13 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 13 is known as the Warren Freeway from Route 24 to Route 580, as named by Assembly Concurrent Resolution 96, Chapter 166 in 1957.

==History==
SR 13 was created to accommodate the construction of the Grove-Shafter Freeway, now designated State Route 24. Before the construction of the Grove-Shafter, Ashby Avenue was State Route 24, while the balance of the route of today&#x27;s Warren Freeway was not a designated state highway. The main thoroughfare through the Montclair District in those days was Mountain Boulevard.

State Route 13 was formed in 1947, from SR 24 to then-US 50 via Warren Boulevard. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, it extended north to I-80 over part of SR 24, and was rerouted on its current routing. Before its designation, it was known as several different legislative route numbers, including 258 from Interstate 580 to present-day SR 61, and 227 from Warren Boulevard to U.S. Route 50. This latter segment was not finished in 1963 and only existed from SR 24 to Joaquin Miller Road. However, the finished portion along Warren Boulevard was commissioned as part of the state highway system in 1947.

The portion of SR 13 between SR 24 and I-80 was known as Sign Route 24; however, it was legislatively designated as Route 206 since 1935. The portion between I-80 and SR 61 was also part of Legislative Route 206 and was commissioned into the state highway system in 1959.

Route 13 was to have been a freeway bypass of Oakland and Berkeley and would have extended south from its present end to the Nimitz Freeway (Route 880). State law describes an even longer Route 13, which would start further south at Route 61 and end at an unconstructed part of Route 61 west of Emeryville. The latter end would require an interchange over water. However, local resistance to further freeway construction in Oakland prevented the extension. Similar resistance in Berkeley has kept Route 13 from being built as a freeway north of Route 24, hence its role as a surface street.

In August 2004, Caltrans began replacing the median&#x27;s original metal guardrails with a new wall along the stretch of SR 
13 between SR 24 and I-580. This allowed road crews to drive street-sweeping vehicles along the shoulders throughout the week, rather than sending people to pick up trash by hand. However, residents frequenting SR 13 have said that the median appears to be filled with fewer trees and bushes than prior to Caltrans construction. These trees once densely lining the median have long supplemented the lush vegetation on both sides of the highway to beautify this scenic route.

<text>Philips van der Aa (died after 1586) was a politician in the Seventeen Provinces and a statesman of the Dutch Republic during its struggle for independence, the Eighty Years&#x27; War.

He was born in Mechelen, and was mayor of the city in 1564, but was banished by the Duke of Alva. He returned on the side of William I, Prince of Orange (William the Silent). In 1572, he came back to power in Mechelen by cunning. In 1573 he was assigned as councillor at the court of Diederik Sonoy, and in 1574 he became commander in Gorkum.

<text>Zills or zils (from Turkish &#x27;cymbals&#x27;), also called finger cymbals, are small metallic cymbals used in belly dancing and similar performances. They are called &#x27; (&#x27;) in Egypt. They are similar to Tibetan tingsha bells. In Western music, several pairs can be set in a frame to make a tambourine.

Names in other languages include &quot;nuqaisāt&quot; (after the &quot;naqus&quot;) in Arabic and used among Berbers, &quot;ṣunnūj ṣaghīra&quot; in Arabic, &quot;Zang-e sarangoshti&quot; (Persian, possibly related to the &quot;zang&quot;), sanj angshati (سنج انگشتی) (Persian, related to Sanj), &quot;çeng&quot; in Turkish, &quot;p&#x27;eng chung&quot; in Chinese.

== History ==

Zills, or finger cymbals, are part of a family of musical instruments known as &quot;clappers&quot;. Clappers are musical instruments made of wood, bone, metal, and other substances that are played by being struck against each other. Clappers come in pairs and are often held in the hands, fastened together, or strapped to the performer&#x27;s fingers. The clapper family also includes spoons, bones and castanets.
One of the earliest forms of clappers are wooden &quot;krotala&quot; already present in Greece around 500 BC. Ancient Greek potteries depict men and women celebrating at Dionysian festivals, some of them playing krotala. From known representations, ancient Greeks used metallic cymbals, but they held only one cymbal in each hand and clapped them together to strike them. The finger cymbal practice appears in representations from the Roman Empire period. Examples of mosaics and stone reliefs showing Roman finger cymbal players come from Bulgaria, Italy and Belgium, and are dated between the second and fourth century CE. It is not known whether the finger cymbal practice was continuous or was forgotten and then reinvented much later in the Middle East. At least, it is clear that the tradition of dancers with different types of clappers continued through the Middle Ages. First representations of &quot;modern&quot; finger cymbal players in Egypt and Turkey date from the 18th century at the latest.

Zills are one of the main percussive elements of Middle Eastern belly dancing. The use of zill in belly dancing is particularly present in the Ghawazi, a line of hereditary dancers. Zills are also important in some rituals of Egyptian culture. 
Finger cymbals are used in the Sufi religious music. They are also used in the &quot;zaar&quot;, a healing ritual utilizing rhythmic songs and dances meant to soothe Jinn, a form of magically empowered spirit beings. Dancers use the zill to find a rhythm that soothes the spirits, which then becomes the rhythm performed by the ensemble.

== Features ==
A set of zills consists of four cymbals, two for each hand. Zills come in a range of sizes, the most common having a diameter of about . Different sizes and shapes of zills will produce sounds that differ in volume, tone and resonance. For instance, a dancer performing with an orchestra will use a larger zill with more volume, whereas many belly dancers may use a zill with a more delicate sound, depending on the venue and whether their music is live or recorded, amplified or acoustic. American Tribal dancers typically use a much larger zill with a more mellow tone.

Zill manufacturers commonly use brass rather than the bronze used for larger cymbals, and may design their own brass alloys specifically to achieve particular sound qualities. They may plate some zills in order to give a specific color to them. Zills vary in appearance and may be shiny, dull, plain or engraved.

Before the invention of elastic, zills were tied onto the fingers with leather strips. Modern cymbalists use elastic to secure the zills, one to the thumb and one to the middle finger of each hand. Many zills have two slots to allow the threading of the elastic through the zill, allowing greater control of the instrument. Others have a single hole, allowing greater wobble and creative use with speed.

Zills played as idiophones (two on each hand) can be played in many ways to produce a wide and subtle range of sound, from quiet clicking, bell-like ringing, muted cupped sounds, loud clacks, and even a small range of pitch change. Zills belong to the family of instruments used in Ottoman military bands, and also occasionally appear as part of Western orchestral or other musical performances. In these cases, musicians usually just call them &quot;finger cymbals&quot; and use them to obtain a ringing sound with &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; associations. Percussionists who are not exclusively cymbalists sometimes play finger cymbals by striking one cymbal with a drumstick, or by holding one cymbal in each hand by gripping the strap between the thumb and the index finger, and striking the rims together. They tend to use zills for occasional flourishes in the music rather than for complex rhythms and sounds. For more intricate rhythms, an orchestral player might attach a cymbal to both his thumb and first finger. Then, placing that hand between his other hand and knee, the player will alternate between striking the knee and the opposite hand. Each of the motions produce one articulation of the cymbals.

There are many rhythms in belly dancing music that can be spelled out in finger cymbal playing. The style of playing varies from one style and era of dance to the next.
* Triples, not to be confused with triplets: &quot;left/right/left/pause&quot; – “giddyup, giddyup, giddyup”)
* Quads: &quot;L/R/L/R&quot; (no pause)
* Beledi: &quot;dum/dum/tek-a-tek/dum-tek-a-tek&quot;
* Chiftatelli: &quot;dum/dum/tek-a-tek/dum/dum/dum&quot; – “John went to the sea; caught. three. fish.”
* Ayoub: &quot;dum/a-tek-tek&quot; – “buy more shoes, and…buy more shoes, and . . .”
* Bolero: &quot;dum/tek-a-tek-tek/dum/dum/dum/dum&quot; – “I want to be a belly dancer”
* In the count of the beat, the gallop is played as &quot;and a ONE, and a TWO...&quot; It can also be played as &quot;right/left/right/rest&quot;. Many teachers recommend thinking of it as &quot;dominant hand / non-dominant hand / dominant hand / rest&quot;.
Zills are also used in Sufi music, and may be played arrhythmically in a lyrical flow of sound for meditations and sound healing.

<doc id="734884" wikidata="Q744996" url="?curid=734884" title="ZAZ Zaporozhets">
<text>ZAZ Zaporozhets ( ) was a series of rear-wheel-drive superminis (city cars in their first generation) designed and built from 1958 at the ZAZ factory in Soviet Ukraine. Different models of the Zaporozhets, all of which had an air-cooled engine in the rear, were produced until 1994. Since the late 1980s, the final series, ZAZ-968M, was replaced by the cardinally different ZAZ-1102 Tavria hatchback, which featured a front-wheel drive and a more powerful water-cooled engine.

The name &quot;Zaporozhets&quot; translates into a Cossack of the Zaporizhian Sich or а man from Zaporozhye (now Zaporizhzhia) or the Zaporozhye Oblast (now Zaporizhzhia Oblast).

Zaporozhets is still well known in many former Soviet states. Like the Volkswagen Beetle or East Germany&#x27;s Trabant, the Zaporozhets was destined to become a &quot;people&#x27;s car&quot; of the Soviet Union, and as such it was the most affordable vehicle of its era. At the same time, it was rather sturdy and known for its excellent performance on poor roads. Another important advantage of the Zaporozhets was its ease of repair. The car&#x27;s appearance gave birth to several nicknames that became well known across the Soviet Union: &quot;horbatyi&quot; (&quot;hunchback&quot;, owing to ZAZ-965&#x27;s insect-like form; although ZAZ factory workers never used this nickname), &quot;malysh&quot; (), &quot;ushastyi&quot; (&quot;big-eared&quot;, due to ZAZ-966 and ZAZ-968&#x27;s round air intakes on each side of the car to cool the rear-mounted engine), &quot;zapor&quot; (&quot;constipation&quot;), &quot;mylnitsa&quot; (&quot;soap-box&quot;, for ZAZ-968M, lacking &quot;ears&quot; and producing a more box-like appearance).

Numerous special versions of the Zaporozhets were produced, equipped with additional sets of controls that allowed operating the car with a limited set of limbs, and were given for free or with considerable discounts to disabled people, especially war veterans - similar to SMZ-series microcars. These mobility cars would at times take up to 25% of ZAZ factory output.

== First generation (1960–1969) ==
===ZAZ-965===
The ZAZ-965 was a city car produced from 1960 to 1963. The design of a simple economy city car, and one in part taking the place of the soon to be discontinued Moskvitch 401, began in 1956. Following the growing trend of city cars (then accounting for between 25% and 40% of all European car sales), the minister in charge of &quot;Minavtroprom&quot; (the Soviet automotive ministry) Nikolay Strokin selected the new Fiat 600 as the model to follow. However, despite being visually similar to the Fiat, the ZAZ was in fact a completely different car.


The first prototype, the Moskvitch-444, was designed by MZMA in October 1957; it used the same glass for front and rear windows. Its ground clearance, on wheels, was . The prototype was first powered by a flat twin-cylinder MD-65 engine provided by the Irbitskiy Motorcycle Plant, which was &quot;totally unsuited&quot;: it produced only and lasted only between major overhauls. As a result, a search for another engine was begun, and the success of the VW Type 1&#x27;s boxer led to a preference for an air-cooled engine, which NAMI (the National Automobile Institute) had on the drawing board. &quot;Minavtroprom&quot;, however, preferred a rear-mounted V4, the NAMI-G, which had the additional advantage of being developed for the LuAZ-967. As a result, it had characteristics not common for automobile engines, including a magnesium alloy engine block. (This engine, the MeMZ-965, would be built by the Melitopolski Motor Plant, MeMZ.) The V4 was a rather unusual engine configuration for an automobile, with its only other notable use in a similar era being in Ford vehicles like the Taunus and Transit van. It had the drawback of needing to have the rear of the car redesigned to fit, as well as needing a new rear suspension. The influence of the LuAZ designers led to the introduction of independent suspension on all four wheels. Its front doors open in a manner like suicide doors, partly to make it more accessible to the disabled.

One of the primary differences was that the engine, which featured a V4 layout in place of the Fiat&#x27;s inline-four, was air-cooled, like the flat-4 engine used by Volkswagen in vehicles like the Beetle and Type 2 microbus. The Zaporozhets also featured bigger wheels and front suspension on torsion bars. In 1958, the government ordered production of the car in the reformed ZAZ factory, under its final designation ZAZ-965. All further production of the car was carried out there.

The new car was approved for production at the MeMZ factory on the 28th of November, 1958, changing the name to ZAZ (Zaporizhzhia Automobile Building Plant) to reflect the new profile. The Zaporizhzhia factory was supplemented with the Mikoyan Diesel-Building Factory in Melitopol, which was part of the &quot;Soyuzdiesel&quot; combinat.

The first car, dubbed the ZAZ-965 Zaporozhets, was delivered 12 June 1959, was approved 25 July 1960, and entered production 25 October. The Zaporozhets was priced at 1,800 redenominated roubles.

There was also a car-derived van model for the Soviet post office, the ZAZ-965S, with right-hand drive and blanked-off windows.

===ZAZ-965A===
The ZAZ-965A was an improvement on the ZAZ-965 and was produced from November 1962 to May 1969. In total, 322,106 units of the ZAZ-965 were produced.
It was powered by a MeMZ-965 rear-mounted, air-cooled OHV V4 engine, partially of aluminium design, producing . From November 1966 some cars were fitted with the slightly more powerful MeMZ-965A engine. The ZAZ-965&#x27;s modest engine output has given ground to an urban joke that it was used as a starter motor in Soviet tanks.

As Soviet drivers were expected to do much of the servicing themselves, and mechanics trained in the servicing of consumer automobiles were in short supply, the engine&#x27;s 90° V4 layout proved more practical, especially in harsh winter conditions. The higher centre of gravity of the engine also provided superior traction on steep slopes, though this advantage, which was also continued in later models, came at the expense of the car&#x27;s infamous lack of cornering stability.

The ZAZ-965A also had its versions for the disabled (ZAZ-965B, AB, AR), as well as a more luxurious export variant, the ZAZ-965AE Yalta.

Despite the low prestige of those cars, they have shown an unbeaten accessibility and popularity among the people of the Soviet Union, becoming the &quot;car for pensioners and intellectuals&quot;. They were the cheapest Soviet-made cars. Quite a large number of them were produced in variants for disabled people, with modified steering.

Between November 1966 and May 1969 the ZAZ-965A and its successor, the ZAZ966, were produced concurrently.

When production of the ZAZ-965 ended, 322,116 had been built.

The ZAZ-965 also inspired the 1962 prototype NAMI 086, named &quot;Sputnik&quot; (Fellow Traveller), with a vee-twin (half an MeMZ-965), electromagnetic clutch and four-speed transmission. Fitted with a four-wheel independent suspension and weighing just , and intended for use by the disabled, it was never built.

The ZAZ KD of 1969 was also based on the ZAZ-965, fitted with a glassfibre body, giving it a weight of only 500 kg and a top speed of using just . It was never produced in quantity, either.

== Second generation (1966–1994) ==
===ZAZ-966===

The second generation of the Zaporozhets was a series of subcompact cars, starting with the ZAZ-966, which entered production in November 1966, although the prototype was first demonstrated in 1961. It had a completely restyled bodywork (done entirely by ZAZ), no longer resembling the Fiat 600 and arguably similar to the Chevrolet Corvair, Hillman Imp or the NSU Prinz. This was an effort to cure some of the ZAZ-965&#x27;s issues, such as torsion bars that lost tension, suicide doors, and engines that overheated and made the cabin uncomfortably loud. The engine was the MeMZ-966A. A radio was standard equipment. The price had inched up, too, from 1,800 roubles at the ZAZ-965&#x27;s debut to 2,200 by 1969.

While featuring a larger two-door notchback saloon body, it still featured an air-cooled V4 engine and featured more prominent air intakes – the so-called &quot;ears&quot;, although a decorative chrome grille was also present. The car&#x27;s rear suspension was also replaced. The ZAZ-966 started out as the simpler ZAZ-966V (ЗАЗ-966В in Cyrillic) with the 30 PS engine from the ZAZ-965A, which was also featured on all later models. Much like the ZAZ-965A, the ZAZ-966V was also produced in several special variants for the disabled (VR, VB, VB2 - until January 1973). It was produced in tandem with the ZAZ-965 from November 1966 to May 1969.

ZAZ launched an upgraded ZAZ-966B in 1968, powered by a new MeMZ-968 V4, while the 30 PS ZAZ-966A-powered model became the ZAZ-966-1 which was only ever produced in small numbers. The ZAZ-966B, weighing in at , was heavier than the earlier model, but faster, reaching .

The ZAZ-966 was discontinued in 1972, with the introduction of the ZAZ-968.

Nicknamed &quot;Zapo&quot; in the Eastern Bloc, the ZAZ-966 also found some buyers in Western Europe, including Finland and France. Some markets swapped the original engine for a Renault unit.

===ZAZ-968===

The ZAZ-968 and its variants were produced from 1971 to 1980. It featured the same MeMZ-968 V4 as the ZAZ-966, but the exterior design was slightly modernized. The most obvious alteration was replacing the fake chrome grille in the car&#x27;s front with a horizontal chrome decoration. Among other changes was a less austere dashboard and better front brakes. The ZAZ-968 was discontinued in 1978, having been produced simultaneously with the newer 968A since 1973, which was produced until 1980. It introduced new safety measures, including a new steering wheel and a plastic dashboard instead of the earlier metal one. The ZAZ-968A also had its variants for the disabled (the ZAZ-968R, B, B2, AB, and AB2) with the engine.

Toward the end of 1974, the up-market ZAZ-968A debuted, continuing in production until 1979. Among its improvements was a padded dash, energy-absorbing (collapsing) steering column, and seats from the VAZ-2101. The export ZAZ-968E (destined mostly for the Eastern Bloc) had headlights modified to meet international standards, a safety glass windscreen, and an anti-theft steering lock.

===ZAZ-968M===
In 1979, the ZAZ-968 series was replaced by the modernized ZAZ-968M. Prototyped in 1977, it had the &quot;ears&quot; removed and replaced much of the chrome exterior with black plastic. Its interior design was also upgraded, featuring an enclosed glove box and a slightly more modern dashboard. It was offered with either the MeMZ-968E (, carbureted, low-compression for 76-octane fuel); ZAZ-968GE (, dual carburettor); or the MeMZ-968BE (, 8.4:1 compression, for 93-octane) engine. Instead of the side-mounted &quot;ears&quot;, the hood lid and rear quarter panels were louvered.

The ZAZ-968M was the last Zaporozhets model and also spent the most time in production, with cars being made from 1979 to 1 June 1994. By that time, the Soviet Union had collapsed, Ukraine had become independent, and modern, front wheel drive economy cars from the West like the Volkswagen Polo and Ford Fiesta had become available in quantity, vehicles which the 1950s and 60s designed Zaporozhets had no hope of competing with. Some of its special variants include the ZAZ-968MB2, for drivers who had only one foot, and the ZAZ-968MB for drivers who had no feet.

Planned ZAZ-968s with or engines would never enter production, likely a side effect of the stagnation of Russia in the 1970s and 80s and the subsequent reign of Gorbachev, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the breakup of the Soviet Union occupying more attention than a little Ukrainian-built economy car whose mechanicals dated back to 1959.

Among the export variants produced by ZAZ were ZAZ-965E, ZAZ-965AE, ZAZ-966E, ZAZ-968E, and ZAZ-968AE, which had improved features compared to vehicles made for the home market. Depending on target markets, the model names &quot;Jalta&quot; or &quot;Eliette&quot; were used for these cars.

In total, 3,422,444 Zaporozhets vehicles were manufactured in the Melitopol factory from 1960 to 1994, with all of them using the same family of air cooled V-4 engines mounted in the back.

==In popular culture==
In the 1963 Soviet romantic comedy &quot;Three Plus Two&quot;, a ZAZ-965 with license plate number 18-15-лдг is featured in numerous scenes throughout the movie, and is even referred to directly in the script as &quot;a tin can of the Zaporozhets system.&quot;

In the 1995 James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye,&quot; Bond&#x27;s CIA contact Jack Wade drove a 1963 ZAZ-965A.

In the 2011 animated feature film &quot;Cars 2&quot;, the Trunkovs (Vladimir, Petrov, Lubewig, and Tolga) are based on the ZAZ-968 Zaporozhets.

In the video game &quot;MudRunner&quot;, a car based on the ZAZ-968 is found in several maps named A-968M. 

In &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; the car is shown in dilapidated condition as a prop that clutters some roads.

It also appears as a prop in the &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; games.

<text>The English language name Bruce arrived in Scotland with the Normans, from the place name Brix, Manche in Normandy, France, meaning &quot;the willowlands&quot;. Initially promulgated via the descendants of king Robert the Bruce (1274−1329), it has been a Scottish surname since medieval times; it is now a common male given name.

The variant &quot;Lebrix&quot; and &quot;Le Brix&quot; are French variations of the surname.

<text>In mathematics, the canonical bundle of a non-singular algebraic variety formula_1 of dimension formula_2 over a field is the line bundle formula_3, which is the formula_2th exterior power of the cotangent bundle formula_5 on formula_1.

Over the complex numbers, it is the determinant bundle of the holomorphic cotangent bundle formula_7. Equivalently, it is the line bundle of holomorphic formula_2-forms on formula_1.
This is the dualising object for Serre duality on formula_1. It may equally well be considered as an invertible sheaf.

The canonical class is the divisor class of a Cartier divisor formula_11 on formula_1 giving rise to the canonical bundle — it is an equivalence class for linear equivalence on formula_1, and any divisor in it may be called a canonical divisor. An anticanonical divisor is any divisor −formula_11 with formula_11 canonical.

The anticanonical bundle is the corresponding inverse bundle formula_16. When the anticanonical bundle of formula_1 is ample, formula_1 is called a Fano variety.

==The adjunction formula==

Suppose that formula_19 is a smooth variety and that formula_20 is a smooth divisor on formula_19. The adjunction formula relates the canonical bundles of formula_19 and formula_20. It is a natural isomorphism
:formula_24
In terms of canonical classes, it is
:formula_25
This formula is one of the most powerful formulas in algebraic geometry. An important tool of modern birational geometry is inversion of adjunction, which allows one to deduce results about the singularities of formula_19 from the singularities of formula_20.

==The canonical bundle formula==
Let formula_19 be a normal surface. A genus formula_29 fibration formula_30 of formula_19 is a proper flat morphism formula_32 to a smooth curve such that formula_33 and all fibers of formula_32 have arithmetic genus formula_29. If formula_19 is a smooth projective surface and the fibers of formula_32 do not contain rational curves of self-intersection formula_38, then the fibration is called minimal. For example, if formula_19 admits a (minimal) genus 0 fibration, then is formula_19 is birationally ruled, that is, birational to formula_41.

For a minimal genus 1 fibration (also called elliptic fibrations) formula_30 all but finitely many fibers of formula_32 are geometrically integral and all fibers are geometrically connected (by Zariski&#x27;s connectedness theorem). In particular, for a fiber formula_44 of formula_32, we have that formula_46 where formula_47 is a canonical divisor of formula_19; so for formula_49, if formula_50 is geometrically integral if formula_51 and formula_52 otherwise.

Consider a minimal genus 1 fibration formula_30. Let formula_54 be the finitely many fibers that are not geometrically integral and write formula_55 where formula_56 is greatest common divisor of coefficients of the expansion of formula_57 into integral components; these are called multiple fibers. By cohomology and base change one has that formula_58 where formula_59 is an invertible sheaf and formula_60 is a torsion sheaf (formula_60 is supported on formula_62 such that formula_63). Then, one has that 
:formula_64
where formula_65 for each formula_66 and formula_67.
One notes that 
:formula_68.

For example, for the minimal genus 1 fibration of a (quasi)-bielliptic surface induced by the Albanese morphism, the canonical bundle formula gives that this fibration has no multiple fibers. A similar deduction can be made for any minimal genus 1 fibration of a K3 surface. On the other hand, a minimal genus one fibration of an Enriques surface will always admit multiple fibers and so, such a surface will not admit a section.

==Singular case==
On a singular variety formula_19, there are several ways to define the canonical divisor. If the variety is normal, it is smooth in codimension one. In particular, we can define canonical divisor on the smooth locus. This gives us a unique Weil divisor class on formula_19. It is this class, denoted by formula_47 that is referred to as the canonical divisor on formula_72

Alternately, again on a normal variety formula_19, one can consider formula_74, the formula_75&#x27;th cohomology of the normalized dualizing complex of formula_19. This sheaf corresponds to a Weil divisor class, which is equal to the divisor class formula_47 defined above. In the absence of the normality hypothesis, the same result holds if formula_19 is S2 and Gorenstein in dimension one.

==Canonical maps==
If the canonical class is effective, then it determines a rational map from &quot;V&quot; into projective space. This map is called the canonical map. The rational map determined by the &quot;n&quot;th multiple of the canonical class is the &quot;n&quot;-canonical map. The &quot;n&quot;-canonical map sends &quot;V&quot; into a projective space of dimension one less than the dimension of the global sections of the &quot;n&quot;th multiple of the canonical class. &quot;n&quot;-canonical maps may have base points, meaning that they are not defined everywhere (i.e., they may not be a morphism of varieties). They may have positive dimensional fibers, and even if they have zero-dimensional fibers, they need not be local analytic isomorphisms.

===Canonical curves===
The best studied case is that of curves. Here, the canonical bundle is the same as the (holomorphic) cotangent bundle. A global section of the canonical bundle is therefore the same as an everywhere-regular differential form. Classically, these were called differentials of the first kind. The degree of the canonical class is 2&quot;g&quot; − 2 for a curve of genus &quot;g&quot;.

====Low genus====

Suppose that &quot;C&quot; is a smooth algebraic curve of genus &quot;g&quot;. If &quot;g&quot; is zero, then &quot;C&quot; is P1, and the canonical class is the class of −2&quot;P&quot;, where &quot;P&quot; is any point of &quot;C&quot;. This follows from the calculus formula &quot;d&quot;(1/&quot;t&quot;) = −&quot;dt&quot;/&quot;t&quot;2, for example, a meromorphic differential with double pole at the origin on the Riemann sphere. In particular, &quot;K&quot;&quot;C&quot; and its multiples are not effective. If &quot;g&quot; is one, then &quot;C&quot; is an elliptic curve, and &quot;K&quot;&quot;C&quot; is the trivial bundle. The global sections of the trivial bundle form a one-dimensional vector space, so the &quot;n&quot;-canonical map for any &quot;n&quot; is the map to a point.

====Hyperelliptic case====

If &quot;C&quot; has genus two or more, then the canonical class is big, so the image of any &quot;n&quot;-canonical map is a curve. The image of the 1-canonical map is called a canonical curve. A canonical curve of genus &quot;g&quot; always sits in a projective space of dimension &quot;g&quot; − 1. When &quot;C&quot; is a hyperelliptic curve, the canonical curve is a rational normal curve, and &quot;C&quot; a double cover of its canonical curve. For example if &quot;P&quot; is a polynomial of degree 6 (without repeated roots) then

:&quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)

is an affine curve representation of a genus 2 curve, necessarily hyperelliptic, and a basis of the differentials of the first kind is given in the same notation by

:&quot;dx&quot;/,   &quot;x dx&quot;/.

This means that the canonical map is given by homogeneous coordinates [1: &quot;x&quot;] as a morphism to the projective line. The rational normal curve for higher genus hyperelliptic curves arises in the same way with higher power monomials in &quot;x&quot;.

====General case====

Otherwise, for non-hyperelliptic &quot;C&quot; which means &quot;g&quot; is at least 3, the morphism is an isomorphism of &quot;C&quot; with its image, which has degree 2&quot;g&quot; − 2. Thus for &quot;g&quot; = 3 the canonical curves (non-hyperelliptic case) are quartic plane curves. All non-singular plane quartics arise in this way. There is explicit information for the case &quot;g&quot; = 4, when a canonical curve is an intersection of a quadric and a cubic surface; and for &quot;g&quot; = 5 when it is an intersection of three quadrics. There is a converse, which is a corollary to the Riemann–Roch theorem: a non-singular curve &quot;C&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot; embedded in projective space of dimension &quot;g&quot; − 1 as a linearly normal curve of degree 2&quot;g&quot; − 2 is a canonical curve, provided its linear span is the whole space. In fact the relationship between canonical curves &quot;C&quot; (in the non-hyperelliptic case of &quot;g&quot; at least 3), Riemann-Roch, and the theory of special divisors is rather close. Effective divisors &quot;D&quot; on &quot;C&quot; consisting of distinct points have a linear span in the canonical embedding with dimension directly related to that of the linear system in which they move; and with some more discussion this applies also to the case of points with multiplicities.

More refined information is available, for larger values of &quot;g&quot;, but in these cases canonical curves are not generally complete intersections, and the description requires more consideration of commutative algebra. The field started with Max Noether&#x27;s theorem: the dimension of the space of quadrics passing through &quot;C&quot; as embedded as canonical curve is (&quot;g&quot; − 2)(&quot;g&quot; − 3)/2. Petri&#x27;s theorem, often cited under this name and published in 1923 by Karl Petri (1881–1955), states that for &quot;g&quot; at least 4 the homogeneous ideal defining the canonical curve is generated by its elements of degree 2, except for the cases of (a) trigonal curves and (b) non-singular plane quintics when &quot;g&quot; = 6. In the exceptional cases, the ideal is generated by the elements of degrees 2 and 3. Historically speaking, this result was largely known before Petri, and has been called the theorem of Babbage-Chisini-Enriques (for Dennis Babbage who completed the proof, Oscar Chisini and Federigo Enriques). The terminology is confused, since the result is also called the Noether–Enriques theorem. Outside the hyperelliptic cases, Noether proved that (in modern language) the canonical bundle is normally generated: the symmetric powers of the space of sections of the canonical bundle map onto the sections of its tensor powers. This implies for instance the generation of the quadratic differentials on such curves by the differentials of the first kind; and this has consequences for the local Torelli theorem. Petri&#x27;s work actually provided explicit quadratic and cubic generators of the ideal, showing that apart from the exceptions the cubics could be expressed in terms of the quadratics. In the exceptional cases the intersection of the quadrics through the canonical curve is respectively a ruled surface and a Veronese surface.

These classical results were proved over the complex numbers, but modern discussion shows that the techniques work over fields of any characteristic.

===Canonical rings===
The canonical ring of &quot;V&quot; is the graded ring
:formula_79
If the canonical class of &quot;V&quot; is an ample line bundle, then the canonical ring is the homogeneous coordinate ring of the image of the canonical map. This can be true even when the canonical class of &quot;V&quot; is not ample. For instance, if &quot;V&quot; is a hyperelliptic curve, then the canonical ring is again the homogeneous coordinate ring of the image of the canonical map. In general, if the ring above is finitely generated, then it is elementary to see that it is the homogeneous coordinate ring of the image of a &quot;k&quot;-canonical map, where &quot;k&quot; is any sufficiently divisible positive integer.

The minimal model program proposed that the canonical ring of every smooth or mildly singular projective variety was finitely generated. In particular, this was known to imply the existence of a canonical model, a particular birational model of &quot;V&quot; with mild singularities that could be constructed by blowing down &quot;V&quot;. When the canonical ring is finitely generated, the canonical model is Proj of the canonical ring. If the canonical ring is not finitely generated, then is not a variety, and so it cannot be birational to &quot;V&quot;; in particular, &quot;V&quot; admits no canonical model. One can show that if the canonical divisor &quot;K&quot; of &quot;V&quot; is a nef divisor and the self intersection of &quot;K&quot; is greater than zero, then &quot;V&quot; will admit a canonical model (more generally, this is true for normal complete Gorenstein algebraic spaces).

A fundamental theorem of Birkar–Cascini–Hacon–McKernan from 2006 is that the canonical ring of a smooth or mildly singular projective algebraic variety is finitely generated.

The Kodaira dimension of &quot;V&quot; is the dimension of the canonical ring minus one. Here the dimension of the canonical ring may be taken to mean Krull dimension or transcendence degree.

<text>Denver Dell Pyle (May 11, 1920 – December 25, 1997) was an American film and television actor and director. He was well known for a number of TV roles from the 1960s through the 1980s, including his portrayal of Briscoe Darling in several episodes of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show,&quot; as Jesse Duke in &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; from 1979 to 1985, as Mad Jack in the NBC television series &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot;, and as the titular character&#x27;s father, Buck Webb, in CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;. In many of his roles, he portrayed either authority figures, or gruff, demanding father figures, often as comic relief.
Perhaps his most memorable film role was that of Texas Ranger Frank Hamer in the movie &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), as the lawman who relentlessly chased down and finally killed the notorious duo in an ambush.

==Early life==
Pyle was born in Bethune, Colorado on May 11, 1920, to farmer Ben H. Pyle and his wife Maude. His brother, Willis, was an animator known for his work with Walt Disney Animation Studios and UPA. After graduating from high school, Pyle briefly attended Colorado State University, but dropped out to enter show business, moving to Los Angeles in 1940. He worked as a drummer and band member until the United States entered World War II. His military service is unclear, and he possibly enlisted in the U.S. Navy or Merchant Marines, or both.

==Career==

After the war, Pyle embarked on his film and television career. He played many bit parts on television series and movies before starring in several movies and on television during the 1950s and &#x27;60s.

===Limited roles===
Pyle guest-starred 14 times between 1951 and 1953 on the syndicated television series &quot;The Range Rider&quot; with Jock Mahoney and Dick Jones, and appeared as an outlaw in a 1951 episode of the television series &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; titled &quot;Backtrail,&quot; then as a deputy in the episode &quot;The Hooded Men&quot; and returned in episode 71 &quot;The Outcast&quot;, episode 166 &quot;Woman in the White Mask&quot; and episode 187 &quot;Cross of Santo Domingo&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Frontier Range&quot;, a 1951 episode of &quot;The Gene Autry Show&quot;.

In 1953, Pyle appeared on &quot;The Roy Rogers Show&quot; (season two, &quot;Loaded Guns&quot;) as the wrongly accused killer, ranch hand Tom Larrabee. Also in 1953, Pyle played Emil Hatch in episode 46 of &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; entitled &quot;Beware the Wrecker&quot;. He had a part in the 1955 Audie Murphy film &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, and appeared twice on NBC&#x27;s 1955–1956 Western anthology series &quot;Frontier&quot; (in &quot;Mother of the Brave&quot; and in &quot;The Voyage of Captain Castle&quot;).

Pyle was twice cast on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Public Defender&quot; in the role of George Hansen, and three times on the religious anthology series, &quot;Crossroads&quot; on ABC. He acted the part of a police detective in the 1956 film noir &quot;Please Murder Me&quot;, starring Raymond Burr.

Pyle was cast as Carter in the 1955 episode &quot;Joey&#x27;s Father&quot; on &quot;Fury&quot;. Three years later, he played an arsonist in the episode &quot;The Fire Watchers&quot; of the same series. In 1956, Pyle appeared as Vance Kiley in the episode called &quot;Quicksand&quot; in the TV Western series &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. That same year, he played &quot;Willie Calhoun&quot;, a lovestruck, and soon-to-be murderer, in season 2&#x27;s &quot;Poor Pearl&quot; on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

He appeared as a professor in the syndicated &quot;Men into Space&quot; series&#x27; 1959 episode &quot;Moonquake&quot;. In an episode of &quot;Ripcord&quot;, he played a suicidal parachutist. Also in 1959, he returned to &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, playing the lead character Mike Blocker in the episode &quot;The Bear&quot;.

Pyle appeared twice each on the CBS Western series &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Restless Gun&quot; with John Payne. He guest-starred with Grant Withers in the 1959 episode &quot;Tumbleweed Ranger&quot; of Tris Coffin&#x27;s syndicated Western series &quot;26 Men&quot;, billed as true stories of the Arizona Rangers. He appeared seven times on Richard Boone&#x27;s CBS Western &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;; his final appearance was on the show in 1960 as the character Croft in &quot;The Puppeteer&quot;.

He guest-starred in 1960 in several other Westerns, including &quot;Pony Express&quot;, &quot;The Man from Blackhawk&quot;, and &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;. He was cast as Big Red in the 1959 episode &quot;Woman in the River&quot; of the detective series &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;, starring Andrew Duggan and Richard Long. He made several appearances as Briscoe Darling, on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;.

Pyle was cast in a number of Western movies by John Ford, including &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; with William Holden and &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;. He played a Tennessee soldier (called Thimblerig) in John Wayne&#x27;s &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960). He portrayed Sam Houston in several episodes of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Jim Bowie&quot;. He guest-starred as a law-enforcement officer in Jim Davis&#x27; other syndicated series, &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, and also appeared in an episode of the ABC sitcom, &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; with Walter Brennan.

Pyle was cast in the 1960 episode &quot;Three Wise Men&quot; of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach West&quot; as an outlaw who promises to turn himself into the authorities if he can spend Christmas with his family. About this time, Pyle appeared in the segment &quot;Lawyer in Petticoats&quot; of William Bendix&#x27;s 1960 NBC Western series &quot;Overland Trail&quot; with Doug McClure, and thereafter in 1961 in &quot;Hand of Vengeance&quot; in the syndicated Western series &quot;Two Faces West&quot;. Pyle was cast as Jed Corrigan in the 1961 episode &quot;The Tramp&quot; of the NBC family drama series &quot;National Velvet&quot;.

Pyle guest-starred twice on the CBS series &quot;Route 66&quot; with Martin Milner and George Maharis, first in 1961 in the episode &quot;The Newborn&quot; and again in 1962 in &quot;A Long Piece of Mischief&quot;. He appeared as the father of the doomed family in the dystopian episode &quot;Black Leather Jackets&quot; of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

In 1963, Pyle guest-starred on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; as Uncle George in the episode &quot;Uncle George&quot;.

He appeared twice in &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, starring Clint Walker. He played Sergeant Tripp in the episode &quot;The Enemy&quot; of the James Arness ABC series &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. Pyle also had guest-starring roles on &quot;The Rifleman&quot;.

He also is known for portraying both the suspect and the murder victim on the last original &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV episode, &quot;The Case of the Final Fadeout&quot;, in 1966. He was one of 11 actors to hit the Perry Mason trifecta, portraying a victim, a defendant, and the actual murderer (in previous episodes) on the series, which he did in five appearances. Among his other appearances, he played defendant Robert Crane in &quot;The Case of the Deadly Double&quot; in 1958, Tom Quincy in &quot;The Case of the Ominous Outcast&quot; in 1960, Tilden Stuart in &quot;The Case of the Jealous Journalist&quot;, Emery Fillmore in &quot;The Case of the Renegade Refugee&quot; (both in 1961), and Frank Honer in &quot;The Case of the Shifty Shoebox&quot; in 1963.

Pyle portrayed Grandpa Tarleton in all 26 episodes of &quot;Tammy&quot; in the 1965–1966 season. Pyle portrayed the vengeful Texas Ranger Frank Hamer in the 1967 movie &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;The High Chaparral&quot; as a general who had lost his son.

In 1968, he appeared as Titus Purcell, patriarch of a family of homesteaders, in the episode &quot;The Price of Tomatoes&quot; in the sitcom &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; Working for the first time with Jim Nabors playing Gomer Pyle, spun-off from &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, he used a screen persona similar to Briscoe Darling Jr. In 1968, he also directed &quot;The Great Diamond Mines&quot; on &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

Pyle had a guest-starring role in 1973 on &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;. In 1975, Walt Disney Productions released a film based on the novel &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot;. In this film, Tony and Tia were played by Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards, Lucas Deranian by Donald Pleasence, and the children&#x27;s Uncle Bené by Pyle. In 1976, he appeared on &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Stalking Horse&quot;. He appeared as a mayor residing in the town of Purgatory in the first-season episode of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, titled &quot;Ancient Warrior&quot;. He also appeared in second-season episode &quot;Crossties&quot; as a doctor. In 1985 (season 9, episode 8), Pyle made a guest appearance on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

===Leading role===
Pyle played the titular role in a theatrical film entitled &quot;Guardian of the Wilderness&quot; (1976) about Galen Clark, the true story of an explorer who persuaded Abraham Lincoln to have the Yosemite area set aside from commercial development, the original forerunner of the American national parks system. Clark was prompted by his decision to do all he could to preserve the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias from being destroyed by loggers, along with the surrounding land. Pyle was the top-billed lead in this theatrical motion picture shot on location. John Dehner portrayed legendary naturalist John Muir and Ford Rainey played President Lincoln. The movie is also known by its alternate title &quot;Mountain Man&quot;.

===Continuing roles===
One of Pyle&#x27;s more endearing roles was that of Briscoe Darling Jr., on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1960–1966). Pyle played the patriarch of the Darling family, a group of sons (all portrayed by The Dillards), and one daughter, Charlene, portrayed by Maggie Peterson. He appeared in seven episodes, six written by the comedy-writing team of Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum.

Pyle played the role of Mad Jack in 36 episodes of the NBC series &quot;The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams&quot; (1977–1978). He played Buck Webb (Doris Day&#x27;s television series father) during the first two seasons of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot; (1968–1970). In real life, Pyle was only two years older than Day. Pyle said in 1968 that he based his acting in that role on his father&#x27;s personality.

Pyle&#x27;s best-known and longest-running television role was that of Uncle Jesse Duke in the CBS series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (1979–1985) (146 episodes).

===Later years===
In his later life, Pyle played mostly cameo television roles and retired from full-time acting. His last film role was in the 1994 film &quot;Maverick&quot;. His last known acting role was as Jesse Duke in the 1997 CBS made-for-television movie &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion!&quot;.

==Charitable efforts==
Pyle sponsored Uncle Jesse&#x27;s Fishing Tournament in Lamar County, Texas. In 10 years of operation, the tournament raised more than $160,000 to support children&#x27;s programs there. First established in 1988, the tournament is still going strong and celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017. It continues to support the children&#x27;s charities of Lamar County.

==Recognition==
Pyle has a star in the Motion Pictures section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7083 Hollywood Boulevard. It was dedicated on December 12, 1997.

In 1991, the Texas Senate passed a resolution honoring Pyle and his wife for their work with Special Olympics and the Denver Pyle&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Charities.

==Oil wealth==
Within a few years of his final episode on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;The Darling Fortune&quot;, Pyle began investing in oil, buying oil wells thought to be near the end of their working lifetimes cheaply at a time when the price of oil was $2.15 per barrel. By 1981, after new technologies allowed the remaining oil to be more economically recovered from the wells and the 1973 oil crisis triggered a rise in prices to over $46 a barrel, he was very wealthy, having made much more money from oil than his total earnings in over 30 years as an actor. He said that he continued to work as an actor because &quot;I look at it this way, acting provides the cash flow I need for oil speculation, and besides that I like acting. It&#x27;s fun.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1955, Pyle married Marilee Carpenter, a production assistant at 20th Century Fox. They had sons David and Tony. Marilee and Denver divorced in 1970. On November 5, 1983, Pyle married Tippie X. Johnston in Los Angeles County, California. That union lasted until his death.

==Death==
Pyle died of lung cancer on Christmas Day 1997. Memorial services were held January 6, 1998, at First Baptist Church in Waxahachie, Texas. He is buried in an unmarked grave at the Forreston Cemetery in Forreston, Texas. His remains are interred beside those of his second wife&#x27;s parents, James Thomas Johnston and Erin Maurine (née Birch) Johnston.

<text>Panavia Aircraft GmbH is a German company established by the three partner states of the Tornado Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) project: West Germany, Italy and the UK.

== Structure ==
The company was based and registered in West Germany. Since its founding the company is based in Hallbergmoos, a municipality in the district of Freising in Upper Bavaria, Germany.

In a similar arrangement, development of the Tornado&#x27;s RB199 turbofans is undertaken by the multinational Turbo-Union Limited based in the UK (Moor Lane, Derby).

The partner companies are:
* 42.5% Airbus (Airbus Defence and Space)
* 42.5% BAE Systems (BAE Systems Military Air &amp; Information)
* 15% Leonardo

== History ==
In the late 1960s, the British, German and Italian main defence companies looked at developing a strike aircraft together. The West Germans and Italians wanted a more short-range battlefield aircraft (something like the current A-10), but the British, specifically Air Chief Marshal Derek Hodgkinson, argued for a more long range aircraft. Negotiations took place in London, Bonn and Munich.

The NATO Multirole Combat Aircraft Development and Production Management Agency (NAMMA) was established to manage development and production of the Tornado. It was initially based in the same building as Panavia.

=== Formation ===

Panavia was established in 1969 by the British Aircraft Corporation, Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (which had formed the year before) and Fiat Aviazione (which became Aeritalia that year). It was planned to produce more than 1,000 aircraft. An aircraft was needed to counter the perceived threat from Russian aircraft such as the MiG-25 Foxbat and the Su-15 Flagon aircraft, which had been in service since around 1967. A multi-purpose aircraft was needed to allow a long production run and to lower costs per aircraft (unit price). In 1970, the unit cost was expected to be only $2.9m.

Around 1965, the UK (BAC) had been negotiating with France (Dassault Aviation) to produce the AFVG (Anglo-French Variable Geometry), which looked remarkably similar to what became the Tornado. The project failed due to the French manufacturer wanting to produce its own all-French variable geometry aircraft (the experimental Dassault Mirage G) which first flew in 1967, and never entered service, being cancelled in the 1970s. Marcel Dassault later saw the Panavia project as a direct threat to his company. Another Anglo-French defence project of the late 1960s was the SEPECAT Jaguar.

In 1959, the French and West Germans had collaborated to form Transall, which produced the Transall C-160 transport aircraft in 1963.

Canada and the Netherlands withdrew from the project in 1969 for financial reasons. The first Chairman was Allen Greenwood, of BAC in Weybridge.

In 1989, the German involvement became DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA). On 15 September 1986, the Munich offices (which also housed the Bavarian State Office for Environmental Protection) were damaged by a bomb.

=== Panavia Tornado ===


The aircraft was originally known as the MRA-75, the MRCA and the ACA. Design work began in May 1969. By 1970, it was known as the Panavia 100, with the two-seat version being the Panavia 200. The RAF was to have the two-seat version. The avionics on the aircraft were developed by another &quot;ad hoc&quot; European company, Avionica, formed by Elliott (UK), Elektronik System (West Germany) and SIA (Italy).

The Tornado first flew in 1974. The first director of flight operations was Wing Commander Roland Beamont. Marketing of the plane was directed by Jeffrey Quill from 1969–76, who had been head of marketing at SEPECAT. The RAF flew a variant, the Panavia Tornado ADV, with a larger GEC-Marconi AI.24 Foxhunter radar, implemented in the mid-1970s with the involvement of Air Chief Marshal Sir Neil Wheeler. Another variant was the Tornado ECR (Electronic Combat and Reconnaissance), developed for the Luftwaffe, and proposed to be sold to the US in 1985. Its all-weather capabilities at the time were unmatched in the world.

The Tornado aircraft is expected to remain in service until at least 2025. That would be more than fifty years after it first flew. The Tornado for the RAF and RSAF was assembled at Warton Aerodrome, then owned by British Aerospace.

=== Common organisations ===
The Tornado management model was adopted for the European Fighter Aircraft, which is now in production as the Eurofighter Typhoon. The NAMMA was replaced by the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), which is the prime contractor for the Eurofighter Weapon System and continued development of the Tornado.

In the 1970s, Euromissile was formed by West Germany and Aérospatiale of France. This company now has a similar mix to Panavia, and also includes the French, being known as MBDA.

<text>The Holston River is a river that flows from Kingsport, Tennessee, to Knoxville, Tennessee. Along with its three major forks (North Fork, Middle Fork and South Fork), it comprises a major river system that drains much of northeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, and northwestern North Carolina. The Holston&#x27;s confluence with the French Broad River at Knoxville marks the beginning of the Tennessee River.

== History ==
Maps by early French explorers in this area identified what is now known as the Holston River as the &quot;Cherokee River&quot;, after the tribe they encountered. The United States settlers and army fought with the Cherokee over land in Tennessee, North Carolina, and further South into Georgia and Alabama. In the 1830s the government forced the Cherokee out on the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), under the authority of the Indian Removal Act passed by Congress in 1830.

Early Tennessee historian and Tennessee Supreme Court Justice John Haywood cites in his 1823 book &quot;The civil and political history of the state of Tennessee from its earliest settlement up to the year 1796, including the boundaries of the state&quot;&quot;&quot; that the Holston River was identified and named on earlier produced French maps as the &quot;Cherokee River&quot;. British colonists later named the Holston River after pioneer Stephen Holstein, a European-American settler who built a cabin in 1746 on the upper reaches of the river. Similarly, Holston Mountain was named after the Holston River.

== Course ==
The North Fork flows southwest from Sharon Springs in Bland County, Virginia. The Middle Fork flows from near the western border of Wythe County, Virginia, joining the South Fork in Washington County, Virginia, southeast of Abingdon. The South Fork rises near Sugar Grove in Smyth County and flows southwest to join the North Fork at Kingsport. The Watauga River, a tributary of the South Fork Holston, flows westward from Watauga County, North Carolina.

== River modifications ==
The Holston River valley has been greatly developed for electrical power generation, both with hydroelectric dams and coal-fired steam plants. In the upper reaches, some of these plants are controlled by private interests; in the downstream portion, they are owned by the United States Government&#x27;s Tennessee Valley Authority.

The main stem of the Holston is impounded by the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s Cherokee Dam near Jefferson City, Tennessee, forming Cherokee Lake. Five other dams, also managed by TVA, impound the Holston&#x27;s headwater streams: Watauga Dam and Wilbur Dam on the Watauga River, and Boone Dam, Fort Patrick Henry Dam, and South Holston Dam on the South Fork Holston River.

Among the dams and associated reservoirs on the South Fork Holston River are Boone Dam and Boone Lake, named for the explorer Daniel Boone; Fort Patrick Henry Dam and Fort Patrick Henry Lake, named for the Founding Father Patrick Henry; and South Holston Dam and South Holston Lake.

==Recreation==

All three forks in Virginia, South Holston Lake, and the Holston River in Tennessee below the South Holston Dam offer relatively easy-to-reach recreation opportunities. The North Fork in Virginia is known as an excellent smallmouth bass river (because of mercury contamination, fish caught in the North Fork of the Holston below Saltville, Virginia, must not be consumed). Both the South Fork in Virginia and the first of the Holston in Tennessee below South Holston Dam are quality brown trout and rainbow trout fisheries. The Holston River is wide and open enough to allow extensive fly fishing. South Holston Lake offers a variety of fishing opportunity as well, as it contains smallmouth bass, common carp, walleye, pike, sunfish, crappie and a few trout.

<text>Inner Wheel is an international women&#x27;s organisation to create friendship, service and understanding. It has clubs in over 100 countries with over 100,000 members. It was founded in Manchester.

==History==
The organisation was officially founded on 10 January 1924 by Margarette Golding, a nurse, business woman and the wife of a Manchester Rotarian, who met with 26 other wives of Rotarians in November 1923. The first official Inner Wheel meeting was held on 10 January 1924 – this date is now known as &quot;International Inner Wheel Day&quot;. This organisation was originally established for the wives and daughters of Rotarians although no Rotary connection is now required. Gradually other groups formed themselves into Inner Wheel Clubs and in 1934 the Association of Inner Wheel Clubs in Great Britain and Ireland was formed.

The number of clubs around the world grew and in 1967 the International Inner Wheel came into being. There are clubs in many countries around the world. Inner Wheel clubs are grouped into districts with twenty-nine districts within Great Britain and Ireland. Most clubs meet monthly, often with a speaker at the meeting but members meet socially on a regular basis. Clubs raise and donate money to a huge variety of charities.

Helena Foster, who was the President in 1969–70, proposed that &quot;Inner Wheel Day&quot; should be celebrated on 10 January each year on the day that the original Manchester group adopted the name of &quot;Inner Wheel&quot; in 1924.
Following the decision taken at an International Convention in 2012, membership was opened up to all women over the age of 18.

The International Inner Wheel objectives are (a) promoting true friendship, (b) encouraging the ideals of personal service, and (c) fostering international understanding.

In 2008, Inner Wheel had over 100,000 members in 102 countries and was one of the largest women&#x27;s organisations with consultative status at the United Nations.

<text>Confrontation is the thirteenth and final studio album by Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers and the only one to be released posthumously in May 1983, two years after Marley&#x27;s death. The songs were compiled from unreleased material and singles recorded during Marley&#x27;s lifetime. Many of the tracks were built up from demos, most notably &quot;Jump Nyabinghi&quot; where vocals from the I-Threes were added, which were not there when Marley released the song as a dubplate in 1979. In addition the harmony vocals on &quot;Blackman Redemption&quot; and &quot;Rastaman Live Up&quot; are performed by the I-Threes in order to give the album a consistent sound – on the original single versions they are performed by the Meditations. The most famous track on the album is &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;.

The album cover depicts Bob Marley taking the role as the military saint Saint George slaying the dragon which symbolizes Babylon. Perhaps not coincidentally, this motif was also displayed on the reverse of the imperial standard of Rastafari icon Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, though the direct model for the album art is a British recruitment poster from World War I. Inside the album sleeve is an artist&#x27;s depiction of the Battle of Adowa where Ethiopian forces defeated Italy in 1896.

<text>The Higgins Armory Museum is a collection in the Worcester Art Museum. It was formerly a separate museum located in the nearby Higgins Armory Building in Worcester, Massachusetts, dedicated to the display of arms and armor. It was &quot;the only museum in the country devoted solely to arms and armor&quot; and had the second largest arms and armor collection in the country from its founding in 1931 until 2004, behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The collection consists of 2,000 objects, including 24 full suits of armor. The museum closed at the end of 2013 due to a lack of funding. Its collection and endowment were transferred and integrated into the Worcester Art Museum, with the collection on show in its own gallery. The former museum building was sold in December 2014 and now serves as a local events venue.

==History==
John Woodman Higgins was a prominent industrialist in Worcester, Massachusetts who owned the Worcester Pressed Steel Company. He traveled to Europe multiple times throughout the 1920s where he collected arms, armor, and other steel items. One of his most important purchases was eight full suits of armor from the collection of George Jay Gould in 1927. Originally, he stored these items in his house, which quickly filled with anything that he could find made of steel, from suits of armor to automatic shoe polishers. Higgins incorporated his collection as a museum in 1928; the collection grew larger than his house could hold, so he began construction on a steel and glass museum building next to his factory in 1929.

&quot;The Museum of Steel and Glass&quot; opened on January 12, 1931 with a grand gala. Music was played by members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Higgins&#x27; sons dressed in suits of armor. In its original layout, the museum displayed a wide variety of objects constructed of steel including &quot;medieval weaponry, automobile parts, and even ... an all-steel airplane suspended from its ceiling.&quot; Admission to the museum began with a walk through the armor exhibits and ended with a tour through the production lines to see modern steel manufacturing. The production floor was accessed through catwalks connecting the factory and the armory. Higgins invited visitors to the museum across these catwalks, and he also invited his workers to visit the museum on breaks to get inspired. Higgins died in 1961, leaving the museum a endowment.

==Collection in Worcester Art Museum==
The collection today is spread throughout the museum by time period, uniting period armor with artworks depicting armor, such as paintings and sculpture. Each first Saturday of the month demonstrations of armor in various fighting styles from the collection are given, to enable visitors to better place the artifacts in historic context. The museum continues the collection&#x27;s educational programs on medieval history and arms and armor, ranging from school workshops and teacher education to scholarly lectures. The Olive Higgins Prouty Research Library, founded in 1997 with an initial collection of &quot;several thousand books on arms and armor&quot; also remains in the collection.

The Higgins Armory was a major center of study for Western martial arts. Scholars associated with the museum such as curator Jeffrey Forgeng, William Short, and Ken Mondschein produced monographs and translations, gave papers and sponsored sessions at scholarly conferences, and lectured and demonstrated both in the US and Europe. The Higgins Armory Sword Guild was a study group founded in part by Patri J. Pugliese that conducted research into Western martial arts and demonstrated at the museum and in the community. The former museum also held historical fencing and martial arts classes.

The collection consists of 2,000 objects, making it the second largest arms and armor collection in the country behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The collection includes 24 full suits of armor, a gladiator helmet, and &quot;Helmutt,&quot; a dog mannequin dressed in reproduction boarhound armor. The oldest object in the collection is an Eastern Mediterranean dagger from between 3000 and 1500 B.C.

The collection includes gladiator and Corinthian helmets, gauntlets from the Renaissance period, and the helmet of a 19th-century French cuirassier. There are also pieces that depict the courtly life: helmets for jousting tournaments, a crossbow for hunting, a ceremonial gorget, and an anvil that was used to manufacture such pieces.

There are knives and axes from Africa, bow case covers from ancient Islam, a horned &quot;kulah khud&quot; (helmet) from India, and samurai armor from Japan, among others. The collection also includes examples of armor for dogs and horses. There are also full-scale models of jousts and foot tourneys.

==In popular media==
Norman Rockwell drew an imagined scene in the Higgins armory museum entitled &quot;Midnight Snack&quot; for the November 3, 1962 cover of The Saturday Evening Post.

Higgins Armory Museum has been featured on the History Channel on multiple occasions, including a special DVD extra that focused solely on the museum.

In April 2011, the TV show &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; filmed an episode at the museum to see if the ghost of Mr. Higgins haunted the building.

<text>57 Mnemosyne is a large main belt asteroid. It is a stony S-type asteroid in composition. This object was discovered by Robert Luther on 22 September 1859 in Düsseldorf. Its name was chosen by Martin Hoek, the director of the Utrecht Observatory, in reference to Mnemosyne, a Titaness in Greek mythology.

This asteroid is orbiting in the outer main belt at a distance of from the Sun with an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.118 and a period of . The orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 15.2° to the ecliptic. The orbital period of this asteroid is close to a 2:1 commensurability with Jupiter, which made it useful for perturbation measurements to derive the mass of the planet.

Photometry measurements made at the Oakley Observatory during 2006 produced a lightcurve with a rotation period of and an amplitude of in magnitude. 
Subsequent observations at Organ Mesa Observatory in 2019 showed this period was not a good fit to a longer light curve. A period of was adopted; roughly double the original period. It has an estimated span of and a mass of .

<doc id="734965" wikidata="Q1187254" url="?curid=734965" title="Mask (Vangelis album)">
<text>Mask (sometimes The Mask) is an album by the Greek electronic music composer Vangelis released in March 1985. It was the last he produced for the Polydor label. It is dramatic work in six movements, with somewhat dark mood and classical style which branches into ethnic styles. The album reached #69 position in the UK album charts.

==Composition==
It is arranged like a symphony or suite, divided into movements with different moods. The 4th movement features complex percussion, with reminiscence to West African tribal drumming.

Vangelis plays all instruments, mainly synthesizers, himself. There is choral input on all tracks, and a solo male vocal on the fourth track, but all are uncredited. The choir, as in Vangelis&#x27; other choral work, sings seemingly random syllables chosen for their timbre. Similarly, the male tenor vocal of track 4 sings lyrics in a made-up language that resembles Latin. In later interviews it was revealed that the choir is probably the English Chamber Choir and that the male vocalist is Guy Protheroe; the choir also featured on &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1975).

Specific synthesizer patches are Vangelis&#x27; strings and brass, a piano (track 3), a marimba-like sequence (track 4), sharp arpeggio sequences (tracks 1 and 5) and a deep mallet percussion (track 5). Timpani and snare drums are the main percussion instruments; both appear to be samples (Emulator I/Emulator II).

==Track listing==
All songs written by Vangelis.
#&quot;Movement 1&quot; – 10:18
#&quot;Movement 2&quot; – 3:26
#&quot;Movement 3&quot; – 6:38
#&quot;Movement 4&quot; – 8:41

<text>58 Concordia is a fairly large main-belt asteroid that is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.44 years, a semimajor axis of , and a low eccentricity of 0.043. It is classified as a C-type asteroid, meaning that its surface is very dark and it is likely carbonaceous in composition. The surface spectra displays indications of hydrated minerals created through aqueous alteration. The object is rotating with a sidereal period of and pole orientations of (, ) and (, ). It belongs to the Hungaria family of asteroids and has a satellite with an orbital period of 14.29 h.

Concordia was discovered by German astronomer Robert Luther on March 24, 1860. At Luther&#x27;s request, it was named by Carl Christian Bruhns of the University of Leipzig after Concordia, the Roman goddess of harmony.

<doc id="734974" wikidata="Q155717" url="?curid=734974" title="59 Elpis">
<text>59 Elpis is a large main belt asteroid that orbits the Sun with a period of 4.47 years. It is a C-type asteroid, meaning that it is very dark and carbonaceous in composition. In the Tholen scheme it has a classification of CP, while Bus and Binzen class it as type B.

Elpis was discovered by Jean Chacornac from Paris, on September 12, 1860. It was Chacornac&#x27;s sixth and final asteroid discovery.

A controversy arose over the naming of Elpis. Urbain Le Verrier, director of the Paris Observatory, at first refused to allow Chacornac to name the object, because Leverrier was promoting a plan to reorganize asteroid nomenclature by naming them after their discoverers, rather than mythological figures. A protest arose among astronomers. At the Vienna Observatory, Edmund Weiss, who had been studying the asteroid, asked the observatory&#x27;s director, Karl L. Littrow, to name it. Littrow chose Elpis, a Greek personification of hope, in reference to the favorable political conditions in Europe at the time. In 1862, Leverrier permitted Chacornac to choose a name, and he selected &quot;Olympia&quot; at the suggestion of John Russell Hind. However, Elpis is the name that stuck.

Elpis has been studied by radar.

<text>60 Echo is a quite large main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by James Ferguson of the United States Naval Observatory in Washington D.C., on September 14, 1860. It was his third and final asteroid discovery. It is named after Echo, a nymph in Greek mythology. James Ferguson had initially named it &quot;Titania&quot;, not realizing that name was already used for a satellite of Uranus.

This object is orbiting the Sun with a period of , a semimajor axis of , and an eccentricity of 0.18. Its orbital plane is at an inclination of 3.6° to the plane of the ecliptic. This is a stony S-type asteroid with a cross-sectional size of 60.2 km that is spinning with a rotation period of 25.2 hr. Echo has been studied by radar.

<text>Beat the Teacher is a British children&#x27;s game show that aired on BBC1 from 24 September 1984 to 27 October 1988. It was first hosted by Howard Stableford in 1984, then hosted by Paul Jones from 1985 to 1986 and finally Bruno Brookes from 1987 to 1988.

==Show format==
Each edition featured two contestants; one a school student and the other a teacher. Both were tested on general knowledge questions and logic puzzles.

Correct answers won the contestant moves on a giant Noughts and Crosses board made from rotating cubes. Questions awarded one, two or three moves of the board, based upon their difficulty. Control of the board was determined by the use of buzzers. After answering the question correctly, the contestant was given the choice of which blocks on the board to turn over.

For example, if a square displayed a &quot;nought&quot;, one rotation would see the square turn blank; two would see it replaced with a &quot;cross&quot;, three with another blank and on the fourth turn it would revert to a &quot;nought&quot;.

Tactical play would lead to the contestant building up lines of noughts or crosses, for which points were awarded (10 points per horizontal, vertical or diagonal line).

A special &quot;joker card&quot; could be played once in each game by either contestant, reversing each square on the board so that all crosses became noughts and vice versa. A bonus was awarded for a full board of noughts or crosses, after which each square on the board would be randomised.

Question styles generally included puzzles, &quot;true or false,&quot; or &quot;identify the picture&quot;. In later series, the last round played by both contestants before the winner was revealed was a &quot;wrong answer&quot; round, in which the aim was for each contestant to give as many &quot;incorrect &quot; answers as possible within 60 seconds.

The player with the highest score at the end would be crowned champion and participate in the &quot;final&quot; round. The board was cleared, and the winning contestant had to try to fill all nine squares up by answering nine questions correctly within 60 seconds. If they accomplished this, they would win a prize. Whether they won or not they were invited to come back again the next episode. A &quot;Beat the Teacher&quot; Failure Mug was the consolation prize awarded to a majority of the show&#x27;s unsuccessful contestants.

Once a contestant won five games in a row, they would &quot;retire&quot; undefeated (although this rule was waived for the final series, which saw one contestant win thirteen episodes in a row before being defeated). The best four students and the best four teachers from each series in terms of total number of wins and then total scores achieved in their episodes (excluding the final round) would return for the quarter-finals at the end of the series

<doc id="734995" wikidata="Q578605" url="?curid=734995" title="Epic Cycle">
<text>The Epic Cycle () was a collection of Ancient Greek epic poems, composed in dactylic hexameter and related to the story of the Trojan War, including the &quot;Cypria&quot;, the &quot;Aethiopis&quot;, the so-called &quot;Little Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Iliupersis&quot;, the &quot;Nostoi&quot;, and the &quot;Telegony&quot;. Scholars sometimes include the two Homeric epics, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, among the poems of the Epic Cycle, but the term is more often used to specify the non-Homeric poems as distinct from the Homeric ones.

Unlike the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the cyclic epics survive only in fragments and summaries from Late Antiquity and the Byzantine period.

The Epic Cycle was the distillation in literary form of an oral tradition that had developed during the Greek Dark Age, which was based in part on localised hero cults. The traditional material from which the literary epics were drawn treats Mycenaean Bronze Age culture from the perspective of Iron Age and later Greece.

In modern scholarship, the study of the historical and literary relationship between the Homeric epics and the rest of the cycle is called Neoanalysis.

A longer Epic Cycle, as described by the 9th-century CE scholar and clergyman Photius in codex 239 of his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, also included the &quot;Titanomachy&quot; (8th century BCE) and the Theban Cycle (between 750 and 500 BCE), which in turn comprised the &quot;Oedipodea&quot;, the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, the &quot;Epigoni&quot;, and the &quot;Alcmeonis&quot;; however, it is certain that none of the cyclic epics (other than Homer&#x27;s) survived to Photius&#x27; day, and it is likely that Photius was not referring to a canonical collection. Modern scholars do not normally include the Theban Cycle when referring to the Epic Cycle.

==Contents==
==Evidence ==
Herodotus knew of the &quot;Cypria&quot; and the &quot;Epigoni&quot; when he wrote his &quot;History&quot; in the mid-5th century BCE. He rejected the Homeric authorship for the former and questioned it for the latter.

The Epic Cycle was not &quot;mentioned as a whole&quot; (including the Theban Cycle) until the 2nd century CE, but knowledge of a &quot;Trojan cycle&quot; is apparent from at least the 4th century BCE as Aristoxenus mentions an alternative opening to the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

Aristotle, in his &quot;Poetics,&quot; criticizes the &quot;Cypria&quot; and &quot;Little Iliad&quot; for the piecemeal character of their plots:
&quot;The Library&quot; attributed to Apollodorus and the 2nd century CE Latin &quot;Genealogia&quot; attributed to Hyginus also drew on them. Furthermore, there are also the Tabula iliaca inscriptions that cover the same myths.

Most knowledge of the Cyclic epics comes from a broken summary of them which serves as part of the preface to the famous 10th century &quot;Iliad&quot; manuscript known as Venetus A. This preface is damaged, missing the &quot;Cypria&quot;, and has to be supplemented by other sources (the &quot;Cypria&quot; summary is preserved in several other manuscripts, each containing only the &quot;Cypria&quot; and none of the other epics). The summary is, in turn, an excerpt from a longer work, &quot;Chrestomathy&quot;, written by a &quot;Proclus.&quot; This is known from evidence provided by the later scholar Photius, mentioned above. Photius provides sufficient information about Proclus&#x27; &quot;Chrestomathy&quot; to demonstrate that the Venetus A excerpt is derived from the same work. Little is known about Proclus. He is certainly not the philosopher Proclus Diadochus. Some have thought that it might be the same person as the lesser-known grammarian Eutychius Proclus, who lived in the 2nd century CE, but it is quite possible that he is simply an otherwise unknown figure.

In antiquity, the two Homeric epics were considered the greatest works in the Cycle. For Hellenistic scholars, the Cyclic poets, the authors to whom the other poems were commonly ascribed, were νεώτεροι (&quot;neōteroi&quot; &quot;later poets&quot;) and κυκλικός (&quot;kyklikos&quot; &quot;cyclic&quot;) was synonymous with &quot;formulaic.&quot; Then, and in much modern scholarship, there has been an equation between poetry that is later and poetry that is inferior.

The tales told in the Cycle are recounted by other ancient sources, notably Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (book 2), which recounts the sack of Troy from a Trojan perspective, and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (books 13–14), which describes the Greeks&#x27; landing at Troy (from the &quot;Cypria&quot;) and the judgment of Achilles&#x27; arms (&quot;Little Iliad&quot;). Quintus of Smyrna&#x27;s &quot;Posthomerica&quot; is another source, which narrates the events after Hector&#x27;s death up until the end of the war. The death of Agamemnon and the vengeance taken by his son Orestes (the &quot;Nostoi&quot;) are the subjects of later Greek tragedy, especially Aeschylus&#x27;s Oresteian trilogy.

==Compilation==
The non-Homeric epics are usually regarded as later than the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. There is no reliable evidence for this, however, and some Neoanalyst scholars operate on the premise that the Homeric epics were later than the Cyclic epics and drew on them extensively. Other Neoanalysts make the milder claim that the Homeric epics draw on legendary material which later crystallized into the Epic Cycle.

The nature of the relationship between the Cyclic epics and Homer is also bound up in this question. As told by Proclus, the plots of the six non-Homeric epics look very much as though they are designed to integrate with Homer, with no overlaps with one another.

For example, a surviving quotation shows that the &quot;Little Iliad&quot; narrated how Neoptolemus took Andromache prisoner after the fall of Troy; however, in Proclus, the &quot;Little Iliad&quot; stops before the sack of Troy begins. Some scholars have argued that the &quot;Cypria&quot; as originally planned dealt with more of the Trojan War than Proclus&#x27; summary suggests; conversely, others argue that it was designed to lead up to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and that Proclus&#x27; account reflects the &quot;Cypria&quot; as originally designed.

It is probable that at least some editing or &quot;stitching&quot; was done to edit epics together. For the last line of the &quot;Iliad&quot;,
ὣς οἵ γ᾽ ἀμφίεπον τάφον Ἕκτορος ἱπποδάμοιο.
In this way they performed the funeral of Hector, tamer of horses.
an alternative reading is preserved which is designed to lead directly into the &quot;Aethiopis&quot;:
ὣς οἵ γ&#x27; ἀμφίεπον τάφον Ἕκτορος· ἦλθε δ&#x27; Ἀμαζών,
Ἄρηος θυγάτηρ μεγαλήτορος ἀνδροφόνοιο.
In this way they performed the funeral of Hector; then the Amazon Penthesileia came,
daughter of great-hearted man-slaughtering Ares. ...
There are contradictions between epics in the Cycle. For example, the Greek warrior who killed Hector&#x27;s son Astyanax in the fall of Troy is Neoptolemus according to the &quot;Little Iliad&quot;; according to the &quot;Iliou persis&quot;, it is Odysseus.

How and when the eight epics of the Cycle came to be combined into a single collection and referred to as a &quot;cycle&quot; is a matter of ongoing debate. In the late 19th century, David Binning Monro argued that the scholastic use of the word κυκλικός did not refer to the Cycle as such, but meant &quot;conventional&quot;, and that the Cycle was compiled in the Hellenistic period (perhaps as late as the 1st century BCE). More recent scholars have preferred to push the date slightly earlier, but accept the general thrust of the argument.

<text>61 Danaë () is a stony (S-type) asteroid in the outer asteroid belt&#x27;s background population, approximately 84 kilometer in diameter. It was discovered by French astronomer Hermann Goldschmidt on 9 September 1860, from his balcony in Paris, France. Goldschmidt was ill when asked to name the asteroid, and requested his fellow asteroid-hunter Robert Luther to name it instead. Luther chose to name it after Danaë, the mother of Perseus in Greek mythology. Danaë was the first asteroid to have a diacritical character in its official name.

The asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of 5.15 years and is rotating on its axis once every 11.45 hours. In 1985, a study of lightcurve data suggested that Danaë may have a moon. If so, the main body would be an ellipsoid measuring , and the moon would orbit away, measuring . The density of both would be .

<text>Trujillo () is a municipality located in Extremadura, an autonomous community of Spain in the Province of Cáceres. In 2013 the municipality had 9,086 inhabitants (INE Census, 2013). Originally settled on a granite knoll, which was readily fortified, the town now extends to the southeast of its original site. Trujillo is both a centre for tourism, with more than 25 hotels, and a regional market town.

The old town contains many medieval and renaissance buildings.

It hosts the national cheese festival in early May.

== History ==
Trujillo was settled on a granite batholith during Prehistoric times. In Roman times the town was known as &quot;Turgalium&quot; and became a prefecture stipendiary of the Lusitanian capital, Emerita Augusta (today&#x27;s Mérida). Later it was colonised by East Germanic tribes (mainly Visigoths), although most of the population would still have been Hispano-Roman.

Following the Islamic conquest after 711, Trujillo became one of the main towns in the region (known as ترجالة &quot;Turjaala&quot; in Arabic). This taifa was subject to the Umayyad Emirate and the subsequent Caliphate ruled until the middle of the 11th century. During this time the ethnic tensions between Berbers and Arabs weakened the Caliphate militarily.

Following the seizure of a large part of the territory of the former Taifa of Toledo by the Almoravids from Alfonso VI, Trujillo became a site from where Almoravid &quot;razzias&quot; were launched against the land of Talavera in the early 12th century.

During the time of Almohad rule, wars with Portugal, Castile and León guaranteed that the possession of Trujillo was tenuous. Rule alternated between these kingdoms and the Almohads, returning for the last time to the Muslims in 1195. Between 1188 and 1195 it was the headquarters of the military order of Trujillo.

In the Spring of 1196, with help from the Kingdom of León, Almohads raided the Tagus valley and occupied Santa Cruz and Trujillo, which had been previously left forsaken by the order of Trujillo.

An army formed by forces of the military orders and the Bishop of Plasencia laid siege to Trujillo with the support of Ferdinand III. Ibn Hud tried to relieve the town but was driven off by the besieging army.

The town was finally captured on 25 January 1232. During the final assault, according to the local legend, the Christian forces were faltering just short of victory when many reported seeing the Virgin Mary (known as &quot;Virgen de la Victoria&quot; in Spanish, or the &quot;Virgin Mary of Victory&quot;) between the two towers, or &quot;Arco del Triunfo,&quot; in the castle. Sufficiently inspired, Christian troops pressed on and achieved victory, defeating the Muslims, who were inside.

Together with Plasencia, Cáceres and Coria, Trujillo was one of the few major royal demesne towns in the region, where otherwise &quot;maestrazgo&quot; lands tended to prevail.

Alfonso X granted Trujillo a &quot;fuero&quot; in 1256.

John II conferred on Trujillo the status of city (&quot;ciudad&quot;) in 1430 by means of a &quot;&quot;. Later there was a Jewish quarter outside the powerful medieval walls. Trujillo, with the growth of the population, was gradually extended beyond the walls.

Explorers from Trujillo, called &quot;Trujillanos&quot;, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the Western Hemisphere. On their return they built majestic palaces near the Plaza Mayor and surrounds, most of which can now be visited. Francisco Pizarro, an explorer from Trujillo, came back and helped enrich his family in the Plaza Mayor. His daughter by an Incan princess returned at the age of 17, married her uncle and lived the rest of her life in Trujillo as a lady of great estate.

After 1595 the city experienced the arrival of a number of forcibly relocated &#x27;new moriscos&#x27; banished from Granada. From 1610 to 1611, about 130 &quot;morisco&quot; families (590 individuals) were reportedly expelled from Trujillo, although the permanence of a number of &#x27;old moriscos&#x27;, who enjoyed support from the local society, remained a cause of concern.

During the War for Independence, one of the first authorities that responded to the call of the Junta of Móstoles in May 1808 was the mayor of Trujillo, Antonio Martin Rivas, who prepared enlistments of volunteers, with food and arms, plus the mobilization of troops, to go to the aid of the Junta. Trujillo was captured by the French in 1811 and held until 1812.

In 1834, the city became the official headquarters of the Judicial District of Trujillo. In the census of 1842, it had 110 households and 6026 residents.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

Trujillo has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, type &quot;Csa&quot;, in the modified Köppen classification.
=== Ecology ===
As in many towns in Extremadura, Trujillo&#x27;s old buildings provide homes for a breeding population of storks. Other birds of interest include the Lesser kestrel, which nests in the bull-ring and other urban sites.

== Monuments ==
Trujillo has a rich heritage. Among the most important monuments are the Castle (Alcazaba), the church of Santiago, the church of &quot;Santa María la Mayor&quot;, the church of &quot;San Francisco&quot;, the Church of &quot;San Martín&quot;, the &quot;Plaza Mayor&quot;, and renaissance palaces such as the palace of the Marquis of the Conquest, the palace of the Orellana-Pizarro family, the palace of the Duques de San Carlos, Marquesado de Piedras Albas, the house of the strong Altamirano, Palace Chaves (Luis Chaves Old), and of course the walled old town.

The Palacio de Piedras Albas was built circa 1530 by Don Pedro Suárez de Toledo, formerly owned by the family of the conquistador and explorer Francisco de Orellana, the Marqueses de Orellana and later by the Marqueses de San Juan de Piedras Albas.

The city has several museums, including the Museum of Coria (Javier Salas Foundation), Pizarro&#x27;s House, Enrique Elías Museum (local designer), and the Museum of Cheese and Wine.

== Events ==

=== The &quot;Chiviri&quot; ===
The culmination of Holy Week is celebrated on Easter Sunday (declared an event of regional interest). The town square is full of people dressed in local costumes. They sing, dance, eat and drink to the beat of Chíviri. The following day, Easter Monday, is a holiday in the city and locals have the custom of going to the countryside for picnics.

===National Cheese Fair===
On 1 May, the National Cheese Fair takes place, which is the most important cheese competition in Spain. The &quot;Plaza Mayor&quot; becomes a huge fair where it is possible to taste cheeses from around Spain. This festival draws a large crowd, with organizers reporting that approximately 100,000 people attend on a yearly basis.

=== Festivities in honour of &quot;Virgen de la Victoria&quot; ===
They take place at the end of August or in early September. During the festival the Virgen de la Victoria (Our Lady of Victory) is moved from her normal place in the chapel of the Castle to the church of San Martín, in the &quot;Plaza Mayor&quot;, where the religious events are celebrated. In addition, there are puppets (The Adventures of &quot;Peneque el Valiente&quot; (Peneque the brave) with Miguel Pino), capeas and the Festival of Music, Dance and Theatre in the Castle. Also a local teenager is elected as &quot;Queen of the festivities&quot; and she has her own entourage.

<doc id="735009" wikidata="Q14313" url="?curid=735009" title="Pharrell Williams">
<text>Pharrell Lanscilo Williams (; born April 5, 1973), also known mononymously as Pharrell, is an American musician, record producer, singer, songwriter, rapper, and fashion designer. He first became known as one half of the music production duo the Neptunes, which he formed with Chad Hugo in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sony/ATV&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 15 of their productions have peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, which includes four songs that peaked atop the chart. The two also formed the rock and hip-hop band N.E.R.D. with Shay Haley in 1999, for which Williams served as lead vocalist. He has been regarded as one of the most influential producers in modern popular music.

Williams co-founded the record label Star Trak Entertainment with Hugo in 2001, as an imprint of Arista Records. Williams&#x27; 2003 debut single, &quot;Frontin&#x27;&quot; (featuring Jay-Z), peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He then signed with Virgin and Interscope Records to release his debut studio album, &quot;In My Mind&quot; (2006), which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 despite mixed critical reception. Williams produced and guest performed alongside T.I. on Star Trak signee Robin Thicke&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;, which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). That same year, his guest appearance alongside Nile Rodgers on Daft Punk&#x27;s single &quot;Get Lucky&quot; peaked at number two on the chart and won Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. Williams&#x27; 2013 single, &quot;Happy&quot;—released for the soundtrack to the animated film &quot;Despicable Me 2&quot;—became his second song to peak atop the chart that same year. It also served as lead single for his second album, &quot;Girl&quot; (2014), which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and saw positive critical reception.

Williams has received numerous accolades and nominations. He has won 13 Grammy Awards, including three for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (one as a member of the Neptunes). He is also a two-time Academy Award nominee: in 2014 for Best Original Song for &quot;Happy&quot;; and in 2017 for Best Picture as a producer of &quot;Hidden Figures&quot;. As sole proprietor, he founded the multi-disciplinary media company I Am Other in 2014, which acts as both a record label and creative umbrella for his other endeavors, including his fashion label and retailer, Billionaire Boys Club. He has served as Men&#x27;s creative director for Louis Vuitton since 2023.

==Early life==
Pharrell Lanscilo Williams was born on April 5, 1973, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, the eldest of the three sons of teacher Carolyn and handyman Williams. His ancestry goes back many generations in Virginia and North Carolina. One of his ancestors journeyed to West Africa in 1831, prompting other relatives to emigrate from the U.S. to Liberia in 1832. Williams met Chad Hugo in a seventh-grade summer band camp, where Williams played drums and Hugo played tenor saxophone. They attended Princess Anne High School where they were in the school&#x27;s band, the Fabulous Marching Cavaliers. Williams graduated from high school in 1991 and he attended Northwestern University for two years before dropping out.

==Career==
===1992–2004: The Neptunes and N.E.R.D.===
In the early 1990s, Williams formed a hip-hop group named Surrounded by Idiots with Chad Hugo, Magoo, and cousin Timbaland; they disbanded before making any records. He then formed a four-piece &quot;R&amp;B-type&quot; group, the Neptunes, with Hugo and friends Shay Haley and Mike Etheridge. They entered a high school talent show, where they were discovered by producer Teddy Riley, whose studio was next to the school. After graduating, the group signed with Riley.

Williams wrote Riley&#x27;s verse on Wreckx-n-Effect&#x27;s 1992 hit &quot;Rump Shaker&quot;. As the Neptunes, Williams and Hugo produced Noreaga&#x27;s 1998 single &quot;Superthug&quot;. The Neptunes began working with rap duo Clipse (rappers Pusha T and Malice) in the late 1990s, and worked on Clipse&#x27;s album &quot;Exclusive Audio Footage&quot;, which was not released.

The Neptunes produced Mystikal&#x27;s single &quot;Shake Ya Ass&quot; (2000), Jay-Z&#x27;s single &quot;I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)&quot; (2000), and Nelly&#x27;s single &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; (2002). They worked with singer Kelis, producing her first two studio albums, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1999) and &quot;Wanderland&quot; (2001). In 2001, N.E.R.D., a band composed of Williams, Hugo, and Haley, released their debut album &quot;In Search of...&quot;. Williams and Hugo signed Clipse to Arista Records through Williams&#x27; Star Trak Entertainment imprint in 2001. The Neptunes produced songs on singer Babyface&#x27;s 2001 album, &quot;Face2Face&quot;, including its lead single &quot;There She Goes&quot;. The Neptunes produced the Britney Spears songs &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; for her third studio album, &quot;Britney&quot; (2001).

In 2002, Clipse released their debut album, &quot;Lord Willin&#x27;&quot;, with produced entirely by the Neptunes. That year, the Neptunes produced numerous songs on Justin Timberlake&#x27;s debut album &quot;Justified&quot;, including the singles &quot;Señorita&quot;, &quot;Like I Love You&quot;, and &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;. In 2003, the Neptunes released a compilation album, &quot;Clones&quot;. According to an unnamed August 2003 survey cited by &quot;The Age&quot;, it was found the Neptunes produced almost 20% of songs played on British radio at the time; another survey in the U.S. found they&#x27;d produced 43% of radio songs. The Neptunes produced Snoop Dogg&#x27;s single &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot; (2004), which also featured vocals from Williams.

=== 2005–2009: &quot;In My Mind&quot; and collaborations ===
The Neptunes produced Gwen Stefani&#x27;s single &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot;, which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 82 on the issue dated April 2, 2005, and topped the chart within six weeks of its release. In 2006, Williams released his debut solo album, &quot;In My Mind&quot;. It debuted at number 3 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The Neptunes produced Clipse&#x27;s second album, &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;. The Neptunes produced several songs on Stefani&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; (2006), including the promotional single, &quot;Yummy&quot;, which features Williams. In December 2006, Williams was announced as a performer at Concert for Diana in Wembley Stadium, London on July 1, 2007. In 2007, the Neptunes produced on Jay-Z&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;American Gangster&quot;.

Williams worked with Madonna for her eleventh studio album, &quot;Hard Candy&quot; (2008). In June 2008, an article in &quot;NME&quot; revealed that Williams was interested in producing the next album of American rock band the Strokes. Later that year, Williams worked on a remix album for Maroon 5, titled &quot;Call and Response: The Remix Album&quot;. N.E.R.D. released their third studio album, &quot;Seeing Sounds&quot;, in 2008.

Williams worked with Shakira on her songs &quot;Did It Again&quot;, &quot;Why Wait&quot;, &quot;Good Stuff&quot;, and &quot;Long Time&quot; for her sixth studio album, &quot;She Wolf&quot; (2009). The following month, Williams made a guest appearance on French singer Uffie&#x27;s debut album, which was released in early 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Busy P Blog 10/03/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Neptunes produced numerous songs on Clipse&#x27;s third album, &quot;Til the Casket Drops&quot; (2009).

In 2013, Williams collaborated with French electronic duo Daft Punk on the songs &quot;Get Lucky&quot; and &quot;Lose Yourself to Dance&quot;, both included on Daft Punk&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;. &quot;Get Lucky&quot; peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2013, Williams collaborated with Azealia Banks with the song &quot;ATM Jam&quot;. The song was initially intended for Banks&#x27; debut studio album, &quot;Broke with Expensive Taste&quot; (2014), but was later removed from the album after Banks blamed Williams for the song&#x27;s poor commercial performance. Williams penned three new original songs, included alongside composer Heitor Pereira&#x27;s score, for the film &quot;Despicable Me 2&quot; (2013). These were &quot;Just a Cloud Away&quot;, &quot;Happy&quot;, and &quot;Scream&quot; (featuring CeeLo Green). His two original songs from the first film, &quot;Despicable Me&quot; and &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;, were also reprised on the &quot;Despicable Me 2&quot; soundtrack. He also participated in the drummer sessions of the soundtrack of &quot;Man of Steel&quot; by Hans Zimmer. In March 2013, Robin Thicke&#x27;s single &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;, written and produced by Williams, was released. The song peaked at number one in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. In mid-2013, Williams was involved in two songs that sold a million copies in the UK: &quot;Get Lucky&quot; and &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;.


In August 2013, Busta Rhymes talked about an unreleased &quot;documentary album&quot; by Williams where he talks about &quot;inner-city strife and hardship&quot;. In November 2013, Williams released the first 24-hour music video for &quot;Happy&quot;; guest appearances included Magic Johnson, Steve Carell, Jimmy Kimmel, Odd Future, among others. On November 1, 2013, Williams performed with a gospel choir at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine black parishioners were shot and killed on June 17, 2015.

It was announced in December 2013 that Williams had been nominated for seven Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year. In the same month, Williams signed a contract with Columbia Records, and announced an album set for release in 2014 that would feature &quot;Happy&quot;. For &quot;Happy&quot;, Williams was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In February 2014, Major Lazer announced they would be releasing a five-track EP titled &quot;Apocalypse Soon&quot; on the 25th of that month. The EP, released via Mad Decent and Secretly Canadian, features Williams and Sean Paul, among others. The first single off the EP, which features Williams, is titled &quot;Aerosol Can&quot;. Williams contributed a verse to Future&#x27;s February 2014 single &quot;Move That Dope&quot;, which also featured Pusha T and Casino over production from Mike Will Made It.

On February 18, 2014, Williams announced via Twitter that his second album, &quot;Girl&quot;, would be released on March 3, 2014. The album was supported by a European concert tour, Dear Girl Tour. At the 86th Academy Awards on March 2, 2014, Williams&#x27;s song &quot;Happy&quot; lost to &quot;Let It Go&quot; from &quot;Frozen&quot;. Afterwards, when &quot;GQ&quot; magazine asked Williams &quot;how badly&quot; did he want the Oscar, he responded: &quot;When they read the results, my face was...frozen. But then I thought about it, and I just decided just to...let it go&quot;. At the Oscar Awards that same year, he wore a controversial outfit consisting of a tuxedo with shorts. In May 2014, Williams received an Innovator Award at the iHeartRadio Music Awards.

===2014–present: &quot;The Voice&quot;, &quot;Something in the Water&quot; and other ventures===
In March 2014, it was announced that Comme des Garçons would be releasing a unisex fragrance with Williams, named after his album &quot;Girl&quot;. On March 31, 2014, Williams was announced as a new coach for the seventh season of &quot;The Voice&quot;, replacing CeeLo Green. In June 2014, it was announced that Williams would make a guest appearance on the docu-series &quot;Sisterhood of Hip Hop&quot;. Williams co-composed the score for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; (2014) with Hans Zimmer, Johnny Marr, Michael Einziger, and David A. Stewart. Williams was the executive producer of Atlanta rapper T.I.&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Paperwork&quot;, which was released on October 21, 2014, by Grand Hustle and Columbia Records. In May 2014, Williams curated an art show named after his album, &quot;Girl&quot;, at the Galerie Perrotin in Paris, France. The show included artists Takashi Murakami, JR, Daniel Arsham, and Marina Abramović, among others. Williams collaborated with Gwen Stefani with the song &quot;Shine&quot; for the animated film &quot;Paddington&quot; (2014).
In January 2015, Williams was announced as the musical director for a 7-continent Live Earth concert on June 18, 2015, to raise awareness about and pressure governments to act on climate change. On February 8, 2015, Williams made a cameo in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; entitled &quot;Walking Big &amp; Tall&quot; where he comes to Springfield to write a new anthem for the town. Williams recorded three songs for the soundtrack to the 2015 animated film &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot;. On May 18, 2015, Team Pharrell had 16-year-old Sawyer Fredericks win the eighth season of &quot;The Voice&quot;.

At the 2015 Grammy Awards, Williams performed an orchestral rendition of &quot;Happy&quot; with Hans Zimmer and pianist Lang Lang that included a tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement, inspired by Eric Garner&#x27;s death and the Ferguson unrest. In 2015, a unanimous jury determined that &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;, which Williams co-wrote and produced, was an infringement of the 1977 Marvin Gaye song &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot;. The jury awarded the Gaye family $7.4 million in damages for the copyright infringement based on profits generated. In October 2015, the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University named Williams as their artist-in-residence. He gave the 2017 commencement address at the university and received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree on May 17, 2017. In 2018, Williams worked with Ariana Grande for her fourth studio album, &quot;Sweetener&quot; (2018). He produced several songs on the album, and is featured on the song &quot;Blazed&quot;.

In March 2019, Williams and the city of Virginia Beach announced the launch of a three-day music and cultural festival titled &quot;Something in the Water&quot;, to be held during College Beach Weekend, April 26–28, on the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. The festival lineup included Travis Scott, Migos, Janelle Monáe, SZA, Rosalía, Anderson .Paak, Jhené Aiko, Mac DeMarco, Maggie Rogers, Lil Uzi Vert, Missy Elliott, Pusha T, Dave Matthews Band, and DRAM. The first day of the festival was cancelled due to severe storms. The &quot;Pharrell and Friends&quot; set that closed the festival&#x27;s second day, featured Williams and a lineup of guests, including Jay-Z, Diddy, Busta Rhymes, Usher, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Charlie Wilson, and Tyler, the Creator. The festival&#x27;s final day featured Trey Songz, Chris Brown, Lil Duval, and members of SWV and Blackstreet. Williams produced five songs for Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Lion King&quot; (2019), marking his third collaboration with composer Hans Zimmer. In October 2019, Williams stated that he regretted the 2013 song &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;, which received intense backlash for its apparent sexist themes.

Williams&#x27; life and career is the subject of &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;, an animated documentary film released in theaters in October 2024 and created using Lego animation.

A film loosely based on Williams&#x27; life, &quot;Golden&quot; was filmed by Michel Gondry and set for release on May 9, 2025. However, the film was canceled by Universal in February 2025 prior to the film entering post-production due to a disagreement with Williams and other producers. The film is permanently shelved and will not be offered to other studios.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
In the past, Williams has stated that he does not have any direct musical influences, but he has expressed his admiration for several musicians, including Michael Jackson, J Dilla, Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway, Marvin Gaye, Rakim, and Q-Tip. Williams explained that A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s debut album, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; (1990), caused a &quot;turning point&quot; in his life, which &quot;made him see that music was art&quot;.

Williams has also referenced his synesthesia as contributing to his art and his enjoyment of music from a young age.

===Four-count start===
Throughout his career, Williams has been known for his &quot;four-count loops&quot; or &quot;four-count starts&quot; at the start of the beats that he produced, which is considered as a producer signature. Williams revealed in a 2019 interview with &quot;Vulture&quot; that the creation of the four-count loop was unintentional, and the loop was essentially what was left in the song while trying to start a song on the beat instead of using a metronome.

==Fashion and business ventures==
In 2005, Williams partnered with Japanese fashion icon Nigo to create the streetwear brands Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream footwear. In 2008, Williams co-designed a series of eyewear and jewelry for Louis Vuitton. In 2008, Williams founded a non-profit organization called &quot;From One Hand To AnOTHER&quot; (FOHTA). In 2009, Williams unveiled a collaborative sculpture with Takashi Murakami at Art Basel, which spoke to the metaphor of value. In May 2011, it was announced that Williams would serve as creative director of KarmaloopTV alongside founder and CEO Greg Selkoe and former AMC president Katie McEnroe.

In May 2012, Williams launched the social media venture I Am Other. In August 2013, Williams created a line of sunglasses for fashion brand Moncler called &quot;Moncler Lunettes&quot;. In 2014, Williams entered a long-term partnership with Adidas. His Adidas NMD &quot;Human Race&quot; collection was released on July 23, 2016. In February 2014, Williams announced a collaboration between G-Star Raw and his textile company Bionic Yarn called &quot;RAW for the Oceans,&quot; a collection of denim made from recycled plastic that is found in the ocean. The project was presented at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

In 2014, Williams appeared on a cover designed by French artist Grégoire Guillemin of New York-based men fashion magazine Adon, covering the collaboration. Williams released a collection for retail giant Uniqlo in April 2014 entitled &quot;i am OTHER&quot;. It was created with Nigo, creative director of UT, the company&#x27;s T-shirt division. In 2014, Williams worked on art with Emmanuel Perrotin and a French manufacturer, Domeau &amp; Pérès. In June 2014, artist collective Rizzoli published a book by FriendsWithYou, &quot;We Are Friends With You&quot;, that featured contributions from Williams, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Peter Doroshenko. Williams was the executive producer of the 2015 crime comedy-drama film &quot;Dope&quot;.

In 2017, Williams designed a €1,000 sneaker in collaboration with Chanel and Adidas. In November 2018, Williams performed at a Friends of the Israel Defense Forces Gala, which raised a record high of $60 million. He also spoke about the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, stating &quot;what happened in that synagogue was incredibly cruel, it was wrong, and it’s not supposed to be what our nation is... this group of people have been tested over and over and over again … but you guys show an incredible resilience.&quot; Williams was criticized for singing &quot;Happy&quot; on social media, with critics citing the IDF as having killed over 200 Palestinians in 2018, calling the song contrary to the actions of the military.

Verizon partnered with Williams on April 26, 2019, to launch a tech-fused music curriculum in a nationwide Verizon Foundation Learning schools. The education organization under Verizon Foundation works toward providing free technology, internet access, technology-focused curriculum to under-resourced middle schools. In November 2020, Williams launched Humanrace, a skin care brand. In December 2021, Williams would launch the winter line &quot;Premium basics&quot; together with Adidas Originals.

In June 2022, Doodles announced Williams as its Chief Brand Officer. Additionally, Doodles have set a release date for Williams to release a Doodles album that will be available to stream in addition to be sold exclusively as NFTs.

On February 14, 2023, Louis Vuitton announced that Williams had been appointed their new men&#x27;s creative director, a position left vacant by the death of Virgil Abloh in 2021. Williams displayed his first collection during Paris Men&#x27;s Fashion Week in June 2023.

==Personal life==
Williams married his longtime partner, model and fashion designer Helen Lasichanh, on October 12, 2013. The couple have four children together: son Rocket (b. 2008) and triplets (b. January 2017). The &quot;Despicable Me&quot; song &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Theme&quot; was written in honor of their son Rocket.

In 2005, Williams was voted &quot;Best Dressed Man in the World&quot; by &quot;Esquire&quot;. He is a fan of the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as indicated by his consistent use of the Vulcan salute to signify his label name, Star Trak. Williams is a skateboarder and has a half-pipe inside his home. In 2011, Williams announced that he is building a $35 million after-school center in his home town, Virginia Beach. In 2015, Williams bought a house in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles. In 2019, Williams offered internships to 144 students at Promise Academy in Harlem, New York City.

On March 26, 2021, Williams&#x27; cousin Donovan Lynch was shot and killed by an officer from the Virginia Beach Police Department after &quot;brandishing a handgun&quot; following three shootings in the area. Williams has called for a federal investigation into the incident.

<text>Captain William Winde (c.1645–1722) was an English gentleman architect, whose military career under Charles II, resulting in fortifications and topographical surveys but lack of preferment, and his later career, following the Glorious Revolution, as designer or simply &quot;conductor&quot; of the works of country houses, has been epitomised by Howard Colvin, who said that &quot;Winde ranks with Hooke, May, Pratt and Talman as one of the principal English country house architects of the late seventeenth century&quot; (Colvin 1995, p 1066).

Winde was born in Holland to English parents.

==Works==
His work included:

*Hampstead Marshall, (for William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven), where he completed a house begun by Sir Balthazar Gerbier, c. 1662–1688, from the dates on many surviving drawings. Thomas Strong, mason; Edward Pierce, wood-carver; Edward Goudge, plasterer. Destroyed by fire 1718. Gate piers remain.
*Caversham Park, (also for Lord Craven), rebuilding the Elizabethan manor house after 1660. The estate was sold in 1697.
*Coombe Abbey, near Coventry (for the Earl of Craven). Rebuilt centre block and north wing, c. 1682–88. North wing demolished.
*Buckingham House (for John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham), 1702–05. Completely embodied in Buckingham Palace. 
*Powis House, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, London (for First Marquess of Powis) 1682–89. (later Newcastle House).
*Castle Bromwich Hall 1686–1703; the gardens here have been restored according to Winde&#x27;s plans.

Possible attributions include:
*Belton House near Grantham, Lincolnshire
*Cliveden House, Buckinghamshire (for George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham) c.1676-8. Destroyed by fire 1795 and rebuilt.
*Wotton House, Buckinghamshire

Capt. Winde also gave designs for parterre gardens

==Family==
Winde married Magdalene, daughter of Sir James Bridgeman. His correspondence with his cousin Lady Mary Bridgeman of Castle Bromwich Hall, is at the Staffordshire Record Office.

<text>Donald Byron (born November 8, 1958) is an American composer and multi-instrumentalist. He primarily plays clarinet but has also played bass clarinet and saxophone in a variety of genres that includes free jazz and klezmer.

==Biography==
His mother was a pianist. His father worked as a mailman and played bass in calypso bands. Byron listened to Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis while growing up, but he was exposed to other styles through trips to the ballet and symphony orchestra. When he was a child, he had asthma, and a doctor recommended playing an instrument to improve his breathing. This was why he started playing clarinet. He grew up in the South Bronx among many Jewish neighbors who sparked an interest in klezmer. Other influences include Joe Henderson, Artie Shaw, Jimmy Hamilton, and Tony Scott. In his teens he took clarinet lessons from Joe Allard. George Russell was one of his teachers at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. At the school he was a member of Klezmer Conservatory Band led by Hankus Netsky. In the 1980s he moved to New York City where he played with avant-garde jazz musicians such as Hamiet Bluiett, Craig Harris, and David Murray.

Byron is a member of the Black Rock Coalition. In 2001, he performed &quot;Bli Blip&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Indigo&quot;, a tribute to Duke Ellington which raised money for charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. He has recorded with Bill Frisell, Joe Henry, Marc Ribot, Vernon Reid, and Allen Toussaint.

He has worked as a professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver (2015), The University at Albany (2005–2009), and MIT (2007–2008), teaching composition, improvisation, music history, clarinet, and saxophone.

Byron is a practicing jazz historian, and some of his albums have been recreations (in spirit) of forgotten moments in the history of popular music. Examples are &quot;Plays the Music of Mickey Katz&quot; and &quot;Bug Music&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Byron won the Rome Prize Fellowship awarded by the American Academy in Rome in 2009. His Seven Etudes for solo piano, commissioned by pianist Lisa Moore, made him a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Musical Composition in 2009. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo in 2005 for his bass clarinet solo on &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot; from &quot;Ivey-Divey&quot;.

He was a judge for the 2nd annual Independent Music Awards.

Byron was named a 2007 USA Prudential Fellow and awarded a grant by United States Artists, a public charity that supports and promotes the work of American artists. He also won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2007.

<text>62 Erato () is a carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It is a member of the Themis family of asteroids that share similar properties and orbital characteristics. Photometric measurements during 2004–2005 showed a rotation period of with an amplitude of in magnitude. It is orbiting the Sun with a period of , a semimajor axis of , and eccentricity of 0.178. The orbital plane is inclined by an angle of 2.22° to the plane of the ecliptic.

Erato is the first asteroid to have been credited with co-discoverers, Oskar Lesser and Wilhelm Forster, who discovered it on 14 September 1860, from the Berlin Observatory. It was their first and only asteroid discovery. The name was chosen by Johann Franz Encke, director of the observatory, and refers to Erato, the Muse of lyric poetry in Greek mythology. It has also been classified as a member of the Eos family.

<text>Jean (or Jehan) Fouquet (; –1481) was a French painter and miniaturist. A master of panel painting and manuscript illumination, and the apparent inventor of the portrait miniature, he is considered one of the most important painters from the period between the late Gothic and early Renaissance. He was the first French artist to travel to Italy and experience first-hand the early Italian Renaissance.

Little is known of Fouquet&#x27;s early life and education. Though long assumed to have been an apprentice of the so-called Bedford Master of Paris it is now suggested that he may have studied under the Jouvenal Master in Nantes, whose works were formerly assumed to be early works by Fouquet. Sometime between 1445 and 1447 he travelled to Italy, where he came under the influence of Roman Quattrocento artists such as Fra Angelico and Filarete. During the 1450s he began working at the French court, where he counted kings Charles VII and his successor Louis XI among his many patrons.

Fouquet was born in Tours. Little is known of his life, but it is certain that he was in Italy before 1447, when he executed a portrait of Pope Eugene IV, who died that year. The portrait survives only in copies from much later.

Upon his return to France, while retaining his purely French sentiment, he grafted the elements of the Tuscan style, which he had acquired during his period in Italy, upon the style of the Van Eycks, forming the basis of early 15th-century French art and becoming the founder of an important new school.

He worked for the French court, including Charles VII, the treasurer Étienne Chevalier, and the chancellor Guillaume Jouvenel des Ursins. Near the end of his career, he became court painter to Louis XI.

His work can be associated with the French court&#x27;s attempt to solidify French national identity in the wake of its long struggle with England in the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

One example is when Fouquet depicts Charles VII as one of the three magi. This is one of the very few portraits of the king. According to some sources, the other two magi are the Dauphin Louis, future Louis XI, and his brother.

==Works==

Fouquet&#x27;s excellence as an illuminator, his precision in the rendering of the finest detail, and his power of clear characterization in work on this minute scale secured his eminent position in French art. His importance as a painter was demonstrated when his portraits and altarpieces were for the first time brought together from various parts of Europe for the exhibition of the &quot;French Primitives&quot; held at the in Paris.

His self-portrait miniature would be the earliest sole self-portrait surviving in Western art, if the 1433 portrait by Jan van Eyck—usually called &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; or &quot;Portrait of a Man in a Turban&quot;—is not in fact a self-portrait, as some art historians believe.
Far more numerous are his illuminated books and miniatures. The in Chantilly contains forty of the forty-seven remaining miniatures from the Hours of Étienne Chevalier, painted in 1461 for Chevalier. Fouquet also illuminated a copy of the &quot;Grandes Chroniques de France&quot;, for an unknown patron, thought to be either Charles VII or someone else at the royal court.

Also from Fouquet&#x27;s hand are a few miniatures from five other books and eleven of the fourteen miniatures illustrating the Antiquities of the Jews by Flavius Josephus at the Bibliothèque Nationale. The second volume of this manuscript, with only one of the original thirteen miniatures, was discovered and bought in 1903 by Henry Yates Thompson at a London sale, and restored by him to France.

Only three drawings are attributed to Fouquet:

One of Fouquet&#x27;s most important paintings is the &quot;Melun Diptych&quot; (), formerly in the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame, Melun. The left wing of the diptych depicts Étienne Chevalier with his patron saint St. Stephen and is now in the . The right wing shows a pale Virgin and Child surrounded by red and blue angels and is now at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp. Since at least the seventeenth century, the Virgin has been recognized as a portrait of Agnès Sorel.

Besides his self-portrait miniature, the Louvre has his oil portraits of Charles VII and Guillaume Jouvenel des Ursins and six illuminated manuscript miniatures from the Hours of Étienne Chevalier, the &quot;Histoire ancienne jusqu&#x27;à César&quot; and the &quot;Faits des Romains&quot;.

<text>Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens are situated adjacent to the west side of Castle Bromwich Hall, a Jacobean Mansion. They are in the old centre of Castle Bromwich, a large village in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull of the English West Midlands area.

==History==
Castle Bromwich Hall was built between 1557 and 1585 by Sir Edward Devereux, the first MP for Tamworth. Sir Orlando Bridgeman bought the Hall and Gardens in 1657 for his son, Sir John Bridgeman I. He made changes to both around the year 1700 advised by his cousin, Captain William Winde. The gardens were designed as a formal arrangement of self-contained garden areas. Some of these were ornamental and some working. They were separated by walls, hedges or level-changes at terraces. On the death of Sir John Bridgeman I in 1710 his son, Sir John Bridgeman II, continued to extend the Gardens westwards until they reached their present size of . He also improved the Hall.

The Gardens were developed by further generations of the family, later to become the Earls of Bradford. Lady Ida Bridgeman was the last member of the family to live at the Hall before her death in 1936 and the Gardens were well looked after again under her care. The Hall was then rented out and they fell into decline. A planning application was made in 1982 for the building of housing. Luckily, the planning inspectors employed by West Midlands County Council realized the importance of the Gardens and resisted development. The housing proposal went to appeal and was refused. It was decided that restoration was essential and work started to clear the undergrowth and repair the damage caused by vandals. The &quot;Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens Trust&quot; was formed to restore and maintain them. In 1986 the Gardens and adjoining Parkland was listed as Grade II*.

==Features==

These walled Baroque gardens are listed grade II* and are the only remaining example in the country of a formal English garden design. They are being restored as near as possible to the period 1680–1740, which was when they were at their best, and contain over 600 species of plants from the time. 

The Holly Maze is a mirror image of the one at Hampton Court Palace designed by George London and Henry Wise. The Kitchen and Fruit garden is based on a design by Batty Langley from his book &quot;New Principles of Gardening&quot;. 

The Hall and other buildings are privately owned. Castle Bromwich Hall itself is now a hotel. All buildings and the gardens closest to the house can be seen from the Gardens or roads.

A DVD of the gardens by Great Britain Online is available.

<doc id="735039" wikidata="Q7300731" url="?curid=735039" title="Reagan's coattails">
<text>Reagan&#x27;s coattails refers to the influence of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s popularity in elections other than his own, after the American political expression to &quot;ride in on another&#x27;s coattails&quot;. Chiefly, it refers to the &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot; accompanying his 1980 election to the U.S. presidency. This victory was accompanied by the change of twelve seats in the United States Senate from Democratic to Republican hands, producing a Republican majority in the Senate for the first time since 1954.

Possibly best known was the defeat of Democratic South Dakota Senator George McGovern, a prominent progressive Democrat who had been the party&#x27;s nominee for president in 1972. McGovern lost his bid for a fourth term by a resounding 19-point margin to Republican Representative James Abdnor.

==1980 Senate Democratic losses==
The Democratic losses in the Senate in 1980 were:
#Alabama: Donald W. Stewart (first elected in 1978) lost in the Democratic primary to Jim Folsom, Jr. Folsom lost the general election to Jeremiah Denton.
#Alaska: Mike Gravel (first elected in 1968) lost in the Democratic primary to Clark Gruening. Gruening lost the general election to Frank Murkowski.
#Florida: Richard B. Stone (first elected in 1974) lost in the Democratic primary to Bill Gunter. Gunter lost the general election to Paula Hawkins.
#Georgia: Herman Talmadge (first elected in 1956) lost to Mack Mattingly.
#Idaho: Frank Church (first elected in 1956) lost to Steve Symms.
#Indiana: Birch Bayh (first elected in 1962) lost to Dan Quayle.
#Iowa: John Culver (first elected in 1974) lost to Chuck Grassley.
#New Hampshire: John A. Durkin (first elected in 1975) lost to Warren Rudman. Durkin resigned his seat in December and Rudman was appointed to fill out the remaining few days of Durkin&#x27;s term.
#North Carolina: Robert Burren Morgan (first elected in 1974) lost to John P. East.
#South Dakota: George McGovern (first elected in 1962) lost to James Abdnor. 
#Washington: Warren Magnuson (first elected in 1944) lost to Slade Gorton.
#Wisconsin: Gaylord Nelson (first elected in 1962) lost to Bob Kasten.

==1986 and beyond==
Notably, the bulk of the 1980 class of Senate Republicans failed to hold their seats for the Republican party beyond one term. In the 1986 elections, the Democrats managed to recapture the majority in the Senate, largely thanks to the defeat of several members of the Reagan class of 1980:

*In South Dakota, Abdnor was challenged in the Republican primary by Governor Bill Janklow. He survived the tough primary fight, but lost in the general election to Democrat Tom Daschle, who became Democratic Senate leader and held on to the seat until 2004, when he was unseated by Republican John Thune.
*In Washington, Gorton was unseated by Democrat Brock Adams. Gorton later won Washington&#x27;s other Senate seat in 1988 and 1994 before losing re-election again in 2000.
*In Wisconsin, Kasten was reelected in 1986, but was defeated in 1992 by Democrat Russ Feingold. Feingold himself was defeated in 2010 by conservative businessman Ron Johnson.
*In Florida, Hawkins lost her bid for reelection to Democrat Bob Graham, who held the seat until his retirement in 2004, when Republican Mel Martinez was elected to replace him.
*In Alabama, Denton lost his reelection bid to Democrat Richard C. Shelby. However, after the Republicans retook the Senate in 1994, Shelby switched parties, returning the seat to Republican hands.

Democrats won three more seats in 1986, but these have since shown instability, alternating between the parties and in one case between senators:

*In Georgia, Mattingly lost to Democrat Wyche Fowler in 1986. Fowler then lost to Republican Paul Coverdell in 1992 and Coverdell won reelection in 1998. Upon Coverdell&#x27;s death in 2000, Democrat Zell Miller was appointed to the seat and won a special election that year to finish the rest of the term. Miller did not seek reelection in 2004, and was succeeded by Republican Johnny Isakson. Isakson resign in 2019 and was replaced by Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler lost the election to finish Isakson&#x27;s term to Democrat Raphael Warnock.
*In North Carolina, after East committed suicide in 1986, fellow Republican Jim Broyhill was appointed to fill out his term. This seat switched partisan hands in three consecutive elections. Broyhill was defeated by Democrat Terry Sanford in 1986, Sanford was unseated by Republican Lauch Faircloth in 1992, Democrat John Edwards defeated Faircloth in 1998, and Republican Richard Burr won it in 2004 after Edwards retired to become the Democratic nominee for Vice President.
*In Indiana, Quayle won reelection in 1986, and after he resigned to become Vice President in 1988, fellow Republican Dan Coats was appointed to replace him. Coats won a special election in 1990 to fill the rest of Quayle&#x27;s term, and then won a full term in 1992. In 1998, Coats declined to run for a second full term and Democrat Evan Bayh (the son of Birch Bayh, whom Quayle had unseated in 1980) was elected to fill the seat. However, in 2010 Bayh also retired after two terms and was succeeded by Coats. In 2016, Coats did not seek reelection, and Bayh ran for his old seat, but lost the general election to Republican Todd Young.

One other freshmen Republican Senator, Mark Andrews of North Dakota, lost reelection in 1986, to Kent Conrad, but he had succeeded a retiring Republican, Milton Young.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan referred to the Republican majority in 2016&#x27;s Senate and House elections as being &quot;saved&quot; by then-President-elect Donald Trump&#x27;s coattails.

==Other races==

Reagan&#x27;s coattails also affected other elections in 1980, including gubernatorial ones, most prominently the defeat of first term Governor of Arkansas and future President of the United States Bill Clinton by Frank D. White. Nevertheless, Clinton regained the Governorship in a 1982 rematch and held until his election to the Presidency in 1992. In a speech delivered at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Clinton referenced the effect of Reagan as the reason for his defeat in 1980. Other Democratic governors who lost were Joseph P. Teasdale of Missouri, who lost to former governor Kit Bond in a rematch of the 1976 election, and Arthur A. Link of North Dakota, who lost to Allen I. Olson, who only served one term before losing reelection to George A. Sinner. Another Democratic governor, Dixy Lee Ray of Washington, lost renomination to Jim McDermott, who lost the general election to John Spellman, who served one term until he lost reelection to Booth Gardner.

<text>Dieter Althaus (born 29 June 1958 in Heiligenstadt/Eichsfeld) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He served as the 3rd Minister President of Thuringia from 2003 to 2009. In 2003/04 he was the 58th President of the Bundesrat.

==Early career==
Althaus was a teacher for Physics and Mathematics at the Polytechnic Secondary School in Geismar, Thuringia, from 1983 to 1989, where he became deputy headteacher in 1987.

==Political career==
Since 1985 Althaus has been a member of the CDU, remaining with the party as it transformed itself from a loyal supporter of the GDR&#x27;s ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) to a loyal supporter of the West German party of the same name with which it merged in 1990 shortly after German reunification. In 2000 he became chairman of the CDU in Thuringia. Since 1990 he has been a member of the Thuringian Landtag.

In 1992 he became a member of Bernhard Vogel&#x27;s cabinet as State Minister of Cultural Affairs and Education.

On 5 June 2003 Althaus was elected Minister President of Thuringia; he succeeded Bernhard Vogel, who had resigned for reasons of age. As Minister-President he served as President of the Bundesrat in 2003/04. Althaus was also part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the SPD on a coalition agreement following the 2005 federal elections, which paved the way to the formation of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first government.

After the Thuringia elections of 2009, where the CDU went from having an absolute majority to not even having enough seats to form a majority coalition with the FDP, Althaus resigned as Minister-President and as chairman of the CDU in Thuringia.

==Later career==
Since 2010, Althaus has been working for Magna International.

Althaus was nominated by his party as delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2022.

==Political views==
In 2006 Althaus spoke out in favour of a universal basic income.

==Other activities==
===Corporate boards===
* VR-Bank Bad Salzungen Schmalkalden, Member of the Supervisory Board (–2023)
===Non-profit organizations===
* Central Committee of German Catholics, Member
* &quot;Gegen Vergessen – Für Demokratie&quot;, Member of the Board

==Personal life==
=== 2009 skiing accident ===
Althaus caused a skiing collision in Styria, Austria on 1 January 2009 in which he suffered severe injuries. Althaus was skiing down an expert run, but wandered onto an easy slope, where he was skiing in the wrong direction, whereupon he and a 41-year-old Slovak woman collided. The woman subsequently died from her injuries. Althaus was wearing a skiing helmet, while the woman was not. Althaus was fined €33,300 for negligent homicide.

<text>63 Ausonia is a stony Vestian asteroid from the inner region of the asteroid belt, approximately 100 kilometers (60 miles) in diameter. It was discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on 10 February 1861, from the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte, in Naples, Italy. The initial choice of name for the asteroid was &quot;Italia&quot;, after Italy, but this was modified to Ausonia, an ancient classical name for the Italian region.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Ausonia&quot; is a member of the Vesta family. Vestian asteroids have a composition akin to cumulate eucrites (HED meteorites) and are thought to have originated deep within 4 Vesta&#x27;s crust, possibly from the Rheasilvia crater, a large impact crater on its southern hemisphere near the South pole, formed as a result of a subcatastrophic collision. Vesta is the main belt&#x27;s second-largest and second-most-massive body after Ceres.

It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.1–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,354 days; semi-major axis of 2.40 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the Tholen classification, &quot;Ausonia&quot; is a stony S-type asteroid, while in the SMASS classification, it is an Sa-subtype, that transitions from the S-type to the uncommon A-type asteroid. The body&#x27;s stony composition has also been confirmed by polarimetric observations in 2017. Based on its lightcurve, a small moon had been suggested but never confirmed.

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Ausonia&quot; measures between 87.47 and 116.044 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.125 and 0.25. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives an albedo of 0.2082 and a diameter of 90 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 7.55.

&quot;Ausonia&quot; was in a study using the Hubble FGS. Other studied asteroids included 15 Eunomia, 43 Ariadne, 44 Nysa, and 624 Hektor. In 1976, &quot;Ausonia&quot; was the subject of a photometric study by the Observatory of Turin in Italy. A lightcurve of &quot;Ausonia&quot; was obtained with the ESO 0.5-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory in 1980.

<doc id="735065" wikidata="Q434177" url="?curid=735065" title="Andrej Bajuk">
<text>Andrej Bajuk, also known in Spanish as Andrés Bajuk (18 October 1943 – 16 August 2011) was a Slovene politician and economist. He served briefly as Prime Minister of Slovenia in the year 2000, and was Minister of Finance in the centre-right government of Janez Janša between 2004 and 2008. He was the founder and first president of the Christian Democratic party called New Slovenia.

== Life in exile ==
Bajuk was born in a Slovene intellectual family in Nazi-occupied Ljubljana. His father Bozidar Bajuk was a classical philologist, and his grandfather Marko Bajuk was the principal of the Bežigrad Grammar School, one of the most prestigious secondary schools in Ljubljana. The Bajuks were acquainted with the famous poet Edvard Kocbek who lived in the same building.

The family left Slovenia in early May 1945, when the Communists took power in Yugoslavia. They spent nearly three years in refugee camps in Lower and Upper Austria before leaving to Argentina with the help of the Slovene refugee relief network set by Ivan Ahčin and Miha Krek. They settled in Mendoza, where Bajuk grew up, studied and started a family.

He received his first degree in economics at Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. He received his first master&#x27;s degree in a two-year international study program organised by the University of Chicago, receiving the second jointly with his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. He returned to Mendoza, where he taught as a professor at the university. After the military coup in 1976 he was fired and soon left for Washington, D.C., working for the World Bank for a year. He then switched to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), where he stayed for a number of years. He held a range of positions at the IDB, from economist in charge of analysing social projects to adviser to the executive vice-president. For his last six years in Washington he was in charge of the office of the Presidency of the bank and a member of the board of executive directors of the bank. From September 1994 he was IDB representative for Europe in Paris.

== Return to Slovenia ==

From the second half of 1999, Bajuk spent a considerable amount of time in Slovenia. Following the coalition agreement between the Slovenian Christian Democrats and the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia, he assumed leadership of the expert council developing the coalition&#x27;s alternative government programme. At the unification congress of the SKD and Slovene People&#x27;s Party, he was elected deputy president of the unified party.

After the fall of Janez Drnovšek&#x27;s centre-left government, Andrej Bajuk became the prime minister on 3 May 2000, and led the government until 16 November 2000. In July 2000, the newly merged SLS+SKD – Slovenian People&#x27;s Party – contrary to previously agreed policy and government stance – voted in favour of an electoral system based on proportional representation. This led Prime Minister Bajuk to leave the Slovene People&#x27;s Party. In August 2000, he and his supporters founded a new political party called New Slovenia (&quot;Nova Slovenija&quot;, N.Si).

In the elections of 2000, he was elected to the National Assembly, but Janez Drnovšek returned to power as prime minister. Bajuk’s party stayed in the opposition and formed a shadow cabinet jointly with Janez Janša&#x27;s Social Democratic Party of Slovenia.

In the 2004 national elections, he was again elected to the Slovenian parliament. He did not stay an MP for long, as he soon took on the role of the Minister of Finance in the newly elected government, led by Janez Janša. For his actions and work during his time in office, he was declared (the) &quot;finance minister of the year in Europe&quot; by the Financial Times Business magazine, &quot;The Banker&quot; in 2005.

In the parliamentary elections of 2008, the &quot;New Slovenia&quot; party suffered a severe defeat and did not secure the entry in the Slovenian National Assembly. Bajuk resigned as president of the party and was replaced by Ljudmila Novak. At that time, he completely retired from public life.

He was fluent in Slovene, Spanish, English and French. Bajuk was the father-in-law of the Slovenian diplomat and essayist Igor Senčar.

Bajuk died of a stroke on 16 August 2011.

<text>64 Angelina is an asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 50 kilometers in diameter. It is an unusually bright form of E-type asteroid.

== Discovery and naming ==

Angelina was discovered on March 4, 1861, by a prolific comet discoverer, E. W. Tempel, observing from Marseilles, France. It was the first of his five asteroid discoveries.

The naming of Angelina caused some controversy. It was chosen by Benjamin Valz, director of the Marseilles Observatory, in honour of the astronomical station of that name operated by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach on the mountains above the city. At the time, asteroids were supposed to receive names from classical mythology, and several astronomers protested the choice. Tempel noted that if the second &#x27;n&#x27; were removed, the complaints would be satisfied (referring to Angelia, a minor Greek deity). However, Valz&#x27;s choice stayed.

== Physical characteristics ==

Angelina is an uncommon form of E-type asteroid; it is the third largest E-type after 44 Nysa and 55 Pandora, and has an exceptionally high albedo. As of 1991, it is thought to have an average radius of about . Back when asteroids were generally assumed to have low albedos, Angelina was thought to be the largest of this class, but modern research has shown that its diameter is only a quarter of what was previously assumed, an error caused by its exceptional brightness. Traditional calculations had suggested that since Angelina has an absolute magnitude of 7.7 and an albedo of 0.15, its diameter would have been around 100 km. However, a 2004 occultation showed a cross-sectional profile of only 48x53 km. Angelina was observed by Arecibo radar in January 2010.

<text>The Government of Croatia (), formally the Government of the Republic of Croatia (), commonly abbreviated to Croatian Government (), is the main executive branch of government in Croatia. It is led by the president of the Government (), informally abbreviated to premier () or prime minister. The prime minister is nominated by the president of the Republic from among those candidates who enjoy majority support in the Croatian Parliament (); the candidate is then chosen by the Parliament. There are 20 other government members, serving as deputy prime ministers, government ministers or both; they are chosen by the prime minister and confirmed by the Parliament. The Government of the Republic of Croatia exercises its executive powers in conformity with the Croatian Constitution and legislation enacted by the Croatian Parliament. The current government is led by Prime Minister Andrej Plenković.

Following the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868, the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and the Government of the Land or officially the Royal Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Government of the Land ( or )—headed by a crown-appointed ban—were established. This government existed until the Austria-Hungary breakup and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&#x27; creation in 1918. In 1939, the Banovina of Croatia was established and a head of the Banovina of Croatia (Ban) was appointed by the crown, but no effective government was formed before World War II. In 1943, the ZAVNOH established an executive board to act as a new government. The Socialist Republic of Croatia, as a part of federal Yugoslavia, had a separate government (from 1953 to 1990 known as the Executive Council, appointed by the Sabor) with limited powers (excluding defence and foreign relations; this was similar to all the previous governmental forms). Following the first multi-party elections and the adoption of the present Constitution of Croatia in 1990, the present governmental form was adopted and Stjepan Mesić became the first person to lead a non-communist government (under Government of Yugoslavia), while Josip Manolić was the first prime minister of an independent Croatia. Since the introduction of multi-party democracy, the Republic of Croatia has had fourteen governments headed by twelve different prime ministers. Nine governments have been formed by the Croatian Democratic Union, three by the Social Democratic Party of Croatia, one was headed by a non-partisan prime minister and one was a national unity government (formed during the Croatian War of Independence&#x27;s peak).

==Terminology==
The term &quot;government&quot; in Croatia (&#x27;) primarily refers to the executive branch, as used by the government itself, the press and colloquially, as that branch of the government (&#x27;) is responsible for day-to-day governance of the nation (&quot;&quot;); this sense is intended when it is said that a political party forms the government.

== Structure and powers ==

The government, the main executive power of the Croatian state, is headed by the prime minister (PM). The PM currently has four deputies (elected by the Croatian Parliament), who also serve as government ministers; there are 16 other ministers, who are appointed by the prime minister with the approval of the Sabor (by absolute majority vote). The government ministers are each in charge of a particular sector of activity such as Foreign Affairs. The prime minister and all the deputies form an inner cabinet, tasked with coordinating and supervising the work of government ministers on behalf of the PM; the inner cabinet also prepares materials for meetings of the full government cabinet (consisting of the inner cabinet and the remaining 16 ministers). The first deputy prime minister also discharges the duties of the prime minister when the latter is incapacitated or absent. State secretaries () are the highest officials below each minister. There are one or more State secretaries in the ministries. Each State secretary is appointed by the government for the term of the minister, and is responsible to the minister. They act as deputy ministers and attend meetings only exceptionally. State secretaries are also heads of the Central State Offices (see below).

The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws and guiding the foreign and internal policies of the republic. The government&#x27;s official residence is at the Banski dvori in Zagreb. Although the cabinet normally meets at the Banski dvori, occasionally its meetings are held elsewhere in the country.

The Government of the Republic of Croatia exercises its executive powers in conformity with the Croatian Constitution and legislation enacted by the Croatian Parliament, the Sabor (). Its structure, operational procedures and decision-making processes are defined by the Government of the Republic of Croatia Act (2011 with 2014 and 2016 amendments) and the Government Rules of Procedure (2015 with 2015 amendments). The Constitution mandates that the government proposes legislation and other documents to the parliament, proposes the budget and gives financial reports, implements Acts and other decisions of the parliament, enacts any regulations required to implement the Acts, defines foreign and internal policies, directs and oversees the operation of state administration, promotes the economic development of the country, directs the activities and development of public services and performs other activities conforming to the provisions of the Constitution and applicable legislation. The government also passes regulations and administrative acts and orders appointments and removals of appointed officials and civil servants within the scope of its powers. It makes rulings in cases of conflicts of jurisdiction between governmental institutions, responds to questions asked parliamentary majority and opposition representatives, prepares proposals of new legislation and other regulations, gives opinions on legislation and other regulations and adopts strategies for the economic and social development of the country.
The government manages state property of the Republic of Croatia unless special legislation provides otherwise. It may appoint special committees to manage the property on its behalf; this process is implemented through appointed members of supervisory boards and managing boards of companies partially or wholly owned by the Republic of Croatia. The government also determines these appointees&#x27; salaries. It maintains specialized bodies, agencies and offices—including the Legislation Office, the Office for Human Rights and the Rights of National Minorities and Public Relations Service—that are required by the Government Act of 2011, as well as committees to decide administrative matters. Various branches of government may establish joint services. There are further entities established by the government as companies designed to support the aims of the Government, such as the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development that strives to fund the reconstruction and development of the economy of Croatia.

Local (city/municipality) and regional (county)
governments are separate from the central government; the latter maintains a State Administration Office in each county, under the Ministry of Public Administration.

This is a responsible government to the Croatian Parliament, which may recall it as a whole or in part by an absolute majority vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth of the parliament members or by the prime minister. The prime minister and other members are jointly responsible for decisions passed by their government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker of the parliament to signify this. The prime minister appoints members approved by the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker of the parliament). The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the government must be published in &quot;Narodne novine&quot;—the official gazette of Croatia—to bind.

=== Offices and agencies ===


===Operations===
Government meetings are typically public. It may close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.

The inner or core cabinet (the prime minister and the PM&#x27;s deputies) monitors and discusses the operation of the government, and may hold preliminary discussions on any matter performed by the government. The core cabinet may act as the government in emergencies when the government is unable to meet. Its decisions must be verified at the next government session to remain in force. The Government Secretary coordinates agencies, offices and other services subordinated to the government.

==Current cabinet==
==History==
Short-lived Croatian Royal Council (1767–79), appointed by queen Maria Theresa, was a central authority administering economic, political and military matters in Kingdom of Croatia. Ban&#x27;s Council () of 1848–1850 was the first executive council established in Croatia. It acted as an administrative body governing Croatia (and Slavonia) within the Austrian Empire as a government, later to be replaced by the Ban&#x27;s Government (1850–1854), Royal Lieutenancy for Croatia and Slavonia (1854–1861), and Royal Lieutenancy Council (1861–1868) in Zagreb (with Royal Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Chancellery in Vienna, 1862–1868).

Following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the subsequent Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868, the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia was established, along with the Government of the Land, officially the Royal Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Government of the Land ( or &quot;Kraljevska hrvatsko-slavonsko-dalmatinska zemaljska vlada&quot;) headed by a crown-appointed ban. The establishment was carried out during the administration of Ban Levin Rauch. This government form continued until the breakup of Austria-Hungary and creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918. In total, 15 Bans acted as heads of the government in this period. The Royal Croatian-Slavonian-Dalmatian Government was not a parliamentary government, as its cabinet ministers and its head (Ban) were not appointed or confirmed by the Croatian Parliament (&quot;Sabor&quot;), but by Hungarian-Croatian government in Budapest.

In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Cvetković–Maček Agreement was made in 1939; it established the Banovina of Croatia and Ivan Šubašić was appointed as ban to head the Croatian government (Ban&#x27;s Government, ). Still, an effective government was not formed before the onset of World War II.
In June 1943, the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People&#x27;s Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH) established an 11-member executive board to act as the new government of Croatia. The first People&#x27;s Government of the Federal State of Croatia (led by Vladimir Bakarić) was founded at the extraordinary session of the Presidency of the National Anti-Fascist Council of the People&#x27;s Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH), which was held on April 14, 1945, in Split.

People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia, from 1963 Socialist Republic of Croatia, a part of Yugoslavia, maintained its own government (of limited powers, excluding defence and foreign relations). The government was appointed by and responsible to the Sabor. During the Communist era, there were 14 governments of Croatia. From 1953 to 1990 the official name of the government was the Executive Council of the Sabor ().

Following the parliamentary elections and the adoption of the present Constitution of Croatia in 1990, the present form of government was begun. On 30 May 1990, Stjepan Mesić became the first person to hold the title of Prime Minister of Croatia, and Franjo Gregurić was the first prime minister of an independent Croatia, as he held the office on 8 October 1991 when the declaration of independence came into effect.

===List===

Since 30 May 1990 (the first multi-party parliamentary election held following the 45-year Communist rule), the Republic of Croatia has had a total of fourteen governments headed by twelve different prime ministers. The prime minister in the first government after the first multi-party election was Stjepan Mesić, who would later go on to become the President of Croatia. That government was formed by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), as were seven other governments of Croatia. Three governments have been formed by the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), and one was a national unity government (representing a wide coalition of political parties) formed during the Croatian War of Independence&#x27;s peak, between July 1991 and August 1992, with Franjo Gregurić as the prime minister.
