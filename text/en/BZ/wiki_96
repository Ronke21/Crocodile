<text>Children of Paradise (, ) is a two-part French romantic drama film by Marcel Carné, produced under war conditions in 1943, 1944, and early 1945 in both Vichy France and Occupied France. Set in the theatrical world of 1830s Paris, it tells the story of a courtesan and four men—a mime, an actor, a criminal and an aristocrat—who love her in entirely different ways.

It has received universal critical acclaim. &quot;I would give up all my films to have directed &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot;&quot;, said &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; director François Truffaut. In Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;The Duke in His Domain&quot; (1957), actor Marlon Brando called it &quot;maybe the best movie ever made&quot;. Its original American trailer positioned it as the French answer to &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (1939), an opinion shared by critic David Shipman. A 1995 vote by 600 French critics and professionals named it the &quot;Best Film Ever&quot;.

==Title==
As noted by one critic, &quot;in French, &quot; is also the colloquial name for the gallery or second balcony in a theatre, where common people sat and viewed a play, responding to it honestly and boisterously. The actors played to these gallery gods, hoping to win their favour, the actor himself thus being elevated to an Olympian status.&quot; The film contains many shots of the audience hanging over the edge of these balconies (which are similarly known as &quot;the gods&quot; in the British theatre), and screenwriter Jacques Prévert stated that the title &quot;refers to the actors ... and the audiences too, the good-natured, working-class audience.&quot;

==Story==

===Précis===
&quot;Children of Paradise&quot; is set in the theatrical world of Paris during the July Monarchy (1830–1848), centred on the area around the Funambules theatre, situated on the Boulevard du Temple – pejoratively referred to as the &quot;Boulevard du Crime&quot;. The film revolves around a beautiful and charismatic courtesan, Garance (Arletty). Four men – the mime Baptiste Deburau (Jean-Louis Barrault), the actor Frédérick Lemaître (Pierre Brasseur), the thief Pierre François Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand), and the aristocrat Édouard de Montray (Louis Salou) – are in love with Garance, and their intrigues drive the story forward. Garance is briefly intrigued/involved with them all, but leaves them when they attempt to force her to love on their terms, rather than her own. The mime Baptiste is the one who suffers the most in pursuit of the unattainable Garance.

===Sources===
The four men courting Garance are all based on real French personalities of the 1820s and 1830s. Baptiste Deburau was a famous mime and Frédérick Lemaître was an acclaimed actor on the &quot;Boulevard of Crime&quot; depicted in the film. Pierre Lacenaire was an infamous French criminal, and the character of the Comte Édouard de Montray was inspired by the Duc de Morny.

The idea for making a movie based on these characters came from a chance meeting between Carné and Jean-Louis Barrault, in Nice, during which Barrault pitched the idea of making a movie based on Deburau and Lemaître. Carné, who at the time was hesitant about which movie to direct next, proposed this idea to his friend Jacques Prévert. Prévert was initially reluctant to write a movie about a mime, &quot;Jacques hated pantomime&quot; his brother once said, but Barrault assured Prévert, that he and his teacher Étienne Decroux, who plays Baptiste&#x27;s father in the film, would take responsibility for developing the mime sequences. According to Trauner, Prévert then saw an opportunity to include the character of Lacenaire, the &quot;dandy du crime&quot;, who fascinated him. The Germans were then occupying the whole of France, and Prévert is rumoured to have said &quot;They will not let me do a movie about Lacenaire, but I can put Lacenaire in a film about Deburau&quot;. The script incorporates quotations from Lacenaire&#x27;s autobiography.

===Plot summary===
&quot;Children of Paradise&quot; is divided into two parts, &quot;Boulevard du Crime&quot; (&quot;Boulevard of Crime&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;Homme Blanc&quot; (&quot;The Man in White&quot;). The first begins around 1827, the second about seven years later. The action takes place mainly in the neighbourhood of the Boulevard du Temple in Paris, nicknamed &quot;Boulevard of Crime&quot; because of all the melodramas and bloody scenarios offered to the largely plebeian public each evening. There are two principal theatres: the &quot;Théâtre des Funambules&quot; (&quot;Theatre of Tightrope Walkers&quot;) specializes in pantomime, since the authorities do not allow it to use spoken dialogue, which is reserved for the &quot;official&quot; venue, the Grand Theatre.

Part I: Boulevard of Crime
A young actor and womaniser, Frédérick Lemaître, dreams of becoming a star. He meets and flirts with Garance, a beautiful woman who earns her living by modestly exhibiting her physical charms in a carnival show. Garance staves off Frédérick&#x27;s advances and goes to visit one of her acquaintances, Pierre-François Lacenaire, a rebel in revolt against society. Lacenaire is a proud, dangerous individual who works as a scrivener to cover his organized criminal enterprises. Shortly thereafter, Garance is accused of stealing a man&#x27;s gold watch while she is watching a pantomime featuring Baptiste Deburau and a barker (Baptiste&#x27;s father) in front of the Funambules Theatre. Lacenaire is in fact the guilty party. Baptiste, dressed up as the stock character Pierrot, saves her from the police by silently acting out the theft, which he has just witnessed. He reveals a great talent, a veritable vocation for pantomime, but falls immediately and irremediably in love with Garance, saving a flower she thanked him with. In the background, there is a price list for various seats, including &quot;Paradise&quot;, which is visible over the mime&#x27;s shoulder.

Baptiste&#x27;s father is one of the stars at the Funambules. The daughter of the theatre director, Nathalie, who is a mime also, is deeply in love with Baptiste. Before the performance that evening, a used-clothes peddler named Jéricho reads in her palm that she will marry the man she loves, as he knew her father was worried about her mood affecting her performances. When a fight breaks out that evening between two rival clans of actors, Baptiste and Frédérick manage to calm the crowd down by improvising a mime act, thus saving the day&#x27;s receipts. The most enthusiastic of the spectators are those seated in &quot;paradise&quot; (&quot;paradis&quot;), a term denoting in French theatrical language the top floor of the balcony, where the cheapest seats are located.

Later that night, Baptiste catches sight of Garance with Lacenaire and his accomplices in a seedy restaurant/dancehall, &quot;Le Rouge Gorge&quot; (a pun: this means &quot;The Robin&quot; or &quot;The Red Breast&quot;, but literally translates as &quot;The Red Throat&quot;, a reference to the previous owner&#x27;s throat having been slit). When he invites Garance to dance, he is thrown out of the restaurant by Avril, one of Lacenaire&#x27;s thugs. He turns the situation around and leaves with Garance, for whom he finds a room at the same boarding house where he and Frédérick live. After declaring his love, Baptiste flees Garance&#x27;s room when she says she doesn&#x27;t feel the same way, despite her clear invitation to stay. When Frédérick hears Garance singing in her room, which is next to his, he quickly joins her.

Baptiste becomes the star of the Funambules; fuelled by his passion, he writes several very popular pantomimes, performing with Garance and Frédérick, who have become lovers. Baptiste is tormented by their affair, while Nathalie, who is convinced that she and Baptiste are &quot;made for each other&quot;, suffers from his lack of love for her.

Garance is visited in her dressing room by the Count Édouard de Montray, a wealthy and cynical dandy who offers her his fortune if she will agree to become his mistress. Garance is repelled by him and mockingly rejects his proposition. The count nonetheless offers her his protection if the need were to arise. She is later unjustly suspected of complicity in an abortive robbery and murder attempt by Lacenaire and Avril. To avoid arrest she is forced to appeal to Count Édouard for protection. The first part of the film comes to an end with this development.

Part II: The Man in White
Several years later, Frédérick has become famous as the star of the Grand Theatre. A man about town and a spendthrift, he is covered with debts – which doesn&#x27;t prevent him from devastating the mediocre play in which he currently has the main role by exposing it to ridicule in rehearsal and then playing it for laughs, rather than straight melodrama, on opening night. Despite achieving a smashing success, the play&#x27;s three fussy authors are still outraged and challenge him to a duel. He accepts and when he returns to his dressing room, Frédérick is confronted by Lacenaire, who apparently intends to rob and kill him. However, the criminal is an amateur playwright and strikes up a friendship with the actor instead. He and Avril serve as Frédérick&#x27;s seconds the next morning, when the actor arrives at the duel dead drunk.

Baptiste is enjoying even greater success as a mime at the Funambules. When Frédérick goes to a performance the day after surviving the duel, he is surprised to find himself in the same box as Garance. His old flame has returned to Paris after having travelled throughout the world with the Count de Montray, who has kept her these several years. She has been attending the Funambules every night incognito to watch Baptiste perform. She knows she has always been genuinely in love with him. Frédérick suddenly finds himself jealous for the first time in his life. While the feeling is highly unpleasant, he remarks that his jealousy will help him as an actor. He will finally be able to play the role of Othello, having now experienced the emotions which motivate the character. Garance asks Frédérick to tell Baptiste of her presence, but Nathalie, now Baptiste&#x27;s wife, is first informed by the spiteful rag-man Jéricho. She sends their small son to Garance&#x27;s box to mortify her with their family&#x27;s happiness. By the time Frédérick alerts Baptiste and he rushes to find her, the box is empty.

When Garance returns to the Count&#x27;s luxurious mansion, she finds Lacenaire waiting for her. Lacenaire satisfies himself that Garance has no love for him and, on his way out, encounters the Count, who is irritated to see such an individual in his home. Lacenaire reacts to the Count&#x27;s challenge with threats, revealing the knife at his belt. Later, Garance declares to the Count that she will never love him since she is already in love with another man, but declares she will continue to try to please him, and offers to spread the word on the streets that she is &quot;mad&quot; about him, if he would like.

Frédérick has finally achieved his dream of playing the role of Othello. The Count, who insists on attending the performance with Garance, is convinced that the actor is the man she loves. At a break in the play, the Count coolly mocks Frédérick, trying to provoke him into a duel. Elsewhere Baptiste, who is also in the audience, encounters Garance at last. When Lacenaire takes Frédérick&#x27;s side in the verbal jousting, the Count attempts to humiliate him as well. Lacenaire takes revenge by calling him a cuckold and, dramatically pulling back a curtain, reveals Garance in Baptiste&#x27;s embrace on the balcony. The two lovers slip away to spend the night together in Garance&#x27;s former room at the Great Post House.

The next morning, at a hammam, Lacenaire assassinates the Count. He then calmly sits to wait for the police and meet his &quot;destiny&quot;, which is to die on the scaffold. At the rooming house, Nathalie walks in on Baptiste and Garance. Garance is in a hurry to exit in order to prevent the duel between Frédérick and the Count, who she is unaware has been murdered, but Nathalie blocks her way, insisting that leaving is easy, while to stay and share someone&#x27;s everyday life, as she has for the past six years with Baptiste, is much more difficult. Garance responds that she has lived with Baptiste for six years as well, that she felt him every day and night even though she was with another. Nathalie dismisses Garance&#x27;s experience as unimportant and moves past her to Baptiste, allowing Garance to leave. Nathalie pleads with Baptiste for reassurance as he attempts to follow Garance. Baptiste pushes past her and is soon lost in the frantic Carnival crowd amid a sea of bobbing masks and unheeding, white Pierrots. The film ends as a desperate Baptiste is swept away with the crowd and Garance leaves in her carriage, her face impassive. The crowd that brought Garance and Baptiste together in the opening scene pulls them apart.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was made under extremely difficult conditions. External sets in Nice were badly damaged by natural causes, exacerbated and compounded by the theatrical constraints during the German occupation of France during World War II. The film was split into two parts because the distributor, Gaumont, could only screen a three hour film half as many times as usual. By making the film a pseudo double feature, the distributor could charge eighty-francs per admission, double the usual amount, therefore making up the shortfall. Barrault was committed to the premiere production of &quot;The Satin Slipper&quot; (&quot;Le Soulier de satin&quot;), which was a hit, and almost offered his role to a music hall entertainer, Jacques Tati, then little known, before a schedule was negotiated which allowed him to fulfil both roles.

Film critic Pauline Kael wrote that, allegedly, &quot;the starving extras made away with some of the banquets before they could be photographed&quot;. Many of the 1,800 extras were Resistance agents using the film as daytime cover, who, until the liberation, had to mingle with some collaborators or Vichy sympathisers who were imposed on the production by the authorities. Alexandre Trauner, who designed the sets, and Joseph Kosma, who composed the music, were Jewish and had to work in secrecy throughout the production. Music was provided by the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire under the direction of renowned conductor, Charles Münch, who personally contributed part of his income to the French Resistance. Trauner lived (under an assumed name) with Carné and Prévert during the six months it took them to prepare the script. Maurice Thiriet, Kosma&#x27;s orchestrator, acted as his front.

The set builders were short of supplies and the camera crew&#x27;s film stock was rationed. The financing, originally a French-Italian production, collapsed a few weeks after production began in Nice, due to the Allied conquest of Sicily in August 1943. Around this time, the Nazis forbade the producer, André Paulvé, from working on the film because of his remote Jewish ancestry, and the production had to be suspended for three months. The French film company Pathé took over production, whose cost was escalating wildly. The quarter-mile long main set, the &quot;Boulevard du Temple&quot;, was severely damaged by a storm and had to be rebuilt. By the time shooting resumed in Paris in early spring of 1944, the director of photography, Roger Hubert, had been assigned to another production and Philippe Agostini, who replaced him, had to analyse all the reels in order to match the lighting of the non-sequential shot list; all the while, electricity in the Paris Studios was intermittent.

The movie also marks the first artistic collaboration between Carné and the French painter and costume designer Mayo, one that would continue over several films (&quot;Les Portes de la Nuit&quot; (1946), &quot;La Fleur de l&#x27;Age&quot; (1947), &quot;Juliette ou la Clef des Songes&quot;, &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; (1953), &quot;Les Tricheurs&quot; (1958)). This friend of Prévert started his work on the project very early on in order to immerse himself fully in the script and the characters. The materials, provided by Jeanne Lanvin, allowed work on the costumes to be done in very favourable conditions given the difficult period of the French occupation.
Production was delayed again after the Allies landed in Normandy, perhaps intentionally stalled so that it would only be completed after the French liberation. When Paris was liberated in August 1944, the actor Robert Le Vigan, cast in the role of informer-thief Jéricho, was sentenced to death by the Resistance for collaborating with the Nazis, and had to flee, along with author Céline, to Sigmaringen. He was replaced at a moment&#x27;s notice by Pierre Renoir, older brother of French filmmaker Jean Renoir and son of the famous painter, and most of the scenes had to be redone. Le Vigan was tried and convicted as a Nazi collaborator in 1946. One scene featuring Le Vigan survives in the middle of the second part, when Jericho snitches to Nathalie. Carné and Prévert had hidden some of the key reels of film from the occupying forces, hoping that the liberation of Paris would have occurred when the film was ready for release.

==Reception==
The film was the third most popular film at the French box-office in 1945. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 98% of 42 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; with an average rating of 9.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Strong performances abound, and Carne&#x27;s wit and grace are evident in this masterful (if long) French epic.&quot; The film critic Roger Ebert added it to his &quot;Great Movie&quot; collection in 2002. &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2005 All-&quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the greatest films made since 1923. Jacques Prévert&#x27;s screenplay was nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay at the 19th Academy Awards. It isn&#x27;t clear which version of the film was honoured; the U.S. release of the film has been described as &quot;a 144-min., inadequately-subtitled one released in New York in 1947.&quot;

==Release versions==
The film had its premiere in Paris, at the Chaillot Palace on 9 March 1945, in its entirety. Carné then had to fight with the producers to have the film shown exclusively in two theatres (Madeleine and Colisée) instead of one and in its entirety and without an intermission. He also pioneered the idea of the public being able to reserve their seats in advance. The producers accepted Carné&#x27;s demands on the condition that they be able to charge double the price of admittance. &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; became an instant and monumental success, remaining on the screen of the Madeleine Theatre for 54 weeks.

===Restoration===
In March 2012, Pathé released a new restoration of the film. This involved scanning the badly damaged original camera negative, and other early sources, using a high-resolution 4K digital process to produce a new master print. This restoration was released on Blu-ray Disc in September 2012.

<text>Dangerous Dave is a 1988 platform game by John Romero. It was developed for the Apple II and MS-DOS as an example game to accompany his article about his GraBASIC, an Applesoft BASIC add-on, for the &quot;UpTime&quot; disk magazine.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to collect gold trophies to move on to the next level. Since the original 1988 publishing of &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot; on UpTime, there have been three sequels and three ports of the original to other platforms.

The idea for &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot; came to John Romero under the influence of &quot;Super Mario&quot;. There are similarities between the two games, such as the secret levels, the level design, the monsters, and the jumping. According to Romero, he was &quot;on purpose trying to make a &quot;Mario&quot; game&quot;. The mission is to guide Dave through ten levels, collecting trophies in the hideout of his enemy, Clyde. Romero says that among all &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot; sequels &quot;Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion&quot; is &quot;the best Dave ever created&quot;.

In 2008, &quot;Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion&quot; was ported to cell phones.

==Post-Romero games==
===&quot;Dangerous Dave&#x27;s Risky Rescue&quot;===
Dangerous Dave&#x27;s Risky Rescue (known informally as Dangerous Dave 3) was published by Softdisk in 1993, and is the first &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot; game to not be programmed by John Romero. This is because he, John Carmack, Adrian Carmack and Tom Hall had left Softdisk by this point to form id Software. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Dave Goes Nutz!&quot;, which shares similar gameplay elements.

Like the previous title, Dangerous Dave is on a mission to save his little brother Delbert, this time from the evil &quot;Dr. Nemesis&quot; (who is also the main antagonist in Softdisk&#x27;s &quot;Catacomb&quot; franchise).

===&quot;Dave Goes Nutz!&quot;===
Dave Goes Nutz! (known informally as Dangerous Dave 4) was published by Softdisk in 1993 for. It continues from &quot;Dangerous Dave&#x27;s Risky Rescue&quot;, where Dangerous Dave is on a mission to save his little brother Delbert, from the evil &quot;Dr. Nemesis&quot; (who is also the main antagonist in Softdisk&#x27;s &quot;Catacomb&quot; franchise). The game takes place within a psychiatric hospital filled with zombies.

==Reception==
&quot;Dangerous Dave&#x27;s Risky Rescue&quot; was reviewed in 1993 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #200 by Sandy Petersen in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Petersen gave the game 2 out of 5 stars.

<doc id="754835" wikidata="Q6967869" url="?curid=754835" title="Nat Perrin">
<text>Nat Perrin (March 15, 1905 – May 9, 1998) was an American comedy film, television, and radio screenwriter, producer, and director, who contributed gags and storylines to several Marx Brothers films and co-wrote the script for the film &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot; (1941) adapted from the stage musical. He is credited with writing the screenplay or story outline for over 25 films, including &quot;The Big Store&quot; (1941), &quot;The Great Morgan&quot; (1945), and &quot;Song of the Thin Man&quot; (1947), as well as several television series.

==Biography==
Perrin was a registered attorney who never practiced; he instead worked in the publicity department for Warner Bros. in 1930. He often told the story of how he made his way into Groucho Marx&#x27;s dressing room in 1931 with a forged letter of introduction from Moss Hart. Groucho was impressed with Perrin, and arranged for him to be hired by Paramount Pictures for the film &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1931). The two went on to become lifelong friends. In the late 1930s, Perrin produced for Columbia Pictures, moving to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1940s. 
In the early 1950s, he became a producer for such TV shows as &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; (run 1951–1971) and the anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (run 1952–1970). He produced and was head writer for &quot;The Addams Family&quot; series from 1964–1966.

Beginning in the late 1970s and well into his later years, Perrin taught screenwriting and film history at California State University Northridge.

His lifelong friendship with Groucho Marx, for whom he also wrote the &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot; radio shows, came to a close when Perrin served as temporary conservator of the comedian&#x27;s estate in 1977.

<doc id="754849" wikidata="Q1052709" url="?curid=754849" title="Larry Tesler">
<text>Lawrence Gordon Tesler (April 24, 1945 – February 16, 2020) was an American computer scientist who worked in the field of human–computer interaction. Tesler worked at Xerox PARC, Apple, Amazon, and Yahoo!.

While at PARC, Tesler&#x27;s work included Smalltalk, the first dynamic object-oriented programming language, and Gypsy, the first word processor with a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Xerox Alto. During this, along with colleague Tim Mott, Tesler developed the idea of copy and paste functionality and the idea of modeless software. While at Apple, Tesler worked on the Apple Lisa and the Apple Newton, and helped to develop Object Pascal and its use in application programming toolkits including MacApp.

== Biography ==

===Early career===
Tesler was born on April 24, 1945, in the Bronx in New York City, to Jewish parents Isidore, an anesthesiologist, and Muriel (). Tesler lived in the Bronx through his childhood and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1961. While in high school, he was guided towards computers by a teacher after showing the teacher an algorithm for generating prime numbers. Through this, he learned of a program at Columbia University where he was able to spend a half-hour each week on their computer systems, through which he taught himself programming before college. He went on to Stanford University in 1961 when he was 16, studying computer science and graduating in 1965 with a degree in mathematics. At Stanford, he had spent time as a student programmer for Joshua Lederberg on the LINC platform, and was a colleague of Larry Breed, Charles Brenner, Douglas Hofstadter, Roger Moore, and Bill Strachan.

During college and afterward, Tesler did some programming jobs on the side, and after graduation, worked as a consultant offering his programming services in the area. As he was one of only a few computer programmers listed in the Palo Alto phone directory he received a good deal of work. However, a regional recession caused this consulting work to dry up. Tesler also worked at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) in the late 1960s. With Horace Enea he designed Compel, an early single assignment language. This functional programming language was intended to make concurrent processing more natural and was used to introduce programming concepts to beginners.

During his time at Stanford, Tesler had participated in the counterculture of the 1960s, including the anti-Vietnam War protests. In the late 1960s, Tesler became involved in the Midpeninsula Free University, part of the Free Speech Movement, where he taught classes with titles such as &quot;How to end the IBM Monopoly&quot;, &quot;Computers Now&quot;, and &quot;Procrastination&quot;.

===Xerox PARC===
Tesler left Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory due to a number of factors in the early 1970s; he recognized that artificial intelligence would not be a usable technology for many years. Tesler is quoted as stating around this time that &quot;AI is whatever hasn&#x27;t been done yet.&quot;, with Douglas Hofstadter calling this Tesler&#x27;s Theorem. Tesler says that he was misquoted, his actual statement being &quot;Intelligence is whatever machines haven&#x27;t done yet.&quot;

At this time, Tesler&#x27;s marriage to his college girlfriend had ended in divorce. He took his daughter and moved to Oregon with a number of Vietnam War veterans who were returning there to build homes. There was little computing technology in this area and he could not get a job with the local bank, the only firm nearby with a computer system. He called Stanford to see if they had anything, and learned that Alan Kay, whom Tesler had worked with while at SAIL and then a member of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), had been actively looking for him shortly after his departure. Kay wanted Tesler to join him at PARC. Tesler could not be hired at PARC due to a hiring freeze, so Tesler instead took a short-term project offered by Les Earnest from SAIL to write a &quot;document compiler&quot;, a means to easily produce printable manuals from simple text files. In order to carry out this project, Tesler wrote Pub, which was then recognized as one of the first uses of markup language; it was later distributed on ARPANet.
PARC approached Tesler with an offer in 1971, but wanted to place Tesler in the On-Line Office System Group. Tesler had been more interested in Xerox&#x27;s work with personal computers, so he turned down the offer. By early 1973, PARC had established development of the Xerox Alto, the first computer system designed around a graphical user interface (GUI), and Tesler accepted an offer for a position splitting his time between the Office System Group and the Learning Research Group, which Kay was heading. Some of Tesler&#x27;s main projects at PARC were the Gypsy word processor for the Office System Group, and Smalltalk, the first dynamic object-oriented programming language, with the Learning Research Group. While working on Gypsy, Tesler and his colleague Tim Mott started writing ideas down envisioning the future of interactive computer use, considering current text-based user interfaces would move to GUIs with icons representing documents, and to develop ease-of-use. From there, the two developed the basic copy and paste function, now a standard feature in computing. Tesler also established the idea that computer interfaces should be modeless, where all actions are available to a user at all times, rather than modal, requiring the user to enter a specific mode to perform them. Gypsy was programmed to include both of these concepts.

Tesler also was part of a team with Adele Goldberg and Douglas Fairbairn that worked on the Xerox NoteTaker, a portable computer system Alan Kay had envisioned. Tesler, then a novice to hardware programming and design, worked with Fairbairn on the design, which included the first functioning Ethernet protocol written in software rather than on hardware. Tesler and Fairbairn took the NoteTaker prototype on cross-country trips to demonstrate the unit to Xerox executives. At one layover during the trip, Tesler and Fairbairn briefly tested the unit at an airport and while in flight, which Tesler believed was the first-ever use of a computer in these situations. The NoteTaker did not gain traction as Xerox had turned its attention back to the Xerox Alto.

Tesler was a proponent of ease-of-use for user interfaces while at PARC. Tesler is considered the originator of the phrase &quot;user-friendly&quot; as a measure of usability after a salesman told him that word processors were difficult to sell because they were &quot;just so unfriendly&quot;. Tesler is also tied to the origins of the phrase &quot;what you see is what you get&quot;; he and his colleagues were complaining about the way documents printed out differently to their appearance on the screen. Tesler said, &quot;What you see on the screen should be what you get when you print it.&quot; Another person simplified this to the well-known abbreviation &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; which gained traction as a functional goal within PARC and beyond. Tesler also is credited with coining the term &quot;browser&quot; after creating a Smalltalk code browser in response to a coworker having difficulty in parsing through someone else&#x27;s code.

Tesler had been present during both of Steve Jobs&#x27;s fateful visits to PARC in late 1979, a couple of years after Jobs had cofounded Apple Computer. During the first visit, Tesler demonstrated to Jobs the Xerox Alto, including its computer mouse-driven GUI features, Gypsy, and Smalltalk. While the Alto had been a mere curiosity for Xerox, Jobs saw a huge amount of potential in the graphical interface, and immediately after returning to Apple&#x27;s headquarters, set his team on creating a similar graphical user interface for their first product, the Apple Lisa, incorporating additional information provided by Xerox, later refined into the first Apple Macintosh. However, while the Macintosh was Apple&#x27;s flagship to becoming a major manufacturer of personal computers, Xerox fell behind.

===Apple Computer===

Tesler was one of several Xerox PARC employees who left the company in 1980 to join Apple Computer following Jobs&#x27;s visits. Tesler said his reasons for leaving included the fact that Apple had clearly gotten the idea of computers and was much more excited in the work PARC was doing while Xerox still thought itself a copier company, and that he found Apple&#x27;s management much more approachable than Xerox&#x27;s. Tesler started at Apple in July 1980 supporting the development of the Apple Lisa, and worked for them until 1997, holding various positions, including Vice President of AppleNet, the division within Apple working on Internet technologies (not to be confused with AppleNet, the never-shipped network for the Lisa), Vice President of the Advanced Technology Group, and Chief Scientist.

Part of Tesler&#x27;s work with the Lisa was to develop object-oriented programming extensions to the Pascal programming language allowing easier manipulation of the GUI. Tesler worked with Pascal&#x27;s creator, Niklaus Wirth, to develop Object Pascal in 1985 which was used to create the Lisa Toolkit. When Apple moved onto the Macintosh platform, the same concepts were brought forward to create MacApp, a similar Object Pascal-based class library for the Macintosh&#x27;s GUI functions released in 1985.

Starting in 1990, Tesler was named vice president of Apple&#x27;s Newton Group under the Advanced Technology Group, and led the efforts of developing the Apple Newton, one of the first personal digital assistants and predecessor of the tablet computer. However, Tesler claimed some decisions related to the Newton&#x27;s release, such as deciding against an Apple-developed handwriting recognition software, over a third-party which slowed down the device, were estimated to have cost Apple millions of dollars. Tesler voluntarily left the group just before the Newton shipped in 1993 and became Apple&#x27;s chief scientist within the Advanced Technology Group. He explored a number of potential projects being developed by the group, but these had been too risky for Apple at the time, so the group focused on networking strategies. Tesler decided to leave Apple in 1997. One of his last acts was to close the Advanced Technology Group as Apple was struggling too much financially to support such a research program at that time.

In 1991, Tesler contributed the article &quot;Networked Computing in the 1990s&quot; to the &quot;Scientific American&quot; Special Issue on Communications, Computers, and Networks of September 1991.

===Later career===
One of the last programs that Tesler oversaw at Apple was a programming language aimed for use by schoolchildren, named Cocoa (unrelated to the Cocoa application programming interface later released by Apple). With Apple&#x27;s permission, Tesler spun out and cofounded Stagecast Software in Palo Alto in 1997, where his small team further developed Stagecast Creator, a programming environment aimed for educational uses that had been under development at Apple. Stagecast Creator was released in 1999, just at the time that the education market had turned financially downhill, and sales of the program were not sufficient to keep the company in business. Tesler dismissed most of the employees in mid-2000, and then left, leaving two employees to continue the company.

Tesler joined Amazon in Seattle in October 2001. Initially he had been hired as a vice president of engineering, and was shortly thereafter promoted to the vice president of shopping experience, where he helped to improve the Amazon website interface, including developing its book preview program. While Tesler enjoyed the job at Amazon, his wife had remained in Silicon Valley, and he also felt distant from venture capitalists that were plentiful in Silicon Valley, and opted to leave Amazon. Tesler moved back to Silicon Valley in 2005 to join Yahoo! as vice president of their User Experience and Design group. After three years, he found that Yahoo! had too many competing product lines and a lack of focus, and left in 2008. He worked for a year at the personal genetics information company 23andMe as product fellow, before establishing himself as an independent consultant in December 2009 to help Silicon Valley companies with designing their user interfaces and experiences.

==Personal life==
After his first marriage ended in divorce in 1969, Tesler married Colleen Barton, a geophysicist.

Tesler had kept his countercultural attitudes beyond his early career, which he became known for at his other positions. He also maintained an attitude that being successful in Silicon Valley was a &quot;rite of passage&quot;, and those who succeed should try to help fund new ventures and to educate others. The Computer History Museum, on Tesler&#x27;s death, described him as having &quot;combined computer science training with a counterculture vision that computers should be for everyone&quot;.

Tesler maintained his strong preference for modeless software well beyond his time at PARC. To promote his preference, as of 1995, Tesler equipped his automobile with a personalized California license plate reading &quot;NOMODES&quot;. Along with others, he had also been using the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t Mode Me In&quot; for years, as a rallying cry to eliminate or reduce usage of modes. His personal website was located at &quot;nomodes.com&quot; (maintained by his family now for historical reference), and on Twitter he had used the handle &quot;@nomodes&quot;.

Tesler died in Portola Valley, California, on February 16, 2020, at the age of 74.

<text>In mathematics, a one-parameter group or one-parameter subgroup usually means a continuous group homomorphism

:formula_1

from the real line formula_2 (as an additive group) to some other topological group formula_3. 
If formula_4 is injective then formula_5, the image, will be a subgroup of formula_3 that is isomorphic to formula_2 as an additive group.

One-parameter groups were introduced by Sophus Lie in 1893 to define infinitesimal transformations. According to Lie, an &quot;infinitesimal transformation&quot; is an infinitely small transformation of the one-parameter group that it generates. It is these infinitesimal transformations that generate a Lie algebra that is used to describe a Lie group of any dimension.

The action of a one-parameter group on a set is known as a flow. A smooth vector field on a manifold, at a point, induces a &quot;local flow&quot; - a one parameter group of local diffeomorphisms, sending points along integral curves of the vector field. The local flow of a vector field is used to define the Lie derivative of tensor fields along the vector field.
==Definition==
A curve formula_8 is called one-parameter subgroup of formula_9 if it satisfies the condition 

:formula_10.

==Examples==
In Lie theory, one-parameter groups correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of the associated Lie algebra. The Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence is the basis of a science begun by Sophus Lie in the 1890s.

Another important case is seen in functional analysis, with formula_3 being the group of unitary operators on a Hilbert space. See Stone&#x27;s theorem on one-parameter unitary groups.

In his monograph &quot;Lie Groups&quot;, P. M. Cohn gave the following theorem:
:Any connected 1-dimensional Lie group is analytically isomorphic either to the additive group of real numbers formula_12, or to formula_13, the additive group of real numbers formula_14. In particular, every 1-dimensional Lie group is locally isomorphic to formula_2.

==Physics==
In physics, one-parameter groups describe dynamical systems. Furthermore, whenever a system of physical laws admits a one-parameter group of differentiable symmetries, then there is a conserved quantity, by Noether&#x27;s theorem.

In the study of spacetime the use of the unit hyperbola to calibrate spatio-temporal measurements has become common since Hermann Minkowski discussed it in 1908. The principle of relativity was reduced to arbitrariness of which diameter of the unit hyperbola was used to determine a world-line. Using the parametrization of the hyperbola with hyperbolic angle, the theory of special relativity provided a calculus of relative motion with the one-parameter group indexed by rapidity. The &quot;rapidity&quot; replaces the &quot;velocity&quot; in kinematics and dynamics of relativity theory. Since rapidity is unbounded, the one-parameter group it stands upon is non-compact. The rapidity concept was introduced by E.T. Whittaker in 1910, and named by Alfred Robb the next year. The rapidity parameter amounts to the length of a hyperbolic versor, a concept of the nineteenth century. Mathematical physicists James Cockle, William Kingdon Clifford, and Alexander Macfarlane had all employed in their writings an equivalent mapping of the Cartesian plane by operator formula_16, where formula_17 is the hyperbolic angle and formula_18.

==In GL(n,C)==

An important example in the theory of Lie groups arises when formula_3 is taken to be formula_20, the group of invertible formula_21 matrices with complex entries. In that case, a basic result is the following:
:Theorem: Suppose formula_22 is a one-parameter group. Then there exists a unique formula_21 matrix formula_24 such that
::formula_25
:for all formula_26.
It follows from this result that formula_4 is differentiable, even though this was not an assumption of the theorem. The matrix formula_24 can then be recovered from formula_4 as
:formula_30.
This result can be used, for example, to show that any continuous homomorphism between matrix Lie groups is smooth.

==Topology==
A technical complication is that formula_5 as a subspace of formula_3 may carry a topology that is coarser than that on formula_2; this may happen in cases where formula_4 is injective. Think for example of the case where formula_3 is a torus formula_36, and formula_4 is constructed by winding a straight line round formula_36 at an irrational slope.

In that case the induced topology may not be the standard one of the real line.

<doc id="754863" wikidata="Q7337534" url="?curid=754863" title="River Ivel">
<text>The River Ivel is a north-flowing river in the western part of east of England. It is primarily in Bedfordshire; it is a tributary of the River Great Ouse and has sources including in the Barton Hills.

==Course==
The river Ivel has four headwaters of equivalent size. By settled convention its name is given frequently to the lower part of the Flit in the south-west and all of its separate south-east headwater which rises in the north of the parish of Baldock in the far north of Hertfordshire. The rest of its course and catchment area is in Bedfordshire. It flows through the parishes of Stotfold, Arlesey, Henlow, Langford, Biggleswade, Sandy and Blunham. It joins the Great Ouse at Tempsford. The total length is about .

==Tributaries==

*The River Hiz joins beside Champneys Henlow, one of four resort hotels.
*The Flit joins the Ivel on the western boundary of Langford and its adjoining Ivel Navigation continuation to Shefford, Bedfordshire has meant the lower Flit is frequently labelled in maps as the Ivel.

==Areas at flood risk==
The watercourse suddenly develops a low gradient. From the Flit confluence to Blunham lakes near its discharge, including parts of the town of Sandy the adjoining land is designated as a Flood Warning Area. The updated map of which area is, using computer flood-risk models and factors such as latest prevention measures, published by the Environment Agency.

==Nature trail==
The Kingfisher Way is a nature trail of , which mostly follows the valley floor from the source at Ivel Springs in Baldock through to its confluence with the River Great Ouse at Tempsford.

==Ivel Navigation==

Plans for a canal for the River Ivel were first announced in 1756. Locks were built in 1758 at Tempsford, Blunham, South Mills and Sandy. Tolls were initially lower than advertised leaving construction capital creditors including members of its maintenance committee in debt. Trade increased rapidly and such loans were redeemed in 1780. The canal was extended to Shefford, with locks at Biggleswade, Holme, Stanford and Clifton; reaching Shefford in 1823.
The canal was abandoned in 1876 when a dam was built across it at Sandy, the relevant local act of Parliament, the (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. cxiv), being passed in the same year.

==History and industrial heritage structures==
A wall of the former wharf at Shefford is beside a bridge over the Flit (tributary).

A maintained towpath adjoins the canalized river. After crossing the footbridge over the River Hit, the path continues straight ahead for some way until the river returns. The canal, made from the river, used to run immediately to the left of the path, but was filled in after World War II as it was considered dangerous. The present course of the river there was originally the millstream for Shefford Mill, close to the remains of the tower mill still visible.

Further on, to the east of the village of Stanford a wooden footbridge crosses the river at the site of Stanford Lock, one of the best preserved on the old canal.

At Radwell, Hertfordshire, an old manor house and mill are situated on the river Ivel, which date back to Edward the Confessor. The Mill was documented in the Doomesday Book of 1086, and declared as worth 6s. 8d. (the equivalent to 48 days&#x27; pay of a skilled tradesman).

==Canoeing and punting==
The Ivel is no longer navigable to barges and is too narrow in many places along its length for single sculling. It can be canoed with care or punted in good conditions for 11 km between Biggleswade upriver to the junction with the Ouse which can equally be canoed, at Tempsford.

==Angling==
Its fishing rights are owned by a mixture of:
*the default owners, the adjoining landowners who own the river to its mid-point by riparian law (unless expressly varied between them or their predecessors)
*by time-limited ownership (lease) or by freehold profit a prendre &quot;in gross&quot; (not tied to any land) in perpetuity by local angling clubs and informal groups of anglers

The Ivel has good condition and large fish when in suitable waters for maturity including barbel (10-17+ lbs), perch to (4 lbs+), chub (7 lbs+), roach to 3lb, carp and pike to 20 lb, and bream to 10lb.

<doc id="754866" wikidata="Q210695" url="?curid=754866" title="Mary Pierce">
<text>Mary Caroline Pierce (born 15 January 1975) is a French former professional tennis player. She was ranked world No. 3 in singles and in doubles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA). Pierce won 18 singles titles on the WTA Tour, including two majors at the 1995 Australian Open and the 2000 French Open, and five Tier I singles events. Pierce was a finalist at a further four singles majors, and twice at the Tour Finals.

In doubles, Pierce won 10 doubles titles on the WTA Tour, including two major titles at the 2000 French Open in women&#x27;s doubles partnering Martina Hingis, and at the 2005 Wimbledon Championships in mixed doubles partnering Mahesh Bhupathi. She was also a runner-up in women&#x27;s doubles at the 2000 Australian Open, partnering Hingis.

Pierce was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2019. She is the most recent Frenchwoman to win the French Open singles title.

==Personal life==
Mary Pierce was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to Yannick Adjaj and Jim Pierce. Her mother is French and her father American, qualifying Pierce for citizenship in all three countries. She was raised in the United States and represented France in international tennis competitions. She speaks English and French fluently, and lives in Mauritius as of May 2019.

Pierce was briefly engaged to baseball player Roberto Alomar in 1999 and later to Air France pilot David Emmanuel Ades, but broke off both engagements.

Pierce had a difficult relationship with her father, who developed a reputation as an abusive tennis father, threatening and even attacking her as well as others. Pierce refused to speak with him for a while and even employed two bodyguards to keep him at bay —and the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association introduced the &quot;Jim Pierce rule&quot; that made it possible to ban parents and coaches from tournaments— but later, the two were eventually reconciled sometime after she retired from active professional tennis.

Pierce is a born again Christian. After a loss in early months of 2000 (before the French Open which she would win), she said she felt &quot;empty and miserable&quot;, but then &quot;I gave my life to Jesus and was born again... things in me changed instantly.&quot; Pierce also credits this change in spiritual direction to her pre-existing friendship with another tennis pro, Linda Wild.

==Career==
===Early years===
Pierce started playing tennis at the age of ten. Two years after being introduced to tennis, for girls aged 12 and under she was ranked No. 2 in the country. In April 1989 at a WTA tournament in Hilton Head, Pierce became the youngest American player (prior to Jennifer Capriati in 1990) to make her debut on the professional tour, aged 14 years and 2 months. Due to her physicality and aggressive approach, her ballstriking was compared to that of Capriati, and she quickly gained a reputation for being one of the hardest hitters on the women&#x27;s circuit. Her dad developed an interest in the sport, and became her coach for many years. She won her first WTA Tour singles tournament in July 1991 in Palermo by defeating Sandra Cecchini in the final.

===1994–2003===
In July 1993, Pierce successfully filed for a restraining order against her father, who was known to be verbally abusive to his daughter and her opponents, and was banned by the WTA from attending her tournaments. Following this split from her father, Pierce was coached by Nick Bollettieri, whose tennis academy she had briefly attended as a teenager in 1988. Her brother David was also Pierce&#x27;s regular coach until 2006. German Aguero, founder of Future Tennis Camps, can also be credited with Pierce&#x27;s early success as he took her in for several years and coached her free of charge.

Pierce reached her first Grand Slam singles final at the 1994 French Open. She conceded just ten games en route to the final, which included a 6–2, 6–2 defeat of world No. 1, Steffi Graf, in the semifinals. In the final, however, Pierce lost to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in straight sets.

The following year, Pierce won her first Grand Slam title for France by defeating Sánchez Vicario in straight sets in the final of the 1995 Australian Open and lost just 30 games in the whole tournament in becoming the first Canadian-born tennis player to win a singles Grand Slam. She reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 3 that year. Pierce also won the Japan Open, defeating Sánchez Vicario in the final.

Pierce suffered a series of setbacks in 1996, including her split with Nick Bollettieri, after failing to defend her title at the Australian Open. Aside from a runner-up finish at the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island and a semifinal finish in Hamburg, the highlight of the year for Pierce was her first appearance in the Wimbledon quarterfinals.

Pierce was back in the Australian Open singles final in 1997, where she lost to Martina Hingis in straight sets. She also lost in that year&#x27;s WTA Tour Championships final to Jana Novotná. Pierce was a member of the French team that won the 1997 Fed Cup, and her only title that season was the Italian Open, defeating Conchita Martínez in the final. Pierce won the Comeback Player of the Year award for ending the year at world No. 7 after starting at world No. 21.

She won four titles in 1998: the Paris indoor event, the Amelia Island Championships, the Kremlin Cup, and the Luxembourg Open. In addition, she was runner-up at the San Diego Classic.

Pierce won her second Grand Slam singles title and her first Grand Slam doubles title at the 2000 French Open. In the singles final, she defeated Martínez to become the first French woman to claim the title since Françoise Dürr in 1967. She also partnered with Hingis to win the women&#x27;s doubles crown, their second Grand Slam tournament of the year after the Australian Open. Her ranking dropped to No. 130 at the end of 2001 and reached almost 300 in April 2002.

Pierce helped France win the Fed Cup for a second time in 2003 by defeating the United States in the final.

===2004–2005===
After a few quiet years on the tour, Pierce won her first title since the 2000 French Open at the Rosmalen Open on grass in 2004. At the Olympics in Athens, Pierce defeated sixth-seeded Venus Williams in the third round before losing to top-seeded and eventual gold-medallist Justine Henin of Belgium in the quarterfinals. At the US Open later in the year, Pierce defeated recent Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, before losing to eventual champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round.

Pierce then made it back into the top ranks of the women&#x27;s game in 2005. At the French Open, she reached the singles final for the third time, where she lost to Henin in straight sets, losing 1–6, 1–6 in just over one hour. She then reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon for the first time since 1996. Pierce faced Venus Williams in that quarterfinal and lost the match after a second set tiebreak consisting of 22 points. Pierce also won the mixed-doubles title at Wimbledon, partnering Mahesh Bhupathi. In August, she won her first singles title of the year at the Acura Classic in San Diego, defeating Ai Sugiyama in the final.

In the fourth round of the US Open, Pierce defeated Henin for the first time in her career. In the quarterfinals, she beat third seeded Amélie Mauresmo to reach her first US Open semifinal. After the victory, Pierce remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m 30 and I have been on the tour for 17 years and there are still firsts for me. That&#x27;s pretty amazing.&quot; She reached the final by defeating Elena Dementieva in three sets in the semifinals, taking a medical time-out after the first set. This caused controversy, many believing that this disrupted Dementieva&#x27;s rhythm and concentration. In the final, she lost to Kim Clijsters in straight sets. But Pierce won her second title of the year at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. In her quarterfinal match against Elena Likhovtseva, Pierce came back from 0–6, and thus six match points, in the third set tiebreak and won eight consecutive points to reach the semifinals.

The win in Moscow secured her spot at the year-ending championships in Los Angeles where the top eight singles players competed for the winner&#x27;s prize of one million dollars. In round-robin play with her assigned group of four players, she won all three matches: against Clijsters in three sets; Mauresmo in three sets; and Dementieva in straight sets. In the semifinals, Pierce beat top-ranked Lindsay Davenport in two tiebreaks; however, Pierce lost the final to Mauresmo in a match lasting just over three hours.

Pierce&#x27;s year-end ranking was world No. 5 compared to her year-beginning ranking of world No. 29. This matched her career-best performances of 1994, 1995, and 1999, and she was less than 200 points behind Sharapova for world No. 4 and less than 300 points behind Mauresmo for world No. 3. Pierce&#x27;s return to form in 2005 was one of the surprising tennis stories of the year. Her successful performance in 2005 also encouraged the former world No. 1 player, Martina Hingis, to return to the game.

===2006===
Pierce trained hard in the off-season in a bid to win major titles in 2006. Her first tournament of the year was the Australian Open. She defeated Nicole Pratt of Australia in the first round before losing to Iveta Benešová of the Czech Republic in the second round. The loss denied her a third-round match with Martina Hingis. Pierce reached the final of her next tournament, the Gaz de France in Paris, where she lost to compatriot Amélie Mauresmo in straight sets. Pierce did not play again until August because of foot and groin injuries, withdrawing from the French Open and Wimbledon.

After spending six months away from the tour, Pierce began her comeback at the Acura Classic, where she was the 2005 champion. She lost in the quarterfinals to Maria Sharapova. In just her second tournament in over six months, Pierce played at the US Open and lost to Li Na, the 24th seed from China, in the third round. Pierce then lost in the first round of the next three tournaments she played. She was defeated at the Luxembourg Open by Alona Bondarenko, who went on to win the title. Jelena Janković defeated Pierce in Stuttgart and Katarina Srebotnik defeated Pierce at the Zurich Open.

====Knee injury====
At the Generali Ladies Linz tournament in October 2006, Pierce defeated Ai Sugiyama in the first round and was leading against Vera Zvonareva 6–4, 6–5 in the second round when she ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. She had held three match points before the injury. Pierce underwent a successful operation in December 2006 and missed all of 2007. She was expected to return to the tour in 2008, but at the end of that year she was still sidelined with no projected return date. However, she stated that she was still not ready to retire.

Pierce made an appearance at the 2007 French Open as an avenue at Roland Garros was named in her honor – &quot;Allée Mary Pierce&quot;. She also helped with the social side to the French Open, taking part in the post-match ceremony after the women&#x27;s final. Pierce was named as a member of the French Olympic team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 21 July 2008, however, Pierce withdrew from the Olympics because of injury.

Pierce, Caroline Wozniacki and Ana Ivanovic are the only three women to win both the championship and the wooden spoon at a Grand Slam tournament. Pierce&#x27;s wooden spoon came at the 2002 Australian Open, where she retired in the first round to Jill Craybas; she was the champion in 1995, making her the first player to win both the championship and wooden spoon at the same Grand Slam tournament. Jeļena Ostapenko has since achieved the same distinction, winning the 2017 French Open but winning the wooden spoon in her title defence the very next year.

, Pierce lives in Black River, Mauritius, where she teaches tennis.

==Playing style==
Pierce was an aggressive baseline player who had a reputation for being one of the hardest hitters on the WTA tour and would dictate a match from the first point. Her greatest strength was her forehand, which was hit hard and flat and could be used to hit winners from any position on the court. Her two-handed backhand was similarly hit flat and was used to attack weak second serves and create sharp angles around the court. Her first serve was powerful, typically being served at and being recorded as high as , meaning that she aced frequently. Pierce also possessed an effective kick serve which was frequently deployed as a second serve, typically averaging . She was one of the most aggressive players on return and could hit return winners at will. She was one of the least defensive players on the tour, predicating her game on raw power and aggression. Pierce&#x27;s major weakness was her inconsistency. When she was in good form, she was one of the most dangerous players on the tour, accumulating high numbers of winners to a low number of unforced errors. In poor form, however, her aggressive game led to a high number of unforced errors. Her game was also heavily affected by nerves, and, when nervous, she would take increasingly long amounts of time preparing between points. Pierce&#x27;s preferred surfaces were clay and hard courts.

==Equipment==
In the early 2000s, Pierce wore Nike apparel and used Yonex racquets on court.

<doc id="754871" wikidata="Q1574972" url="?curid=754871" title="Law of Suspects">
<text>:&quot;Note: This decree should not be confused with the Law of General Security (), also known as the &quot;Law of Suspects,&quot; adopted by Napoleon III in 1858 that allowed punishment for any prison action, and permitted the arrest and deportation, without judgment, of anyone convicted of political offenses after 1848.&quot;

The Law of Suspects () was a decree passed by the French National Convention on 17 September 1793, during the French Revolution. Some historians consider this decree the start of the Reign of Terror; they argue that the decree marked a significant weakening of individual freedoms that led to &quot;revolutionary paranoia&quot; that swept the nation.

The law ordered the arrest of all avowed enemies and suspected enemies of the Revolution, and specifically aimed at unsubmissive former nobles, émigrés, officials removed or suspended from office, officers suspected of treason, and hoarders of goods.

The following year, the decree was expanded and became more strict. Implementation of the law and arrests were entrusted to oversight committees, and not to the legal authorities. The decree also introduced the maxim that subjects had to prove their innocence, which was later extended by the Law of 22 Prairial (10 June 1794). &lt;br&gt;

The decree, with its effect of &quot;Terror&quot;, lasted until 5 August 1794, when the Convention decided the release of all the prisoners, against whom &quot;weighs no charge&quot;. 

==History==
The Law of Suspects, actually a decree rather than a law, was based on a proposal by Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai and Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, approved by the National Convention of the French First Republic. It supplemented an earlier law of 10 March 1793, which created the revolutionary tribunals but contained a much narrower definition of suspects.

Before its enactment, obstinate, anti-republican Catholic priests, called &#x27;refractory clergy&#x27; (), were alleged to be royalist suspects by the Decree of 17 November 1791. Beginning on 10 August 1792, when the constitutional reign of Louis XVI was suspended by the Legislative Assembly, these priests, as well as émigrés and their parents, had been expelled, deported, jailed, and sometimes murdered by radical revolutionary &quot;sans-culottes&quot;.

The term &quot;suspect&quot; had been in common parlance by 1793, but had not been defined by consensus. Radical sections of Paris demanded that these &quot;suspects&quot; be arrested, but National Convention failed to act decisively. On 23 March it ordered a disarmament of suspects and, on 2 June, it decreed that those &quot;notoriously suspected of aristocracy and bad citizenship&quot; should be arrested.

The &quot;Law of Suspects&quot; was finally debated after the invasion of the National Convention by the sections of Paris on 5 September. Its purpose was to define broadly who was to be arrested and examined before revolutionary tribunals. It also forced legislature to adopt the Maximum.

The Committee of Public Safety was given broad powers to arrest and punish. On its behalf, the Surveillance Committees, constituted by a law of 21 March 1793, were responsible for drawing up lists of suspects and for issuing arrest warrants. Citizens were required to carry &quot;certificates of civism&quot;, attesting to the bearer&#x27;s good citizenship.

The famous definition of suspects as: &quot;Those who have done nothing against freedom, also have done nothing for it,&quot; was part of a provision written by the regional Paris Commune on 11 October 1793. It is often wrongly attributed to wording in the &quot;Law of Suspects&quot; itself.

== Text of the decree ==

Decree that orders the arrest of Suspect People. 

:: &quot;Of 17 September 1793.&quot;

&quot;The National Convention, having heard the report of its legislative committee on the method of bringing into effect its decree of last 12 August, decrees the following:&quot;

&quot;Art. I. Immediately after publication of this decree, all suspect people who are to be found on the territory of the Republic, and who are still in freedom, will be put under arrest.&quot;

&quot;II. Considered as suspect people are: &lt;br&gt;1º Those who, either by their conduct, or their relations, or by their words or writings, have shown themselves to be partisans of tyranny or of federalism, and enemies of freedom; &lt;br&gt;2º Those who cannot justify, in the manner prescribed by the decree of last 21 March, their means of existence and the acquittal of their civic duties; &lt;br&gt;3º Those to whom have been denied certificates of good citizenship; &lt;br&gt;4º Public officials who have been suspended or discharged from their functions by the National Convention or its commissioners and have not been reinstated, notably those who have been or ought to be discharged under the law of last 14 August; &lt;br&gt;5º Those former nobles, with their husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, son or daughters, brothers or sisters, and agents of émigrés, who have not consistently demonstrated their commitment to the Revolution; &lt;br&gt;6º Those who have emigrated during the interval between 1 July 1789 and the publication of the law of 8 April 1792, even if they have returned to France within the time prescribed by that law, or earlier; &lt;br&gt;7º Those who have been considered a vagabond or cannot pay local and federal taxes decreed by the National Assembly.&quot;

==Estimated number of victims==
* Donald Greer: 500,000 accused suspects under the Terror, based on research into historical records. 35,000 to 40,000 casualties, including 16,594 executed following legal processes, and the other executions corresponding to the areas of civil war. 
* Albert Mathiez: 300,000 victims. In Paris originally 6,000, and more than 8,000 on the eve of the Thermidorian Reaction.
* Louis Jacob: 70,000 suspects. 
* Jean Tulard: 500,000 prisoners and 300,000 people assigned to house arrest. 
* The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; puts the number detained by the law at &quot;more than 200,000,&quot; noting that most never stood trial although they languished in disease infested prisons where 10,000 perished, and military commissions and revolutionary tribunals gave death sentences to 17,000 others. 
* Jean-Louis Matharan: Considers that &quot;any overall figure of detained suspects remain in the state is pure conjecture,&quot; especially since, from August 1792 to Thermidor Year II, &quot;the release of jailed suspects was uninterrupted,&quot; although there were likely fewer arrests, and that there have been claims about the rapid release of those arrested and shorter terms of imprisonment.

==End of the law==
The &quot;Law of Suspects&quot; fell into disuse by 5 August 1794, which meant the end of &quot;the Terror&quot;. Direction was replaced by revolutionary surveillance committees (&quot;Comité de surveillance révolutionnaire&quot;) responsible for the practical exercise of repression, with oversight by district committees.

<text>John William &quot;Jack&quot; Vessey Jr. (29 June 1922 – 18 August 2016) was a career officer in the United States Army. He attained the rank of general, and was most notable for his service as the tenth chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

A native of Minneapolis, Vessey began his 46-year military career in 1939 when he joined the Minnesota Army National Guard&#x27;s 59th Field Artillery Brigade, a unit of the 34th Infantry Division. His unit was activated for World War II, and he took part in combat in the North African and Italian Campaigns. Vessey received a battlefield commission to second lieutenant during the Battle of Anzio, and served as a field artillery forward observer until the end of the war. After the war, Vessey advanced through positions of increasing rank and responsibility. During the Vietnam War, he served as executive officer of the 25th Infantry Division Artillery and acting commander of 2nd Battalion, 77th Field Artillery, and he received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism during the Battle of Suoi Tre. He served as commander of the 3rd Armored Division Artillery from 1967 to 1969, and division chief of staff from 1969 to 1970.

Vessey was promoted to brigadier general in 1970, and assigned as commander of U.S. Army Supply Thailand, a logistics support area for soldiers serving in Vietnam. He commanded U.S. military activities in Laos from 1973 to 1974, when he was promoted to major general as commander of the 4th Infantry Division. In 1975, Vessey was promoted to lieutenant general and assigned as the Army&#x27;s deputy chief of staff for operations and plans, G-3. He was promoted to general in 1976, and named to command United States Forces Korea and the Eighth United States Army. In 1978, Vessey also assumed command of the Republic of Korea-United States Combined Forces Command. He served in South Korea until 1979, when he was assigned as Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army.

In 1982, President Ronald Reagan named Vessey as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He served until retiring in October 1985. After leaving the Army, Vessey became involved in efforts to account for military personnel listed as missing in action, and made several trips to Southeast Asia to search for remains as part of resolving the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992. Vessey died in North Oaks, Minnesota, on 18 August 2016. He was buried at the Minnesota State Veterans Cemetery in Little Falls.

==Early life and education==
Vessey was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 29 June 1922, the son of John William Vessey and Emily Katherine (Roche) Vessey. He attended the schools of Minneapolis, and was 16 in May 1939 when he claimed to be 18 so that he could enlist in the Minnesota Army National Guard. Vessey was assigned as a motorcycle courier in the 59th Field Artillery Brigade, 34th Infantry Division. In 1940, he graduated from Roosevelt High School. In February 1941, his unit was activated for training and mobilization in anticipation of U.S. participation in World War II.

==Military career==
===World War II===
Vessey served with the 34th Infantry Division throughout its World War II service. The experience of early American setbacks in North Africa left Vessey with a lifelong appreciation of the need for realistic combat training, modern equipment, physical fitness, and air-ground cooperation. When Major General Omar Bradley, commander of II Corps in North Africa, launched the U.S. drive on Bizerte in April 1943, he gave the 34th the most difficult objective: the well-defended Hill 609. In the first clear-cut U.S. Army victory of the campaign, the 34th Division took its objective, opening the way for the U.S. advance on Bizerte. Vessey, who had been a first sergeant since 1 September 1942, later described being a first sergeant in combat as the toughest job he had. Vessey was with the 34th when it went ashore on the Anzio beachhead in Italy in May 1944; there he received a battlefield commission as a second lieutenant, after which he served as a forward observer.

===Korean War and afterwards===
After the war, most of Vessey&#x27;s service continued to be in field artillery assignments. In the 1950s, he served with the 4th Infantry Division in Germany and the Eighth U.S. Army in the Republic of Korea. During this period, Vessey also attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

By the time Vessey became a lieutenant colonel, he had earned enough credits through night school and correspondence courses for a Bachelor of Science degree in military science, which he received from the University of Maryland University College in 1963. In 1965, he received a Master of Science degree in business administration from George Washington University. From 1963 to 1965, Vessey commanded 2nd Battalion, 73rd Field Artillery, 3rd Armored Division; then he spent a year as a student at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces.

===Vietnam War===
During the Vietnam War, Vessey served for a year as Executive Officer of the 25th Infantry Division Artillery in Vietnam. In March 1967, when acting as commander of the 2nd Battalion, 77th Artillery, he was given the mission of establishing a fire support base at Suoi Tre during Operation Junction City. Deep in enemy-controlled territory, Vessey and his men oriented the firebase&#x27;s defenses on the enemy&#x27;s likely avenues of approach and rehearsed counterattack plans. During an attack by a reinforced regiment, the base was partially overrun. Vessey and his men fired their howitzers directly into the enemy ranks. Although greatly outnumbered, the defenders, aided by gunships and artillery, killed four hundred of their assailants while successfully defending the firebase. Lieutenant Colonel Vessey received the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the battle.

From Vietnam, Vessey went to Germany to serve first as Commander of the 3rd Armored Division Artillery from October 1967 until March 1969 and then as Division Chief of Staff for a year. He was promoted to colonel in November 1967. As a colonel, he was a student at the Army helicopter school at the age of 48. Vessey went back to Southeast Asia in December 1970 to head the U.S. Army Support Command, Thailand. In January 1972, he went into Laos to coordinate all US military operations in support of the war in that country. Vessey worked with the U.S. ambassador, the CIA station chief, and an assortment of military contingents. When the Laotian ceasefire came in February 1973, the Royal Lao government controlled all the major cities and the vast majority of the population.

===After the Vietnam War===
Upon his return to the United States, Vessey became Director of Operations in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. Promoted to major general in August 1974, he assumed command of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Carson, Colorado. Promoted to lieutenant general in September 1975, Vessey became the Army&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans.

Vessey received his fourth star in 1976. From 1976 to 1979, he served in the Republic of Korea as Commanding General of the Eighth U.S. Army; Commander of U.S. Forces, Korea; and Commander in Chief of the United Nations Command. In 1978, Vessey became the first Commander in Chief of the Republic of Korea-United States Combined Forces Command. His tour was marked by increased military tension, caused by evidence of a North Korean buildup and by President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1977 announcement that U.S. ground forces would be withdrawn. Vessey worked to assuage South Korean concerns and change the President&#x27;s decision. After Carter&#x27;s 1979 visit, withdrawal plans were suspended and then cancelled. From July 1979 until June 1982, Vessey served as Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army.

===Chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===
On 18 June 1982, Vessey became the tenth Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the last World War II combat veteran to serve in the position. Vessey was the only chairman who had been neither a service chief nor a commander of a unified or specified command. He served as chairman during a period of unprecedented growth in peacetime defense spending and an expanded U.S. military presence worldwide intended to counter growing Soviet military power.

Vessey and the service chiefs believed that their overriding task lay in convincing Soviet leaders that their quest for military superiority and geostrategic advantage was fruitless. In Europe, they pushed the controversial but successful deployment of Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles to offset the Soviet SS-20 missiles. In southwest Asia, highly visible US military activities underscored the US commitment to defend its vital interests in the region. In Central America, training and intelligence were provided to support counter-insurgency efforts.

In June 1982, Vessey received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by his predecessor, Awards Council member General David C. Jones, USAF.

Believing that it was a mistake to commit a superpower&#x27;s forces to a peacekeeping mission, Vessey and the Joint Chiefs in 1982 and 1983 advised against deployment of a Marine contingent to Lebanon as part of a multinational peacekeeping force intended to restore peace among warring factions there. Their advice was not taken, and on 23 October 1983, a truck-bomb attack on the Marine headquarters building in Beirut killed 241 US Marines and Army soldiers. In February 1984, President Ronald Reagan withdrew the contingent from Lebanon.

Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger understood the importance of decentralization; he authorized Vessey to direct military operations on the Secretary&#x27;s behalf. The 1983 Grenada operation, for example, was planned by Atlantic Command, reviewed by the Joint Chiefs, and approved by Secretary Weinberger and the President—all in four days. Vessey oversaw execution of the operation that rescued US citizens and brought a pro-US government into power. On 30 October 1983, Vessey made a one-day inspection visit to the island and left his personal mark on the 8-day operation. He urged the on-scene commanders to move aggressively to secure full control of the multi-island nation and also improve living conditions for 666 Cuban detainees. On his return home, Vessey faced a firestorm from the American news media over the Pentagon&#x27;s actions barring journalists from the battlefield until the third day of the operation. Vessey responded to the criticism by appointing a study group, known as the Sidle Panel, which recommended new guidelines for military-media relations that he embraced as Pentagon policy the following year. 

During Vessey&#x27;s tenure, there was increased emphasis on space as a theater of operations. In early 1983, the Joint Chiefs mentioned to the President that defense against nuclear-armed missiles might be technically feasible in the next century. To their surprise, Reagan seized upon the concept and on 23 March 1983, announced his vision of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Realizing the enormous military advantages to be gained from operations in space and to support SDI, the JCS recommended the establishment of a unified command for space. US Space Command was activated on 23 September 1985.

===Vietnamese emissary===
Vessey retired on 30 September 1985, several months before the expiration of his second term as Chairman. He was the last four-star World War II combat veteran on active duty and, with forty-six years of service, had served the longest of anyone then in the Army. President Reagan praised Vessey and gave a moving speech on his behalf. The President pointed out that Vessey had served in many leadership positions in his career and stated:

In retirement, he served President Reagan and his successors, Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as a special emissary to Vietnam on the question of American service personnel missing from the Vietnam War. For his work in Vietnam, General Vessey was awarded the prestigious Sylvanus Thayer Award from the United States Military Academy in 1996. He was also awarded the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1992.

==Personal life==
Vessey married Avis Claire Funk in 1945. They had two sons, John III and David, and a daughter, Sarah.

Vessey died in North Oaks, Minnesota, on 18 August 2016, aged 94.

<doc id="754889" wikidata="Q661534" url="?curid=754889" title="House of Barcelona">
<text>The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162) until 1410. They descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wilfred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the &quot;infanta&quot; Eleanor of the house of Barcelona.

<doc id="754903" wikidata="Q360383" url="?curid=754903" title="Gil Vicente">
<text>Gil Vicente (; c. 1465c. 1536), called the Trobadour, was a Portuguese playwright and poet who acted in and directed his own plays. Considered the chief dramatist of Portugal he is sometimes called the &quot;Portuguese Plautus,&quot; often referred to as the &quot;Father of Portuguese drama&quot; and as one of Western literature&#x27;s greatest playwrights. Also noted as a lyric poet, Vicente worked in Spanish as much as he worked in Portuguese and is thus, with Juan del Encina, considered joint-father of Spanish drama.

Vicente was attached to the courts of the Portuguese kings Manuel I and John III. He rose to prominence as a playwright largely on account of the influence of Queen Dowager Leonor, who noticed him as he participated in court dramas and subsequently commissioned him to write his first theatrical work.

He may also have been identical to an accomplished goldsmith of the same name at the court of Évora; the goldsmith is mentioned in royal documents from 1509 to 1517 and worked for the widow of King John II, Dona Leonor. He was the creator of the famous Belém Monstrance, and master of rhetoric of King Manuel I.

His plays and poetry, written in both Portuguese and Spanish, were a reflection of the changing times during the transition from Middle Ages to Renaissance and created a balance between the former time of rigid mores and hierarchical social structure and the new society in which this order was undermined.

While many of Vicente&#x27;s works were composed to celebrate religious and national festivals or to commemorate events in the life of the royal family, others draw upon popular culture to entertain, and often to critique, Portuguese society of his day.

Though some of his works were later suppressed by the Portuguese Inquisition, causing his fame to wane, he is now recognised as one of the principal figures of the Portuguese Renaissance.

==Life==
The year 1465, the date proposed by Queirós Veloso, is the commonly accepted year of Vicente&#x27;s birth. However, Braamcamp Freire proposes the year 1460, while de Brito Rebelo proposes between 1470 and 1475. Vicente&#x27;s own works indicate contradictory dates. The &quot;Velho da Horta&quot; (&quot;Old Man of the [Vegetable] Garden&quot;), the &quot;Floresta de Enganos&quot; (&quot;Forest of Mistakes&quot;), and the &quot;Auto da Festa&quot; (&quot;Act of the Party&quot;) indicate 1452, 1470, and before 1467, respectively. Since 1965, when official festivities commemorating the 500th birthday of the writer were held, the date of 1465 has been almost universally accepted.

Though Frei Pedro de Poiares conjectured Barcelos was Vicente&#x27;s birthplace, evidence for this is scarce. Despite this, the people of Barcelos honored the playwright by naming their own football club after him. Pires de Lima, on the other hand, proposed Guimarães, which better accounts for Vicente&#x27;s identification as a jeweller. The people of Guimarães have embraced this theory; a municipal school in Urgezes is named after the playwright. There are some stories about Gil Vicente&#x27;s father, that he was from this parish in Guimarães, so people believe that Gil Vicente had lived here too. Another conjecture places his birthplace at Lisbon. The Beira region is also a candidate because of various references to it in his plays, more exactly the location of Guimarães de Tavares, that has been mistaken with Guimarães.

Gil Vicente married Branca Bezerra, who bore him two sons: Gaspar Vicente (died 1519) and Belchior Vicente (born 1505). After her death, he married Melícia or Milícia Rodrigues (abbreviated as Roiz), of whom were born the noted scholar Paula Vicente (1519–1576), Luís Vicente de Crasto (who organised the compilation of Vicente&#x27;s works), married to Mór de Almeida and had issue, Joana de Pina (died 1584) (daughter of Diogo de Pina de Baião and wife Mécia Barreto, daughter of Francisco de Aguiar and wife Madalena Barreto) and had issue, and Isabel de Castro, without issue, and Valéria Borges (or Vicente), who was married firstly to Pero Machado, without issue, and secondly to António de Meneses, son of Luís de Meneses, of the bastards of the Lords de Cantanhede, and wife Brites de Aguiar, and had issue.

It is well known the presence of the playwright in Santarém, on 26 January, during the 1531 Lisbon Earthquake, where rumors quickly spread, apparently encouraged by the friars of Santarém, that the disaster was divine punishment (Latin: &quot;Ira Dei&quot;- Wrath of God) and that the Jewish community was to blame. Faced with social instability in the city Gil Vicent, reportedly, personally defused the situation while scolding the friars for their fear-mongering in a powerfully written letter to King John III, and possibly averting a massacre of Jews and recent converts to Christianity.

Vicente&#x27;s last work is dated to 1536, and he was dead by 1540. The precise year of his death is unknown, and the location is variously given as Évora or Torres Vedras.

==Career==
It is assumed that Vicente studied in Salamanca. Though he initially studied law, he soon abandoned it for literature.

===As a writer===

In 1493, he was acting as master of rhetoric to the Duke of Beja, afterwards King Manuel, a post which gave him admission to the court. His first known work, &quot;O Monólogo do vaqueiro&quot; (&quot;Monologue of the Cowherd&quot;), was written in Spanish and acted in the rooms of Maria of Aragon, wife of King Manuel, to celebrate the birth of Prince John (later John III of Portugal). The first performance, recited by the playwright himself, took place on the night of 8 June 1502, in the presence of the king; the queen; Leonor of Viseu, former Queen of Portugal and widow of John II; and Beatriz of Portugal, mother of the King.

&quot;O Monólogo do vaqueiro&quot; contains several elements clearly inspired by the Adoration of the Shepherds which takes place in accounts of Christ&#x27;s birth. Its staging included offerings of simple and rustic gifts, such as cheese, to the future king, from whom great achievements were expected.

Though Leonor asked him to give an encore performance of the play at the Christmas matins, Vicente decided to write a new play for the occasion, the &quot;Auto Pastoril Castelhano&quot; (&quot;Castilian Pastoral Act&quot;). The court, pleased again, required a further diversion for Twelfth Night, whereupon he produced the &quot;Auto of the Wise Kings&quot;. Because of the influence of Queen Leonor, who would become his greatest patron in the years to come, Gil Vicente realized that his talent would allow him to do much more than simply adapt his first work for similar occasions.

Vicente, who was in charge of organizing events in the palace, also directed the commemoration in honour of Eleanor of Spain, the third wife of Manuel I, in 1520. In 1521, he began serving John III of Portugal, and soon achieved the social status necessary to satirize the clergy and nobility with impunity. His popularity even enabled him to contradict the opinions of the king, as he did in a 1531 letter defending the New Christians.

For thirty years he entertained the courts, accompanying them as they moved from place to place, and providing by his autos a distraction in times of calamity, and in times of rejoicing giving expression to the feelings of the people. Though himself both actor and author, Gil Vicente had no regular company of players, but it is probable that he easily found students and court servants willing to get up a part for a small fee, especially as the plays would not ordinarily run for more than one night.

===As a goldsmith===
Many works about Gil Vicente associate him with a goldsmith of the same name at the court of Évora; technical terms used by the playwright lend credibility to this identification.

In 1881, Camilo Castelo Branco wrote the letter &quot;&quot; (&quot;Gil Vicente, Refutations of the Opinion of Mr. Teófilo Braga&quot;), which argued that Gil Vicente the writer and Gil Vicente the goldsmith were two different people. Teófilo Braga, who initially believed them to be the same man, later adopted a different opinion after reading a study by Sanches de Baena which showed the different genealogy of two individuals named Gil Vicente. However, Brito Rebelo demonstrated the historical inconsistency of these two genealogies by the use of documents from the Portuguese national archive.

The masterpiece of Vicente the goldsmith&#x27;s art was the monstrance of Belém made for the Jerónimos Monastery in 1506, which was crafted from the first gold exported from Mozambique. The design of this monstrance resembles the decorations of the southern portal of the church Santa Maria de Belém of this monastery.

Three years later, he became overseer of the of the Convento de Cristo in Tomar, Nossa Senhora de Belém, and the Hospital de Todos-os-Santos in Lisbon. In 1511, he was nominated vassal of the King, and a year later he was the representative jeweller in the Casa dos Vinte e Quatro. In 1513, as master of the balance of the Casa da Moeda, the Portuguese national mint, Vicente the goldsmith was elected by the others masters to represent them in Lisbon.

==Written works==


Vicente&#x27;s oeuvre spans the years between 1500 and 1536. Most of his plays were intended for performance at court, where he and the ladies and gentlemen of the court participated in their production. He wrote no fewer than forty-four pieces, ten of which are in Spanish, fourteen in Portuguese, and the remainder in mingled Portuguese and Spanish. His plays may be grouped into four main categories: acts, or devotional plays; comedies tragicomedies; and farces.

Like Spain&#x27;s classical dramas, his plays are often in verse form. In addition, they feature his own musical compositions and well as popular lyrics and melodies of the time.

He was also a noted lyric poet in both Portuguese and Spanish, as represented by several poems in the &quot;Cancioneiro&quot; of Garcia de Resende. He wrote a number of &quot;vilancetes&quot; and &quot;cantigas&quot; (&quot;songs&quot;) which were influenced by a palatial style and the themes of the troubadours.

Some of his works are profoundly religious, while other are particularly satirical, particularly when commenting upon what Vicente perceived as the corruption of the clergy and the superficial glory of empire which concealed the increasing poverty of Portugal&#x27;s lower classes.

===Characteristics===
Vicente&#x27;s works were partially influenced by the Iberian popular and religious theatre that was already being done. Pastoral themes present in the writings of Juan del Encina strongly influenced Vicente&#x27;s early works and continued to inform his later, more sophisticated plays. The humanism of Erasmus and of Renaissance Italy also impacted his work.

Luís Vicente, his son, classified Vicente&#x27;s sacred plays as acts and mysteries and his secular plays as farces, comedies, and tragicomedies. His plays may be further divided into pastoral acts, religious allegories, biblical narratives, episodical farces, and narrative acts. However, many of his works blend both secular and sacred elements; for example, &quot;Triologia das Barcas&quot; (&quot;Trilogy of the Ships&quot;) contains both farcical and religious motifs.

Vicente is one of the most important satirical authors of the Portuguese language. His satires were severely critical, anticipating Jean-Baptiste de Santeul&#x27;s later epigram (often mistakenly attributed to Horace or Molière), &quot;castigat ridendo mores&quot; (&quot;[Comedy] criticises customs through humour&quot;). He portrayed Portuguese society of the 16th century with perceptiveness and insight, using many characters inspired by Portuguese social stereotypes of his time. In addition, rustic characters, such as sailors, gypsies, and peasants, are common, as are more fantastical characters such as fairies and demons. Though he commonly referenced popular dialects, Vicente maintained the lyricism of his words.

Positive aspects of Vicente&#x27;s works include imagination, originality, and a proficiency in technical knowledge of theatre. Though spontaneous, sardonic, and emotive, his works maintain a directness and simplicity of dialogue which is lyrical without being florid or exaggerated. He expresses himself in an unexpected, Dionysian way which does not always obey the aesthetic and artistic principles of balance. Vicente&#x27;s works seem to show a spirit in conflict: his portrayals of the flaws of others appear almost rash and cruel, while his devotional and pastoral works, and those scenes in which he defends the oppressed, give an impression of tenderness, docility, and humaneness. In contrast, his works sometimes include a romanticism which combines eroticism and with more erudite influences such as Petrarch.

===Philosophical elements===
The worlds presented in Vicente&#x27;s works could be considered as representative of the duality of Platonic idealism. The first world is the abstract, an ideal place of serenity and divine love that leads to inner peace, quietness, and &quot;resplendent glory&quot;, according to his letter to John III of Portugal. The second world, which he portrays in his farces, is the physical: a false world, tired, without order or remedy, and lacking in strength.

His satirical works depict the second world, in which human flaws are caricatured with little regard for actual or historical truth. Though critics call attention to these anachronisms and narrative inconsistencies, it&#x27;s possible that Vicente considered these errors trivial in his portrayals of an already false and imperfect world. In contrast, his representations of the mythic, symbolic, and religious aspects of Christmas, such as the figure of the Virgin Mother, the infant Jesus, and Christmas Eve, demonstrate a harmony and purity which is not present in his social commentary.

Unlike plays which echo Manichaeism by presenting the dichotomy of darkness and light, Vicente&#x27;s work juxtaposes the two elements in order to illustrate the necessity of both. Christmas eve, one of his common motifs, is symbolic of his philosophical and religious views: the great darkness borders the divine glory of maternity, birth, forgiveness, serenity, and good will. The darkness is necessary to provide contrast with the light.

Though his patriotism is apparent in works such as &quot;Exortação da Guerra&quot; (&quot;Exhortation of War&quot;) and &quot;Auto da Fama&quot; (&quot;Act of Fame&quot;), or &quot;Cortes de Júpiter&quot; (&quot;Courts of Jupiter&quot;), it doesn&#x27;t merely glorify the Portuguese Empire; instead, it is critical and ethically concerned, especially with the newly available vices which arose due to commerce with the East, that brought a sudden enrichment and disruption of the social fabric.

===Religious plays===
Many of Vicente&#x27;s plays were composed in order to celebrate religious festivals; these seventeen plays are called his &quot;Obras de devoção&quot; (&quot;Devotional works&quot;). In these plays, also called &quot;autos&quot;, or &quot;acts&quot;, Vicente blended themes from Medieval morality plays with theatrical mumming and the liturgical dramas that were used in Corpus Christi festivals.

One of his first devotional plays was &quot;Auto da Fé&quot; (&quot;Act of Faith&quot;) in 1510. Like a morality play, it explores the journey of the Soul as it travels to the arms of the Mother Church. On its way, it is waylaid by the Devil and led to goodness by an Angel.

His magnum opus is considered to be the &quot;Triologia das Barcas&quot; (&quot;Trilogy of the Ships&quot;), which consists of the three plays &quot;Auto da Barca do Inferno&quot; (&quot;Act of the Ship of Hell&quot;), written 1516; &quot;Auto da Barca do Purgatório&quot; (&quot;Act of the Ship of Purgatory&quot;), written in 1518; and &quot;Auto da Barca da Glória&quot; (&quot;Auto of the Ship of Heaven&quot;), written in 1519. These plays combine morality narratives with criticism of 16th-century Portuguese society by placing stereotypical characters on a dock to await the arrival of one of the ships which will take them to their eternal destination. The characters are of a variety of social statuses; for example, in &quot;Auto da Barca do Inferno&quot;, those awaiting passage include a nobleman, a madam, a corrupt judge and prosecutor, a dissolute friar, a dishonest shoemaker, a hanged man, and a Jew (who would have been considered bound for Hell in Vicente&#x27;s time).

His religious lyricism shows the influence of the &quot;Cantigas de Santa Maria&quot; (&quot;Songs of Saint Mary&quot;) and is exemplified in such works as &quot;Auto de Mofina Mendes&quot; (&quot;Act of Mofina Mendes&quot;, literally, in the Portuguese of that time, &quot;Act of Disgrace [Mofina] It Self [Mendes]), &quot;Anunciação&quot; (&quot;Annunciation&quot;), and in the prayer of Saint Augustine in &quot;Auto da Alma&quot; (&quot;Act of the Soul&quot;). For this reason, Vicente is sometimes called the &quot;Poet of the Virgin.&quot;

His other notable religious works include &quot;Auto Pastoril Castelhano&quot; (&quot;Castilian Pastoral Act&quot;) written in 1502; &quot;Auto dos Reis Magos&quot; (&quot;Act of the Magi Kings&quot;) written in 1503 for Christmas celebrations; and &quot;Auto da Sibila Cassandra&quot; (&quot;Act of the Sibyl Cassandra&quot;) written in 1503, a play which announced the Renaissance ideals in Portugal.

===Comedies and farces===
Vicente&#x27;s comedies and farces were likely influenced by indigenous popular entertainment. Contemporaneous Spaniards, like Lucas Fernandez and Torres Naharro, may also have influenced his style.

Vicente&#x27;s comedies blended slapstick and satire; in addition, his use of dialect clearly delineated the social classes of his characters. The staging of these plays maintained the simplicity of morality plays. For example, two simultaneous scenes might utilize a single curtain to divide them.

&quot;Auto da Índia&quot; (&quot;Act of India&quot;), written in 1509, was one of his first comedies. This play, which shows his proficiency with the form, is comparable to a modern bedroom farce. Vicente wrote farces throughout the rest of his life; one notable example is &quot;Farsa de Inês Pereira&quot; (&quot;Farce of Inês Pereira&quot;), written in 1523.

==Influence on Portuguese theatre==
Prior to Vicente, few dramatic stagings had taken place in Portugal. However, a few notable performances had established theatrical precedence in courtly and religious contexts.

During the reign of Sancho I of Portugal (1185–1212), Bonamis and Acompaniado, the first recorded Portuguese actors, put on a show of &quot;arremedillo&quot; and were paid by the King with the donation of lands.

In a document dated 1281, Frei Telo, Archbishop of Braga, refers to liturgical dramas which were performed during Catholic festivities.

In 1451, theatrical acts accompanied the festivities of the wedding of &quot;Infanta&quot; (Princess) Eleanor of Portugal with Emperor Frederick III of Habsburg.

According to the Portuguese chronicles of Fernão Lopes, Gomes Eanes de Zurara, Rui de Pina, and Garcia Resende, spectacular stagings took place in the courts of John I of Portugal, Afonso V of Portugal, and John II of Portugal. For example, Rui de Pina refers to one instance in which King John II himself played the part of The Knight of the Swan in a production which included a scene constructed of fabric waves. During the action, a fleet of carracks with a crew of spectacularly dressed actors entered the room accompanied by the sound of minstrels, trumpets, kettledrum, and artillery.

Other significant Portuguese theatrical works include the eclogues of Bernardim Ribeiro, Cristóvão Falcão, and Sá de Miranda, and the &quot;Pranto de Santa Maria&quot; (1435), an early liturgical drama by André Dias. Garcia de Resende, in his &quot;Cancioneiro Geral&quot;, designates a few other works, such as &quot;Entremez do Anjo&quot; by D. Francisco of Portugal, Count of Vimioso, and the s of Anrique da Mota. Vicente likely assisted in the production of these works, which include comedic scenes.

Though Vicente did not invent Portuguese theatre, his works surpassed any done before that time. His writing in Portuguese and in Spanish shaped both modern Spanish and modern Portuguese drama. His contribution to creating new forms, such as the farce, and raising the morality play to its apotheosis created the base upon which Portuguese and Spanish drama would be built. Though some of his works were later suppressed by the Inquisition, he is now recognized as one of the greatest dramatists of the Renaissance and the leading name in Portuguese theatre. According to Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo, Vicente is &quot;the most important figure of the primitive peninsular playwrights…[There was no one] who surpassed him in Europe in his time.&quot;

==Publication and influence on other works==
The first edition of Vicente&#x27;s complete works was published in Lisbon in 1561–1562 by his children Paula and Luís. In 1586, the second edition was published; however, many parts were heavily censored by the Inquisition. The third edition was not published until 1834 in Hamburg by Barreto Feio, after which Vicente&#x27;s work was finally rediscovered.

Since that time, various composers, such as Max Bruch (who made () from Vicente&#x27;s De la rosa vengo my madre [from the rose I come my mother], which also had a version by Schumann) and Robert Schumann (who made his [Spanish Love Songs] no. 7. from Vicente&#x27;s Sañosa está la nina [Irritated is the little girl] and no. 3. Lied, op. 29 no. 2 from Vicente&#x27;s Canción [Song]; and two of his no. 1. , op. 74 no. 1 and no. 3. Intermezzo, op. 74 no. 2), have set Vicente&#x27;s poetry to music in the form of lieder. Most of these were translated into German by Emanuel van Geibel. Chilean composer Sylvia Soublette set Vicente’s text to music in her song “Del Rosal Vengo.” 

A quote from one of Vicente&#x27;s plays, &quot;The pursuit of love is like falconry&quot;, appears in the epigraph of Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s novel &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot;.

<text>Juan Bautista Vicini Burgos (19 July 1871 – 25 May 1935) was a Dominican political figure. He served as provisional president of the Dominican Republic between 1922 and 1924 during the U.S. military occupation.

==Early life==

Juan Bautista Vicini was born on 19 July 1871 to Italian immigrant Juan Bautista Vicini Cánepa (born &quot;Giovanni Battista Vicini&quot;) and María Burgos Brito. His father arrived to the Dominican Republic during the boom in the sugar industry which he took advantage of to create a respectable operation within a relatively short amount of time. According to the Dutch author H. Hoetink in his book &quot;El Pueblo Dominicano, 1850–1900&quot;, his father owned two sugar plantations by 1882 and by 1893 was the owner of the sugar mill &quot;Angelina&quot;. His friendly relationship with Dictator Ulises Heureaux helped him consolidate a significant fortune. Vicini inherited his father&#x27;s business and was able to become a successful businessman mainly by part of his strict European education. Vicini was fluent in Spanish, Italian, English and French at a very young age.

Juan Bautista Vicini never married and had no wife during his presidency.

==Political career==
The Dominican Republic had been occupied by American Troops since 1916 and after the approval of the Hughes-Peynado plan Vicini was a candidate for the position of provisional President of the Dominican Republic. He was elected President in 1922 and his main goal was to facilitate the evacuation of the United States troops that were present in the Dominican Republic. The day after he was elected, Vicini named the five men who would make up his cabinet. They were as follows:

# José del Carmen Ariza, Secretary of Internal Affairs
# Cayetano Armando Rodríquez, Secretary of Justice and Instruction
# Eladio Sánchez, Secretary of Promotion and Communications
# Manuel Sanabia, Secretary of Health and Charity
# Pedro Pérez, Secretary of Agriculture and Immigration

With these steps, Vicini assured the removal of the North American forces in a peaceful manner. Despite its good intentions, Vicini&#x27;s regime was plagued and pressured by the tight grip of the Hughes-Peynado plan and by the American forces that were still in the country. Even so, he set up the cleanest elections that the Dominican Republic had ever seen in which Horacio Vásquez won on 15 March 1924 against Francisco J. Peynado.

When Vicini left the presidency after the elections, he went back to his sugar business and abandoned politics for the remainder of his life. At the time of his death on 25 May 1935 Juan Bautista Vicini left his relatives one of the largest sugar enterprises in the Caribbean, which is still operating as of 2010.

<text>Harry Franklin Vickers (October 1, 1898 – January 12, 1977) was an American inventor and industrialist. He grew up in Montana and southern California. He was called the &quot;Father of Industrial Hydraulics&quot; by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, who gave him the Society&#x27;s highest award, the ASME Medal, in 1956.

== Early life and influences ==

Vickers was always interested in machinery and mechanics and was a self-taught master machinist. 
He served in World War I in France with the US Army Signal Corps, where he learned about the first generations of electronics and radio. Returning to southern California after the war, he founded Vickers Manufacturing Co., later to be called Vickers Inc.

Initially his company was principally engaged in general mechanical and machining work. The famous author and sportsman Zane Grey once came to his shop to have a large salt water fishing reel repaired. Grey decided that the young Harry Vickers was a man with a future, and offered to arrange for him to be tutored in calculus and other engineering disciplines at night by professors from the University of Southern California.

== Inventions and business development ==

Vickers mechanical ability in combination with his electronic and engineering training formed the basis for his ability to invent, test and manufacture his early hydraulic innovations, which included the first hydraulic power steering system. He went on to invent numerous key components fundamental to the rapid growth of the fluid power industry, including his most famous innovation, the balanced vane pump. Vickers Inc. grew steadily, eventually moving its headquarters to Detroit to be closer to its major automotive and industrial customers.

== Merger with Sperry Corporation ==

With the advent of the depression, Vickers approached Frederick J. Fisher (one of the Fisher Brothers of Fisher Body, the principal supplier of automobile bodies to General Motors) to invest in his company to help it survive. They agreed that Vickers, Inc. would merge with the Sperry Corporation, (of which the Fisher Brothers had principal control) and operate as a subsidiary called Sperry Vickers, with Harry Vickers as president.

== Role in World War II and post-war economy ==

As the start of World War II approached, both Sperry Corp and Sperry Vickers became vital suppliers to the builders of virtually every type of weapon and support system, from aircraft and ships to tanks and transport equipment. At the end of World War II, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, who was Chief of Naval Operations at the start of the war, wrote that, in his view, Harry Vickers had done more than any other civilian to win the war.

Vickers many contributions to his country and global industry placed him in the company of many of the greatest individuals of his era. He was a close friend of Douglas MacArthur, who was the Chairman of the Board of Remington Rand Corporation when Sperry and Remington merged in the early 1950s, forming Sperry Rand. MacArthur continued in that role in the merged company.

== Executive roles ==

Vickers later assumed the Chairman&#x27;s role subsequent to MacArthur&#x27;s retirement. He served as the last president of Sperry Corporation between 1952 and 1955. He then served, in the successory title, as the first president of Sperry Rand Corporation from 1955 to 1965.

He also, during this time, served as the first CEO of Sperry Rand Corporation between 1955 and 1967. He then served as chairman of Sperry Rand Corporation between 1965 and 1967. When he retired in 1967, he was Chairman, President and CEO of the 56th largest company in the United States.

== Personal life ==

Vickers was an amateur radio operator, an active pilot, and an avid golfer, fisherman and hunter. He was married to the former Nell Wilhite, and they had two children: James (1924–1933) and Dawn (1927–1997).

<text>Orville James Victor (October 23, 1827 – March 14, 1910) was an American writer and editor in chief.

==Biography==
Victor was born in Sandusky, Ohio to Henry Clay Victor and Gertrude Nash Victor, and had seven siblings; his father operated a hotel in Sandusky.

He studied in the Norwalk Seminary and graduated in 1847. He decided to pursue writing as a profession and in 1852 was hired as an assistant-editor of the &quot;Sandusky Daily Register.&quot; After marrying Metta Victoria Fuller in 1856, he moved with his wife to New York City where he edited the &quot;Cosmopolitan Art Journal&quot; and other publications. In 1861, Erastus Flavel Beadle recruited him as an editor for the Beadle firm, and Victor worked there for the next thirty-six years. Gilbert Patten wrote, &quot;Mr. Victor taught me much . . . He was a cold-appearing, austere man, but one of the kindest and most helpful editors I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot;

During the American Civil War Victor wrote two books, &quot;History of the Southern Rebellion&quot; and &quot;History of American Conspiracies&quot;. In 1863 he visited England and published a pamphlet there entitled, &quot;The American Rebellion; Its Causes and Objects: Facts for the English People.&quot;

Victor died at his home in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, on March 14, 1910, eighty-three years old.

==Family==
His wife, Metta Victoria Fuller, an author, died in Hohokus Township, New Jersey on June 26, 1886. He did not remarry and grieved her death until the end of the life.

John Harvey Whitson, a contributor to the Beadle&#x27;s dime novel series, described Victor&#x27;s loss in the following words,

==Recognition==
The now-defunct Orvil Township, in Bergen County, New Jersey, was named in his honor in 1885.

Orville James Victor is remembered for his long-time editorial work, from 1861 till 1897, for Beadle publishing company and for his own historical biographies and history books.

<text>Francisco Ramón de Vicuña Larraín (; September 9, 1775 – January 13, 1849) was a Chilean political figure. He served twice as acting President of Chile in 1829. Francisco Vicuña was of Basque descent.

==Early life==
He was born in Santiago on 1775, the son of Francisco de Vicuña Hidalgo y Zavala and of María del Carmen Larraín Salas y Vicuña. He married Mariana de Aguirre, and had 11 children with her.

In 1810, Vicuña participated in Chile&#x27;s war for independence and organized the first firearms production in the country. In 1811, he represented Osorno in the congress, which was to give Chile a constitution, in 1814, he moved to the Senate of Chile. Then, he was arrested for conspiracy against the Spanish crown and banished into exile. Only after Chile&#x27;s victory at the battle of Chacabuco in 1817, was he able to return to his home land. Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins appointed him as a government representative to the northern provinces.

==Political life==
In 1823 he became the head of the administration of Santiago and then as a delegate to the constitutional convention that year. He was one of the main defenders of the Federalist position championed by José Miguel Infante y Rojas. In 1825 the Supreme Director of Chile Ramón Freire appointed him to be his deputy as well as foreign and interior minister and at times acting war, naval, and finance minister.

In 1829, when Francisco Antonio Pinto was elected President of Chile, the runners-up were Francisco Ruiz-Tagle Portales, a liberal federalist, and José Joaquín Prieto Vial, a conservative centralist, who both received the same number of votes. Nonetheless, congress, the majority of which was liberal, declared Joaquín Vicuña Larraín, a distant third and brother of Francisco Ramón (who was president of the senate) Vice President of Chile. The centralists outraged decided for armed resistance and the Chilean Civil War of 1829 broke out.

In the ensuing civil war between the conservative centralists and the liberal federalists, Pinto was forced twice to leave the post of president to Vicuña. First, from July 14 to October 19, when Vicuña assumed as President Delegate, and then finally when he resigned on November 2 and Vicuña assumed power. On December 7, 1829 the conservative troops under José Joaquín Prieto Vial approached Santiago from the South. The government under Vicuña fled northward to Coquimbo, where they were, however, imprisoned by the victorious conservative troops. Then, Chile was without a leader for a few weeks (from December 7 to 24, 1829) until a Government Junta was organized and took control under José Tomás Ovalle.

Under the centralist governments of José Joaquín Prieto Vial and Manuel Bulnes, the liberal Vicuña could not hold any governmental positions. He died in Santiago on January 13, 1849.

<text>Marco Girolamo Vida or Marcus Hieronymus Vida (1485? – September 27, 1566) was an Italian humanist, bishop and important poet in Christian Latin literature.

==Life==
Marco was born at Cremona, then part of the Duchy of Milan. He was the son of the consular (patrician) Guglielmo Vida, and Leona Oscasale. He had two brothers: Giorgio, a captain in the service of the Republic of Venice, and Girolamo, a canon of the cathedral chapter of Cremona. He also had three sisters: Lucia, Elena, and a third whose name is unknown.

He began his studies in Cremona, under the local grammarian, Nicolò Lucari. He was then sent to Mantua, and then Bologna and Padua. It is conjectured that it was in Mantua, where the Canons Regular had a school, that Marco took the habit, perhaps around 1505. By about 1510 he had been granted several benefices: in the diocese of Cremona at Ticengo, then at Monticelli (diocese of Parma), then at Solarolo Monestirolo, where he held the office of provost, and finally at Paderno, where he held the title of archpriest.

Vida joined the court of Pope Leo X and was given the Priory of San Silvestro at Frascati Pope Clement VII appointed him a &quot;Protonotary Apostolic&quot;. He became bishop of Alba on 7 February 1533. In 1544, however, the diocese and the entire marquisate of Monseratto were occupied by the armies of Francis I of France, as part of his long war with the Spanish, and the Bishop was forced to retreat to his benefices in Cremona. Bishop Vida attended the Council of Trent in May and June 1546, and again in March 1547. In 1549 and 1550 he became involved in a controversy between his native Cremona and the city of Pavia, helping to prepare the brief for his fellow citizens to be argued before the Spanish governor of Milan, Ferrante Gonzaga. The written defense was published as the &quot;Cremonensium Orationes III&quot; of clear Ciceronian influence.

On 29 March 1564 Bishop Vida wrote his last will and testament. He died on 27 September 1566.

==Works==

Vida wrote a considerable amount of Renaissance Latin poetry, both secular and sacred, in classical style, particular the style of Virgil. Among his best-known works are the didactic poem in three books, &quot;De arte poetica&quot; (On the Art of Poetry), partly inspired by Horace, and &quot;Scacchia Ludus&quot; (&quot;The Game of Chess&quot;). Both poems, after circulating in manuscript and seeing unauthprised publications, were first published in 1527.

According to H.J.R. Murray, Vida&#x27;s poem about Chess, &quot;attained a great popularity in the 16th c.: it was repeatedly printed, and translations or imitations exist in most of the European languages.&quot;

Murray continues, &quot;In the opening lines, Vida tells how he has written this poem, on a subject never before attempted by the poets, at the insistence of Federigo Fregoso, and he expresses the hope that it might afford some relaxation to Guiliano de Medici in the heavy task which he and his brother (Giovanni, later Pope Leo X, a keen chess-player), had undertaken in repelling the French invaders of Italy. V.d. Lasa has shown that the allusions to Italian events point definitively to the early summer of 1513 as the date of the poem. Vida was then aged twenty-three. The aim of the poem is to describe in Virgilian Latin a game of chess played between Apollo and Mercury in the presence of the other gods. Vida apparently experienced some difficulty in deciding on a suitable classical nomenclature for the Bishop and Rook. In the earlier version the Bishops are represented as centaurs with bows and arrows; in later version the Centaurs have disappeared and the Bishop is an Archer. In the earlier version the Rooks are represented as Cyclops... In the later version the Rooks appear as warring towers borne upon the backs of elephants... Elsewhere in the poem the name &quot;Elephas&quot; is used, generally, however, with an allusion to the tower it is supposed to carry on its back... The extraordinary thing is that Vida&#x27;s choice of names should have caught the popular fancy. All three terms - &quot;Archer&quot; for the Bishop, &quot;Elephant&quot; and &quot;Tower (Castle)&quot; for the Rook - were adopted by players in different parts of Western Europe. Even the term &quot;Amazon&quot;, which he used for the Queen, was tried by the writers of chess books.&quot;

His major work was the Latin epic poem &quot;Christiados libri sex&quot; (&quot;The Christiad in Six Books&quot;), an epic poem about the Life of Christ in the style and the literary language of Virgil.

He began work on &quot;The Christiad&quot; at the request of Pope Leo X, who was elected in the 1513 Conclave, but Vida did not complete it until the early 1530s. It was published in 1535, well after the pope&#x27;s death on 1 December 1521.

According to Watson Kirkconnell, the &quot;Christiad&quot;, &quot;was one of the most famous poems of the Early Renaissance&quot;. Furthermore, according to Kirkconnell, Vida&#x27;s, &quot;description of the Council in Hell, addressed by Lucifer, in Book I&quot;, was, &quot;a feature later to be copied&quot;, by Torquato Tasso, Abraham Cowley, and by John Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The standard English translations, which render Vida&#x27;s poem into heroic couplets, were published by John Cranwell in 1768 and by Edward Granan in 1771.

<text>Consumer behaviour is the study of individuals, groups, or organisations and all activities associated with the purchase, use and disposal of goods and services. It encompasses how the consumer&#x27;s emotions, attitudes, and preferences affect buying behaviour. Consumer behaviour emerged in the 1940–1950s as a distinct sub-discipline of marketing, but has become an interdisciplinary social science that blends elements from psychology, sociology, social anthropology, anthropology, ethnography, ethnology, marketing, and economics (especially behavioural economics).

The study of consumer behaviour formally investigates individual qualities such as demographics, personality lifestyles, and behavioural variables (like usage rates, usage occasion, loyalty, brand advocacy, and willingness to provide referrals), in an attempt to understand people&#x27;s wants and consumption patterns. Consumer behaviour also investigates on the influences on the consumer, from social groups such as family, friends, sports, and reference groups, to society in general (brand-influencers, opinion leaders).

Due to the unpredictability of consumer behavior, marketers and researchers use ethnography, consumer neuroscience, and machine learning, along with customer relationship management (CRM) databases, to analyze customer patterns. The extensive data from these databases allows for a detailed examination of factors influencing customer loyalty, re-purchase intentions, and other behaviors like providing referrals and becoming brand advocates. Additionally, these databases aid in market segmentation, particularly behavioral segmentation, enabling the creation of highly targeted and personalized marketing strategies. 

== Origins of consumer behaviour ==
In the 1940s and 1950s, marketing was dominated by the so-called &quot;classical schools of thought&quot; which were highly descriptive and relied heavily on case study approaches with only occasional use of interview methods. At the end of the 1950s, two important reports criticised marketing for its lack of methodological rigor, especially the failure to adopt mathematically-oriented behavioural science research methods. The stage was set for marketing to become more inter-disciplinary by adopting a consumer-behaviourist perspective.

From the 1950s, marketing began to shift its reliance away from economics and towards other disciplines, notably the behavioural sciences, including sociology, anthropology, and clinical psychology. This resulted in a new emphasis on the customer as a unit of analysis. As a result, new substantive knowledge was added to the marketing discipline – including such ideas as opinion leadership, reference groups, and brand loyalty. Market segmentation, especially demographic segmentation based on socioeconomic status (SES) index and household life-cycle, also became fashionable. With the addition of consumer behaviour, the marketing discipline exhibited increasing scientific sophistication with respect to theory development and testing procedures.

In its early years, consumer behaviour was heavily influenced by motivation research, which had increased the understanding of customers, and had been used extensively by consultants in the advertising industry and also within the discipline of psychology in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. By the 1950s, marketing began to adopt techniques used by motivation researchers including depth interviews, projective techniques, thematic apperception tests, and a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods. More recently, scholars have added a new set of tools including ethnography, photo-elicitation techniques, and phenomenological interviewing. In addition to these, contemporary research has delved further into the complexities of consumer behavior, incorporating innovative approaches such as neuroimaging studies and big data analytics. These modern tools provide deeper insights into subconscious consumer motivations and decision-making processes. Today, consumer behaviour (or &quot;CB&quot; as it is affectionately known) is regarded as an important sub-discipline within marketing and is included as a unit of study in almost all undergraduate marketing programs.

== Definition and explanation ==
Consumer behaviour means entails &quot;all activities associated with the purchase, use and disposal of goods and services, including the consumer&#x27;s emotional, mental and behavioural responses that precede or follow these activities.&quot; The term consumer can refer to individual consumers as well as organisational consumers, and more specifically, &quot;an end user, and not necessarily a purchaser, in the distribution chain of a good or service.&quot; Consumer behaviour is concerned with:
* &quot;purchase activities&quot;: the purchase of goods or services; how consumers acquire products and services, and all the activities leading up to a purchase decision, including information search, evaluating goods and services, and payment methods including the purchase experience
* &quot;use or consumption activities&quot;: concerns the who, where, when, and how of consumption and the usage experience, including the symbolic associations and the way that goods are distributed within families or consumption units
* &quot;disposal activities&quot;: concerns the way that consumers dispose of products and packaging; may also include reselling activities such as eBay and second-hand markets

Consumer responses may be:
* &quot;emotional (or affective)&quot; responses: refer to emotions such as feelings or moods,
* &quot;mental (or cognitive&quot;) responses: refer to the consumer&#x27;s thought processes, their
* &quot;behavioural (or conative) responses:&quot; refer to the consumer&#x27;s observable responses in relation to the purchase and disposal of goods or services.

According to the American Marketing Association, consumer behaviour can be defined as &quot;the dynamic interaction of affect and cognition, behaviour, and environmental events by which human beings conduct the exchange aspects of their lives.&quot;

As a field of study, consumer behaviour is an applied social science. Consumer behaviour analysis is the &quot;use of behaviour principles, usually gained experimentally, to interpret human economic consumption.&quot; As a discipline, consumer behaviour stands at the intersection of economic psychology and marketing science.

== The purchase decision and its context ==
Understanding purchase and consumption behaviour is a key challenge for marketers. Consumer behaviour, in its broadest sense, is concerned with understanding both how purchase decisions are made and how products or services are consumed or experienced. Consumers are active decision-makers. They decide what to purchase, often based on their disposable income or budget. They may change their preferences related to their budget and a range of other factors.

Some purchase decisions involve long, detailed processes that include extensive information search to select between competing alternatives. Other purchase decisions, consumers must make highly complex decisions, often based on a lack of time, knowledge or negotiating ability. Such as impulse buys or habitual purchases, are made almost instantaneously with little or no investment of time or effort in information search.

Some purchase decisions are made by groups (such as families, households or businesses) while others are made by individuals. When a purchase decision is made by a small group, such as a household, different members of the group may become involved at different stages of the decision process and may perform different roles. For example, one person may suggest the purchase category, another may search for product-related information while yet another may physically go to the store, buy the product, and transport it home. It is customary to think about the types of decision roles; such as:

;The Initiator: the person who proposes a brand (or product) for consideration (something in return);
;The Influencer: someone who recommends a given brand;
;The Decider: the person who makes the ultimate purchase decision;
;The Purchaser: the one who orders or physically buys it;
;The User: the person who uses or consumes the product.

For most purchase decisions, each of the decision roles must be performed, but not always by the same individual. For example, in the case of family making a decision about a dining-out venue, a parent may initiate the process by intimating that they are too tired to cook. The children are important influencers in the overall purchase decision, but both parents may act as joint deciders performing a gate-keeping role by vetoing unacceptable alternatives and encouraging more acceptable alternatives. The importance of children as influencers in a wide range of purchase contexts should never be underestimated and the phenomenon is known as pester power.

To approach the mental processes used in purchasing decisions, some authors employ the concept of the black box, which represents the cognitive and affective processes used by a consumer during a purchase decision. The decision model situates the black box in a broader environment which shows the interaction of external and internal stimuli (e.g. consumer characteristics, situational factors, marketing influences, and environmental factors) as well as consumer responses. The black box model is related to the black box theory of behaviourism, where the focus extends beyond processes occurring &quot;inside&quot; the consumer and also includes the &quot;relation&quot; between the stimuli and the consumer&#x27;s response.

The decision model assumes that purchase decisions do not occur in a vacuum. Rather, they occur in real time and are affected by other stimuli, including external environmental stimuli and the consumer&#x27;s momentary situation. The elements of the model include interpersonal stimuli (between people) or intrapersonal stimuli (within people), environmental stimuli and marketing stimuli. Marketing stimuli include actions planned and carried out by companies, whereas environmental stimuli include actions or events occurring in the wider operating environment and include social, economic, political, and cultural dimensions. In addition, the buyer&#x27;s black box includes buyer characteristics and the decision process, which influence the buyer&#x27;s responses.

=== Problem recognition ===
The first stage of the purchase decision process begins with &quot;problem recognition&quot; (also known as category need or need arousal). This is when the consumer identifies a need, typically defined as the difference between the consumer&#x27;s current state and their desired or ideal state. A simpler way of thinking about problem recognition is that it is where the consumer decides that they are &#x27;in the market&#x27; for a product or service to satisfy some need or want. The strength of the underlying need drives the entire decision process.

Theorists identify three broad classes of problem-solving situation relevant for the purchase decision:

;Extensive problem-solving: Purchases that warrant greater deliberation, more extensive information search and evaluation of alternatives. These are typically expensive purchases, or purchases with high social visibility e.g. fashion, cars.
;Limited problem-solving: Known or familiar purchases, regular purchases, straight re-buys. Typically low-priced items.
;Routinised problem-solving: Repeat purchases or habitual purchases

Consumers become aware of a problem in a variety of ways including:

;Out-of-Stock/ Natural Depletion: When a consumer needs to replenish stocks of a consumable item e.g. ran out of milk or bread.
;Regular purchase: When a consumer purchases a product on a regular basis e.g. newspaper, magazines.
;Dissatisfaction: When a consumer is not satisfied with the current product or service.
;New Needs or Wants: Lifestyle changes may trigger the identification of new needs e.g. the arrival of a baby may prompt the purchase of a cot, stroller, and car-seat for the baby.
;Related products: The purchase of one product may trigger the need for accessories, spare parts, or complementary goods and services e.g. the purchase of a printer leads to the need for ink cartridges; the purchase of a digital camera leads to the need for memory cards.
;Marketer-induced problem recognition: When marketing activity persuades consumers of a problem (usually a problem that the consumer did not realise they had). The consciously, and subconsciously, consumed content in traditional as well as social media greatly plays the role of a stimulus for the consumer&#x27;s recognition of a new need.
;New Products or Categories: When consumers become aware of new innovative products that offer a superior means of fulfilling a need. Disruptive technologies such as the advent of wireless-free communications devices can trigger a need for plethora of products such as a new mouse or printer.

=== Information search ===
During the information search and evaluation stages, the consumer works through processes designed to arrive at a number of brands (or products) that represent viable purchase alternatives. Typically consumers first carry out an internal search and scan their memory for suitable brands. The evoked set is the set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory and is typically a very small set of some 3- 5 alternatives. Consumers may choose to supplement the number of brands in the evoked set by carrying out an &quot;external search&quot; using sources such as the Internet, manufacturer/brand websites, shopping around, product reviews, referrals from peers and the like. The readiness of information availability has raised the informedness of the consumers: the degree to which they know what is available in the marketplace, with precisely which attributes, and at precisely what price.

The fact that a consumer is aware of a brand does not necessarily mean that it is being considered as a potential purchase. For instance, the consumer may be aware of certain brands, but not favourably disposed towards them (known as the &quot;inept set&quot;). Such brands will typically be excluded from further evaluation as purchase options. For other brands, the consumer may have indifferent feelings (the &quot;inert set&quot;). As the consumer approaches the actual purchase, they distill the mental list of brands into a set of alternatives that represent realistic purchase options, known as the &quot;consideration set&quot;. By definition, the consideration set refers to the &quot;small set of brands which a consumer pays close attention to when making a purchase decision&quot;. This ultimately leads to a &quot;choice set&quot; which includes the alternatives that are strong contenders for purchase.

Specific brand names enter the consumer&#x27;s consideration set based on the extent to which they satisfy the consumer&#x27;s purchasing objectives and/or the salience or accessibility of the brand at the time of making the purchase decision. By implication, brand names that are more memorable are more likely to be accessible. Traditionally, one of the main roles of advertising and promotion was to increase the likelihood that a brand name was included in the consumer&#x27;s evoked set. Repeated exposure to brand names through intensive advertising was the primary method for increasing &quot;top-of-mind brand awareness&quot;. However, the advent of the Internet means that consumers can obtain brand/product information from a multiplicity of different platforms. In practice, the consideration set has assumed greater importance in the purchase decision process because consumers are no longer totally reliant on memory. This is marketing, which could be defined as &quot;the process by which companies create value for customers and build strong customer relationships, in order to capture value from customers in return.&quot; This definition strongly implies that the relationship is built upon an exchange and the &quot;creation&quot; of value. This means that a need is built for a consumer, with the product presented or advertised to them through an analytical study of the user&#x27;s patterns of consumption and their behaviours and habits. The implication for marketers is that relevant brand information should be disseminated as widely as possible and included on any forum where consumers are likely to search for product or brand information, whether traditional media or digital media channels. Thus, marketers require a rich understanding of the typical consumer&#x27;s touchpoints.

=== Evaluation of alternatives ===
Consumer evaluation can be viewed as a distinct stage. Alternatively, evaluation may occur continuously throughout the entire decision process. Consumers evaluate alternatives in terms of the functional (also called &quot;utilitarian&quot;) and psycho-social (also called the &quot;value-expressive&quot; or the &quot;symbolic&quot;) benefits offered.
* &quot;Functional benefits&quot; are the tangible outcomes that can be experienced by the consumer such as taste or physical appearance.
* &quot;Psycho-social benefits&quot; are the more abstract outcomes or the personality-related attributes of a brand, such as the social currency that might accrue from wearing an expensive suit or designer label or driving a &#x27;hot&#x27; car.

Brand image (or brand personality) is an important psycho-social attribute. Consumers can have both positive and negative beliefs about a given brand. A considerable body of research suggests that consumers are predisposed towards brands with a personality that matches their own and that a good match can affect brand preference, brand choice, satisfaction with a brand, brand commitment and loyalty, and the consumer&#x27;s propensity to give positive word-of-mouth referrals. The branch of consumer behaviour that investigates the matching of a brand&#x27;s personality and the consumer&#x27;s personality is known as &quot;self-congruity research.&quot; The social media presence of a brand plays a huge part in this stage, with the effect described as &quot;Think of regular media as a one-way street where you can read a newspaper or listen to a report on television, but you have very limited ability to give your thoughts on the matter. Social media, on the other hand, is a two-way street that gives you the ability to communicate too.&quot; Consumer beliefs about a brand or product category may vary depending on a range of factors including the consumer&#x27;s prior experience and the effects of selective perception, distortion, and retention. Consumers who are less knowledgeble about a category tend to evaluate a brand based on its functional characteristics. However, when consumers become more knowledgeable, functional attributes diminish and consumers process more abstract information about the brand, notably the self-related aspects.

The marketing organisation needs a deep understanding of the benefits most valued by consumers and therefore which attributes are most important in terms of the consumer&#x27;s purchase decision. It also needs to monitor other brands in the customer&#x27;s consideration set to optimise planning for its own brand. During the evaluation of alternatives, the consumer ranks or assesses the relative merits of different options available. No universal evaluation process is used by consumers across all-buying situations. Instead, consumers generate different evaluation criteria depending on each unique buying situation. Social media further enables consumers to share views with their peers about the product they are looking to purchase. This way, consumers can gauge the positive and negative sides of each alternative, and decide even more conveniently as for the best product to buy. Thus the relevant evaluation attributes vary according to across different types of consumers and purchase contexts. For example, attributes important for evaluating a restaurant would include food quality, price, location, atmosphere, quality of service, and menu selection. Consumers, depending on their geographic, demographic, psychographic and behavioural characteristics, will decide which attributes are important to them. Potential patrons seeking a pleasant dining experience may be willing to travel further distances to patronise a fine-dining venue compared to those wanting a quick meal at a more utilitarian eatery. After evaluating the different product attributes, the consumer ranks each attribute or benefit from highly important to least important. These priorities are directly related to the consumer&#x27;s needs and wants. Thus, the consumer arrives at a weighted score for each product or brand which represents the consumer&#x27;s subjective assessment of individual attribute scores weighted in terms of their importance. Using these scores, they arrive at a total mental score or rank for each product/brand under consideration.

===Purchase decision===
Once the alternatives have been evaluated, the consumer firms up their resolve to proceed through to the actual purchase. For example, the consumer might say to themself, &quot;Yes, I will buy Brand X one day.&quot; This self instruction to make a purchase is known as &quot;purchase intent.&quot; Purchase intentions are a strong yet imperfect predictor of sales. Sometimes purchase intentions simply do not translate into an actual purchase and this can signal a marketing problem. For instance, a consumer may wish to buy a new product, but may be unaware of the retail outlets that stock it, so that purchase cannot proceed. The extent to which purchase intentions result in actual sales is known as the &quot;sales conversion&quot; rate.

Organisations use a variety of techniques to improve conversion rates. The provision of easy credit or payment terms may encourage purchase. Sales promotions such as the opportunity to receive a premium or enter a competition may provide an incentive to buy now rather than defer purchases for a later date. Advertising messages with a strong &quot;call-to-action&quot; are yet another device used to convert customers. A call-to-action is any device designed to encourage immediate sale. Typically, a call-to-action includes specific wording in an advertisement or selling pitch that employs imperative verbs such as &quot;Buy now!&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t wait!&quot;. Other types of calls-to-action might provide consumers with strong reasons for purchasing immediately such an offer that is only available for a limited time (e.g. &#x27;Offer must expire soon&#x27;; &#x27;Limited stocks available&#x27;) or a special deal usually accompanied by a time constraint (e.g. &#x27;Order before midnight to receive a free gift with your order&#x27;; &#x27;Two for the price of one for the first 50 callers only&#x27;). Additionally, service convenience is a saving of effort, in the way that it minimises the activities that customers may bear to buy goods and services. The key to a powerful call-to-action is to provide consumers with compelling reasons to purchase promptly rather than defer purchase decisions.

As consumers approach the actual purchase decision, they are more likely to rely on personal sources of information. For this reason, personal sales representatives must be well versed in giving sales pitches and in tactics used to close the sale. Methods used might include &#x27;social evidence&#x27;, where the salesperson refers to previous success and satisfaction from other customers buying the product. &#x27;Scarcity attraction&#x27; is another technique, where the salesperson mentions that the offer is limited, as it forces the consumer to make a quicker decision and therefore spend less time evaluating alternatives.

=== Post-purchase evaluation ===
Following purchase and after experiencing the product or service, the consumer enters the final stage, namely post-purchase evaluation. Foxall suggested that post-purchase evaluation can provide key feedback to marketers because it influences future purchase patterns and consumption activities.

The post purchase stage is where the consumer examines and compares product features, such as price, functionality, and quality with their expectations. Post purchase evaluation can be viewed as the steps taken by consumers to correlate their expectations with perceived value and thus influence their next purchase decision for that good or service. For example, if a consumer buys a new phone and their post-purchase evaluation is positive, they will be encouraged to purchase the same brand or from the same company in the future. This is also known as &quot;post-purchase intention&quot;. On the contrary, if a consumer is dissatisfied with the new phone, they may take actions to resolve the dissatisfaction. Consumer actions, in this instance, could involve requesting a refund, making a complaint, deciding not to purchase the same brand or from the same company in the future, or even spreading negative product reviews to friends or acquaintances, possibly via social media.

After acquisition, consumption, or disposition, consumers may feel some uncertainty in regards to the decision made, generating in some cases regret. Post-decision dissonance (also known as cognitive dissonance) is the feeling of anxiety that occurs in the post purchase stage, as well as the uneasy feelings or concerns as to whether or not the correct decision was made at purchase. Some consumers, for instance, may regret that they did not purchase one of the other brands they were considering. This type of anxiety can affect consumers&#x27; subsequent behaviour and may have implications for repeat patronage and customer loyalty.

Consumers use a number of strategies to reduce post purchase dissonance. A typical strategy is to look to peers or significant others for validation of the purchase choice. Customers have always been led by the opinions of friends and family, but nowadays this is corroborated by social media likes, reviews, and testimonials. Marketing communications can also be used to remind consumers that they made a wise choice by purchasing Brand X.

When consumers make unfavorable comparisons between the chosen option and the options forgone, they may feel post-decision regret or buyer&#x27;s remorse. Consumers can also feel short-term regret when they avoid making a purchase decision, however this regret can dissipate over time. Through their experiences consumers can learn and also engage in a process called &quot;hypothesis testing&quot;. This refers to the formation of hypotheses about the products or a service through prior experience or word of mouth communications. There are four stages that consumers go through in the hypothesis testing: Hypothesis generation, exposure of evidence, encoding of evidence, and integration of evidence.

==Influences on purchase decision==
Purchasing is influenced by a wide range of internal and external factors.

=== Consumer awareness ===
&quot;Consumer awareness&quot; refers to the awareness of the consumption of goods bought by consumers in the long-term shopping environment and purchasing activities.

The change of life concept is the subjective factor of the change of consumer awareness. As people&#x27;s living standards and incomes continue to increase, people&#x27;s life concepts are constantly changing. Differences in consumer personality are the internal motivations for changes in consumer awareness.

Intensified market competition is a catalyst for changes in consumer awareness. Many companies have launched their own branded products in order to gain a foothold in an increasingly competitive market. In the face of a variety of goods and brands, consumers&#x27; brand awareness matures. When people buy goods, paying attention to the brand has become a fashion. Faced with the severe competition situation, companies began to realize the importance of implementing brand strategy, and began to focus on market research, and on this basis, deeply grasp the consumer&#x27;s psychological pulse to improve market share and brand loyalty.
With the change of people&#x27;s life concept, consumers&#x27; rational consumption psychology has become increasingly prominent. Social Marketing, Customised Marketing, brand-name shopping, and the consumer&#x27;s perception of the price of the commodity (directly expressed as the consumer&#x27;s sensitivity to price) are all main factors for understanding consumer attitudes, and help explain the reaction of market demand to price changes.

=== Internal influences on purchase decision ===
Internal influences refer to both personal and interpersonal factors. Social theory suggests that individuals have both a &quot;personal identity&quot; and a &quot;social identity&quot;. Personal identity consists of unique personal characteristics such as skills and capabilities, interests, and hobbies. Social identity consists of the individual&#x27;s perception of the central groups to which an individual belongs and may refer to an age group, a lifestyle group, religious group, educational group, or some other reference group. Social psychologists have established that the need to belong is one of the fundamental human needs. Purchasing behaviour is therefore influenced by a broad range of internal factors such as psychological, socio-economic, demographic and personality factors. Demographic factors include income level, psychographics (lifestyles), age, occupation, and socioeconomic status. Personality factors include knowledge, attitudes, personal values, beliefs, emotions, and feelings. Psychological factors include an individual&#x27;s motivation, attitudes, personal values, and beliefs. Social identity factors include culture, sub-culture, and reference groups. Other factors that may affect the purchase decision include the environment and the consumer&#x27;s prior experience with the category or brand.

====Motivations and emotions====
The consumer&#x27;s underlying motivation drives consumer action, including the information search and purchase decision. The consumer&#x27;s attitude to a brand (or brand preference) is described as a link between the brand and a purchase motivation. These motivations may be negative (to avoid pain or unpleasantness) or positive (to achieve some type of reward such as sensory gratification).

One approach to understanding motivations was developed by Abraham Maslow. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs is based on five levels of needs, organised accordingly to the level of importance.

Maslow&#x27;s five needs are:
;Physiological: basic levels of needs such as food, water, and sleep
;Safety: the need for physical safety, shelter, and security
;Belonging: the need for love, friendship, and also a desire for group acceptance
;Esteem: The need for status, recognition, and self-respect
;Self-actualisation: The desire for self-fulfillment (e.g. personal growth, artistic expression)

Physiological needs and safety needs are the so-called lower order needs. Consumers typically use most of their resources (time, energy, and finances) attempting to satisfy these lower order needs before the higher order needs of belonging, esteem, and self-actualisation become meaningful. Part of any marketing program requires an understanding of which motives drive given product choices. Marketing communications can illustrate how a product or brand fulfills these needs. Maslow&#x27;s approach is a generalised model for understanding human motivations in a wide variety of contexts, but is not specific to purchasing decisions.

Another approach proposes eight &quot;purchase&quot; motivations, five negative motives and three positive motives, which energise purchase decisions as illustrated in the table below. These motivations are believed to provide positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement.

In the marketing literature, the consumer&#x27;s motivation to search for information and engage in the purchase decision process is sometimes known as &quot;involvement&quot;. Consumer involvement has been defined as &quot;the personal relevance or importance of a message [or a decision]&quot;. Purchase decisions are classified as low involvement when consumers experience only a small psycho-social loss in the event that they make a poor decision. On the other hand, a purchase decision is classified as high involvement when psycho-social risks are perceived to be relatively high. The consumer&#x27;s level of involvement is dependent on a number of factors including perceived risk of negative consequences in the event of a poor decision, the social visibility of the product, and the consumer&#x27;s prior experience with the product category.

====Perception====
Part of marketing strategy is to ascertain how consumers gain knowledge and use information from external sources. The perception process is where individuals receive, organise, and interpret information in order to attribute some meaning. Perception involves three distinct processes: sensing information, selecting information, and interpreting information. Sensation is also part of the perception process, and it is linked direct with responses from the senses creating some reaction towards the brand name, advertising, and packaging. The process of perception is uniquely individual and may depend on a combination of internal and external factors such as experiences, expectations, needs, and the momentary set.

When exposed to a stimulus, consumers may respond in entirely different ways due to individual perceptual processes. A number of processes potentially support or interfere with perception. &quot;Selective exposure&quot; occurs when consumers decide whether to be exposed to information inputs. &quot;Selective attention&quot; occurs when consumers focus on some messages to the exclusion of others. &quot;Selective comprehension&quot; is where the consumer interprets information in a manner that is consistent with their own beliefs. &quot;Selective retention&quot; occurs when consumers remember some information while rapidly forgetting other information. Collectively the processes of selective exposure, attention, comprehension, and retention lead individual consumers to favor certain messages over others. The way that consumers combine information inputs to arrive at a purchase decision is known as &quot;integration&quot;.

Marketers are interested in consumer perceptions of brands, packaging, product formulations, labeling, and pricing. Of special interest is the &quot;threshold of perception&quot; (also known as the &quot;just noticeable difference&quot;) in a stimulus. For example, how much should a marketer lower a price before consumers recognise it as a bargain? In addition, marketers planning to enter global markets need to be aware of cultural differences in perception. For example, westerners associate the colour white with purity, cleanliness, and hygiene, but in eastern countries white is often associated with mourning and death. Accordingly, white packaging would be an inappropriate colour choice for food labels on products to be marketed in Asia.

==== Symbolic Consumer Behaviour ====
Symbolic consumption becomes the internal influence of consumer behaviour and forms a special symbol. Consumption symbols can be used to explain the consumer as a group member or a unique individual. Consumer consumption behaviour is not only material and psychological consumption.
Symbolic consumption has two meanings:
1. A symbol of consumption. Consumption expresses and transmits a certain meaning and message. The meaning derived from culture enables us to use products to symbolise our membership in various social groups. This symbolic consumption is the process of social expression and social communication.
2. Symbolic consumption: People consume not only the commodities themselves but also certain cultural and social significance symbolised or represented by them, including mood, beauty, grade, status, status, atmosphere, style, emotional appeal, etc. Symbolic consumption is typically reflected in brand consumption. Brand has three functions for consumers: functional value, symbolic value and experience value. Take luxury brands: The power of luxury brands is more than just their ability to convey identity. Some consumers want to make an impression. Luxury goods used to be the daily routine of the aristocracy, but after the concept of modern social class was blurred, consumers still regarded it as a ticket to enter the upper class. Consumers evaluate a brand based on how it aligns with our identity, which helps define and maintain our self-concept. As a symbol of noble status, wealth and success, it has become a consumer identity and status symbol.

==== Prior experience ====
The consumer&#x27;s prior experience with the category, product, or brand can have a major bearing on purchase decision-making. Experienced consumers (also called experts) are more sophisticated consumers; they tend to be more skillful information searchers, canvass a broader range of information sources, and use complex heuristics to evaluate purchase options. Novice consumers, on the other hand, are less efficient information searchers and tend to perceive higher levels of purchase risk on account of their unfamiliarity with the brand or category. When consumers have prior experience, they have less motivation to search for information and spend less effort on information search but can process new information more efficiently. One study, for example, found that as consumer experience increases, consumers consider a wider range of purchase alternatives (that is, they generate a larger consideration set, but only at the product category level).

==== Random factor ====
Random factors refer to special occasions and a series of random conditions consumers have when purchasing. Sometimes, consumer purchase decisions are made in unexpected circumstances, or a situation will delay or shorten people&#x27;s decision-making process. Research has found that in waiting for scenarios where consumers are ubiquitous, seemingly unrelated physical cues, such as area carpets or queue guidelines, can act as virtual boundaries that alter consumers&#x27; initial decisions.

===External influences on purchase decision===

Purchasing behaviour can also be affected by external influences, such as culture, sub-culture, social class, reference groups, family, and situational determinants.

====Culture====

Culture is the broadest and most abstract of the external factors. Culture refers to the complexity of learning meanings, values, norms, and customs shared by members of a society. Cultural norms are relatively stable over time, so culture has a major effect on consumer behaviour. Research studies have consistently shown that culture influences almost every aspect of purchasing: it affects basic psychological domains such as self-identity and motivation, the way that information is processed, and the way that advertising messages are interpreted. Additionally, perceived value and happiness are critical in shaping consumers&#x27; attitudes and behavioral intentions. 

The cultural choice of consumption behaviour, the decisive external factor - the overall social and cultural atmosphere- and the decisive internal factor - the consumer&#x27;s artistic quality, aesthetic pursuit, and cultural value orientation. The cultural choice of consumption must be restricted by two decisive factors inside and outside. The so-called social and cultural atmosphere is embodied in the influence of consumption atmosphere, customs and trends on consumers. For example, all kinds of money-worship consumption criticised by public opinion are the influence of vulgar culture. The so-called internal factors mainly refer to what kind of spiritual realm and value orientation consumers treat consumption, and what they show through consumption is some cultural mentality.

Marketers interested in global expansion are especially interested in understanding cross-cultural differences in purchasing and consumption. For instance, Ferrari, one of the world&#x27;s top brands found that Chinese consumers are very different from their Western counterparts. Whereas consumers in the US, UK and Australia expect to wait 12 months for a custom-made Ferrari, prospective Chinese buyers want to drive the vehicle off the showroom floor. China is an &#x27;instant-gratification market&#x27;. Buyers see their friends riding around in a luxury car and want to have the same as quickly as possible. To meet the growing demand for luxury goods, Ferrari and other luxury car makers have been forced to modify their production processes for Asian markets.

====Subcultures====
Subcultures may be based on age, geographic, religious, racial, and ethnic differences. More often, however, a subculture occurs when people with shared interests form a loose-knit group with a distinctive identity (sometimes called &quot;consumer tribes&quot;). Members of subcultures are self-selected, and signal their membership status by adopting symbols, rituals, or behaviours that are widely understood by other members of the tribe (e.g. a dress code, hairstyle or even a unique way of speaking). For example, within youth culture it is possible to identify a number of sub-groups with common interests such as skaters and bladers, surfers, ravers, punks, skin-heads, Goths, homies, and others. Generally known as communities, as they create a sense of belonging to something important.

A different type of subculture is a &quot;consumption subculture&quot; which is based on a shared commitment to a common brand or product. In other words, consumption subcultures cut across demographic, geographic, and social boundaries. The most well-known example of a consumption subculture is that of Harley-Davidson motorcycle owners. Ethnographic researchers who have studied Harley riders believe that there are only two types of motor cyclists: Harley owners and the rest. Harley-Davidson has leveraged the values of this subculture by establishing the Harley Owners Group (HOG).

Subcultures are important to marketers for several reasons. Firstly, given that subcultures can represent sizeable market segments which are profitable and influential, there are obvious advantages in developing and selling products and services that meet the needs of subculture members. Secondly, and perhaps less obviously, many new fads and fashions emerge spontaneously from within these tribal groups. Trend-spotters are accordingly interested in studying the lifestyles and activities of tribes in an effort to spot new trends before they go mainstream.

====Social class====
Social class refers to relatively homogenous divisions in a society, typically based on socio-economic variables such as educational attainment, income, and occupation. Social class can be very difficult to define and measure, however marketers around the world tend to use a conventional classification which divides any given population into five socio-economic quintiles (e.g. In Australia the groups AB, C, D, E and FG, where AB is the top socio-economic quintile, but in much of Asia the quintiles are labelled I, II, III, IV and V where I is the top quintile). In Australia, for example, the AB socio-economic group account for just 24% of the population, but control 50% of discretionary spending. The top quintiles (i.e. AB socio-economic segments) are of particular interest to marketers of luxury goods and services such as travel, dining-out, entertainment, luxury cars, investment or wealth management services, up-market consumer electronics, and designer labels (e.g. Louis Vuitton). However, middle-class consumers tend to consume more carefully in comparison and collect information to compare different producers in the same line. Those who are lower-class consumers tend to buy more on impulse in comparison to the wealthy class who purchases goods to maintain social status.

====Reference groups====
A reference group is defined as &quot;a group whose presumed perspectives or values are being used by an individual as the basis for his or her judgment, opinions, and actions&quot;. Reference groups are important because they are used to guide an individual&#x27;s attitudes, beliefs and values. Insights into how consumers acquire a given value system can be obtained from an understanding of group influence and group socialisation processes.

The literature identifies five broad types of reference group: primary, secondary, aspirational, dissociative and formal:
: &quot;Primary groups&quot;: groups, such as family, that exert a strong influence on attitudes and behaviours
: &quot;Secondary groups&quot;: groups such as clubs, societies, sports teams, political parties, religions that align with a person&#x27;s ideas or values, but exert a less fundamental influence on the formation of attitudes and behaviours
: &quot;Aspirational groups&quot; groups to which an individual does not currently belong, but possibly aspires to become a member because the group possesses characteristics which are admired.
: &quot;Disassociative reference groups&quot; - a group which has a negative image; individuals may disapprove of the disassociative group&#x27;s values, attitudes or behaviours and may seek to distance themselves from such groups.

&quot;Opinion Leaders&quot; can act like reference groups in that they exert considerable social influence because of their product knowledge, expertise and credibility. In the marketing literature, opinion leaders are also known as influencers, mavens, and even hubs. Opinion leaders are specific to a product category, so that an opinion leader for computers is not likely to be an opinion leader for fashion. Typically, opinion leaders have high levels of involvement with the product category, are heavy users of the category, and tend to be early adopters of new technologies within the category. Journalists, celebrities, and bloggers are good examples of an opinion leader due to their broad social networks and increased ability to influence people&#x27;s decisions. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that bloggers may be emerging as a more important group of opinion leaders than celebrities.

In order to leverage the value of opinion leaders in marketing strategies, it is important to be able to identify the unique opinion leaders for each category or situation and this can be very challenging. Some techniques that can be used are through key informants, socio-metric techniques and self-questionnaires. More often, however, marketers use gut instinct to identify opinion leaders. For example, marketers of athletic shoes have been known to provide gym and aerobic instructors with free shoes in the hope that class members will adopt the same brand as the instructor. Marketers of cosmetics and skincare preparations regularly provide fashion editors with free samples in the hope that their products will be mentioned in fashion magazines.

=== Influences on consumer purchasing behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic ===

Evidence shows that certain consumer purchasing behaviours rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as result of external and internal factors. Namely, behaviours such as compulsive buying, impulsive buying, panic buying, and revenge buying – where panic buying and revenge buying were most noticeable – proved as a coping strategy for alleviating consumers&#x27; negative responses to the pandemic.

Panic buying occurs when consumers purchase more things than usual as a consequence of adverse feelings of fear, anxiety and uncertainty surrounding a crisis or disruptive event. Such purchases tend to be excessive in relation to the perceived threat. During the pandemic, panic buying of necessities, such as food and hygiene products, increased across the globe. Consider, in particular, that Australia faced an unprecedented spike in toilet paper sales, prompting comments from its Prime Minister. Panic buying – in response to an irrational fear of scarcity of products and heightened urgency to procure coveted items – provided a sense of control for consumers during the pandemic, notwithstanding a loss of control to the social, professional and health environments around them.

In addition to panic buying throughout the pandemic, revenge buying was apparent during periods when non-essential stores reopened after COVID-19-related lockdowns. Revenge buying was specifically observed in physical luxury retail stores. For example, it was reported that an Hermes store in Guangzhou, China, made US$2.7 million in the first day it opened after lockdown, where consumers&#x27; purchases ranged from leather goods, scarves and homewares to a diamond-studded Birkin bag, among other things.

The purchase of luxury products – where &#x27;luxury&#x27; is defined as high quality, expensive and non-necessary – is associated with positive emotions, often to compensate for negative feelings. Namely, revenge buying of luxury products provided an emotional release and a sense of belonging, esteem, and self-actualisation during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which people were frustrated and psychologically discomforted. Such purchases can be said to have achieved sensory gratification as well as problem avoidance for consumers.

It is clear that consumers sought to obtain internal happiness through consumption as a response to external health crises and social distancing measures. Both panic buying and revenge buying were compensatory in nature and therapeutic in nature – an attempt for consumers to control an external situation that was out of their internal control, as well as provide comfort, security, and improvement of well-being.

Due to the environmental trends, people begin to shop online more to avoid physical stores and stay contactless. Customers will spend more on sportswear than on professional dressing in 2020, and technology products related to teleworking, such as Zoom, also have more consumers than before.

Besides, studies have suggested that after the pandemic, people&#x27;s awareness of environmental hazards and society&#x27;s responsibility to save the planet increased, so societies changed their shopping behavior during the pandemic. People will choose sustainable products even though they cost more. In addition, stores and brands can adopt sustainable marketing to build a new brand image to attract customers.

Kannan and Kulkarni also illustrate some phenomena led by the channel migration caused by COVID-19. The first phenomenon is that customers are more open-minded to trying new brands and products because of the limitation of online channels of certain brands; the second phenomenon is that the long time pandemic restrictions make customers who use online channels as substitutes for their offline purchases initially now those customers have learned how to effectively use online channels for their daily lives.

== Consumer decision styles ==

A number of theorists have argued that certain fundamental decision-making styles can be identified. A decision-making style is defined as a &quot;mental orientation characterising a consumer&#x27;s approach to making choices.&quot; Sproles and Kendall (1986) developed a consumer style inventory (CSI) consisting of eight factors, such as price-sensitivity, quality-consciousness, brand-consciousness, novelty-seeking, fashion-consciousness, and habit. Based on these factors, the authors developed a typology of eight distinct decision-making styles:
* Quality conscious/Perfectionist: characterised by a consumer&#x27;s search for the very best quality in products; quality conscious consumers tend to shop systematically making more comparisons and shopping around to compare quality and value.
* Brand-conscious: characterised by a tendency to buy expensive, well-known brands, or designer labels. Those who score high on brand-consciousness tend to believe that the higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a preference for department stores or top-tier retail outlets. The concept of Brand Consciousness can be defined as the awareness of the brand and its product offerings that are quite distinctive from the other brands in the market having a competitive advantage. The consumers are very concerned about what the brand company thinks about its name and products.
* Recreation-conscious/Hedonistic: characterised by the consumer&#x27;s engagement in the purchase process. Those who score high on recreation-consciousness regard shopping itself as a form of enjoyment.
* Price-conscious: characterised by price-and-value consciousness. Price-conscious shoppers carefully shop around seeking lower prices, sales, or discounts and are motivated by obtaining the best value for money.
* Novelty/fashion-conscious: characterised by a consumer&#x27;s tendency to seek out new products or new experiences for the sake of excitement; who gain excitement from seeking new things; they like to keep up-to-date with fashions and trends. Variety-seeking is associated with this dimension.
* Impulsive: characterised by carelessness in making purchase decisions, spur of the moment purchases, and lack of significant concern with expenditure levels or obtaining value. Those who score high on impulsive dimensions tend not to be engaged with the object at either a cognitive or emotional level.
* Confused (by over-choice): characterised by a consumer&#x27;s confusion caused by too many product choices, too many stores, or an overload of product information. A result of information overload.
* Habitual/brand loyal: characterised by a consumer&#x27;s tendency to follow a routine purchase pattern on each purchase occasion; consumers have favourite brands or stores and have formed habits in choosing so the purchase decision does not involve much evaluation or shopping around.

The Consumer Styles Inventory (CSI) has been extensively tested and retested in a wide variety of countries and purchasing contexts. Many empirical studies have observed cross-cultural variations in decision styles, leading to numerous adaptations or modifications of the CSI scale for use in specific countries. Consumer decision styles are important for marketers because they describe behaviours that are relatively stable over time and are therefore useful for market segmentation.

== Other topics in consumer behaviour ==

In addition to understanding the purchasing decision, marketers are interested in a number of different aspects of consumer behaviour that occur before, during, and after making a purchase choice. Areas of particular interest include risk perception and risk reduction activities, brand switching, channel switching, brand loyalty, customer citizenship behaviours, and post purchase behavioural intentions and behaviours including brand advocacy, referrals, word of mouth activity etc.

=== Risk perception and risk reduction activities ===
The consumer&#x27;s perceptions of risk are a major consideration in the pre-purchase stage of the purchasing decision. Perceived risk is defined as &quot;the consumer&#x27;s perceptions of the uncertainty and adverse consequences of engaging in an activity&quot;. Risk consists of two dimensions: &quot;consequences&quot; which refer to the degree of importance or the severity of an outcome and &quot;uncertainty&quot; which is the consumer&#x27;s subjective assessment of the likelihood of occurrence. For example, many tourists are fearful of air travel because, although the probability of being involved in an airline accident is very low, the consequences are potentially dire.

The marketing literature identifies many different types of risk, of which five are the most frequently cited:

* Financial Risk: the potential financial loss in the event of a poor decision
* Performance Risk (also known as &quot;functional risk&quot;): the idea that a product or service will not perform as intended
* Physical Risk: the potential for physical harm if something goes wrong with a purchase
* Social Risk: the potential for loss of social status associated with a purchase
* Psychological Risk: the potential for a purchase to result in a loss of self-esteem

If a consumer perceives a purchase to be risky, they will engage in strategies to reduce the perceived risk until it is within their tolerance levels or, if they are unable to do so, withdraw from the purchase. Thus, the consumer&#x27;s perceptions of risk drive information search activities.

Services marketers have argued that risk perception is higher for services because they lack the search attributes of products (i.e. tangible properties that can be inspected prior to consumption). In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists identify three broad classes of purchase: search goods, experience goods, and credence goods with implications for consumer evaluation processes. Search goods, which include most tangible products, possess tangible characteristics that allow consumers to evaluate quality prior to purchase and consumption. Experience goods, such as restaurants and clubs, can only be evaluated with certainty after purchase or consumption. In the case of credence goods, such as many professional services, the consumer finds it difficult to fully appreciate the quality of the goods even after purchase and consumption has occurred. Difficulties evaluating quality after consumption may arise because the cost of obtaining information is prohibitive, or because the consumer lacks the requisite skills and knowledge to undertake such evaluations. These goods are called credence products because the consumer&#x27;s quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.

Typical risk-reduction strategies used include:
* Advertising and Promotional Messages: pay closer attention to product or brand related promotion including advertising messages
* Shopping Around: comparing offers and prices, inspecting the merchandise
* Buy Known Brand: using a known, reputable brand as an indicator of quality merchandise
* Buy from Reputable Store: relying on a reputable retail outlet as an indicator of quality
* Product Reviews: reading independent reviews in main media (e.g. newspapers, magazines), written by independent experts
* Online product reviews or consumer-generated testimonials: reading about the experiences of other consumers (e.g. TripAdvisor, Amazon customer reviews)
* Sampling or Limited-scale Trial: where practical, obtaining samples, free trial or a &#x27;test-drive&#x27; prior to purchase
* Manufacturer Specifications: reading information provided by manufacturers e.g. brochures or specs
* Referrals: obtaining referrals from friends or relatives
* Sales Representatives: talking to sales reps in retail outlets
* Product Guarantees: looking for formal guarantees or warranties

=== New product adoption and diffusion of innovations ===
Within consumer behaviour, a particular area of interest is the study of how innovative new products, services, ideas, or technologies spread through groups. Insights about how innovations are diffused (i.e., spread) through populations can assist marketers to speed up the new product adoption process and fine-tune the marketing program at different stages of the diffusion process. In addition, diffusion models provide benchmarks against which new product introductions can be tracked.

A sizeable body of literature has been devoted to the diffusion of innovation. Research studies tend to fall into two broad categories: general diffusion research which is an approach that seeks to understand the general process of diffusion and applied diffusion research which consists of studies that describe the diffusion of specific products at particular moments in time or within given social communities. Collectively these studies suggest a certain regularity in the adoption process; initially few members adopt the innovation but over time successive, overlapping waves of people begin to adopt the innovation. This pattern contributes to a generalised S-shaped curve, as shown in the figure at right. However, the exact shape and timing of curves varies in different product markets such that some innovations are diffused relatively quickly, while others can take many years to achieve broad market acceptance.

The diffusion model developed by Everett Rogers is widely used in consumer marketing because it segments consumers into five groups, based on their rate of new product adoption. Rogers defines the diffusion of innovation as the process by which that innovation is &quot;communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.&quot; Thus the diffusion process has a number of elements, the innovation, the communication channels, time and the social system. An innovation is any new idea, object or process that is perceived as new by members of the social system. Communication channels are the means by which information about the innovation is transmitted to members of the social system and may include mass media, digital media and personal communications between members of the social system. Time refers to the rate at which the innovation is picked up by the members of the social system.

Table 1: Adopter Categories
A number of factors contribute to the rate at which innovations are diffused through a social community.

* Relative advantage: the degree to which an innovation is perceived to be superior to alternatives
* Compatibility: the extent to which an innovation fits in with an individual&#x27;s values, lifestyles and past experiences
* Complexity: the degree to which an innovation is perceived to be easy or difficult to understand and use
* Trialability: the extent to which an individual can experiment with the innovation on a limited scale prior to adoption
* Observability: the degree to which the results of the innovation are visible to other members of the social community
Innovations with some or all of these factors are more likely to be adopted quickly. Accordingly, marketing communications may stress the innovation&#x27;s relative benefits over other solutions to the consumer&#x27;s problem. Marketing messages may also focus on compatibility and observability. Marketers can also facilitate adoption by offering limited scale trial (e.g. samples, test drives, sale on approval) enabling consumers to develop an understanding of the innovation and how it is used prior to purchase.

Studies have shown that the diffusion rate for many new technologies is speeding up. The figure in the &quot;Household Penetration of Selected Communications Technologies&quot; report illustrates U.S. household penetration rates of selected communications technologies, measured as a percentage of all households. The slope of the curve becomes steeper with each successive innovation indicating a more rapid diffusion rate. For example, it took decades for the telephone to achieve 50 percent penetration rates beginning in around 1900, but it took less than five years for cellphones to achieve the same penetration rates. In order to explain the increasing pace of adoption, some have pointed to supply-side issues such as reduced barriers to entry and lower costs of innovation, while others have argued that consumers drive adoption rates because they place a high value on the convenience of new innovations.

=== Brand-switching ===
Brand-switching occurs when a consumer chooses to purchase a different brand from their regular or customary brand. Consumers switch brands for a variety of reasons including that the store did not have the regular brand or the consumer&#x27;s desire for variety or novelty in brand choice. In the fast moving consumer goods market (FMCG), the incidence of switching is relatively high. A great deal of marketing activity is targeted at brand-switchers. Rossiter and Bellman have proposed a classification of consumers based on brand-loyalty/switching behaviour:

;Brand Loyals: Purchase preferred brand on almost every purchase occasion
;Favourable Brand Switchers: Exhibit moderate preference for the brand or brands that they buy and can be readily enticed to purchase competing brands
;Other Brand Switchers: Normally purchase a competing brand, possibly because they are unaware of our brand or due to a negative experience with our brand
;New Category Users: Those who are unaware of a category but have potential to become new users

Marketers are particularly interested in understanding the factors that lead to brand-switching. A global, large sample survey carried out by Nielsen shows that four in 10 shoppers (41%) said that getting a better price would encourage them to switch brands (or service provider/retailer), 26% said quality was an incentive to switch, 15% looked for a better service agreement and 8% said that improved features are a switching incentive. However, cross-cultural differences were observed among respondents. Price was the major switch incentive for more than half of North Americans (61%) and Europeans (54%) but price and quality held equal sway in Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa, with roughly one-third of respondents each in both regions reporting that both price and quality were the major incentives to switching.

The concept of &quot;switching costs&quot; (also known as switching barriers) is pertinent to the understanding of brand switching. Switching costs refer to the costs incurred by a consumer when they switch from one supplier to another (or from one brand to another). Although switching costs are often monetary, the concept can also refer to psychological costs such as time, effort, and inconvenience incurred as a result of switching. When switching costs are relatively low, as in the case of many fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), the incidence of brand switching tends to be higher. An example of switching that includes both monetary and psychological costs is when Android or Apple users wish to switch to a different platform, they would need to sacrifice their data, including purchased music tracks, apps, or media and may also need to learn new routines to become an efficient user.

=== Channel-switching ===
Channel-switching (not to be confused with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching to a different purchasing environment (or distribution channel) to purchase goods, such as switching from brick-and-mortar stores to the internet. A major reason for this channel switching behaviour is the convenience that online shopping provides for consumers. Consumers can shop online at any hour of the day, without having to drive, travel or walk to a physical store, and browse for as little or as much time as they please. The additional lure of &#x27;online only&#x27; deals and discounts helps enforce a consumer&#x27;s preference to shop online. Other factors for this shift are the globalisation of markets, the advent of category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids &#x27;R Us) as well as changes in the legal regulatory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.

For the consumer, channel switching offers a more diverse shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to channel switching because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply because it is more convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.

=== Impulse buying ===

According to 1962 research from Hawkins Stern, impulse purchases fall into four categories: including pure impulse buying, reminded impulse buying, suggestion impulse buying, and planned impulse buying. While pure impulse buying involves a customer experiencing strong desire for a product they didn&#x27;t initially plan to buy, reminded impulse buying occurs when a buyer remembers a need for a product by seeing it in a store. Suggestion impulse buying occurs when a consumer sees a product that they have no prior knowledge about, envisions a use for it, and decides that they need it, and planned impulse buying happens when a consumer&#x27;s purchasing plan changes while shopping.

;:

2013 research carried out by Nielsen International suggests that about 72 percent of FMCG purchases are planned, but that 28 percent of supermarket purchases are unplanned or impulse purchases. The top unplanned purchases in the food category are candy (lollies), chocolate, cookies (biscuits), frozen desserts, and snacks and the top unplanned purchases in the non-food category are cosmetics, air-fresheners, toothbrushes, hand-soaps, and hand/body lotions. This explains why supermarkets place these types of products at the front of the store or near the checkout where the consumer spends more time and is more likely to notice them and therefore more likely to pop them into the shopping basket. Retailers use insights from this type of research to design stores in ways that maximise opportunities for impulse-buying.

=== Affect: Emotions, feelings and mood ===
The consumer&#x27;s affective state has implications for a number of different dimensions of consumer behaviour, including information search, evaluation of alternatives, product choice, service encounters, complaining, and advertising responses. Westbrook (1987, p. 259) defines affect as a &quot;class of mental phenomena uniquely characterised by a consciously experienced, subjective feeling state, commonly accompanying emotions and moods.&quot; Research suggests that affect plays an important role in underlying attitudes, as well as shaping evaluation and decision-making.

Consumer researchers have noted the difficulties separating the concepts of affect, emotions, feelings, and mood. The line between emotions and mood is difficult to draw and consumer researchers often use the concepts interchangeably. Yet other researchers note that a detailed understanding of the relationship between affect and consumer behaviour has been hampered by the lack of research in the area. Indeed, within the consumer behaviour literature, there is widespread agreement that the role of emotions is an area that is currently under-researched and is in need of greater attention, both theoretically and empirically.

====Information search====

Studies have found that people in a positive mood are more efficient at information search activities. That, is they are more efficient at processing information, are able to integrate information by identifying useful relationships and arrive at creative solutions to problems. Due to their efficiency processing information, those who are in a positive mood are generally quicker to make decisions and easier to please. Research consistently shows that people in a positive mood are more likely to evaluate information positively. As online environments become more important as a consumer search tool, it may be prudent for web designers to consider site-design issues such as ease of navigation, lest poor design contribute to customer frustration thereby engendering a bad mood and ultimately leading to unfavourable product/brand evaluations.

====Choice====

Affect may play an important role in impulse-buying decisions. Research suggests that consumers place higher weightings on immediate affective rewards and punishments, while delayed rewards receive less weighting. For instance, the immediate pleasure of eating a sweet treat often outweighs the longer term benefits of eating a healthy alternative such as fruit. This occurs because the immediate emotional gain is a strong driver, and one that consumers can readily visualise whereas the more distant goal lacks sufficient strength to drive choice.

====Customer experience====

Customers who are in a bad mood are more difficult to please. They are slower to process information and consequently take longer to make decisions. They tend to be more argumentative and are more likely to complain.

====Customer satisfaction====

The relationship between affect and customer satisfaction is an area that has received considerable academic attention, especially in the services marketing literature. The proposition that there is a positive relationship between affect and satisfaction is well supported in the literature. In a meta-analysis of the empirical evidence, carried out in 2001, Szymanski et al., suggest that affect may be both an antecedent to and an outcome of satisfaction. Emotions elicited during consumption are proposed to leave affective traces in memory that are available for consumers to access and integrate into their satisfaction assessments.

A 2011 meta-analysis illustrates how both repurchase intent and loyalty enjoy a strong positive relationship (0.54) with customer satisfaction. Another meta-analysis finds that &quot;The results indicate that both cognitive-related variables (including brand awareness, brand personality, and brand identity) and hedonic-related variables (including hedonic attitude, entertainment, and aesthetic appeal) have significant impacts on quality and value perceptions towards the brand (including perceived quality, reputation, brand image, perceived value, commitment, and trust). In addition, these variables are all significant predictors of brand loyalty.&quot;

A third meta-analysis, from 2013 elaborates on the concept of brand personality (bp): &quot;First, the key drivers of BP are communication with hedonic benefit claims, branding activities, a brand&#x27;s country-of-origin, and consumer personalities. Second, the study finds that the effects of BP are stronger for mature brands than for brands in the early life cycle stages. Third, sincerity and competence have the strongest influence on brand success variables (e.g., brand attitude, image, commitment, purchase intention), while excitement and ruggedness have the weakest influence on brand attitude and brand commitment.&quot;

====Advertising====

Emotion can play an important role in advertising. In advertising, two different approaches to persuasion are common: (a) &quot;thinking ads&quot; that require cognitive processing (also known as the &quot;central route to persuasion&quot;) and, (b) &quot;feeling ads&quot; that are processed at an emotional level (also known as the &quot;peripheral route&quot;). Advertisers can bypass cognitive, rational processing which can lead to counter-arguing by simply appealing to the emotions. Neuro-imaging studies suggest that when evaluating brands, consumers primarily use emotions (personal feelings and experiences) rather than information (brand attributes, features, and facts).

It is relatively widely accepted that emotional responses require fewer processing resources (i.e. are easier) and also result in more enduring associations with the brand being advertised. Feelings elicited by the advertising message can shape attitudes towards the brand and to the advertisement.

=== Customer loyalty ===
Customer loyalty, defined as &quot;the relationship between an individual&#x27;s relative attitude and repeat patronage&quot; (Dick and Basu, 1994: p. 99). Thus, by definition, loyalty has both an attitudinal component and a behavioural component. Dick and Basu proposed four types of loyalty based on relative attitude and patronage behaviour:

;No Loyalty: Characterised by low relative attitude and low repeat patronage behaviour. May occur when competing brands are seen as similar or in the case of new brands (or categories) where insufficient time has elapsed for loyalty to become established.
;Spurious Loyalty: Characterised by low relative attitude and high repeat patronage. Spurious loyalty occurs when the consumer undertakes repeat purchasing due to situational factors such as access, convenience. or shelf placement. Spurious loyalty can also occur when there are no genuine alternatives or the consumer is &#x27;locked-in&#x27; to purchasing a given brand due to some quasi-contractual arrangement or membership status which creates difficulties for switching. In other words, where switching costs are relatively high, high patronage behaviour may be observed despite the absence of a favourable attitude towards the brand. An example would be a consumer who always purchases petrol from the same outlet on the way to work because there are no other outlets in the vicinity.
;Latent Loyalty: Characterised by high relative attitude and low repeat patronage. Latent loyalty occurs when situational factors over-ride strong favourable attitudes. For example, a person may have a preferred restaurant but may not patronise it due to the preferences of dining companions.
;Loyalty: (i.e. true loyalty) Characterised by favourable attitude and favourable patronage behaviour. For marketers, true loyalty is the ideal situation.

Loyalty marketing programs are built on the insight that it costs 5-20 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing customer. Marketers use a variety of loyalty programs to strengthen customer attitudes towards the brand (or service provider/retailer) in order to retain customers, minimise customer defections, and strengthen loyalty bonds with existing customers. Broadly there are two types of program: reward and recognition programs. In a Reward Program, the customer accumulates points for each purchase, and the points can subsequently be exchanged for goods or services. Recognition Programs operate on a quasi-membership basis where the consumer is issued with a card that upon presentation leads to various entitlements such as free upgrades, special privileges, or access to products/services that are not normally available to non- members, and that acknowledge the loyal customer&#x27;s &quot;VIP&quot; status. For example, a hotel might recognise loyal patrons by providing a complimentary fruit bowl and bottle of champagne in the room on arrival. Whereas reward programs are motivated by the consumer&#x27;s desire for material possessions, recognition programs are motivated by the consumer&#x27;s need for esteem, recognition, and status. Many commercial loyalty programs are hybrid schemes, combining elements of both reward and recognition. In addition, not all reward programs are designed to encourage loyalty. Certain reward programs are designed to encourage other types of positive customer behaviour such as the provision of referrals or providing positive word-of-mouth (WOM) recommendations.

Loyalty marketing can involve the use of databases and sophisticated software to analyse and profile customer loyalty segments with a view to identifying the most desirable segments, setting goals for each segment, and ultimately attempting to increase the size of the loyal customer base.

=== Customer citizenship behaviour ===

Customer citizenship behaviour is the labor that customers do for brands out of loyalty. The services marketing literature identifies seven distinct types of citizenship behaviour: voice (when customers direct their complaint to the service provider in order to rectify and maintain the relationship), display of affiliation, policing (the observation of other customers to ensure their appropriate behaviour), flexibility, service improvement (providing ideas and suggestions for organisations), word-of-mouth referrals, and benevolent acts of service. 

=== Internet consumer behaviour ===
Traditional models of consumer behaviour were developed by scholars such as Fishbein and Ajzen and Howard and Sheth in the 1960s and 70s. More recently, Shun and Yunjie have argued that online consumer behaviour is different to offline behaviour and as a consequence requires new theories or models. After COVID-19, online consumer behaviour seems more essential, because since COVID-19 began, there were about 31% more people started shopping online with 43% of all respondents compared to only 12% of respondents before COVID-19.

Research has identified two types of consumer value in purchasing, namely product value and shopping value. Product value is likely to be similar for both online and offline shoppers. However, the shopping experience will be substantially different for online shoppers. In an offline shopping environment, consumers derive satisfaction from being within the physical store environment or retail landscape (hedonic motivations). In the case of online purchasing, shoppers derive satisfaction from their ability to navigate a website and the convenience of online searching which allows them to compare prices and &#x27;shop around&#x27; with minimal time commitment. Thus the online consumer is motivated by more utilitarian factors.

==== Different types of online behaviour ====
Consumers may use online platforms for various stages of the purchase decision. Some consumers use online sources simply to acquire information about planned purchases. Others use online platforms for making the actual purchase. In other situations, consumers may also use online platforms to engage in post-purchase behaviours, such as staying connected with a brand by joining a brand community. Or they may become a brand advocate by posting a product review online, or providing brand referrals via social media. Some e-commerce providers have encountered a challenge in courting consumers who seek information online, but still prefer to turn to bricks and mortar retailers for their purchase. To understand the needs and habits of these and other kinds of online shoppers, online marketers have segmented consumers into different kinds of online behaviour in accordance with their online behavioural characteristics. Lewis and Lewis (1997) identified five market segments based on the way that consumers use the Internet in the purchase decision process:

# &quot;Directed Information-seekers&quot; are users that primarily look for information about a product or service online, but there is no guarantee that they may be converted into online buyers. 
# &quot;Undirected Information-seekers&quot; are newcomers to a product or service. They are more likely to interact with online prompts, and click through to web pages linked in advertising. 
# &quot;Directed Buyers&quot; have a predetermined mindset and wish to purchase a specific product or service online. 
# &quot;Bargain Hunters&quot; are price-sensitive users that like to discover products during sales promotions. For these users, discounts are a major attraction to online sales conversion. 
# &quot;Entertainment Seekers&quot; are online consumers that are attracted to marketing delivered as a fun activity. Interactive online games could be useful in attracting this kind of customer.

==== A typology of online consumer behaviour ====
Wendy Moe (2003) argues that in the offline environment, consumers who are shopping in stores can be easily classified by experienced sales employees only by watching their shopping behaviours. Such classification may not appear online, but Moe and Fader argued that it is feasible to predict practical buying, surfing, and searching action online by investigating click patterns and repetition of visit within online behaviour. In addition, a report of E-consultancy about &quot;benchmarking of user experience&quot; outlined three kinds of online consuming behaviour as a valuable classification for the research of design of web pages to better serve different kinds of consuming behaviour. The three categories are: &quot;trackers&quot;, &quot;hunters&quot;, and &quot;explorers&quot;.
# &quot;Trackers&quot; are the online consumers who are exactly looking for a product that they definitely wish to buy. They use the Internet for the information about its price, delivery methods, post-purchase service, and so on. Once they have found the proper information, little effort is needed to let them do the business.
# &quot;Hunters&quot; just know the categories of the product that they need, for instance, a novel for leisure time. However, they have not made specific decision on whose novel to buy. They use the Internet to find a list of product of their needed categories to make comparison. This kind of online consumer needs advice and help to do their business. 
# &quot;Explorers&quot; do not even have the categories of product on their minds. In fact, they just want to buy something online. There is more uncertainty of this type of online consumers.

==== Influence of the Internet on buying process ====

As the preceding table shows, the first row indicates the process of a consumer buying a new product, while the second and third row illustrates the positive influences the Internet could have on buying process by creating effective communications with online consumers. For example, suppose a consumer carelessly sees an advertisement about laptops on Wechat, a popular Chinese social media developed by Tencent. He begins to feel that his laptop is a bit out of date and wants to buy a new one, which is the outcome of good advertisement placed on a daily Internet tool. He does not know anything about how to buy a new one as business changes so fast today, so he searches on Google to find an answer. On the results page he finds promotional ads which mainly come from JD.com and Taobao, two competing Chinese online retailers in this field. He prefers to use JD.com, which provides detailed comparisons of brands, prices, locations, and methods of payment and delivery. After careful selection, he makes his order through JD.com via Wechat payment. JD.com has one of the fastest distribution channels within China and it supports excellent post-purchase service to maintain its position in the market.

=== The role of aesthetics and visual fluency in relation to consumer choice ===
Consumers decide whether or not they like a product within 90 seconds of viewing it for the first time. Therefore, having an aesthetically pleasing product is essential in the marketplace. Studies in processing fluency and consumer behaviour have revealed that &quot;that people prefer visual displays that are easier to process and understand.&quot; and &quot;When a product matches the user&#x27;s associations with it it is perceived as more attractive.&quot; Visually fluent products draw upon consumer&#x27;s pre-existing associations with their design elements, leading to a sense of familiarity and understanding with the product at hand. Visual cues such as colour, composition, typography, and imagery are associated with the phenomenon of fluency.

==== Colour ====
Research in colour psychology has shown 62-90% of consumer product assessment is based on colour alone. Indeed, colours have been shown to be linked to consumer&#x27;s perceptions on a product&#x27;s quality, reliability, and value. The colours blue and black are viewed as being more reliable, valuable, and expensive while yellow, orange, and brown are associated with cheapness and low quality. Therefore, a product intended to be perceived as &quot;high quality&quot; with a predominately orange and brown palette would lack visual fluency and would likely fail to elicit a positive response with consumers. However, this can be advantageous if the consumer is already in the market for an item that is known to be inexpensive, in which case the use of yellow, orange, or brown would be appropriate. Colour can also be used to signal brand personality.

==== Composition ====
Composition is another visual tool that has the ability to affect information processing and influence in consumer perceptions. Studies have shown that consumers in western countries will associate products that are right aligned or placed on the right side of a display to be higher quality. Humans also have a center bias, which makes products that are centered or symmetrical in composition or display seem intrinsically more pleasing. Products that are centered in composition or have centered elements are perceived as being more attractive, popular, and important than products that are left aligned or right aligned. When an object is centered compositionally, it easier for a viewer to interpret and understand. It becomes more &quot;fluent&quot; and is therefore viewed as being more aesthetically pleasing.

==== Imagery ====
Evidence has shown that pictorial imagery correlates to higher instances of consumer recall and recognition. Pictorial imagery is also easier to process and gains consumer&#x27;s attention faster. There is significant evidence that when consumers are presented with multiple choices, they will view objects more positively and more aesthetically pleasing when surrounded by congruent imagery. After repeated exposure, this familiar imagery becomes incorporated into consumer&#x27;s visual lexicon and they become &quot;fluent&quot; in it. Images with higher levels of visual fluency perceived as being more familiar, likeable, and friendly and are therefore more likely to be chosen by consumers.

==== Typographic elements ====
Although studies have shown that of pictorial imagery is easier for consumers to process and understand, the choice of typography remains an indispensable element of product design. Handwritten and scripted fonts are associated with individuality, femininity, and luxury while sans serif fonts embody energy, cleanliness, and modernity. Font size has also been shown to have a direct correlation on the emotional attributes assigned to a product. One study has shown that larger type size and weight is perceived as more intimidating and authoritative. Although imagery reigns supreme in product design, type is processed just as easily as pictorial information when the consumer is already familiar with the product.

=== Environmental impact ===

An aspect of Individual action on climate change is consumer behaviour that affects how much and what kinds of materials are used to produce goods and food, how much material is recycled or composted, how much ends up as pollution, how much ends up in landfills, where goods are produced, how far they travel, and the carbon footprint of manufacturing, transportation, and disposal. Green marketing targets consumers who take the environmental impact of their purchases into account. One 2017 study found no impact of green marketing on consumer behaviour in Bangladesh. The study suggests policies be made that decrease the cost of eco-friendly products. It also encourages the implementation of programs which raise consumer awareness regarding the issue of green consumption.

There are psychological factors which contribute to a consumer&#x27;s perception surrounding their personal contributions to climate change inducing actions. One of the more well studied biases is referred to as the &quot;better-than-average&quot;, or self-enhancing bias. This bias depicts an individual&#x27;s tendency to perceive that their actions are superior, especially when compared to peers or demographically similar consumers. It has been found that this cognitive bias is indeed present when considering how consumers perceive their pro-environmental efforts. This may be a result of information about climate change leading to feelings of guilt and concern, which activates an unconscious thought process (denial, the better-than-average effect, and other cognitive reactions) that leads to a reduced perception of the threat of climate change. It is a mental defense mechanism that ultimately leads to a reduction in perceived individual responsibility to take part in green behaviours and one-planet-living.

== Research methods used ==
To gain insights into consumer behaviour, researchers uses the standard battery of market research methods such as surveys, depth interviews, and focus groups. Increasingly, researchers are turning to newer methodologies and technologies in an effort to seek deeper understandings of why consumers behave in certain ways. These newer methods include &quot;ethnographic research&quot; (also known as participant observation) and &quot;neuroscience&quot; as well as experimental lab designs. In addition, researchers often turn to separate disciplines for insights with potential to inform the study of consumer behaviour. For instance, behavioural economics is adding new insights into certain aspects of consumer behaviour.

=== Ethnographic research ===
Ethnographic research or ethnography has its origins in anthropology. However, marketers use ethnographic research to study the consumer in terms of cultural trends, lifestyle factors, attitudes and the way that social context influences product selection, consumption, and usage. Ethnographic research, also called &quot;participant observation&quot;, attempts to study consumer behaviour in natural settings rather than in artificial environment such as labs. Different types of ethnographic research are used in marketing including;
* Observed product usage: observing regular product usage at home or work, to gain insights into how products are opened, prepared, consumed, stored, disposed etc. to gain insights into the usefulness of packaging, labelling and general usage
* Day-in-the-life studies: extended visits during product usage situations to gain insights into norms and consumer expectations
* Accompanied purchase or shop-alongs: researcher accompanies a shopper on a purchase expedition to gain insights into consumer responses to merchandising and other sales tactics
* Cultural studies: similar to traditional ethnography; extended stays with a group or tribe with a view to uncovering the fundamental rules and conventions that govern behaviour
* Guerilla ethnography: random observations in public settings to help establish research questions or to gain quick insights into specific behaviours
* Mystery shopping: observations in the retail context with a view to gaining insights into the customer&#x27;s service experience
* Multiple methodologies: combining ethnographic research methods with conventional research techniques with a view to triangulating results

Trendspotters such as Faith Popcorn&#x27;s BrainReserve make extensive use of ethnographic research to spot emergent trends.

=== Consumer neuroscience ===
Consumer neuroscience (also known as neuromarketing) refers to the commercial use of neuroscience when applied to the investigation of marketing problems and consumer research. Some researchers have argued that the term &quot;consumer neuroscience&quot; is preferred over neuromarketing or other alternatives.

Consumer neuroscience employs sophisticated bio-metric sensors, such as electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking, to study the ways that consumers respond to specific stimuli such as product displays, brands, packaging information, or other marketing signals. Such tests reveal stimuli that trigger the brain&#x27;s pleasure centre.

Consumer neuroscience has become a mainstream component of consumer research methods. International market research company Nielsen Research has recently added neuromarketing to its services by acquiring Innerscope, a company specialising in neuromarketing research thus enabling Nielsen to add neuromarketing research to the suite of services available to clients.

Consumer neuroscience research has led to some surprising findings:

;Framing price or value: For example, one study reported on a magazine subscription where potential subscribers were offered two options: an online subscription for $59, or a combined online and print for $129 a year. Most people chose the online only option. However, when a third option was introduced: print only for $129 (i.e. &quot;the decoy&quot;), the online and print option seemed like better value and a significant number of people switched to that option. In other words, the &quot;decoy&quot; price assists in framing value. Marketers use a variety of methods to &quot;frame value&quot;: e.g. quote monthly payment options rather than a single all-inclusive price.
;Choice fatigue: Research by Sheena Iyengar experimented with the number of gourmet jams on display. When consumers were faced with a large number of alternatives (24 jams), 60% of consumers stopped and looked but only a few (3%) actually made a purchase. However, when consumers faced with fewer brands (6 jams), were more likely to make a purchase with 30% going on to buy something. Similar results have been observed in other categories. The findings suggest that while consumers appreciate being given some choice, the process of making a selection is painful and can lead to choice fatigue. An issue for marketers and retailers is to determine the &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; where consumers are given sufficient choice to satisfy their desire for variety, but not become overwhelmed by it.
;Decision paralysis: One study examined the wording used to solicit philanthropic donations. Consumers were exposed to variants in the advertising copy execution: &quot;Would you be willing to help by giving a donation?&quot; and &quot;Would you be willing to help by giving a donation? Every penny will help.&quot; Those given the second option were almost twice as likely to donate. The researchers concluded that people are more likely to take action when given parameters. By clarifying that &quot;even a penny&quot; could make a difference, the second line provides guidance and makes the request more achievable. For marketers, the implication is that when asking consumers to take an action, specifying a small step helps to break through the action paralysis. This finding also suggests that even small differences in advertising copy can lead to improved outcomes. Action instructions will make the advertisement more purposeful.

<doc id="754962" wikidata="Q106164" url="?curid=754962" title="João Bernardo Vieira">
<text>João Bernardo &quot;Nino&quot; Vieira (; 27 April 1939 – 2 March 2009) was a Bissau-Guinean politician who served as President of Guinea-Bissau from 1980 to 1999, except for a three-day period in May 1984, and from 2005 until his assassination in 2009.

After seizing power from President Luís Cabral in a military coup in 1980, Vieira ruled as part of the Military Council of the Revolution until 1984, when civilian rule was returned. Opposition parties were allowed in 1991, and Vieira won a multiparty presidential election in 1994. He was ousted at the end of the 1998–1999 civil war and went into exile. He made a political comeback in 2005, winning that year&#x27;s presidential election.

Vieira was killed by soldiers on 2 March 2009, apparently in retaliation for a bomb blast that killed Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s military chief General Batista Tagme Na Waie hours before. The military officially denied these allegations after unidentified Army officials claimed responsibility of Vieira for Na-Waie&#x27;s death.

Vieira described himself as &quot;God&#x27;s gift&quot; to Guinea-Bissau during his tenure in office.

==Early life==
Vieira was born in Bissau, then a city of Portuguese Guinea. Originally trained as an electrician, he joined the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) of Amílcar Cabral in 1960 and soon became a key player in the territory&#x27;s guerrilla war against Portuguese colonial rule.

Vieira was a member of the Papel ethnic group, which comprises approximately 5% of Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s population. By contrast, most of Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s army officers, with whom Vieira had a tense relationship throughout his career, are members of the Balanta ethnicity, which dominates the country.

==Career==

=== Early career and Presidential Regime ===

As the war in Portuguese Guinea intensified, Vieira demonstrated a great deal of skill as a military leader and rapidly rose through its ranks. Vieira was known to his comrades as &quot;Nino&quot; and this remained his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; for the duration of the struggle. He was the cousin of slain military leader Osvaldo Vieira.

Following regional council elections held in late 1972 in areas under PAIGC control, which led to the formation of a constituent assembly, Vieira was appointed president of the National People&#x27;s Assembly. The guerrilla war began to turn against the Portuguese as expenditure, damages and loss of human lives remained a burden for Portugal. Following the coup d&#x27;état in Portugal in 1974, the new Portuguese revolutionary government which overthrew Lisbon&#x27;s Estado Novo regime began to negotiate with the PAIGC. As his brother Amílcar had been assassinated in 1973, Luís Cabral became the first president of independent Guinea-Bissau after independence was granted on 10 September 1974.

On 28 September 1978, Vieira was appointed as Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau.

By 1980, economic conditions had deteriorated significantly, which led to general dissatisfaction with the government. On 14 November 1980, Vieira toppled the government of Luís Cabral in a bloodless military coup, which initial reports credited to racial strife between the black population of Guinea-Bissau and the mulatto population of the related Republic of Cape Verde, embodied in the Cabo-Verdian origin of President Cabral. In the wake of the coup, the bordering Republic of Guinea quickly recognised the new government and sought to end a border dispute over an oil-rich region, while the PAIGC in Cape Verde split away and forming a separate party. The constitution was suspended and a nine-member military Council of the Revolution, chaired by Vieira, was set up. In 1984, a new constitution was approved that returned the country to civilian rule. In June 1986, six politicians were executed for the failed coup d&#x27;état against Vieira. However, in February 1993, Vieira&#x27;s regime ended Capital punishment in the country.

Guinea-Bissau, like the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, moved toward multiparty democracy in the early 1990s. Through pressure from groups like the Democratic Front (FD) led by Aristide Menezes, the ban on political parties was lifted in 1991 and elections were held in 1994. In the first round of the presidential election, held on 3 July 1994, Vieira received 46.20% of the vote against seven other candidates. He finished first, but failed to win the required majority, which led to a second round of voting on 7 August. He received 52.02% of the vote against 47.98% for Kumba Yalá, a former philosophy lecturer and candidate of the Social Renewal Party (PRS). International election observers considered both rounds generally free and fair. Vieira was sworn in as the first democratically elected president of Guinea-Bissau on 29 September 1994.

===Civil war===
Vieira was re-elected for another four-year term as President of PAIGC in mid-May 1998 at a party congress, with 438 votes in favor, eight opposed, and four abstaining.

Vieira dismissed military chief of staff Ansumane Mané on 6 June 1998, accusing him of smuggling arms to Casamance separatist rebels in Senegal. Mané and his supporters in the military promptly rebelled, and the country descended into a civil war between forces loyal to Vieira and rebels loyal to Mané. According to Birgit Embaló, soldiers in Guinea Bissau were upset at their pay, leading the military to self-finance itself through smuggling. Mané was widely supported by soldiers and war veterans, as well as by some of civil society and members of the political opposition to Vieira&#x27;s government.

A peace agreement was signed in November 1998, and a transitional government was formed in preparation for new elections in 1999. On 27 November 1998, the National People&#x27;s Assembly passed a motion demanding Vieira&#x27;s resignation, with 69 deputies supporting the motion and none opposing it.

A renewed outbreak of fighting occurred in Bissau on 6 May 1999, and Vieira&#x27;s forces surrendered on 7 May. He sought refuge in the Portuguese embassy and went into exile in Portugal in June. On 12 May, former prime minister Manuel Saturnino da Costa was named acting President of PAIGC, replacing Vieira. Vieira was expelled from PAIGC at a party congress in September 1999 for &quot;treasonable offences, support and incitement to warfare, and practices incompatible with the statutes of the party&quot;.

===Return===

After President Kumba Yalá was overthrown in September 2003 military coup, Vieira returned to Bissau from Portugal on 7 April 2005. Arriving in the city&#x27;s main football stadium by helicopter, he was met by over 5,000 cheering supporters. Although Vieira&#x27;s supporters had collected 30,000 signatures for a petition urging him to run for president, he did not immediately confirm his intention to do so, saying that he was returning &quot;to re-establish [his] civic rights and to register to vote in the coming elections&quot; and that he wanted to contribute to peace and stability. He also said that he had forgiven his enemies and that he hoped others would forgive him for any harm he had caused. On 16 April, it was announced that he intended to stand as a candidate in the June 2005 presidential election. Although many considered Vieira to be ineligible because he had been living in exile and because of legal charges against him pertaining to the 1985 killings of suspected coup plotters, he was cleared to stand in the election by the Supreme Court in May 2005, along with Yalá. The Court unanimously ruled in favor of his candidacy on the grounds that he had already ended his exile by returning in April and that no court records of the murder charges could be found. His old party, the PAIGC, backed former interim president Malam Bacai Sanhá as its candidate.

According to official results, Vieira placed second in the 19 June election with 28.87% of the vote, behind Malam Bacai Sanhá, and thus participated in the second round run-off. He officially defeated Sanhá in the run-off on 24 July with 52.45% of the vote and was sworn in as president on 1 October.

According to The Economist he probably invited Colombian drug traffickers to finance these elections.

On 28 October 2005, Vieira announced the dissolution of the government headed by his rival Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Junior, citing the need to maintain stability; on 2 November he appointed his political ally Aristides Gomes to the position.

In March 2007, PAIGC formed a three-party alliance with the Party for Social Renewal (PRS) and the United Social Democratic Party (PUSD), and the three parties sought to form a new government. This led to a successful no-confidence vote against Aristides Gomes and his resignation late in the month; on 9 April, the choice of the three parties for the position of prime minister, Martinho Ndafa Kabi, was appointed as prime minister by Vieira. In Kabi&#x27;s three-party government, Interior Minister Baciro Dabo was considered to be the only close ally of Vieira who was included. Later, after PAIGC withdrew from the three-party alliance to protest Kabi&#x27;s actions, Vieira dissolved the National People&#x27;s Assembly and appointed Carlos Correia to replace Kabi as prime minister on 5 August 2008.

On 6 August 2008, navy chief Bubo Na Tchuto was behind a failed coup attempt against Vieira.

==Attacks and death==

===November 2008 attack===
Rebellious soldiers attacked Vieira&#x27;s home in the early hours of 23 November 2008, shortly after the November 2008 parliamentary election, in which PAIGC won a majority of seats. The soldiers fired artillery at the house and were able to enter it during a three-hour battle with Vieira&#x27;s guards, but they were repelled before they could reach Vieira, who was unharmed. At least one of Vieira&#x27;s guards was killed, and others were injured. Vieira held a press conference later in the day, in which he said that the attack had &quot;a single objective – to physically liquidate me&quot;, while also asserting that &quot;the situation is under control&quot;. In a subsequent radio interview, he told citizens that they can count on the unconditional support of the president and questioned whether the country would continue like this, whether the state could do its job without interference, he accused the Army Chief of Staff, General Batista Tagme Na Waie, of being responsible for the attempted coup d&#x27;état and endangering stability, peace and democracy in the country.

===March 2009 attack===

Tagme Na Waie, a key rival of Vieira, was killed by a bomb blast on 1 March 2009. Hours later, Vieira was shot dead by a group of soldiers while fleeing from his private residence in the early hours of 2 March 2009. Diplomats from Angola attempted to take Vieira and his wife to the Angolan Embassy prior to his death, yet Vieira refused to leave while his wife, Isabel Vieira, was taken to safety. Bissau was described as &quot;tense but calm&quot; following his death. According to army spokesman Zamora Induta, Vieira was involved in the assassination of Tagme Na Waie, and Induta stated that &quot;President Vieira was killed by the army as he tried to flee his house which was being attacked by a group of soldiers close to the chief of staff Tagme Na Waie, early this morning&quot;. The army denied that Vieira&#x27;s killing marked a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and said that the constitutional order would be followed, meaning that the President of the National People&#x27;s Assembly, Raimundo Pereira, would succeed Vieira.

A doctor who was involved in Vieira&#x27;s autopsy was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying that Vieira was &quot;savagely beaten before being finished off with several bullets&quot;. British author Frederick Forsyth, who was in Bissau at the time of the attack, alleged a more detailed account of the president&#x27;s assassination. He claimed that during a meal with the forensic pathologist investigating the case, he was informed that Vieira was in fact hacked to death by soldiers wielding machetes at his mother-in-law&#x27;s house. According to this account, Vieira survived an explosion and the collapse of the presidential villa&#x27;s roof and was then shot when he emerged, injured, from the damaged building; nevertheless he remained alive until being taken to his mother-in-law&#x27;s house and hacked to death. Forsyth attributed the bloody events to mutual hatred between Vieira and Tagme Na Waie, and he characterized both of them as violent people.

The council of ministers created a commission of inquiry in an emergency meeting to investigate the two assassinations.

A state funeral for Vieira, attended by thousands of people, was held in Bissau on 10 March 2009. No foreign leaders were present. At the funeral service held at the National People&#x27;s Assembly, his daughter Elisa urged an end to the violence. The eulogy for Vieira stressed his importance in the war for independence and his adoption of multiparty politics and liberal economic reforms in the early 1990s.

====International reaction====
Mohamed Ibn Chambas, head of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), declared &quot;&#x27;The death of a president&#x27;, of a chief of staff, is very grave news,&quot; adding &quot;It&#x27;s not only the assassination of a president or a chief of staff, it&#x27;s the assassination of democracy&quot;.

The former secretary general of the UN Ban Ki-moon condemned the double murder and insisted on an investigation into the deaths while offering condolences to the nation.

The African Union called the killing a criminal act and the European Union and United States also condemned Vieira&#x27;s murder.

Socialist International, of which Vieira&#x27;s party is a member, stated &quot;The International has followed with great concern the recent political difficulties in Guinea-Bissau and reiterates its firm view that there never can be any justification for the use of force to resolve political disputes and that political assassination is a completely heinous and criminal act.&quot;Library

==Body transferred==
In November 2020, at the initiative of President Umaro Sissoco Embaló, Vieira&#x27;s body was reinterred in the bow declaring that the late president is the national heritage of Guinea Bissau. The corpse was again buried in the Fortaleza de São José da Amura along with other heads of state such as Malam Bacai Sanhá and Kumba Ialá, in the fortress where the General Staff of the Guinea-Bissau Armed Forces works.

<text>The Great Orme () is a limestone headland on the north coast of Wales, north-west of the town of Llandudno. Referred to as &quot;Cyngreawdr Fynydd&quot; by the 12th-century poet Gwalchmai ap Meilyr, its English name derives from the Old Norse word for sea serpent. The Little Orme, a smaller but very similar limestone headland, is on the eastern side of Llandudno Bay. The headland is a tourist attraction, with a Victorian tramway, a cableway, walking routes and a mining museum.

==Toponym ==

Both the Great and Little Ormes have been etymologically linked to the Old Norse words &quot;urm&quot; or &quot;orm&quot; that mean sea serpent (English &quot;worm&quot; is a cognate). One explanation is that the Great Orme is the head, with its body being the land between the Great and Little Ormes, whilst another, possibly more likely, is that the shape of the Great Orme viewed as one enters the isthmus of Llandudno from the southeast landward end resembles a giant sleeping creature. The Vikings left no written texts of their time in North Wales although they certainly raided the area. They did not found any permanent settlements, unlike on the Wirral Peninsula, but some Norse names remain in use in the former Kingdom of Gwynedd (such as Point of Ayr near Talacre).

Despite there being a theory for the origin of the name &quot;Orme&quot;, the word was not commonly used until after the creation of the Victorian resort of Llandudno in the mid-19th century. Before this, Welsh names were predominantly used locally and in cartography to name the headland&#x27;s landward features and the surrounding area. The entire peninsula on which Llandudno was built was known as the Creuddyn (the medieval name of the cwmwd – a historical division of land in Wales); the headland itself was called Y Gogarth or Pen y Gogarth; its promontories were Pen trwyn, Llech, and Trwyn y Gogarth.

Orme only appears to have been applied to the headland as seen from the sea. In 1748, the &quot;Plan of the Bay &amp; Harbour of Conway in Caernarvon Shire&quot; by Lewis Morris names the body of the peninsula &quot;CREUDDYN&quot; but applies the name &quot;Orme&#x27;s Head&quot; to the headland&#x27;s north-westerly seaward point. The first series Ordnance Survey map (published in 1841 and before the establishment of Llandudno) follows this convention. The headland is called the &quot;Great Orme&#x27;s Head&quot; but its landward features all have Welsh names. It is likely that Orme became established as its common name due to Llandudno&#x27;s burgeoning tourist trade because a majority of visitors and holidaymakers arrived by sea. The headland was the first sight of their destination in the three-hour journey from Liverpool by paddle steamer.

==Natural history==
Parts of the Great Orme are managed as a nature reserve by the Conwy County Borough Countryside Service. The area, which is long by wide, has a number of protective designations including Special Area of Conservation, Heritage Coast, Country Park, and Site of Special Scientific Interest. The local authority provides a warden service on the Great Orme that regularly patrols the special scientific and conservation areas. There are numerous maintained paths for walking to the summit; a section of the long-distance North Wales Path also crosses the headland. About half the Great Orme is in use as farmland, mostly for sheep grazing. In 2015, the National Trust purchased the summit&#x27;s Parc Farm for £1million.

===Geology===
The Great Orme is a peninsula made mostly of limestone and dolomite, formed during the Early Carboniferous part of the Earth&#x27;s geological history. Most of the Great Orme&#x27;s rocks are between 339 and 326 million years old. The upper surface of the Great Orme is particularly noted for its limestone pavements covering several headland areas. There are also rich seams of dolomite-hosted copper ore. The Great Orme copper mine was estimated to have produced enough copper to make about 2,000 tons of bronze during the Bronze Age.
The slopes of the Great Orme are subject to occasional subsidence.

===Wells===

Natural wells were greatly prized in limestone districts and the Great Orme was no exception. Water was required for copper mining purposes as well as for domestic and agricultural use. The following Great Orme wells are known and most still supply running water:

*Ffynnon Llygaid. Possibly one of the wells supplying the needs of the once populous Gogarth community before much of it was lost to coastal erosion.
*Ffynnon Gogarth. The main water source for Gogarth and in the later 18th and early 19th centuries the power source to operate the famous Tom and Gerry engine that through a long series of Brammock rods powered the mine water pumps at the Higher shaft near the summit above Pyllau.
*Ffynnon Powel. One of the water supplies together with ffynnon Tudno and ffynnon Rufeining serving the medieval farming community of Cyngreawdr.
*Ffynnon Galchog. This well, near Mynydd Isaf, to the north of Pen Dinas, is a source of lime-rich water known for its petrifying qualities, it is one of two wells known to have been used in the washing of copper ores.
*Ffynnon Tudno. Situated beyond the road, near the northeast corner of St Tudno&#x27;s Church, ffynnon Tudno was, together with ffynnon Rufeining, a principal source of water for the community settled around the church.
*Ffynnon Rufeining. Translated as &quot;Roman Well&quot;, it takes its name from the tradition that Roman copper miners used its waters to wash the copper ores mined nearby.
*Ffynnon Llech. A spring of water in Ogof Llech, a cave on the headland which is very difficult to access. It is claimed to have been used as a hermitage by Saint Tudno, a sixth-century monk of Bangor-is-y-Coed who established the first church here.
*Ffynnon Gaseg. Literally &quot;Mare&#x27;s well&quot;, this spring was revealed at the side of the road, about halfway round and near the highest point, during the construction of the Marine Drive in the 19th century. It was ideally situated to refresh the horses on the five-mile carriage drive round the base of the Great Orme.

===Flora===

The Great Orme has a very rich flora, including most notably the only known site of the critically endangered wild cotoneaster (&quot;Cotoneaster cambricus&quot;), of which only six wild plants are known. Many of the flowers growing in shallow lime-rich earth on the headland have developed from the alpine sub-Arctic species that developed following the last ice-age. Spring and early summer flowers include bloody cranesbill, thrift and sea campion, clinging to the sheer rock face, while pyramidal orchid, common rockrose and wild thyme carpet the grassland. The old mines and quarries also provide suitable habitat for species of plants including spring squill growing on the old copper workings. The white horehound (&quot;Marrubium vulgare&quot;), which is found growing on the westernmost slopes of the Orme is said to have been used, and perhaps cultivated, by 14th-century monks, no doubt to make herbal remedies including cough mixtures. The rare horehound plume moth (&quot;Wheeleria spilodactylus&quot;) lays her eggs amongst the silky leaves and its caterpillars rely for food solely upon this one plant.

===Fauna===
The headland is the habitat of several endangered species of butterflies and moths, including the silky wave, the silver-studded blue (&quot;Plebejus argus&quot; subsp. &quot;caernesis&quot;) and the grayling (&quot;Hipparchia semele thyone&quot;) These last two have adapted to the Great Orme by appearing earlier in the year to take advantage of the limestone flowers and grasses. Also they are smaller than in other parts of the country and are recognised as a definite subspecies. The Great Orme is reported as the northernmost known habitat within Britain for several &#x27;southern&#x27; species of spider notably: &quot;Segestria bavarica&quot;, &quot;Episinus truncatus&quot;, &quot;Micrargus laudatus&quot;, &quot;Drassyllus praeficus&quot;, &quot;Liocranum rupicola&quot; and &quot;Ozyptila scabricula&quot;.
The headland is also home to about 200 Kashmir goats. The herd, which has roamed the Orme since the middle of the 19th century, is descended from a pair of goats that were presented by the Shah of Persia to Queen Victoria shortly after her coronation in 1837. Numbers are controlled by compulsory sterilization; the action was taken because competition for resources was forcing goats off the Orme into gardens and property. The Royal Welsh, a large regiment in the British Army, is permitted by the British monarch to choose an animal from the herd to be a regimental goat (if it passes selection, it is given the honorary rank of lance corporal). During the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Wales, goats began entering the town because of the lack of people; at the same time, the goat population on the Orme grew rapidly because park wardens were unable to administer sterilisation injections. With the end of the pandemic, the town council has created a special task force to manage goat numbers.

The caves and abandoned mine workings are home to large colonies of the rare horseshoe bat. This small flying mammal navigates the caves and tunnels by using echolocation to obtain a mental picture of its surroundings. During the daytime, horseshoe bats are found suspended from the roof of tunnels and caves, with their wings tightly wrapped around their bodies. Only at dusk do the bats leave the caves and mine shafts, to feed on beetles and moths.

The cliffs are host to colonies of seabirds (such as guillemots, kittiwakes, razorbills and even fulmars as well as gulls). The Great Orme is also home to many resident and migrant land birds including ravens, little owls and peregrine falcons. The Red-billed Chough is occasionally spotted.

Below the cliffs, the rock-pools around the headland are a rich and varied habitat for aquatic plants and animals including barnacles, red beadlet anemones and hermit crab

==History==

===Copper mines===

Large-scale human activity on the Great Orme began around 4,000 years ago during the Bronze Age with the opening of several copper mines. The copper ore malachite was mined using stones and bone tools. It is estimated that up to 1,760 tonnes of copper was mined during the period. The mine was most productive in the period between 1700BC and 1400BC, after which most of the readily accessible copper had been extracted. The site was so productive that by 1600BC, there were no other copper mines left open in Britain because they could not compete with the Great Orme.

The mine was abandoned and evidence suggests it was not worked again until the late 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Mining began in the late 17th century due to the demand for copper and improved ability to pump water out of the mine. A steam engine was introduced in 1832 and ten years later an 822-metre long tunnel was mined at sea level to drain the deeper mine workings. Commercial-scale mining on the Great Orme ended in the 1850s, although small-scale mining continued until the mines were finally abandoned in 1881.

In 1987, the improvement of the derelict mine site was commissioned by the local council and Welsh Development Agency. The area was to be landscaped and turned into a car park. Since excavation began in 1987, over of prehistoric tunnels have been discovered. It is estimated that less than half of the prehistoric tunnels have been discovered so far.

In April 1991 the Great Orme Mines site was opened to the public. Pathways and viewing platforms were constructed to give access to the surface excavations. In 1996 a bridge was erected over the top of Vivian&#x27;s Shaft. The visitor centre&#x27;s extension, built-in 2014, contains a selection of mining tools and bronze axes along with displays about life and death in the Bronze Age, mining and ancient metallurgy. Also accessible is the 3,500-year-old Great Cavern.

===Medieval period===

The medieval parish of Llandudno comprised three townships all established on the lower slopes of the Great Orme. The township of &quot;Y Gogarth&quot; at the south-western &#x27;corner&#x27; of the Great Orme was latterly the smallest but it contained the palace of the Bishop of Bangor. The Manor of Gogarth (which included all three townships) had been bestowed on Anian, Bishop of Bangor by King Edward I in 1284 in recognition of services rendered to the crown, notably the baptism of the first English Prince of Wales, newly born at Caernarfon. The palace was burnt down by Owain Glyndŵr in 1400 and the ruins have mostly been washed away together with much of the township by coastal erosion in the Conwy Estuary.
The significant agricultural yet north-facing township of &quot;Cyngreawdr&quot; includes the original parish church and rectory of St Tudno, a sixth- or seventh-century foundation. Following the Glyndŵr uprising, the villagers of the Creuddyn peninsula were harshly taxed and by 1507 they had nearly all fled their homes. Henceforth the cultivated land lay fallow and is now grazed by sheep and goats. Llandudno&#x27;s Victorian cemetery, which is still in regular use, was laid out in 1859 adjacent to the 12th-century church of Saint Tudno where open-air services are held every Sunday morning in summer. Nearby are several large ancient stones that have become shrouded in folklore and also an unexplained stone-lined avenue called &quot;Hwylfa&#x27;r Ceirw&quot; leading towards &quot;Cilfin Ceirw&quot; (Precipice of Deer).

The third township was &quot;Yn Wyddfid&quot; clustered below the Iron Age hill fort of Pen y Dinas at the northeastern &quot;corner&quot; of the Great Orme. With the reopening of the copper mines from the 18th century onwards, this township grew considerably in size with the streets and cottages of the mining village laid out on the largely abandoned agricultural holdings.

===Victorian expansion===
In 1825 the Board of the Port of Liverpool obtained a local act of Parliament, the Liverpool Improvement Act 1825 (6 Geo. 4. c. clxxxvii) to help improve safety and communications for the merchant marine operating in the Irish Sea and Liverpool Bay. The act allowed them to erect and maintain telegraph stations between Liverpool and the Isle of Anglesey. This would help ship-owners, merchants and port authorities in Liverpool know the location of all mercantile shipping along the North Wales coast.

In 1826 the summit of the Great Orme was chosen as the location for one of the 11 optical semaphore stations that would form an unbroken chain from Liverpool to Holyhead. The original semaphore station on the Orme, which consisted of small building with living accommodation, used a ship&#x27;s mast with three pairs of moveable arms to send messages to either Puffin Island to the west or to Llysfaen in the east. Skilled telegraphers could send semaphore messages between Liverpool and Holyhead in under a minute.

In March 1855 the Great Orme telegraph station was converted to electric telegraph. Landlines and submarine cables connected the Orme to Liverpool and Holyhead. At first the new equipment was installed in the original Semaphore Station on the summit until it was moved down to the Great Orme lighthouse in 1859. Two years later the Great Orme semaphore station closed with the completion of a direct electric telegraph connection from Liverpool to Holyhead.

By the late 1860s, Llandudno&#x27;s blossoming tourist trade saw many Victorians visit the old semaphore station at the summit to enjoy the panorama. This led to the development of the summit complex.

=== Twentieth century ===
By the early 20th century, a nine-bed hotel was built on the site. It served as the clubhouse for the Great Orme Golf Club that was founded in the early 1900s. The course closed in 1939 and is now a sheep farm. 

On 11 July 1914, Beatrice Blore drove a Singer Ten car up the cable track of the Great Orme, with a gradient of 1 in 3 in places, becoming the first woman to drive up the steep and challenging headland. She was six months pregnant at the time and the drive was a publicity stunt developed by her partner George Wilkin Browne to help sell the cars at his Llandudno garage, North Wales Silver Motors. Her feat is commemorated by her unusual gravestone in St Tudno&#x27;s graveyard.

During the Second World War, the RAF built a Chain Home Low radar station at the summit. In 1952 the site was taken into private ownership until it was acquired by Llandudno Urban Town Council in 1961.

===Second World War===

The Royal Artillery coast artillery school was transferred from Shoeburyness to the Great Orme in 1940 (and additionally a Practice Camp was established on the Little Orme in 1941) during the Second World War. Target practice was undertaken from the headland to both towed and anchored boats. Experimental work and training was also provided for radio direction finding. The foundations of some of the buildings and installations remain and can be seen from the western end of Marine Drive. The site of the school was scheduled as an Ancient Monument in 2011 by CADW, the Welsh Government&#x27;s historic monuments body. This was done in recognition of the site&#x27;s significance in a UK and Welsh context.

Also of note was the Aerial Defence Research and Development Establishment (ADRDE) known as &quot;X3&quot; which was a three-storey building erected in 1942. This seems to have been a secret radar experimental station above the artillery school. The road put in to serve it now serves a car park on the approximate site of the station, which was demolished in 1956.

==Tourism==

With the creation of Llandudno, the first route round the perimeter of the Great Orme was a footpath constructed in 1858 by Reginald Cust, a trustee of the Mostyn Estate. In 1872 the Great Ormes Head Marine Drive Co. Ltd. was formed to turn the path into a Victorian carriage road. But it went bankrupt before work was finished. A second company completed the road in 1878. The contractors for the scheme were Messrs Hughes, Morris, Davies, a consortium led by Richard Hughes of Madoc Street, Llandudno. The road was bought by Llandudno Urban District Council in 1897. The one-way toll road starts at the foot of the Happy Valley. After about a side road leads to St. Tudno&#x27;s Church, the Bronze Age Copper Mines and to the Great Orme Summit complex with car park. The toll road ticket also pays for the parking at the Summit Complex. Marine Drive has been used as a stage on the Wales Rally GB in 1981, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2018.

In 1902, the Great Orme Tramway was built to convey visitors to the top of the Great Orme. In 1969, the Llandudno Cable Car was also constructed to take visitors up to the summit attractions. These include a tourist shop, cafeteria, visitors&#x27; centre, play areas, a licensed hotel, and the vintage tram/cable-car stations.

On clear days Winter Hill, the Isle of Man and the Lake District can be seen from the summit of the Orme.

The Orme has one of only two artificial ski slopes in North Wales, complete with one of the longest toboggan runs in the United Kingdom.

Landscaped gardens in the Happy Valley and terraces in the Haulfre Garden cover the lower landward facing steeply sloping southern side. Walkways link the Haulfre Gardens with the western end of the Marine Drive.

On the northernmost point of the Orme is the former Llandudno lighthouse. It was constructed in 1862 by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. The navigation aid remained in continuous use until 22 March 1985 when it was decommissioned. The building has now been converted into a small bed &amp; breakfast guest house. The lantern and its optics are now on permanent display at the Summit Complex visitors&#x27; centre. The old established &quot;Rest and be thankful&quot; café is also nearby.

<doc id="754984" wikidata="Q713231" url="?curid=754984" title="Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars">
<text>Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars (; 1620 – 12 September 1642) was a favourite of King Louis XIII of France, who led the last and most nearly successful of many conspiracies against the Cardinal Richelieu, the king&#x27;s powerful first minister.
==Life==
Cinq-Mars was the son of Marshal Antoine Coiffier de Ruzé, marquis d&#x27;Effiat, a close friend of Cardinal Richelieu, who took the boy under his protection on his father&#x27;s death in 1632.

=== Career ===
As the son of the marquis d&#x27;Effiat, a famous Superintendent of Finances who was also a good friend of Richelieu&#x27;s, Cinq-Mars came to court very early.

In 1639, after the exile of the royal favourite Marie de Hautefort, Richelieu introduced the young Cinq-Mars to Louis, hoping he would find favour with the king, thus allowing Richelieu to exercise even greater control over the king. Cinq-Mars indeed quickly established himself as a royal favourite, and was raised to Grand Squire of France. The cardinal believed he could easily control Cinq-Mars, but instead Cinq-Mars pressed the king for important favours and tried to convince the king to have Richelieu executed. 

In 1641, Cinq-Mars was active in the Comte de Soissons&#x27; rebellion, but the effort failed. The next year, he conspired again with the king&#x27;s brother, Gaston, Duke of Orleans, to try to get support for the rebellion from Philip IV, the king of Spain; Richelieu&#x27;s spy service caught him doing so. 

Consequently, Richelieu had Cinq-Mars imprisoned and beheaded in the Place des Terreaux in Lyon, along with his accomplice, François Auguste de Thou. The French writer, Tallemant, relates that the king showed no emotions concerning the execution: he said &quot;&quot;Je voudrais bien voir la grimace qu&#x27;il fait à cette heure sur cet échafaud&quot; (&#x27;I would like to see the grimace he is now making on this scaffold&#x27;). The Marquis of Cinq-Mars&#x27; last words were, &quot;Mon Dieu! Qu’est-ce que ce monde&quot;&quot; (&#x27;My God! What is this world?&#x27;)

==In popular culture==
Alfred de Vigny wrote a novel &quot;Cinq-Mars&quot;, inspired by the story of the marquis, and published in 1826. Charles Gounod wrote an opera of the same name which premiered on April 5, 1877. Barbara Strozzi composed a cantata about the execution of the marquis (&quot;Il lamento sul Rodano severo&quot;).

A famous historical painting by Paul Delaroche shows Cardinal Richelieu in a gorgeous barge, preceding the boat carrying Cinq-Mars and De Thou to their execution.

Historical accounts are Jeanne-Pauline Basserie, &quot;La conjuration de Cinq-Mars&quot; (Paris, 1896) and Anaïs Bazin, &quot;Histoire de France sous Louis XIII&quot; (Paris).

<doc id="755008" wikidata="Q106515071" url="?curid=755008" title="Zoedone">
<text>Zoedone (foaled 1877) was a British-bred Thoroughbred racehorse who won the Grand National in 1883 while being ridden by her owner Count Charles Kinsky.

Zoedone was a chestnut filly and was initially bought as a hunter for £170 by Edward Clayton who quickly saw the racing potential she had and so he entered her into the 1882 Grand National. Clayton asked his experienced jockey friend, Arthur Smith to ride Zoedone. She finished third in bad, rainy and snowy conditions, but she was noted for he sturdiness, jumping ability and stamina. She followed this by winning the Warwick Grand Annual steeplechase.

She was spotted by Count Charles Kinsky while hunting in Melton and the Czech count bought her in late 1882 for £800, with a £200 contingency, should she win the Grand National. Count Kinsky decided to ride her himself and so both himself and Zoedone went to Upton to be trained by Snowy Harding. 

Zoedone and Kinsky went on to win the 1883 Grand National. The race consisted of 10 horses making it the smallest field in Grand National history. In heavy going Kinsky rode Zoedone to an easy victory with the slowest time ever recorded for the Grand National: 11 minutes, 39 seconds. This record would stand for 118 years until Red Marauder ran even slower in 2001.

In 1884 Zoedone was ridden by Kinsky again in the Grand National where she placed fourth. The following year, 1885, she was second favorite but she fell when schooling over a hurdle before the race and then fell at Beachers Brook. Rumours persisted that she had been poisoned.

Zoedone was retired and sent to the Kinsky stud in Europe.

<text>William Freeman Vilas (July 9, 1840August 27, 1908) was an American lawyer, politician, and United States Senator. In the U.S. Senate, he represented the state of Wisconsin for one term, from 1891 to 1897. As a prominent Bourbon Democrat, he was also a member of the cabinet of U.S. President Grover Cleveland, serving as the 33rd Postmaster General and the 17th Secretary of the Interior.

He was a major donor to the University of Wisconsin, leaving $30,000,000 to the school at his death in 1908. He is the namesake of Vilas Hall on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus, as well as Vilas County, Wisconsin, and the towns of Vilas, Colorado, and Vilas, South Dakota.

==Early life and education==
Vilas was born in Chelsea, Vermont, the son of Esther Greene (Smilie) and Levi Baker Vilas, a politician. His grandfather was Nathan Smilie, a Democratic politician who ran for Governor of Vermont in 1839. Vilas moved to Madison, Wisconsin with his family in 1851. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1858, and from the Albany Law School in 1860.

==Career==
He enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War and was a captain in the 23rd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment and later served as the lieutenant colonel of that regiment.

Following the war, Vilas was a Professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and a regent of the University from 1880 to 1885 and 1898 to 1905. Vilas served as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1885, until he was appointed the Postmaster General between 1885 and 1888, and as Secretary of the Interior from 1888 to 1889, both under President Grover Cleveland.

After leaving the cabinet, he led Wisconsin German Americans in the protest against the Bennett Law of 1889 which required schools to only use the English language. From 1891 until 1897, he was a member of the United States Senate, in which, during President Cleveland&#x27;s second term, he was recognized as the chief defender of the Administration, and he was especially active in securing the repeal of the silver purchase clause of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. He was unsuccessful in an 1896 reelection bid, having been defeated by Senator John Coit Spooner, who held the seat before him and whom Vilas had defeated for reelection in 1890.

Vilas was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention of 1896, but withdrew after the adoption of the free-silver plank. He then became one of the chief organizers of the National Democratic Party, attended the convention at Indianapolis, and was chairman of its committee on resolutions. He was also the main drafter of the National Democratic Party&#x27;s platform. Vilas, a favorite of the delegates, refused to run as the party&#x27;s sacrificial lamb.

Back in Wisconsin, he was from 1897 to 1903 a member of the commission that had charge of the erection of the State Historical Library at Madison, and from 1906 to 1908 of the commission for the construction of the new state capitol.

==Personal life==
He married Anna M. Fox, who had been born in the territory of Wisconsin. Their younger son, Levi Baker, died in early childhood and their elder daughter, Nellie, died in 1893. Their older son, Henry, died in 1899 at the age of 27 from complications related to diabetes.

William and Anna were survived by their younger daughter Mary Esther.
He is interred at the Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin.

===Legacy===
Vilas County, Wisconsin, is named for William F. Vilas. Senator Vilas is also the namesake of the towns of Vilas, Colorado and Vilas, South Dakota. His childhood home in Madison is located in what is now the Langdon Street Historic District. His family donated land to the city of Madison to build a public park, which later became a part of the Henry Vilas Zoo.

<text>Oswald Garrison Villard (March 13, 1872 – October 1, 1949) was an American journalist and editor of the &quot;New York Evening Post.&quot; He was a civil rights activist, and along with his mother, Fanny Villard, a founding member of the NAACP. In 1913, he wrote to President Woodrow Wilson to protest his administration&#x27;s racial segregation of federal offices in Washington, D.C., a change from previous integrated conditions. He was a leading liberal spokesman in the 1920s and 1930s, then turned to the right.

Villard was a founder of the American Anti-Imperialist League, favoring independence for territories taken in the Spanish–American War. He provided a rare direct link between the anti-imperialism of the late 19th century and the conservative Old Right of the 1930s and 1940s.

==Early life and career==
Villard was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, on March 13, 1872, while his parents were living there. He was the son of Henry Villard, an American newspaper correspondent who had been an immigrant from Germany, and Fanny (Garrison) Villard, daughter of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Fanny Villard was a suffragist and one of the founders of the Women&#x27;s Peace Movement. His father later invested in railroads, and bought &quot;The Nation&quot; and the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; in 1881. The family returned to the United States soon after Villard&#x27;s birth, settling in New York City in 1876.

Villard graduated from Harvard University in 1893 and, after touring Europe with his father for a year, returned to Harvard to earn his graduate degree in American history. He served as a teaching assistant, and could have pursued a career in academia, but desired a more active life. 
In 1896 he joined the staff of &quot;The Philadelphia Press,&quot; but disliked the paper&#x27;s pandering to advertisers. He soon joined the staff of his father&#x27;s &quot;Evening Post&quot;, serving as the editor of the Saturday features page. He began to write regularly for the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;, and said that he and his fellow staff members were

... radical on peace and war and on the Negro question; radical in our insistence that the United States stay at home and not go to war abroad and impose its imperialistic will upon Latin-American republics, often with great slaughter. We were radical in our demand for free trade and our complete opposition to the whole protective system.

==Advocacy and activism==
Villard was also a founder of the American Anti-Imperialist League, which favored independence for the territories captured in the Spanish–American War. To further the cause, he worked to organize &quot;a third ticket&quot; in 1900 to challenge William Jennings Bryan and William McKinley. He was joined in this effort by several key veterans of the 1896 National Democratic Party. Not surprisingly, Villard made a personal appeal to ex-president Grover Cleveland, a hero of the gold Democrats, urging him to be the candidate. Cleveland demurred, asserting that voters no longer cared what he had to say. Villard also consistently used the editorial page of the &quot;Evening Post&quot; to argue against imperialism and expansionism.

In 1910, he donated space in the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; for the &quot;call&quot; to the meeting that formally organized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Villard became a co-founder of the organization, along with W. E. B. Du Bois and other influential individuals. For many years, Villard served as the NAACP&#x27;s disbursing treasurer while Moorfield Storey, another Cleveland Democrat, was its president.

Villard supported Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 election, and during an interview with the president convinced Wilson to work to improve conditions for African Americans. He protested by writing to Wilson in July 1913 about his administration&#x27;s segregation of federal offices in the capital, a change from previous practice. Booker T. Washington appealed to Villard to get Wilson to change his policy. Wilson defended these policies and did little to help blacks during his administrations. Although many African Americans had crossed party lines to vote for him, few were appointed to higher level civil service positions. In addition, Wilson did nothing to encourage the end of disenfranchisement of blacks in the South by Democratic-dominated legislatures, which had largely excluded African Americans there from the political system. Consequently, Villard turned against the president, endorsing his opponents and editorializing against him in the &quot;Evening Post&quot; and the &quot;Nation&quot;.

Villard opposed Wilson&#x27;s plan for the League of Nations, and in 1921 was speaking in Cincinnati, Ohio when a violent mob attempted to disrupt a speech against the League.

In 1910, Villard published &quot;John Brown 1800-1859: A Biography Fifty Years After&quot;, which portrayed Brown as an inspiring American hero. It was praised by reviewers for its unbiased tone and use of new information.

Villard also wrote &quot;Germany Embattled&quot; (1915), in which he urged readers to acknowledge German contributions to American life and described the political divide in Germany. He reminded readers that the Germans believed in their cause, and advocated for continued neutrality in the European conflict. Villard followed this with two further studies of Germany: &quot;The German Phoenix: The Story of the Republic&quot; (1933) and &quot;Inside Germany; with an Epilogue, England at War&quot; (1939; reprinted as &quot;Within Germany&quot;, 1940). Villard used the former to examine postwar German contributions to art, politics, journalism, education and morality. His third book discussed Adolf Hitler&#x27;s brutal Nazi policies and the plight of German civilians.

Villard wrote many books critical of journalists and newspapers. His stated goal was to improve journalistic standards, which he believed had succumbed to big business and diminishing integrity. He felt that his contemporaries were sacrificing integrity for monetary contributions from businesses and politicians. He also published many of his articles and addresses on a wide range of subjects including militarism, music, the Garrison family, and racial discrimination. Finally, Villard published an account of his father&#x27;s early obstacles and accomplishments. He also wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Fighting Years: Memoirs of a Liberal Editor,&quot; which was well-reviewed and celebrated.

==Liberal spokesman==

While Villard continued to champion civil liberties, civil rights, and anti-imperialism after World War I, he largely abandoned his previous belief in laissez-faire economics. During the 1930s, he welcomed the advent of the New Deal and called for nationalization of major industries. In 1943, he engaged in a debate with philosopher Ayn Rand on the topic of collectivism versus individualism, sponsored by the American Economic Association, which was published in a number of newspapers.

==Conservative spokesman==

Always independent-minded, however, he bitterly dissented from the foreign policy of the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the late 1930s. He was an early member of the non-interventionist America First Committee which opposed U.S. entry into World War II, and used the editorial page of &quot;The Nation&quot; to express his views:

No, the truth is that if reason and logic, and not sentiment, hysteria, and self-interest, were applied to this question, the American army and navy would take the lead in advocating disarmament—always provided that we are not going to be so insane as to go to war in Europe again. I am even hoping that my friends the editors of &quot;The Nation&quot; will now turn about and join me in exposing the needless waste of the terrific military expenditures we are now making, to say nothing of the steady militarization of the country.

He broke completely with &quot;The Nation&quot;, which he had sold in 1935 because it supported American intervention. At the same time, he became increasingly repelled by the New Deal bureaucratic state, which he condemned as a precursor to American fascism. Also, he deplored the air raids carried out by the allies in the later years of World War II, saying:

What was criminal in Coventry, Rotterdam, Warsaw and London has now become heroic in Dresden and now Tokyo.

After 1945, Villard made common cause with &quot;old right&quot; conservatives, such as Senator Robert A. Taft, Felix Morley, and John T. Flynn, against the Cold War policies of Harry S. Truman.

Villard suffered a heart attack in 1944 and sustained a stroke five years later. He died on October 1, 1949, in New York City.

==Family and legacy==

His oldest son, Henry Hilgard Villard, was head of the economics department at the City College of New York and the first male president of Planned Parenthood of New York City. His youngest son, Oswald Garrison Villard, Jr., was a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University. His daughter, Dorothy Villard Hammond, was a member of the American University in Cairo.

On February 21, 2009, the US Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Villard&#x27;s civil rights work.

<doc id="755048" wikidata="Q1636226" url="?curid=755048" title="Neolithic long house">
<text>The Neolithic long house was a long, narrow timber dwelling built by the Old Europeans in Europe beginning at least as early as the period 6000 to 5000 BC. They first appeared in central Europe in connection with the early Neolithic cultures such as the Linear Pottery culture or Cucuteni culture. This type of architecture represents the largest free-standing structure in the world in its era. Long houses are present across numerous regions and time periods in the archaeological record.

The long house was a rectangular structure, wide, of variable length, around up to . Outer walls were wattle and daub, sometimes alternating with split logs, with pitched, thatched roofs, supported by rows of poles, three across. The exterior walls would have been quite short beneath the large roof. They were solid and massive, oak posts being preferred. Clay for the daub was dug from pits near the house, which were then used for storage. Houses in the urban settlements had two stories, with up to three or even four floors on each story. Some Linear Pottery culture houses were occupied for as long as 30 years.

Some houses were especially spacious, extra large for the period, as one of the largest houses in southeastern Europe is the &quot;Big House&quot; in the Slatina district of Sofia in Bulgaria equivalent to a modern detached house.

Surviving evidence suggests these houses had no windows and only one doorway. The door was located at one end of the house. Internally, the house had one or two partitions creating up to three areas. Interpretations of the use of these areas vary. Working activities might be carried out in the better lit door end, the middle used for sleeping and eating and the end farthest from the door could have been used for grain storage. According to another view, the interior was divided in areas for sleeping, common life and a fenced enclosure at the back end for keeping animals.

Twenty or thirty people could have lived in each house, with villages composed typically of five to eight houses. Exceptionally, nearly 30 longhouses in a fortified settlement (dating to 4300 BC, i.e., Late Linear Pottery culture) were revealed by excavations at Oslonki in Poland.

== Examples ==
The Balbridie timber house in what is present day Aberdeenshire, Scotland, offers an outstanding example of these early timber structures. Archaeological excavations have revealed extant timber postholes that delineate the support pieces of the original structure. This site is strategically located in a fertile agricultural area along the River Dee, very close to an ancient strategic ford of the river and also near an ancient timber trackway known as the Elsick Mounth.

<doc id="755049" wikidata="Q2726364" url="?curid=755049" title="Satguru">
<text>Satguru (), or sadguru (), means a &quot;true guru&quot; in Sanskrit. The term is distinguished from other forms of gurus, such as musical instructors, scriptural teachers, parents, and so on. A &quot;satguru&quot; has some special characteristics that are not found in any other types of spiritual guru. &quot;Satguru&quot; is a title given specifically only to an enlightened &quot;rishi&quot; or &quot;sant&quot; whose life&#x27;s purpose is to guide the initiated &quot;shishya&quot; on the spiritual path, the summation of which is the realization of the Self through realization of God.

== Hinduism ==
According to Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, a Hindu &quot;satguru&quot; is always a &quot;sannyasin&quot;, an unmarried renunciate, but not all writers include this stricture. Tukaram, a Hindu &quot;satguru&quot;, is known to have had a family. Satguru Kabir had a son, Kamal, who was very devout.

The words &quot;sant&quot; and &quot;satguru&quot; were prominently used in the spiritual ideology of Kabir in the 15th century. Kabir says &quot;&quot;satpurush ko jansi, Tiska satguru naam&quot;, meaning the one who has seen the supreme lord of truth (&quot;satya purush&quot;) is &quot;satguru&quot;. Kabir wrote &quot;Devi dewal jagat mein, kotik poojey koye. Satguru ki pooja kiye, sabb ki pooja hoye&quot;&quot;, meaning that worship of &quot;satguru&quot; includes in it worship of all deities. In other words, &quot;satguru&quot; is the physical form of God (&quot;sat purusha&quot;).

In one of Kabir&#x27;s songs the &quot;satguru&quot; is described as the real &quot;sadhu&quot;:
Vasishtha, Rama&#x27;s guru, was the &quot;satguru&quot; in the Treta Yuga. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha quoted the &quot;Yoga Vasistha&quot; regarding the &quot;real preceptor&quot; (&quot;satguru&quot;):

In Sant Mat and Advait Mat, the living &quot;satguru&quot; is considered the path to God-realization.

== Sikhism ==
In Sikh philosophy, Nanak, defines &quot;satguru&quot; as truth itself and not a physical entity. This truth emanates from reality and requires no blind faith. In the Japji Sahib he writes &quot;Ek onkar, satguru prasad&quot;, which means &quot;there is one creator, [this knowledge I have learned] by the grace of God&quot;. The Sikh (student) learns from reality as presented by the creator. Truth (&quot;sat&quot;) itself is the teacher (guru).

The recommendation says that the first and the foremost qualification of the &quot;satguru&quot; is that he must have known the True Lord (God) himself.

== Syncretic traditions ==
Meher Baba equated worship of the &quot;satguru&quot; with worship of God:
According to Dada Bhagwan, a &quot;satguru&quot; must maintain self-knowledge:
== Satsang ==
A &quot;satsang&quot; is an audience with a &quot;satguru&quot; for religious instruction. The name &quot;satsang&quot; is a Sanskrit word that means &quot;gathering together for the truth&quot; or, more simply, &quot;being with the truth&quot;. Truth is what is real, what exists.

<text>A longhouse or long house is a type of long, proportionately narrow, single-room building for communal dwelling. It has been built in various parts of the world including Asia, Europe, and North America.

Many were built from timber and often represent the earliest form of permanent structure in many cultures. Types include the Neolithic long house of Europe, the Norman Medieval Longhouses that evolved in Western Britain (&quot;Tŷ Hir&quot;) and Northern France (&quot;Longère&quot;), and the various types of longhouse built by different cultures among the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

== Europe ==
The Neolithic long house type was introduced with the first farmers of Central and Western Europe around 5000 BCE, 7,000 years ago. These were farming settlements built in groups of six to twelve longhouses; they were home to large extended families and kin.

The Germanic cattle-farmer longhouses emerged along the southwestern North Sea coast in the third or fourth century BCE and may be the ancestors of several medieval house types such as the Scandinavian &quot;langhus&quot;; the English, Welsh, and Scottish longhouse variants; and the German and Dutch Low German house. The longhouse is a traditional form of shelter.

Some of the medieval longhouse types of Europe that have survived are the following:
=== Dartmoor longhouse ===
The Western Brittonic &quot;Dartmoor longhouse&quot; variants in Devon, Cornwall, and Wales, where it is known as the &quot;Tŷ Hir&quot;, are often typified by the use of cruck construction. It is built along a slope, and a single passage gives access to both human and animal shelter under a single roof.

There are dozens of pre-1600 longhouses remaining on Exmoor and the surrounding area. Some can be dated using dendrochronology to before 1400, but sites can be much older and have names with a Saxon origin. Longhouses on Exmoor are typically a single-story building, one room deep, laid out as two crucked bays a cross passage and two crucked bays. As glass was not available until the middle of the 16th century, they were oriented loosely East West with openings (for a door and latticed unglazed windows) only in the south wall to provide the maximum shelter from the worst weather and catch the sun. 

They are often dug into the hillside, the lower parts of the walls are formed from rough stone in mud pointing with cob above, as before the 17th century lime cement was virtually unknown.The floors were not made a true level. Livestock used the lower end. A hole is often provided in the base of the end wall for mucking out. The cross passage (often misnamed as a breezeway did not pass right through the building) establishes distinct areas for people in one half of the house and livestock in the other, but would only be needed for a couple of months at most in the winter. There was a fire pit, sometimes with a stone reredos (as in Hendre’r-ywydd Uchaf Farmhouse, Denbighshire), behind which the smoke rose to the eaves and passed through the thatch.

As skills and wealth increased, after 1500 many had built in settles, most by 1700 would have been adapted and have: separate buildings for livestock, a second storey, stairways, a chimney with bread oven, an outshut (pantry/larder/dairy which was only accessible from inside the house), glazed windows, lime screed floors and at least some decorative plasterwork.

=== Other European longhouses ===
Other European longhouse types include the northwest England type in Cumbria, the Scottish longhouse, &quot;blackhouse&quot; or &quot;taighean-dubha,&quot; and the Scandinavian or Viking &quot;Langhus/Långhus&quot; and mead hall.

The Western French longhouse or &quot;maison longue&quot; from Lower Brittany, Normandy, Mayenne, Anjou (also in the Cantal, Lozère and the Pyrenees Ariège), is very similar to the western British type with shared livestock quarters and central drain.

The Old Frisian longhouse or &quot;Langhuis&quot; developed into the Frisian farmhouse by integrating a large barn, typical of the Gulf house (German: &quot;Gulfhaus&quot;), which spread since the 16th century from the Southern Netherlands along the North Sea coast to the east and north.

=== Medieval development of the Germanic longhouse ===
Further developments of the Germanic longhouse during the Middle Ages were the Low German house in northern and especially northwestern Germany and its northern neighbour, the Geestharden house in Jutland including Schleswig, with its variant, the Frisian house. With these house types the wooden posts originally rammed into the ground were replaced by posts supported on a base. The large and well-supported attic enabled large quantities of hay or grain to be stored in dry conditions. This development may have been driven because the weather became wetter over time. Good examples of these houses have been preserved, some dating back to the 16th century. The longhouse was 50 to 60 feet long.

== Americas ==

In North America two groups of longhouses emerged: the Native American/First Nations longhouse of the tribes usually connected with the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) in the northeast, and a similarly shaped structure which arose independently among the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast.

The longhouses inhabited by the Iroquois were wood boards/bark-covered structures of standardized design &quot;in the shape of an arbor&quot; about wide providing shelter for several related families. The longhouse had a central aisle and compartments, about long, down each side. The end compartments were usually used for storage. Hearths were spaced about apart down the aisle, with smoke holes in the roof. Two families shared each hearth. Each longhouse would house several generations of an extended family; a house was built proportionately to the number of families it was expected to contain and might be lengthened over time to accommodate growth. It is possible to infer the population of an Iroquois town from the sizes and number of longhouses it contained.
In South America, the Tucano people of Colombia and northwest Brazil traditionally combine a household in a single long house. The Xingu peoples of central Brazil build a series of longhouses in circular formations forming round villages. The ancient Tupi people of the Brazilian coast used to do this as well. The Yanomami people of Brazil and Venezuela build a round hut with a thatched roof that has a hole in the middle, called shabono, which could be considered a sort of longhouse.

== Asia ==

=== Korea ===
In Daepyeong, an archaeological site of the Mumun pottery period in Korea, longhouses have been found that date to circa 1100–850 BC. Their layout seems to be similar to those of the Iroquois. In these, several fireplaces were arranged along the longitudinal axis of the building. Later, the ancient Koreans started raising their buildings on stilts, so that the inner partitions and arrangements are somewhat obscure. The size of the buildings and their placement within the settlements may point to buildings for the nobles of their society or some sort of community or religious buildings. In Igeum-dong, an excavation site in South Korea, the large longhouses, 29 and 26 metres long, are situated between the megalithic cemetery and the rest of the settlement.

=== Taiwan ===
The longhouse may be an old building tradition among the people of Austronesian origin or intensive contact. The Austronesian language group seems to have spread to southeast Asia and the Pacific islands as well as Madagascar from the island of Taiwan. Groups like the Siraya of ancient Taiwan built longhouses and practiced head hunting, as did, for example the later Dayaks of Borneo.

=== Borneo ===

Many of the inhabitants of the Southeast Asian island of Borneo (now Indonesian Kalimantan, East Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam), the Dayak, live traditionally in buildings known as Lamin House or longhouses: &quot;rumah betang&quot; in Indonesia (specifically the western parts of Borneo) and &quot;rumah panjang&quot; in Malay. Common to most of these is that they are built raised off the ground on stilts and are divided into a more or less public area along one side and a row of private living quarters lined along the other side. This seems to have been the way of building best accustomed to life in the jungle in the past, as otherwise hardly related people have come to build their dwellings in similar ways. One may observe similarities to South American jungle villages also living in large single structures. They are raised and built over a hill, flooding presents little inconvenience and the height acts as defence against enemy attacks. Some longhouses are quite large; up to 1152m. The entire architecture is designed and built as a standing tree with branches to the right and left with the front part facing the sunrise while the back faces the sunset. The longhouse building acts as the normal accommodation and a house of worship for religious activities. The entry could double as a canoe dock. Cooling air could circulate underneath the raised floor of the dwelling, and the elevated living areas were more likely to catch above-ground breezes. Livestock could shelter underneath the longhouses for greater protection from predators and the elements. In fact, chickens coops were hung from the main room structure for easy feeding.

Old longhouses in Asia were made of tree trunks as structure members, long leaves as the roof cover, split bamboo or small tree trunks as the flooring and tree bark as the wall coverings. In the past, longhouses were primarily made out of timber sourced from trees such as &quot;Eusideroxylon zwageri&quot; (Bornean ironwood) so the longhouses were able to stand firm and durable. In modern times many of the older longhouses have been replaced with buildings using more modern materials, like brick or cement, but of similar design.

Many place names in Borneo have &quot;Long&quot; in their name (which means river) and most of these are or once were longhouses.

=== Siberut ===
A traditional house type of the Sakuddei people, on the island of Siberut, part of the Mentawai Islands some 130 kilometres (81 mi) to the west off the coast of Sumatra (&quot;Sumatera&quot;), Indonesia is also described as a longhouse on stilts. Some five to ten families may live in each, but they are organized differently inside from those on Borneo. From front to back, such a house, called an &quot;uma&quot;, regularly consists of an open platform serving as the main entrance place, followed by a covered gallery. The inside is divided into two rooms, one behind the other. On the back there is another platform. The whole building is raised on short stilts about half a metre off the ground. The front platform is used for general activities while the covered gallery is the favorite place for the men to host guests, and where the men usually sleep. The following first room is entered by a door and contains a central communal hearth and a place for dancing. There are also places for religious and ritual objects and activities. In the adjoining room the women and their small children as well as unmarried daughters sleep, usually in compartments divided into families. The platform on the back is used by the women for their everyday activities. Visiting women usually enter the house here.

=== Vietnam ===

The Mnong and Rade of Vietnam also have a tradition of building longhouses () that may be long. In contrast to the jungle versions of Borneo these sport shorter stilts and seem to use a veranda in front of a short (gable) side as main entrance.

=== Nepal ===
The Rana Tharu is an ethnic group indigenous to the western Terai of Nepal. Most of them prefer living in longhouses called &quot;Badaghar&quot; with big families of many generations, sometimes 40–50 people. All household members pool their labor force, contribute their income, share the expenditure and use one kitchen. Traditionally, their houses are built entirely using natural materials such as reed poles for walls and thatch for roofing.

<text>Madeleine Vionnet (; June 22, 1876, Loiret, France – March 2, 1975) was a French fashion designer best known for being the “pioneer of the bias cut dress”, Vionnet trained in London before returning to France to establish her first fashion house in Paris in 1912. Although it was forced to close in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War, it re-opened after the war and Vionnet became one of the leading designers of 1920s-30s Paris. Vionnet was forced to close her house again in 1939 at the start of the Second World War and she retired in 1940.

Called &quot;perhaps the greatest geometrician among all French couturiers&quot; in 1925 British Vogue, Vionnet is best known today for her elegant Grecian-style dresses and for popularising the bias cut within the fashion world and is credited with inspiring a number of recent designers.

==Biography ==
Born on 22 June 1876 into a poor family in Chilleurs-aux-Bois, Loiret, Vionnet&#x27;s parents separated when she was very young and she moved with her father, a toll collector, to Aubervilliers at the age of five. Having already left school, Vionnet began her apprenticeship at age twelve as a seamstress alongside members of the garde champêtre. After a brief marriage at age 18 – and the loss of her young child – she left her husband and went to London to work as a hospital seamstress. While in London, Vionnet worked as a fitter for Kate Reily.

Vionnet eventually returned to Paris, working for six years in the fashion house Callot Soeurs as a toile maker. After a disagreement with a manager of the house, Vionnet threatened to leave her post. She was convinced to stay by the eldest of the Callot sisters, Marie Callot Gerber, after being offered a promotion that would mean improvising draped designs on a live model with Gerber herself. Vionnet later praised Marie Callot Gerber as &quot;a great lady&quot; and later remarked that &quot;without the example of the Callot Soeurs, I would have continued to make Fords. It is because of them that I have been able to make Rolls-Royces&quot;. Her desire for simplicity was ultimately at odds with the characteristic lacy frills of the fashion house.

Vionnet designed for Jacques Doucet between 1907 and 1911. Her use of barefoot models and design of loose robes clashed with the style of the house. In 1912 she founded her own fashion house, &quot;Vionnet&quot;, which closed in 1914 owing to the beginning of the First World War. Re-establishing the house in 1923, Vionnet opened new premises on Avenue Montaigne, which became known as the &quot;Temple of Fashion&quot;. In 1925, Vionnet&#x27;s fashion house expanded with premises on Fifth Avenue in New York City. She sold designs purchased off the peg and adapted to the wearer.

Vionnet&#x27;s bias cut clothes dominated haute couture in the 1930s, setting trends with her sensual gowns worn by such internationally known actresses as Marlene Dietrich, Katharine Hepburn, Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo. Her loyal clients included mainly European aristocrats and wealthy North Americans such as the Baroness Robert de Rothschild, Madame Citroën, Mrs Harrison Williams (Mona von Bismarck) and Lady Davis. 

Vionnet&#x27;s vision of the female form revolutionized modern clothing, and the success of her unique cuts assured her reputation. She fought for copyright laws in fashion. She instituted what, at the time, were considered revolutionary labor practices: paid holidays and maternity leave, day-care, a dining hall, and a resident doctor and dentist for her workers. The onset of World War II forced Vionnet to close her fashion house in 1939, and she retired in 1940. Vionnet created some 12,000 garments over the course of her career.

An intensely private individual, Vionnet avoided public displays and mundane frivolities. Despite her success as a designer, she expressed dislike for the world of fashion, stating: &quot;Insofar as one can talk of a Vionnet school, it comes mostly from my having been an enemy of fashion. There is something superficial and volatile about the seasonal and elusive whims of fashion which offends my sense of beauty&quot;. Vionnet was not concerned with being the &quot;designer of the moment&quot;, preferring to remain true to her own vision of female beauty.

== Styles and technique ==
Alongside Coco Chanel, Vionnet is credited with a move away from stiff, formalised clothing to sleeker, softer clothes. Unlike Chanel, Vionnet had little appetite for self-promotion; her retirement in 1940 marginalised her contribution to the wider movement. Madeleine Vionnet is quoted as saying that &quot;when a woman smiles, her dress must smile with her&quot;. Eschewing corsets, padding, stiffening, and anything that distorted the natural curves of a woman&#x27;s body, she became known for clothes that accentuated the natural female form.

Influenced by the modern dances of Isadora Duncan, Vionnet created designs that showed off a woman&#x27;s natural shape. Like Duncan, Vionnet was inspired by ancient Greek art, in which garments appear to float freely around the body rather than distort or mold its shape. Her style changed relatively little over her career, although it became a little more fitted in the 1930s.

In the 1920s, Vionnet had created a stir by developing garments utilizing the bias cut, a technique for cutting cloth diagonal to the grain of the fabric, enabling it to cling to the body while stretching and moving with the wearer. While Vionnet herself did not invent the method of cutting fabric on the bias, she was the first to utilize bias cuts for the entirety of a garment. Her work contrasted existing garments that utilized bias cutting for trims and embellishments placed on fabric pieces cut along the straight-of-grain.

Vionnet&#x27;s use of the bias cut to create a sleek, flattering, body-skimming look revolutionized women&#x27;s clothing and carried her to the top of the fashion world. Although sometimes credited with its invention, Vionnet claimed to have applied the technique, already used in skirts, trims, and embellishments, to full-body dresses. As an expert couturier, Vionnet knew that textiles cut on the bias could be draped to match the curves of a woman&#x27;s body and express fluidity of motion. She used the cut to promote the potential for expression and motion, integrating comfort and movement as well as form into her designs.

Vionnet&#x27;s apparently simple styles involved a lengthy preparation process, including cutting, draping, and pinning fabric designs on miniature dolls. She recreated full garments in chiffon, silk, or Moroccan crepe on life-size models. Vionnet used materials such as crêpe de chine, gabardine, and satin to make her clothes; fabrics that were unusual in women&#x27;s fashion of the 1920s and 30s.

She ordered fabrics two yards wider than necessary to accommodate draping, creating clothes – particularly dresses – that were luxurious and sensual but also simple and modern. Characteristic Vionnet styles that clung to and moved with the wearer included the handkerchief dress, cowl neck, and halter top.

== Influence on later designers ==
Madeleine Vionnet is considered one of the most influential fashion designers of the 20th century. Both her bias cut and her urbanely sensual approach to couture remain a strong and pervasive influence on contemporary fashion, as evidenced by the collections of such past and present-day designers as Ossie Clark, Halston, John Galliano, Comme des Garçons, Azzedine Alaia, Issey Miyake and Marchesa. Miyake once remarked that on seeing Vionnet&#x27;s work for the first time, &quot;the impression was similar to the wonder one feels at the sight of a woman emerging from bathing, draped only in a single piece of beautiful cloth.&quot;

Vionnet inspired fashion designers such as Marcelle Chaumont, mother of French author Madeleine Chapsal. She served as godmother to Chapsal.

<text>Peter Vischer the Elder (January 7, 1529) was a German sculptor, the son of Hermann Vischer, and the most notable member of the Vischer Family of Nuremberg.

==Biography==
Peter was born in Nuremberg, where he also died. He became &quot;master&quot; in 1489, and in 1494 was summoned by Philip, Elector Palatine to Heidelberg. He soon returned, however, to Nuremberg, where he worked with the help of his five sons, Hermann, Peter, Hans, Jakob and Paul.

==Works==

* Tomb of Bishop Johannes IV., in the Breslau cathedral (1496)
* Tomb of Archbishop Ernest, in Magdeburg Cathedral (1495) His chief early work. It is surrounded with statuettes of the Apostles under semi-Gothic canopies. It is purer in style than the Shrine of Saint Sebald (see next item).
* Shrine of Saint Sebald located in the St. Sebaldus Church at Nuremberg (between 1508 and 1519): A tall canopied bronze structure, crowded with reliefs and statuettes in the most lavish way. The general form of the shrine is Gothic, but the details are those of the 16th-century Italian Renaissance. (This great work is really a canopied pedestal to support and enclose the shrine, not the shrine itself, which is a work of the 14th century, having the gabled form commonly used in the Middle Ages for metal reliquaries.) Some of the statuettes of saints attached to the slender columns of the canopy are modeled with much grace and even dignity of form. A small portrait figure of Peter himself, introduced at one end of the base, is a marvel of clever realism: he has represented himself as a stout, bearded man, wearing a large leathern apron and holding some of the tools of his craft. The shrine is a remarkable example of the uncommercial spirit which animated the artists of that time, and of the evident delight which they took in their work. Dragons, grotesques and little figures of boys, mixed with graceful scroll foliage, crowd every possible part of the canopy and its shafts, designed in the most free and unconventional way and executed with an utter disregard of the time and labor which were lavished on them.
* Large grille ordered by the Fugger brothers in Augsburg (lost)
* Relief of the &quot;Crowning of the Blessed Virgin&quot; in the Erfurt cathedral (a second example in the Wittenberg Schlosskirche, 1521)
* Tombstone for Margareta Tucherin in the Regensburg cathedral (1521)
* Tombstone for the Eisen family in the Ägidienkirche at Nuremberg (1522)
* Epitaph for the cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg in the collegiate church at Aschaffenburg (1525)
* Epitaph of the duchess Helene of Mecklenburg in the cathedral at Schwerin

Besides these works there are a number of others ascribed to Peter the Elder with less certainty.

The two figures for the tomb of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor by Peter Vischer (King Arthur &amp; Theodoric the Great), at the Hofkirche, Innsbruck, begun in 1521, are perhaps the most meritorious German work of this class in the 16th century, and show considerable Italian influence. Arthur, and perhaps Theoderic too, was designed by Albrecht Dürer. Headlam believes that Peter Vischer the Younger is responsible for the Arthur and that Peter Vischer the Elder is responsible for Theoderic.

Peter Vischer the Elder is honored at the Walhalla Hall of Fame and Honor, which currently honors 191 German-speaking individuals of the last 1,800 years.

<text>Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, in which the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive vehicles.

== Location of engine and transmission ==
By far the most common layout for a front-wheel-drive car is with the engine and transmission at the front of the car, mounted transversely.

Other layouts of front-wheel drive that have been occasionally produced are a front-engine mounted longitudinally, a mid-engine layout and a rear-engine layout.

== History ==
=== Prior to 1900 ===

Experiments with front-wheel-drive cars date to the early days of the automobile. The world&#x27;s first self-propelled vehicle, Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot&#x27;s 1769/1770 &quot;fardier à vapeur&quot;, was a front-wheel-driven three-wheeled steam-tractor. It then took at least a century for the first experiments with mobile internal combustion engines to gain traction.
Sometime between 1895 and 1898 the Austrian brothers and bicycle producers Franz, Heinrich and Karl Gräf (see Gräf &amp; Stift) commissioned the technician Josef Kainz to build a &quot;voiturette&quot; with a one-cylinder De Dion-Bouton engine fitted in the front of the vehicle, powering the front axle. It is possibly the world&#x27;s first front-wheel-drive automobile, but it never saw series production, with just one prototype made.

In 1898, Latil, in France, devised a front-wheel-drive system for motorising horse-drawn carts.

In 1899 the inventor Henry Sutton designed and built one of Australia&#x27;s first cars, called The Sutton Autocar. This car may have been the first front-wheel-drive car in the world. Henry&#x27;s car was reported in the English press at the time and featured in the English magazine &quot;Autocar&quot;, after which the car was named. Two prototypes of the Autocar were built and the Austral Otis Company was going to go into business with Henry to manufacture Henry&#x27;s car but the cost of the car was too prohibitive as it could not compete with the cost of imported cars.
In 1898–99, the French manufacturer Société Parisienne patented their front-wheel-drive articulated vehicle concept which they manufactured as a Victoria Combination. It was variously powered by De Dion-Bouton engine or a water cooled Aster engine. The engine was mounted on the front axle and so was rotated by the tiller steering. The name Victoria Combination described the lightweight, two-seater trailer commonly known as a Victoria, combined with the rear axle and drive mechanism from a motor tricycle that was placed in front to achieve front wheel drive. It also known as the &quot;Eureka&quot;. By 1899 Victoria Combinations were participating in motoring events such as the Paris–St Malo race, finishing 23rd overall and second(last) in the class. In October a Victoria Combination won its class in the Paris-Rambouillet-Paris event, covering the 100-kilometre course at . In 1900 it completed non-stop at . When production ceased in mid-1901, over 400 units had been sold for 3,000 Francs (circa $600) each.

A different concept was the Lohner–Porsche of 1897 with an electric motor in each front wheel, produced by Lohner-Werke in Vienna. It was developed by Ferdinand Porsche in 1897 based on a concept developed by American inventor Wellington Adams. Porsche also raced it in 1897.

=== 19001920 ===
J. Walter Christie of the United States patented a design for a front-wheel-drive car, the first prototype of which he built in 1904. He promoted and demonstrated several such vehicles, notably with &quot;transversely&quot; mounted engines, by racing at various speedways in the United States, and even competed in the 1906 Vanderbilt Cup and the French Grand Prix. In 1912 he began manufacturing a line of wheeled fire engine tractors which used his front-wheel-drive system, but due to lack of sales this venture failed.

In Australia in 1915 G.J. Hoskins designed and was granted a patent for his front-wheel-drive system. Based in Burwood NSW Mr Hoskins was a prominent member of the Sydney motoring industry and invented a system that used a &quot;spherical radial gear&quot; that was fitted to what is believed to have been a Standard (built by the Standard Motor Company of England). A photo of the car with the system fitted is available from the Mitchell Library and the patent design drawing is still available from the Australian Patent Office. reference; &quot;Gilltraps Australian Cars from 1879 – A history of cars built in Australia&quot; (authors Gilltrap T and M) ISBN 0 85558 936 1 (Golden Press Pty Ltd)

=== 19201930 ===
The next application of front-wheel drive was the supercharged Alvis 12/50 racing car designed by George Thomas Smith-Clarke and William M. Dunn of Alvis Cars of the United Kingdom. This vehicle was entered in the 1925 Kop Hill Climb in Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire on 28 March 1925. Harry Arminius Miller of Menomonie, Wisconsin designed the Miller 122 front-wheel drive race-car that was entered in the 1925 Indianapolis 500, which was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday, 30 May 1925.

However, the idea of front-wheel drive languished outside the motor racing arena as few manufacturers attempted the same for production automobiles. Alvis Cars did introduce a commercial model of the front-wheel drive 12/50 racer in 1928, but it was not a success.

In France, Jean-Albert Grégoire and Pierre Fenaille developed the Tracta constant-velocity joint in 1926. In October 1928 a sensation at the 22nd Paris Motor Show was the Bucciali TAV-6. Six years before the appearance of the Citroën Traction Avant and more than two years before the launch of the DKW F1, the Bucciali TAV-6 featured front-wheel drive. Both German makers DKW in 1931 and Adler in 1933 bought Tracta licenses for their first front-wheel-drive cars. Imperia in Belgium and Rosengart in France manufactured the Adler under the licenses using the Tracta CV joints. During the second World War, all British vehicles, U.S. Jeeps made by Ford and Dodge command cars used Tracta CV joints. Russia and Germany also used the Tracta CV joints, but without the licensing.
The United States only saw a few limited production experiments like the Cord L-29 of 1929, the first American front-wheel-drive car to be offered to the public, and a few months later the Ruxton automobile. The Cord L-29&#x27;s drive system was again inspired by racing, copying from the Indianapolis 500-dominating racers, using the same de Dion layout and inboard brakes.
Moreover, the Auburn (Indiana) built Cord was the first ever front-wheel drive production car to use constant-velocity joints. These very specific components allow motive power to be delivered to steered wheels more seamlessly than universal joints, and have become common on almost every front-wheel-drive car, including on the front axles of almost every four-wheel or all-wheel drive vehicle.

Neither automobile was particularly successful in the open market. In spite of the Cord&#x27;s hallmark innovation, using CV joints, and being competitively priced against contemporaneous alternatives, the buyers demographic were expecting more than the car&#x27;s top speed, and combined with the effect of the Great Depression, by 1932 the Cord L-29 was discontinued, with just 4,400 sold. The 1929 Ruxton sold just 200 cars built that year.

=== 19301945 ===
The first successful consumer application came in 1929. The BSA (Birmingham Small Arms Company) produced the unique front-wheel-drive BSA three-wheeler. Production continued until 1936 during which time sports and touring models were available. In 1931 the DKW F1 from Germany made its debut, with a transverse-mounted engine behind the front axle. This design would continue for 3 decades in Germany. Buckminster Fuller adopted rear-engine, front-wheel drive for his three Dymaxion Car prototypes.
Other German car producers followed: Stoewer offered a car with front-wheel drive in 1931, Adler in 1932 and Audi in 1933. Versions of the Adler Trumpf sold five-figure numbers from 1932 to 1938, totalling over 25,600 units. In 1934, Adler added a cheaper, and even more successful Trumpf Junior model, which sold over 100,000 in August 1939, and in the same year Citroën introduced the very successful Traction Avant models in France, over time selling them in the hundred thousands.

Hupmobile made 2 experimental models with front-wheel drive in 1932 and 1934, but neither came into production

In the late 1930s, the Cord 810/812 of the United States managed a bit better than its predecessor one decade earlier. These vehicles featured a layout that places the engine behind the transmission, running &quot;backwards,&quot; (save for the Cord, which drove the transmission from the front of the engine). The basic front-wheel-drive layout provides sharp turning, and better weight distribution creates &quot;positive handling characteristics&quot; due to its low polar inertia and relatively favourable weight distribution. (The heaviest component is near the centre of the car, making the main component of its moment of inertia relatively low). Another result of this design is a lengthened chassis.

Except for Citroën, after the 1930s, front-wheel drive would largely be abandoned for the following twenty years. Save the interruption of World War II, Citroën built some million Traction Avants through 1957; adding their cheap 2CV people&#x27;s car in 1948, and introducing an equally front-wheel driven successor for the TA, the DS model, in 1955.

=== 19451960 ===
Front-wheel drive continued with the 1948 Citroën 2CV, where the air-cooled lightweight aluminium flat twin engine was mounted ahead of the front wheels, but used Hooke type universal joint driveshaft joints, and 1955 Citroën DS, featuring the mid-engine layout. Panhard of France, DKW of Germany and Saab of Sweden offered exclusively front-wheel-drive cars, starting with the 1948 Saab 92.

In 1946, English car company Lloyd cars produced the Lloyd 650, a front-wheel-drive roadster. The two-stroke, two-cylinder motor was mounted transversely in the front and connected to the front wheels through a four-speed synchronised gearbox. The high price and lacklustre performance doomed its production. Only 600 units were produced from 1946 to 1950.

In 1946 in Italy, Antonio Fessia created his Cemsa Caproni F11, with 7 examples produced. His innovation was to create the happy combination of a low centre of gravity boxer engine (flat four) with a special frame. Due to post-war financial problems Cemsa could not continue production, but the project was resumed when taken on by Lancia in the 50s. In 1954, Alfa-Romeo had experimented with its first front-wheel-drive compact car named &quot;33&quot; (not related to the sports car similarly named &quot;33&quot;). It had the same transverse-mounted, forward-motor layout as modern front-wheel-drive automobiles. It even resembled the smaller version of its popular Alfa Romeo Giulia. However, due to the financial difficulties in post-war Italy, the 33 never saw production. Had Alfa-Romeo succeed in producing 33, it would have preceded the Mini as the first &quot;modern&quot; European front-wheel-drive compact car.

The German car industry resumed from WW2 in 1949/1950. In East Germany (DDR), the pre-war DKW F8 and F9 reappeared as the IFA F8 and IFA F9 in 1949, followed by the AWZ P70 in 1955, the Wartburg 311 in 1956 and the Trabant in 1958, all with front-wheel drive. The P70 and Trabant had Duroplast bodies, and the Trabant had both a monocoque body and a transversely mounted engine, a modern design in some ways. In 1950 West German makers also reintroduced front-wheel-drive cars: DKW had lost its production facilities in Eisenach (now in DDR) and reestablished itself in Ingolstadt. A version of the pre-war F9 was introduced as the DKW F89. Borgward introduced 2 new makes with front-wheel drive, the Goliath and the Lloyd in 1950. Gutbrod also came with a car in 1950; the Superior, but withdrew the car in 1954 and concentrated on other products. This car is best remembered for its Bosch fuel-injection.

In 1955, one of the first Japanese manufacturers to utilize front-wheel drive with a transversely installed engine was the Suzuki Suzulight, which was a small &quot;city&quot; car, called a &quot;kei&quot; car in Japanese.

In 1955, the Polish producer FSO in Warsaw introduced the front-wheel-driven Syrena of its own design.

In 1959 Austin Mini was launched by the British Motor Corporation, designed by Alec Issigonis as a response to the first oil crisis, the 1956 Suez Crisis, and the boom in bubble cars that followed. It was the first production front-wheel-drive car with a watercooled inline four-cylinder engine mounted transversely. This allowed eighty percent of the floor plan for the use of passengers and luggage. The majority of modern cars use this configuration. Its progressive rate rubber sprung independent suspension, low centre of gravity, and wheel at each corner with radial tyres, gave a massive increase in grip and handling over all but the most expensive cars on the market. It initially used flexing rubber instead of needle rollers at the inboard universal joints of the driveshafts but later changed to needle rollers, and GKN designed constant-velocity joint at each outboard end of the drive shafts to allow for steering movement. The Mini revived the use of front-wheel drive which had been largely abandoned since the 1930s.

=== 19601975 ===
The transversely mounted engine combined with front-wheel drive was popularized by the 1959 Mini; there the transmission was built into the sump of the engine, and drive was transferred to it via a set of primary gears. Another variant transmission concept was used by Simca in the 1960s keeping the engine and transmission in line, but transverse mounted and with unequal length driveshafts. This has proven itself to be the model on which almost all modern FWD vehicles are now based. Peugeot and Renault on their jointly developed small car engine of the 1970s where the 4-cylinder block was canted over to reduce the overall height of the engine with the transmission mounted on the side of the crankcase in what became popularly known as the &quot;suitcase&quot; arrangement (PSA X engine). The tendency of this layout to generate unwanted transmission &quot;whine&quot; has seen it fall out of favour. Also, clutch changes required engine removal. In Japan, the Prince Motor Company also developed a transmission-in-sump type layout for its first front wheel drive model, which after the company&#x27;s takeover by Nissan, emerged as the Datsun 100A (Cherry) in 1971.

In 1960 Lancia could evolve the project CemsaF11 of Antonio Fessia with the innovative Lancia Flavia for first time with motor Boxer on auxiliary frame for low centre of gravity. This scheme continued in Lancia until 1984 with the end production of Lancia Gamma and successfully cloned until today by Subaru. Lancia, however also made front-wheel drive its flagship even in sport cars as the winner of the Rally, Lancia Fulvia, and then with large-scale models with excellent road qualities and performances including Lancia Beta, Lancia Delta, Lancia Thema including the powerful Lancia Thema 8.32 with engine Ferrari and all subsequent models.
Ford introduced front-wheel drive to its European customers in 1962 with the TaunusP4. The 1965 Triumph 1300 was designed for a longitudinal engine with the transmission underneath. Audi has also used a longitudinally mounted engine overhung over the front wheels since the 1970s. Audi is one of the few manufacturers which still uses this particular configuration. It allows the use of equal-length half shafts and the easy addition of all-wheel drive, but has the disadvantage that it makes it difficult to achieve 50/50 weight distribution (although they remedy this in four-wheel-drive models by mounting the gearbox at the rear of the transaxle). The Subaru 1000 appeared in 1966 using front-wheel drive mated to a flat-4 engine, with the driveshafts of equal length extending from the transmission, which addressed some of the issues of the powertrain being somewhat complex and unbalanced in the engine compartment – the Alfa Romeo Alfasud (and its replacement, the 1983 Alfa 33 as well as the Alfa 145/146 up to the late 1990s) also used the same layout.

Honda also introduced several small front-wheel drive vehicles, with the N360 and N600, the Z360 and Z600 in 1967, the Honda 1300 in 1969, followed by the Honda Civic in 1972 and the Honda Accord in 1976.

Also in the 1970s and 1980s, the Douvrin engines used in the larger Renaults (20, 21, 25 and 30) used this longitudinal &quot;forward&quot; layout. The Saab Saab 99, launched in 1968, also used a longitudinal engine with a transmission underneath with helical gears. The 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado was the first U.S. front-wheel-drive car since the Cord 810. It used a longitudinal engine placement for its V8, coupled with an unusual &quot;split&quot; transmission, which turned the engine power 180 degrees. Power then went to a differential mounted to the transmission case, from which half-shafts took it to the wheels. The driveline was set fairly at centre-point of the wheels for better weight distribution, though this raised the engine, requiring lowered intake systems.

==== Giacosa innovation ====
Front-wheel-drive layout had been highly impacted by the success of small, inexpensive cars, especially the British Mini. As engineered by Alec Issigonis, the compact arrangement located the transmission and engine sharing a single oil sumpdespite disparate lubricating requirementsand had the engine&#x27;s radiator mounted to the side of the engine, away from the flow of fresh air and drawing heated rather than cool air over the engine. The layout often required the engine be removed to service the clutch.


As engineered by Dante Giacosa, the Fiat 128 featured a transverse-mounted engine with unequal-length drive shafts and an innovative clutch release mechanisman arrangement which Fiat had strategically tested on a previous production model, the Primula, from its less market-critical subsidiary, Autobianchi.

Ready for production in 1964, the Primula featured a gear train offset from the differential and final drive with unequal length drive shafts. The layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting the cooling fan toward fresh air flow. By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout&#x27;s disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential torque steer, the tendency for the power of the engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration. The problem was largely solved by making the shorter driveshaft solid, and the longer one hollow, to ensure both shafts experienced elastic twist which was roughly the same.

After the 128, Fiat further demonstrated the layout&#x27;s flexibility, re-configurating the 128 drive train as a mid-engined layout for the Fiat X1/9. The compact, efficient Giacosa layouta transversely-mounted engine with transmission mounted beside the engine driving the front wheels through an offset final drive and unequal-length driveshafts, combined with MacPherson struts and an independently located radiatorsubsequently became common with competitors and arguably an industry standard.

=== 19751990 ===
The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard drove a mass changeover of cars in the U.S. to front-wheel drive. The change began in 1978, with the introduction of the first American-built transverse-engined cars, the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni (based on the European designed Simca Horizon), followed by the 1980 Chevrolet Citation and numerous other vehicles.
Meanwhile, European car makers, that had moved to front-wheel drive decades before, began to homogenize their engine arrangement only in this decade, leaving Saab, Audi (and Volkswagen) as the only manufacturers offering a front-drive longitudinal engine layout. Years before this was the most common layout in Europe, with examples like Citroën DS, Renault 12, Renault 5, Renault 25 (a Chrysler LH ancestor) Alfa Romeo 33, Volkswagen Passat, etc.
This transition can be exemplified in the Renault 21 that was offered with disparate engine configurations. The 1.7-litre version featured an &quot;east–west&quot; (transversely) mounted engine, but Renault had no gearbox suitable for a more powerful transverse engine: accordingly, faster versions featured longitudinally mounted (north–south) engines.

Despite these developments, however, by the end of the 1980s, almost all major European and Japanese manufacturers had converged around the Fiat-pioneered system of a transversely mounted engine with an &quot;end-on&quot; transmission with unequal length driveshafts. For example, Renault dropped the transmission-in-sump &quot;Suitcase&quot; engine that it had co-developed with Peugeot in the 1970s for its compact models, starting with the Renault 9 in 1982. Peugeot-Citroen themselves also moved over to the end-on gearbox solution when it phased out the Suitcase unit in favour of the TU-series engine in 1986. Nissan also abandoned the transmission-in-sump concept for its N12-series Cherry/Pulsar in 1982. Perhaps symbolically, British Leyland themselves, heirs to the British Motor Corporation – moved over to the industry-standard solution for the Austin Maestro in 1983, and all its subsequent front-wheel-drive models.

By reducing drivetrain weight and space needs, vehicles could be made smaller and more efficient without sacrificing acceleration. Integrating the powertrain with a transverse as opposed to a longitudinal layout, along with unibody construction and the use of constant velocity jointed drive axles, along with front wheel drive has evolved into the modern-day mass-market automobile. Some suggest that the introduction of the modern Volkswagen Golf in 1974, from a traditional U.S. competitor, and the introduction of the 1973 Honda Civic, and the 1976 Honda Accord served as a wake-up call for the &quot;Big Three&quot; (only Chrysler already produced front-wheel-drive vehicles in their operations outside North America). GM was even later with the 1979 Vauxhall Astra/Opel Kadett. Captive imports were the US car makers initial response to the increased demand for economy cars. The popularity of front-wheel drive began to gain momentum, with the 1981 Ford Escort, the 1982 Nissan Sentra, and the 1983 Toyota Corolla. Front-wheel drive became the norm for mid-sized cars starting with the 1982 Chevrolet Celebrity, 1982 Toyota Camry, 1983 Dodge 600, 1985 Nissan Maxima, 1986 Honda Legend, and the 1986 Ford Taurus. By the mid-1980s, most formerly rear-wheel-drive Japanese models were front-wheel drive, and by the mid-1990s, most American brands only sold a handful of rear-wheel-drive models.

=== 1990present ===

The vast majority of front-wheel-drive vehicles today use a transversely mounted engine with &quot;end-on&quot; mounted transmission, driving the front wheels via driveshafts linked via constant velocity (CV) joints, and a flexibly located electronically controlled cooling fan. This configuration was pioneered by Dante Giacosa in the 1964 Autobianchi Primula and popularized with the Fiat 128. Fiat promoted in its advertising that mechanical features consumed only 20% of the vehicle&#x27;s volume and that Enzo Ferrari drove a 128 as his personal vehicle. The 1959 Mini used a substantially different arrangement with the transmission in the sump, and the cooling fan drawing hot air from its side-facing location.

Volvo Cars has switched its entire lineup after the 900 series to front-wheel drive. Swedish engineers at the company have said that transversely mounted engines allow for more crumple zone area in a head-on collision. American auto manufacturers are now shifting larger models (such as the Chrysler 300 and most of the Cadillac lineup) back to rear-wheel drive. There were relatively few rear-wheel-drive cars marketed in North America by the early 1990s; Chrysler&#x27;s car line-up was entirely front-wheel drive by 1990. GM followed suit in 1996 where its B-body line was phased out, where its sports cars (Camaro, Firebird, Corvette) were the only RWDs marketed; by the early 2000s, the Chevrolet Corvette and Cadillac Catera were the only RWD cars offered by General Motors until the introduction of the Sigma platform. After the phaseout of the Ford Panther platform (except for the Mustang), Ford automobiles (including the Transit Connect van) manufactured for the 2012 model year to present are front-wheel drive; its D3 platform (based on a Volvo platform) has optional all-wheel drive.

== Records ==

* The Nissan GT-R LM Nismo race car holds the record for being the most-powerful front-wheel-drive car, with its combustion engine outputs approximately while the flywheel system is intended to have an additional output of approximately . This accounts for a total of . Power from the flywheel was intended to be split between the front and rear wheels, making the car all-wheel drive in this configuration. However, due to unreliability the car was raced without the flywheel and with 500hp driving the front wheels only.
** However, the 1970 Oldsmobile Toronado remains the most-powerful street-legal front-wheel-drive production car, with W-34 option producing .
* A production Dodge Neon SRT-4 from RaceDeck Racing broke the land speed record for its class at Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah on 16 August 2006. Driven by Jorgen Moller Jr., the record was set at average speed for both runs on the course.
* On 3 April 2017, the 5th generation Honda Civic Type R achieved a lap time of 7:43.80 on the Nürburgring Nordschleife, almost 7 seconds faster than its predecessor, setting a new record for front-wheel-drive cars. The car also set new front-wheel drive lap records at the Magny-Cours, Spa-Francorchamps, Silverstone, Estoril, Hungaroring and Mount Panorama circuits. The Nürburgring record was broken by the Renault Mégane RS Trophy-R in July 2019 which set a time of 7:40.10, but in 2020 the Limited Edition Civic Type R broke the Mégane&#x27;s front-wheel drive lap record at the Suzuka Circuit by one and a half seconds.

<text>Jan Carstenszoon or more commonly Jan Carstensz was a 17th-century Dutch explorer. In 1623, Carstenszoon was commissioned by the Dutch East India Company to lead an expedition to the southern coast of New Guinea and beyond, to follow up the reports of land sighted further south in the 1606 voyages of Willem Janszoon in the &quot;Duyfken&quot;.

Setting sail from Ambon in the Dutch East Indies with two ships, the yacht &quot;Pera&quot; (captained by Carstenszoon) and &quot;Arnhem&quot; (captained by Willem Joosten van Colster), the ships travelled along the south coast of New Guinea, then headed south to Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf of Carpentaria. On 14 April 1623, Cape Keerweer was passed. Landing in search of fresh water for his stores, Carstenszoon encountered a party of the local indigenous Australian inhabitants. Carstenszoon described them as &quot;poor and miserable looking people&quot; who had &quot;no knowledge of precious metals or spices&quot;.

On 8 May 1623, Carstenszoon and his crew fought a skirmish with 200 Aboriginal people at the mouth of a small river near Cape Duyfken (named after Janszoon&#x27;s vessel which had earlier visited the region) and landed at the Pennefather River. Carstenszoon named the small river Carpentier River, and the Gulf of Carpentaria in honour of Pieter de Carpentier, at that time Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Carstenszoon reached the Staaten River before heading north again. The &quot;Pera&quot; and Carstenszoon returned to Ambon while the &quot;Arnhem&quot; crossed the Gulf of Carpentaria, sighting the east coast of Arnhem Land.

Carstensz Pyramid, Irian Jaya, Indonesia was named after him. Carstenszoon sighted the glaciers on the peak of the mountain in 1623 and called it &quot;Sneebergh&quot;; he was ridiculed in Europe when he said he had seen snow near the equator. Carstenszoon also named several other features along Australia&#x27;s north coast.

<text>Võ Chí Công (; born Võ Toàn ; 7 August 1912 – 8 September 2011) was a Vietnamese Communist revolutionary, and the Chairman of the Council of State of Vietnam (Alternatively: President of Vietnam) between 1987 and 1992. He was the Standing Deputy Chairman of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam from 1962 to 1976.

==Early life and political activities==
Võ Chí Công was born Võ Toàn in Quảng Nam, French Indochina, in 1912. Võ Chí Công&#x27;s father was Võ Nghiệm a patriot who later became a communist party member and a secretary, who was condemned as a martyr by the Vietnamese government. His mother Nguyễn Thị Thân was later conferred the Vietnamese title as Vietnamese heroic mother. Công was educated in patriotic spirit and influenced by many land magnates such as Hoàng Diệu, Trần Quý Cáp, Phan Châu Trinh, and Huỳnh Thúc Kháng. He first became politically active in 1930, when he joined with Phan Bội Châu and Phan Chu Trinh, two early Vietnamese nationalists who opposed the French colonial regime. He joined the Communist Party of Vietnam led by Hồ Chí Minh in 1935, and fought with the Vietnamese resistance against the Vichy French and Japanese empire during World War II.

==Leadership movement in Central Vietnam==

In October 1941, Võ Chí Công was assigned to the newly re-established Central Party Committee, which was assigned to charge the provinces from Đà Nẵng to Phú Yên. In early 1942, the French colonial government terrorized the revolutionary movement in the central provinces, many Central Party officials and provinces were arrested, some temporarily left the area to contact the higher authorities. Võ Chí Công himself had to stay in the southernmost provinces of Central Vietnam, then proceeded to Đà Lạt to build a base. In June 1942, Secretary of the Quảng Nam Party Committee Trương Hoàn was arrested, sentenced to 20 years in prison by the colonial government, sent to Buôn Ma Thuột. In August 1942, Quảng Nam - Hội An - Đà Nẵng Provincial Party Committee was established by Võ Chí Công and after January 16, 1943, the three parties merged into The Quảng Nam Party. Võ Chí Công was elected as the Party Secretary of the new Quảng Nam Party. In October 1943, due to the betrayal of a provincial commissioner named Cao Tiến Khai, Võ Chí Công and a number of provincial officials, Nguyễn Sắc Kim and Lê Bá were arrested by the French colonial government. Công was sentenced to life imprisonment, then reduced to 25 years imprisonment in Hội An laboratories, then transferred to exile in Buôn Ma Thuột.

On 9 March 1945, Japan overtook France Indochina. For the demobilization of the Vietnamese in support of Japanese rule, the Japanese military released many political prisoners, including Võ Chí Công. After his release, Công returned to Quảng Nam, assigned to the National Salvation Department of the Việt Minh in Quảng Nam Province, as leader of the Uprising, preparing to destroy the French government. As a result of his efforts and his comrades, as well as the quick initiative, the uprising took place in Quảng Nam, starting with Hội An, which took place on August 17, 1945. Quang Nam became one of four provinces to win The earliest government in the country. After the successful August Revolution, Công was appointed Chief Justice of Quảng Nam - Đà Nẵng.

==National Liberation Front founding member==
After the First Indochina War, Công took charge of Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of 5th Region (and elected is member of Central Committee Party in 1960), before becoming a founding member and Deputy Chairman of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF) in 1961. He later became Deputy Secretary of the Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN), and was a key figure in the communist party in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. After the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, Công was awarded a seat on the national Politburo.

==Cabinet career and presidency==
As a Politburo member, Công served in various cabinet posts, including Minister of Fisheries (1976–77), Minister of Agriculture (1977–78), and Deputy Prime Minister (1976–82), before becoming the Chairman of the Council of State of Vietnam (the contemporary equivalent of the President of Vietnam) in 1987. After his presidential term ended in 1992, Công became an advisor to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, until this advisory position was abolished in 1997.

==Death==
Võ Chí Công died in Hồ Chí Minh City on 8 September 2011, aged 99. The Communist Party of Vietnam granted him a televised state funeral in recognition of his long political career.

<doc id="755099" wikidata="Q336319" url="?curid=755099" title="Võ Văn Kiệt">
<text>Võ Văn Kiệt (; 23 November 1922 – 11 June 2008) whose real name is Phan Văn Hòa, was a Vietnamese politician and economic reformer who served as the Prime Minister of Vietnam from 1991 to 1997. A well regarded Vietnamese revolutionary and political leader, Kiệt was a veteran fighter in the long wars against the French colonialists and then the South Vietnamese and American forces during the Vietnam War.

He held key political positions in the South, and during the Second Indochina War, Võ Văn Kiệt was the senior political officer commanding the Saigon district and headquartered in the Củ Chi tunnels. His wife and children were killed when a US plane rocketed a passenger ferry carrying 200 passengers along the Saigon River.

In the difficult post-war years, he was one of the most prominent reformist leaders that led the Đổi mới (lit: &quot;Innovation&quot;) policy in Vietnam since 1986. His premiership (1991–1997) saw the country&#x27;s return to the world arena after decades of war and isolation. He is considered as the &quot;general engineer&quot; of many bold projects of the Doi Moi period.

Kiệt, who played a driving role in the economic reform process in Vietnam that began in the mid-1980s, is exactly what United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon once assessed, &quot;Võ Văn Kiệt paved the way for the transformation of Vietnam from poverty to a decade of impressive economic growth.&quot; The five years of the 6th Party Congress (December 1986) to the 7th Congress (June 1991) were the time of the debate. Conflict and struggle at different levels, and areas between the two trends of returning to the old subsidized bureaucratic mechanism or decisively breaking up with it. Many officials either do it for personal gain or because they do not want it. Having enough determination and capacity, they did not dare and did not want to innovate. Faced with that situation, Võ Văn Kiệt and many senior leaders persevered, showing strong determination to innovate and clearly pointing out that innovation must follow closely, into practical conditions to meet the interests of the people and the country.

As Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers (June 1988 - August 1991), Chairman of the Council of Ministers (August 1991 - October 1992), Prime Minister (October 1992 - December 1997), Kiệt proposed and directed the development and implementation of many groundbreaking policies such as: eliminating ordinance targets, granting business autonomy to state-owned enterprises; commercialize means of production, allowing large enterprises, both central and local, to directly import and export, ending the situation of two prices; abolish the mandatory purchasing regime imposed on farmers, abolish the river ban on markets, implement the free circulation of goods throughout the country, gradually transition the economy from a subsidized to a market economy.

==Background==
Võ Văn Kiệt was born Phan Văn Hòa in 1922 into a peasant family in Trung Hiệp village, Vũng Liêm, Vĩnh Long province in the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam, then a part of Cochinchina in what was called French Indochina. His birth name was Phan Văn Hòa and he changed it to Võ Văn Kiệt when he was admitted to the Indochinese Communist Party in 1939. He also had a pseudonym, Sáu Dân. He joined the Anti-imperialist Youth Movement and took part in the Nam Kỳ (Cochinchina) insurrection in Vũng Liêm district.

==Political career==

Võ Văn Kiệt was a member of the Viet Minh independence movement, he fought against the French colonial powers in the First Indochina War (1946–54) in Southern Vietnam. According to the Geneva Accords, communist cadres were forced to gather in North Vietnam, but he was among those who remained in the South, moving between secret bases in the southeastern region. His first wife, Trần Kim Anh, and his two children were killed in a rocket attack by US forces in 1966.

In 1960, he was elected alternate member of the Communist Party Central Committee and a member of COSVN in 1961, in command of communist forces in Saigon and surrounding areas. After North Vietnamese forces took control of Saigon on April 30, 1975, he led the takeover of the city and in 1976 was appointed as Chairman of the People&#x27;s Committee (alias governor) as well as deputy party secretary of the city, which had been renamed to Ho Chi Minh City in memory of the deceased leader.

In the early postwar years, South Vietnam&#x27;s economy deteriorated rapidly due to the withdrawal of US investment and the harsh Stalinist policies enforced by central government. Saigon, formerly a dynamic economic center, faced for the first time a widespread lack of food and other commodities. As the head of the city government, Võ Văn Kiệt realized that the Soviet economic model was flawed and secretly promoted trade and manufacturing behind the state&#x27;s back. Gradually he became one of the staunchest supporters of the reformist faction in the party, many of whom were local party heads and administrators in southern provinces.

In 1982, he was promoted to Deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers (Vice Premier) and became Chairman of the State Planning Commission. In 1987, he was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam and assumed the role of Acting Prime Minister from March to June 1988 after the sudden death of Phạm Hùng. In the tradition of the party&#x27;s organisation, he should have been made Premier. However, allegedly due to a personal quarrel between Võ Văn Kiệt and Nguyễn Văn Linh - the Secretary General and his longtime superior - as well as opposition from conservative members of the Politburo, Đỗ Mười was chosen instead. In the plenary session of the National Assembly in 1988, however, many delegates nominated him as a second candidate. Even though he got only 35% of votes, this was unprecedented, as elections in the National Assembly had previously had only one candidate and they were essentially just a rubber-stamp of decisions made by the Party Politburo.

After 1975, around 4 million people suffered from food shortages in Saigon. People often had to eat rice stuffed with potatoes and cassava. The reason was that the state reformed private enterprise in the South and monopolized the wholesale stage. This caused the entire network of rice traders and granary owners in the West to be eliminated, replaced by state-owned trading companies. However, the state&#x27;s buying price at that time was &quot;as low as it was&quot;, farmers in the West had rice but refused to sell it. Even if the government has money, it is not allowed to buy rice at the agreed price because it can easily be accused of going against the subsidy policy.

As Secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt was then faced with two options: strictly comply with the state&#x27;s purchasing price or &quot;break the barrier&quot; to find a way to buy rice to save the country.

During the 1978-1979 period, Ho Chi Minh City also faced a shortage of imported sources, causing the input of the entire production to decline, leading to a crisis in goods and labor. Kiệt discussed with city leaders to find ways to &quot;tear down&quot; the import of some necessary raw materials for production.

==Prime minister==

Võ Văn Kiệt took the role of First Vice Premier and continued to push his reform agenda. In 1991, he was elected as Prime Minister, an office he held until 1997. His tenure marked the advance of the administrative branch at the expense of the influence of the Party&#x27;s institutions, when the power was shared by three top leaders: himself as Prime Minister, General Secretary Đỗ Mười, and President Lê Đức Anh. He initiated a large program of economic reform, reorganised the government and urged the broadening of diplomatic ties. In the early 1990s Vietnam gradually recovered from the economic crisis of the previous decade. In 1995 the country joined the ASEAN community and normalized relations with the US, ending 20 years of formal mutual enmity and American embargo after the fall of Saigon.

In 1986, the reform policy of the Communist Party of Vietnam blew new winds. However, the southern region and Ho Chi Minh City - places with early access to industry - still cannot create a strong breakthrough due to serious electricity shortages due to very limited local sources, and rotating power cuts are daily matter.

The decision to build a 500kV North - South super high voltage line to transmit electricity from North to South, helping the South alleviate its electricity thirst, was officially raised by Võ Văn Kiệt with leaders of the Ministry of Energy during a meal. In 1991, the answer &quot;Can do&quot; by Minister of Energy Vũ Ngọc Hải a week later was also the beginning of a mountain of work that needed to be implemented.

He ordered strict punishment, no matter who that person was or what position he was in. Later, Minister of Energy Vũ Ngọc Hải, who created the North-South 500kV power transmission line project, was convicted of irresponsibility in management and sentenced to three years in prison, as were a number of related officials who were dismissed from their posts. Kiệt announced that if the 500KV line fails, he will automatically resign.

The project was approved by the Politburo in January 1992. On 25 February 1992, the Government approved the economic-technical thesis with a completion time decision of 2 years and due to the emergency period, allowing implementation by survey, design, import of materials and equipment and construction to be carried out in parallel.

After more than 2 years of building the 500kV North - South Line, circuit 1, at exactly 7:00 p.m., 7 minutes and 59 seconds on 27 May 1994, Võ Văn Kiệt ordered the Southern power system to be merged with 4 units of the Hydroelectric Plant Hòa Bình in Đà Nẵng. After this event, many people called him &quot;Electricity Prime Minister&quot;, a commander-in-chief of the industry, a leader who laid the foundation and made great contributions to a unified electricity grid nationwide, meeting the needs of the entire country. development and economic integration as of today. Kiệt&#x27;s old decision solved the problem of electricity shortage in the South and promoted economic development. Ho Chi Minh City is the economic development engine of the country.

The conflict between reformist and conservative factions increased and culminated in a series of power struggles in the mid-1990s. Representing the reformists, Võ Văn Kiệt advocated for further privatisation of the state dominated economy, as well as democratization - an approach criticised by his political rivals as dangerous to &quot;socialist orientation&quot;. In 1996, after the party could not create a consensus on personnel arrangement, all of the three top leaders remained in their positions. However, factionalism was only intensified and eventually led Võ Văn Kiệt and his opponents Mười and Anh to step down at the same time in 1997. They continued to influence the country affairs as advisors to the Standing Committee of the party until 2001.

==Final years==
After retiring from politics, Võ Văn Kiệt lived in Ho Chi Minh City. He remained a member of the Advisory Council to the Party&#x27;s Central Committee until 2001. Since then, he had spoken out on many issues, and was seen as a defender of people&#x27;s rights.

Võ Văn Kiệt was the highest-ranking former government official to have openly spoken out about reconciliation with Vietnamese exiles and democracy activists. He had spoken out against the proposed expansion of Hanoi and the demolition of the historic National Assembly building in Ba Đình Square to make place for a new one.

== Death and state funeral ==
Võ Văn Kiệt was admitted to Singapore&#x27;s Mount Elizabeth Hospital on June 3, 2008 and died at the age of 85 on June 11, 2008.

State media did not announce his death until the night of June 12, after most foreign news agencies had already reported it and many foreign dignitaries had already offered condolences, including United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The government of Vietnam announced a state funeral on June 14 and 15 to be held in the Reunification Palace (Ho Chi Minh City), Hanoi, and his birth province Vĩnh Long.

Memorial and burial services at state level for Võ Văn Kiệt were organized in Vietnam&#x27;s southern Hồ Chí Minh City on Sunday morning June 15, 2008 with the participation of many residents and officials, including the country&#x27;s top party and state leaders. Thousands of mourners lined the streets of Hồ Chí Minh City for the state funeral of Võ Văn Kiệt.

&quot;The death of former prime minister Võ Văn Kiệt is a great loss to the party, state, people and his family... He had a spirit of daring to think and daring to do. The comrade (Võ Văn Kiệt) and party and state leaders led all people to conduct the renovation cause, bringing our country out of the socioeconomic crisis,&quot; Nông Đức Mạnh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and head of the funeral board, said at the memorial service televised live by the Central Vietnam Television.

Top Communist Party officials, some wearing black suits and black ties, solemnly stood to attention in the front row of mourners before Võ Văn Kiệt&#x27;s coffin during the service. Relatives stood in black mourning clothes and white headbands.

The coffin was draped in Vietnam&#x27;s red flag with a gold star and enclosed in a glass case for transportation on a gun carriage through city streets to the national cemetery for burial.

Tens of thousands of mourners lined the streets to honor Võ Văn Kiệt as his coffin was carried in a procession of military vehicles through Hồ Chí Minh City to be cremated.

The country&#x27;s political elite paid their respects in Reunification Palace, where Communist Party chief Nông Đức Mạnh headed long lines of mourners who filed past Võ Văn Kiệt&#x27;s coffin from early Saturday.

As his body lay in state, the palace hall was filled with incense smoke and funeral music played by an army band. Saturday and Sunday were declared days of mourning with flags flying at half-mast at official buildings.

In a statement, current Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng paid tribute to Võ Văn Kiệt as &quot;a wholehearted, loyal, irrepressible and heroic revolutionary. All his life, all his heart and all his force was for the country and the people.&quot;

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Phạm Gia Khiêm told AFP that Võ Văn Kiệt &quot;was very dynamic in setting policy in the renovation period, and I think his contribution will stay with the Vietnamese people forever.&quot;

==Eulogy==
The eulogy for Võ Văn Kiệt was given by communist party leader Nông Đức Mạnh at the Reunification Palace in Hồ Chí Minh City, where his body had been lying in state.

He described Võ Văn Kiệt as &quot;an excellent leader of our party, state and people, a faithful revolutionary fighter who has devoted his whole life for national independence, socialism and people&#x27;s happiness&quot;. Võ Văn Kiệt&#x27;s flag-draped coffin, carried in a glass case and accompanied by a military procession, was then taken through the streets, where thousands of mourners waited to pay tribute. Vietnam held two days of national mourning. Among the grey ranks of Vietnam&#x27;s communist leadership, Võ Văn Kiệt was one of few figures to have stood out.

Credited as a leading figure in the economic reforms known as Đổi Mới, which have transformed Vietnam&#x27;s economy, he was a rarity among senior officials in speaking out publicly against the failings of the economic system. One of his comrades in arms, Trần Quốc Hương, former head of intelligence for the Việt Cộng network in South Vietnam, wrote in the condolence book: &quot;I was deeply moved by your death. You were my comrade, my friend, and my brother.&quot;

After the communist victory in 1975 he became party secretary of Saigon, and quietly defied hard-line official policy by trying to work with officials and businesses associated with the defeated government. As prime minister, Võ Văn Kiệt presided over a period of dramatic economic growth and foreign investment.

In an interview with the BBC in 2007 he questioned whether Communist Party members were true patriots, saying: &quot;The motherland of Vietnam doesn&#x27;t belong to one person, one party or one group only.&quot;

In his final weeks, Võ Văn Kiệt also spoke out against the expansion of the capital Hanoi and expressed concern whether Vietnam could protect itself against rising sea levels caused by global warming.

==Legacy==
Võ Văn Kiệt led Vietnam&#x27;s economic reform of the 1990s and its reopening to the outside world after decades of isolation. His death raises questions about which way the communist party in Vietnam would move on. There were signs in late 2010s that Võ Văn Kiệt&#x27;s reformist allies had been losing their influence.

Out of office, since 1997, Võ Văn Kiệt remained active in politics, publishing commentaries pushing for more liberalisation even as Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization in 2007 and averaged annual GDP growth of 7.5 percent since 2000.

<doc id="755102" wikidata="Q1241067" url="?curid=755102" title="Old Europe (archaeology)">
<text>Old Europe is a term coined by the Lithuanian archaeologist Marija Gimbutas to describe what she perceived as a relatively homogeneous pre-Indo-European Neolithic and Copper Age culture or civilisation in Southeast Europe, centred in the Lower Danube Valley. Old Europe is also referred to in some literature as the Danube civilisation. 

The term &#x27;Danubian culture&#x27; was earlier coined by the archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe to describe early farming cultures (e.g. the Linear Pottery culture) which spread westwards and northwards from the Danube Valley into Central and Eastern Europe.

==Old Europe==

Neolithic Europe refers to the time between the Mesolithic and Bronze Age periods in Europe, roughly from 7000 BC (the approximate time of the first farming societies in Greece) to c. 2000 BC (the beginning of the Bronze Age in Scandinavia). Its peak period is estimated as 5000–3500 BC, during which its population centers exceeded the first Mesopotamian cities. A high level of craft skill and trade is evident from tons of recovered copper artifacts and a small amount of gold, as well as pottery and carved items. These include the period&#x27;s signature female figurines which have raised interest in the role of the society&#x27;s women, as well as suspected proto-writing.

Regardless of specific chronology, many European Neolithic groups share basic characteristics, such as living in small-scale communities, being more egalitarian than the city-states and chiefdoms of the Bronze Age, subsisting on domestic plants and animals supplemented with the collection of wild plant foods and hunting, and producing hand-made pottery, without the aid of the potter&#x27;s wheel. There are also many differences, with some Neolithic communities in southeastern Europe living in heavily fortified settlements of 3,000–4,000 people (e.g., Sesklo in Greece) whereas Neolithic groups in Britain were usually small (possibly 50–100 people).

Marija Gimbutas studied the Neolithic period in order to understand cultural developments in settled village culture in the southern Balkans, which she characterized as peaceful, matristic, and possessing a goddess-centered religion. In contrast, she characterizes the later Indo-European influences as warlike, nomadic, and patrilineal. Using evidence from pottery and sculpture, and combining the tools of archaeology, comparative mythology, linguistics, and, most controversially, folkloristics, Gimbutas invented a new interdisciplinary field, archaeomythology.

In historical times, some ethnonyms are believed to correspond to Pre-Indo-European peoples, assumed to be the descendants of the earlier Old European cultures: the Pelasgians, Minoans, Leleges, Iberians, Nuragic people, Etruscans, Rhaetians, Camunni and Basques. Two of the three pre-Greek peoples of Sicily, the Sicans and the Elymians, may also have been pre-Indo-European. 

How many Pre-Indo-European languages existed is not known. Nor is it known whether the ancient names of peoples descended from the pre-ancient population actually referred to speakers of distinct languages. Gimbutas (1989), observing a unity of symbols marked especially on pots, but also on other objects, concluded that there may have been a single language spoken in Old Europe. She thought that decipherment would have to wait for the discovery of bilingual texts.

The idea of a Pre-Indo-European language in the region precedes Gimbutas. It went by other names, such as &quot;Pelasgian&quot;, &quot;Mediterranean&quot;, or &quot;Aegean&quot;. Apart from marks on artifacts, the main evidence concerning Pre-Indo-European language is in names: toponyms, ethnonyms, etc., and in roots in other languages believed to be derived from one or more prior languages, possibly unrelated. Reconstruction from the evidence is an accepted, though somewhat speculative, field of study. Suggestions of possible Old European languages include Urbian by Sorin Paliga, and the Vasconic substratum hypothesis of Theo Vennemann (also see Sigmund Feist&#x27;s Germanic substrate hypothesis).

==Indo-European origins==

According to Gimbutas&#x27; version of the Kurgan hypothesis, Old Europe was invaded and destroyed by horse-riding pastoral nomads from the Pontic–Caspian steppe (the &quot;Kurgan culture&quot;) who brought with them violence, patriarchy, and Indo-European languages. More recent proponents of the Kurgan hypothesis agree that the cultures of Old Europe spoke pre-Indo-European languages but include a less dramatic transition, with a prolonged migration of Proto-Indo-European speakers after Old Europe&#x27;s collapse due to other factors.

Colin Renfrew&#x27;s competing Anatolian hypothesis suggests that the Indo-European languages were spread across Europe by the first farmers from Anatolia. In the hypothesis&#x27; original formulation, the languages of Old Europe belonged to the Indo-European family but played no special role in its transmission. According to Renfrew&#x27;s most recent revision of the theory, however, Old Europe was a &quot;secondary urheimat&quot; (linguistic homeland) where the Greek, Armenian, and Balto-Slavic language families diverged around 5000 BC. Three genetic studies in 2015 gave partial support to the Steppe theory regarding the Indo-European Urheimat. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the steppes north of the Pontic and Caspian seas, along with at least some of the Indo-European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages.

<doc id="755109" wikidata="Q2725656" url="?curid=755109" title="Ilium (novel)">
<text>Ilium is a science fiction novel by American writer Dan Simmons, the first part of the &quot;Ilium/Olympos&quot; cycle, concerning the re-creation of the events in the &quot;Iliad&quot; on an alternate Earth and Mars. These events are set in motion by beings who have taken on the roles of the Greek gods. Like Simmons&#x27;s earlier series, the Hyperion Cantos, the novel is a form of &quot;literary science fiction&quot; that relies heavily on intertextuality, in this case with Homer and Shakespeare, as well as periodic references to Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (or &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;) and Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle&quot;. In July 2004, &quot;Ilium&quot; received a Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel of 2004.

==Plot summary==
The novel centers on three character groups: that of Hockenberry (a resurrected twentieth-century Homeric scholar whose duty is to compare the events of the &quot;Iliad&quot; to the reenacted events of the Trojan War), Greek and Trojan warriors, and Greek gods from the &quot;Iliad&quot;; Daeman, Harman, Ada, and other humans of an Earth thousands of years after the twentieth century; and the &quot;moravec&quot; robots (named for scientist and futurist Hans Moravec) Mahnmut the Europan and Orphu of Io, also thousands of years in the future, but originating in the Jovian system. The novel is written in first-person, present-tense when centered on Hockenberry&#x27;s character, but features third-person, past-tense narrative in all other instances. Much like Simmons&#x27; &quot;Hyperion&quot;, where the actual events serve as a frame, the three groups of characters&#x27; stories are told over the course of the novel and begin to converge as the climax nears.

==Reception==
&quot;Ilium&quot; won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2004, and was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel, that same year.

<text>Andrew John Volstead () (October 31, 1859 – January 20, 1947) was an American member of the United States House of Representatives from Minnesota, 1903–1923, and a member of the Republican Party. His name is closely associated with the National Prohibition Act of 1919, usually called the Volstead Act. The act was the enabling legislation for the enforcement of Prohibition in the United States beginning in 1920.

==Early life==
Volstead was born in Kenyon, Goodhue County, Minnesota, to Norwegian-American parents Jon Einertson Vraalstad (John Vrolstad), a distant relative of Queen Sonja of Norway, and wife Dorothea Mathea Lillo. He was educated at St. Olaf College, became a lawyer and served as mayor of Granite Falls, Minnesota, from 1900 to 1902. According to his obituary in a 1947 edition of the &quot;Minneapolis Star&quot;, he first practiced law in Grantsburg, Wisconsin, before moving to Granite Falls in 1886.

==Congressional career==
While in Congress, he served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from 1919 to 1923. Although often considered the author of the Volstead Act, he collaborated with Wayne Wheeler of the Anti-Saloon League, who conceived and largely drafted the bill. However, Volstead sponsored the bill and championed, promoted and facilitated its passage. He also helped author the Capper–Volstead Act, which enabled farmers to form locally owned cooperatives without fear of prosecution under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The law is still in effect.

Volstead was a member of the 58th, 59th, 60th, 61st, 62nd, 63rd, 64th, 65th, 66th, and 67th congresses. He was defeated in his attempt to be elected to an 11th term in 1922. Shortly thereafter he was hired as legal adviser to the chief of the National Prohibition Enforcement Bureau.

Upon repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Volstead returned to Granite Falls, Minnesota, where he resumed the private practice of law.

He died in 1947. Volstead&#x27;s former home, located at 163 Ninth Avenue, Granite Falls, Minnesota, is a National Historic Landmark. He is buried in the Granite Falls city cemetery.

<text>Pont-Saint-Esprit (, literally &quot;Holy Spirit Bridge&quot;; ) is a commune in the Gard département in southern France. It is situated on the river Rhône and is the site of a historical crossing, hence its name. The Ardèche flows into the Rhône, just to the north of the bridge. The residents are called Spiripontains.

==History==

The bridge was observed by the Irish pilgrim Symon Semeonis in 1323 on his way to the Holy Land: &quot;Pont-Saint-Esprit where there is a famous stone bridge over the Rhône, half a mile in length, the height of which and the breadth of its arches are greatly admired by all those who cross over it.&quot; Italian canon Antonio de Beatis described the bridge in his 1517-1518 travel journal: &quot;This has twenty tall, wide arches, is finely built in a pleasing stone and is still better paved.&quot;

In the seventeenth century the Jewish immigrants from Spain were cast out of central Bayonne and settled in Saint Esprit. This quarter became known in popular parlance as Saint Esprit les Israélites because Jews constituted the majority of its population -which was extremely rare in France. It was a Jew of Spanish origin, Gaspar Dacosta, who introduced the art of chocolate-making to Saint Esprit, and indeed in France. 

==Geography==
===Climate===

Pont-Saint-Esprit has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). The average annual temperature in Pont-Saint-Esprit is . The average annual rainfall is with November as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Pont-Saint-Esprit was on 6 August 2003; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 7 January 1985.

==Bouvier family origins==
Pont-Saint-Esprit is famous as the town of origin of Michel Bouvier, a cabinetmaker, who was the ancestor of John Vernou Bouvier III, father of Jacqueline Kennedy.

==1951 mass poisoning incident==
On 15 August 1951, an outbreak of poisoning, marked by acute psychotic episodes and various physical symptoms, occurred in Pont-Saint-Esprit. More than 250 people were involved, including 50 persons interned in asylums and four deaths. Most academic sources accept naturally occurring ergot poisoning in rye flour as the cause of the epidemic, while a few theorize other causes such as poisoning by mercury, mycotoxins, or nitrogen trichloride.

<doc id="755123" wikidata="Q1098903" url="?curid=755123" title="Claus von Bülow">
<text>Claus von Bülow (born Claus Cecil Borberg; 11 August 1926 – 25 May 2019) was a British lawyer, consultant and socialite. In 1982, he was convicted of both the attempted murder of his wife Sunny von Bülow (born Martha Sharp Crawford; 1932–2008) in 1979, which had left her in a temporary coma, as well as an alleged insulin overdose in 1980 that left her in a persistent vegetative state for the rest of her life. On appeal, both convictions were reversed, and Bülow was found not guilty at his second trial.

== Background ==
Beginning life as Claus Cecil Borberg, Bülow was the son of Danish author and playwright, Svend Borberg (1888–1947) and his wife, Jonna von Bülow-Plüskow (1900–1959). His father was accused, though later cleared, of being a Nazi collaborator for his activities during the Second World War in the German occupation of Denmark. After graduating from university with a degree in law and becoming an apprentice in the legal profession, Claus chose to be known by his maternal surname, Bülow, instead of his father&#x27;s surname, Borberg. His mother was the daughter of Frits Bülow von Plüskow, Danish Minister of Justice from 1910 to 1913, president of the upper chamber of the Danish Parliament from 1920 to 1922 and a member of the old Dano-German noble Bülow family, originally from Mecklenburg.

Bülow graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and practised law in London in the 1950s before working as a personal assistant to J. Paul Getty. While he had a variety of duties for Getty, Bülow became very familiar with the economics of the oil industry. Getty wrote that Bülow showed &quot;remarkable forbearance and good nature&quot; as his occasional whipping boy, and Bülow remained with Getty until 1968.

On 6 June 1966, Bülow married Sunny, the American ex-wife of Prince Alfred von Auersperg. He worked on and off as a consultant to oil companies. Sunny already had a son and a daughter from her first marriage; together, she and Bülow had a daughter, Cosima von Bülow, born on 15 April 1967 in New York City.

== Attempted murder trials ==
In 1982, Bülow was arrested and tried for the attempted murders of Sunny on two occasions in two consecutive years. The main medical and scientific evidence against him was that Sunny had low blood sugar, common in many conditions, but a blood test showed a high insulin level. The test was not repeated. A needle was used as evidence against Bülow in court, with the prosecution alleging that he had used it and a vial of insulin to try to kill his wife. His mistress of two years, the soap opera actress Alexandra Isles, testified &quot;He said that they had been having a long argument, talk, about divorce that had gone on late into the night. She had drunk a great deal of eggnog. And then he said, &#x27;I saw her take the Seconal.&#x27; And then he said that the next day when she was unconscious that he watched her knowing that she was in a bad way, all day, and watched her and watched her. And finally, when she was at the point of dying he said that he couldn&#x27;t go through with it and he called (the doctor) and saved her life. The discovery of these items became the focal point of Bülow&#x27;s appeal.

At the trial in Newport, Rhode Island, Bülow was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison; he appealed, hiring Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz to represent him. Dershowitz served as a consultant to the defence team led by Thomas Puccio, a former federal prosecutor. Dershowitz&#x27;s campaign to acquit Bülow was assisted by Jim Cramer and future New York attorney general and governor Eliot Spitzer, who were then Harvard Law School students. Dershowitz and his team focused on the discovery of the bag containing the syringes and insulin. Sunny&#x27;s family had hired a private investigator to look into her coma. The private investigator, Edwin Lambert (an associate of the Bülows&#x27; lawyer Richard Kuh), was told by several family members and a maid that Claus had recently been seen locking a closet in the Newport home that previously was always kept open. The family hired a locksmith to drive to the mansion, with the intention of picking the closet lock to find what the closet contained. They had lied to the locksmith and told him that one of them owned the house. When the three arrived, the locksmith insisted that they try again to find the key, and after some searching, Kuh found a key in Claus von Bülow&#x27;s desk that unlocked the closet. At this point, according to the three men in the original interviews, the locksmith was paid for the trip and left before the closet was actually opened, although the men would later recant that version and insist that the locksmith was present when they entered the closet. It was in the closet that the main evidence against Claus von Bülow was found. In 1984, the two convictions from the first trial were reversed by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. In 1985, after a second trial, Bülow was found not guilty on all charges.

At the second trial, the defence called eight medical experts, all university professors, who testified that Sunny&#x27;s two comas had not been caused by insulin, but by a combination of ingested (not injected) drugs, alcohol, and chronic health conditions. The experts were John Caronna (chairman of neurology, Cornell); Leo Dal Cortivo (former president, U.S. Toxicology Association); Ralph DeFronzo (medicine, Yale University); Kurt Dubowski (forensic pathology, University of Oklahoma); Daniel Foster (medicine, University of Texas Southwestern); Daniel Furst (medicine, University of Iowa); Harold Lebovitz (director of clinical research, State University of New York); Vincent Marks (clinical biochemistry, Surrey, vice-president Royal College of Pathologists and president, Association of Clinical Biochemistry); and Arthur Rubinstein (medicine, University of Chicago).

Cortivo testified that the hypodermic needle tainted with insulin on the outside (but not inside) would have been dipped in insulin but not injected; injecting it through flesh would have wiped it clean. Evidence also showed that Sunny&#x27;s hospital admission three weeks before her final coma showed she had ingested at least 73 aspirin tablets, a quantity that could only have been self-administered, and which indicated her state of mind.

Dershowitz, in his book &quot;Taking the Stand&quot;, writes about Claus von Bülow&#x27;s dinner party after he was found not guilty at his trial. Dershowitz replied to the invitation that he would not attend if it was a &quot;victory party&quot;, and Bülow assured him that it was only a dinner for &quot;several interesting friends&quot;. Norman Mailer also attended the dinner where Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to Bülow not having attempted to murder his wife. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed the arm of his wife, Norris Church Mailer, and said: &quot;Let&#x27;s get out of here. I think this guy is innocent. I thought we were going to be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring.&quot;

Upon his acquittal, von Bülow made his home in London while making occasional appearances at social events and Broadway opening nights in London for the rest of his life.

== Death ==
Bülow died on 25 May 2019 at his home in London, England.

== In popular culture ==
*The 1990 film &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; depicts the case and its surrounding fallout. For his portrayal of Claus von Bülow, Jeremy Irons won the Academy Award for Best Actor.
*Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire from &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; are named after Claus and Sunny von Bülow.

<doc id="755129" wikidata="Q7115275" url="?curid=755129" title="Oxford Circus fire">
<text>The Oxford Circus fire occurred on 23 November 1984 at Oxford Circus station on
the London Underground. Oxford Circus station is in the heart of London&#x27;s shopping district and is served by three deep-level tube lines: the Bakerloo line, Central line and Victoria line. The three lines are linked by a complex network of tunnels and cross-passages which all converge to a common booking hall situated beneath the junction of Oxford Street and Regent Street.

The fire started in a materials store at the south end of the northbound Victoria line platform, which was being used by contractors working on the modernisation of the station. It gutted the northbound Victoria line platform tunnel and the passages leading off it. The adjacent northbound Bakerloo line platform suffered smoke damage, as did the escalator tunnel and the booking hall. Other areas of the station were undamaged. The most likely cause of the fire was a smoker discarding smoking materials through a ventilation grille into the materials store, which ignited rags or paint thinner.

==Discovery==
At 9:50 p.m., a station inspector, on duty in the mezzanine level, was told by a passenger of smoke on the northbound Victoria line platform. He took a piece of wood with him down to the platform, expecting to deal with something smouldering on the track. When he saw that it was the contractors&#x27; storage area on fire, he tried to use a telephone in a kiosk nearby, but opening the door of the kiosk released thick smoke that drove him back. He then retreated and started the evacuation.

==Evacuation==
Oxford Circus station was rapidly evacuated when the fire was discovered, and the London Fire Brigade conducted a sweep of the station which confirmed that all passengers were clear. The fire alert disrupted the routes of 10 trains on the three lines: passengers on six of the trains were evacuated at stations and passengers on four trains were escorted down the running tunnels to adjacent stations. The last passenger evacuated from these trains left the track at 12:45 a.m.. 30 pumps attended the fire, which was declared extinguished just before 3 a.m. the next day.

==Injuries==
No one was killed as a result of the fire; 14 people (four passengers, one police officer and nine members of London Underground staff) were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation, of whom all but one were released next day.

==Reconstruction==
The gutted areas of the station had to be completely reconstructed, which in the case of the Victoria line platform tunnel involved sealing the ends so that the waterproof lining of the platform tunnel could be removed without releasing asbestos fibres into the atmosphere of the Underground. The removal took just over three weeks. Passenger services were restarted on the Central line the following morning. Northbound Bakerloo line trains were not permitted to stop at the station until 30 November, by which time the access tunnels to the Bakerloo northbound platform had been cleared of fire damage.

==Effects on services==
Victoria line service through central London and to the station recommenced on 17 December, with the platform tunnel having been stripped of all fittings down to the tunnel segment rings. Wooden hoardings were erected at the rear of the platform and the entire platform tunnel was whitewashed. Reconstruction of the decorative fittings on the platform was not completed until early 1986.

==Smoking bans==
Whilst smoking had been banned on London Underground trains since July 1984, at the time of the Oxford Circus fire it was still allowed in stations. In response to the fire, a complete ban on smoking in all physically underground stations was introduced in February 1985.

Nonetheless, a similar incident occurred on 18 November 1987 at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station when it was concluded as probable that a passenger had dropped a lit match onto an escalator. The resulting fire killed 31 people. After the King&#x27;s Cross fire, staff training was increased and the smoking ban was enforced much more strictly with fines being introduced for offenders.

<doc id="755133" wikidata="Q292808" url="?curid=755133" title="Sunny von Bülow">
<text>Martha Sharp &quot;Sunny&quot; von Bülow (; September 1, 1932 − December 6, 2008) was an American heiress and socialite. Her second husband, Claus von Bülow, was convicted in 1982 of attempting to murder her by insulin overdose, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. A second trial found him not guilty, after experts opined that there was no insulin injection and that her symptoms were attributable to overuse of prescription drugs. The story was dramatized in the book and film &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot;. Sunny von Bülow lived almost 28 years in a persistent vegetative state, from December 1980 until her death in a New York City nursing home on December 6, 2008.

==Early life==
She was the only child of utilities magnate George Crawford (a former chairman of Columbia Gas &amp; Electric Company) and his wife, Annie-Laurie Warmack. She was born on her father&#x27;s personal railway carriage in Manassas, Virginia, en route from Hot Springs, Virginia, to New York, for which she was known as &quot;Choo-Choo&quot; as a child before being nicknamed &quot;Sunny&quot; because of her nature.

Upon her father&#x27;s death, when she was three years old, she inherited a reported US$100 million. Her mother, the daughter of the founder of the International Shoe Company, later married Russell Aitken, a sculptor and writer.

==Personal life==
On July 20, 1957, Sunny married Alfred Eduard Friedrich Vincenz Martin Maria Auersperg. He came from a very distinguished Austrian princely family family that once ruled over the Principality of Auersperg, but due to the collapse of the Austrian Empire, his family became relatively impoverished. Sunny and Alfred met while he was her tennis instructor in a Swiss resort. 

They had two children together:
*Annie-Laurie &quot;Ala&quot; von Auersperg (born 1958), co-founder of the National Center for Victims of Crime, who married financier Ralph H. Isham, son of diplomat Heyward Isham.
*Alexander Georg von Auersperg (born 1959), co-founder of the National Center for Victims of Crime, who married investment banker Nancy Louise Weinberg.

The Auerspergs were divorced in 1965. At that time, Sunny&#x27;s net worth was over $75 million. Alfred Auersperg died in 1992 after lingering in an irreversible coma for nine years following a 1983 car accident in Austria.

On June 6, 1966, Sunny married Claus von Bülow, a former aide to oilman J. P. Getty, at the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City. His maternal grandfather, whose surname he took, was Frits Toxwerdt von Bülow, Justice Minister of Denmark in the government of Klaus Berntsen (1910–1913) and also came from a noble background.

Together, they had a daughter:
*Cosima von Bülow (born 1967), who married Count Riccardo Pavoncelli.

By 1979, significant stresses and tensions had developed in their marriage, and both Sunny and Claus spoke openly about the possibility of a divorce.

==1979 incident==
On December 26, 1979, after the family had come together for Christmas at their Newport, Rhode Island mansion, she was found unresponsive and was rushed to the hospital where she slipped into a coma, but was revived. After days of testing, doctors determined the coma was the result of low blood sugar and diagnosed her as hypoglycemic, warning her against overindulging on sweets or going too long without eating. While no foul play was suspected at the time, Claus von Bülow was later accused of causing this incident by injecting her with insulin. In April 1980, she was again hospitalized after appearing incoherent and disoriented; their doctors reconfirmed she suffered from reactive hypoglycemia. She was advised to maintain control of the hypoglycemia by following a strict diet, limiting her sugar intake, and avoiding alcohol.

==1980 incident==
On the evening of December 21, 1980, while celebrating Christmas with her family at their mansion, Clarendon Court, in Newport, Rhode Island, she again displayed confusion and lack of coordination. She was put to bed by her family, but in the morning she was discovered unconscious on the bathroom floor. She was taken to the hospital where it became clear that this time she had suffered severe enough brain injury to produce a persistent vegetative state. Although clinical features resembled a drug overdose, some of the laboratory evidence suggested hypoglycemia. The Court of Appeal ordered disclosure of the notes taken by the Auersperg children&#x27;s attorney. These showed that Claus von Bülow did not want to terminate life support, as had been alleged.

Because of the increased marital tensions between Claus and Sunny von Bülow in the fall of 1980, her children were suspicious that her brain injury was the result of foul play by him. Her two eldest children persuaded Richard H. Kuh, the former New York County District Attorney, to investigate the possibility Claus von Bülow had attempted the murder of their mother. After the gathering of evidence, Rhode Island prosecutors presented the case to a grand jury who returned an indictment, and in July 1981, he was charged with two counts of attempted murder.

===First trial===
The case attracted nationwide publicity in the United States. The trial began in February 1982. Evidence presented by the prosecution consisted of circumstantial evidence, imputation of financial motive, extensive testimony by various maids, including Maria Schrallhammer who was a prominent witness at both trials, chauffeurs, doctors, and personal exercise trainers, a black bag with drugs, and a used syringe, reported to contain traces of insulin, found in Claus von Bülow&#x27;s mansion. There was much evidence of excessive use of sedatives, vitamins, and other drugs by her, including testimony of alcohol and substance abuse problems. Harvard endocrinologist George Cahill testified that he was convinced that her brain damage was the result of injected insulin. Claus von Bülow was convicted.

===Appeal===
Claus von Bülow hired Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz for his appeal. Dershowitz&#x27;s campaign to acquit him was assisted by the then Harvard Law School student and later television personality Jim Cramer; Cramer felt then and later wrote publicly that von Bülow was &quot;supremely guilty&quot; of the crime. Dershowitz and his other attorneys produced evidence of Sunny von Bülow&#x27;s excessive drug use, including testimony by both Truman Capote and Joanne Carson (second wife of Johnny Carson) and more than ten of Sunny&#x27;s friends. Some of the expert witness testimony was excluded as hypothetical or hearsay. Additional expert witness testimony cast doubt on the validity of evidence that a syringe contained traces of insulin. The appeals court quashed the conviction on several grounds, including the appellate court&#x27;s ruling that justice for the accused should override attorney–client privilege; and that therefore the notes taken by Kuh, the Auersperg children&#x27;s attorney, should be disclosed. These notes called into question the credibility of her maid, Ms. Schrallhammer, who had been a key witness for the prosecution.

At the second trial the defense called nine medical experts, all world-renowned university professors, who testified that the two comas were not caused by insulin, but by a combination of ingested (not injected) drugs, alcohol, and her chronic health conditions. The experts were John Caronna (vice chairman of neurology, Cornell); Leo Dal Cortivo (former president, U.S. Toxicology Association); Ralph DeFronzo (medicine, Yale); Kurt Dubowski (forensic pathology, University of Oklahoma); Daniel Foster (medicine, University of Texas); Daniel Furst, (medicine, University of Iowa); Harold Lebovitz (director of clinical research, State University of New York); Vincent Marks (clinical biochemistry, Surrey, vice-president Royal College of Pathologists and president, Association of Clinical Biochemistry); and Arthur Rubinstein (medicine, University of Chicago).

Other experts testified that the hypodermic needle tainted with insulin on the outside (but not inside) would have been dipped in insulin but not injected (injecting it in flesh would have wiped it clean). Evidence also showed that her hospital admission three weeks before the final coma showed she had ingested at least 73 aspirin tablets, a quantity that could only have been self-administered, and which indicated her state of mind.

Cahill recanted his testimony from the first trial and opined that insulin was the most reasonable explanation for von Bülow&#x27;s coma, but that &quot;neither he nor anyone else could ever be 100 percent certain of the cause of the comas.&quot;

===Aftermath===
Sunny&#x27;s family remained convinced that her husband had tried to murder her and was upset that Cosima had chosen to take her father&#x27;s side. As a result, in 1981, Sunny&#x27;s mother, Annie Laurie Aitken, disinherited Cosima, denying her share of the estate upon Aitken&#x27;s death on May 4, 1984. In July 1985, ten days after Claus von Bülow was acquitted at his second trial, Ala and Alexander filed a $56 million civil lawsuit against him, on their mother&#x27;s behalf. On December 24, 1987, this case was settled out of court when Claus von Bülow agreed to divorce her, give up all claims to her fortune, then estimated between $25 million and $40 million, and leave the country. In exchange, Cosima was reinstated in Aitken&#x27;s will and received $30 million as her one-third share of the estate.

After the trials, Ala and Alexander founded the Sunny von Bülow National Victim Advocacy Center in Fort Worth, Texas, now the National Center for Victims of Crime in Washington, DC, and the Sunny von Bülow Coma and Head Trauma Research Foundation in New York.

===Death===
Sunny remained in a persistent vegetative state until her death from cardiopulmonary arrest on December 6, 2008, at Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in New York City. Her memorial service, given by her three children, was held on January 14, 2009, at the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York which was the same church where the von Bülows married. She is buried near her mother at St. Mary’s Episcopal Church in Portsmouth, RI.

==In popular culture==
*Alan Dershowitz, Claus&#x27;s attorney, wrote a book about the case, &quot;Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von Bülow Case&quot; (New York, Random House 1986 and London, Penguin Books 1991).
*The 1990 film &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot; was based on Dershowitz&#x27;s books about the case, with Glenn Close playing Sunny and Jeremy Irons playing Claus von Bülow, a performance for which he was awarded an Academy Award for Best Actor.
*Bill Kurtis narrated an episode of the series &quot;American Justice&quot; titled &quot;Von Bulow: A Wealth of Evidence&quot;.
*The American television series &quot;Biography&quot; produced and aired a documentary episode titled &quot;Claus von Bülow: A Reasonable Doubt&quot;, with interviews of Claus Von Bülow and Alan Dershowitz.
*The case is referenced in the Seinfeld episode &quot;The Suicide&quot;. Jerry Seinfeld is in a hospital room watching over a comatose neighbor. To the neighbor&#x27;s ex-girlfriend he remarked &quot;It&#x27;s not like a Sunny Von Bülow coma. Doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.&quot;

<doc id="755134" wikidata="Q1483547" url="?curid=755134" title="Starčevo culture">
<text>The Starčevo culture is an archaeological culture of Southeastern Europe, dating to the Neolithic period between &quot;c.&quot; 6200 and 4500 BCE. It originates in the spread of the Neolithic package of peoples and technological innovations including farming and ceramics from Anatolia to the area of Sesklo. The Starčevo culture marks its spread to the inland Balkan peninsula as the Cardial ware culture did along the Adriatic coastline. It forms part of the wider Starčevo–Körös–Criş culture which gave rise to the central European Linear Pottery culture c. 700 years after the initial spread of Neolithic farmers towards the northern Balkans. 

The Starčevo site, the type site, is located on the north bank of the Danube near the village of Starčevo in Serbia (Vojvodina province), opposite Belgrade.

== Origins ==

The Starčevo culture represents a northern expansion of Early Neolithic Farmers who settled from Anatolia to present-day central Greece and expanded northwards. It forms part of the wider Starčevo–Körös–Criș culture. The river routes which traverse present-day North Macedonia have been suggested as the potential path of the movement of peoples and farming knowledge. The Sesklo site has been generally viewed as the direct point of northwards expansion, but in 2020 radiocarbon dating across several sites showed that the site in Mavropigi (ca. 180 northwest of Sesklo) is a much more probable point of origin of the population movement along the river routes towards the central Balkans. As of 2020, the two oldest dated sites are Crkvina near Miokovci, Serbia and Runik, Kosovo which are statistically indistinguishable to each other and have been dated to ca. 6238 BCE (6362-6098 BCE at 95% CI) and ca. 6185 BCE (6325–6088 BCE at 95% Cl) respectively. 

These two earliest sites were followed by a second cluster of sites that developed ca. 6200-6000 BCE in southern and central Serbia. The next expansion is located in eastern Serbia (Lepenski Vir) ca. 6100 BCE and since ca. 6000 BCE another cluster of settlements appears in northern Serbia. This general route of expansion suggests a wave of expansion model along river routes like the Morava Valley, but it is not a strictly defined model as not all northern sites are of a later date in comparison to sites to the south of them and vice versa.

===Archaeogenetics===
In a 2017 genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot;, the remains of five males ascribed to the early Starčevo culture from Hungary were analyzed. With regards to Y-DNA extracted, three belonged to subclades of G2a2, and two belonged to H2. mtDNA extracted were subclades of T1a2, K1a4a1, N1a1a1, W5 and X2d1. A 2018 study published in &quot;Nature&quot; analyzed three samples from Croatia and one from Serbia, they belonged to Y-DNA haplogroup C-CTS3151, H2-L281 and I2 while mtDNA haplogroup J1c2, K1a4a1, U5b2b and U8b1b1. In 2022 were analysed two samples, female from Grad-Starčevo with mtDNA haplogroup T2e2 and male from Vinča-Belo Brdo with Y-DNA haplogroup G2a2a1a3 and mtDNA haplogroup HV-16311. According to ADMIXTURE analysis, Starčevo samples had approximately 87-100% Early European Farmers, 0-9% Western Hunter-Gatherer and 0-10% Western Steppe Herders-related ancestry. A 2024 study published in &quot;Nature Human Behaviour&quot; tested 17 samples from Serbia, Croatia, Romania and Hungary, found Y-DNA haplogroups were G2a2b, G2a2b2a1a1c, G2a2a1a, G2a2a1a2a2a1, C1a2 (x2), R1b, H and F, while mtDNA haplogroups were H (x2), HV0a, J1c, J1b1, J2b1, J2b1d, K1a2, K1a4, K1a5, K1b1, K2, N1a1a, T2b (x2) and T2e.

==Characteristics and related cultures==

The pottery is usually coarse but finer fluted and painted vessels later emerged. A type of bone spatula, perhaps for scooping flour, is a distinctive artifact. The Körös is a similar culture in Hungary named after the River Körös with a closely related culture which also used footed vessels but fewer painted ones. Both have given their names to the wider culture of the region in that period.

Parallel and closely related cultures also include the Karanovo culture in Bulgaria, Criş in Romania and the pre-Sesklo in Greece.

==Sites==

The Starčevo culture covered a sizable area that included much of present-day western and southern Serbia, Montenegro (except for the coastal region), Kosovo, parts of eastern Albania, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, western Bulgaria, eastern Croatia, Hungary, North Macedonia and Romania.

The westernmost locality of this culture can be found in Croatia, in the vicinity of Ždralovi, a part of the town of Bjelovar. The region of Slavonia in present-day Croatia is the westernmost area of settlement of the Starčevo culture. Between 6200-5500 BCE, this area saw intensive habitation and land use organized around Zadubravlje, Galovo, Sarvaš, Pepelane, Stari Perkovci and other sites. This was the final stage of the culture. Findings from Ždralovi belong to a regional subtype of the final variant in the long process of development of that Neolithic culture.

In 1990, Starčevo was added to the Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance list, protected by Republic of Serbia.

In Kosovo, the Starčevo material culture has been found in pre-Vinca layers in the sites of Vlashnjë and Runik.

<doc id="755137" wikidata="Q2555235" url="?curid=755137" title="My Favourite Headache">
<text>My Favourite Headache (also published as My Favorite Headache, especially in the US) is the debut solo album by Geddy Lee of Canadian rock band Rush. The album was released on November 14, 2000, by Anthem Records in Canada and Atlantic Records outside of Canada. Both the title track and &quot;Grace to Grace&quot; received play on mainstream rock radio.

==Background==
Although Lee wrote the majority of the album on bass, he was not just writing melody lines, he was also playing chords. In some cases, he multi-tracked basses into different layers of the arrangements.
Lee said of the album: &quot;I think I backed into this project. I&#x27;ve never had a great desire to make an individual statement, and I certainly didn&#x27;t want any more attention. I satisfy so much of my musical self in the context of Rush, so I don&#x27;t have any great frustrations from that point of view. But once in a while, you&#x27;d wonder, &#x27;What&#x27;s it like out there? What&#x27;s it like to work with other people?&#x27;&quot;.
Lee explaining how he wrote the lyrics for &quot;My Favourite Headache&quot;: &quot;Most people are like this: They think of stuff during the day. The mind goes to certain places, they remember things, and they try to figure things out. To remind yourself to write that stuff down is a great benefit. Then you come back to it and you analyze it days later, and lyrically shape what you felt when you wrote it down. For me, how I feel about what I wrote down turns into a song.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;My Favourite Headache&quot; peaked at No. 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also reached No. 10 on Canada&#x27;s Metal Albums chart.

<text>Ulf Svante von Euler (7 February 1905 – 9 March 1983) was a Swedish physiologist and pharmacologist. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970 for his work on neurotransmitters.

==Life==
Ulf Svante von Euler-Chelpin was born in Stockholm, the son of two noted scientists, Hans von Euler-Chelpin, a professor of chemistry, and Astrid Cleve, a professor of botany and geology. His father was German and the recipient of Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1929, and his maternal grandfather was Per Teodor Cleve, Professor of Chemistry at the Uppsala University, and the discoverer of the chemical elements thulium and holmium. 
Von Euler-Chelpin studied medicine at the Karolinska Institute in 1922. At Karolinska, he worked under Robin Fåhraeus in blood sedimentation and rheology and did research work on the pathophysiology of vasoconstriction. He presented his doctoral thesis in 1930, and was appointed as assistant professor in pharmacology in the same year, with the support of G. Liljestrand. From 1930 to 1931, von Euler-Chelpin got a Rochester Fellowship to do his post-doctoral studies abroad. He studied in England with Sir Henry Dale in London and with I. de Burgh Daly in Birmingham, and then proceeded to the continent, studying with Corneille Heymans in Ghent, Belgium and with Gustav Embden in Frankfurt, Germany. Von Euler liked to travel, so he also worked and learned biophysics with Archibald Vivian Hill, again in London in 1934, and neuromuscular transmission with G. L. Brown in 1938. From 1946 to 1947, he worked with Eduardo Braun-Menéndez in the Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental in Buenos Aires, which was founded by Bernardo Houssay. His unerring instinct to work with important scientific leaders and fields was to be proved by the fact that Dale, Heymans, Hill and Houssay went to receive the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine.

In 1981, von Euler became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

From 1930 to 1957, von Euler was married to Jane Anna Margarethe Sodenstierna (1905–2004). They had four children: Hans Leo, scientist administrator at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.; Johan Christopher, anesthesiologist, Serafimer Hospital, Stockholm; Ursula Katarina, Ph.D., curator at The Royal Collections, The Royal Court, Stockholm, Sweden; and Marie Jane, Chemical Engineer, Melbourne, Australia. In 1958, von Euler married countess Dagmar Cronstedt, a radio broadcaster who had during the Second World War worked at Radio Königsberg, broadcasting German propaganda to neutral Sweden.

==Research==
His short stay as a postdoctoral student in Dale&#x27;s laboratory was very fruitful: in 1931 he discovered with John H. Gaddum an important autopharmacological principle, substance P. After returning to Stockholm, von Euler pursued further this line of research, and successively discovered four other important endogenous active substances, prostaglandin, vesiglandin (1935), piperidine (1942) and noradrenaline (1946).

In 1939 von Euler was appointed full professor of physiology at the Karolinska Institute, where he remained until 1971. His early collaboration with Liljestrand had led to an important discovery, which was named the Euler–Liljestrand mechanism (a physiological arterial shunt in response to the decrease in local oxygenation of the lungs).

From 1946 on, however, when noradrenaline (abbreviated NA or NAd) was discovered, von Euler devoted most of his research work to this area. He and his group studied thoroughly its distribution and fate in biological tissues and in the nervous system in physiological and pathological conditions, and found that noradrenaline was produced and stored in nerve synaptic terminals in intracellular vesicles, a key discovery which changed dramatically the course of many researches in the field. In 1970 he was distinguished with the Nobel Prize for his work, jointly with Sir Bernard Katz and Julius Axelrod. Since 1953 he was very active in the Nobel Foundation, being a member of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine and chairman of the board since 1965. He also served as vice-president of the International Union of Physiological Sciences from 1965 to 1971. Among the many honorary titles and prizes he received in addition to the Nobel, were the Gairdner Prize (1961), the Jahre Prize (1965), the Stouffer Prize (1967), the Carl Ludwig Medaille (1953), the Schmiedeberg Plaquette (1969), La Madonnina (1970), many honorary doctorates from universities around the world, and the membership to several erudite, medical and scientific societies. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1970, a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1972, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1973.

<text>Yuli Mikhailovich Vorontsov (also Yuliy Vorontsov; ) (October 7, 1929, Leningrad  – December 12, 2007, Moscow) was a Soviet and Russian diplomat, President of International Centre of the Roerichs (Moscow). In the mid-1970s he was Chargé d&#x27;Affaires at the Soviet embassy in Washington under Ambassador Dobrynin. He was then Ambassador to India (1978-1983) and France (1983-1986). He returned to Moscow to be the first deputy foreign minister (1986-1990) and participated in arms reduction talks with the United States. In 1988-1989, he was simultaneously the Ambassador to Afghanistan as Soviet troops withdrew from the country. He then served as the last Soviet ambassador to United Nations between 1990 and 1991 and as the first Russian Permanent Representative to the UN from 1991 to 1994. After this he served as the Russian ambassador to the United States from 1994 to 1998. In 2000 Vorontsov was chosen as the high-level coordinator for issues related to a paragraph of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284 which once again required Iraq to face &quot;its obligations regarding the repatriation or return of all Kuwaiti and third country nationals or their remains, [and] the return of all Kuwaiti property [...] seized by Iraq&quot; (during the invasion of Kuwait).

<text>Wilfrid Voynich (born Michał Habdank-Wojnicz; – 19 March 1930) was a Polish revolutionary, antiquarian and bibliophile. Voynich operated one of the largest rare book businesses in the world. He is remembered as the eponym of the Voynich manuscript.

==Life==
Michał Habdank-Wojnicz was born in the town of Telšiai in present-day Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire, into a Polish noble family. The &quot;Habdank&quot; part of his surname is the name of a Polish heraldic clan. He was the son of a Polish petty official (titular counsellor).

He attended a &quot;gimnazjum&quot; in Suwałki (a town in northeastern Poland), then studied at the university of Warsaw, St. Petersburg, and Moscow. He graduated from Moscow University in chemistry and became a licensed pharmacist.

In 1885, in Warsaw, Wojnicz joined Ludwik Waryński&#x27;s revolutionary organization, &quot;Proletariat&quot;. In 1886, after a failed attempt to free fellow-conspirators (1846–1886) and Stanisław Kunicki (1861–1886), who had both been sentenced to death, from the Warsaw Citadel, he was arrested by the Russian police. In 1887, he was sent to penal servitude at Tunka near Irkutsk in Siberia.

Whilst in Siberia, Voynich acquired a working knowledge of eighteen different languages, albeit not well.

In June 1890 he escaped from Siberia and travelling west by train got to Hamburg, eventually arriving in London in October 1890.
Under the assumed name of Ivan Kel&#x27;chevskii at first, he worked with Sergius Stepniak, a fellow revolutionary, under the banner of the anti-tsarist Society of Friends of Russian Freedom in London. After Stepniak&#x27;s death in a railway crossing accident in 1895, Voynich ceased revolutionary activity.

Voynich became an antiquarian bookseller from around 1897, acting on the advice of Richard Garnett, a curator at the British Museum. Voynich opened a bookshop at Soho Square in London in 1898. He was remarkably lucky in finding rare books, including a Malermi Bible in Italy in 1902.

In 1902 he married a fellow former revolutionary, Ethel Lilian Boole, daughter of the British mathematician George Boole, with whom Voynich had been associated since 1890. Voynich was naturalised as a British subject on 25 April 1904, taking the legal name Wilfrid Michael Voynich.

Voynich opened another bookshop in 1914 in New York. With the onset of the First World War, Voynich was increasingly based in New York. He became deeply involved in the antiquarian book trade, and wrote a number of catalogues and other texts on the subject.

Voynich relocated his London bookshop to 175 Piccadilly in 1917. Also in 1917, based on rumours, Voynich was investigated by the FBI, in relation to his possession of Bacon&#x27;s cipher. The report also noted that he dealt with manuscripts from the 13th, 12th, and 11th centuries, and that the value of his books at the time was half a million dollars. However, the investigation did not reveal anything significant beyond the fact that he possessed a secret code nearly a millennium old.

Voynich died at Roosevelt Hospital in New York, in 1930, of lung cancer.

==Voynich manuscript==

The most famous of Voynich&#x27;s possessions was a mysterious manuscript he said he acquired in 1912 at the Villa Mondragone in Italy, but first presented in public in 1915. The book has been carbon-dated, which revealed that the materials were manufactured sometime between 1404 and 1438. He owned the manuscript until his death.

<doc id="755169" wikidata="Q5297469" url="?curid=755169" title="Dorado Wings">
<text>Dorado Wings was a small commuter airline that operated from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Dorado Airport in the tourist center of Dorado, Puerto Rico. Dorado Wings was the only commercial operator at Dorado Airport. Dorado Wings existed under that name from 1964 to 1981. In early 1981, the airline was purchased and its name was changed to Crown Air which operated until 1988. 

Commuter turboprop and prop aircraft operated by Dorado Wings during its existence included:

* 13 Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander (BN-2A models)
* 5 de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter
* 3 Handley Page Jetstream
* 1 Piper Navajo
* 1 Swearingen Metroliner

Flights from San Juan to Dorado took 15 minutes. Because of the shortness of their flights, Dorado Wings airplanes were a constant sight every day at many airports throughout this part of the Caribbean. Airports served in Puerto Rico were San Juan International (SJU), Isla Grande (SIG), Dorado Beach (DBA), Mayagüez (MAZ), Palmas Del Mar (PDM) and Aguadilla (BQN) (former Ramey Air Force Base). Other Caribbean airports served were St. Thomas (STT), St. Croix (STX), Tortola/Beef Island BVI (EIS), Virgin Gorda BVI (VIJ), St. Kitts (SKB), St. Maarten/St. Martin (SXM), St. Barts (SBH) and Anguilla (AXA). Still more airports were served on a charter basis.

==Incidents and accidents==
In 1981, a Dorado Wings airplane suffered an accident on a non revenue flight after takeoff at San Juan airport. There were no major injuries or fatalities, though the aircraft was totaled. 

The airline was, at the time, part of a group of smaller Puerto Rican airlines that were seen commonly at San Juan&#x27;s international airport. These also included Flamenco Airways, Prinair, Oceanair and Vieques Air Link, of which, as of 2012, only Vieques Air Link and Flamenco Airways survived (Prinair returned to the skies during 2019).

<text>Samuel Livermore (May 14, 1732May 18, 1803) was an American politician, who served as the U.S. Senator from New Hampshire from 1793 to 1801 and served as the President pro tempore of the United States Senate in 1796 and again in 1799.

==Life and career==
Livermore was born in Waltham in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, the son of Hannah (Brown) and Samuel Livermore, and attended Waltham schools. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1752, then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1756, and commenced practice in Waltham. He moved to Portsmouth, in 1758 and later to Londonderry. He was a member of the New Hampshire General Court (the state&#x27;s general assembly) 1768–1769. He was judge-advocate in the Admiralty court and Attorney General from 1769 to 1774. He moved to Holderness in 1775 and was State attorney for three years.

Livermore was a Member of the Continental Congress from 1780 to 1782 and again from 1785 to 1786. He was chief justice of the New Hampshire Superior Court of Judicature from 1782 to 1789, and a member of the State constitutional convention in 1788. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives for the First and Second Congresses, serving from March 4, 1789, to March 4, 1793, and served as the chairman of the House Committee on Elections in the Second Congress. Livermore was one of seven representatives to vote against the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793.

Livermore was president of the State constitutional convention in 1791 and in 1792 was elected as a Federalist to the United States Senate and was reelected in 1798 and served from March 4, 1793, until his resignation effective June 12, 1801, due to ill health. He served as president pro tempore of the Senate during the Fourth and Sixth Congresses. The defunct town of Livermore, New Hampshire was named after him.

Livermore died in Holderness, New Hampshire, and is interred in Trinity Churchyard there. He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 39) along New Hampshire Route 175 in Holderness.

Livermore was the father of Arthur Livermore, a U.S. Representative from New Hampshire, and Edward St. Loe Livermore, a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts.

<text>Li Yuanhong (; courtesy name ; October 19, 1864 – June 3, 1928) was a prominent Chinese military and political leader during the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China. He was the Provisional Vice President of the Republic of China from 1912 to 1913 as well as the president of the Republic of China between 1916 and 1917, and between 1922 and 1923.

He was born in Huangpi, Hubei. Li initially pursued a military career, graduating from the Tianjin Military Academy in 1896. His leadership and military acumen quickly earned him recognition, leading to his involvement in significant historical events, including the 1911 Revolution that ended over two hundred years of Qing rule in China. Li&#x27;s role in the revolution, particularly his reluctant yet crucial leadership of the Wuchang Uprising, established him as a key figure in the new Republic.

In the early years of the Republic, Li held several important positions, including serving as Vice President and later as President. His tenure was marked by efforts to stabilize the new republic amidst internal strife and external pressures. His first presidency (1916-1917) ended abruptly due to a coup by the warlord Zhang Xun, who attempted to restore the Qing Dynasty. Li was restored to the presidency in 1917 but struggled to assert control in the fragmented political environment.

Li&#x27;s later years were spent in relative obscurity after retiring from political life following his second term as president. He continued to be respected for his contributions to the establishment of the Republic of China and his commitment to constitutionalism and national unity. Li died in Tianjin, leaving behind a legacy of cautious yet principled leadership during one of China&#x27;s most turbulent periods. His efforts to bridge the old imperial order and the new republican era are remembered as a testament to his dedication to his country.

== Early life ==
A native of Huangpi, Hubei, he was the son of a Qing veteran of the Taiping Rebellion named Li Chaoxiang (). He graduated from the Tianjin naval academy in 1889 and served as an engineer in the First Sino-Japanese war. His cruiser was sunk and he survived because of his life belt, since he could not swim. He later joined the Hubei New Army and became senior military officer in Hankou. In 1910, he attempted to break up revolutionary rings that infiltrated his 21st Mixed Brigade. He did not arrest anyone caught in subversive activities, but simply dismissed them.

== National prominence ==
When the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 broke out, the Wuchang mutineers needed a visible high-ranking officer to be their figurehead. Li was well respected, had supported the Railway Protection Movement, and knew English, which would be useful in dealing with foreign concerns. He was reportedly dragged from hiding under his wife&#x27;s bed and forced at gunpoint to be the provisional military governor of Hubei despite killing several of the rebels. Though reluctant at first, he embraced the revolution after its growing momentum and was named military governor of China on 30 November. Qing Premier Yuan Shikai negotiated a truce with him on 4 December.

While Li commanded the rebel army, Sun Yat-sen of the Revolutionary Alliance became the first provisional president in Nanjing on 1 January 1912. Li was made vice president as a compromise and he formed People&#x27;s Society to campaign for the presidency. Meanwhile, the north was still under the control of the Qing. A negotiation made Sun step down in favor of Yuan Shikai as president with Li keeping his vice-presidency. This ended the Qing dynasty and reunified north and south China. People&#x27;s Society later merged with the pro-Yuan Republican Party.

In 1913, he combined the Republicans with Liang Qichao&#x27;s Democratic Party to form the Progressive Party. The Progressives became the biggest rivals to the opposition Nationalists led by Sun. He supported Yuan against Sun during the Second Revolution which earned him the enmity of his former comrades. When Yuan pulled off his presidential coup, Li was viewed as a potential threat and confined in Beijing where he became a passive bystander under Yuan&#x27;s grip. Yuan could never fully trust Li because he wasn&#x27;t a protégé within the Beiyang Army&#x27;s inner circle and because of his past association with the revolutionaries. Nevertheless, Yuan married his son to Li&#x27;s daughter to strengthen their ties. Li kept his office and honors as vice president but had no power. Some factions called on Li to claim the presidency when Yuan crowned himself emperor in 1916. He refused for fear of his life but he also declined the aristocratic title of Prince granted by Yuan in the Empire of China (1915–16), a decision which would help his standing later on. Li remained in self-imposed isolation at his residence during the monarchic period, and until the death of Yuan.

== Presidency and later life ==
Li served as president from 7 June 1916 to 17 July 1917. When Yuan died, he left a will containing Li&#x27;s name along with Premier Duan Qirui and Xu Shichang. The will was an imperial tradition started by the Kangxi Emperor, and was not constitutional in the republic. Nevertheless, the Beiyang generals pressed Li into office, since he was acceptable to the rebellious southern provinces. Li tried to return to the 1912 constitutional arrangement, but Duan held the real power. The National Assembly of the Republic of China reconvened on 1 August 1916, after having been disbanded over two and a half years earlier. Duan was eager to pull China into World War I but Li was more hesitant. They conflicted greatly over Duan&#x27;s decision to cut ties with Germany. Li forced Duan to resign on 23 May 1917, when the premier&#x27;s secret loans from Japan were exposed. Duan fled to Tianjin to muster his forces, and most generals abandoned the government. In response, Li asked General Zhang Xun for assistance. In exchange, Zhang asked for the dissolution of parliament which was granted on 13 June. Zhang, who was secretly pro-German, unexpectedly occupied Beijing from 14 June to 12 July 1917 and kept the president prisoner. Zhang then proceeded with a move that would undermine most of his support when he attempted to restore Emperor Puyi and the Qing dynasty on 1 July. Li was released to the Japanese legation where he asked for Duan&#x27;s assistance in saving the republic. Duan overthrew Zhang within two weeks, and restored the republic by 12 July; Duan himself was reinstated as premier by 14 July. Vice President Feng Guozhang was made acting president in Nanjing. On 17 July, distraught from recent events, Li officially resigned from office and moved to Tianjin in retirement.

He served again as president of China between 11 June 1922 and 13 June 1923 after Cao Kun forced out President Xu Shichang. Li was chosen because he was respected by all of the factions and was hoped to reunify the country. He accepted only with the private assurances that warlord forces be disbanded; they were never honored. Like his first term, he called back the original National Assembly but he was even more powerless than before. He organized the &quot;Able Men Cabinet&quot; consisting of prestigious experts but it became undone when he arrested the finance minister for graft after examining rumours and circumstantial evidence; a court threw out the charges. Cao soon harbored presidential ambitions himself and orchestrated strikes to force Li out of office. Cao went as far as trying to bribe the assembly into impeaching him. When Li was vacating the capital, he attempted to take the presidential seal with him but was intercepted. He fled to Japan for medical treatment and returned to Tianjin in 1924 where he later died. His tomb, built in 1935 and restored in 2011, is situated on campus of Central China Normal University in Wuhan. He married Wu Jingjun (1870-1930) and had four children.

<text>Alberto Lleras Camargo (3 July 1906 – 4 January 1990) was President of Colombia twice (1945-1946, 1958–1962), and the 1st Secretary General of the Organization of American States (1948–1954). A journalist and liberal party politician, he also served as Minister of Government, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and as Minister of National Education in the administrations of President Alfonso López Pumarejo. He briefly attended the National University of Colombia in Bogotá to study politics, but dropped out later to pursue journalism.

Lleras Camargo served as congressman of Colombia. He was also a cousin of later president Carlos Lleras Restrepo. He died in 1990 after suffering a long illness.

==Early Political Career and First Presidency==

He attended the traditional Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Señora del Rosario. In 1929, he was elected deputy assemblyman on the Bogotá city council, his first entrance into politics. The following year he became Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Colombian Liberal Party and in 1931, he was elected to the Colombian Chamber of Representatives. That same year, he became the first Liberal to preside over the Chamber in more than forty years.

After Alfonso López Pumarejo was elected President of Colombia in 1934, Lleras Camargo was named Cabinet Secretary. In 1935, he became the Minister of Government, a position he occupied until the end of López Pumarejo’s presidential term in 1938. In 1938, he founded the newspaper &quot;El Liberal&quot;, which promoted López Pumarejo’s re-election. In 1941, he returned to and once again presided over the Chamber of Representatives. When López Pumarejo was re-elected president in 1942, he once again named Lleras Camargo the Minister of Government. Aside from a brief interruption in 1943, when Lleras Camargo became the Colombian Ambassador to the United States, he occupied that position until 1944, when intense political instability disrupted López Pumarejo’s presidency. In July 1944, after López Pumarejo stepped down, Lleras Camargo fought off a coup attempt against Darío Echandía, who had been temporarily designated as president.

In 1945, he became Minister of Foreign Relations, and in that capacity, represented Colombia at the Chapultepec Conference and the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, which created the United Nations. But that same year, the Senate named designated him as Acting President, a position he occupied until 1946, when Conservative Mariano Ospina Pérez was elected president. At only thirty-nine years-old, he became one of the youngest Acting Presidents in Colombian history. During his short year in office, the Greater Colombian Merchant Fleet was founded and the Constitutional Reform of 1945 completed.

==Founding of the Organization of American States==

After leaving the presidency in 1946, Lleras Camargo founded the highly regarded news magazine &quot;Semana&quot;. Owing to the respect and prestige he had earned as Minister of Foreign Relations and President of Colombia, he was named Director of the Pan American Union in 1947. He launched a restructuring effort, which culminated in the founding the Organization of American States in 1948. Lleras Camargo served as the first General Secretary between 1948-1949 and later completed a full five-year term between 1950 and 1954. During his second term, the organization became more consolidated as a hemispheric organization, with increased continental participation.

<text>Carlos Alberto Lleras Restrepo (12 April 1908 – 27 September 1994) was a Colombian politician and lawyer who served the 22nd President of Colombia from 1966 to 1970.

== Biographic data ==
Lleras was born in Bogotá, on 12 April 1908. He was the third son of the doctor physician and researcher, Federico Lleras and Amalia Restrepo. He died in Bogotá, on 27 September 1994.

== Early life ==
Lleras studied in La Salle Institute in Bogotá and later studied jurisprudence at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. He obtained his law degree in 1930. He was also a member of Phi Iota Alpha, the oldest inter-collegiate Greek-letter organization for international Latin American students.

== Private life ==
Lleras was a cousin of Alberto Lleras Camargo, another important Colombian politician and President of Colombia. He was married to Cecilia de la Fuente, with who he had four children. German Vargas Lleras is his grandson.

== Political career ==
Lleras became involved in politics at an early age. In 1929, he was elected by the liberal party as delegate to the National Convention of Apulo. By age 21 he was a member in the national committee of the Colombian Liberal Party. Lleras was elected to the state senate of Cundinamarca, and later MP as congressman in the House of Representatives.

In 1932, during the so-called &quot;“Liberal Republic”&quot;, Lleras was appointed General Comptroller of the country and in 1938 he was appointed as Minister of Finance (Ministro de Hacienda) during the presidency of Eduardo Santos. He was elected as Chairman of the Liberal Party several times and Senator of the Republic.

Lleras ran for president of Colombia for the first time in 1944, but his bid was unsuccessful. On 27 November 1965, he accepted the nomination of the liberal party, and received the endorsement of the conservative party. This made him the official candidate of the &quot;“National Front”&quot;, and he won the election in 1966.

After the presidency, Lleras founded and produced the political magazine &quot;“Nueva Frontera”&quot;.

==Presidency==
Lleras was inaugurated as President of Colombia on 7 August 1966, and called his administration &quot;the era of national transformation&quot; (&quot;Transformación Nacional&quot;).

During his administration, the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA) promoted the redistribution of usable land to the peasants and unemployed workers in the country, issuing more than 60,000 titles in 1968 and 1969 alone.

Lleras implemented an aggressive and broad program of social and economic reforms and created the following agencies and institutions: the national savings fund (&quot;Fondo Nacional del Ahorro&quot;); the Colombian Institute for the family wellbeing (&quot;Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar&quot;); the institute to protect non renewable resources (&quot;Instituto de Recursos Naturales no Renovables&quot;); the agency to promote exports (&quot;Fondo de Promoción de Exportaciones&quot; &#x27;PROEXPO&#x27;); the national agency of Colombian culture (&quot;Instituto Colombiano de Cultura&quot; &#x27;Colcultura&#x27;); the national agency for the construction of schools (&quot;Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones Escolares&quot; &#x27;Icce&#x27;); and the national institution to promote and finance superior education (&quot;Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educación Superior&quot; &#x27;Icfes&#x27;).

<text>James Tilghman Lloyd (August 28, 1857 – April 3, 1944) was a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Missouri from 1897 to 1917. He served as the House minority whip between 1901 and 1909.

Lloyd was born in Canton, Missouri, where he attended the public schools, and later graduated from Christian University (today Culver-Stockton College) in Canton. He taught school, was a deputy sheriff of Lewis County from 1879 to 1881, and deputy circuit clerk and recorder from 1880 to 1882. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1882, and started a practice in Monticello, before moving to Shelbyville in 1885. He was prosecuting attorney of Shelby County from 1889 to 1893.

Lloyd was elected as a Democrat to the Fifty-fifth Congress in a special election caused by the death of Representative-elect Richard P. Giles, and was reelected nine additional times. In Congress, he served as Democratic whip in the Fifty-seventh through Sixtieth Congresses, and chairman of the Committee on Accounts in the Sixty-second through Sixty-fourth Congresses. In 1916, he led the effort to pass the Lloyd–La Follette Act to provide federal employees with whistleblower protections. In party politics, he was a delegate to the 1908 Democratic National Convention, and served as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 1909 to 1913, during which time his party gained a majority in the House of Representatives.

After retiring from Congress in 1917, Lloyd remained in Washington, D.C. where he practiced law. He was president of the board of education in 1924 and 1925 and president of the chamber of commerce in 1925. He returned to Canton in 1925 and continued his law practice and was a member of the board of curators of Culver-Stockton College. He died in Quincy, Illinois on April 3, 1944, and was buried in Forest Grove Cemetery in Canton.

<text>James Smith Bush (June 15, 1825 – November 11, 1889) was an American attorney, Episcopal priest, religious writer, and an ancestor of the Bush political family. He was the father of business magnate Samuel P. Bush, grandfather of former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, great-grandfather of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and great-great-grandfather of former Texas Governor and President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.

==Biography==
James Smith Bush was born on June 15, 1825 in Rochester, New York, to Obadiah Newcomb Bush and Harriet Smith (1800–1867). In 1851, his father returned from the California Gold Rush after two years in order to reclaim his family and bring them west. He died on November 11, 1889 aboard a ship while on his return voyage in Itcha, New York and was presumably buried at sea. He was 64 years old.

===Yale College===
Bush entered Yale College in 1841 (class of 1844), the first of what would become a long family tradition, as his grandsons Prescott Sheldon Bush and James Bush, great-grandsons George H. W. Bush, Prescott Sheldon Bush, Jr., Jonathan Bush and William H. T. Bush, great great-grandson George W. Bush, and great-great-great-granddaughter Barbara are all Yale alumni. He is accounted among the over 300 Yale alumni and faculty who supported in 1883 the founding of Wolf&#x27;s Head Society. After Yale, he returned to Rochester and studied law, joining the bar in 1847.

===First marriage===
His first wife, Sarah Freeman, lived in Saratoga Springs. They married in 1851, but she died 18 months later during childbirth.

This prompted Bush to study divinity with the rector of the Episcopal church there. Ordained a deacon in 1855, he was appointed rector at the newly organized Grace Church in Orange, New Jersey.

===Second marriage===
On February 24, 1859, he married Harriet Eleanor [Fay], daughter of Samuel Howard and Susan [Shellman] Fay, at Trinity Church, New York City. Fay was born in Savannah, Georgia. Her father is the sixth generation removed to John Fay, immigrant patriarch, born in England abt. 1648, embarking on May 30, 1656, at Gravesend on the ship &quot;Speedwell&quot;, and arrived in Boston June 27, 1656.

====Children====
:# James Freeman, b. June 15, 1860, Essex Co., NJ
:# Samuel Prescott, b. October 4, 1863, Orange., NJ
:# Harold Montfort, b. November 14, 1871, Dansville, NY
:# Eleanor Howard, b. November 7, 1873, Staten Island, NY

:Samuel was named after Harriet Fay&#x27;s grandfather, Samuel Prescott Phillips Fay.

===Career===
In 1865–66, having been given a health sabbatical by his church, he traveled to San Francisco via the Straits of Magellan on the ironclad monitor with Commodore John Rodgers (a parishioner of his), with international goodwill stops along the way. Officially, he was designated Commodore&#x27;s Secretary, but was considered &quot;acting chaplain&quot;, giving services on board and even conducting a shipboard wedding for a German American they encountered in Montevideo, an incident Bush recounted in dispatches he wrote for &quot;The Overland Monthly&quot;. Coincidentally, the fleet observed the punitive shelling of a defenseless Valparaíso, Chile by the Spanish Navy during the Chincha Islands War, after mediation efforts by Rodgers failed.

In 1867–1872, Bush was called to Grace Church (later Cathedral) in San Francisco, but troubled by family obligations, only stayed five years. His short stay along with that of photographic roll film inventor Hannibal Goodwin was to be satirized by Mark Twain in his weekly column in &quot;The Californian&quot;.

In 1872, Bush took a call from Church of the Ascension at West Brighton, Staten Island. In 1884, during a dispute over a church raffle (a gold watch was auctioned, which he considered gambling), he stepped down.

In 1883, Bush published a collection of sermons called &quot;More Words About the Bible&quot;, a response to his colleague Heber Newton&#x27;s book &quot;Right and Wrong Uses of the Bible&quot;. In 1885, his book &quot;Evidence of Faith&quot; was reviewed by &quot;The Literary World&quot; as &quot;clear, simple, and unpretending&quot;, and summarized as an argument against supernatural explanations for God. According to the same journal, both works fit into the broad church movement. The &quot;Boston Advertiser&quot; called the latter work &quot;the best statement of untrammeled spiritual thought&quot; among recent books.

Bush retired to Concord, Massachusetts, and in 1888 left the Episcopal Church altogether and became a Unitarian. The stress of this separation caused him health problems for the remainder of his life. He moved to Ithaca, New York where he died suddenly while raking leaves in 1889.

<text>Wooster School is a private, co-educational, college-preparatory school (grades 5 through 12) in Danbury, Connecticut. It is a member of the Connecticut Association of Independent Schools.

==Overview==
The Wooster School motto is &quot;Ex Quoque Potestate, Cuique Pro Necessitate&quot;, roughly, &quot;From each according to ability, to each according to need&quot;. Founded in 1926 as a boys&#x27; school of 10 students by Episcopal priest Dr. Aaron Coburn, it is named for General David Wooster, who fought at the Battle of Ridgefield with the Patriots in the American Revolution. The school continues the legacy of the jobs program, in which the entire student body engages in a daily period dedicated to cleaning and physically maintaining the campus.

Girls were first admitted to the school in the fall of 1970. In 1990, Wooster School transitioned from being a boarding school, as it had been since its inception, to being a day school. 
===21st-century changes===
Since 2000, one of the National Association of Episcopal Schools&#x27; top two educator awards is named for former Wooster School head John D. Verdery.

From 2001 to 2004, Wooster School made some improvements to its physical plant, notably the addition of a new gymnasium and a distinct Middle School building.

== Tuition ==
Wooster offers a program of variable tuition to families unable to pay full tuition. Full tuition for the 2023-2024 academic year was as follows:
==Notable alumni==
*Tracy Chapman—folk singer and guitarist
*Andrew Stevovich—painter
*Cyrus Mehri—trial attorney
*Zachary Cole Smith—singer
*Neil Rudenstine—president of Harvard University

<doc id="755195" wikidata="Q17030392" url="?curid=755195" title="The Vicar of Bray (song)">
<text>&quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot; is an eighteenth century satirical song recounting the career of The Vicar of Bray and his contortions of principle in order to retain his ecclesiastic office despite the changes in the Established Church through the course of several English monarchs. The song makes many specific allusions to English religious and political doctrines and events.

==Origins and cultural influence==

The generally known form of the song appears to have been based on an earlier version, &quot;The Religious Turncoat; Or, the Trimming Parson&quot;.

The melody is taken from the 17th-century folk melody &quot;Country Gardens&quot; which in turn was used in &quot;The Quaker&#x27;s Opera&quot;, first printed in London in 1728, a three-act farce based on the story of Jack Sheppard which was performed at Bartholomew Fair.

A parody of this parody song, &quot;The American Vicar of Bray&quot;, with the same chorus, was published in the 30 June 1779 edition of Rivington&#x27;s &quot;Royal Gazette&quot;, mocking the shifting loyalties of some American colonists during the American Revolutionary War.

&quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot; is also referenced in the song &quot;Parlour Songs&quot; in the Stephen Sondheim musical, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, although the song has been removed from more recent performances of that musical.

==Notes==

===High Church===

The division of the English church into &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; was significant at the time of the Restoration. The High Church resisted the Calvinistic levelling of church hierarchy that had been seen in the Commonwealth. The High Church party supported the divine right of kings, episcopal church government, and establishment of the Church of England by the civil government. It was primarily Tory, and was more hierarchical than either the &quot;low&quot; (more Puritan/Presbyterian) or &quot;broad&quot; (latitudinarian or tolerant) churches. High Church in the late 17th century should not be confused with the liturgical changes sought by the Anglo-Catholic/Oxford Movement in the 19th century. Puritans, Presbyterians and Baptists favoured plainer, less sacramental, more scriptural liturgy in every era. However restoration of the Catholic style liturgy (often called &#x27;High Church&#x27;) in the Church of England is primarily a 19th-century phenomenon. In the 17th century, the High Church was devoted to the King&#x27;s church: meaning that the King of England was not only the head of the church, but that the church&#x27;s very holiness was imbued into the King&#x27;s person. Therefore, the King of England was not, in some sense, an ordinary mortal.

The Vicar of Bray comically adapts his political and ecclesiastical beliefs to fit the successively ascendant government and church parties of his day.

===Preferment===

Appointment to an ecclesiastical office, or the position itself; in this case the benefice of Bray. A candidate for an ecclesiastical position was &quot;preferred&quot; over others for it by those with the right of appointment: these could be church superiors, or often nobles or institutions such as Oxbridge colleges (through their right to present a new incumbent to a benefice).

===Those who dare resist===

A reference to Oliver Cromwell and the regicides who tried and executed Charles I.

===Lord&#x27;s Anointed===

In this case, the King, anointed (by God) in the ceremony of coronation as temporal and spiritual leader of England; it draws from the Judeo-Christian Bible, I Samuel . King Charles I, who had been beheaded during the English Civil War had attempted to introduce the doctrine of Divine Right of Kings to England. After the rule of Oliver Cromwell, Charles II (son of Charles I) was restored to the throne. Charles II was more moderate than his father, but the leading political theorist of the absolutist side, Sir Robert Filmer (the target of John Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;), had argued that the king is appointed directly by God and is, &quot;by nature&quot;, inherently superior to those he ruled. Therefore, the king is anointed by God from birth (and not by the Archbishop at coronation). Charles II took no consistent position on divine right, but those who restored him did, and the High Church was ascending.

===Law===

The English Church is an &quot;Established&quot; Church, the state religion by Parliamentary law; at the time ecclesiastics could be removed for their religious and political opinions. This is the point of the song&#x27;s satire: the Vicar of Bray accommodated his beliefs to conciliate the current ruler and keep his office. During this period, a difficult question was the degree to which &quot;Non-conformist&quot; and &quot;Non-juror&quot; clerics could participate in the Established Church.

Non-conformists were those ministers who, though officially ordained and appointed, would not conform to the official liturgical practices. Though usually Puritans, they included many variations in religious practice.

Non-jurors were more threatening to the government, refusing to take the oath to the king as head of the church, as required by Parliament. Some Puritans felt that no man could lead a church, that divine law came from God directly to each believer. Others were of Roman Catholic leanings and did not recognise the English church&#x27;s right to separate from the rest of the communion. In particular, it would be inconsistent to take the oath under Charles II (the Test Act 1673) and also under William III and Mary II, as these two oaths were contradictory. Refusing the new oaths incurred suspicion of disloyalty, while successively swearing them was derided as spineless. The Vicar of Bray is in the latter camp.

===Popery===

Derogatory term for Roman Catholicism, as personified in the Pope; King James II was the first Catholic monarch of England since Mary I. James&#x27;s Catholic faith and attempts to revoke legal restrictions against his coreligionists caused an anti-Catholic Parliament to invite King James&#x27; daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange to rule England. William invaded England with a large army, while Parliament declared William III and Mary II to be joint King and Queen. After this Glorious Revolution, Parliament made Protestantism a condition for any monarch of Britain or Ireland.

Even after the defeat of his armies in Ireland, King James and the House of Stuart still had a large following throughout the British Isles. The new regime never felt entirely safe from civil war seeking to restore the deposed dynasty.

James&#x27;s son, living abroad, became known as The Old Pretender (see line 41), but his grandson, Charles (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;), The Young Pretender, proved a far more effective military commander and dangerous contender for the throne.

===Penal Laws and Declaration of Indulgence===

The Penal Laws were a series of laws which upheld the establishment of the Church of England against Protestant nonconformists and Catholics. Civil penalties were applied to those who did not conform. When James II of England and VII of Scotland issued two proclamations in 1687 (12 February in Scotland and 4 April in England), he granted broad religious freedom by suspending the penal laws. There was open resistance from Anglicans and few clergy read out the indulgence in Church. The Vicar of Bray was thus following the King rather than the Church.

===Jesuits===

A Roman Catholic religious order founded by Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the Jesuits were known for the excellence of their academic training, ability to argue effectively against Protestantism using the Bible, and personal vow of obedience to the Roman Pontiff. Therefore, from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England the priests of the Society of Jesus were especially feared and hated by the Protestants of the British Isles. English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh Protestants viewed the Jesuits as terrorists, assassins, and spies due to the Jesuit practice of sending missionaries incognito into Britain to minister to Catholics, spread the faith and bring back information. It was alleged (based on both hearsay and the convictions of Jesuits for involvement in the Gunpowder Plot (1605)) that the order incited revolt.

===Glorious Revolution===

The Glorious Revolution occurred soon after James II&#x27;s ascension to the throne in 1685. James had only been king for a matter three years before he fled. The Vicar, therefore, did not have long with his new faith. However, the Vicar was not alone in converting to open Roman Catholicism. John Dryden became Roman Catholic at this time (and was taunted by a version of the &quot;Vicar of Bray&quot; tale pre-dating this song), but he remained Roman Catholic to his death and defended his conversion publicly.

===Turn&#x27;d the cat in pan===

To change sides quickly and effortlessly. According to the Oxford English Dictionary: &quot;to reverse the order of things so dexterously as to make them appear the very opposite of what they really are; to turn a thing right about. &quot;Obs.&quot;&quot;.

===Allegiance===

When William and Mary came to the throne, many Anglican clergy felt still bound by their previous oaths of allegiance to James II. They would accept William and Mary as regents, but not as the rightful monarchs so could not swear an oath of allegiance to them. They became known as the nonjurors from the Latin meaning to &quot;swear an oath&quot;. The schism slowly declined throughout the 18th century.

===&quot;Jest is&quot;===

Some versions of the song give this as &quot;a pish on&quot; (&quot;a piss on&quot;).

===Passive obedience and non-resistance===

Passive obedience is the doctrine espoused by Bishop Berkeley in 1712 that people have &quot;a moral duty to observe the negative precepts (prohibitions) of the law, including the duty not to resist the execution of punishment&quot;. Although Berkeley made exceptions to this, the exceptions did not cover tyranny, and therefore would not have excuse revoking &quot;old principles&quot; and changing allegiance. Bray clearly thinks this is &quot;a joke&quot;.

The term nonresistance was used to refer to the Established Church during the religious troubles in England following the English Civil War and Protestant Succession. It is &quot;the practice or principle of not resisting authority, even when it is unjustly exercised&quot;. Bray wishes to be seen as embracing enthusiastically the new order regardless of previous oaths.

===Tory===

Queen Anne&#x27;s first government was Whig, but the Tories rose soon to negotiate the Treaty of Utrecht to end the Whig War of the Spanish Succession. During this period, several men of great force rose under the leadership of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, and Henry St. John, the Viscount Bolingbroke. This is notable, because the voices of this Tory administration (including Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift) were adept satirists, and the &quot;Vicar of Bray&quot; was composed, most likely, by a sympathetic wit.

The idea that the Church was in danger (lines 32–33) was a common rallying cry of the Tory churchmen from 1701 onward. The danger was from Puritans, for the most part. The Vicar&#x27;s previous beliefs were of reforming, then alien sorts. (Alien meaning Catholic: a religion controlled not by Englishmen and ruled by an English monarch, but by the foreign Pope, who himself might be under the control of foreign monarchs.) But now the Vicar worries that the Church is under threat, and he is alarmed, specifically, at the &#x27;lies&#x27; of those who are occasional conformists (&quot;i.e.&quot; persons whose obedience is partial and likely nominal, &quot;occasioned&quot; not by true belief but to avoid the civil disabilities of the Penal Laws).

===Pudding Time===

&quot;OED&quot; says: &quot;The time when pudding or puddings are to be had; (hence fig.) a time when a person is in luck; a favourable or useful time&quot;. The OED entry cites this song as an example of the phrase&#x27;s use.

===Whig===

George I&#x27;s first government was Whig. In particular, George I&#x27;s rule was the zenith of Robert Walpole, the first British Prime Minister. Walpole dominated British politics and polarised the populace. Whigs monopolised power during the Walpole administration.

The Whigs generally prevailed during the Hanoverian reigns, with some notable exceptions. During this period, the Whigs were known as standing for religious tolerance and state sponsorship of trade. The Tories were the party of the aristocracy and the squires (the country estate holders). Tories accused the Whigs of taking Holland, which had become very wealthy with mercantilism and tolerance, as their model. The emergent foreign trade interests were favoured by George I, who himself came from modern-day Germany and tried to distance himself as much as possible from religious matters. His background was in a state with little monarchical control of religion, and this meant that his court was disengaged. The Vicar therefore embraces the occasional conformity that he previously thought a danger.

===Faith&#x27;s great Defender===

The Latin title was first granted by the Pope to King Henry VIII, who subsequently split the English Church from Rome; hence the double irony of the song applying it to Protestant King George. The line is even more ironic, since George I did not take stands on religious matters, preferring to practice salutary neglect of church matters. In fact, George II (king at the time of this song&#x27;s setting) reduced the involvement of the Crown with the Church in general and diminished the role of Lords in church affairs. Thus, he seemed to contemporaries to be a more &quot;secular&quot; king than they had had before, and certainly not a &quot;&quot;.

===Hannover===

This spelling is standard in German, but archaic in English; the modern English spelling is &quot;Hanover&quot;.

==Historical basis of the character==

The parish referred to in the song is Bray, Berkshire, which lies in close proximity to several sites of political and religious significance, including Hampton Court Palace and Windsor Castle.

Several individuals have been proposed as the model for the song. Simon Symonds was vicar of Bray in 1522–51, during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI. However the candidate favoured by church historian Thomas Fuller and dramatist Richard Brome was Simon Aleyn, vicar of Bray in 1557–65, during the reigns of Mary I and Elizabeth I. Although the song alludes to events of the 17th and 18th centuries, it could be that Bray had already developed a tradition of clerical &#x27;realpolitik&#x27; and religious pliability as defence against the turbulence of Tudor religious upheavals.

The candidate whose lifespan and career clearly correspond with the well-known lyrics is Francis Carswell, vicar of Bray for 42 years, 1667–1709, during the reigns of Charles II, James II, William III and Mary II and Anne. Carswell &quot;was of like easy conscience&quot; to his antecedents and remained vicar of Bray until his &quot;dying day&quot;, through most of the events described, except the accession of the first Hanoverian king George I alluded to in the final verse. It would not be surprising if, as the song grew in popularity, an additional verse was appended to make it relevant during the mid-18th-century and beyond.

Thomas Barlow has also been suggested as an inspiration for the song, but this may just be because he had a prominent clerical and academic career spanning the vicissitudes alluded to. His career did not extend into the reigns of Queen Anne or George I as implied by the lyrics.

<text>David Ross Locke (also known by his pseudonym Petroleum V. Nasby) (September 20, 1833February 15, 1888) was an American journalist and early political commentator during and after the American Civil War.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Locke was born in Vestal, Broome County, New York, the son of Nathaniel Reed Locke and Hester Locke.

===Career===
He was apprenticed at age 12 to the &quot;Democrat&quot; in Cortland County, New York. Following a seven-year apprenticeship, he &quot;tramped around&quot; (meaning he was an itinerant printer) until a protracted stay with the &quot;Pittsburgh Chronicle&quot;. Around 1855, Locke started, with others, the Plymouth (Ohio) &quot;Herald.&quot; 
On March 20, 1856, he became the editor of the &quot;Bucyrus Journal&quot;. By 1861, he had purchased and was the editor of &quot;The Jeffersonian&quot; in Findlay, Ohio, where he began writing his Nasby letters. From October 15, 1865, he edited and wrote for the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; in Toledo, Ohio, which he purchased in 1867.

==Nasby Letters==
Locke&#x27;s most famous works, the &quot;Nasby Letters&quot;, were written in the character of, and over the signature of, &quot;Rev. Petroleum V(esuvius) Nasby&quot;, a Copperhead and Democrat. They have been described as &quot;the Civil War written in sulphuric acid&quot;.

Locke&#x27;s fictional alter ego, Nasby, loudly champions the cause of the Confederate States of America from Secession onward, but does little to actively help it. After being conscripted into the Union Army he deserts to the Confederates, joining the fictional &quot;Pelican Brigade&quot;. However, he finds life in the Confederate Army &quot;tite nippin&quot; and soon deserts again. By the end of the Civil War, he is back in civilian life.

The Nasby Letters, although written in the semi-literate spelling used by other humorists of the time, were a sophisticated work of ironic fiction. They were consciously intended to rally support for the Union cause; &quot;Nasby&quot; himself was portrayed as a thoroughly detestable character – a supreme opportunist, bigoted, work-shy, often half-drunk, and willing to say or do anything to get a Postmaster&#x27;s job. (Locke&#x27;s own father had served as Postmaster of Virgil, New York.) 
At the time the Letters were written, postmaster positions were political plums, offering a guaranteed federal salary for relatively undemanding work. Until the glorious day when he received a &quot;Post Orfis&quot; from Andrew Johnson, Nasby worked, when he worked, most frequently as a preacher. His favorite biblical texts, unsurprisingly, were the ones that were used by Southern ministers to &quot;prove&quot; that slavery was ordained by the Bible.

Abraham Lincoln loved the Nasby Letters, quoting them frequently. Lincoln is reported to have said, &quot;I intend to tell him if he will communicate his talent to me, I will swap places with him!&quot;

After the Civil War, Nasby wrote about Reconstruction. He settled in several different places, most notably &quot;Confedrit X Roads, is in the Stait of Kentucky&quot;, a fictional town full of idle, whiskey-loving, scrounging ex-Confederates, and a few hard-working, decent folk, who by an amazing coincidence were all strong Republicans. He traveled frequently, sometimes not entirely voluntarily (Nasby&#x27;s habit of borrowing money he never repaid, and running up tabs at the local saloon often made him unpopular) and continued to comment on the issues of the day.

Locke discontinued the Nasby Letters a few years before his death, since the times had changed and Nasby was no longer topical. While the semi-literate spelling in which they are written has often discouraged modern readers, it can also be seen as a point of characterizing &quot;Nasby&quot;.

Several collections of the Letters came out in book form, some illustrated by Thomas Nast, who was a friend and political ally of Locke.

==Death==
Locke died on February 15, 1888, in Toledo.

<text>Samuel Locke (November 23, 1732 – January 15, 1778) was an American Congregational clergyman and educator.

==Biography==
Samuel Locke was born in Woburn, Massachusetts on November 23, 1732. He was the son of Samuel Locke and Rebecca (Richardson) Locke Wilder.

He graduated from Harvard College in 1755, where he was a classmate of future American President and founding father John Adams. He was ordained at Sherburne 7 Nov 1759.

He married Mary Porter on 2 January 1760. Mary was the daughter of Rev. Samuel Porter. Rev. Porter was a predecessor to Rev Locke at Sherburne. They had 3 children (2 sons and a daughter): Dr. Samuel Locke (1761-1788), Mary Locke (1763-1796), and John Locke (1765-1800).

After serving as pastor in Sherborn, Massachusetts, he was appointed president of Harvard University. He held that post from 1770 to 1773, when he resigned after his housemaid became pregnant. He then returned to Sherborn, where he died of apoplexy.

<text>Belva Ann Bennett Lockwood (October 24, 1830 – May 19, 1917) was an American lawyer, politician, educator, and author who was active in the women&#x27;s rights and women&#x27;s suffrage movements. She was one of the first women lawyers in the United States, and in 1879 she became the first woman to be admitted to practice law before the U.S. Supreme Court. Lockwood ran for president in 1884 and 1888 on the ticket of the National Equal Rights Party and was the first woman to appear on official ballots. While Victoria Woodhull is commonly cited as the first woman to run for president, Lockwood was the first one to appear on any ballots, due to Woodhull being too young for the presidency when she ran.

Lockwood overcame many social and personal obstacles related to gender restrictions. Earlier in her life, Lockwood was a teacher and school principal, working to equalize pay for women in education. She supported the movement for world peace, and was a proponent of the temperance movement.

==Early and Personal Life==

Belva Ann Bennett was born in Royalton, New York, daughter of Lewis Johnson Bennett, a farmer, and his wife Hannah Green. Her aunt&#x27;s house where she spent some of her childhood still stands at 5070 Griswold Street. In front of this house is a memorial to her with a plaque that gives a brief biography of her life. By 14, she was teaching at the local elementary school. In 1848, when she was 18, she married Uriah McNall, a local farmer.

McNall died of tuberculosis in 1853, three years after their daughter Lura was born. 

== Education ==
Lockwood realized she needed a better education to support herself and her daughter. She attended Genesee Wesleyan Seminary to prepare for study at college. Her plan, as she explained to &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, was not well received by many of her friends and colleagues; most women did not seek higher education, and it was especially unusual for a widow to do so. She persuaded the administration at Genesee College to admit her.

It was during her studies at Genesee College that Lockwood first became attracted to the law, although the school had no law department. Since a local law professor was offering private classes, she became one of his students. It made her want to learn more.

==Early career==
Lockwood graduated with honors in 1857 and soon became the headmistress of Lockport Union School. It was a responsible position, but Lockwood found that whether she was teaching or working as an administrator, she was paid half of what her male counterparts were making. 

For the next few years, Lockwood continued to teach and also work as the principal at several local schools for young women. She stayed at Lockport until 1861, then became principal of the Gainesville Female Seminary. In 1863, Belva bought The Owego Female Seminary, where she was Principal before leaving to pursue her political career. This building was dismantled and moved, before being renovated in 2019 as the Belva Lockwood Inn in Owego, NY. Lockwood&#x27;s educational philosophy was gradually changing, particularly after she met women&#x27;s rights activist Susan B. Anthony. Lockwood agreed with many of Anthony&#x27;s ideas about society&#x27;s restrictions on women. Anthony was concerned about the limited education girls received. Courses at most girls&#x27; schools chiefly prepared female students for domestic life and possibly for temporary work as teachers. Anthony spoke about how young women ought to be given more options, including preparation for careers in the business world, where the pay was better. Lockwood was encouraged to make changes at her schools. She expanded the curriculum and added courses typical of those which young men took, such as public speaking, botany, and gymnastics.

Lockwood gradually determined to study law rather than continue teaching, and to leave upstate New York. 

In February 1866, Belva and her daughter Lura moved to Washington, D.C., as Belva believed it was the center of power in the United States and would provide good opportunities to advance in the legal profession. She opened a coeducational private school while exploring the study of law. In the mid-1860s, coeducation was unusual; most schools were separated by gender.

== Second marriage ==
In 1868, Belva remarried, this time to a man much older than she. Reverend Ezekiel Lockwood, an American Civil War veteran, was a Baptist minister and practicing dentist. They had a daughter Jessie (who died before her second birthday). Lockwood supported his wife&#x27;s desire for legal study as well as encouraged her to pursue subjects that interested her. She earned a Master of Arts from Syracuse University in 1871. Not only did Rev. Lockwood have progressive ideas about women&#x27;s roles in society, he helped raise Belva&#x27;s daughter Lura, from her first marriage. Ezekiel Lockwood died in late April 1877. In July 1879 Lockwood&#x27;s daughter Lura McNall married DeForest Orme, a pharmacist.

== Legal education ==
According to Lockwood&#x27;s later account to the &quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot; about 1870 she applied to the Columbian Law School in the District of Columbia. The trustees refused to admit her, fearing she would distract the male students. She and several other women were finally admitted to the new National University School of Law (now the George Washington University Law School). Although she completed her coursework in May 1873, the law school refused to grant her a diploma because of her gender.

Without a diploma, Lockwood could not gain admittance to the District of Columbia Bar. After a year, she wrote a letter to the President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant, appealing to him as president &quot;ex officio&quot; of the National University Law School. She asked him for justice, stating she had passed all her courses and deserved to be awarded a diploma. In September 1873, within a week of having sent the letter, Lockwood received her Bachelor of Laws. She was 43 years old.

== Law practice ==
The District of Columbia Bar admitted her, although several judges told Lockwood they had no confidence in her, a reaction she repeatedly had to overcome. When she tried to gain admission to the Maryland Bar, a judge lectured her and told her that God Himself had determined that women were not equal to men and never could be. When she tried to respond on her own behalf, he said she had no right to speak and had her removed from the courtroom. She also applied to the Court of Claims to represent veterans and their families, but was denied. She applied to the United States Supreme Court bar after having practiced for the minimum three years and secured Albert G. Riddle as sponsor, but her motion was also denied on gender grounds.

Lockwood thus struggled against both social practice and the limited legal standing accorded women. Under English Common Law, Lockwood was considered a &quot;feme covert&quot; (English version of medieval Anglo-Norman legal term), that is, a married woman. Her status under the law differed from that of an unmarried woman, as a wife was considered strictly subordinate to her husband. Even in 1873, many states refused to allow a married woman to individually own or inherit property, nor did she have the right to make contracts or keep money earned unless her husband gave his permission.

Nonetheless, Lockwood began to build a practice and won some cases. Even her detractors acknowledged her competence. She became known as an advocate for women&#x27;s issues; she spoke on behalf of an 1872 bill for equal pay for federal government employees. Lockwood also remained active in several women&#x27;s suffrage organizations, and testified before Congress in support of legislation to give married women and widows more legal protection.
Because her practice was limited in the 1870s due to social discrimination, Lockwood drafted an anti-discrimination bill to have the same access to the bar as male colleagues. From 1874 to 1879, she lobbied Congress to pass it. In 1879, Congress finally passed the law, which President Rutherford B. Hayes signed into law. It allowed all qualified women attorneys to practice in any federal court. Lockwood was then sworn in as the first woman member of the U.S. Supreme Court bar on March 3, 1879.

Late in 1880, Lockwood became the first female lawyer to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing &quot;Kaiser v. Stickney.&quot; In 1906, Lockwood represented the Cherokee Nation in &quot;United States v. Cherokee Nation&quot;. She was successful in ensuring the payment of the five million dollar suit, one of the largest made to that date to a Native American tribe for land ceded to the government. She also represented hundreds of family members of Civil War veterans in their pension claims. Lockwood later sponsored Samuel R. Lowery to the Supreme Court bar, making him the fifth black attorney to be admitted, and ultimately the first to argue a case before the court.

Lockwood had a 43-year career as a lawyer.

==Campaign for President==
Belva Lockwood was the first woman (or second, depending on one&#x27;s opinion, after Victoria Woodhull) to run for President of the United States. Lockwood ran as the candidate of the National Equal Rights Party. She ran in the presidential elections of 1884 and 1888. Her running mate was Marietta Stow in 1884. In 1888 she originally ran with Alfred H. Love, except when he was nominated he wasn&#x27;t informed of it. When he found out, as the president of the Universal Peace Union and a lifelong world peace activist, he was horrified to run as vice president to the commander in chief, and dropped out of the race. Lockwood was in a scramble with no vice president, so, in the end, she chose Charles Stuart Weld, son of progressives Theodore Dwight Weld and Angelina Grimké.

Representing a third party without a broad base of support, Lockwood did not have a serious chance of winning the presidency. A letter she sent to Linda Slaughter provided some insights into her campaign. She wrote: &quot;I intend if possible to get up an Electoral ticket for each State; and thus get up a grand agitation on the woman question, but am not so anxious about the number of votes polled&quot;. &quot;Notable American Women&quot; stated she received about 4,100 votes. Since women could not vote, and most newspapers were opposed to her candidacy, it was unusual that she received any votes. In an 1884 article, the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; referred to her as &quot;old lady Lockwood&quot; and warned male readers of the dangers of &quot;petticoat rule&quot;.

On January 12, 1885, Lockwood petitioned the United States Congress to have her votes counted. She told newspapers and magazines that she had evidence of voter fraud. She asserted that supporters had seen their ballots ripped up and that she had &quot;received one-half the electoral vote of Oregon, and a large vote in Pennsylvania, but the votes in the latter state were not counted, simply dumped into the waste basket as false votes&quot;.

==Later years==
Lockwood was a well-respected writer, who frequently wrote essays about women&#x27;s suffrage and the need for legal equality for women. Among the publications in which she appeared in the 1880s and 1890s were &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; (then a journal of current issues), the &quot;American Magazine of Civics&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s&quot;. In addition to being active in the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the Equal Rights Party, Lockwood served as president of the Woman&#x27;s National Press Association. The organization for women journalists also advocated for equal rights for women. Her other feminist activities included being appointed Attorney General of the American Woman&#x27;s Republic, an organization founded by Marietta Stowe and dedicated to preparing women for the rights and responsibilities of full citizenship. 

Lockwood believed strongly in working for world peace. She co-edited a journal called &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;, and acted as an executive board member of the Universal Peace Union; she was one of its representatives at an exposition held in Paris in 1889. She wrote tracts on international arbitration and was one of the nominating members of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. She was also a delegate to an International Peace Congress in London in 1890. She continued to speak on behalf of peace and disarmament to the year of her death. She was likely disappointed as the United States prepared to enter the war in Europe.

Belva Lockwood died on May 19, 1917, and was buried in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==Legacy==

Syracuse University awarded Lockwood an honorary Doctor of Laws in 1908.

The communities of Belva, West Virginia; Lockwood, Monterey County, California; Lockwood, West Virginia; and the hamlet of Lockwood, New York, were named in her honor. As Lockwood gained renown, mothers named their daughters after her.

At least three figureheads were carved in her likeness: for the ships &quot;Martha&quot;, &quot;Julia Lawrence&quot;, and an unnamed ship that has a full-length masthead. One of the figureheads is displayed in the museum at Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Connecticut. &quot;With raised chin she gazes straight ahead as if her attention were fixed on the distant horizon&quot;.

During World War II, a merchant marine ship, the Liberty Ship USS &quot;Belva Lockwood&quot;, was named after her.

The National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., has a portrait of Lockwood by Nellie Mathes Horne. It was painted in 1908, when she received an honorary doctorate in law from Syracuse University.

In 1983, Lockwood was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. The statement about her noted: 

Using her knowledge of the law, she worked to secure woman suffrage, property law reforms, equal pay for equal work, and world peace. Thriving on publicity and partisanship and encouraging other women to pursue legal careers, Lockwood helped to open the legal profession to women.

In 1986, she was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 17¢ Great Americans series postage stamp.

In 2016, she was honored by the Green Bag with a bobblehead doll.

<text>Jacques Loeb (; ; April 7, 1859 – February 11, 1924) was a German-born American physiologist and biologist.

==Biography==

Jacques (born Itzak) Loeb, firstborn son of a Jewish family from the German Eifel region, was educated at the universities of Berlin, Munich, and Strasburg (M.D. 1884). He took postgraduate courses at the universities of Strasburg and Berlin, and in 1886 became assistant at the physiological institute of the University of Würzburg, remaining there until 1888. In a similar capacity, he then went to Strasburg University. During his vacations he pursued biological research, at Kiel in 1888, and at Naples in 1889 and 1890.

Jacques Loeb first arrived in the United States in 1891 when he accepted a position at Bryn Mawr College, however, they provided insufficient facilities for his work which would later influence his resignation. In 1892, he was called to the University of Chicago as assistant professor of physiology and experimental biology, while later becoming associate professor in 1895, and professor of physiology in 1899. John B. Watson (the &quot;father of Behaviorism&quot;) attended Loeb&#x27;s neurology classes at the University of Chicago. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1899. In 1902, he was called to fill a similar chair at the University of California. Writer John Fleming Wilson (1877-1922) called Carmel Point &quot;Point Loeb&quot; after Professor Loeb, one of the many professors who had summer homes on Professors&#x27; Row on the edge of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.

In 1910, Loeb moved to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York, where he headed a department created for him. He remained at Rockefeller (now Rockefeller University) until his death. Throughout his career, Loeb spent some summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, performing experiments on various marine invertebrates. While there, Jacques Loeb performed his most famous experiment, on artificial parthenogenesis. With this experiment, Loeb was able to cause the sea urchins&#x27; eggs to begin embryonic development without sperm. The slight chemical modifications of the water in which the eggs were kept, served as the stimulus for the development to begin. Later in 1918, Loeb established and became the first Editor of the &quot;Journal of General Physiology.&quot;

Jacques Loeb became one of the most famous scientists in America, widely covered in newspapers and magazines, influencing other important individuals in the scientific world such as B.F. Skinner. He was the model for the character of Max Gottlieb in Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s Pulitzer-winning novel &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;, the first great work of fiction to idealize and idolize pure science. Mark Twain also wrote an essay titled &quot;Dr. Loeb&#x27;s Incredible Discovery&quot;, urging the reader not to support a rigid general consensus, but to instead be open to new scientific advances.

Loeb was nominated many times for the Nobel Prize but never won.

Dr. Loeb was an atheist. He died of coronary artery disease while vacationing in Bermuda in 1924. 

==Research area==
The main subjects of Loeb&#x27;s work were:

* Animal tropisms and their relation to the instincts of animals
* Heteromorphosis, the replacement of an injured or removed organ by a different organ
* Toxic and antitoxic effects of ions
* Artificial parthenogenesis
* Hybridization of the eggs of sea-urchins by the sperm of starfish

<text>William Loeb III (December 26, 1905 – September 13, 1981) was an American newspaper publisher. He is remembered for his unyieldingly conservative political views, which helped made the &quot;Manchester Union Leader&quot; of Manchester, New Hampshire, one of the best-known small papers in the country. The newspaper also benefited from nationwide attention every four years during the New Hampshire presidential primary. Loeb was publisher of the &quot;Union Leader&quot; from 1946 until his death, a period of 35 years.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Loeb was born on December 26, 1905, in Washington, D.C., the son of Catharine/Katherine Wilhelmina (Dorr) and William Loeb Jr. (1866–1937). His parents were both of German descent. His father was executive secretary to Theodore Roosevelt, and a nationally known figure in his own day. Loeb&#x27;s paternal grandfather, also named William Loeb, was a German immigrant. Loeb&#x27;s siblings were Louisa Loeb-Neudorf, Amelia Olive Loeb and Lillian May Loeb.

The younger Loeb attended the Hotchkiss School and Williams College, and soon met and married Elizabeth Nagy, a faculty member at nearby Smith College. They were married on May 29, 1926. Nagy was eight years older than Loeb, and his parents objected to the matrimony. Loeb&#x27;s father excluded him from his will in light of the marriage. The couple divorced six years later on October 11, 1932, and Loeb received alimony from Nagy for several years. Later in his life, Loeb made efforts to hide the marriage, and records of the divorce (Loeb v. Loeb F-3144) were found missing at the time they were to be archived on microfiche.

===1941–1948===
Loeb partnered with his friend Charlie Weaver to buy the &quot;St. Albans Messenger&quot; in St. Albans, Vermont, in 1941 to enter the publishing arena. Loeb also received cash investments from a woman named Marka Loening, who indulged in an extramarital affair with Loeb while waiting for her divorce from her estranged husband to be finalized. Loeb later used funding from Loening to buy the &quot;Burlington Daily News&quot; in 1942. One of Loeb&#x27;s first infamous journalistic exploits was the publishing of his own baptismal certificate on the front page of both Vermont papers in an attempt to disprove rumors of his Jewish ancestry.

Loeb cited ulcers for his medical exemption from service during World War II, allegedly drinking large quantities of alcohol before doctor&#x27;s visits to ensure flare-ups.

In 1946, Loeb secured funding from Ridder Publications to buy the &quot;Manchester Union&quot; and the &quot;Evening Leader&quot; from Annie Reid Knox, the widow of former Navy Secretary William Franklin Knox. Mrs. Knox later regretted the sale, claiming she had not seen how Loeb handled his Vermont newspapers, and claiming that Loeb did not mention the involvement of the Ridder family. Loeb used $250,000 in funding from his mother&#x27;s accounts to fund the purchase of his share in the papers, and in 1948 used an additional $300,000 to buy out other shareholders and gain complete control of the papers, which he then merged into the &quot;Union Leader&quot;.

In 1947, Loeb brought in investor Leonard Finder as a business partner in the paper. Marka Loening, increasingly resentful of the presence of Scripps-Howard heiress Elizabeth &quot;Nackey&quot; Scripps-Gallowhur in the newspaper offices, withdrew her interests in Loeb&#x27;s papers that same year. Loeb&#x27;s mother had been under the impression that he and Loening were to be married, but discovered upon Loening&#x27;s departure that Loeb had been secretly married to Vermont resident Eleanore McAllister since 1942. Afterwards, Loeb publicly disclosed the marriage in his papers, but claimed it had taken place in 1947 and not 1942.

Meanwhile, new competition emerged in Manchester with the return of Bernard J. &quot;B.J.&quot; McQuaid, a former &quot;Manchester Union&quot; reporter under the tenure of Colonel Knox, from military service in Europe. McQuaid founded a rival paper, &quot;The New Hampshire Sunday News&quot;, with his brother, Elias. Loeb quickly wooed Bernard McQuaid over to the &quot;Union Leader&quot;, and bought the &quot;Sunday News&quot; outright in 1948. With no other statewide media (radio signals being blocked by mountains, and other papers only local to their towns), Loeb essentially gained a media monopoly in the state for himself. He tried, but failed, to win the license for the only television station licensed in the state, WMUR-TV.

Loeb&#x27;s then-wife, Eleanore McAllister, gave birth to a daughter, Katharine Penelope, on October 29, 1948.

===1949–1952===
In 1949, Loeb used the additional $300,000 from his mother and cash from various state politicians he endorsed to buy out Leonard Finder. Also in 1949, Loeb founded the &quot;Vermont Sunday News&quot;, largely a copy of the New Hampshire edition&#x27;s content.

On August 5, 1949, Loeb took Nackey Gallowhur to meet his mother in New York City. There, George Gallowhur, Nackey&#x27;s husband, attempted to serve her divorce papers. Loeb refused to permit Gallowhur&#x27;s agents from serving her, and he was jailed briefly for interfering. Gallowhur sued Loeb for alienation of affection in accordance with an old Vermont law. Mrs. Loeb, infuriated at her son&#x27;s mistreatment of Eleanore McAllister, excluded him from her will and sued him for the $1 million dollars in funding he had obtained from her to finance his acquisitions of the &quot;Union Leader&quot; in 1946 and 1949.

Also in 1949, Loeb became the third president of American China Policy Association (ACPA), an anti-communist organization that supported the government of Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek.

Loeb continued to see Nackey. In 1949, he fired the print staff at his Vermont newspapers when they attempted to unionize. Nackey was initially placed in charge of printing, but the couple left Vermont in 1952 in the wake of his mother&#x27;s lawsuit.

===1952–1966===
Loeb and Nackey Gallowhur moved to Reno, Nevada, where Loeb sued for divorce from Eleanore McAllister and then married Nackey. The Vermont papers flailed in the absence of Loeb&#x27;s attention, and also suffered from negative reader and advertiser reaction to his opinionated absentee editorials. The &quot;Daily News&quot; ceased operations in 1959. Loeb did not visit the St. Albans paper offices again until 1973.

In 1950, Loeb repeated his baptismal certificate stunt, this time on the &quot;Union Leader&quot; front page. He again hoped to dispel gossip about his Jewish heritage, this time in the wake of controversy surrounding his political endorsements.

Loeb moved to Prides Crossing outside Beverly, Massachusetts, in 1955 to be closer to his New England newspaper operations. The Loeb&#x27;s had one daughter, Edith Roosevelt, born in 1956.

In 1957, Loeb attempted to launch a paper in nearby Haverhill, the &quot;Haverhill Journal&quot;, but the publication proved to be a drain on the staff and presses shared with his other newspapers. The &quot;Journal&quot; folded in 1965, and Loeb blamed union activity for the closure. During a newspaper strike in Boston, he imported copies of the &quot;Union Leader&quot; into the city, but stopped after incorrect sports information in the publication led to threats from figures in the city&#x27;s crime world. Loeb purchased the rights to the &quot;Connecticut Sunday Herald&quot; name (but not its presses), and relaunched it from Bridgeport, Connecticut, but once again his editorial stances alienated readers, and the paper closed.

Loeb&#x27;s mother, Katherine Dorr-Loeb, died on November 24, 1966. Her will acknowledged Loeb&#x27;s siblings, ex-wife Eleanore McAllister, and his daughter Katharine Penelope, but left him nothing. He filed suit, beginning a five-year legal battle that lasted through 1973 and rose to the Vermont Supreme Court, claiming that he had reconciled with his mother and that she had promised him 75 percent of her estate. He settled for less than 10 percent, after her estate had been drained of the bulk of its funds through his legal maneuvering. Loeb separated himself from his ex-wife and Katharine Penelope. When his daughter suffered a near-fatal injury in an equestrian accident the next year and lost a kidney, Loeb refused to speak to her.

===1970s===
In early 1972, Loeb attacked Edmund Muskie through the &quot;Union Leader&quot;, derailing the Maine senator&#x27;s 1972 presidential bid. A letter to the editor, known as the Canuck letter, was published by the newspaper. Believed to be an act of political sabotage originating from within the Committee for the Re-Election of the President, the letter implied that Muskie was prejudiced against French-Canadians. Loeb also published an editorial previously issued by &quot;Newsweek&quot; that portrayed Muskie&#x27;s wife, Jane, in an unfavorable light. Muskie&#x27;s subsequent emotional defense of himself and his wife in front of the newspaper&#x27;s offices in Manchester was seen as a sign of weakness and instability. Muskie later claimed that there were not tears in his eyes, as many papers reported, but rather melting snow, as it had been snowing during his speech. Regardless, the event had a negative impact on his campaign—in the view of reporter David S. Broder, &quot;Muskie never recovered from that Saturday in the snow.&quot;

Loeb&#x27;s journalism résumé was the subject of skepticism in 1974, when he claimed in a front-page editorial to have worked for the Hearst conglomerate, as a reporter for the &quot;New York World&quot; for eight years before buying his St. Albans paper. The Hearst Corporation denied he had ever been employed there, and the &quot;World&quot; had actually ceased operations eight years before Loeb said he had started work there. &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; chairman Paul Block Jr. also denied ever seeing Loeb on the assignments he claimed to have worked.

Author Kevin Cash published a biography of Loeb entitled &quot;Who the Hell IS William Loeb?&quot; in 1975. Loeb&#x27;s legal threats forced Cash to create his own publishing company, incorporated in Delaware, out of Loeb&#x27;s reach. After four New Hampshire publishers balked at printing it, Cash had the book printed in Vermont. Loeb also gained infamy in the 1970s for attacking then-governor Walter R. Peterson Jr.&#x27;s teenage daughter for allegedly advocating the use of marijuana. She suffered an emotional breakdown as a result of the stress and public scrutiny thrust upon her in the wake of the allegations. Loeb was instrumental in the victory of Meldrim Thomson Jr., in the next gubernatorial election, and remained a political ally of Thomson&#x27;s until Loeb&#x27;s death.

In December 1977, Loeb was driving with his wife outside of Reno, Nevada, when the card skidded of the road due to ice and flipped over; Nackey Loeb suffered spinal damage and was paralyzed from the waist down.

Loeb died of cancer in September 1981 at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Massachusetts. He left control of the &quot;Union Leader&quot; to his wife. She remained as publisher until stepping down in May 1999; she died in January 2000. Control of the newspaper then fell to Bernard McQuaid&#x27;s son, Joseph McQuaid.

==Legacy==
Loeb is best remembered for his unyielding conservatism. The &quot;Union Leader&quot; already tilted Republican editorially when he bought it, but veered sharply to the right after his purchase. Regardless, Loeb did not hesitate to castigate fellow Republicans, once writing: &quot;This newspaper now solemnly charges that President Eisenhower has done more to destroy the respect, honor and power of the United States than any President in its history.&quot; Loeb also stood alone among conservatives in his staunch support for Jimmy Hoffa, despite otherwise being a foe of labor.

In New Hampshire, Loeb&#x27;s major political legacy is an anti-tax pledge (&quot;The Pledge&quot;) that has been taken not only by all Republicans seeking the gubernatorial nomination, but also by all Democrats who have successfully been elected.

On May 1, 2022, Loeb&#x27;s stepdaughter—Nackey E. Gallowhur-Scagliotti, daughter of Nackey and George Gallowhur—accused him of sexually molesting her when she was 7 years old. The &quot;Union Leader&quot; denounced Loeb and removed his name from their masthead in response to the accusations.

<doc id="755231" wikidata="Q1703991" url="?curid=755231" title="Mo' Better Blues">
<text>Mo&#x27; Better Blues is a 1990 American musical comedy-drama film starring Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes, and Spike Lee, who also wrote, produced, and directed. It follows a period in the life of fictional jazz trumpeter Bleek Gilliam (played by Washington) as a series of bad decisions result in his jeopardizing both his relationships and his playing career. The film focuses on themes of friendship, loyalty, honesty, cause-and-effect, and ultimately salvation. It features the music of the Branford Marsalis quartet and Terence Blanchard on trumpet. The film was released five months after the death of Robin Harris and is dedicated to his memory, being his final acting role. The film marked the first collaboration for Lee and Washington.

==Plot==
In Brooklyn, New York in 1969, a group of four boys walk up to Bleek Gilliam&#x27;s Brownstone apartment and ask him to play baseball with them. Bleek&#x27;s mother insists that he continue his trumpet lesson. His father becomes concerned that Bleek will grow up to be a sissy, and a family argument ensues. Bleek continues playing his trumpet, and his friends depart.

Over twenty years later, an adult Bleek performs on the trumpet at a busy nightclub with his successful jazz band, The Bleek Quintet. Giant, childhood friend and the band&#x27;s manager, advises Bleek to stop allowing his saxophone player Shadow Henderson to grandstand with long solos.

The next morning Bleek wakes up with his girlfriend, Indigo Downes. She leaves to go to class, while he meets his father for a game of catch, telling him that while he likes Indigo, he likes other women too and is not ready to make a commitment. Later in the day while he is practicing, another woman named Clarke Bentancourt visits him. She suggests that he fire Giant as manager; he suggests that they make love (which he refers to as &quot;mo&#x27; better&quot;). He becomes upset when she bites his lip, saying, &quot;I make my living with my lips.&quot;

Giant meets with his bookie to place bets. He meets Bleek at the club with the rest of the band, except for the pianist, Left Hand Lacey, who arrives late with his French girlfriend and is scolded by Giant. Later Giant goes to the club owners’ office, points out how busy the club has been since Bleek and his band began playing there, and unsuccessfully attempts to renegotiate their contract.

Giant meets his bookie the next morning, who is concerned that Giant is going too deep into debt. Giant shrugs it off, and places several new bets. He then stops at Shadow&#x27;s home to drop off a record. Shadow confides in him that he is cheating on his girlfriend. This leads to the next scene where Bleek is in bed with Clarke, and she asks him to let her sing a number at the club with his band. He declines her request.

Bleek and Giant fend off requests from the other band members for a raise due to the band&#x27;s success. Bleek goes to the club owners to ask for more money, which they refuse, reminding him that Giant locked him into the current deal.

That night, both Clarke and Indigo arrive at the club to see Bleek. They are wearing the same style dress, which Bleek had purchased for them both. Bleek attempts to work it out with each girl, but they are both upset with him, and though he sleeps with them each again, they leave him (after he calls each of them by the other&#x27;s name). However, tension rises with Shadow who has feelings for Clarke.

During a bike ride together, Bleek insists that Giant should try to do a better job managing the band. Giant promises to do so, and then asks Bleek for a loan to pay his gambling debts. Bleek declines, and later Giant is apprehended by two loan sharks who demand payment. Giant can&#x27;t pay and gets his fingers broken. Later Giant tells Bleek that he injured himself during a cookout, but Bleek doesn&#x27;t believe him. Giant asks the other band members for money, and Left loans him five hundred dollars. When loan sharks stake out Giant&#x27;s home, he goes to Bleek for a place to stay who agrees to help him raise the money but fires him as manager.

Bleek misses both his girlfriends and leaves messages for each, but Clarke has begun a new relationship with Shadow. Bleek finds out about it and fires Shadow. The loan sharks find Giant at the club, take him outside, and beat him while Bleek plays, but before Bleek can raise the money. Bleek goes outside to intervene and gets beaten as well with one loan shark taking Bleek&#x27;s own trumpet and smacking him across the face with it, permanently injuring his lip and making him unable to continue playing the trumpet.

Over a year later following his recovery and slump, Bleek reunites with Giant, who has become a doorman and stopped gambling. He drops in to see Shadow and Clarke, who got out of the former club&#x27;s contract and are now performing together with the rest of Bleek&#x27;s former band. Shadow invites him on stage, and they play together. Still with scars on his lips and unable to play well, Bleek walks off the stage, gives his trumpet to a supportive Giant, and goes directly to Indigo&#x27;s house. Angry with him because he hasn&#x27;t contacted her in over a year, she tries to reject him but agrees to take him back when he begs her to save his life.

A montage flashes through their wedding, the birth of their son Miles, and their happy family with Bleek teaching his son to play the trumpet. In the final scene, a ten-year-old Miles wants to go outside to play with his friends. Indigo wants him to finish his trumpet lessons. However, unlike in the opening scene, Bleek relents and allows his son to play with friends.

== Production ==
Spike Lee wrote the film while working on &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989). It took him fifteen days to complete the first draft. The nickname &quot;Bleek&quot; for the protagonist was derived from Lee&#x27;s father, Bill Lee, who composed the film&#x27;s music score. Initially contemplating the use of real musicians, Lee opted mostly for actors, with Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts being an exception, playing drums in the actual Branford Marsalis Quartet. Giancarlo Esposito, who portrayed &quot;Left Hand Lacey,&quot; was a real-life pianist. Branford Marsalis, making a cameo, was originally cast as saxophonist &quot;Shadow Henderson,&quot; but Lee chose a professional actor, Wesley Snipes, for the role. Both Denzel Washington and Snipes underwent musical training with Marsalis and trumpeter Terence Blanchard to authentically handle their instruments in musical scenes. Lee also intentionally excluded drugs from the film to challenge stereotypical views of jazz musicians. The film&#x27;s original title, &quot;Love Supreme&quot;, inspired by saxophonist John Coltrane&#x27;s 1965 album &quot;A Love Supreme,&quot; was changed after his widow, Alice Coltrane, withdrew permission because of the film&#x27;s explicit content. The title was temporarily changed to &quot;Variations on the Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot; until at least May 1990, when it was ultimately shortened. Principal photography spanned from September 25, 1989, to December 1, 1989, with a total cost of $10 million. Actor-comedian Robin Harris, who played Butterbean Jones in the film and previously worked with Lee on &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, died on March 18, 1990, almost six months before the film&#x27;s release.

==Music==

The soundtrack to the film was played by “The Branford Marsalis Quartet Featuring Terence Blanchard”; the title composition and most of the soundtrack were written and produced by Bill Lee. In 1991, the soundtrack album was nominated for a Soul Train Music Award for Best Jazz Album. Delfeayo Marsalis, Branford Marsalis&#x27;s younger brother, reportedly aided Bill Lee in producing most of the film’s recordings, although his name is not credited.

===Musicians===
*Branford Marsalis – Tenor Saxophone, Soprano Saxophone
*Kenny Kirkland – Piano
*Robert Hurst – Bass
*Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts – Drums
*Terence Blanchard – Trumpet

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics, as the film holds a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews. The consensus states: &quot;&quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot; is rich with vibrant hues and Denzel Washington&#x27;s impassioned performance, although its straightforward telling lacks the political punch fans expect from a Spike Lee joint.&quot;

===Controversies===
For his portrayal of Jewish nightclub owners Moe and Josh Flatbush, Lee drew the ire of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, and other such Jewish organizations. The ADL claimed that the characterizations of the nightclub owners &quot;dredge up an age-old and highly dangerous form of anti-Semitic stereotyping&quot;, and the ADL was &quot;disappointed that Spike Lee – whose success is largely due to his efforts to break down racial stereotypes and prejudice – has employed the same kind of tactics that he supposedly deplores.&quot;

Lee eventually responded in an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, alleging &quot;a double standard at work in the accusations of anti-Semitism&quot; given the long history of negative portrayals of African-Americans in film: &quot;Not every black person is a pimp, murderer, prostitute, convict, rapist or drug addict, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped Hollywood from writing these roles for African-Americans&quot;. Lee argues that even if the Flatbush brothers are stereotyped figures, their &quot;10 minutes of screen time&quot; is insignificant when compared to &quot;100 years of Hollywood cinema... [and] a slew of really racist, anti-Semitic filmmakers&quot;. According to Lee, his status as a successful African-American artist has led to hostility and unfair treatment: &quot;Don&#x27;t hold me to a higher moral standard than the rest of my filmmaking colleagues... Now that young black filmmakers have arisen in the film industry, all of a sudden stereotypes are a big issue... I think it&#x27;s reaching the point where &quot;I&#x27;m&quot; getting reviewed, not my films.&quot;

Lee refused to apologize for his portrayal of the Flatbush brothers: &quot;I stand behind all my work, including my characters, Moe and Josh Flatbush... if critics are telling me that to avoid charges of anti-Semitism, all Jewish characters I write have to be model citizens, and not one can be a villain, cheat or a crook, and that no Jewish people have ever exploited black artists in the history of the entertainment industry, that&#x27;s unrealistic and unfair.&quot;

Cynda Williams complained about the behavior of some of the actors on the set. &quot;Many of the men were method actors. A couple of them had spent time together on previous Spike films, and their characters in &quot;Mo’ Better Blues&quot; were kind of chauvinistic. So being method, they were kind of chauvinistic all the time on set,&quot; said Williams. &quot;Some actors feel they have to stay in character to help play their roles.” Spike Lee responded, “I didn’t know about any chauvinistic behavior…” 

==Trivia==
* Terence Blanchard ghosted the trumpet for Denzel Washington and Branford Marsalis on saxophone for Wesley Snipes.
* It is the first film to feature an actual live birth on camera.
* It is dedicated in memory of Robin Harris, who died of a heart attack on March 18, 1990, almost six months before the film&#x27;s release.
* The original title was &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; named after the famous composition by John Coltrane but his widow, Alice Coltrane, denied her permission because of the script&#x27;s profanity.
* The first scene of the movie was parodied by Ludacris in his music video for &quot;Diamond In The Back&quot;.
* A episode of &quot;Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space&quot;, titled &quot;Moai Better Blues&quot;, parodies this film&#x27;s title.
* Washington and Cynda Williams did not get along on the set, a fact which Lee addressed on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;.
* Lost Boyz parodied the film in their song &quot;Me and My Crazy World&quot;.
* Hip-hop artists The Roots sample parts of the film in their album &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;.

<text>Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen (; 6 April 1911 – 6 August 1979) was a German biochemist. In 1964 he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine together with Konrad Bloch for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism while he was director of the Max-Planck Institute for Cellular Chemistry in Munich.

==Biography==
Feodor Lynen was born in Munich on 6 April 1911. His parents were Wilhelm Lynen, who taught mechanical engineering, and Frieda née Prym, whose father was an industrialist. He started his studies at the chemistry department of Munich University in 1930 and graduated in March 1937 under Heinrich Wieland with the work: &quot;On the Toxic Substances in Amanita&quot;. Lynen remained in Germany throughout World War II. In 1942 he became a chemistry lecturer at the Munich University. In 1947 he became an assistant professor and in 1953 a professor of biochemistry. From 1954 onwards he was director of the Max-Planck Institute for Cellular Chemistry in Munich, a position which was created for him at the instigation of two senior scientists, Otto Warburg and Otto Hahn. In 1972, that institute was merged into the newly founded Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry in 1972. Also in 1972, Lynen was named President of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker (GDCh).

In 1964, he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine together with Konrad Bloch for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. These discoveries took many years to work out. The Nobel Committee felt that this was important because understanding the metabolism of sterols and fatty acids could reveal how cholesterol affects heart disease and stroke. His Nobel Lecture on 11 December 1964 was &#x27;The pathway from &quot;activated acetic acid&quot; to the terpenes and fatty acids&#x27;.

Working mostly separately, Lynen and Bloch both discovered the steps that created squalene and turned the squalene into cholesterol. Initially, Lynen found that acetate activated by coenzyme A was required to start the process. He discovered the chemical structure of acetyl-coenzyme A, which was required for a detailed understanding of the biochemical pathways. He also learned that biotin, or Vitamin B7, was required in the process.
On 14 May 1937, Lynen married Eva Wieland (1915–2002), daughter of his academic teacher. They had five children between 1938 and 1946. Feodor Lynen died in Munich, Germany, on 6 August 1979, six weeks after an operation for an aneurysm.

==Fellowship==
The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has a fellowship named in his honor.

<doc id="755245" wikidata="Q1264525" url="?curid=755245" title="Duke of Kendal">
<text>The titles of Earl of Kendal and Duke of Kendal have been created several times, generally for people with a connection to the English/British royal family. The title refers to Kendal, a town in Cumbria.

*The first creation was for John, 4th son of King Henry IV, who was created Earl of Kendal, Earl of Richmond and Duke of Bedford in 1414. The titles became extinct at his death.
*The second creation was for John Beaufort, 3rd Earl of Somerset, a grandson of John of Gaunt, who was created Earl of Kendal and Duke of Somerset in 1443. He died the following year, and the titles became extinct.
*The third creation was for Jean de Foix, vicomte de Castillon, who was created Earl of Kendal in 1446. He gave allegiance to the King of France in 1462, and is thereby presumed to have forfeited his English peerage. However, his descendants in France (and, later, in Spain) continued to use the title under the name &#x27;Candale&#x27; (or &#x27;Candal&#x27;).
*The next Kendal creation was for Prince Rupert of the Rhine, nephew of King Charles I and a Royalist commander in the Civil War, who is sometimes (perhaps erroneously) said to have been created Baron Kendal along with the other titles of Earl of Holdernesse and Duke of Cumberland in 1644. This Kendal title, if it ever existed, became extinct on his death without legitimate issue.
*The first use of Kendal as a ducal title was in 1666, when Charles Stuart, son of the Duke of York, was given the titles of Duke of Kendal, Earl of Wigmore and Baron Holdenby. He died the following year, and these titles became extinct.
*The next creation was for Prince George of Denmark, the husband of Princess (later Queen) Anne, who was created Duke of Cumberland, Earl of Kendal and Baron Wokingham in 1689. He died without surviving issue, and the titles became extinct.
*The next creation was for Ehrengard von der Schulenberg, Duchess of Munster, the mistress of King George I, who was created Duchess of Kendal, Countess of Feversham and Baroness Glastonbury in 1719. These titles were for life only and expired with their first holder.
*The last Kendal creation was for James Lowther, who was created Baron Kendal, Baron Burgh, Baron Lowther, Viscount Lowther, Viscount Lonsdale and Earl of Lonsdale in 1784. These titles became extinct at his death.
*In 1816, at the time of the marriage of Princess Charlotte of Wales (daughter of the Prince Regent) to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, it was announced that the groom was to be created Duke of Kendal. However, in the end this never happened.

<text>Philippe&#x27;s, or &quot;Philippe the Original&quot; ( ) is a restaurant located in downtown Los Angeles, California. The restaurant is well known for continuously operating since 1908, making it one of the oldest restaurants in Los Angeles. It is also renowned for claiming to be the inventor of the French dip sandwich.
The restaurant has been located at 1001 North Alameda Street, on the edge of Chinatown, in the Historical District of Los Angeles, two blocks north of Olvera Street, and close to Union Station, since 1951.

==History==
Philippe Mathieu emigrated from France to Buffalo, New York, in 1901, moving to Los Angeles in 1903. He opened a deli with his brother, Arbin, shortly after arriving. In 1908 he opened his first Philippe restaurant at 300 N. Alameda Street, where he served roast beef, roast pork, roast lamb, liver pâté and blood sausage. Mathieu&#x27;s restaurants were in L.A.&#x27;s traditional Frenchtown neighborhood, which was razed to build Los Angeles City Hall.

In 1911, the Mathieu brothers opened the New Poodle Dog French Restaurant at 156 North Spring Street. The New Poodle was a white tablecloth restaurant, and after two years, they closed it and opened another inexpensive place at 617 North Alameda. In 1918, Philippe moved the restaurant to 246 Aliso Street, where he first served his French dipped sandwiches.

In 1925, to avoid frequent rent increases, Mathieu bought his own property at 364 Aliso Street. Two years later, he sold the restaurant to a lawyer whose name is unknown, who failed at running the restaurant. A few months later, in 1927, Mathieu bought back the restaurant and sold it to brothers David and Harry Martin, making good on his promise to his wife to retire at 50; Mathieu died in 1960 at the age of 72. The Martins and their in-laws the Binders have run Philippe&#x27;s ever since. John and Richard Binder took over running the restaurant following the retirement of their father William &quot;Bill&quot; Binder in 1985.

From 1927 to 1941, Philippe&#x27;s was open 24 hours a day. In 1951, the Martins moved Philippe&#x27;s to its present location at 1001 N. Alameda Street due to the construction of the Hollywood Freeway.

Cole&#x27;s Pacific Electric Buffet claims to have existed before Philippe&#x27;s, but Cole&#x27;s closed for renovations in March 2007 and reopened in December 2008. Philippe&#x27;s claims to be the longest &quot;continuously&quot; operating restaurant in Los Angeles.

The restaurant is featured in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; Episode 413.

===French dip sandwich===
The origins of the French dip sandwich have been debated for many years. Cole&#x27;s Pacific Electric Buffet also claims to have invented the sandwich in 1908. There are three versions of how Philippe&#x27;s French dipped sandwich originated:

* In 1951, Mathieu told a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter, &quot;One day a customer saw some gravy in the bottom of a large pan of roast meat. He asked me if I would mind dipping one side of the French roll in that gravy. I did, and right away five or six others wanted the same.&quot; He quickly ran out of gravy. &quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;it put me wise.&quot; The next day he had a gallon of gravy ready, but so many people wanted dip sandwiches that he still ran out.
* An alternative explanation bases the invention in frugality. A fireman came into the restaurant when there were leftover rolls, which Mathieu would use up, although they were stale. The fireman complained that the roll was dry, so Philippe dipped it in &quot;jus&quot;, basically to get rid of the customer. This alternative is plausible since Mathieu may have preferred to credit a customer rather than waste a stale roll.
* The most common story is that Mathieu accidentally dropped a roll in pan drippings, and the police officer who had ordered the sandwich agreed to eat it anyway. This explanation is less likely, since the &quot;happy accident&quot; theory of food origins is typically used when there is no alternative explanation.

Originally, Mathieu referred to this as a dip sandwich. The restaurant was colloquially known as &quot;Frenchy&#x27;s&quot;, which eventually developed into a &quot;French dip sandwich&quot;.

==Menu==
Philippe&#x27;s is a traditional delicatessen-type sit-down restaurant, having old-fashioned traditions such as rows of tables shared by several parties, wood shavings scattered on the floor, dark brown wooden walls and floor, and newspapers from historical U.S. events that happened from the time the restaurant opened to the 1980s. Wall-mounted displays are dedicated to circuses, and to the history of railroading Los Angeles, from the Los Angeles Historical Railroad Society. The building has two stories, both with tables for eating, and is located one block away from Union Station. The skyscrapers of downtown are not visible from the restaurant (at street level), despite its proximity.

The restaurant is famous for attracting hungry patrons from all walks of life, from poverty-stricken, to working class, to the city&#x27;s elites. At peak times, customers often find themselves standing in lines that can be ten deep as they wait for waitresses to prepare their meals at one of the serving stations at the restaurant&#x27;s counter. Meals are served cafeteria-style on paper plates, and customers carry their food on trays to their tables. The egalitarian effect of the restaurant has been noted, as people from various economic strata bump elbows at the long communal tables and ask each other to pass the jars of Philippe&#x27;s homemade mustard. In 2008 the Los Angeles Department of Public Health ordered the traditional mustard jars and spoons to be removed from the tables as unsanitary; after a brief controversy, the jars were replaced by plastic squeeze bottles, and the mustard was restored to the tables.

In addition to their main attraction of French dip sandwiches, other old-fashioned foods are served, including freshly made soups, beef stew, chili, baked apples, and pickled pigs&#x27; feet. Sides include potato salad, macaroni salad, and coleslaw. Jars of purple pickled eggs are arrayed on the counter. Healthier menu items, such as turkey sandwiches and salads, were added to the menu following Bill Binder&#x27;s retirement in 1985.

Philippe&#x27;s serves cans of soft drinks, freshly brewed iced tea, lemonade, coffee, select wines, and beer. Homemade wine was once available. The current owner, a wine aficionado, added a small selection of California wines to the menu. Philippe&#x27;s was famous for serving cups of regular coffee for 9 cents, in honor of old-fashioned prices. On January 25, 2012, it was announced that on February 2 the price would be raised to 45 cents. Prior to this, the price was last raised from 5 cents in 1977.

On its 85th, 90th, 95th and 100th anniversaries, French dip sandwiches were sold for 10 cents and coffee for 5 cents for a few hours during its celebration.

<doc id="755249" wikidata="Q4041270" url="?curid=755249" title="If Americans Knew">
<text>If Americans Knew is a nonprofit organization based in Riverside County in Southern California, that focuses on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the foreign policy of the United States regarding the Middle East, offering analysis of American media coverage of these issues. The group&#x27;s website declares its aim is to provide &quot;what every American needs to know about Israel/Palestine.&quot; The site is critical of U.S. financial and military support of Israel. It has accused &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other mainstream news organizations of being biased in favour of Israel.

In addition to its founder, the freelance journalist Alison Weir, board members include Paul Findley, a former United States Representative and author of &quot;They Dare to Speak Out: People and Institutions Confront Israel&#x27;s Lobby&quot;, and Andrew Killgore, a former ambassador of the United States to Qatar.

==Background==
According to the organization&#x27;s website, founder Alison Weir traveled independently throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2001, where she found a situation she considered to be different from what was being reported by the American media. She stated that the U.S. press portrayal was significantly at odds with that reported by media throughout the rest of the world, and that American citizens were being misinformed and uninformed on what she considered one of the most significant issues affecting them today. Weir therefore founded an organization that would reflect what she considered to be a more objective viewpoint.

In addition to its information website, If Americans Knew places billboards and advertisements about U.S. financial support for Israel and founder Weir publishes op-eds about the topic in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;.

==Positions==
The organization&#x27;s stated goal is &quot;to inform and educate the American public on issues of major significance that are unreported, underreported, or misreported in the American media,&quot; going on to say: &quot;It is the goal of If Americans Knew to inform the American public accurately about [Israel-Palestine]. Most of all, it is to inform Americans about our enormous, and too often invisible, personal connection to it.&quot;.

If Americans Knew holds that United States&#x27; support of Israel should be reduced on the grounds that it is not in American interest or aligned with American principles, costs American taxpayers billions, is increasingly imperiling American lives, and prevents peace.

It asserts that U.S. support of Israel has long been driven by lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, often via AIPAC, over the objections of State Department and Pentagon experts, and in recent years by the efforts of a &quot;growing number of individuals with close ties to Israel (known as neoconservatives)&quot; in high-level U.S. Government positions.

It believes that there is a &quot;cover-up of appalling proportions&quot; about Israel/Palestine in the American news media. In 2005, it published a study critical of &quot;The New York Times&quot; coverage of Israeli and Palestinian deaths, and met with then &quot;New York Times&quot; Public Editor Daniel Okrent to discuss their study. In subsequent column Okrent mentioned the meeting but dismissed IAK&#x27;s conclusions.

It has drawn attention to the number of Jewish judges on the US Supreme Court, writing of Barack Obama&#x27;s appointment of Merrick Garland that it is &quot;questionable for one small group to have enormously disproportionate representation on the highest court of the land&quot;.

It falsely claimed the 2020 Beirut explosion was caused by Israel.

Executive Director Alison Weir writes that ending U.S. military aid to Israel would &quot;help bring peace to the Middle East, build a safer world and alleviate massive misery.&quot; She has &quot;accused American supporters of Israel of fomenting wars and involving the United States in them, has said that Nazi and Zionist leaders colluded during World War II, and has claimed that Israel harvests Palestinian organs.&quot;

==Reception==
If Americans Knew was accused of antisemitism by Jewish Voice for Peace, U.S. Campaign to End the Occupation and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). The ADL has called If Americans Knew an &quot;anti-Israel organization&quot; (placing it in its &quot;Top 10&quot; &quot;most influential and active anti-Israel groups&quot; in the US in 2013) and stated that &quot;Weir&#x27;s criticism of Israel has, at times, crossed the line into anti-Semitism.&quot; It cited Weir&#x27;s use of a quotation by Israel Shahak that characterized beliefs of certain Israelis as &quot;such a ruthless and supremacist faith.&quot; Weir stated that she considered this quoted characterization as not pertaining to the mainstream of Judaism, and has demanded that the ADL correct what she termed &quot;defamatory and inaccurate statements.&quot;

Jewish Voice for Peace criticised IAK for arguing that America is innocent of perpetuating injustice in the Middle East, for its &quot;tail wags the dog&quot; approach to Israel–US relations, and its devaluing of both Jewish and Palestinian perspectives on the conflict: &quot;according to Weir and If Americans Knew, only non-Arab, non-Muslim, non-Palestinian, and non-Jewish voices can be trusted to speak the truth, based solely on their ethnic or religious identity&quot;.

In 2016, it was recommended in Salon.com by Stanford University professor David Palumbo-Liu as an alternative source of information on Israel, but he withdrew the recommendation after controversy.

In 2006, If Americans Knew was described as &quot;valuable&quot; by the media monitoring organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR).

<doc id="755261" wikidata="Q459197" url="?curid=755261" title="Armand Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, 5th Duke of Richelieu">
<text>Armand Emmanuel Sophie Septimanie de Vignerot du Plessis, 5th [[Duke of Richelieu]] and Fronsac (25 September 176617 May 1822), was a French statesman during the Bourbon Restoration. He was known by the courtesy title of Count of Chinon until 1788, then Duke of Fronsac until 1791, when he succeeded his father as Duke of Richelieu.

As a royalist, during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, he served as a senior officer in the Imperial Russian Army, achieving the grade of major general. Following the Bourbon Restoration, he returned to his homeland and was twice Prime Minister of France.

==Early years==

He was born in Paris, the son of Antoine de Vignerot du Plessis, 4th Duke of Richelieu, and of his wife, Adélaïde de Hautefort. His father was the son and heir of King Louis XV of France&#x27;s favourite, Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, 3rd Duke of Richelieu.

Known by the courtesy title of &quot;comte de Chinon&quot; during the lifetime of his distinguished grandfather, he was married on 4 May 1782 at the age of fifteen to Alexandrine Rosalie Sabine de Rochechouart-Faudoas (13 December 17689 December 1830), a hunchbacked child of fourteen. Immediately after the wedding, Chinon embarked upon the Grand Tour with his tutor, visiting the cities of Geneva, Florence and Vienna. Because of Rosalie&#x27;s deformity, it is unlikely the marriage was ever consummated. During their long marriage, which was often punctuated with periods of extended separation, the two were never more than formal with each other.

After three years of foreign travel, he entered Queen Marie Antoinette&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons and the next year assumed his aged grandfather&#x27;s place at court as a &quot;premier gentilhomme de la chambre&quot; to King Louis XVI. At the Palace of Versailles, it was his duty to attend the King during the highly ritualized daily &quot;lever&quot; and &quot;coucher&quot; ceremonies. Despite his young age, he had a reputation at court for puritanical austerity. After his grandfather died and his father succeeded to the dukedom of Richelieu in 1788, Chinon became known as the Duke of Fronsac (&quot;duc de Fronsac&quot;).

By 1789, he was a captain in the Esterhazy Regiment of Hussars. On 5 October of that year, he was in Paris when the March on Versailles began. Worried about the safety of the royal family, he disguised himself as one of the crowd and started out on foot to Versailles in order to warn the King and Queen. Unable to break through the large number of people on the road, he took a shortcut through the woods. He arrived just as the angry mob was converging on the palace. He went immediately to the Queen and convinced her to seek refuge in the King&#x27;s apartments, thus arguably saving her life.

==Exile==

On Marie Antoinette&#x27;s direction, he left Paris in 1790 for Vienna to discuss the recent events of the French Revolution with her older brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. Before he got there, however, Joseph died. Instead, Richelieu attended the coronation of the new Emperor, Leopold II, in Frankfurt and then followed the Habsburg court back to Vienna. There, he renewed a friendship with Prince Charles de Ligne, the son of the Austrian diplomat, the Prince de Ligne. Together, they decided to join the Imperial Russian Army as volunteers. Accompanied by another friend, the Comte de Langeron, they reached the Russian headquarters at Bender, Moldavia on 21 November. The three were present at Alexander Suvorov&#x27;s capture of Izmail. For his service in that battle, Fronsac was decorated by the Russian Empress Catherine the Great with the Order of St. George and given a golden sword.

On the death of his father in February 1791, he succeeded to the title of Duke of Richelieu. Because of an unwillingness on the part of various nobles to serve in the royal household, King Louis XVI soon afterwards summoned him back to Paris in order for him to resume his position as a &quot;premier gentilhomme&quot; at the Tuileries Palace. He was not, however, sufficiently in the confidence of the court to be informed of the projected flight to Varennes on the night of 20 June 1791.
Feeling that his role at court was useless in helping the King deal with all the revolutionary agitation that was embroiling Paris, Richelieu in July obtained with royal permission a passport from the National Constituent Assembly in order to return to Vienna as a diplomat. After a short stay in Austria, however, Richelieu joined the counter-revolutionary &quot;émigré&quot; army of Louis XVI&#x27;s cousin, the Prince of Condé, which was headquartered in the German frontier town of Koblenz. Later, after Condé&#x27;s forces had suffered several defeats, Catherine the Great offered positions in her army to the officers serving under Condé. Richelieu accepted.

In the Russian army, he achieved the rank of Major General but later resigned his commission after what he considered an unwarranted reprimand by Catherine&#x27;s successor, Emperor Paul I. His prospects brightened, however, after Paul was murdered in 1801. The new Russian emperor, Alexander I, was one of his friends. The erasure of Richelieu&#x27;s name from the list of prohibited &quot;émigrés&quot; who could not legally return to France, which Richelieu on his own had previously been unable to secure from Napoleon Bonaparte, was accorded on the request of Alexander&#x27;s new government, and in 1803 Alexander appointed him as the governor of Odessa. Two years later, he became Governor-General of a large swathe of land recently conquered from the Ottoman Empire and called &quot;New Russia&quot;, which included the territories of Kherson, Ekaterinoslav and the Crimea. He commanded a division in the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812, and was engaged in frequent expeditions to the Caucasus. Richelieu played a role during Ottoman plague epidemic which hit Odessa in the autumn 1812. Dismissive of any attempt to forge a compromise between quarantine requirements and free trade, Prince Kuriakin (the Saint Petersburg-based High Commissioner for Sanitation) countermanded Richelieu&#x27;s orders. In the eleven years of his administration, Odessa greatly increased in size and importance, eventually becoming the third largest city in the empire by population. The grateful Odessans erected a bronze monument to him in 1828. These are the famous Odessa Steps, crowned by a statue of Richelieu.

==Return to France==

Richelieu returned to France in 1814. On the return of Napoleon from Elba, he accompanied Louis XVIII as far as Lille. From there, he chose to return to Vienna in order to rejoin the Russian army, believing that he could best serve the interests of the new king and of France by attaching himself to the headquarters of Tsar Alexander. 

Richelieu&#x27;s character and antecedents alike marked him out as a valuable support for the monarchy at the beginning of the Bourbon Restoration. Though the bulk of his confiscated estates were lost beyond recall, he did not share the angry resentment of most of the returning &quot;émigrés&quot;, from whose company and intrigues he had held himself aloof during his long Russian exile. More specifically, he did not share their delusions as to the possibility of undoing the work of the French Revolution. As the personal friend of the Russian emperor, his influence in the councils of the Allies had been of great service. Despite this fact, however, he refused the offer of a place in the ministry of the former revolutionary and Bonapartist Talleyrand, pleading both a long absence from France and an ignorance of its conditions. Eventually, though, after Talleyrand&#x27;s resignation in advance of the opening session of the new Ultraroyalist Chamber of Deputies (the famous Chambre introuvable), Richelieu decided (after much urging from Mathieu de Montmorency) to succeed Talleyrand as the Prime Minister of France, though – as he himself said – he did not know the face of a single one of his colleagues. On 26 September 1815 he was appointed President du Conseil (Prime Minister), a position he held until 29 December 1818, when he was succeeded by Jean Joseph Dessolles. During this tenure, he was also the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

It was mainly due to his efforts that France was so quickly relieved of the burden of the Allied army of occupation. In order to achieve this goal, he attended the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, where he was informed in confidence of an Allied pledge to interfere internally in France if a revival of revolutionary trouble was to occur. It was partly owing to this reassuring knowledge that he left office in December the same year, on the refusal of his colleagues to support a modification of the electoral law. After the murder of the king&#x27;s nephew, the Duke of Berry, and the enforced retirement of Decazes, he was again called to the premiership (21 February 1821); but his position was untenable due to political attacks from the &quot;Ultras&quot; on one side and the Liberals on the other. On 12 December 1821, he again resigned.

He died, of a stroke, on 17 May 1822.

<text>The National Press Club is a professional organization and social community in Washington, D.C. for journalists and communications professionals. It hosts public and private gatherings with invited speakers from public life. The club also offers event space to outside groups to host business meetings, news conferences, industry gatherings, and social events. It was founded in 1908.
The club has been visited by most U.S. presidents; since Warren Harding, many have also been members and spoken from the club&#x27;s podium. Others who have appeared at the club include monarchs, prime ministers, premiers, members of Congress, Cabinet officials, ambassadors, scholars, entertainers, business leaders, and athletes. The club&#x27;s emblem is the owl, in deference to wisdom, awareness and nights spent working.

==History==
===Founding===
On March 12, 1908, 32 newspapermen met at the Washington Chamber of Commerce to discuss starting a club for journalists. At the meeting they agreed to meet again on March 29 in the F Street parlor of the Willard Hotel to frame a constitution for the National Press Club. The Club founders laid down a credo which promised &quot;to promote social enjoyment among the members, to cultivate literary taste, to encourage friendly intercourse among newspapermen and those with whom they were thrown in contact in the pursuit of their vocation, to aid members in distress and to foster the ethical standards of the profession.&quot;

With $300, the founding members moved into its first club quarters on the second floor of 1205 F Street NW. By 1909, the club had outgrown its new quarters and moved above Rhodes Tavern at the corner of 15th and F Streets. Once again the club outgrew its residence and moved to the Albee Building (formerly Riggs) at 15th and G Streets.

===Membership===
At its founding, the club was only open to white men. But in 1955, the club opened to non-white men. In 1970, it was opened to women. Prior to these changes in membership, non-white men and women had their own designated press clubs.

===Women&#x27;s National Press Club===
In 1919, female journalists founded the Women&#x27;s National Press Club, when the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpcf.org/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 1970, members of the Women&#x27;s National Press Club voted to allow men into their club and renamed it the Washington Press Club. The next month, the National Press Club voted 227 to 56 to admit women. In 1972, journalist Gloria Steinem, a feminist leader and founder of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, was the first woman to speak at the National Press Club, although first lady Eleanor Roosevelt attended lunch at the then all-male club in 1938. In 1985, the Washington Press Club and the National Press Club merged under the banner of the National Press Club.
The Washington Press Club Foundation (WPCF) continues as a nonprofit organization to promote equality, education and excellence among journalists in print and broadcast media. It has a Women in Journalism Oral History Project.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpcf.org/interviewees&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Oral History videos (Mary Garber, Betsy Wade, Dorothy Gilliam, Eileen Shanahan, Ruth Cowan Nash) are archived by C-SPAN.

The Washington Press Club Foundation also arranges journalism internships for women and minorities in partnership with Washington DC–based news bureaus.

Since 1945, an annual (late January - early February) Washington Press Club Foundation Salute to Congress, now called the &#x27;Washington Press Club Foundation Congressional Dinner, is its signature fundraising event, with its video archived by C-SPAN since 1985.

===Capital Press Club===
African-American journalists founded the Capital Press Club in 1944. The first African-American male journalist (Louis Lautier) was accepted for National Press Club membership in 1955. Reporting on that event, &quot;TIME&quot; said:Negroes are admitted to the club&#x27;s big banquet hall when it is rented out to other organizations, but only two have ever ventured into the members&#x27; private dining room or Press Club bar. One, William Hastie, now a federal judge, was refused service; the other, C.I.O. Aide George Weaver, was served luncheon, but his newsman host got an anonymous letter warning him never to bring a Negro again.

===National Press Building===

In 1925, National Press Club president Henry L. Sweinhart appointed a special building committee to plan for a permanent club headquarters. The Ebbitt Hotel was demolished, and the Ebbitt Grill moved to the Albee building. The new National Press Building, at 14th and F Streets NW, was completed in August 1927, and included retail space and office space intended for Washington, D.C.–based news bureaus with the club occupying the 13th and 14th floors. In order to increase their funding, the club made a deal with movie studio 20th Century Fox to build a theater as part of the building.

In 1932, Bascom N. Timmons, who established an independent news bureau in Washington, D.C., became president of the press club. He worked to save the press club building in New York City from foreclosure by persuading President Franklin Roosevelt to sign an amendment to the federal bankruptcy law that blocked pending foreclosure and kept the building open.

The National Press Building was renovated from 1984 to 1985, in conjunction with the development of the adjacent The Shops at National Place. Beginning in 2004, a 10-year, $15 million second renovation occurred. In 2011, the building was sold to Quadrangle Development Corp. and AEW Core Property Trust (U.S.) for $167.5 million. The owners placed the building, assessed at $237.5 million, up for sale in August 2014.

The National Press Club also rents space to other organizations.

===Continuation===
During the Great Depression, the club struggled financially as it was beginning to be recognized as an influential group. It managed to find additional funding from wealthy individuals.

Regular weekly luncheons for speakers began in 1932 with an appearance by president-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. Since then the club has hosted an average of 70 luncheons each year with prominent people. Over the years Nikita Khrushchev, Soong Mei-ling (Madame Chiang Kai-shek), Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Muhammad Ali, Charles de Gaulle, Robert Redford, Boris Yeltsin, Elizabeth Taylor, Nelson Mandela, Yasser Arafat, Dalai Lama, Angelina Jolie, George Carlin, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Elizabeth Warren have all spoken at the club.

Speaking at the National Press Club to mark his retirement, CBS commentator Eric Sevareid called the club the &quot;&quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot; of American journalists&quot; and said &quot;It&#x27;s the Westminster Hall, it&#x27;s Delphi, it&#x27;s Mecca, the Wailing Wall for everybody in this country having anything to do with the news business; the only hallowed place I know of that&#x27;s absolutely bursting with irreverence.&quot;

The Broadcast Operations Center opened in 2006. Located on the 4th floor of the National Press Building, a full-service video production with facilities for webcast and video conference solutions, video production capabilities, global transmission portals, and web enabled multimedia.

==Professional development==
The National Press Club Journalism Institute, the non-profit arm of the National Press Club, trains communications professionals in a changing media environment, provides scholarships to the next generation of journalists, recognizes excellence in journalism, and promotes a free press. The institute also trains working journalists through its Bloomberg Center for Electronic Journalism, and provides research for communications professionals through its Eric Friedheim Journalism Library.

== Awards ==
The organization administers the annual Freedom of the Press Award, which honors two recipients, one foreign and one domestic, who have demonstrated the &quot;principles of press freedom and open government.&quot; Among the winners include Brian Karem, Rana Ayyub, Joseph Hosey, Tim Tai, Mahmoud Abou Zeid, and Ahmed Humaidan. Anna Politkovskaya was awarded posthumously in 2007.

In December 2017, the National Press Club awarded the John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award to Mexican journalist Emilio Gutiérrez, who faced deportation from the United States, &quot;on behalf of Mexico&#x27;s besieged journalists.&quot;

<text>The Jakaltek (&quot;Jacaltec&quot;) language, also known as Jakalteko (&quot;Jacalteco&quot;) or Poptiʼ, is a Mayan language from the Q’anjob’alan-chujean branch spoken by the Jakaltek people in some municipalities in the state of Chiapas, Mexico and the municipality of Jacaltenango in the department of Huehuetenango, Guatemala in the border between both countries. Jakaltek is closely related with the Q&#x27;anjob&#x27;al and Akatek language and more distantly related with the Tojol-ab&#x27;al, Chuj and Mocho&#x27;. In Mexico it is also known as Ab&#x27;xub&#x27;al.

== History ==
Jakaltek was the language spoken by the population of the site of El Lagartero, in the present day municipality of La Trinitaria in Chiapas, Mexico, the site was inhabited from 300 AD to 1400 AD between the late classic and postclassic period of Mesoamerica.

==Distribution==
In Mexico, Jakaltek is mainly spoken in the state of Chiapas in the communities of Bienestar Social, Flor de Mayo, Guadalupe Victoria, Ojo de Agua, Pacayalito and Huixquilar from the municipality of Amatenango de la Frontera, in Los Pocitos from the municipality of Bella Vista, in El Mango, Frontera Comalapa and Sunzapote from the municipality of Frontera Comalapa and in El Vergel Dos, La Campana, La Gloria, El Colorado and Nuevo Villaflores from the municipality of La Trinitaria. There are also Jakaltek communities in Campeche in the municipalities of Campeche and Champotón.

Municipalities in Huehuetenango where Jakaltek is spoken include the following (&quot;Variación Dialectal en Poptiʼ, 2000&quot;).

* Concepción Huista
* Jacaltenango (including the following villages)
** &quot;San Marcos Huista&quot;
** &quot;San Andrés Huista&quot;
** &quot;Yinhchʼewex&quot;
* Nentón
* San Antonio Huista
* Santa Ana Huista
* Buxup
* Tzisbʼaj

==Phonology==
The Eastern Jakaltek language includes the following phonemes. The orthography used by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala is on the left, the other main orthography is on the right.

It also has the vowels a , e , i , o , u 
Eastern Jakaltek is one of the few languages besides the Malagasy language of Madagascar to make use of an n-trema character in its alphabet. In both languages, the n-trema represents a velar nasal consonant (like &quot;ng&quot; in &quot;bang&quot;).

== Use in media ==
Jakaltek-language programming is carried by the INPI&#x27;s radio station XEVFS, broadcasting from Las Margaritas, Chiapas.

==Grammar==
The Jakaltek language has a verb–subject–object syntax. Like many Native American languages, Jakaltek has complex agglutinative morphology and uses ergative–absolutive case alignment. It is divided in two dialects, Eastern and Western Jakalteko. &quot;Eastern and Western Jakalteko understand each other&#x27;s spoken languages, but not written text.&quot;

Jakaltek is unusual in that it has four systems of noun and numeral classifiers.

Owing to Jakaltek&#x27;s dissimilarity with Indo-European languages, the reasonably healthy linguistic population and the relative ease of access to Guatemala, Jakaltek has become a favorite of students of linguistic typology.
