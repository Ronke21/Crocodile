<text>The Exorcist is a 1973 American supernatural horror film directed by William Friedkin from a screenplay by William Peter Blatty, based on his 1971 novel. The film stars Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, and Linda Blair, and follows the demonic possession of a young girl and the attempt to rescue her through an exorcism by two Catholic priests.

Blatty, who also produced, and Friedkin, his choice as director, had difficulty casting the film. Their choice of relative unknowns Burstyn, Blair, and Miller, instead of major stars, drew opposition from executives at Warner Bros. Principal photography was also difficult. Many cast and crew were injured, some died, and unusual accidents delayed shooting. Production took twice as long as scheduled and cost almost three times the initial budget; the many mishaps have led to a belief that the film was cursed.

&quot;The Exorcist&quot; was released in 25 theaters in the United States on December 26, 1973. Reviews were mixed, but audiences waited in long lines during cold weather; the sold-out shows were even more profitable for Warner Bros., who had booked it into those theaters under four wall distribution rental agreements, the first time a major studio had done that. Some viewers suffered adverse physical reactions, fainting or vomiting to shocking scenes such as a realistic cerebral angiography. Many children were allowed to see it, leading to charges that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) had accommodated the studio by giving the film an R rating instead of an X rating to ensure the troubled production its commercial success. Several cities attempted to ban it outright or prevent children from attending. At the end of its original theatrical run, the film grossed $193 million, and has a lifetime gross of $441 million with subsequent re-releases.

The cultural conversation around the film helped it become the first horror film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as nine others. Blatty won Best Adapted Screenplay, while the sound engineers took Best Sound. It has had several sequels and was the highest-grossing R-rated horror film (unadjusted for inflation) until 2017&#x27;s &quot;It&quot;. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; significantly influenced pop culture, and several publications regard it as one of the greatest films ever made. In 2010, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. 

==Plot==
In northern Iraq, priest Lankester Merrin takes part in an archaeological dig in the ancient ruins of Hatra. During the dig, he finds a stone talisman of a winged being that evokes a concerned look on his face. He then has a vision in which a giant version of the same being appears nearby, silently confronting him.

In Georgetown, Washington, D.C., actress Chris MacNeil is starring in a film directed by her friend Burke Dennings. MacNeil, along with her 12-year-old daughter Regan, rents a luxurious house with hired help. Meanwhile, Father Damien Karras, a psychiatrist who counsels Georgetown University priests, visits his ailing mother in New York City. He later confides to a colleague that he is having a crisis of faith.

Chris hosts a party with Karras&#x27;s friend, Father Dyer, who explains Karras&#x27;s role as counselor and notes his mother&#x27;s recent death. Regan, seemingly unwell, appears and urinates before Chris comforts her. Regan&#x27;s bed shakes violently after Chris returns her to it. Later, Dyer consoles Karras, guilty at not having been with his mother when she died.

Regan&#x27;s personality becomes violent. Medical tests find no physical cause. During a house call, Regan exhibits abnormal strength. One night, Chris finds the house empty except for a sleeping Regan; Dennings is found dead at the bottom of a set of public stairs that begin beneath Regan&#x27;s window. Detective William Kinderman questions Karras, confiding that Dennings&#x27;s head was turned backward. Regan&#x27;s body becomes covered with sores. Kinderman tells Chris that the only plausible explanation for Dennings&#x27;s death is that he was pushed from Regan&#x27;s window. As Kinderman leaves, Regan has another violent fit, stabbing her vagina with a crucifix and turning her head backward. She is confined to her bedroom. Now convinced that her daughter is possessed, Chris seeks out Karras, who visits Regan. The possessed Regan claims to be the Devil, and vomits into Karras&#x27;s face while speaking in tongues. The demon says it will remain in Regan until she is dead. At night, Chris&#x27;s assistant calls Karras to the house; he concludes that an exorcism is warranted. His superior grants permission on the condition that an experienced priest lead the ritual. Merrin, having performed an exorcism before, is summoned.

Merrin arrives at the house. As the two priests read from the Roman Ritual, the demon curses them. The priests rest and Merrin, shaking, takes nitroglycerin. Karras enters the bedroom where the demon appears as his mother, perturbing Karras despite his denials. Merrin excuses Karras and continues the exorcism by himself. Karras assures Chris that Regan will not die and re-enters the room, finding Merrin dead from a heart attack while Regan watches and laughs. Karras beats the possessed Regan in a fit of rage and demands that the demon take him instead. The demon rips the medallion of Saint Joseph from Karras&#x27;s neck and possesses him, freeing Regan in the process. Karras jumps out the window, tumbling down the stone stairs outside. Chris and Kinderman enter the room. Chris embraces the healed Regan, and Kinderman surveys the scene. Outside, Dyer administers the dying Karras last rites.

The MacNeils prepare to leave, and Father Dyer says goodbye. Despite having no memory of her ordeal, Regan, moved by the sight of Dyer&#x27;s clerical collar, kisses him on the cheek. As the MacNeils leave, Chris gives Dyer the medallion found in Regan&#x27;s room. Dyer briefly examines the steps where Karras died before walking away.

==Production==
===Development===

Aspects of Blatty&#x27;s novel were inspired by the 1949 exorcism performed by Jesuit priest William S. Bowdern. It sold poorly until Blatty captivated &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;″s audience with a discussion of whether the devil existed. Soon afterwards the novel topped the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list.

Despite Blatty&#x27;s previous screenwriting experience on Blake Edwards&#x27; films, studios had been uninterested in adapting &quot;The Exorcist&quot; before publication. Lew Grade made a modest offer for the rights that Blatty said later he would have accepted due to his difficult financial circumstances, but for his requirement that he produce. Shirley MacLaine, a friend of Blatty&#x27;s, had been interested, but wanted someone other than Blatty to produce. A later agreement to co-produce with Paul Monash, producer of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, collapsed over script differences and Blatty&#x27;s discovery that Monash was trying to wrest control of the film.

===Writing===
Blatty&#x27;s screenplay follows the plot of his novel closely, but narrows the story&#x27;s focus. Subplots like the desecration of the churches and the subsequent relationship that develops between Karras and Kinderman, Karras&#x27;s efforts to convince the Church bureaucracy to approve the exorcism, and the ongoing medical investigations of Regan&#x27;s condition are less prominent in the film, as are supporting characters including Chris&#x27;s household staff, Dennings, and Regan&#x27;s father. The overall time frame is condensed.

Some scenes, particularly those with sexual content, were toned down for the film adaptation since an actress of approximately Regan&#x27;s age was expected to be cast. The scene where Regan masturbates with a crucifix was, in the book, more prolonged and explicit, with Regan seriously injuring herself yet attaining orgasm. The film also excludes the possessed Regan&#x27;s constant diarrhea, giving her room a strong, foul odor.

Blatty also made the screenplay unambiguous about Regan&#x27;s condition. In his novel, every symptom and behavior she exhibits that might indicate possession is counterbalanced with a reference to an actual case where the same phenomena were found to have natural, scientific causes. Aside from Karras&#x27; initial professional skepticism, that perspective is absent from the film.

===Casting===

The lead roles, particularly Regan, were not easily cast. Although many major stars of the era were considered for them, Blatty and Friedkin ultimately went with lesser-known actors, to the studio&#x27;s consternation.

====Chris and Father Karras====
Jack Nicholson was considered for Karras, and Paul Newman was interested, before Blatty hired Stacy Keach. Three A-list actresses of the time—Audrey Hepburn, Anne Bancroft and Jane Fonda—were considered for Chris, but rejected the part. Friedkin also rejected Blatty&#x27;s friend Shirley MacLaine since she had starred in &quot;The Possession of Joel Delaney&quot;, a similar film. After meeting Carol Burnett, Friedkin believed she had the range beyond her comic television persona. Blatty agreed, but the studio turned her down. Ellen Burstyn received the part after she told Friedkin she was &quot;destined&quot; to play Chris, discussing the Catholic upbringing she had later rejected. Studio head Ted Ashley vigorously opposed casting her, but relented after no other alternatives emerged.

Friedkin had first spoken to stage actor and playwright Jason Miller after a performance of his play &quot;That Championship Season&quot;, and given him a copy of the novel. Miller had received a Catholic education and studied to be a Jesuit priest for three years at Catholic University of America until experiencing a spiritual crisis similar to Karras&#x27;s. Upon reading the novel, he told Friedkin &quot;[Karras] is me&quot;. Friedkin responded that Keach had already been signed, but granted his request for a screen test. During the test, Miller and Burstyn performed the scene where Chris informs Karras that she suspects Regan might be possessed. He then filmed Burstyn interviewing Miller about his life and asked him to recite Mass as if for the first time. After viewing the footage the next morning, Friedkin realized that Miller&#x27;s &quot;dark good looks, haunted eyes, quiet intensity, and low, compassionate voice&quot; were exactly what the part needed. The studio then bought out Keach&#x27;s contract.

====Regan====
Directors considered for &quot;The Exorcist&quot; doubted a young actress could carry the film; Mike Nichols had turned it down for that reason, but would later regret it. The first actresses considered had been in other successful films and television series. Pamelyn Ferdin was turned down as too familiar. Denise Nickerson, who had played Violet Beauregarde in &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, said in later interviews her family found the script too dark. Janet Leigh would not let her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis, audition. Friedkin was considering older actresses until Elinore Blair came in unannounced with her daughter Linda, whose credits were primarily in modeling and a single soap opera role. Friedkin later recalled her as &quot;[S]mart but not precocious ... cute but not beautiful. A normal, happy 12-year-old girl&quot;. He asked if she knew what &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was about; she told him she had read the book. &quot;[I]t&#x27;s about a little girl who gets possessed by the devil and does a whole bunch of bad things.&quot; Friedkin then asked her what she meant. &quot;[S]he pushes a man out of her bedroom window and she hits her mother across the face and she masturbates with a crucifix.&quot; Friedkin then asked Linda if she knew what masturbation meant. &quot;It&#x27;s like jerking off, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;, and she giggled a little bit. &quot;Have you ever done that?&quot; he asked. &quot;Sure; haven&#x27;t you?&quot; she responded.

Blair was cast after tests with Burstyn. &quot;After all these difficult scenes she&#x27;d tiptoe around and giggle, after every bit&quot;, Blatty recalled. Friedkin said &quot;there wasn&#x27;t one other [actress] I would have considered&quot;. He had planned to use Blair&#x27;s electronically treated voice for Pazuzu&#x27;s dialogue, but decided that a more androgynous voice was better, and cast experienced voice actress Mercedes McCambridge. McCambridge ate raw eggs, drank whiskey and chainsmoked cigarettes to make Pazuzu&#x27;s voice sound as intimidating as possible. After filming, the studio did not credit her, until Screen Actors Guild arbitration. McCambridge&#x27;s name was included in the credits on all but the first 30 prints, but the dispute prevented the release of a soundtrack album with excerpts of dialogue. Warner Bros. reportedly forced Friedkin to use Eileen Dietz, then Blair&#x27;s senior for 15 years, as Blair&#x27;s stunt double. She stood in for Blair in the crucifix scene, the fistfight with Father Karras, and others too violent or disturbing for Blair to perform. She recalled that Friedkin gave her no notes and said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t playing a little girl, I was playing the demon that possessed a little girl.&quot; Dietz appears on camera as the face of Pazuzu. Blair, who recalls Friedkin telling her the film would not succeed if she was not in as many shots as possible, estimates that Dietz is in 17 seconds of the film. Dietz, angry that her contribution to the film had been minimized, claimed in the media to have performed &quot;all&quot; the possession scenes. The studio ultimately measured her screen presence at 28.25 seconds, but denied that her contribution was dramatically significant.

====Supporting roles====

Warner Bros. wanted Marlon Brando for the role of Lankester Merrin, but Friedkin refused. A Philippe Halsman photograph of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, one of Blatty&#x27;s inspirations for Father Merrin, inspired Friedkin to cast Max von Sydow instead of Paul Scofield, whom Blatty had wanted.

The film&#x27;s supporting roles were cast more quickly. At a play, Blatty and Friedkin ran into Lee J. Cobb, who was cast as Lt. Kinderman. Two priests were cast. Father William O&#x27;Malley, who had become acquainted with Blatty through his criticism of the novel, was cast as Father Dyer, whom he had considered clichéd in the novel. The Rev. Thomas Bermingham, a Georgetown professor who had assigned Blatty research on demonic possession as a student, took the role of the university president.

Jack MacGowran got the role of Dennings, which, earlier in the production, seemed to be going to J. Lee Thompson. A later cast listing adds Mary Boylan and The Rev. John Nicola, one of the film&#x27;s technical advisors, in small roles. Greek actor Titos Vandis, cast as Karras&#x27;s uncle, covered his face with a hat to avoid associations with his role in the recent Woody Allen film &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;. Friedkin cast Vasiliki Maliaros as Karras&#x27;s mother after reportedly encountering her in a Greek restaurant.

===Direction===
In addition to Nichols, many directors were considered, including Arthur Penn, Stanley Kubrick, John Boorman and Peter Bogdanovich. The studio finally hired Mark Rydell, but Blatty insisted on Friedkin, with whom he was acquainted, as he had been impressed by his film &quot;The French Connection&quot;. Blatty saw Friedkin, an acquaintance, as &quot;a director who can bring the look of documentary realism to this incredible story, and ... is never going to lie to me.&quot; The studio demurred, until &quot;Connection&quot; was released to commercial success and a Best Picture Academy Award.

During his press tour for &quot;Connection&quot;, Friedkin began reading a copy of the novel Blatty sent him. After the first 20 pages he canceled his dinner plans and finished the book, finding the story so gripping that he did not consider any problems adapting it to film. Friedkin felt that the film should unfold slowly, with audiences seeing everything that happened to Regan and the unsuccessful attempts at treating her condition. An early clash during production led to Warner Bros. telling Blatty he could not take any action against Friedkin. Afterwards, Blatty informed the studio he could no longer have any responsibility for controlling the budget; while he and Friedkin reconciled, production costs soon exceeded the initial $4.2 million ($ in ) budget.

Friedkin manipulated the actors to get genuine reactions. Unsatisfied with O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s performance as Dyer ministers to the dying Karras at the end of the film, he slapped him hard across the face to generate a deeply solemn yet literally shaken reaction for the scene, offending many Catholic crew members. He also fired blanks without warning to elicit shock from Miller for a take; Dietz recalls him also doing this during the scene where Regan assaults the doctors at the house. Friedkin also told Miller that the vomit, porridge colored to resemble pea soup and pumped through a hidden tube, would hit him in the chest during the projectile vomiting scene, and rehearsed it that way. But when filmed, the soup hit his face, resulting in his disgusted reaction.

Crewmembers found Friedkin difficult to work with. On the first day of shooting, he had a wall removed to create space for the dolly to back up from a shot of bacon frying, then sent the prop master to look for preservative-free bacon, difficult to find at the time, since he did not like the way it curled. Another crewmember recalled returning after three days of sick leave to find Friedkin still shooting the same scene. Dietz recalls the main delay being reshoots, even of scenes that had been difficult to stage and film the first time, such as Regan&#x27;s bed shaking. &quot;People were literally placing bets on what he would reshoot next.&quot; He also fired and rehired crew regularly. One crewmember recalls seeing Friedkin shake hands warmly with someone, and then seconds later tell a second person to &quot;get this guy outta here&quot;, earning him the nickname &quot;Wacky Willy&quot;.

===Cinematography===
Owen Roizman, director of photography on &quot;The French Connection&quot;, worked in this position again on &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. He was in charge of filming every scene except for the Iraqi prologue, shot by Billy Williams. Roizman and Friedkin wanted &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, like their previous film, to appear to have been shot in available light. The MacNeil house was, unlike house interiors in horror films such as &quot;Psycho&quot;, designed to look normal and inviting, but lit to suggest an ominous presence. Otherwise, Roizman said, Friedkin &quot;demanded complete realism&quot; and &quot;wanted to see pictures with glass in them, mirrors on the walls and all of the other highly reflective surfaces you would naturally find in a house[;] we never tried to cover anything up, as we would normally do for expedience in shooting.&quot; This meant that the kitchen set, with much stainless steel and glass, was &quot;virtually impossible&quot; to light beyond the practical ceiling fixtures and whatever other lights they could manage to sneak in and hide. &quot;[W]e&#x27;d walk in, hit the switch and shoot—through not much choice.&quot;

===Filming and locations===

Principal photography began August 14, 1972. Although the film is set in Washington, D.C., many interior scenes were shot in New York City. The MacNeil residence interiors were filmed at CECO Studios in Manhattan, with Karras&#x27;s confrontation with his uncle, shot at Goldwater Memorial Hospital, now the site of Cornell Tech, on Roosevelt Island in the East River between Manhattan and Queens; the scenes with Karras&#x27;s mother in the hospital were filmed at Bellevue. The scene where Father Karras listens to the tapes of Regan was filmed in the basement of Fordham University&#x27;s Keating Hall, where O&#x27;Malley was an assistant professor of theology.

The film&#x27;s opening sequences were filmed in and near Mosul, Iraq, at a time when the U.S. and Iraq did not have diplomatic relations; Warner Bros. feared that Friedkin and his crew might not be able to return. He negotiated filming arrangements directly with local officials of the ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party, who required that he hire local workers as crew and teach filmmaking to interested residents. The archaeological dig site shown is Hatra, south-west of Mosul. Temperatures during the days reached , limiting shooting to dawn and dusk.

The exterior of the MacNeil house was a family home on 36th and Prospect streets in Washington. A mansard roof was added to account for the attic scene. The neighboring stairs were padded with a half-inch () of rubber for Karras&#x27;s death. The house was set back slightly from the steps, so the crew built an eastward extension with a false front to allow the stunt double playing Karras to fall directly down.

Many Georgetown locations, on and off-campus, were used. Burstyn&#x27;s first scene, where she lectures the protesters, was shot on the steps of Healy Hall; she is also seen walking down the steps of Lauinger Library. Other scenes used the interiors of Dahlgren Chapel and the university president&#x27;s office, used as the archbishop&#x27;s office. One scene was filmed in The Tombs, a popular local pub.

====Exorcism scenes====
The exorcism scenes were challenging to film. Friedkin wanted the bedroom set to be cold enough to see the actors&#x27; breath, as described in the novel. A $50,000 ($ in ) refrigeration system was installed to cool the set to . Since the set lighting warmed the air, it remained cold enough to film for only three minutes at a time. Due to frequent breakdowns, only five shots could be finished each day; the complete scene, filmed in script order, took a month to complete.

It was easier to film some of the other supernatural manifestations, such as the bed rocking and the curtains blowing since the walls and ceiling of the set were capable of being moved to accommodate a camera. After the scene where the ceiling cracks it was replaced with one attached to the walls, requiring a hole be cut in it for the rig to go through when Regan levitates, the most challenging shot in the sequence. The Blair wore a bodysuit under her nightgown with attached hooks for monofilament wires.

Roizman had filmed similar scenes before, painting the wires to match the background so they would not show. This was difficult on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; because of the changes in background. &quot;We had to practically paint them frame by frame&quot;, he said. While most directors would have been satisfied to smooth out the scene in post-production, Friedkin wanted it done in longer takes.

Friedkin did not want any scenes in the movie to have &quot;any kind of spooky lights that you typically saw in horror films&quot;, so all the light in the bedroom comes from a visible source. The room&#x27;s color scheme also suggested black and white film, with gray taupe walls, Regan&#x27;s bedding a neutral beige, and the priests in black. According to Roizman, white would have been too dominant. &quot;In toning everything down like this, the only real color in the room became the skin tones&quot;, he said.

====Father Merrin&#x27;s arrival scene====
Father Merrin&#x27;s arrival scene was filmed on Max von Sydow&#x27;s first day on set. The scene where he steps out of a cab and stands in front of the MacNeil residence, silhouetted in a misty streetlamp&#x27;s glow and staring up at a beam of light from a bedroom window, is one of the most famous scenes in the movie, used for film posters and home media release covers. It was inspired by René Magritte&#x27;s 1954 painting &quot;Empire of Light&quot;. Friedkin wanted to evoke visually the language Blatty used in the novel for this scene, likening Merrin to &quot;a melancholy traveler frozen in time&quot;, standing next to a streetlight in the fog when he gets out of the cab.

He gave the crew a full day to light the scene, using mainly arc lights and tripod-mounted Troupers, and boosting the brightness of the existing streetlamps. Roizman said this was the most difficult of all the film&#x27;s nighttime exterior shots. To get the beam of light the way Friedkin wanted it, the crew had to take the window frame out of the facade they had attached to the house for filming, put it behind the window and then put the spotlight in between the window and frame. As they were shooting, Roizman said, the wind picked up, making it hard to hold the fog effect. By working quickly, he and the camera crew were able to get the shot, with Friedkin finding the first take satisfactory.

====Head spinning====

The scenes where the possessed Regan&#x27;s head rotates so she appears to be looking directly backward drew notice from audiences and critics. &quot;All I can tell you is that the way you think I did it is not the way we did it,&quot; Friedkin told &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot; at the time. Like the film&#x27;s other special effects, it was performed live. A life-size animated dummy of Regan was built.

Critic Mark Kermode says the scene&#x27;s impact results from the audience not expecting it so soon after the crucifix scene. He believes its recurrence during the exorcism was added on set since it is in neither the novel nor the screenplay. Blatty had argued against it, telling Friedkin &quot;supernatural doesn&#x27;t mean impossible&quot;. Friedkin inserted a shot of Karras, suggesting the scene might just be a hallucination. When audiences reacted strongly, Blatty said Friedkin &quot;prov[ed] me an idiot once again.&quot;

Special effects supervisor Marcel Vercoutere built the latex dummy with help from makeup artist Dick Smith. They tested its realism by putting it in the front seat of a taxicab and, when enough people were looking, turning the head. It was so realistic that Blair felt uncomfortable in its presence. They had given the dummy&#x27;s face the capability to move and appear to speak, adding a condom so its throat would bulge. A tube was added for simulated breathing, which produced the requisite clouds of vapor.

====Crucifix scene====
While filming the scene where the possessed Regan masturbates with a crucifix, Dietz and Friedkin had &quot;this long discussion about the right way to jerk off and I showed him why a woman has to churn her wrist [more than a man does].&quot; At the time Friedkin said that the scene&#x27;s power over audiences came from its unusual combination of sex and religion. To many viewers it lasted much longer than its 50 seconds. He had filmed much more, but ultimately decided that it was about &quot;how much I could take&quot;.

The scene&#x27;s power, Kermode writes, comes from Friedkin&#x27;s head-on approach, centering it on a brightly lit screen, punctuating the thrusts with a stabbing sound. Blatty pleaded with Friedkin to stop &quot;destroying the film&quot;; Friedkin responded that the scene would be one of the film&#x27;s biggest draws. When it turned out that it was, Blatty found it &quot;terribly depressing.&quot;

====Angiography scene====

The angiography scene, in which a needle spurts blood from Regan&#x27;s neck, caused audiences the most discomfort, according to Blatty, who himself never watched it. Friedkin, too, has found its depiction of &quot;[m]edical science impinging upon the innocence of this little girl&quot; disturbs audiences the most, more than any of the film&#x27;s possession scenes. It has been criticized as &quot;unappetizing&quot;, the film&#x27;s &quot;most needless scene&quot;, and &quot;revolting&quot;. British comedian Graeme Garden, who has a medical degree, agreed the scene was &quot;genuinely disturbing&quot;; in his review for the &quot;New Scientist&quot;, he called it &quot;irresponsible&quot;.

Critic John Kenneth Muir wrote in &quot;Horror Films of the 1970s&quot; that the scene draws its power by merely recording what occurs and not adding anything. &quot;It looks, sounds and feels totally real ... For a time, it is medicine that possesses Regan, not the Devil&quot;. In a 2021 article in &quot;History of the Human Sciences&quot;, Amy C. Chambers of Manchester Metropolitan University makes a similar observation. 
Finnish media professor Frans Ilkka Mäyrä notes how the scientific suggests the spiritual here as &quot;the violent movements and noises of arteriographic machinery reach diabolical dimensions.&quot; Kermode likens it to torture, &quot;horribly sexual in its execution.&quot;

Medical professionals have described the scene, not in the novel but added to the film to reflect changes in technology, as a realistic depiction of the procedure. It is also of historical interest, as radiologists were increasingly using a more distant artery instead of the carotid for the puncture. It has also been described as the most realistic depiction of a medical procedure in a popular film. In his 2012 commentary on the DVD release of the 2000 cut, Friedkin claimed that the scene was used in radiological training film for years afterward.

====&quot;Spider-walk&quot; scene====
Stuntwoman Ann Miles performed the spider-walk scene after two weeks of practice. Special effects supervisor Marcel Vercoutere had designed a special harness, but Miles did not need it due to her college gymnastic experience. Over Blatty&#x27;s objection, Friedkin cut the scene just prior to the premiere, believing it came too early in the film. Whether the scene had been shot at all was debated by fans for years afterwards. Friedkin denied having done so until Kermode found the footage in the Warner Bros. archives in the mid-1990s while researching his book on the film. It was restored in the 2000 director&#x27;s cut, albeit with a &quot;muddy, grainy&quot; look that one critic said made the scene seem superfluous, using an added shot showing Regan with blood flowing from her mouth.

Miles was not credited. Websites devoted to the film in the early 21st century gave credit to Sylvia Hager after the 2000 re-release. This confusion may have arisen from Vercourtere&#x27;s website, where he credited her and described the harness he had designed. He said the scene was cut because the harness could not be erased in post-production. According to Miles, Hager, her lighting double, could not do the scene even with the harness, which Vercourtere had hoped to market afterwards. Since Miles was able to do the spider walk without it, she believes he left her out of his account for commercial reasons. The misidentification, Miles said in 2018, cost her jobs afterwards since some producers believed she was falsely taking credit for Hager&#x27;s work. Since then, with the intercession of SAG, she has been properly credited.

====Special effects====
Smith, the makeup artist, created some key special effects, particularly to make von Sydow look 30 years older in facial close-ups. Many viewers did not realize he was made up at all; critic Pauline Kael, in her generally unfavorable &quot;The New Yorker&quot; review, called it &quot;one of the most convincing aging jobs I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; It took four hours to apply the makeup every morning. Friedkin speculated that if there was a regular Academy Award for makeup, Smith would have received it.

For the look of the possessed Regan, Friedkin and Smith drew inspiration from the crucifix scene. If she had injured herself masturbating with it, they reasoned, it was likely that under Pazuzu&#x27;s control she might also have deliberately scourged her face. &quot;[So we] decided to have the makeup grow out of self-inflicted wounds to the face that become gangrenous so that there was an organic reason for the change in her facial features, which might certainly be demonic possession, or self-immolation&quot;, Friedkin later explained. Blair wore green contact lenses meant to give her eyes a bestial appearance. A latex stomach was built for the scene where the words &quot;HELP ME&quot; appear on the possessed Regan&#x27;s body. The letters were scratched in, and then heated to make them disappear. This was reversed in post-production so the letters seemed to appear.

===Production difficulties and purported curse===
Due to production problems and accidents on set, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, originally scheduled for 85 days of principal photography, took over 200 days to wrap. The film went $2.5 million ($ in ) over budget, ultimately costing the studio $12 million ($ in ). Early on, shooting was delayed six weeks after a bird flew into a circuit breaker on the house sets, starting a fire that destroyed all of them except for Regan&#x27;s room. Later, another set was severely damaged by the sprinkler system. The statue of Pazuzu was shipped to Hong Kong instead of Iraq, causing a two-week delay.

Injuries to cast and crew also affected production. Burstyn and Blair have lasting consequences from back injuries. Burstyn&#x27;s occurred during the scene where the possessed Regan throws Chris backward; the take used in the film left her unable to film for two weeks and on crutches for the rest of the shoot, with a fractured coccyx. It has caused her chronic problems due to inadequate early treatment. Blair fractured her lower spine after being too loosely strapped to the rocking bed, a take also used in the finished film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair /Film story&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She developed scoliosis, with long-term health effects, as well as a lifelong aversion to cold from all her time in the refrigerated bedroom set wearing only a nightgown and long underwear. A carpenter cut his thumb off and a lighting technician lost a toe in different accidents.

Other people connected with the film, or their family members, died—MacGowran a week after completing his scenes as Dennings. Maliaros (Mrs.Karras) also died, like her character, before the film was finished. Deaths among the crew or those close to them included the night watchman, the operator of the refrigeration system for Regan&#x27;s room and an assistant cameraman&#x27;s newborn. Blair&#x27;s grandfather died during the first week of production, and von Sydow had to return to Sweden after his first day shooting when his brother died, further delaying shooting. One of Miller&#x27;s sons nearly died when a motorcycle struck him. Several years after the film&#x27;s release, Paul Bateson, the technician in the angiography scene, was convicted of murdering journalist Addison Verrill. In 2015, Hatra, the World Heritage Site where the prologue was shot, was damaged by ISIL militants.

Friedkin believed there might have been some supernatural interference. &quot;I&#x27;m not a convert to the occult&quot;, he told the horror-film magazine, &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;but after all I&#x27;ve seen on this film, I definitely believe in demonic possession ... We were plagued by strange and sinister things from the beginning.&quot; Vercourtere said he &quot;felt I was playing around with something I shouldn&#x27;t be playing around with.&quot; To mollify the crew, Friedkin asked Father Bermingham, the film&#x27;s technical advisor, to perform an exorcism on the set. Bermingham instead blessed the cast and crew, believing that an actual exorcism would only make the cast more anxious.

British film historian Sarah Crowther believes stories of the curse were disseminated by the studio, likening it to horror producer William Castle&#x27;s elaborate marketing gimmicks. She believes most of the aspects of the curse are really just the result of Friedkin&#x27;s driving, relentless production. Blatty agreed, telling Kermode that Friedkin had started the &quot;curse&quot; story with an interview during production in which he blamed &quot;devils&quot; for the film&#x27;s many delays. &quot;[I]f you shoot something for a year,&quot; Blatty said, &quot;people are going to get hurt, people are going to die.&quot; Blair told Kermode that stories of the supposed curse circulated because viewers &quot;chose to see a scary film, and maybe they wanted to believe all those rumors because it helped the whole process&quot;, she said. In 2000, Blatty joked that &quot;There is no &quot;Exorcist&quot; curse. &quot;I&quot; am &quot;The Exorcist&quot; curse!&quot; when asked if the death of Blair&#x27;s pet mouse was related to it.

==Post-production==
===Editing===
During principal photography, the editor then hired had no prior movie experience and was not allowed to cut the raw footage. Friedkin hired three editors—Jordan Leondopoulos, credited as &quot;supervising editor&quot;; Norman Gay, and Evan Lottman. A fourth, Bud Smith, recalls Friedkin asking him to work on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; after shooting wrapped, telling Smith he would be the lead. Smith asked Friedkin to let him edit one large rack of footage from the Iraq sequence and worked through a weekend to recut it to a rhythm based on the sound of a blacksmith hammering an anvil near Merrin. He also created the &quot;flash face&quot; trailer for the film, with a montage of faces making a strobe-like effect, under tense string music, ending after almost 90 seconds with the title. In 2018, Friedkin said that Warner Bros. feared it would scare audiences too much. He considers it the film&#x27;s best trailer. Smith and the other three shared the film&#x27;s Academy Award nomination for editing.

Friedkin felt the 140-minute-long cut was perfect, but the studio insisted he trim it to two hours to allow for more daily screenings. Blatty was willing to fight for the whole film as it was, but over his objections Friedkin cut roughly 10–12 minutes. Some of the excluded scenes were Blatty&#x27;s favorites, including the original ending, with Dyer and Kinderman connecting and agreeing to go to the movies in the future, and a scene where Karras and Merrin take a break from the exorcism and discuss the demon&#x27;s motivation for possessing Regan. These scenes had been in the novel, and he believed that in the movie they made it clearer at the end that good had triumphed.

===Sound effects===
Ron Nagle, Doc Siegel, Gonzalo Gavira, and Bob Fine created the sound effects, mixing bees, dogs, hamsters, and pigs into the demon&#x27;s voice. The sound of Regan&#x27;s head rotating was made by twisting a leather wallet.

Friedkin was personally involved in the four-month sound process, the last aspect of the film completed, finished just before release. Jim Nelson, whom Friedkin had hired to supervise the mixing, recalls the director being particularly demanding, treating his then-girlfriend, who was among those assisting in the process, &quot;like a dog&quot;.

===Alleged subliminal imagery===
Wilson Bryan Key devoted a chapter to the film in his book &quot;Media Sexploitation&quot;, alleging repeated use of subliminal and semi-subliminal imagery and sound effects. In addition to the Pazuzu face, he claimed that the safety padding on the bedposts was shaped to cast phallic shadows on the wall and that a skull face is superimposed into one of Father Merrin&#x27;s breath clouds.

A 1991 &quot;Video Watchdog&quot; article examined the claim, with stills of several uses of subliminal &quot;flashing&quot;. &quot;I saw subliminal cuts in a number of films before I ever put them in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;,&quot; Friedkin told the authors, &quot;and I thought it was a very effective storytelling device ... The subliminal editing in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was done for &quot;dramatic&quot; effect—to create, achieve, and sustain a kind of dreamlike state.&quot; In a 1999 interview, Blatty said &quot;[t]here are no subliminal images. If you can see it, it&#x27;s not subliminal.&quot;

===Title sequence===
The title sequence was the first major project for film title designer Dan Perri, whom Friedkin sought out after seeing his work on &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot;. His plan for the titles evolved as the film progressed. For the words themselves Perri chose to keep the Weiss Initials typeface used on the cover of Blatty&#x27;s novel. The filmmakers wanted them in red, but it was hard to choose an exact shade since red tends to spill on a black background.

Perri&#x27;s input into the film&#x27;s opening extended beyond the credits. Friedkin told him he wanted the film to begin with a sunrise, which he had not filmed while there. The closest shot he had was one at midday, of the sun in an orange sky, with rising heat visible. Perri suggested an &quot;implied sunrise&quot;, fading in on the sun and going from black and white to color over 30 seconds, giving the film a sense of beginning it had lacked, he said.

===Music===
Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; became very popular after its use in the film. Friedkin recalled in 2015 that he had wanted something like Brahms&#x27; &quot;Lullaby&quot; with &quot;a kind of childhood feel&quot;. He had gone to see studio head John Calley, who directed him to the company&#x27;s nearby music library. There he found Oldfield&#x27;s record and persuaded the company to buy the rights.

Lalo Schifrin said that after he had written six minutes of music for the &quot;flash face&quot; and a working score, trailer executives told Friedkin they wanted softer music but Friedkin never told him; Friedkin rejected the score. In 2005 Schifrin said this was in retaliation for an earlier &quot;incident&quot; between the two. Schifrin denies claims he used his original &quot;Exorcist&quot; music several years later for &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;. Friedkin threw away the tapes of Schifrin&#x27;s score in the studio parking lot. In an interview shortly after the film&#x27;s release, Friedkin said he had hired an unnamed composer &quot;and he did a score all right, and I thought it was terrible, just overstated and dreadful.&quot; He decided instead to use the music he had given the composer as inspiration. Bernard Herrmann turned down the job after viewing a rough cut. In 1975, Herrmann said that Friedkin objected to his intention to use an organ and insisted on sharing composing credit.

Friedkin ultimately used modern classical compositions, including portions of the 1972 Cello Concerto No. 1 and &quot;Polymorphia&quot;, among other pieces by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki; &quot;Five Pieces for Orchestra&quot; by Austrian composer Anton Webern, and original music by Jack Nitzsche, all heard only during scene transitions. There are only 17 minutes of music in the two-hour film. &quot;What I &quot;wanted&quot;&quot;, Friedkin said, &quot;what I think we have in the film, is understated music. The music is just a presence like a cold hand on the back of your neck, rather than assertive&quot;, an aspect praised by Judith Crist. The Greek song on the radio as Father Karras leaves his mother&#x27;s house is &quot;Paramythaki mou&quot; (My Tale), sung by Giannis Kalatzis. Part of Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s 1966 composition &quot;Fantasia for Strings&quot; is played over the closing credits.

In 1998, a restored and remastered soundtrack was released (without &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;) with three pieces from Schifrin&#x27;s rejected score: &quot;Music from the unused Trailer&quot;, an 11-minute &quot;Suite from the Unused Score&quot;, and &quot;Rock Ballad (Unused Theme)&quot;. That same year, the Japanese version of the original soundtrack LP omitted the Schifrin pieces but restored the main theme, and the &quot;Night of the Electric Insects&quot; movement from George Crumb&#x27;s string quartet &quot;Black Angels&quot;. The 2000 cut features new music by Steve Boeddeker, as well as brief source music by Les Baxter. Waxwork Records released the remastered score in 2017. They included Friedkin&#x27;s liner notes with art by Justin Erickson of Phantom City Creative.

==Releases==
===Theatrical===
Warner Bros. scheduled &quot;The Exorcist&quot; for release on December 26, 1973. It had been scheduled for an earlier release, but was postponed due to post-production delays. Friedkin was angry about this, believing that it hurt the film commercially. He had wanted a release &quot;before&quot; or on the holiday. It has been speculated that the studio wanted to avoid any controversy that might have come from releasing a film about demonic possession before a major religious holiday. Crowther, conversely, believes the studio chose Christmas to stoke controversy around the film. Friedkin supposedly had seen what Paramount had done to make &quot;The Godfather&quot; a runaway success after its own troubled production. He had wanted the studio to choose a more favorable release date, such as March, like &quot;Godfather&quot;.

The post-holiday release served to help &quot;The Exorcist&quot; sell tickets, as most moviegoers had time off. It was the highest-grossing Christmas week release after 1997&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot;, and is still in second place. &quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s first run lasted 105 weeks, or just over two years. In 1979, the film was re-released in 70mm, with its original 1.75:1 aspect ratio expanded to 2.20:1. A longer cut, subtitled &quot;The Version You&#x27;ve Never Seen&quot;, (later re-labeled &quot;Extended Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;) was released theatrically in 2000, with additions and changes.

===Home media===
A 25th anniversary special edition box set was released in 1998 on VHS and DVD, with the original ending as a special feature. Blatty was pleased that the scene was restored, saying it was &quot;the way it ought to be seen.&quot;

&quot;The Version You&#x27;ve Never Seen&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in 2000. It was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray with slight alterations as the &quot;Extended Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; in 2010; the Blu-Ray featured a restored version of both cuts. A 40th-anniversary Blu-ray was released in 2013, with both cuts, many previously released bonus features and two featurettes about Blatty. &quot;The Exorcist: The Complete Anthology&quot;, a box set, was released on DVD in 2006, and on Blu-ray in 2014. It includes both cuts, the sequels &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist III&quot;, and the prequels &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Both the theatrical and extended versions of the film were released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on September 19, 2023, to mark the film&#x27;s 50th Anniversary.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Warner Bros. initially had low expectations for &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, since it was a horror film without major stars that had gone well over budget. The film was not previewed for critics and initially booked for 30 screens in 24 theaters, mostly in large cities and metropolitan areas. The film grossed $1.9 million ($ in ) in its first week, setting records for each theater it was booked in, with an average of $70,000, equivalent to $ in . Within its first month, it had grossed $7.4 million ($ in ) nationwide; studio executives expected it to surpass &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; as the studio&#x27;s most financially successful film. The huge crowds forced the studio to expand to a 366-screen wide release very quickly. At the time that releasing strategy had rarely been used for anything but exploitation films. Many theaters in large cities were not located near downtowns, where Warner Bros. had booked the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; sequel &quot;Magnum Force&quot; before planning the release of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. By February, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; accounted for 15 percent of the distributor&#x27;s grosses in key markets.

None of the theaters booked for the initial release were in Black neighborhoods such as South Central Los Angeles, since the studio did not expect that audience to be interested in the film, which had no Black characters. After the theater in predominantly White Westwood showing the film was overwhelmed with moviegoers from South Central, it was booked into theaters there. Black enthusiasm for &quot;The Exorcist&quot; has been credited with ending mainstream studio support for blaxploitation movies, since Hollywood realized that Black audiences did not show any preference for them. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the audience lined up to see the film was between one-quarter and one-third Black at a theater on the mostly White Upper East Side of Manhattan showing the film. One Black patron said, when asked why that might be, that they &quot;relate to voodoo and witchcraft and that kind of devil stuff ... Many still believe in black magic, especially those from Haiti and the Deep South.&quot;

&quot;The Exorcist&quot; earned $66.3 million ($ in ) in distributors&#x27; rentals during its theatrical release in 1974 in the United States and Canada, becoming the second most popular film of that year (behind &quot;The Sting&quot;″s $68.5 million) and Warner Bros.&#x27; highest-grossing film of all time although it eventually became the highest-grossing 1973 release. Warner Bros. retained more of that money than usual since it released the film under four-wall distribution, the first time a major studio had done that. Under that arrangement the studio rents the theater from the owner in the initial run and keeps all the ticket revenue. Warner Bros. also did some things that had made &quot;The Godfather&quot; successful for Paramount, such as making theaters commit to showing the film for at least 24 weeks. Overseas, the film earned rentals of $46 million for a worldwide total of $112.3 million ($ in ). It became the highest-grossing film in Japan with rentals of over $8.2 million in its first 11 weeks. After several reissues, the film has grossed $232.6 million in the United States and Canada, which adjusted for inflation, makes it the ninth highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. and Canada and the top-grossing R-rated film of all time. , it has grossed $441 million worldwide, ($ in ).

===Initial critical response===
Upon release the film received mixed critical reviews. Stanley Kauffmann, in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, wrote, &quot;This is the scariest film I&#x27;ve seen in years—the &quot;only&quot; scary film I&#x27;ve seen in years&quot;. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; noted that it was &quot;an expert telling of a supernatural horror story&quot;. In the horror-film magazine &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot;, Joe Dante, later director of &quot;Piranha&quot; and &quot;The Howling&quot;, called it &quot;an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic ... there has never been anything like this on the screen before&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the special effects, but concluded: &quot;I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won&#x27;t be one ... Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?&quot;

In the middle of the range was Judith Crist. Her &quot;New York&quot; review called the film &quot;half-successful&quot;. She praised Friedkin&#x27;s direction, its &quot;to-the-point performances&quot; and the special effects and makeup. But she felt that Blatty had left out what made readers connect with characters in the novel; he was also perhaps limited since the film could not leave things to the imagination as his book had. Kael called the film &quot;shallowness that asks to be taken seriously&quot; saying its main problem was being too faithful to the novel as Blatty had intended it. Vincent Canby, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, dismissed &quot;The Exorcist&quot; as &quot;a chunk of elegant occultist claptrap ... a practically impossible film to sit through ... [e]stablish[ing] a new low for grotesque special effects.&quot; Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; complained that &quot;Friedkin&#x27;s biggest weakness is his inability to provide enough visual information about his characters ... &quot;The Exorcist&quot; succeeds on one level as an effectively excruciating entertainment, but on another, deeper level it is a thoroughly evil film&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jon Landau called &quot;The Exorcist&quot; &quot;nothing more than a religious porn film, the gaudiest piece of shlock this side of Cecil B. DeMille.&quot; &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;″s Michael Dempsey called &quot;The Exorcist&quot; &quot;the trash bombshell of 1973, the aesthetic equivalent of being run over by a truck ... a gloating, ugly exploitation picture.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Bay Guardian&quot;″s reviewer called it &quot;quite simply the dumbest, most insultingly anti-intellectual movie I have ever come across&quot;.

===Audience reaction===
Audience members screamed and fled the theater during the only sneak preview. When it was over, studio head John Calley and the other executives were stunned, but they noticed that everyone who saw it was still outside the theater talking about it. They believed the film was brilliant, but did not know how to market it, and decided on the limited early release after Christmas. Burstyn recalled watching a television news report showing moviegoers in Montreal lining up during the dead of winter at 4a.m. in frigid weather the morning the film opened. Despite its mixed reviews and the controversies over its content and viewer reaction, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was a runaway hit. In New York City, patrons endured cold, rain, and sleet in long lines during a normally slow time of year for the movies to buy tickets, even after having seen it once. Crowds outside theaters sometimes rioted. &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked some of those in line what drew them there. Those who had read the novel accounted for about a third; they wanted to see if the film could realistically depict some of the scenes in the book. Another &quot;wanted to be part of the madness&quot;. A repeat viewer told the newspaper that the film was &quot;better than &quot;Psycho&quot;&quot;, making him feel &quot;contaminated&quot;. Many had never waited in line that long for a movie before, or not in a long time.

Reports of strong audience reactions were widespread. Many viewers fainted; a woman in New York was said to have miscarried during a showing. One man was carried out on a stretcher after 20 minutes. Nausea was frequent; a &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; reviewer recalled how the vomit in the bathroom blocked access to the sinks. &quot;We have a plumber practically living here now&quot;, said the manager of Toronto&#x27;s University Theater, which sold out its four daily showings. Viewers seemed particularly disturbed by the crucifix scenes. Some theaters arranged for ambulances to be on call. Many audience members found the angiography to be the film&#x27;s most unsettling scene. Some Catholic viewers, particularly those who had lapsed in their faith but also including some priests, experienced spiritual crises. Many parishes reported callers inquiring about having an exorcism performed. The Rev. Richard Woods, a professor at Loyola of Chicago, said most of his calls were from lapsed Catholics for whom the film resurfaced their religious education prior to Vatican II. &quot;It stirs up memories of all those descriptions of hell that you got from nuns,&quot; he said.

In 1975, &quot;The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease&quot; published a paper by a psychiatrist documenting four cases of &quot;cinematic neurosis&quot; triggered by the film. In all he believed scenes depicting Regan&#x27;s possession had surfaced a latent condition. He recommended physicians view the movie with the patient to help identify the sources of their trauma. Other external causes were suggested. One writer at &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot; took note of Friedkin&#x27;s pride in the movie&#x27;s sound, which theaters played at maximum volume, and wondered if its low frequencies had induced or amplified patrons&#x27; anxiety. Another writer there blamed the reactions on the mainstream audience&#x27;s general unfamiliarity with horror-movie conventions, speculating that &quot;these people hadn&#x27;t gone to see a monster movie since 1935.&quot;

&quot;&quot;The Exorcist&quot; ... was one of the rare horror movies that became part of the national conversation&quot;, wrote Zinoman four decades later: &quot;It was a movie you needed to have an opinion about&quot;. Journalists complained that coverage of the film was distracting the public from the ongoing Watergate scandal. Much of that coverage focused on the audience which, film historian William Paul wrote, &quot;had become a spectacle equal to the film&quot;. He did not think any other film&#x27;s audience received as much coverage as &quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s.

===Religious response===
&quot;One of the best things that could happen is if the Pope denounces it&quot;, Friedkin said. The crucifix scene, and others, involved material sacrilegious to Catholics. Officially the Church, whose influence over film content had declined following the demise of the Hays Office and the associated Production Code a few years earlier, had bemoaned Warner Bros.&#x27; choice of release date. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops&#x27; Office for Film and Broadcasting&#x27;s &quot;Catholic Film Newsletter&quot; rated the film suitable for adults with reservations, and gave it a generally negative review that faulted the film for suggesting exorcisms were common and possibly encouraging belief in the occult and Satanism.

Individual priests familiar with the theology were also critical. One who, like Karras, was a Jesuit and psychiatrist at Georgetown said that while he believed in the Devil, &quot;there is no shred of evidence from the Bible that he can possess an individual.&quot; Woods, the Loyola of Chicago professor, who had written a book about the Devil, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Karras and Merrin were incompetent. &quot;They departed from the ritual in the most stupid and reckless manner,&quot; he said. &quot;They tried to fight the Demon hand to hand instead of relying on the power of God.&quot; Eugene Kennedy, another Loyola priest and psychologist, described the film&#x27;s view of the battle of good and evil as &quot;immature  ... Being a Christian and a mature person means coming to terms with our own capacity for evil, not projecting it on an outside force that possesses us.&quot;

Some non-Catholics were critical. &quot;Surely it is the religious people who should be most offended by this movie&quot;, wrote Kael, incredulous that Georgetown and several priests facilitated the production:

Kael nonetheless described &quot;The Exorcist&quot; as &quot;the biggest recruiting poster the Catholic Church has had since the sunnier days of &quot;Going My Way&quot; and &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;&quot; since the film &quot;says that [it] is the true faith, feared by the Devil, and that its rituals can exorcise demons.&quot; A later historian has found that the Church was not as critical of the film as reports suggested, privately considering it faith-affirming. Authorities in predominantly Muslim Tunisia banned the film before its 1975 release there as &quot;unjustified propaganda in favor of Christianity&quot;. In 2008, Colleen McDannell, editor of &quot;Catholics in the Movies&quot;, wrote that &quot;&quot;The Exorcist&quot; is a horror movie that believes in its villain and, even worse, recruits its villain as a witness to Catholic truth.&quot;

In February 1974, the Jesuit magazine &quot;America&quot; ran several commentaries and responses by priests to the film. The editors allowed Blatty to respond later that month. He praised some of the commentators&#x27; points, but was disappointed by some misconceptions of the film held by both critics and defenders. The changes to the film&#x27;s ending from the novel, Blatty agreed, might have made it harder to perceive that &quot;the mystery of goodness&quot; was the theme of the work. It appeared to him that for many viewers, including some of the &quot;America&quot; writers, the film ended with the demon triumphant through the deaths of the priests despite being exorcised from Regan. The ending of the novel made this clearer, but even in the film he saw Karras&#x27;s suicide as a sacrificial act of love that reaffirmed his faith.

American Protestant groups also took critical note of the &quot;Exorcist&quot; phenomenon and its religious implications. Evangelist Billy Graham told the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; that &quot;the Devil is in every frame of that film&quot;, a remark later characterized as Graham believing the print itself was possessed. The Rev. Lester Kinsolving, an Episcopal priest and syndicated newspaper columnist argued the Church approved the film only because its heroes were priests. &quot;The Christian Century&quot;, the leading voice of mainline Protestantism, likewise denounced the film as &quot;hardcore pornography [that to Protestants offers] a completely impossible solution&quot; to evil. Protestant groups around the country picketed the film and offered support to those who might be disturbed by it.

===Rating controversy===
The Motion Picture Association of America&#x27;s (MPAA) ratings board had been established several years before to replace the Production Code. It had already been criticized for its indirect censorship; reportedly almost a third of the films submitted had been recut to avoid an X rating, which barred admission to minors. Since many theaters did not show those films and newspapers did not run ads for them, the X rating greatly limited a non-pornographic film&#x27;s commercial prospects. While Friedkin wanted more blood and gore in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; than any Hollywood film before, he also needed the R rating. Before release, Aaron Stern, the head of the MPAA ratings board, watched the film himself. He told Friedkin that &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was &quot;an important film&quot; which would receive an R rating as submitted.

Some critics, reacting to reports of the film&#x27;s effect on children who had seen it, questioned the R rating. In February 1974, Roy Meacham, a television critic in Washington, D.C., who had praised the film, wrote that he had heard of a girl being taken from the theater in an ambulance, even though his station regularly warned against letting children see it. Meacham said that the children saw leaving showings &quot;were drained and drawn afterward; their eyes had a look I had never seen before.&quot; He suggested that the MPAA had yielded to pressure from Warner Bros., and doubted MPAA head Jack Valenti&#x27;s claims that the R rating was justified in the absence of sex or nudity. After a week in Washington&#x27;s theaters, Meacham recalled, authorities cited the crucifix scene to invoke a local ordinance that forbade minors from seeing any scenes with sexual content, even where the actors were fully clothed. Police warned theaters that staff would be arrested if &quot;any&quot; minors were admitted to see &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. There were also reports of theaters not strictly enforcing the R rating. Meacham wrote that the board had lost its moral authority, and feared communities across the country would pass their own, perhaps more restrictive laws on what could be shown. Kael echoed his insinuations that the board had yielded to studio pressure due to the film&#x27;s cost. Ebert, who had favorably reviewed the film, found the special effects unusually graphic, making it &quot;stupefying&quot; that it had been rated R. Stern&#x27;s successor as ratings board chair, Richard Heffner, said of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;: &quot;How could anything be worse than this? And it got an R?&quot;

Boston and Hattiesburg, Mississippi, attempted to prevent showings. A court in the former city blocked the ban, saying the film did not meet the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s standard of obscenity. Authorities there still told theaters not to admit minors. In Mississippi, police arrested the projectionist and manager after the film&#x27;s first showing; a jury convicted the theater of obscenity and fined it $100. The Mississippi Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1976, holding the state&#x27;s obscenity statute too vague to be enforceable under the 1972 &quot;Miller v. California&quot; decision.

===Viewing restrictions in United Kingdom===
Upon its United Kingdom release in March 1974, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; drew protests around Britain from the Nationwide Festival of Light (NFL), a Christian public action group. Local clergy and concerned citizens handed out leaflets offering spiritual support afterwards to those queuing for the film. A letter-writing campaign to local councils by the NFL led many of them to screen &quot;The Exorcist&quot; before permitting showings. It was thus banned in some areas, such as Dinefwr Borough (now Carmarthenshire) and Ceredigion in Wales.

In 1981, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was released on home video in the UK. After the passage of the Video Recordings Act 1984, it was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for a home video certificate. A majority voted to grant it, but director James Ferman vetoed them. He believed that, even with a proposed 18 certificate, the film&#x27;s notoriety would lead underage viewers to seek it out. As a result, all UK video copies of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; were withdrawn in 1988. Following a successful theatrical re-release in 1998, the film was submitted for home video release again in 1999. It was passed uncut with an 18 certificate, signifying a relaxation of the censorship rules for home video in the UK. In 2001, Channel 4 showed &quot;The Exorcist&quot; on UK broadcast television for the first time.

===After release===
&quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s box office records stood for years. It was the top-grossing R-rated horror film for almost half a century. In 1999, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; beat the film as the highest-grossing supernatural horror film until &quot;It&quot; took that honor in 2017. On both charts, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, along with &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, are the only 20th-century releases in the top ten.

Since its release, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s critical reputation has grown. The director&#x27;s cut received an 88% rating from the same site, with a 7.30 rating, based on 82 reviews, while its consensus reading &quot;&quot;The Exorcist&quot; has withstood the test of time, and it still has that renegade feel and the power to shock.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film critic Gene Siskel named it one of the top five films of 1973. The English film critic Mark Kermode believes &quot;The Exorcist&quot; to be the best film ever made.

Director Martin Scorsese put &quot;The Exorcist&quot; on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Other filmmakers, including Stanley Kubrick, Robert Eggers, Alex Proyas and David Fincher, have cited &quot;The Exorcist&quot; as a favorite. In 2008, it was named one of &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Movies Ever Made&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; put it on a similar list of a thousand films. John Carpenter listed &quot;The Exorcist&quot; as one of his top eight scariest horror classics, and said it influenced his 1980 film &quot;The Fog&quot;.

Some critics wondered, in advance of its 2000 re-release, whether &quot;The Exorcist&quot; would affect contemporary audiences, since it had been so widely imitated and emulated. The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;″s Malcolm Johnson described it as a &quot;little old hat in 2000.&quot; Some scenes, such as Ritalin being proposed as a treatment for Regan, provoked unintended laughter. But the film&#x27;s performances were still effective, and the longer version made the medical professionals seem like &quot;witch doctors&quot;. The &quot;Tribune&quot; found it &quot;a deeper movie now.&quot; Friedkin, an odd choice to direct at the time, now proved the best for critic Michael Wilmington, as he knew &quot;how to convey a convincing atmosphere of modern chaos and dread.&quot;

==Themes==
Critics and scholars attributed &quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s box office success to social anxiety following the cultural, political and social upheavals of the late 1960s. &quot;&quot;The Exorcist&quot; communicates an image of a United States in an unstable state of change that can no longer avoid its real and historical systemic evils&quot;, writes Amy Chambers. Kermode noted that by stylistically distancing itself from the more Gothic horror films of the 1960s, the film &quot;presented a credible portrait of the modern urban world ripped apart by an obscene, ancient evil.&quot; Stephen King calls &quot;The Exorcist&quot; &quot;a social horror film if there ever was one&quot; in his 1983 treatise on the genre, &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;. He sees the possessed Regan symbolizing for middle-aged viewers the outspoken youth protesting the Vietnam War; Danny Peary likewise notes the symbolic and real fragmentation throughout the film: &quot;With the world in such disorder, the Devil can make a dramatic entrance.&quot;

At the time of the film&#x27;s release, the Watergate scandal was worsening, implicating President Richard Nixon. In 2019, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Tom Breihan said that &quot;the spectacle of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; might&#x27;ve mirrored&quot; Watergate. In a &quot;Christian Century&quot; article, theologian Carl Raschke connected the &quot;psychodramas of the American soul&quot; resulting from &quot;the cynical mood of our age [arising] by default from the wreck of traditional religious as well as social values.&quot; Breihan reads the film itself as reactionary, &quot;built on reverence of tradition&quot; despite its surface transgressiveness. &quot;[It] almost sneers at the politics of the ’60s&quot;, he writes, noting Chris dismissing her film&#x27;s take on student protest as &quot;the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story&quot;. In the only scene she is shown shooting, her character, a faculty member at the fictional college, counsels a group of protesters that change can only come from the system.

Feminism has figured in discussions of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. At the time, the U.S. women&#x27;s liberation movement had enjoyed some early gains in legislatures and courts. Commentators have seen the film&#x27;s depiction of a single working mother and her uncontrollable daughter who are rescued by patriarchal authority as a reaction against feminism. Former studio executive Peter Biskind, in &quot;Easy Riders and Raging Bulls&quot;, describes the film as &quot;a male nightmare of female puberty. Emergent female sexuality is equated with demonic possession.&quot; For the male authority figures in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, whether priests or physicians, Regan must be restored to her innocence through abusive and violent means if necessary. Many feminist critics, like Biskind, note the film&#x27;s focus on the female body as the site of horror. &quot;When her body changes, Regan becomes &quot;someone else&quot;; someone sexual, whose desire is a dark visitor&quot; writes Jude Ellison Doyle in &quot;Dead Blondes and Bad Mothers: Monstrosity, Patriarchy and the Fear of Female Power&quot;. &quot;To become a woman is to become the ... enemy of all that is pure or holy.&quot; But Australian film studies professor Barbara Creed, in &quot;The Monstrous-Feminine&quot;, which inaugurated psychoanalytic feminist film theory, counters the prevailing feminist take on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; by insisting that Pazuzu is female and thus the possession of Regan is itself a feminist act, exposing &quot;the inability of the male order to control the woman whose perversity is expressed through her rebellious body&quot;, as she navigates an incestuous desire for her mother. University of Toronto professor S. Trimble writes that the film tapped into &quot;white American fears of nightmare futures&quot; that could result from the women&#x27;s liberation, gay liberation and Black Power movements&#x27; challenge to the established 1970s social order. As a film about &quot;a revolting girl revolting against the little-girl box in which she was stuck&quot; and army of men trying to put her back, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; follows older horror movies that use gender-bending to create a monster, Trimble notes.

Texas State religious studies professor Joseph Laycock wrote that the popular embrace of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; also pointed to reactionary popular trends in American religion. &quot;&quot;The Exorcist&quot; is a depiction not of ecclesiastical Catholicism but of &quot;folk piety&quot;&quot;, which he also describes as extra-ecclesiastical religion, pursued by the lay masses, &quot;incorporat[ing] beliefs about divine or supernatural intervention in the realm of everyday experience&quot;, as tolerant of Ouija boards and practices from other spiritual traditions as it was devout in its Catholic faith. In the early 1970s, organized religion in America had increasingly turned towards the rational as the country became more secular: &quot;The authentic folk piety depicted in &quot;The Exorcist&quot; likely appealed to audiences [at the time] because it was a welcome alternative to rationalized religion and a cultural myth of universal secularization.&quot;

==Litigation==
Lawsuits among the creators of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; began before the film was released, and continued into the 21st century. In November 1973, Blatty sued the studio and Friedkin. He demanded equal billing with Friedkin, who he further claimed had barred him from the set. Friedkin said he had only barred him from post-production; Blatty settled for the &quot;William Peter Blatty&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot;&quot; line. In February 1974, Dietz claimed Friedkin had made her sign a nondisclosure agreement. While Friedkin had, in earlier publicity for the film, denied any use of a double for Blair, by the end of the month Dietz was saying she neither claimed to have been the only double for the possession scenes nor talked about it to the media. The Screen Actors Guild ruled her contract was not binding, but then Dietz declined to arbitrate the matter.

In 2001, following the release of the extended version, Blatty and Friedkin sued Warner Bros., alleging that they had been cheated out of profits they would receive for helping promote the film. Later that year, they sued again, alleging that the studio had further defrauded them over the last decade by failing to get full market value for various licensing deals for the film. It was settled confidentially two years later. In 2012, Blatty sued Warner Bros. again, asking for the opportunity to inspect the studio&#x27;s records and accounts, to see whether he had been paid what he was owed.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Exorcist&quot; has had a lasting effect on the horror film genre and become a cultural reference point.

===Effect on films and industry===
&quot;Cinefantastique&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;The Exorcist&quot; has done for the horror film what &quot;2001&quot; did for science fiction, legitimizing it in the eyes of thousands who previously considered horror movies nothing more than a giggle&quot;. Studios subsequently allotted large budgets to horror films with similar themes like &quot;The Omen&quot;, &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;, &quot;Audrey Rose&quot; and &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;. Horror films began to cast well-known actors, who until then had often avoided the genre in their career prime. Friedkin&#x27;s use of works like &quot;Polymorphia&quot; in the score also led to the use of modern avant-garde composers like Krzysztof Penderecki in later horror films such as &quot;The Shining&quot;. Composers of original music for those films adopted some avant-garde techniques, like dissonant intervals such as tritones, sound massing and tone clusters, to create unease and tension.

The film&#x27;s success led Warner Bros. to release the sequel &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; in 1977, marking one of the first times a studio had done that with a major film not planned to have one, launching a franchise. While many classic horror films of the 1930s had spawned series of films, the practice had declined in the 1960s. Before the 1970s, most sequels had been secondary properties for the studios. The other big-budget horror films made in the wake of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; also led to sequels and franchises. Amy Chambers observes that Friedkin set a precedent not only by extensively consulting with technical experts in the subject matter, in his case physicians and priests, but foregrounding that reliance by including those experts&#x27; names and credentials in the film&#x27;s credits and press kit, a practice now common.

===Cultural reference point===
&quot;The Exorcist&quot; has become a cultural reference point. Its imagery, particularly Regan in her bedroom, has been used by political cartoonists like Mike Luckovich and Mike Peters. In 1998, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Maureen Dowd wrote when criticizing the nation&#x27;s apparent indulgence of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s sexual indiscretions: &quot;[P]eople are saying things so bizarre they could have come out of Linda Blair in &quot;The Exorcist.&quot; ... You expect the feminists&#x27; heads to start rotating on their necks any moment now.&quot; Father Merrin&#x27;s arrival scene is another reference. In an episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;Square Pegs&quot;, Don Novello, as his &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) character Father Guido Sarducci, enters a classroom, similarly backlit amidst fog, in order to exorcise a character &quot;possessed&quot; by the Pac-Man video game. In an episode set on Halloween 2019, an episode of &quot;Evil&quot;, another CBS series, paid homage to the scene. In 1992, the heavy metal band Pantera named its sixth studio album &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;, from the possessed Regan&#x27;s riposte to Karras when he suggests she could make the straps disappear, similarly titling a book about the band&#x27;s adventures on tour. In 2023 a protist that lives inside a South American termite&#x27;s gut was named Daimonympha friedkini after the movie and its director.

Popular comedy took inspiration from the film. &quot;SNL&quot; parodied the film during its first season, with Richard Pryor in the Karras role and Laraine Newman as Regan. In 2023, the show again parodied the film, with host Jenna Ortega in the Regan role. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, in 1984, included &quot;The Exorcist&quot; among the horror films it referenced. In one scene, Sigourney Weaver&#x27;s character, possessed by an evil spirit, begins to speak with a deep, husky voice and levitates above her bed as Bill Murray&#x27;s character talks with her. In 1990, Blair starred as a housewife needing exorcism in the parody &quot;Repossessed&quot;.

Religious wariness toward the film abated as it became a classic. &quot;&quot;The Exorcist&quot; exposed people around the world to the question of evil in a new and terrifying way&quot;, wrote Jesuit Jim McDermott in a 2019 issue of &quot;America&quot;. &quot;It is a film that takes on big questions and aspires to do much more than shock.&quot; In the heavily Baptist American South, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was seen as acceptable viewing amid denunciations of many other horror films that supposedly promoted the occult, because, as a writer in &quot;Slate&quot; recalls, it &quot;didn&#x27;t encourage people to dabble in the dark arts, they &quot;warned&quot; people. More to the point, they acknowledged the existence of God, the influence of Satan, and the truth of the Bible.&quot; British Baptist minister Peter Laws has credited the film with persuading him to abandon atheism and become a Christian, since &quot;it suggested ... that God might be the only truly effective answer to evil, that [He] might be real and the church might sometimes be filed under &#x27;solution&#x27;, not &#x27;problem&#x27;&quot;.

In 2015, the District of Columbia posted a commemorative plaque on the Exorcist steps, since they had become a tourist attraction. At a ceremony the day before Halloween that year, Blatty and Friedkin were present as the plaque, with Mayor Muriel Bowser&#x27;s signature, was unveiled. Friedkin said that having his name on the plaque was a greater honor than another Academy Award, since &quot;the Academy may come and go. Its importance has been diminished over the years anyway. But that plaque on those steps is going to be there for a very long time.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;The Exorcist&quot; was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won two. It was the first horror film to be nominated for Best Picture. It won four of seven Golden Globe nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Drama. Robert Knudson and Chris Newman won &quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s first Oscar, for Best Sound, thanking Friedkin, the studio and their crews, at the ceremony. Blatty won for Best Adapted Screenplay, accepting the award from Angie Dickinson and Miller, who applauded Blatty vigorously. In his short speech, Blatty posthumously thanked William Bloom, &quot;who taught me the rudiments and the craft of screenwriting&quot; and Friedkin. He also paid tribute to his parents, &quot;whose love and whose courage have brought me to this moment and to this place.&quot; The next morning, Blatty complained in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; (THR) that &quot;The Exorcist&quot; had not won all the awards it was nominated for, as it was &quot;head and shoulders, the finest film made this year and in many other years&quot;. He accused veteran director George Cukor of having campaigned against the film.

===Sequels and prequels===
A year after &quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s release, &quot;New York&quot; reported that a sequel was planned, with Friedkin producing and Blatty uninvolved. Friedkin backed out, and only Blair and von Sydow returned. Boorman directed and Richard Burton played the lead. The film suffered production problems, particular cast and crew health issues, and was beset by regular script rewrites and personnel changes. Upon its release in 1977, &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; had what was then Warner Bros.&#x27; largest opening-day gross, but was less successful than the original. Afterward, Blatty and Friedkin began planning a story and script for a sequel of their own. Blatty continued after Friedkin dropped out and developed the story into the novel &quot;Legion&quot; in 1983, after Hollywood showed little interest. He saw it as an exploration of the same themes within the same fictional universe by some of the original&#x27;s minor characters. The media saw it as a sequel, and it sold well. In 1990, Blatty adapted a more streamlined script from the novel for Morgan Creek Productions and 20th Century Fox, titled &quot;The Exorcist III&quot;. He also directed, with George C. Scott replacing the deceased Cobb as Kinderman.

Morgan Creek and James G. Robinson, producer of &quot;Exorcist III&quot;, had commissioned a prequel story about a young Father Merrin&#x27;s first confrontation with Pazuzu. It was produced in 2002, with Paul Schrader directing and Stellan Skarsgård in the lead. Robinson hired Renny Harlin to reshoot most of the film with Skarsgård and a new cast after disagreements with Schrader. Harlin&#x27;s version, heavy on action and horror, was released in 2004 as &quot;&quot;, and was a critical and commercial failure. Schrader&#x27;s version received a limited release in 2005 as &quot;&quot;, a version Blatty found much better.

In 2020, Morgan Creek announced a reboot of the film; fans petitioned to cancel it. At the end of the year, Blumhouse Productions and Morgan Creek said that David Gordon Green would instead direct a direct sequel to the 1973 film, and later a trilogy produced by Jason Blum alongside James and David Robinson. Burstyn reprised her role, with Leslie Odom Jr. co-starring. The films would be released by Universal Pictures and Peacock, with the second and third films optioned as Peacock exclusives. The first, &quot;The Exorcist: Believer&quot;, was released in October 2023. However, following the film&#x27;s very poor reception, plans for the trilogy were officially scrapped the following year and the franchise was rebooted again with a new installment from director Mike Flanagan.

===TV series===

The 2016 Fox TV series &quot;The Exorcist&quot; followed two priests investigating possible cases of demonic possession and performing exorcisms. In the fifth episode, Angela Rance was revealed as the adult Regan, making the series a direct sequel to the original film. It was cancelled after its second season.

==Other related works==
Blatty&#x27;s script for the film has been published in two versions. &quot;William Peter Blatty on The Exorcist: From Novel to Film&quot;, in 1974, included the first draft of the screenplay. In 1998, the script was anthologized in &quot;The Exorcist/Legion - Two Classic Screenplays&quot;, and again as a standalone text in 2000.

<text>Bairbre de Brún (born 10 January 1954) is a former Irish Sinn Féin politician who was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Northern Ireland from 2004 to 2012.

== Political work ==
Born in Dublin on 10 January 1954, de Brún began her political career as a member of the &quot;National Committee Against the H-Blocks &amp; Armagh Gaol&quot; in the late 1970s and early 1980s, focusing heavily on the treatment of women in Armagh Gaol. De Brún became an early member of Sinn Féin&#x27;s Ard Chomhairle () and in 1998 became an MLA in the Northern Ireland Assembly, representing West Belfast. She was Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.

By profession, de Brún was a teacher and taught in the Irish-medium education sector in west Belfast. She was also a French and German teacher and is noted for her devotion to the Irish language. She has lived in the Andersonstown area of Belfast since the early 1980s. She is a fluent Irish speaker and an expert in human rights and equality issues. De Brún is also a member of the Sinn Féin negotiating team and travelled internationally on numerous occasions to promote the Irish peace process.

She was a member of the Environment and Petitions Committee in the European Parliament and a substitute member of the Regional Development Committee. Following the 2004 Euro elections she was one of two Sinn Féin MEPs and the first Sinn Féin politician to represent Northern Ireland in the European Parliament. She sat with the European United Left - Nordic Green Left. She topped the poll in the Northern Ireland constituency of the European Parliament in the 2009 European elections, a first for a nationalist or republican party.

She has also been a strong supporter of the Irish language and its use globally, and was one of the only MEPs to use Irish as her primary language, rarely making speeches within the parliament in English.

De Brún was a member of the Regional Policy Committee in the European Parliament and a substitute member of the Environment Committee. Within the EU parliament she focused on environmental issues. She was part of an EU delegation that attended the 2011 Durban Climate Change Conference. She was critical of the final report of the conference saying &quot;We need to recognise that even the best possible outcome from Durban still only takes us half way down the road we need to travel&quot;.

She resigned from the European Parliament in May 2012 for &quot;personal reasons&quot; although it was reported that she intended on remaining active within the party. She was succeeded by Martina Anderson, an MLA for Foyle.

<text>The study of how language influences thought, and vice-versa, has a long history in a variety of fields. There are two bodies of thought forming around this debate. One body of thought stems from linguistics and is known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. There is a strong and a weak version of the hypothesis which argue for more or less influence of language on thought. The strong version, linguistic determinism, argues that without language there is and can be no thought (a largely discredited idea), while the weak version, linguistic relativity, supports the idea that there are some influences from language on thought. And on the opposing side, there are &#x27;language of thought&#x27; theories (LOTH) which believe that public language is inessential to private thought (though the possibility remains that private thought &quot;when infused with inessential language&quot; diverges in predilection, emphasis, tone, or subsequent recollection). LOTH theories address the debate of whether thought is possible without language which is related to the question of whether language evolved &quot;for&quot; thought. These ideas are difficult to study because it proves challenging to parse the effects of culture versus thought versus language in all academic fields.

The main use of language is to convey information. It can be used to transfer thoughts from one mind, to another mind, and it can also be used to modify and explore thoughts within a mind. The bits of linguistic information that enter into one person&#x27;s mind, from another, cause people to entertain a new thought with profound effects on their world knowledge, inferencing, and subsequent behavior. In the act of speaking, thought comes first, while spoken or written language is an expression that follows. Language has certain limitations, and humans cannot express all that they think. Writing was a powerful new invention because it enabled revision of language, allowing an initial thought to be conveyed, reviewed and revised before expression.

Language can also be used for thought, framing and modifying thinking with a precision that was not possible without language.

== The language of thought ==
Language of thought theories rely on the belief that mental representation has linguistic structure. Thoughts are &quot;sentences in the head&quot;, meaning they take place within a mental language. Two theories work in support of the language of thought theory. Causal syntactic theory of mental practices hypothesizes that mental processes are causal processes defined over the syntax of mental representations. Representational theory of mind hypothesizes that propositional attitudes are relations between subjects and mental representations. In tandem, these theories explain how the brain can produce rational thought and behavior. All three of these theories were inspired by the development of modern logical inference. They were also inspired by Alan Turing&#x27;s work on causal processes that require formal procedures within physical machines.

LOTH hinges on the belief that the mind works like a computer, always in computational processes. The theory believes that mental representation has both a combinatorial syntax and compositional semantics. The claim is that mental representations possess combinatorial syntax and compositional semantic—that is, mental representations are sentences in a mental language. Alan Turing&#x27;s work on physical machines implementation of causal processes that require formal procedures was modeled after these beliefs.

Another prominent linguist, Steven Pinker, developed this idea of a mental language in his book &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; (1994). Pinker refers to this mental language as &quot;mentalese&quot;. In the glossary of his book, Pinker defines mentalese as a hypothetical language used specifically for thought. This hypothetical language houses mental representations of concepts such as the meaning of words and sentences.

==Scientific hypotheses==
* The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis in linguistics states that the grammatical structure of a mother language influences the way we perceive the world. The hypothesis has been largely abandoned by linguists as it has found very limited experimental support, at least in its strong form, linguistic determinism. For instance, a study showing that speakers of languages lacking a subjunctive mood such as Chinese experience difficulty with hypothetical problems has been discredited. Another study did show that subjects in memory tests are more likely to remember a given color if their mother language includes a word for that color; however, these findings do not necessarily support this hypothesis specifically. Other studies concerning the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis can be found in the &quot;studies&quot; section below.
* Chomsky&#x27;s independent theory, founded by Noam Chomsky, considers language as one aspect of cognition. Chomsky&#x27;s theory states that a number of cognitive systems exist, which seem to possess distinct specific properties. These cognitive systems lay the groundwork for cognitive capacities, like language faculty. 
* Piaget&#x27;s cognitive determinism exhibits the belief that infants integrate experience into progressively higher-level representations. He calls this belief constructivism, which supports that infants progress from simple to sophisticated models of the world through a change mechanism that allows an infant to build on their lower-level representations to create higher-level ones. This view opposes nativist theories about cognition being composed of innate knowledge and abilities. 
* Vygotsky&#x27;s theory on cognitive development, known as Vygotsky&#x27;s theory of interchanging roles, supports the idea that social and individual development stems from the processes of dialectical interaction and function unification. Lev Vygotsky believed that before two years of age, both speech and thought develop in differing ways along with differing functions. The idea that relationship between thought and speech is ever-changing, supports Vygotsky&#x27;s claims. Vygotsky&#x27;s theory claims that thought and speech have different roots. And at the age of two, a child&#x27;s thought and speech collide, and the relationship between thought and speech shifts. Thought then becomes verbal and speech then becomes rational.
* According to the theory behind cognitive therapy, founded by Aaron T. Beck, our emotions and behavior are caused by our internal dialogue. We can change ourselves by learning to challenge and refute our own thoughts, especially a number of specific mistaken thought patterns called &quot;cognitive distortions&quot;. Cognitive therapy has been found to be effective by empirical studies.
* In behavioral economics, according to experiments said to support the theoretical availability heuristic, people believe events that are more vividly described are more probable than those that are not. Simple experiments that asked people to imagine something led them to believe it to be more likely. The mere exposure effect may also be relevant to propagandistic repetition like the Big Lie. According to prospect theory, people make different economic choices based on how the matter is framed.

== Studies concerning the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis ==

===Counting===
Different cultures use numbers in different ways. The Munduruku culture for example, has number words only up to five. In addition, they refer to the number 5 as &quot;a hand&quot; and the number 10 as &quot;two hands&quot;. Numbers above 10 are usually referred to as &quot;many&quot;.

Perhaps the most different counting system from that of modern Western civilisation is the &quot;one-two-many&quot; system used by the Pirahã people. In this system, quantities larger than two are referred to simply as &quot;many&quot;. In larger quantities, &quot;one&quot; can also mean a small amount and &quot;many&quot; a larger amount. Research was conducted in the Pirahã culture using various matching tasks. These are non-linguistic tasks that were analyzed to see if their counting system or more importantly their language affected their cognitive abilities. The results showed that they perform quite differently from, for example, an English speaking person who has a language with words for numbers more than two. For example, they were able to represent numbers 1 and 2 accurately using their fingers but as the quantities grew larger (up to 10), their accuracy diminished. This phenomenon is also called the &quot;analog estimation&quot;, as numbers get bigger the estimation grows. Their declined performance is an example of how a language can affect thought and great evidence to support the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis.

===Orientation===
Language also seems to shape how people from different cultures orient themselves in space. For instance, many Australian Aboriginal Nations, such as the Kuuk Thaayorre, exclusively use cardinal-direction terms – north, south, east and west – and never define space relative to the observer. Instead of using terms like &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;back&quot; and &quot;forward&quot;, speakers from such cultures would say, &quot;There is a spider on your northeast leg,&quot; or &quot;Pass the ball to the south southwest.&quot; In fact, instead of &quot;hello&quot;, the greeting in such cultures is, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; and sometimes even &quot;Where are you coming from?&quot; Such a greeting would be followed by a directional answer: &quot;To the northeast in the middle distance.&quot; The consequence of using such language is that the speakers need to be constantly oriented in space, otherwise they would not be able to express themselves properly, or even get past a greeting. Speakers of languages that rely on absolute reference frames have a greater navigational ability and spatial knowledge compared to speakers of languages that use relative reference frames. In comparison with English users, speakers of languages such as Kuuk Thaayorre are also much better at staying oriented even in unfamiliar spaces, and there is strong evidence that their language is what enables them to do this.

===Color===

Language may influence color processing. Having more names for different colors, or different shades of colors, makes it easier both for children and for adults to recognize them. Research has found that all languages have names for black and white and that the colors defined by each language follow a certain pattern (i.e. a language with three colors also defines red, one with four defines green OR yellow, one with six defines blue, then brown, then other colors).

==Other schools of thought==
* General semantics is a school of thought founded by engineer Alfred Korzybski in the 1930s and later popularized by S.I. Hayakawa and others, which attempted to make language more precise and objective. It makes many basic observations of the English language, particularly pointing out problems of abstraction and definition. General semantics is presented as both a theoretical and a practical system whose adoption can reliably alter human behavior in the direction of greater sanity. It is considered to be a branch of natural science and includes methods for the stimulation of the activities of the human cerebral cortex, which is generally judged by experimentation. In this theory, semantics refers to the total response to events and actions, not just the words. The neurological, emotional, cognitive, semantic, and behavioral reactions to events determines the semantic response of a situation. This reaction can be referred to as semantic response, evaluative response, or total response.
* E-prime is a constructed language identical to the English language but lacking all forms of &quot;to be&quot;. Its proponents claim that dogmatic thinking seems to rely on &quot;to be&quot; language constructs, and so by removing it we may discourage dogmatism.
* Neuro-linguistic programming, founded by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, claims that language &quot;patterns&quot; and other things can affect thought and behavior. It takes ideas from General Semantics and hypnosis, especially that of the famous therapist Milton Erickson. Many do not consider it a credible study, and it has no empirical scientific support.
* Advocates of non-sexist language including some feminists say that the English language perpetuates biases against women, such as using male-gendered terms such as &quot;he&quot; and &quot;man&quot; as generic. Many authors including those who write textbooks now conspicuously avoid that practice, in the case of the previous examples using words like &quot;he or she&quot; or &quot;they&quot; and &quot;human race&quot;.
* Various other schools of persuasion directly suggest using language in certain ways to change the minds of others, including oratory, advertising, debate, sales, and rhetoric. The ancient sophists discussed and listed many figures of speech such as enthymeme and euphemism. The modern public relations term for adding persuasive elements to the interpretation of and commentary on news is called spin.
* Studies in psychology have found that bilingual people respond differently when they complete tasks in different languages. For example, one study randomly assigned bilingual people in India to complete a work task in Hindi or English. Social norms were more effective at motivating people to work longer in Hindi, whereas payment was more effective in English, which is similar to results when people work in their native languages in the US and India. Another study randomly assigned bilingual managers in Hong Kong to rate the importance of different values in English or Chinese. When surveyed English, managers in Hong Kong rated conformity and tradition less important, and they rated achievement and hedonism as more important.

==Popular culture==
The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is the premise of the 2016 science fiction film &quot;Arrival&quot;. The protagonist explains that &quot;the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is the theory that the language you speak determines how you think&quot;.

<text>Murder by Death is a 1976 American comedy mystery film directed by Robert Moore and written by Neil Simon. The film stars Eileen Brennan, Truman Capote, James Coco, Peter Falk, Alec Guinness, Elsa Lanchester, David Niven, Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, Nancy Walker, and Estelle Winwood.

The plot is a broad parody or spoof of the traditional country-house whodunit, familiar to mystery fiction fans of classics such as Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;. The cast is an ensemble of British and American actors playing send-ups of well-known fictional sleuths, including Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Charlie Chan, Nick and Nora Charles, and Sam Spade. It also features a rare acting performance by author Truman Capote.

The film was presented at the Venice International Film Festival on September 5, 1976.

==Plot==
A group of five renowned detectives, each accompanied by a relative or associate, is invited to &quot;dinner and a murder&quot; by the mysterious Lionel Twain. Having lured his guests to his mansion managed by a blind butler named Jamessir Bensonmum, who is later joined by a deaf, mute, and illiterate cook named Yetta, Twain joins his guests at dinner. He presses a button which seals off the house. Twain announces that he is the greatest criminologist in the world. To prove his claim, he challenges the guests to solve a murder that will occur at midnight; a reward of $1 million will be presented to the winner.

Before midnight, the butler is found dead. Twain disappears, only to re-appear immediately after midnight, stabbed twelve times in the back with a butcher knife. The cook is also discovered to have been an animated mannequin, now packed in a storage crate. The party spends the rest of the night investigating and bickering. They are manipulated by a mysterious behind-the-scenes force, confused by red herrings, and baffled by the &quot;mechanical marvel&quot; that is Twain&#x27;s house. They ultimately find their own lives threatened. Each sleuth presents his or her theory on the case, pointing out the others&#x27; past connections to Twain and their possible motives for murdering him.

When they retire to their guest rooms for the night, the guests are each confronted by things that threaten to kill them: a deadly snake, a venomous scorpion, a descending ceiling, poison gas, and a bomb. They all survive, and in the morning, they gather in the office, where they find the butler waiting, very much alive and not blind. Each detective presents a different piece of evidence with which they each independently solved the mystery, and in each case, they accuse the butler of being one of Twain&#x27;s former associates.

At first, the butler plays the part of each person with whom he is identified, but then he pulls off a mask to reveal Lionel Twain himself, alive. Twain disparages the detectives—and metafictionally, the authors who created them—for the way their adventures have been handled. He points out such authorial misdeeds as introducing crucial characters at the last minute for the traditional &quot;twist in the tale&quot; (something the assembled detectives had been doing a few minutes earlier) and withholding clues and information to make it impossible for the reader to solve the mystery. Each of the detectives departs the house empty-handed, none of them having won the $1 million. When asked whether there had been a murder, Wang replies, &quot;Yes: killed good weekend.&quot;

Alone, Twain pulls off yet another mask to reveal Yetta, who lights a cigarette and laughs maniacally while rings of tobacco smoke fill the screen.

==Cast and characters==
The story takes place in and around the isolated country home populated by eccentric multi-millionaire Lionel Twain (Truman Capote), his blind butler Jamessir Bensonmum (Alec Guinness), and a deaf-mute cook named Yetta (Nancy Walker). &quot;Lionel Twain&quot; is a pun on &quot;Lionel Train&quot;. The participants are all pastiches of famous fictional detectives:
* Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers) is based on Earl Derr Biggers&#x27; Chinese/Hawaiian police detective Charlie Chan and is appropriately accompanied by his adopted Japanese son Willie (Richard Narita). Wang wears elaborate Chinese costumes, and his comically broken English is criticized by Twain and others.
* Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith) are polished, sophisticated society types modeled on Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s characters Nick and Nora Charles from the &quot;Thin Man&quot; film series. The Charles&#x27; wire-haired terrier &quot;Asta&quot; is also lampooned, appearing here named &quot;Myron&quot;.
* Milo Perrier (James Coco) is a take on Agatha Christie&#x27;s Hercule Poirot and arrives at the house with his heavily French-accented chauffeur Marcel Cassette (James Cromwell in his first feature film role). The demanding, portly Perrier is overly fond of food and appears annoyed that he must share a room with the lowly Marcel, although the two are later seen sharing not only a room but a bed, quibbling like a married couple. Perrier is repeatedly annoyed by being mistaken for a Frenchman as he is Belgian, saying, &quot;I am not a &#x27;Frenchie&#x27;...I am a &#x27;Belgie&#x27;.&quot;
* Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) parodies another Dashiell Hammett character, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;″s hardboiled Sam Spade, and is a caricature of Humphrey Bogart in his &quot;Casablanca&quot; character. He is accompanied by his long-suffering, hard-boiled, sexy but needy secretary Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan), whom he continually denigrates and mistreats. Tess Skeffington&#x27;s name is a riff on Spade&#x27;s secretary Effie Perine.
* Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester) parodies Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple. In the film, Marbles appears as hearty, robust and tweed-clad, wheeling a frail, ancient-looking, seemingly senile companion—her ancient &quot;nurse&quot; Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood), for whom &quot;she&quot; is now caring—who everyone initially assumes is Miss Marbles.

==Production==
The film was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, then named &quot;The Burbank Studios&quot;.

Charles Addams, creator of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, drew the art and caricatures displayed at the beginning, during the end credits, and on the poster.

===Deleted scenes===
An additional scene, not in the theatrical version but shown in some television versions, shows Sherlock Holmes (Keith McConnell) and Doctor Watson (Richard Peel) arriving as the other guests are leaving; they ask directions from Sidney Wang, who chooses not to warn them and tells Willie, &quot;Let idiots find out for themselves.&quot; Author Ron Haydock states that an early draft of Neil Simon&#x27;s script featured Holmes and Watson actually solving the mystery, but their roles were reduced to a cameo appearance and finally deleted, as the lead actors felt they were being &quot;upstaged&quot;.

There were three other scenes deleted from the film:
*En route to the Twain mansion, the Charlestons nearly run down Tess Skeffington, who is returning to Sam Diamond&#x27;s car with gasoline; instead of giving her a lift, they apologize and drive on.
*Upon arriving at the Twain mansion, Jessica Marbles&#x27; London cabbie lets her know the fare. 
*After Twain&#x27;s murder, Willie Wang claims to have found a clue in the dead man&#x27;s hand that was overlooked by the great detectives; the clue, a note from &quot;Lionel Twain, deceased&quot;, turns out to only be a reminder to the milkman to stop delivery.

==Novelization==
A novelization based on Neil Simon&#x27;s script was written by H. R. F. Keating and published in the United States by Warner Books () and by Star Books in the United Kingdom. The novelization contains the deleted Tess Skeffington and Willie Wang scenes, as well as a totally different ending in which Bensonmum is revealed to be still alive and Twain admits that although the detectives failed, they failed brilliantly and have made him love them all again.

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Murder by Death&quot; holds a rating of 63% from 24 reviews.

===Domestic reviews===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film had one of Simon&#x27;s &quot;nicest, breeziest screenplays,&quot; with James Coco &quot;very, very funny as the somewhat prissy take-off on Hercule Poirot&quot; and David Niven and Maggie Smith &quot;marvelous as Dick and Dora Charleston, though they haven&#x27;t enough to do.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a very good silly-funny Neil Simon satirical comedy, with a super all-star cast,&quot; adding, &quot;It&#x27;s the sort of film one could see more than once and pick up on comedy bits unnoticed at first. Dave Grusin&#x27;s music is another highlight.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found the film &quot;amusing&quot; but added, &quot;Why it is only amusing, and not hilarious, madcap, riotous, rip-roaring, or richly romping, I don&#x27;t entirely know. It&#x27;s a short movie (94 minutes) but a slow one, surprisingly so when you&#x27;d have said knockabout speed was called for.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that &quot;after getting off to a shaky start, the picture quickly hits a speedball comedy pace it doesn&#x27;t lose until the unsatisfactory unravelling of the mystery.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that &quot;this burlesque whodunit is probably too static and thinly contrived to generate a lasting sense of pleasure, but it&#x27;s the kind of skillfully obvious, mock-innocent spoof that seems good fun while it lasts, and the fun is enhanced by the most adept and attractive comedy cast in recent memory.&quot; John Simon wrote, &quot;Murder by Death is not a movie to write or read about, but to be seen and modestly enjoyed&quot;. Kathleen Carroll of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote that the characters are &quot;the impish inventions of writer Neil Simon, who, in caricaturing this Round Table meeting of the world&#x27;s greatest fictional detectives, displays his usual killer&#x27;s instinct for sharp, savvy comedy. His &#x27;Murder by Death&#x27; is not without flaws, however: there are lapses in taste, and some of his gags are just awful; the production has a routine Movie-of-the-Week look to it; and poor Truman Capote is an unfortunate choice for Twain, looking more pained than menacing—as if the whole experience had been about as pleasurable as sitting in a dentist&#x27;s chair. But then what amateur actor wouldn&#x27;t panic in the presence of this wonderful cast? The special joy of &quot;Murder by Death&quot; lies in savoring the individual performances, so rare is it to see truly stylish acting on the screen these days.&quot; Dale Stevens of &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; said that &quot;there is a deliciously old-fashioned feeling about the movie &#x27;Murder By Death,&#x27; from the moment the first old car falters its way through fog and mist and a voice that belongs to Humphrey Bogart comes out of Peter Falk.&quot; Stanley Eichelbaum of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; said that &quot;there&#x27;s so much enjoyable nonsense in &quot;Murder By Death,&quot; which opens today at the Cinema 21, I suppose it doesn&#x27;t matter that Neil Simon&#x27;s spoof of Hollywood and British detective mysteries is a thin, somewhat labored invention. Before it begins to sag and run out of steam, it&#x27;s a delightful lark, and, even with shortcomings, the funniest, looniest film of the year.&quot; Edward L. Blank of &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; said &quot;it surpasses &#x27;Barefoot in the Park&#x27; and &#x27;The Odd Couple&#x27; to become his funniest film. In a screenplay calculated to be as absurd as possible, not all the gags work. A running gimmick involving identical rooms never amuses, and the picture ends in a fizzle of senseless surprises. (Don&#x27;t bother trying to sort it out; Simon&#x27;s inspiration obviously petered out five minutes too soon.) Most of it works, though, and what does is hilarious.&quot;

Giles M. Fowler of &quot;The Kansas City Times&quot; wrote that &quot;somewhere about midway, the movie sags a bit as the emphasis shifts from broad character to even broader action. When Simon tries to zip up the comedy with wild plot mechanics—none of which it would be fair to divulge here—the situations start to feel strained and repetitive. Much of the humor is recovered in the last scene or two, but I still left with the feeling that &#x27;Murder by Death&#x27; falls short of its great potential.&quot; Corbin Patrick of &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; wrote that &quot;Simon, hitherto known chiefly for Broadway comedy hits including &#x27;Plaza Suite&#x27; and &#x27;The Odd Couple,&#x27; makes highly amusing fun of all the cliches of detective fiction in his script for this film. In doing this he&#x27;s turned a neat trick, making it suspenseful as well as funny. It&#x27;s a gem of its genre.&quot; Susan Stark of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; said that &quot;the idea behind &#x27;Murder by Death,&#x27; Neil Simon&#x27;s first comedy written expressly for the screen, is to bring together the legendary sleuths for the purpose of having them collaborate on a murder case. A mouthwatering&#x27; idea. And its result in some perfectly delicious comedy, based on the pleasure of watching not only Simon&#x27;s satirical version of the characters interact, but also of watching the stars who play them interact.&quot;

Don Morrison wrote in &quot;The Minneapolis Star&quot;: Dave Lanken of the Montreal &quot;Gazette&quot; wrote that the film has &quot;a delightful cast, and the results of letting such a bunch of hams ham it up is delightful, too. Director Robert Moore, who previously directed several of Neil Simon&#x27;s Broadway hits, makes his film debut here and keeps everything rolling nicely.&quot; Barbara Thomas of &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; remarked that &quot;the movie often doesn&#x27;t make much sense and the trick on the identity of the real Lionel Twain ends on a murky note. However, it&#x27;s quite possible one wouldn’t notice such a substantial flaw for all the puns and comedy afoot. There are a few clues to add to spice up the plot. [...] The screenplay is an original from Simon, a favorite of folks who like their laughs quick and obvious. It’s among the better of his works and serves as the basis for a delightful film.&quot; Richard Dyer of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that &quot;none of the plot and incident, in fact, is important in this movie: they exist as opportunities to give big-name actors a lot of showy opportunities. Director Roger Moore made his name by creating the superb ensemble playing in the original stage production of &quot;The Boys in the Band,&quot; but there is little ensemble here just a series of star turns. Falk&#x27;s broad Bogart burlesque has its moments, but Niven and Smith consistently fare best because they appreciate the value of understatement; James Coco certainly does not. Capote, in his screen debut—but hardly his acting debut—lisps mechanically through his role (is his real name Lionel Train?) and he looks like a malevolent mongoose. Essentially, though, this is Neil Simon&#x27;s movie his name, in fact, is part of the title. No one writes a better gag-line than he does: some of the movie is hilarious.&quot;

Clyde Gilmour offered a more negative view of the film in &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, saying that &quot;Murder by Death seems to me to offer three or four good laughs and half a dozen chuckles. True enough, that’s a lot better than no laughs at all. But it’s still a deplorably thin cargo of mirth in a 93-minute entertainment from the pen of the erstwhile merry fellow who gave the world &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. Not to mention his new smash-hit on Broadway, &quot;California Suite&quot;.&quot;

===International reviews=== 
Arthur Thirkell of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in the UK called the film &quot;a clever, fun-filled parody of five well-known fictional detectives Charlie Chan, The Thin Man, Miss Marple, Sam Spade and Hercule Poirot. Mr. Simon has altered the names, but retained the flavour of each tec&#x27;s individual style and dialogue. The result is a movie that will tickle the fancy of Agatha Christie and Dashiell Hammett fans and get chuckles from those usually cynically disposed towards corny, contrived sleuthing in fog-shrouded mansions.&quot;

Eric Shorter of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said that &quot;the pleasure lies in the acting, or rather the impersonations, of legendary sleuths such as Charlie Chan (Peter Sellers), Humphrey Bogart (Peter Falk), Miss Marple (Elsa Lanchester), and so on, rather than in the relentless verbal gagging of Mr Simon or his teasing of thriller conventions.&quot;

Alexander Walker of the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; said that &quot;the high risk that critics run in reviewing Nell Simon screenplays Is an addiction to reviewing every Joke, which means taking down the whole dialogue verbatim. The risk eminently worth running, for this is a prime piece of malice aforethought that debunks the genre and, like its title, turns expectations back to front in that arrogant that detective-story authors do to reader-addicts.&quot;

Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as having &quot;a lot of crisp, semi-witty lines from one and all and a great deal of slightly over-ripe characterisation. It&#x27;s all very theatrical and none too cinematic, since Robert Moore, a director new to me, is no George Cukor—and that splendid veteran is the only person can wins of who could turn this type of clever charade into something more than a series of actorly turns.&quot;

Romola Costantino wrote in &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; that the &quot;picture reinforces a trust that top performers don&#x27;t let you down. An amazing performer in authorship, is playwright Neil Simon, who has brought enough laughter into the world in recent years to deserve some special award. Here he tackles a. tricky subject, because murder story spoofs can turn out tedious; but Simon&#x27;s magic touch &#x27; doesn&#x27;t fail him in this screenplay. Silly though they may sound, he makes the following angles hilariously funny: eerie old Gothic house, murder on the stroke of 12, screams in the night, a sinister butler, black-gloved hands groping around corners, guests trapped with no way out, gathering of famous detectives modelled on the best fictional master-minds, and a series of red-herring solutions to the mind-boggling whodunit mystery. Backing up Simon&#x27;s brilliance is an unbeatable cast of stylish actors whose names guarantee entertainment. [...] Absurdity is very amusing when it is topped off with this kind of elegance.&quot;

Colin Bennett of &quot;The Age&quot; wrote that &quot;by the end, after automatic daggers and shrinking rooms, scorpions and poisoned wine, and unmasked plastic corpses, the whodunit revelations have grown hopelessly tortuous. We can’t follow them. We are not meant to care and we don’t. For once, Neil Simon is writing his jokes without point or social observation, simply for the sake of easy laughter, comic pastiche at the expense of detective authors who cheat their readers. His characters are as thin as the Charles Addams cartoons that accompany the credits. Which is why I call Murder by Death a throwaway. You will chuckle for most of the hour and a half then forget it.&quot;

<text>Computer games, simulations, models, and operations research programs often require a mechanism to determine statistically how likely the engagement between a weapon and a target will result in a satisfactory outcome (i.e. &quot;kill&quot;), known as the probability of kill. Performance auditing and statistical decisions are required when all of the variables that must be considered are not incorporated into the current model, similar to the actuarial methods used by insurance companies to deal with large numbers of customers and huge numbers of variables. Likewise, military planners rely on such calculations to determine the quantity of weapons necessary to destroy an enemy force.

The probability of kill, or &quot;Pk&quot;, is usually based on a uniform random number generator. This algorithm creates a number between 0 and 1 that is approximately uniformly distributed in that space. If the Pk of a weapon/target engagement is 30% (or 0.30), then every random number generated that is less than 0.3 is considered a &quot;kill&quot;; every number greater than 0.3 is considered a &quot;no kill&quot;. When used many times in a simulation, the average result will be that 30% of the weapon/target engagements will be a kill and 70% will not be a kill.

This measure may also be used to express the accuracy of a weapon system, known as the probability of hit or &quot;Phit&quot;. For example, if a weapon is expected to hit a target nine times out of ten with a representative set of ten engagements, one could say that this weapon has a Phit of 0.9. If the chance of hits is nine out of ten, but the probability of a kill with a hit is 0.5, then the Pk becomes 0.45 or 45%. This reflects the fact that even modern guided warheads may not always destroy a hit target such as an aircraft, missile or main battle tank.

Additional factors include the probability of detection (Pd), reliability of the targeting system (Rsys), and reliability of the weapon (Rw), to name a few. For example, if a missile operates properly &quot;e.g.&quot; 90% of the time (assuming a good shot), the targeting system operates properly 85% of the time, and enemy targets are detected at 50%, accuracy of the Pk estimation can be increased:

Pk = Phit * Pd * Rsys * Rw

For example:

Pk = 0.9 * 0.5 * 0.85 * 0.90 = 0.344

Users can also specify a probability according to a class of targets, for example, it has been stated that the SA-10 surface-to-air missile system has a Pk of 0.9 against highly maneuvering targets, whereas its Pk against non-maneuvering targets is much higher.

<doc id="725484" wikidata="Q596905" url="?curid=725484" title="DualDisc">
<text>The DualDisc is a type of double-sided optical disc product developed by a group of record companies including MJJ Productions Inc., EMI Music, Universal Music Group, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and 5.1 Entertainment Group and later under the aegis of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It featured an audio layer intended to be compatible with CD players (but too thin to meet Red Book CD specifications) on one side and a standard DVD layer on the other. In this respect it was similar to, but distinct from, the DVDplus developed in Europe by Dieter Dierks and covered by European patents.

DualDiscs first appeared in the United States in March 2004 as part of a marketing test conducted by the same five record companies who developed the product. The test involved 13 titles being released to a limited number of retailers in the Boston, Massachusetts, and Seattle, Washington, markets. The test marketing was seen as a success after 82% of respondents to a survey (which was included with the test titles) said that DualDiscs met or exceeded their expectations. In addition, 90% of respondents said that they would recommend DualDisc to a friend. However, sales plummeted over the next three years, particularly in competition with rival formats like SACD and DVD-A discs.

DualDisc titles received a mass rollout to retailers throughout the United States in February 2005, though some titles were available as early as November 2004. The recording industry had nearly 200 DualDisc titles available by the end of 2005 and over 2,000,000 units had been sold by the middle of that year.

==Technical details==
DualDiscs were based on double-sided DVD technology such as DVD-10, DVD-14 and DVD-18 except that DualDisc technology replaced one of the DVD sides with a CD. The discs were made by fusing together a standard 0.6 mm-thick DVD layer (4.7-gigabyte storage capacity) to a 0.9 mm-thick CD layer (60-minute or 525-megabyte storage capacity), resulting in a 1.5 mm-thick double-sided hybrid disc which contained CD content on one side and DVD content on the other.

The challenge for the designers of DualDisc was to produce a dual-sided disc which was not too thick to play reliably in slot-loading drives, while the CD side was not too thin to be tracked easily by the laser. DVDplus, though conceptually similar, used a thicker CD layer and thus is more likely to get stuck in a slot-loading player (although this appears to be almost unknown); DualDisc took the other course by thinning the CD layer.

Because the 0.9 mm thickness of the DualDisc CD layer did not conform to Red Book CD specifications, which called for a layer no less than 1.1 mm thick, some CD players could not play the CD side of a DualDisc due to a phenomenon called spherical aberration. As a result, the laser reading the CD side might get a &quot;blurry&quot; picture of the data on the disc — the equivalent of a human reading a book with glasses of the wrong strength. Engineers tried to get around this by making the pits in the CD layer larger than on a conventional CD. This makes the CD side easier for the laser to read — equivalent to a book using bigger print to make it easier to see, even if the person&#x27;s glasses are of the wrong strength. The downside to this, however, is that the playing time for the CD layer of some early DualDiscs decreased from the standard 74 minutes of a conventional CD to around 60 minutes, although this early limitation was later overcome.

Because the DualDisc CD layer did not conform to Red Book specifications, Philips and Sony refused to allow DualDisc titles to carry the CD logo and most DualDiscs contain one of two warnings:

*&quot;This disc is intended to play on standard DVD and CD players.&quot;May not play on certain car, slot-loading players and mega-disc changers.&quot;&quot;
*&quot;The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of this disc.&quot;

The DVD side of a DualDisc completely conformed to the specifications set forth by the DVD Forum and DualDiscs have been cleared to use the DVD logo.

==Hopes for DualDisc==
Record companies had two main hopes for DualDiscs; the first being that they would eventually replace CDs as the preferred media for purchase at music retailers, and the second that the inclusion of bonus DVD content at a price similar to a conventional CD would help to slow down online music piracy by giving consumers more incentive to buy their music through retailers.
Some titles such as &quot;Devils &amp; Dust&quot; by Bruce Springsteen and &quot;Straight Outta Lynwood&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic have been released in the United States exclusively as DualDiscs.

===Costs versus conventional CDs===
In the United States, the cost of a DualDisc at retail versus that of a conventional CD varied depending on the title but, on average, a DualDisc cost about $1.50 to $2.50 USD more than the same title on CD. Some DualDisc titles such as &quot;Mr. A-Z&quot; by Jason Mraz and &quot;In Your Honor&quot; by the Foo Fighters had enhanced packaging which increased the retail cost of the DualDisc version of the albums over their CD counterparts more than the average. There were also other factors which go into the additional costs such as production, marketing etc.

==Common DVD content==
What one finds on the DVD side of a DualDisc title will vary. Common content includes:
*The entire reprinted album (and possibly bonus material) in higher-quality stereophonic and/or surround sound.
*Documentaries
*Music videos
*The artist&#x27;s discography
*A link to the artist&#x27;s website
*There are sometimes film-and-soundtrack DualDiscs.

===Audio types===
The CD side of a DualDisc contained standard 16-bit LPCM audio sampled at 44.1 kHz. On the DVD side, most record companies (with the notable exception of Sony Music: see below) provided the album&#x27;s music in both high-resolution, 24-bit DVD-Audio (typically at a sample rate of 96 or 192 kHz for stereo and 48 or 96 kHz for surround sound) and lower-resolution, 16-bit Dolby Digital sound (typically sampled at 48 kHz). This was done to allow consumers with DVD-Audio players access to very high-resolution stereophonic and/or surround sound versions of the album, while also providing the lower-resolution Dolby Digital stereophonic and/or surround sound which is compatible with any DVD player.

====Sony====
Because Sony had an existing high-resolution audio format, SACD, in the marketplace which directly competes with DVD-Audio (see next section), Sony Music, as a general rule, only provided 16-bit, 48 kHz sampled LPCM stereophonic (and sometimes Dolby Digital Surround) sound on the DVD side of their DualDiscs. The sound was compatible with any DVD player; however, it does not provide the higher fidelity and resolution of 24-bit, high sample-rate DVD-Audio.

In addition, several SonyBMG titles whose regular editions include copy protection programs (such as XCP and SunnComm) did not feature the software on the DualDisc versions.

==Competition==

The biggest competition to DualDisc was the hybrid Super Audio CD (SACD), which was developed by Sony and Philips Electronics, the same companies that created the standard CD. DualDiscs and hybrid SACDs were competing solutions to the problem of providing higher-resolution audio on a disc that can still be played on conventional CD players.

DualDiscs took the approach of using a double-sided disc to provide the necessary backwards compatibility; hybrid SACDs are a one-sided solution that instead use two layers: a conventional CD layer and a high-resolution layer.

Hybrid SACDs claim a higher compatibility rate with conventional CD players than DualDisc, because hybrid SACDs conform to Red Book standards. However, a SACD or SACD-capable DVD player is required to take advantage of the enhanced SACD layer. With a DualDisc, consumers could use their existing DVD player to hear surround mixes. (DVD-Audio capable players are required for higher-resolution audio, if present.) In 2005, it was estimated that 75% of households in the United States have at least one DVD player.

==Criticism==

===Manufacturer warnings===
A number of electronics companies such as Lexicon, Marantz, Mark Levinson, Onkyo, Panasonic, Pioneer, and Sony (both its Computer Entertainment and Electronics divisions) issued statements warning consumers about possible problems with playing DualDisc titles on their equipment.

===Legal controversy===
There was some controversy surrounding the DualDisc format, as Dieter Dierks, the inventor of the DVDplus specification, claimed that DualDisc technology is in violation of his European patents.

<text>Johan Alexander Santana Araque (; born March 13, 1979) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball starting pitcher. Santana pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins from 2000 to 2007 and for the New York Mets from 2008 to 2012. A two-time Cy Young Award winner with the Twins, Santana is a four-time All-Star and earned a pitching triple crown in 2006. On June 1, 2012, Santana pitched the first no-hitter in New York Mets history against the St. Louis Cardinals.

==Professional career==
Santana was discovered in 1994 by Andres Reiner, who was a scout working for the Houston Astros at the time. Santana&#x27;s parents agreed to let him attend Houston&#x27;s academy in Valencia. When Astros scouting director Dan O&#x27;Brien called Reiner and asked if he had signed Santana to a contract, Reiner reported that he was still deciding if Santana was a better prospect as an outfielder or a pitcher. After six weeks of training, Santana was told he was going to pitch. Santana did not like it and almost left, but Reiner convinced him to stay. While originally a center fielder, Santana was converted to a pitcher at the academy due to his arm speed. In 1999 he was named the Tovar Mérida Athlete of the Year.

=== Minnesota Twins ===
After the 1999 major league season, Santana was left unprotected by the Houston Astros and eligible in the Rule 5 draft. The Minnesota Twins had the first pick that year, the Florida Marlins had the second. The Twins made a deal with the Marlins: the Twins would draft Jared Camp with their first pick and the Marlins would draft Santana. The teams would exchange the two players with the Twins receiving $50,000 to cover their pick.

Santana made his Major League debut with the Twins on April 3, 2000, coming from the bullpen vs. Tampa Bay. He made his first MLB start on April 7, 2000, at Kansas City and recorded his first Major League win in a relief appearance at Houston on June 6. He put up a 6.49 ERA in 86 innings pitched in 2000, his rookie year.

In 2002, the Twins sent Santana to the minors for 2 months to work almost exclusively on perfecting his changeup. He did this for 10 starts and came back up to the majors with a terrific changeup to complement his very good fastball. While in the minors, pitching coach Bobby Cuellar made Santana throw at least one changeup to every batter. According to Cuellar, Santana would sometimes throw 20 in a row during games.

Santana was used as a long reliever early in his career after finding little success as a starter. In 2002, he led the majors in wild pitches, with 15.

In 2003, Santana transitioned from relief to the Twins&#x27; starting rotation after spending the first four months of the season in the bullpen. He won his last eight decisions and pitched the ALDS opening game against the Yankees.

Due to Santana&#x27;s early major-league success with the Twins, a young minor-league pitcher in the Anaheim Angels&#x27; farm system also named Johan Santana changed his name to Ervin Santana in 2003; he also achieved major league success. Santana underwent minor elbow surgery following the season.

====2004 season====
In , Santana had one of the great second half performances of the modern era. He became the first pitcher since 1961 to give up four or fewer hits in 10 straight starts, and his 13–0 record broke the old Major League second-half mark shared between Burt Hooton and Rick Sutcliffe.

Santana&#x27;s other second-half numbers were equally impressive: 11.13 strikeouts per nine innings, 1.21 ERA, 4.74 hits per nine innings, and 6.73 baserunners per nine innings. In addition, Santana set a team season record with 265 strikeouts, surpassing the old 258 mark registered by Bert Blyleven in 1973.

Santana finished in good form with a 20–6 record and led the American League (AL) in strikeouts (265), ERA (2.61), strikeouts per nine innings pitched (10.46), WHIP (0.92), batting average allowed (.192), OBP (.249), SLG (.315), and OPS (.564) and walked only 54 batters in 228 innings. Opponents stole just six bases in seven attempts against him, and his 20 victories ranked him second behind only Curt Schilling&#x27;s 21. He easily won the AL Cy Young Award with all 28 first-place votes.

====2005 season====
Santana struggled in his first outing of 2005, giving up four runs in the first inning, but quickly regained his composure and returned to Cy Young-winning form in an 8–4 victory over the Seattle Mariners. In his second game, he recorded 11 strikeouts against the Chicago White Sox as the Twins won 5–2. Santana finished the season with an ERA of 2.87, second-lowest in the AL behind Indians pitcher Kevin Millwood (2.86). However, the weak Twins club of the 2005 season cost him several otherwise-winnable games, and his winning percentage fell considerably in his second full year as a starter. He threw 238 strikeouts during the season, leading the majors, and finished third in the Cy Young voting, finishing behind winner Bartolo Colón and closer Mariano Rivera.

====2006 season====

Santana won the pitching Major League Triple Crown, the first pitcher to do so since Dwight Gooden in . He completed the season leading the majors in ERA (2.77) and strikeouts (245), and tied Chien-Ming Wang in wins (19). He became the first pitcher to win the triple crown with fewer than 20 wins, and the first to win it with an ERA above 2.60.

Santana also led the AL in WHIP (1.00), opposing batting average (.216), and innings pitched (233.2). He continued to add to his reputation as a great second-half pitcher, losing only one game after the All-Star break while winning 10 and posting a 2.54 ERA. A brief slump cost him the opportunity to make his 20th win of the season. No pitcher in Major League Baseball won 20 games in the 2006 season, the first time in modern major league history this occurred.

Santana won his second Cy Young Award in 2006, becoming the 14th player in MLB history to win the award multiple times. He became the fifth pitcher to win the award by a unanimous vote multiple times, joining Roger Clemens, Pedro Martínez, Greg Maddux and Sandy Koufax, who accomplished the feat three times.

From 2004 to 2006, Santana led the league in strikeouts all three years, in ERA twice, and also led in several other key statistical areas. In this three-year span, he compiled a 55–19 record with an ERA of 2.75 and WHIP of 0.96, while striking out 748 batters.

====2007 season====
After a slow start, with his record falling to 6–6 at one point, Santana jump-started his season with a four-hit shutout, followed by two wins. On July 1, , Santana was named as a member of the 2007 All-Star Game, his third straight appearance. On June 19, 2007, on the team bus to a game at Shea Stadium, Bert Blyleven said he would have his head shaved if that night&#x27;s starting pitcher, Santana, threw a complete-game shutout. The Twins won, 9–0, and Santana went the distance on a four-hitter. Santana shaved Blyleven&#x27;s head the following day. Santana had perhaps his best career game on August 19 against the Texas Rangers in which he struck out 17 batters over eight innings. He walked none and allowed only two hits, both to Sammy Sosa. His 17 strikeouts set a Twins club record for strikeouts in a game. Santana&#x27;s game score of 95 is the highest by any pitcher in MLB history in a non-complete game.

He led the major leagues in home runs allowed (33) and had the most losses of his career (13). Santana finished the season with only 15 wins, his lowest total since 2003. However, Santana led the AL in WHIP, was second in strikeouts with 235, and seventh in ERA. In the last game of the season, a rain delay in a road game against the Detroit Tigers that lasted over an hour caused Santana to pitch only three innings. This ended a 123 consecutive start streak in which he pitched five innings or more. This is the third-longest consecutive-game streak for a pitcher in the past half-century. In November, it was announced Santana was awarded the AL Gold Glove Award for pitcher, his first selection. He was also honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding pitcher in MLB, and finished 5th in the AL Cy Young Award voting.

===New York Mets===

====2008 season====
On February 2, 2008, Santana was traded from the Twins to the New York Mets for Carlos Gómez, Philip Humber, Deolis Guerra, and Kevin Mulvey. The Mets and Santana agreed to a six-year, $137.5 million contract. Santana was named the Opening Day starter, throwing 100 pitches in seven innings to earn the win against the Florida Marlins. On May 10, 2008, he earned his first win at Shea Stadium as a member of the New York Mets.

On June 1, 2008, Santana earned his 100th career victory, going 7.2 innings and allowing one run in a 6–1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.

On July 27, the day after the Mets played a 14-inning game where every pitcher in the bullpen was used, Johan pitched a complete game, striking out five and getting his first RBI as a Met against the St. Louis Cardinals, improving his record to 9–7. On August 17, 2008, Santana pitched his second complete game for his 11th win of the season, allowing only three hits while walking none and striking out 7 in a 3–0 Mets shutout over the Pittsburgh Pirates.

On September 23, Santana threw 125 pitches, a career-high to that point, in eight innings to beat the Chicago Cubs. On September 27, in the thick of a playoff race and on the final weekend of the season, Santana pitched a complete three-hit gem in a 2–0 win against the Florida Marlins on three days&#x27; rest. It was later revealed that Santana had pitched that day, and perhaps in many other starts, with a torn meniscus in his left knee, for which he underwent successful surgery on October 1, 2008.

Santana finished the 2008 regular season with a 16–7 record, posting a 2.53 ERA with 206 strikeouts, which set a Mets&#x27; single-season record for strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher, breaking Jon Matlack&#x27;s 35-year record of 205 in . His 2.53 ERA led the majors and was a career-best. He also set a career-high in innings pitched and was undefeated in the second half of the season. However, he was also the victim of seven blown saves, tying for first in the majors.

Santana finished in third place in the NL Cy Young Award race behind Brandon Webb and winner Tim Lincecum.

====2009 season====
On April 7, 2009, Johan Santana started the first game for the New York Mets in the 2009 season against the Cincinnati Reds. He went 5.2 innings allowing only one earned run, going on to win. In his second start on April 12, Santana struck out 13 batters and surrendered two unearned runs over seven innings against the Florida Marlins only to lose for the first time since June 28, 2008, against the New York Yankees. On August 25 Santana was placed on the 15-day disabled list and missed the remainder of the season after having to undergo season-ending arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his left elbow. Santana finished the season at a record of 13–9 with a 3.13 ERA.

In 2009, he was ranked number 3 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, behind Albert Pujols and Alex Rodriguez. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.

====2010 season====
In a start on May 2, 2010, against Philadelphia, Santana gave up 10 runs in 3 innings, the worst start in his MLB career, surpassing his previous worst start on June 14, 2009, versus the Yankees, where he allowed nine runs and nine hits in just three innings. However, in the next five starts after that, Santana gave up only seven earned runs, striking out 21 and improving his record to 4–2 with a 3.03 ERA. On July 6, Santana hit his first major league home run off of Matt Maloney of the Cincinnati Reds, which provided the Mets with their first run, and pitched a complete-game shutout to earn the win. From July 1 – 23, Santana was 3–0 with a 0.71 ERA in five starts. Santana, who was struggling to keep his 10–9 record through September 2, strained his pectoral muscle in a 65 pitch start versus Atlanta, for the second time in his career. His last game of the season was a win against the Atlanta Braves on September 2. On September 14, he underwent surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his left shoulder. Santana ended his season with a record of 11–9 and an ERA of 2.98. This was the third consecutive year that Johan had gotten injured.

====2011 season====
Johan Santana missed the entire 2011 major league season while he recovered from anterior capsule surgery to his left shoulder (dominant), pitching only in the minors.

====2012 season====

On April 5, 2012, Santana was tabbed as the Mets Opening Day starter. This marked the first time Santana pitched in the majors since September 2, 2010, when he tore the anterior capsule in his left shoulder. He went five scoreless innings against the Atlanta Braves, striking out five batters. On May 26, Santana pitched a complete game shut-out against the San Diego Padres, the ninth of his career. He struck out seven over nine innings and improved to 2–2 with a 2.75 ERA over his first 10 starts. On June 30, in Dodger Stadium, he scattered three hits over eight shutout innings. After three more starts, on July 21, Santana was placed on the 15-day disabled list by the Mets after spraining his right ankle. Santana was again put on the 15-day disabled list with inflammation in his lower back on August 22. He did not pitch for the remainder of the 2012 season. Santana finished the season 6–9 with a 4.85 ERA and 111 strikeouts in 21 starts and 117 innings pitched.

=====No-hitter=====
On June 1, in only the 11th start since returning from shoulder surgery, Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals, the defending World Series champions. This was the first no-hitter in Mets franchise history, coming in their 51st season and 8,020th regular-season game. It marked only the eighth no-hitter in MLB history against a defending World Series champion team, the first since former Met Nolan Ryan blanked the Oakland Athletics in 1990. Santana walked five batters, recorded eight strikeouts, and lowered his season ERA to 2.38. He also threw a career-high 134 pitches. Notable moments in the game included a liner in the sixth inning by former Met Carlos Beltrán, which hit the foul line behind third base but was ruled foul. In the seventh inning, Mike Baxter made a difficult catch in left field, preserving the no-hitter, and then violently crashed into the wall. He left the game with a bruised left shoulder and was subsequently placed on the DL.

For throwing the no-hitter, Santana was named National League Player of the Week for the week ending June 3, 2012. It was his fifth such award and followed his teammate R. A. Dickey who won it the prior week. His pitching feat earned him the Key to the City, which was bestowed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

, Santana&#x27;s no-hitter is the only solo no-hitter by a Mets pitcher, although five Mets pitchers combined to no-hit the Philadelphia Phillies 3-0 on April 29, 2022.

====2013 season====
Santana tore his shoulder capsule for the second time during early 2013. Surgery was performed on April 3, 2013, by Dr. David Altchek. He missed the entire 2013 season. On November 1, 2013, the Mets bought out his 2014 option for $5.5 million, making Santana a free agent.

===Later career===
On March 4, 2014, Santana signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. The contract included an invitation to Major League spring training, and Santana was due to earn $3 million if he made the Major League roster. On June 6, Santana tore his Achilles tendon during an extended spring training start. He missed the rest of the 2014 MLB season.

On February 26, 2015, Santana signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. The contract would have paid him $2.5 million if he made the 25-man roster, and it included bonuses for active days and games started. Santana started the season on the disabled list of the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons while rehabbing the shoulder muscles in his throwing arm. On June 27, Santana announced that he was ending his 2015 season due to a toe infection and planned to resume his comeback in 2016.

==Pitching style==
Santana&#x27;s pitch repertoire included an 88–94 mph fastball along with a circle changeup, which was generally considered his best pitch, and a slider.

==Personal life==
Santana is the second of five children. He attended Jose Nucete Sardi High School, where he played center field. He and his wife, Yasmile, whom he has known since he was nine years old, have two daughters and a son. Santana missed the New York Mets&#x27; 2009 first regular-season game at Citi Field due to the birth of his son. He and his family reside in the Miromar Lakes community in Estero, Florida in Lee County.

As a child playing in Little League, Santana wanted to play shortstop until coaches told him he couldn&#x27;t play shortstop because he was a lefty. He then taught himself to throw right-handed so he could play shortstop.

In 2006, Santana founded The Johan Santana Foundation to provide assistance to hospitals. Also in 2006, Santana and the Minnesota Twins purchased a yellow fire truck for Tovar&#x27;s fire department. All proceeds from Johan&#x27;s charity wine, Santana&#x27;s Select, support his foundation. In 2012, the foundation contributed to Tuesday&#x27;s Children, an organization that helps families impacted by 9/11 and individuals who have lost loved ones to terrorism around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;5/30/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Santana was accused of sexual battery by a woman following an incident that took place on a golf course in Florida on October 28, 2009. No criminal charges were filed. Santana contended that he had a consensual sexual encounter with his accuser. Santana&#x27;s accuser later filed a civil lawsuit and Santana countersued, alleging extortion. The matter was settled out of court in November 2012.

Santana was elected to the Twins Hall of Fame in 2018 with a pregame ceremony held at Target Field on August 4.

<doc id="725488" wikidata="Q178724" url="?curid=725488" title="T. J. Hooker">
<text>T. J. Hooker is an American police drama television program starring William Shatner in the title role as a 15-year veteran police sergeant. The series premiered as a mid-season replacement on March 13, 1982, on ABC and ran on the network until May 4, 1985. The show was then picked up for a further single season by CBS.

The supporting cast includes Adrian Zmed as rookie Officer Vince Romano; April Clough as Officer Vicki Taylor (Season 1 only), replaced by Heather Locklear as rookie Officer Stacy Sheridan (season 2 onwards); and Richard Herd as Captain Dennis Sheridan, portraying officers in the LCPD Academy Precinct of a fictional, unnamed California city. Toward the end of the show&#x27;s second season, James Darren became a regular cast member as Officer Jim Corrigan.

==Plot==
The background of Sergeant Thomas Jefferson &quot;T. J.&quot; Hooker is that he, up until recently, was a plainclothes LCPD Detective Sergeant whose partner was killed in the line of duty while he and Hooker were trying to stop a bank robbery. An angry Hooker becomes motivated to rid the streets of criminals like those who murdered his partner. Thus, he decides the only way to do so is return to his former position as a uniformed patrolman. Hooker is a combat veteran of the Vietnam War, serving in U.S. Army Special Forces during the early years of the U.S.&#x27;s involvement in the war.

In &quot;The Protectors,&quot; the series&#x27; pilot/TV movie, Hooker, back in uniform, trains a group of police academy recruits, including those played by Richard Lawson, Brian Patrick Clarke, Kelly Harmon, and Adrian Zmed. Hal Williams plays a senior officer, and Richard Herd makes a brief appearance as Captain Dennis Sheridan, Hooker&#x27;s tough but understanding superior. During most of the series, Hooker is partnered with brash, sometimes hot-headed young rookie Vince Romano (played by Zmed). Romano is also a combat veteran of the Vietnam War, serving in the Army Infantry towards the end of U.S. ground forces involvement in the war. Hooker acts as his mentor both professionally and socially. The age difference generally being the key hook of the partnership, the pair quickly became fast friends and a good team.

Outside of his work, Hooker is divorced as a result of his work putting a strain on his marriage, but he is friendly with his ex-wife Fran, a nurse. A ladies&#x27; man, Hooker is still trying to adjust to being single again. Lee Bryant was the original actress to portray Fran; the part is later played by Leigh Christian.

Hooker&#x27;s tough, no-nonsense demeanor has him often clashing with station Captain Sheridan (Richard Herd), but he always got the job done and was highly respected as a result. Working behind the desk at the police precinct, Vicki Taylor (April Clough) is a female officer who continually dodges pick-up attempts by Vince Romano. Introduced at the start of the second season was attractive Officer Stacy Sheridan (Heather Locklear), the daughter of Captain Sheridan, who attended the police academy. Initially brought in to replace Vicki, by the end of the season she had progressed to patrolling with Jim Corrigan (James Darren), another veteran cop much in the mold of Hooker.

From the third season onward, Hooker and Romano (Unit 4-Adam-30), and Stacy and Corrigan (Unit 4-Adam-16), usually worked closely together to tackle cases. The addition of Corrigan and Sheridan&#x27;s partnership added an extra dimension to the show, sometimes with whole plots revolving around one or both of them.

For the final season, the series moved from ABC to a late-night slot on CBS. During the period between the show being cancelled by ABC and picked up by CBS, Adrian Zmed had accepted the job as host of Dance Fever and was unable to return for the final season, leaving Hooker to patrol alone or to generally work as more of a trio with Stacy and Jim, often on undercover work.

With its blend of humor mixed with &quot;on the streets&quot; grittiness, the show proved popular. The first season ranked 28th in the Nielsen ratings, but subsequent seasons failed to repeat the same level of success. The third season saw a slight revamp (including the theme music being rearranged into a more pop-driven version), with Corrigan set into place as Stacy&#x27;s partner, and Captain Sheridan being dropped into the background (appearing as &#x27;Special Guest Star&#x27; in just a few third and fourth-season episodes). The recurring character of Hooker&#x27;s new boss, Lieutenant Pete O&#x27;Brien, portrayed by Hugh Farrington, was added. Lt. O&#x27;Brien was a veteran detective who was wounded in the line of duty. The injuries put him in a wheelchair but he still worked complex investigations and supervised officers. The stories started drifting toward a more straightforward cops-and-robbers fare.

==Production==
===Background===
The series was created by Rick Husky who had also worked on &quot;The Rookies&quot; for Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. The series was originally to be a reworking of that former cop show, this time called &quot;The Protectors&quot;. After the pilot, it was decided to focus the series on William Shatner&#x27;s character and retitle it &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;. The series initially set out to give a more &quot;hands on&quot;, procedure-based view of police work than some of the more stylized cop shows of the 1970s and 1980s, evident in the very early episodes.

===Setting===
The LCPD Academy scenes were filmed at the Los Angeles Police Department Academy in Elysian Park. Though the series itself was produced in Burbank and filmed in the Los Angeles area, the setting was not disclosed throughout the show&#x27;s entire run.

Hooker and Romano&#x27;s radio call sign for their &quot;black and white&quot; was &quot;4-Adam-30&quot;, and radio calls were very similar to those of Los Angeles Police Department, using three bursts of a 900 Hz tone, using LAPD-type radio codes, and the officers acknowledging with &quot;roger&quot;.

===Vehicles===
In the first, second and up to the fourth episode of the third season, Hooker drove a &#x27;77-&#x27;78 Dodge Monaco police package, but afterwards he started driving a &#x27;79-&#x27;81 Dodge St. Regis, usually powered by the much more anemic 318 or 360 Cid V8 as opposed to the 440 Cid V8 Monaco. By the fourth season, when Hooker and his team needed an unmarked cruiser, they usually rolled around in a &#x27;82-&#x27;83 light blue Dodge Diplomat or a &#x27;77-&#x27;78 burgundy red Dodge Monaco. Hooker&#x27;s personal car for the duration of the series was a &#x27;74 blue Ford Torino sedan. Romano&#x27;s car was a gold 1983 Datsun 280ZX, Corrigan&#x27;s ride was a silver and red Jeep CJ-7 Laredo, and Stacy&#x27;s car was a blue 1983 Ford Mustang LX convertible.

&quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; was canceled by ABC in the summer of 1985 (the final episode was a proposed reworking of the series set in Chicago) but the series survived when CBS picked up the show for late night and produced 17 new episodes (still produced in Los Angeles) plus one two-hour TV movie for primetime titled &quot;Blood Sport&quot;. The new episodes were shown later at night as the first portion of the network&#x27;s &quot;CBS Late Night&quot; program block, with each episode&#x27;s runtime extended to 70 minutes (or one hour and ten minutes) to allow CBS affiliates time for increased availability for advertisements. The TV movie and the penultimate episode were both aired by CBS on May 21, 1986, with the finale one week later on May 28, 1986. The season was produced on a much smaller budget and reused action sequences from the previous seasons. A film adaptation, tentatively titled &quot;T.J. Hooker: The Movie&quot; is listed as being &quot;in development&quot;, according to IMDB.com.

==Episodes==
William Shatner is the only actor to appear in every episode of the series. Heather Locklear appeared in the second-highest number of episodes, appearing in 84 of the 90 episodes, after joining the cast&#x27;s second season.

==Broadcast==
===US and international syndication===
Starting in 2005, the A&amp;E Network re-broadcast the entire series, running one episode per weekday at 4:00 a.m. It is also available in a shortened format on The Minisode Network and full length episodes are available on Crackle. The Universal HD Channel started airing episodes in September 2010. On October 9, 2010, the Sleuth network began a 24-hour &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; marathon.
In September 2014, FamilyNet cable channel began carrying the series, which was remastered in the mid-2000s with a high definition version that originally aired on Universal HD. Around early 2017, the show aired on MeTV. On June 26, 2017, FETV began airing the series weeknights at 10:00 p.m until 2021. In 2023, the MeTV+ network began airing the program.

In the United Kingdom, the show was originally broadcast by ITV starting in April 1983. Most regions broadcast episodes at 7:45 p.m. on Saturday evenings, later in a similar Friday evening slot (usually 7:30 p.m). Some regions gave it a slot on a different day (southern region TVS, for example, typically ran it on Tuesday evenings), and not all regions broadcast the entire series, with some areas not progressing beyond the third or fourth seasons. Some regions also broadcast the later episodes - particularly those concerning a more adult or violent nature - as part of the night-time line-up during the advent of 24-hour broadcasting in the later 1980s. In 2002, Five ran the whole series through, in a weekday 11:00 a.m. slot. This run included every episode, although some were edited for content for the daytime slot. In 2009, digital channel Quest aired the series on a daily basis, although they only hold the rights to show the first three seasons. On 11 November 2019, series 1 began broadcasting on Sony Channel.

In Italy, the series started to air in 1983 on Canale 5. After his first run, it was often repeated through the years: first on Italia 1 (late afternoon or in the morning ) and then on Rete 4 (in the morning) and Fox Retro (in the evening). Recently, METOO a Sister station of WCIU-TV in Chicago began airing the show in a 2:00 p.m. timeslot.

In Japan, the series has been playing 1985 – 1988 on Nippon TV.

In Australia, the series has been playing reruns on the 7 Networks 3rd channel 7mate from 2012 to 2016.

In New Zealand, the series is being screened for the first time, as from May 13, 2013, on Sky Television&#x27;s Jones! channel.

As of 2019, the show has been re-run in the UK and Ireland by Sony Channel.

===High definition===
Beginning on October 1, 2010, the series was rebroadcast on Universal HD to overwhelming success, quickly becoming one of the most successful series on the channel although the channel did not yet subscribe to Nielsen ratings. Due to the high ratings, the original film elements were re-mastered for high definition, and the program was cropped to a 1.78 aspect ratio to fill the screens of modern televisions.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released the first two seasons on DVD in Region 1 and 2. Due to poor sales, no further seasons were released. This release has been discontinued and is out of print.

On August 27, 2013, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that it had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library, including &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;. It subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on April 1, 2014.

On April 5, 2017, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series and subsequently released &quot;T. J. Hooker – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on July 18, 2017.

<text>LLQP (Life Licence Qualification Program) is part of the Canadian licensing regime for life insurance sales people. Before an advisor in the financial services sector is allowed to begin selling life insurance products, they must complete and pass LLQP, and earn a certificate of completion. Once the certification exam is completed, and criminal records checks are submitted, applicants may apply to their provincial insurance council to write the licensing exam. Once the provincial exam is completed and passed, the applicant may complete the requirements to apply for a licence to sell life insurance, accident and sickness products, and life insurance related investment products like Segregated funds and annuities. The LLQP exam certificate is valid in all provinces and territories except Quebec, which uses a separate system altogether.

LLQP is an entry-level program. In order to become eligible to work for many companies, such as Freedom 55 and Sun Life, a candidate must first complete and pass the LLQP. Upon completion of the LLQP, it is possible for the candidate to apply to write the provincial certification exam, successful completion of which will allow the candidate to apply for a certificate (often known as a licence) to sell life insurance and related products, such as annuities and segregated funds. There are two versions of the LLQP: the &quot;full LLQP&quot; and the LLQP Accident &amp; Sickness (A&amp;S). The full version combines life insurance and accident and sickness insurance training. The A&amp;S version covers accident and sickness insurance only.

The LLQP does not provide a designation. It is simply the first hurdle toward earning a licence to practice.

Technically, most provincial insurance acts only prohibit somebody from acting as an agent if that person does not carry a licence to sell life insurance. Agent is defined as one who is financially rewarded for conducting said business.

==History==

Canadian Insurers experienced some financial difficulties through the late 1980s, continuing on into the 1990s. This was largely the result of declining interest rates on safe, income-producing investments such as bond and treasury bill, though this was not the only problem. This led to a wave of consolidation and demutualization amongst Canadian insurers, in an effort to raise capital and cut costs. Internally, many insurers, in an effort to cut costs, chose to eliminate their in-house sales forces. Almost all &#x27;career shops&#x27; ceased to exist during this time. There are a few major career shops remaining today, such as those run by Sun Life, Freedom 55, and IGM Financial.

When the career shop was the entry point of choice into the insurance industry, it was normal for new agents to undertake an intensive training program, usually involving a combination of in-house training, field training, and head office training. With the cost-cutting measures so prevalent through this period, it was still necessary for insurers to find ways to distribute their products. Many insurers switched to the insurance broker system. Under the brokerage system, a Managing general agent (MGA) takes on most of the responsibilities that once fell to the career shops. The difference, as far as the insurers were concerned, was in cost management. Instead of insurers tying up resources dealing with training and human resources management, this burden was now passed directly to the agents, through their MGAs.

For Canadian regulators, this led to some concerns. The Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR) and the Canadian Insurance Services Regulatory Organization(CISRO), together in 1997, determined that the decline of career shops and the subsequent move to the MGA system would hurt consumers. The problem that would arise would be that the process that was then in place that would allow a certificate to sell life insurance to be issued was expected to be complemented by an intensive training program. Most MGAs had neither the interest nor the resources to carry out such a program. As a result, CCIR and CISRO announced that there would be a more rigorous examination and study process for those entering into the life insurance industry. The feeling was that by enforcing higher educational standards at the beginning, new agents would enter into the industry better prepared.

CCIR and CISRO entered into a consultation period, during which time they enlisted the services of education professionals, industry input, and input from other regulatory bodies. They end result was the LLQP Design Document which listed specific educational objectives. The expectation is that every new life insurance agent should know these educational objectives. The educational objectives are based on [Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy|Taxonomy of Educational Objectives].

Once the Design Document was in place, the regulators created exams that students would have to pass in order to be able to apply for certification to sell insurance. The exam originally was a 140 question five-answer multiple choice exam, with a heavy orientation towards case-study style multiple choice questions. Students would be given three hours to complete this exam. This changed slightly, and examinees are now given four hours for 140 questions.

Concurrently, the regulators determined that they wanted to avoid a scenario which had happened in the days prior to the LLQP. Under previous regimes, candidates would sometimes write an exam, fail it, write the next week, and so forth, until they had learned the proper answers to all the questions in the exam. There are anecdotal stories of candidates writing the exam twelve or more times before succeeding. This is not a valid educational process; this candidate has learned the answers to the exam questions, but does not likely understand the underlying material. In order to prevent this, it was determined that, prior to challenging the provincial certification exam, any candidate would have to first be certified by an authorized education provider. Several existing education providers were approached to develop textbooks, seminars, and exam processes to validate students in preparation for the certification exam. The intent was to guarantee that any student writing the provincial exam would be well-prepared.

Starting January 1, 2003, anybody wishing to work as an insurance agent in the common law provinces had to write their certification exam. (There are exceptions, but these are so rarely applied that they should not even be considered.) Since that time, there have been some changes to the LLQP process, but it has largely stayed intact as originally envisioned.

In 2013, CISRO began to update the design document, with the intention of changing the exam process. The new exam regime will include 4 separate exams, each focussing on one area of required expertise.

==Study process==
A number of private companies offer LLQP training, both through online and in-class sessions. Insurance companies including Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, Combined Insurance Company of America, Canada Life Insurance Company and Primerica Life Insurance Company of Canada are also LLQP course providers.

Industry experts and professionals and course providers recommend a student spend between 80 and 120 hours studying for the LLQP exam.

Starting in 2016, CISRO will roll out the new standardized licensing regime across Canada (including Quebec). Educational companies, such as IFSE Institute, will begin offering programs to candidates that will accommodate the new modular exams.

==Exam process==

The LLQP Exam Process today incorporates four 35 question, multiple choice exams. Writers are given 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete each exam section. Note that bathroom breaks are not permitted for this exam. In most jurisdictions, exam writers complete a scantron sheet. There are regular exam writes hosted in major Canadian centres, and smaller centres generally have writes on a less frequent, or as-needed basis. For example, there are exam writes every second day in Toronto, while Calgary has a write every Monday. 

While the exam is based on identical content in all jurisdictions, there are some differences in how the exam is conducted from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In Saskatchewan, for example, it is necessary for a prospective agent to complete a bylaws exam concurrently with the certification exam. In most jurisdictions, a prospective agent can schedule an exam write either at any time - this is the case in British Columbia and [Ontario] - or upon completion of the exam offered by an LLQP provider, as is the case in Alberta. In [Manitoba], though, a prospective agent must have sponsorship from an insurer in place prior to being permitted to write the exam.

Upon completion of the exam, results are normally available very quickly, often the next day. The passing grade in all jurisdictions is 60%. A successful writer will be permitted to go on and apply for a life insurance certificate. An unsuccessful writer will be given two more attempts, for a total of three, and then required to wait six months before writing again. If that further attempt is unsuccessful, then the candidate must wait another six months, and so on.

Feedback from an unsuccessful write is generally not available. The insurance councils do not release old exam questions, nor do they indicate to candidates which questions were answered correctly and incorrectly. In some jurisdictions, it is possible to obtain a breakdown indicating, by topic, which areas a student was strong in, and where a student needs to improve.

The Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators (CCIR) maintains an LLQP provider results list that outlines each provider, exam type, number of exams written and pass rate.

Upon completion of the exam, there is no designation granted. Completion of this process simply allows somebody to apply for a certificate to work as an insurance agent. Application is done through the licensing regulatory body for the specific province.

==Results of the LLQP process==

The LLQP process initially came under, and sometimes is still subject to, criticism. It was criticized for making entry into the insurance industry too challenging, and there was a fear that recruiting by insurers and managing general agents would suffer. While there are some who are still critical of the LLQP, statistics maintained by provincial insurance regulators indicate that renewal rates for licenses sit at approximately 94% year over year, a significant improvement as compared to the pre-LLQP era, when renewal rates were typically around 85% year over year. The system stands overhauled jan 2016.

<text>Leisnig (, ) is a small town in the district of Mittelsachsen, in the free state of Saxony in Germany, 50 kilometers southeast of Leipzig.

==History==
A settlement in this location was first mentioned in 1046. The town features Mildenstein Castle which is over 1000 years old. The house Markt 13 shows the coat of arms of the Apian family.

Leisnig was Friedrich Olbricht&#x27;s birthplace. In 1944, he was involved in the 20 July Plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, and was executed for his participation in it.

The former municipality Bockelwitz became a part of the town of Leisnig in 2012.

==Points of interest==
* Arktisch-Alpiner Pflanzengarten und Alpine Staudengärtnerei, a botanical garden
* Mildenstein Castle

=== Museums ===
The museum at Mildenstein Castle was founded in 1890 by the Leisnig Historical and Antiquarian Society. In addition to an exhibition on the history of the castle, which includes important finds such as Bohemian glasses from the 14th century, there are also newly established exhibitions on the penal system and the Leisnig office. In the boot museum on the outer bailey, inaugurated in 2006, the town&#x27;s landmark, the Leisnig Giant Boot, is exhibited. In the town hall a small gallery is maintained with exhibitions that change several times a year.

<text>The Plymouth Valiant (first appearing in 1959 as simply the Valiant) is an automobile which was marketed by the Plymouth division of the Chrysler Corporation in the United States from the model years of 1960 through 1976. It was created to give the company an entry in the compact car market emerging in the late 1950s. The Valiant was also built and marketed, without the Plymouth brand, worldwide in countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Finland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as other countries in South America and Western Europe. It became well known for its excellent durability and reliability, and was one of Chrysler&#x27;s best-selling automobiles during the 1960s and 1970s, helping to keep the company solvent during an economic downturn.

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine considered the Valiant to be &quot;one of the best all-around domestic cars&quot;.

==First generation (1960–1962)==

In May 1957, Chrysler president Lester Lum &quot;Tex&quot; Colbert established a committee to develop a competitor in the burgeoning compact car market which included the popular VW Beetle, the new American Motors Rambler and upcoming entries from GM, Ford and Studebaker. Design chief Virgil Exner created a car that was smaller and lighter than a full-size car without sacrificing passenger and luggage space. Originally named the &quot;Falcon&quot; after Exner&#x27;s 1955 Chrysler Falcon concept car, the vehicle was renamed the &quot;Valiant&quot; (which means &quot;having or showing courage or valor&quot;) honoring Henry Ford II&#x27;s request to use the name for the Ford Falcon. The Valiant debuted at the 44th British International Motor Show in London on October 26, 1959. It was introduced as a 1960 model and was officially considered a distinct brand, advertised with the tagline &quot;Nobody&#x27;s kid brother, this one stands on its own four tires.&quot; For the 1961 model year, the Valiant was classified as a Plymouth model. The 1961–62 Dodge Lancer was essentially a rebadged Valiant with different trim and styling details. For the 1962 model year, the Valiant returned without Plymouth branding but was sold only in Plymouth Chrysler, Chrysler Dodge, or the rare standalone Plymouth dealerships. For model year 1964 and onwards the car was sold in the United States only as a Plymouth Valiant.

The Valiant was less radical in configuration than General Motors&#x27; compact Chevrolet Corvair, which had an air-cooled rear-mounted engine, but was considered more aesthetically daring than the also-new Falcon and Studebaker Lark compacts, which had more conventional looks; the Valiant boasted a radical design that continued Exner&#x27;s &quot;Forward Look&quot; styling with &quot;sleek, crisp lines which flow forward in a dart or wedge shape&quot;. The flush-sided appearance was a carried-over feature from Chrysler&#x27;s Ghia-built D&#x27;Elegance and Adventure concept cars which also gave the Valiant additional inches of interior room. The Valiant&#x27;s styling was new, yet with specific design elements that tied it to other contemporary Chrysler products, such as the canted tailfins tipped with cat&#x27;s-eye shaped tail lamps and the simulated Continental spare tire pressed into the trunk lid that were thematically similar to those on the Imperial and the 300F. According to Exner, the stamped wheel design was used not only to establish identity with other Chryslers, but to &quot;dress up the rear deck area without detracting from the look of directed forward motion&quot;.

The Valiant debuted an all-new six-cylinder overhead-valve engine, the famous slant-six. Its inline cylinders were uniquely canted 30° to the right (passenger side), permitting a lower hoodline. The water pump was shifted from front to alongside, shortening engine length. And an efficient long-branch individual-runner intake manifold was fitted, an advance that benefited from Chrysler&#x27;s pioneering work in tuned intakes. The slant-six produced both more power and better economy than similar American made economy straight sixes, and it soon gained a reputation for dependability. Project engineer Willem Weertman and his team had designed a simple yet robust workhorse, from its four-main forged crankshaft to a simplified &quot;mechanical&quot; valve train. Block and head castings were unusually thick because both were intended to be cast in either iron or aluminum with the same tooling. Although volume casting techniques of the era could not yet reliably produce complex head castings in aluminum, over 50,000 die-cast aluminum-block versions of the engine were produced between late 1961 and early 1963 and sold as extra-cost options.

The 1960 Valiant exemplified Chrysler&#x27;s leadership in aluminum die casting. While the aluminum slant-six engine block did not enter production until 1961, the Kokomo, Indiana, foundry produced a number of other aluminum parts for the 1960 Valiant, all instrumental in reducing the total weight of the car. The 1960 model contained as much as of aluminum in structural and decorative forms, with the majority of the material used in cast form as chassis parts. These parts included the oil pump, water pump, alternator housing, Hyper-Pak (see below) and standard production intake manifolds, all-new Torqueflite A-904 automatic transmission case and tail extension, and numerous other small parts. These cast-aluminum parts were roughly 60% lighter than corresponding parts of cast iron. A cast aluminum part had the benefit of reduced section thickness where strength was not a vital consideration. Section thickness of cast-iron parts were often dictated by casting practice, which required at least to ensure good castings. Exterior decorative parts stamped from aluminum were lighter than similar chromium-plated zinc castings. The entire grille and surrounding molding on the Valiant weighed only . If this same assembly had been made of die-cast zinc, as many grilles of the era were, it would have weighed an estimated . An estimated —about 4% of a Valiant&#x27;s total shipping weight—was saved with the of aluminum parts.

The Valiant A-body platform used &quot;unit-body&quot; or &quot;unibody&quot; construction (not used by the Chrysler Corporation since the Airflow models of the 1930s) rather than &quot;body-on-frame&quot; construction. Instead of a bolted-in forestructure used in other unibody designs, the Valiant incorporated a welded-in front understructure and stressed front sheet metal. The fenders, quarter panels, floor and roof contributed to the stiffness of the body shell. A unit wheelbase comparison showed the Valiant to be 95% stiffer in torsion and 50% stiffer in beam than a 1959 Plymouth with separate body-on-frame construction. Dynamic testing showed that high structural resonant frequencies were attained, indicating greater damping and reduced body shake.

The front suspension consisted of unequal length control arms with torsion bars, while the rear suspension used a live axle supported by asymmetric leaf springs. Chrysler used this design through the entire production of the Valiant and other A-body models, with revisions to the suspension components themselves for the 1962, 1967, 1968, and 1973 models.

===Hyper-Pak===
Plymouth product planning director Jack Charipar gave impetus for a stock car racing version of the Valiant, and while Chrysler engineers developed the Hyper-Pak for the track, the Hyper-Pak dealer tuning kit option was made available in limited quantities on December 1, 1959. Features included of torque, a 10.5:1 compression ratio, dual exhaust pipes on a single muffler, a manual choke and a larger fuel tank. Dick Maxwell, a Chrysler engineer responsible for many of the super stock Mopars, recalls that &quot;When NASCAR decided to run a compact road race in conjunction with the 1960 Daytona 500, all the factories got involved. We built a fleet of seven Hyper Pak Valiants with 148-hp 170-ci [Slant] sixes having a single four-barrel with ram manifold.&quot; The race Hyper-Paks also featured high-load valve springs and long-duration, high-lift camshafts.

NASCAR&#x27;s new compact car category debuted at the Daytona International Speedway on January 31, 1960. The first of two races was a road course, which used a portion of the high-banked tri-oval together with a twisting infield road for a lap distance of . The race length was 10 laps, . Averaging a speed of , Marvin Panch drove his Hyper-Pak into first place; all the Hyper-Paks swept the field taking the first seven places. The second race of the day used only the tri-oval track, 20 laps on its full length totaling . A multi-car accident on the fourth lap took out the four Valiant leaders including one driven by Richard Petty. Panch was not among them because car trouble delayed his start and he was busy passing slower cars from the rear of the field when the leaders crashed. After a restart, Panch worked to first place and stayed there, averaging a speed of . The remaining Valiants placed 1-2-3 and Panch again went into the winner&#x27;s circle. Maxwell again recalls that &quot;It was a Plymouth runway. We finished first through seventh. Our cars were so fast, NASCAR never did that race again.&quot;

===Station Wagon===

The Valiant station wagons had of cargo space yet required two feet less parking space than a full-size Plymouth. A locking luggage compartment on the two-seat models included the use of &quot;Captive-Aire&quot; (run-flat) tires. The compartment, located in the cargo deck, served as a spare tire storage space for models equipped with standard tires in which case the lock was optional. Captive-Aire tires, which did not require a spare, were standard equipment on the three-seat models. An aluminum tailgate window screen was available for the exclusion of insects when on vacation and camping trips.

The four-door station wagon, assembled only at the Dodge main plant in Hamtramck, was available in &quot;V100&quot; and &quot;V200&quot; trim in two- and three-seat configurations; the third seat faced the rear. Both models were the lowest priced four-door station wagons in America. The two-seat model was $60 under both the four-door Lark and Rambler station wagons, and the three-seater was $186 below the Rambler four-door.

===Design and mechanical revisions===
The first-generation Valiants, though sold in three model years, existed in &quot;four&quot; distinct configurations: early 1960, late 1960, 1961, and 1962. The base-model V100 cars received relatively minimal ornamentation.

====1960====

Early 1960 models, particularly the V200 high-trim cars, featured extensive brightwork and ornamentation. An chrome spear atop each front fender, an &quot;inner&quot; reveal ring on the deck lid&#x27;s spare tire stamping, a &quot;V200&quot; nameplate on the dashboard, and stainless steel windshield and backlight reveal moldings, which were deleted from production, replaced with less costly flexible mylar-faced plastic locking strips—in approximately January, 1960. Early and late V200s had a continuous stainless steel molding following the tailfin crease as it swept down in front of the rear wheel, then continuing forward along the lower break line in both doors and the front fender. The radiator grille was brite-dipped stamped aluminum, and a central grille badge doubled as the hood release. Script &quot;Valiant&quot; callouts were placed in the center of the deck lid&#x27;s spare-tire stamping and on each front fender.

During the 1960 model year, there were revisions to improve lubrication of the two rear connecting rods, voltage regulator function, cold starting and idling, acceleration, and to prevent breakage of the front and rear manifold mounting studs.

====1961====

For 1961, new two-door sedan and hardtop models were released, but no changes were made to the four-door sedan and wagon sheet metal. The interior and exterior trim were changed to provide model year differentiation, a mild form of planned obsolescence. The radiator grille stamping was the same as in 1960, but for 1961 it was painted with a pattern of black squares. The central grille ornament was still pulled from the bottom to release the hood, but it was now faced with an emblem having a white field with the blue-and-red stylized &quot;V&quot; logo, rather than 1960&#x27;s red placard with a gold script reading &quot;Valiant&quot;. The side trim was changed; a stainless spear was placed at the rear of each tailfin crease, a hockey stick-shaped trim was applied to the lower break line, and the front fender/door crease was capped with a long stainless spear. The tailfins were each topped with three transverse chrome strips, and a large horizontal emblem containing a round plastic &quot;V200&quot; callout was centered in the deck lid&#x27;s spare-tire stamping. Matching round &quot;V200&quot; callouts were placed in round housings at the midpoint of the front fender spears. Inside the car, the instrument cluster was largely carried over, but 1960&#x27;s black gauges with white callouts gave way to 1961&#x27;s white gauges with black callouts. For the first time, Valiants wore &quot;Plymouth&quot; script just left of the right-side taillight.

Mechanical revisions for 1961 included new carburetors, the availability of positive crankcase ventilation (which was newly mandated on cars sold in California), the availability of dealer-installed air conditioning, the relocation of the alternator from the left to the right side of the engine, and extensive revisions throughout most of the Valiant&#x27;s systems and components. Late in the 1961 model year, the larger slant-six engine became available in the Valiant, its use having been expanded earlier in the year from the larger Dodges and Plymouths to the Valiant-sized Dodge Lancer.

====1962====
The 1962 model year saw an extensive facelift. The radiator grille was flattened and shortened. The hood release was moved to a knob at the top of the grille frame. The central grille emblem was deleted, except on the top-line &quot;Signet 200&quot; two-door hardtop model, which received a black-painted grille with a round central emblem incorporating the red-and-blue stylized &quot;V&quot; Valiant emblem. The Signet 200 had pleated, leather-like bucket seats, custom tailored interior trim, deep-pile carpeting, special trunk lid emblem, different headlamp frames and special side moldings; it was America&#x27;s lowest-priced hardtop with bucket seats.
Fender and hood stampings were similar to the 1960-61 items, but neither identical nor interchangeable. At the rear, the cat&#x27;s-eye tail lamps were deleted. A wraparound stainless trim was applied to the tailfins, below which were placed round tail lamps set into stamped aluminum bezels. These occupied the space formerly available for optional backup lamps, which for 1962 flanked the license plate below the rear bumper. The spare-tire stamping was eliminated from the deck lid, which was now a smooth stamping with a small central ridge at its trailing edge. On V200 deck lids, a large round emblem surrounded an oblong block-letter &quot;Valiant&quot; callout on a black field. Similar block-letter/black-field callouts were placed on each front fender. On the Signet, the deck lid was adorned with a smaller round emblem surrounding the red-and-blue stylized &quot;V&quot; logo. The &quot;Plymouth&quot; script disappeared from the 1962 Valiant, as in 1960.

V200 side trim reverted to the 1960 concept, following the tailfin crease and lower body break crease. However, the 1962 trim was more massive and contained an oblong triple-window effect at the rear of the body break crease. On Signets, the front fenders had an open-centered double spear, connected at the front and back, within which was contained a secondary body paint color.
The 1962 Valiant was given a completely new asymmetric instrument cluster. Like that of the larger 1962 Plymouth models, the new Valiant cluster was highly regarded for its clean design and easy readability. A large round speedometer was placed at the left of the cluster, with separate round gauges for fuel level, engine temperature, and charging system condition (amperes) in a row to the right of the speedometer. Automatic transmission pushbuttons were in a column at the left edge of the panel, and heater pushbuttons were in a column at the right edge. A new shallower-dish steering wheel was also introduced.

Mechanical revisions for 1962 were extensive. The electrical system was extensively upgraded, with a new gear-reduction starter, new alternator, more fuses, and printed circuit boards rather than individual wires for the instrument cluster. Carburetors were improved again, the manual transmission gearshift was moved from the floor to the steering column, there were new 45°-shear engine mounts replacing the previous vertical-shear items, exhaust systems were made of more corrosion-resistant (aluminized) materials, and axle ratios were altered for better fuel economy. Manual steering ratio was changed from 20:1 to 24:1, and both power and manual steering gearboxes were new, the latter now housed in aluminum rather than iron. Most of the front suspension components were redesigned (now with balloon seals, an industry first), and it was claimed they needed lubrication only every .

===Accolade===
In October 1961, the Society of Illustrators presented Exner the 1962 Styling Award for outstanding design of the 1962 Signet 200; the award lauded Exner&#x27;s &quot;creative sculpted design&quot; of the Valiant, &quot;an automobile of outstanding originality, restraint and spirited beauty&quot;.

==Second generation (1963–1966)==
The Valiant was totally reskinned for 1963 with a shorter wheelbase; it had a wide, flat hood and a flat square rear deck. The upper belt feature line ran from the rear body, in a gentle sweep, to the front fender tip. Here it was &quot;veed&quot; back and down to the trailing edge of the front fender. The roofline was flatter and sharpened in profile. The grille was a variation of the inverted trapezoid shape that characterized contemporary Chryslers, with a fine mesh insert. Advances in body structure, many accessories and a new spring-staged choke were promotional highlights. The Valiant was offered as a two-door hardtop and convertible, a two- or four-door sedan, and a four-door station wagon. The hardtop and the convertible, with manual- or optional power-operated top, were offered only in the high V200 and premium Signet trim levels. The optional slant-six engine was initially offered with the die-cast aluminum block introduced in late 1961, but early in the 1963 model year the aluminum block was discontinued; both the 170 and 225 engines were thenceforth available only with iron blocks. In December 1962, Plymouth&#x27;s first-ever vinyl-covered roof became available as an option on the Signet. The 1963 Valiant was much better received by the public, and sales for the year rose to 225,056. The Valiant was sold in Mexico as a &quot;Chrysler Valiant&quot; starting with the 1963 model year. This was also the first year that it was coupled with the Dodge Dart, which had been previously a lower-end full-size model. In the U.S., the Valiant finally joined the Plymouth brand for the rest of its production.

Building on a worldwide record sales success in 1963, the Valiant moved into 1964 with design changes giving better economy, reliability and performance. Changes in the 1964 Valiant included a restyled front end featuring a new grille with a horizontal bars. A &quot;Valiant&quot; medallion was placed at the center of the grille where the bars formed a flat bulge. Vertical taillamps replaced the previous horizontal items. The ring-style rear deck decoration was replaced with a Valiant script located at the right-hand corner. There were few styling changes in the 1965 Valiants, but the 1966 Valiants had
significant superficial changes: a split grille with fine-patterned insert; new front fenders; new rear fenders on the sedans; new bevelled-edge rear deck lid; heavier rear bumper; and a new roofline with large rear window.

The new Chrysler-built A833 four-speed manual transmission was offered together with a Hurst shifter. Another new option was the &quot;Sure-Grip&quot; limited slip differential, which was touted as a bad-weather safety feature and also offered traction benefits in performance driving.

The Valiant was extremely popular in the US, Canada, and numerous markets outside North America. Plymouth supported a successful team of Valiant two-door sedans in the 1965 and 1966 SCCA Manufacturers Rally Championships.

===V8 engine===
In mid-1964, Chrysler released an all-new V8 engine as optional equipment in all Valiants. This compact V8 engine, with solid tappets, the first in Chrysler&#x27;s LA engine range and that would last until 2002, was specifically engineered to fit in the compact A-body engine compartment. Valiants with the optional 273 engine came with V-shaped emblems at the sides of the cowl. With the 273, the Valiant became the lowest-priced V-8 automobile in the world. For 1965, a hotter version of the 273 called the &quot;Commando 273&quot; was made available with 10.5:1 compression, a four-barrel carburetor, performance camshaft, low restriction exhaust and other modifications.

The Dodge Lancer, which had been almost identical to the Valiants of 1961–62, was replaced in 1963 by the Dart. The Dart was available in all the same body styles as the Valiant, except there was no Dodge equivalent of the Barracuda. All Darts used a larger, wheelbase, except for wagons which used the Valiant&#x27;s wheelbase.

==Third generation (1967–1973)==

The Valiant was completely redesigned for 1967 model year and the station wagons, hardtops, and convertibles were dropped. Buyers who wanted a Valiant-type hardtop coupe or convertible could choose a similarly styled Barracuda, which was still based on the Valiant with a slightly sportier style. The new Valiant model range included two- and four-door sedans on a newly lengthened wheelbase. The design was straightforward and rectilinear. The body sides were mildly sculptured with a tapering lower feature line that widened toward the wheels. The new fenders had a vertical slab look. The grille was vertically split and subdivided horizontally. Vertical taillights were segmented and had a fanned-out look. Horsepower rating for the Slant-6 engine was raised from to by installation of the slightly bigger camshaft introduced on the 225 in 1965, together with Carter BBS and Holley 1920 carburetors using the larger throttle bore previously reserved for the 225, rather than the smaller carburetors formerly used on the 170 engine. Federally-mandated safety equipment was provided on all 1967s, including a new dual-chamber brake master cylinder, energy-absorbing steering column, wheel, and instrument panel controls; shoulder belt mountings for outboard front passengers, a new 4-way hazard flasher, and, for 1970, lane-change directional signals were included.

For the 1968 model, the horizontal division bar was removed from the grille. A fine cross hatched insert was framed by a segmented chrome surround. Model nameplates were moved from the rear fender to the front fender. The , V8 was a Valiant option for the first time. All North American Chrysler products got front and rear side marker lights, amber in front, red in the rear. These were round in shape, surrounded by an attractive chrome bezel. Valiants built after January 1, 1968, also got new front shoulder belts as standard.

For 1969, a new one-piece, full-width grille, new taillights and trim were featured. Standard engines were unchanged, although refinements in the Chrysler &quot;clean air system&quot; (formerly &quot;clean air package&quot;) produced better operating economy from the six-cylinder engines. Improved drum brake self-adjusters, a more efficient power steering pump, and improvements to the optional Sure-Grip differential were also highlighted. Starting with cars built on January 1, 1969, front seat headrests were now standard. 1969 Valiants got new rectangular side marker lamps with federally required integral reflectors.

For 1970, the Valiant was carried over with detail changes, including a new black plastic grille sculptured differently from 1969&#x27;s metal item. The central portion protruded flush with the forward edge of the hood, while the remainder of the grille was set back from the front plane. The two-door sedan was dropped, replaced by the new Duster coupe (see below). For all except export Valiants, the base 170 engine was replaced by a new version of the slant-six. The 198 gave better performance than the 170, and was less costly to make, since it used the same cylinder block as the 225. The Valiant was virtually unchanged for 1971; small revisions included removal of the center grille emblem and a new kind of finish treatment on the grille surround. It now had a blacked-out look instead of the previous argent silver treatment. For the 1970 and 1971 models, exterior and interior trim were slightly revised, and there were engineering changes for better driveability, improved soundproofing and decreased emissions, the latter in compliance with regulations mandated by the newly created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implementing new devices such as an EGR valve and an activated charcoal evaporative emissions system. The 1971 Valiant eventually set sales records with 256,930 calendar year deliveries, so there was little motivation to change it for 1972. Only details of the taillights and grille were altered for the 1972 Valiants. New surface-mount sidemarker lamp-reflector units replaced the more costly previous flush-mount items.

Beginning in 1971, a badge-engineered version of the wheelbase Dodge Dart Swinger called the &quot;Valiant Scamp&quot; was offered. This used the Dart Swinger two-door hardtop body shell with Valiant front sheet metal and dual taillamps carried over from the 1970 Dodge Dart.

The year 1972 saw the Valiant&#x27;s best sales ever, with 330,373 sold.

For 1973, the vent wing windows were deleted from the Scamp, and all models were given a new grille and front bumpers able to withstand damage at a impact, as well as steel beams inside the doors to protect vehicle occupants in side-impact collisions as mandated by NHTSA. The door beams, the new bumpers and their impact-absorbing mounts, a rubber-booted telescoping system attached to the car&#x27;s structure, added mass to the Valiant. At the same time, engines were being progressively detuned to comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Performance and economy suffered as a result.

Through the early 1970s, the Valiant took more than 40% of Plymouth&#x27;s total sales volume. These models also had considerable success in foreign markets. Worldwide, Chrysler affiliates and subsidiaries sold American- or Canadian-made Valiants from complete knock down kits, as well as locally designed and engineered Valiants and Valiant-based vehicles incorporating a mix of North American and local design and components.

==Fourth generation (1974–1976)==
In 1974, the wheelbase variant of the A-body sedan was dropped, and the Valiant sedan became a rebadged Dart. The larger size resulted in thicker C-pillars and new rear fender contours. Thenceforth, the only differences between the Valiant and Dart were minor cosmetics. The 1973 Valiant grille and front sheet metal were retained for 1974, but the front bumper&#x27;s rubber guards were chromed. The taillights were extensively redesigned, resulting in a more formal look. The US federal bumper standards were applied to rear bumpers for the 1974 models, adding even more weight to the Valiant. Since the Duster (1970), Dart-based Scamp (1971) and Dart-based sedan (1974) displaced both of the Valiant&#x27;s 1967 bodies, they could be considered to represent a fourth generation of Valiants.

1974 Valiant was also available in a &quot;Scamp package&quot; which included 318 V8 engine, four door, three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, power disc brakes, chrome trim, vinyl roof, AC, carpet, split vinyl bucket seat bench, radio, rear window defroster blower, and 120 mph speedometer standard. Production was limited and ordered as customers requested the package, a few hundred were produced.

1974 introduced the Valiant Brougham and its twin, the Dodge Dart special edition. Available in two- or four-door models, they were a compact luxury car meant as an attractive alternative to larger luxury cars following the 1973 oil crisis. The Brougham had generous chrome trim, a vinyl top, deep cut-pile carpeting, velour cloth upholstery, interior door padding, color-keyed or simulated wire wheel covers, and a special selection of paint and trim combinations. Much of the optional equipment on a regular Valiant became standard equipment on Brougham models such as power steering, power disc brakes, air conditioning, cruise control, electric rear window defroster and an AM/FM radio.

With a slightly restyled grille, 1975 models were essentially carry-overs from 1974 except that California and certain high-altitude models received catalytic converters and required unleaded gasoline. The 1975 Valiants had several new items available to buyers with increasing interest in fuel economy. These included radial tires and a &quot;Fuel Pacer&quot; system that lit a warning light to tell the driver he was driving uneconomically, as well as Chrysler&#x27;s A833OD four-speed manual transmission, the first four-speed Chrysler had offered with a six-cylinder engine in the North American market since 1965. There were new spark plugs and batteries and a &quot;clincher&quot; warranty that covered everything on the car except trim for 12 months with no mileage restrictions.

1976 models were virtually identical to 1975s; amber rather than clear front park/turn signal lights were used and the parking brake pull-handle was changed to a foot pedal.

===A38 police package===

In 1976, the Valiant was available as a Code A38 police package car and offered in three basic engine sizes: E24 (California emission standards) and E25 (federal) single-barrel slant-six; E44 , twin-barrel V-8; E58 , four-barrel V-8 with single (California) or dual (federal) exhaust. It was the E58 that Chrysler recommended for police service as it was the only one with &quot;added endurance features to improve durability&quot;. The E58 produced 175 net hp in California trim and 220 net hp in federal form. The E58 dual exhaust engine (sans catalytic converters) made for a very fast Valiant squad car. So equipped, this compact Chrysler cop car tripped the quarter-mile lights in 16.4 seconds with trap speeds of and could catch nearly all the so-called &quot;performance cars&quot; of the day. The Seattle Police Department using the Valiant A38 reported a 46 percent drop in the preventable accident rate among police officers, and according to a &quot;Motor Trend&quot; police survey, the A38 Valiant had much better evasive capabilities, better overall visibility, and was generally easier to drive than the full-size squad cars. A special handling package applied to the A38 Valiant included front and rear antisway bars. However, the Valiant was not physically durable enough; it lacked additional frame welds and rear cross-member reinforcements standard on all other Mopar A38 packages. More importantly, the front K-frame of the Valiant was prone to failure under severe police use.

===Replacement with Plymouth Volaré and Dodge Aspen===
In 1976, the Plymouth Volaré and Dodge Aspen F-body cars were introduced mid-year replacing the Valiant and Dart, respectively. Production of the A-body shifted to Saint Louis Assembly while Hamtramck Assembly was dedicated to the new F-body, which did not maintain their predecessors&#x27; reputation for quality and durability and in fact reversed it. The change hurt Chrysler&#x27;s reputation and profitability, contributing to its near-bankruptcy in 1979–80.

==Derivative models==

===Barracuda===

Automotive trends in the early middle 1960s had all the US automakers looking at making compact sporty cars. The Valiant was a natural choice of basis for Chrysler&#x27;s efforts in this direction. Ford&#x27;s Mustang gave this type of vehicle its common &quot;pony car&quot; moniker, but in fact Chrysler beat Ford to market by two weeks with the April 1, 1964 release of the Barracuda fastback. The Barracuda used the Valiant&#x27;s wheelbase and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent windows, quarter panels and bumpers; all other sheet metal and glass was new. This hybrid design approach significantly reduced the development and tooling cost and time for the new model. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was as similar to the Valiant as the Mustang was different from the Falcon, and its introduction was, at first, barely noticed by most buyers.

The fastback body shape was achieved primarily with an enormous rear window, or backlight, which wrapped down to the fenderline. Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) collaborated with Chrysler designers in producing this rear window, the largest ever installed on a standard production car up to that time. The following year, the fenders and taillamps that had been introduced on the 1964 Barracuda were used on the whole 1965 Valiant range except for the wagon, which got different taillamps.

The second-generation Barracuda, though still a wheelbase A-body sharing many components with the Valiant, was given Barracuda-specific styling and its own range of models including convertibles and fastback and notchback hardtops. A wide range of engines were available on the Barracuda throughout its production lifecycle, from a 145-hp 225 cubic-inch (3.7L) slant six, up through high-compression small- and big-block V8s.

Although the first and second generation Barracudas were heavily based on the contemporary Valiants, Plymouth wanted them perceived as a distinct models. Consequently, the &quot;Valiant&quot; chrome script that appeared on the 1964 model&#x27;s trunk lid was deleted on the 1965 model in the US market. For 1966, the stylized red-and-blue Valiant &quot;V&quot; emblems were replaced on the Barracuda with a model-specific stylized fish logo. For 1967, the new four-barrel V-8 with was optional only in the Formula S, which boosted the Barracuda&#x27;s performance with 0–60 mph in 7.4 seconds and the quarter mile covered in 15.9 seconds. In other markets such as Canada and South Africa, where Valiant was a marque in its own right, the car remained known as the &quot;Valiant Barracuda&quot; until the A-body Barracuda was discontinued after 1969.

For 1970, the Barracuda lost all commonality with the Valiant as an all-new E-body Barracuda was produced.

===Duster===

Plymouth introduced a sporty new model for 1970: the two-door fastback Duster. The same technique that spawned the 1964 Barracuda was employed for the Duster. It was designed to use the same front end sheet metal, running gear, and wheelbase as the Valiant, but Plymouth&#x27;s stylists gave the car an entirely new look by using a modified fastback configuration with radically curved side glass having only half the curvature radius of conventional side glass. Though the V8 engine with 10.5:1 compression, and of torque had been available for special order in Valiants and Barracudas since 1968, the 340 was offered as a regular production option in the Duster 340, Plymouth&#x27;s analogue to the Dodge Demon 340 and the Dodge Dart Swinger 340. The Duster was an immediate hit as a sporty alternative to the now larger and more expensive Barracuda. Throughout its production lifetime, the vast majority of Dusters were built with the Slant Six engine (available in 198 and 225 cubic inch versions) and TorqueFlite automatic transmission.

An aggressive &quot;shark tooth&quot; grille was offered on the fastback Duster 340 and new-for-1971 Duster Twister models. The Twister was a &quot;performance appearance package&quot; produced in response to increasing premiums on muscle cars, many of which were calculated using the vehicle&#x27;s power-to-weight ratio as an actuarial gauge. Despite the &quot;dust whirl&quot; side stripes and &quot;Twister&quot; decals, Rallye road wheels, dual racing mirrors, twin hood scoops, flat-black hood paint with strobe stripes, and plaid cloth-and-vinyl trim interior available in four colors, the biggest engine available was the V8.

Chrysler increased the displacement of its highest-performance small block V-8 engine from to for 1974. The 360 was rated at and placed in the Duster 360. However, the 1974 Duster was nearly heavier than the 1971 model on account of the heavier bumpers, side-impact door beams, emission control equipment, and added soundproofing. Even with performance options such as the four-speed manual transmission, Hurst shifter and Sure-Grip differential with 3.55:1 axle ratio, 0–60 mph and quarter-mile times increased roughly two seconds compared to those for the 1970 Duster. However, higher fuel prices and performance-car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high performance waned.

==International variants==

===Canada (1960–1966)===
Chrysler Canada marketed the Valiant at Dodge and Plymouth dealers under a standalone &quot;Valiant&quot; marque. The Canadian 1960–62 Valiant was visually similar to its American counterpart except the badge on the trunk lid read &quot;by Chrysler&quot; instead of &quot;Plymouth&quot;. Besides minor differences in interior and exterior trim, the alternator was an extra-cost option in Canada through 1962 while it was standard equipment in America. An anti-ice system for the carburetor&#x27;s throttle body, engine block heater, battery warmer, electric car interior heater and other cold-climate items were available as factory or dealer-installed options. Air conditioning, which was first offered in the US 1961 models, was not made available north of the border until 1966. Some Canadian-made Auto-Lite (now Prestolite) electrical components were used in lieu of the American-production Chrysler-built components. The Windsor, Ontario, plant was a source for left- and right-hand-drive export Valiants as knock down kits.

For 1963 and 1964, the Canadian Valiant used US Plymouth Valiant front sheet metal with the US Dodge Dart body and wheelbase (except wagons, which—like all 1963–1966 Dart and Valiant wagons—were on the wheelbase).

For 1965, Chrysler Canada sold both the wheelbase and the wheelbase A-body vehicles, all badged as Valiants, and all with the US Dart dashboard and instrument cluster. For 1966, the shorter Valiant was dropped from the Canadian market and all Canadian Valiants were now rebadged US Darts.

The Canadian Barracuda, badged as the &quot;Valiant Barracuda&quot;, was built in Canada in 1964 and 1965 but was imported for 1966. Like the Valiant, the Barracuda had no Plymouth markings.

With the coming of the US-Canada Auto Pact of 1965, Chrysler could ship cars and parts both ways over the border and in 1967 the company began importing Plymouth Valiants and Dodge Darts from the US, as well as exporting Darts and Valiants from Windsor to the US.
===Australia (1962–1981)===

The Valiant was introduced in Australia in 1962, as a right-hand drive version of the American 1961 model; just over 1,000 of these were sold before they were superseded by a locally adapted version of the US 1962 model. As in other markets outside the United States, they were sold not as Plymouths but as Chryslers, replacing the previous Chrysler Royal range. The AP5 model, introduced for 1963, was built locally by Chrysler Australia—the first of eleven Valiant model ranges built until 1981. Earlier models bore some resemblance to American Valiants and Dodge Darts until 1971 when the VH model was released; its locally designed body became the basis of all subsequent Australian Valiants and bore no resemblance to any US Valiants. The coupe utility or &quot;ute&quot; (car-based pickup truck), the Valiant Charger coupe, and the Chrysler by Chrysler luxury car were all Valiant-based models unique to Australia.

Australian Valiants were locally built in New Zealand and South Africa; and were exported to the United Kingdom, Japan, and other right-hand drive markets.

Chrysler Australia was eventually bought out by Mitsubishi Motors Australia and the last Australian Valiants were produced by Mitsubishi from 1980 to 1981.

===Mexico (1963–1988)===
Valiants, which were assembled and sold in Mexico from 1963 through 1976, were essentially the same A-body models as their US counterparts with minor differences. The Mexican Valiant lineup included a unique two-door hardtop produced from 1963 to 1969 called the &quot;Acapulco&quot; named after the coastal resort city. Based on a V200 Signet, the Acapulco was not available in the US or anywhere else outside of Mexico. Unique were the 1967-69 models, true 2 door hardtops; a body style not available in the U.S. The most notable features included a cobra snakeskin vinyl roof and emblems of Acapulco in the interior and on the trunk lid. Other features included bucket seats, upgraded interior and remote controlled passenger side mirrors. The car was powered by 2bbl 225 slant-six which was being used concurrently in the Australian market; the manual transmission was operated by a four-on-the-floor Hurst gearshift.

The Valiant Duster was introduced in Mexico in 1970, the same as the Plymouth Duster sold in the US market. Starting in 1972, the Valiant Duster got the same body as the US-market Dodge Demon/Dart Sport. In 1976, A-body cars were discontinued in North America, replaced by the Plymouth Volare/Dodge Aspen. Mexican Volares were badged as &quot;Valiant Volares&quot;; these vehicles had the Volare rear end but with the Aspen grille. When the Volare was replaced with the Reliant &quot;K-cars&quot; in 1981, these cars were marketed as &quot;Valiant Volare Ks&quot; as well. The Valiant Volare K was the last Valiant-badged car sold in Mexico.

===New Zealand (1963–1981)===
New Zealand&#x27;s first Valiant model was the Australian 1963 Chrysler Valiant &quot;S&quot; series. New Zealand assembly of the Australian models began in 1964 by Todd Motors first in Petone, Wellington, and from 1974 in Porirua, Wellington. Only four-door sedans and utilities (pickups) were produced. Station wagons, coupes and the mid-70s upmarket Chrysler by Chrysler sedans were otherwise fully imported from Australia. Todd Motors also assembled the Australian two-door Valiant Charger 770 between 1971 and 1976. Latter Charger models were fully imported. Todd Motors ceased production in 1981.

===Argentina (1962–1968)===
In 1962, Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A. started building the 1960 version of the US Plymouth Valiant under the Chrysler nameplate (although later most of the cars were sold under the &quot;Valiant&quot; nameplate as an independent brand). Only the four-door version was produced. Two models were offered, the &quot;Valiant V200&quot; (Valiant I), with a 2,790 cc engine, and, since 1963, the &quot;Valiant II&quot; with a 3,687 cc engine. In 1965 the &quot;Valiant III&quot; was launched. Despite its name, this car was similar to the 1963 US Dodge Dart. It was offered in three trims, standard, Coronado (luxury) and GT (sport). In 1967 the &quot;Valiant IV&quot; came out. This car also looked very much like the US 1966 Dodge Dart, offering the same trims than the previous version. Production ceased for the Valiants in 1968, when they were replaced by the GTX /Coronado/Polara lineup. However, for the 1968 model year a basic &quot;Valiant&quot; trim of the Coronado/Polara was offered.

===South Africa (1960–1980)===
Right-hand-drive Plymouth Valiants were assembled and sold in South Africa Branded as the DeSoto Rebel from 1960 and were assembled at the Chrysler plant in Cape Town. The cars followed the U.S. Plymouth and Dodge Dart models and the knock-down kits were sourced from Canada. By 1966 the Valiant was the top selling car in South Africa. Although Chrysler in the U.S. stopped making Valiant and Dart station wagons after 1966, station wagons continued to be built in South Africa using U.S. front ends on Australian Valiant VC/VE/VF wagon bodies.

Between 1968 and 1970 a local version of the two-door Plymouth Barracuda was built and sold as the Valiant Barracuda (as in Canada.) Between 1970 and 1973 a local coupe model derived from the U.S. Dodge Demon and Plymouth Duster was built and sold as the Valiant Charger.

In 1972 South Africa switched to assembling Australian Valiants, starting with the VH Valiant. These were available in sedan, station wagon and bakkie (pickup truck/ute.) The Australian Chrysler by Chrysler two-door model was not available but the four door model was sold as the &quot;Dodge SE&quot; and was built with the same locally sourced 225 cid six-cylinder engine used in all South African-built Valiants.

The Australian VJ Valiant was assembled in South Africa and sold as the Valiant J series. The lineup included the Rebel, Rebel 660, Regal, Regal Safari, Charger Coupe, and the VIP. The bakkie was sold as the Fast-Body Rustler Utility thereafter.

At the end of 1976 Chrysler ceased operations in South Africa and the local operation merged with local company Illings (owned by the Anglo-American Corporation.) Thereafter South African Valiants were assembled at the Sigma Motor Corporation plant in Silverton, near Pretoria.

The last Valiants built in South Africa were the Australian Valiant CL which was built from 1975 to 1978 and the Australian Valiant CM which was built from 1978 to 1980. These were marketed as the Chrysler SE.
===United Kingdom (1959–1976)===
Chryslers were imported into the United Kingdom throughout the 20th Century, sourced from both the United States or Canada in factory right-hand drive. Chrysler International in Belgium was in charge of all European imports. The U.K received RHD Plymouth Valiants as well as other Chrysler and Dodge vehicles until 1967 whereupon it was decided by Chrysler International that all RHD markets would thereafter be supplied with vehicles from Australia (with the exception of South Africa which continued to build U.S-derived models until 1972 before it too switched to Australian models.) Chrysler&#x27;s European head office appointed Chrysler Motors Ltd. to be the Australian-import concessionaires for the U.K, and Warwick Wright Ltd. to be the distributors. The announcement was made in Autocar magazine, on 16 October 1966.

The Australian VC, VE, and VF Valiant models were thereafter imported to the U.K in saloon (sedan) and estate (station wagon) form, with the VIP model added in 1969. Rootes Group dealers sold the Australian Valiants on a shared-commission basis with Warwick Wright. Australian VG, VH, VJ, and VK Valiants continued to be sold in the U.K throughout the 1970s, including the Australian Valiant Charger coupe and long-wheelbase Chrysler By Chrysler. Imports ceased after 1976.

==In popular culture==

Steven Spielberg&#x27;s early directorial debut, the television movie &quot;Duel&quot;, prominently featured an orange 1970 Plymouth Valiant, driven by the protagonist, Dennis Weaver. When the film was expanded by 14 minutes for international theatrical release, a nearly-identical 1971 Valiant was used for additional scenes. The choice of the Valiant, according to Spielberg, was not so much for the model of the car, but rather the bright red color (which would photograph well against the high desert landscape of the filming location, near Acton, California).

The 1997 episode of Everybody Loves Raymond titled &quot;The Car&quot; is about Frank Barone selling his 1972 Valiant to Raymond. The car is shown not to be very dependable due to its age, but Ray wanted to buy it for nostalgic reasons.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger (14 April 1890 – 25 April 1947) was a German lawyer who became the State Secretary in the Reich Chancellery under &quot;Reichsminister&quot; Hans Lammers in Nazi Germany. He was Lammers&#x27; representative to the 20 January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned. He was arrested after the fall of the Nazi regime, incarcerated from 1945 to 1947 but released due to ill health and died without ever facing trial.

== Early life and education ==
Kritzinger was born the son of a Protestant pastor in Grünfier (today, Zielonowo, Poland) in the Prussian province of Posen. He attended secondary schools in Posen (today, Poznań) and Gnesen (today, Gniezno), receiving his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1908. He then studied law at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg, the Humboldt University of Berlin and the University of Greifswald. After passing the first state law examination in October 1911, he began a legal clerkship. His legal training was interrupted by his service in the First World War where he served in &quot;Jäger&quot; Battalion #5 (1st Silesian) from 1914 to 1918. He fought on the western front, attained the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot; in the reserves and earned the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class and the Order of Hohenzollern. He was wounded and captured by the French and released in February 1920. In 1921, he completed his legal clerkship and passed the second state law examination.

==Weimar Republic==
From July to September 1921, Kritzinger worked as an attorney at the &quot;Amtsgericht&quot; (district court) in Striegau (today, Strzegom). He then was employed by the Reich Ministry of Justice dealing with questions of international law. In 1925, he transferred to the Prussian Ministry of Trade and Commerce but then returned to the Reich Ministry of Justice the following year, where he was to remain until 1938. He worked as a &quot;Referent&quot; (consultant), initially on matters of international law and, from 1928, matters of constitutional law. During this time he was promoted to &quot;Regierungsrat&quot; (government councilor), &quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot; (senior government councilor) and &quot;Ministerialsrat&quot; (ministerial councilor). Kritzinger did not belong to a political party in the Weimar Republic but, according to his account, he voted for the conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; elections until 1933.

== Career in Nazi Germany ==
Kritzinger welcomed the Nazi seizure of power and dismissed the street violence of those turbulent years as revolutionary excesses. While at the Justice Ministry, Kritzinger was involved in drafting legislation that supported the Nazi regime. For example, he helped to draft the legislation that established the legal basis for expropriating the property of the outlawed trade unions. After the Night of the Long Knives, he worked on a law (Law on the Measures of State Self-defense, 3 July 1934) that legitimized as acts of self-defense the extrajudicial murders of high-ranking &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) leaders and other political opponents.

In early 1938, Kritzinger was offered the opportunity to transfer to the Reich Chancellery. Although the position involved a promotion, he hesitated when informed by the Chancellery Chief Hans Lammers that membership in the Nazi Party was a prerequisite. However, Kritzinger was encouraged to take the position by Minister of Justice Franz Gürtner. Gürtner had been a member of the DNVP and favored having his trusted colleague in the job rather than a more fanatical Nazi. On 1 February 1938, Kritzinger accepted the transfer to the Reich Chancellery as head of Division B with the civil service rank of &quot;Ministerialdirektor&quot;, and he joined the Nazi Party (membership number 4,841,517).

Kritzinger&#x27;s division was in charge of matters involving the issuing of permits for exemption from the Nuremberg Laws. He also was involved with the drafting of draconian wartime legislation such as the so called Regulation Against Public Pests (&quot;Verordnung gegen Volksschädlinge&quot;) of 5 September 1939, which imposed the death penalty for acts like looting and arson. Other laws sought to further deprive the German Jewish population of its remaining rights. The 11th Regulation of the Citizenship Law (25 November 1941) stipulated that all German Jews who had emigrated retrospectively lost their German citizenship, and it provided for the confiscation of their assets. The 13th Regulation (1 July 1943) provided that the assets of German Jews would become the property of the Reich upon their death. It also transferred responsibility for any criminal proceedings against Jews from the judiciary to the police.

=== Wannsee Conference ===

Kritzinger was the oldest of the participants at the Wannsee Conference of 20 January 1942, which planned the implementation of The Final Solution. There is no record of any comments by him in the official minutes of the meeting. There also is no documentation that he vocally or openly opposed the plans discussed at Wannsee, though evidence suggests that he sought to distance himself from the whole affair. He did not attend the follow-up meeting on 6 March 1942, opting to send a less senior official who was instructed not to discuss policy positions but only to report back on the meeting. This may also have been the approach taken by Kritzinger at Wannsee. 

German historian Hans Mommsen claimed that Kritzinger did not see the Wannsee Conference as consequential, and described it to a colleague using a German phrase () meaning a greatly anticipated event that comes to nothing. In the spring of 1942, Kritzinger attempted to resign his position in the Chancellery but his resignation was refused by Lammers, who told him that things would become &quot;much worse if you leave&quot;.

=== Later war years ===
Kritzinger stayed on at the Reich Chancellery and, as the management of the Second World War consumed more and more of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s time and energy, Lammers was usually with the &quot;Führer&quot; at his military field headquarters. Consequently, Kritzinger took on more of the day-to-day operations of the Chancellery in Berlin. He was rewarded on 21 November 1942 when Hitler promoted him to State Secretary of the Chancellery, making him the senior civil servant in the staff of about seventy-five. This was a relatively small staff, considering the large amount of work it had in coordinating the activities of all the Reich ministries. The workload began to take a toll on Kritzinger&#x27;s health, necessitating a six week leave of absence in the spring of 1943 for high blood pressure and impaired vision.

Shortly before the fall of Berlin to the Red Army, Kritzinger left the city on 23 April 1945, where he had been in charge of coordinating the evacuation of the remaining ministry officials and files since 20 April. Making his way westward, he continued to serve as the Chancellery&#x27;s State Secretary in the Flensburg government set up under Hitler&#x27;s appointed successor, &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Karl Dönitz.

== Arrest, imprisonment and death ==

Kritzinger was arrested by British soldiers on 23 May 1945 along with the rest of the Flensburg government. Originally incarcerated at Camp Ashcan at Mondorf-les-Bains in Luxembourg, he later was transferred to Bruchsal. Kritzinger was frequently interrogated by Robert Kempner, U.S. Assistant Chief Counsel at the Nuremberg trials, and he was called as a witness. He was the only one of the Wannsee Conference participants to admit of his own accord that he had been present. He also acknowledged the criminal nature of the conference, and he testified that he had been ashamed of German politics during the war, admitting that Hitler and Heinrich Himmler were mass murderers. He told Kempner: &quot;The worst for me was the treatment of the occupied areas and of the Jews. I was ashamed to visit the grave of my father&quot;. He was released in April 1946 but then arrested again in December. Due to health-related reasons, he was released again and died of natural causes in April 1947.

== Revocation of Kritzinger&#x27;s pension ==
On 22 February 1963, the personnel office for the state of Hesse revoked the entitlement to the pension that Kritzinger&#x27;s widow had been receiving for six years. The rationale cited was that Kritzinger &quot;participated in the issuing of a number of decrees contrary to the rule of law and attended the meeting of state secretaries on 20 January 1942&quot;.

== Fictional portrayals ==
Kritzinger was portrayed by in the German television 1984 film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot;, by David Threlfall in the 2001 BBC/HBO film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; and by in the 2022 German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot;. Kritzinger also appears as a literary figure in Robert Harris&#x27; alternative history novel &quot;Fatherland&quot; (1992).

<text>Dayton International Airport (officially James M. Cox Dayton International Airport, formerly Dayton Municipal Airport and James M. Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport) is 10 miles north of downtown Dayton, in Montgomery County, Ohio, United States. The airport is in an exclave of the city of Dayton not contiguous with the rest of the city. Its address is 3600 Terminal Drive, Dayton, Ohio 45377. The airport is headquarters for American Eagle carrier PSA Airlines.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems called it a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. Dayton International is the third busiest and third largest airport in Ohio behind Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and John Glenn Columbus International Airport. (While Cincinnati&#x27;s airport is also busier, it is located in the neighboring state of Kentucky.)

Dayton International Airport handled 2,607,528 passengers in 2012 and had 57,914 combined takeoffs and landings in 2012. Dayton ranked No. 76 in U.S. airport boardings in 2008. The airport has non-stop flights to 17 destinations.

==History==
In August 1928 a property in Vandalia, Ohio was called the &quot;Dayton Airport&quot;.

On December 17, 1936, the airport opened as the &quot;Dayton Municipal Airport&quot; with three concrete runways and connecting taxiways.

In 1952 the city named the airport &quot;James M. Cox-Dayton Municipal Airport&quot; in honor of the former Governor of Ohio and Democratic candidate for President of the United States. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in 1959 for a new $5.5 million terminal designed by Yount, Sullivan and Lecklider, completed in 1961. The airport&#x27;s name became &quot;James M. Cox Dayton International Airport&quot; in 1975.

The April 1957 OAG shows 73-weekday departures: 56 TWA, 13 American, and 4 Lake Central. TWA had two nonstops to New York but no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago-Detroit-Cleveland-Pittsburgh-Cincinnati. The first jets were TWA Convair 880s from Chicago in January 1961.

The airport was a hub for Piedmont Airlines from July 1, 1982, until its merger with US Airways, which continued the Dayton hub for a year or two. In March 1988 Piedmont had nonstops from Dayton to 27 airports, California to Boston to Florida, plus eight more on its prop affiliate. USAir and successor US Airways kept Dayton as a focus-city. The airport was a hub for Emery Worldwide, a freight carrier.

In 1981 Emery Worldwide completed an air freight hub facility next to Runway 6L–24R. Emery added to the facility until the early 1990s, making it one of the world&#x27;s largest airfreight facilities at the time.

A $50 million renovation of the airport&#x27;s terminal building, designed by Levin Porter Associates, was completed in 1989. A new two-lane access road was built.

In 1998 the airport started renovating the terminal building. The $25 million projects was completed in 2002. The renovations included energy-efficient climate control systems, lighting, windows and entry/exit doorways, a new paging system, and ceiling tiles and carpeting. The news, gift shops, and food and beverage concessionaires improved their leased areas in the terminal building.

In 2004, CNF (which had acquired Emery Worldwide in 1989) sold its Menlo Forwarding business to UPS, who operated the Menlo freight facility at Dayton as an air cargo hub and sorting center.

In June 2006, UPS ceased operations at the Menlo cargo facility, consolidating its cargo operation and sorting facility to its Louisville hub, and reducing cargo tonnage through the Dayton airport by 97% from its 2005 peak 

On May 1, 2011 Air Canada Express ended flights to Toronto Pearson, the airport&#x27;s only international destination, when the airline consolidated its service at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Dayton now has no scheduled international flights.

On August 12, 2012 Southwest Airlines began serving Dayton with flights to Denver International Airport. This was expected to increase passenger traffic by at least 15 percent.

In 2013 Concourse D, built in 1978 and used by Piedmont Airlines and US Airways for their mini-hub operation until its closure in 1991, was demolished. Concourse C was renamed Concourse A.

In 2015 Southwest Airlines announced a reduction in flights from Dayton: nonstop flights to Baltimore, Denver, Orlando, and Tampa all ended April 11, 2016. This left one nonstop destination from Dayton via Southwest. Passenger traffic is down nearly 9% since 2014, along with aircraft departures down 8%. Fares from Dayton have continued to rise while neighboring airports are lowering fares with new low-cost carriers. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport has drastically reduced fares since 2014 while also experiencing over 10% growth in passengers.

On November 19, 2015, Dayton officials announced that Allegiant Air would add service in April twice a week to Orlando and Tampa. Allegiant Air would become the only low-cost fare carrier at the airport and would fill the gap left by Southwest Airlines reduction in flights to Florida.

On January 4, 2017, Southwest announced that it would end its flights to Chicago Midway and move services to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, adding eight daily flights to and from Chicago Midway and Baltimore–Washington International Airport. Southwest&#x27;s last day in Dayton was June 3, 2017.

In January 2025, PSA Airlines announced that it plans to move its corporate headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina from Dayton by January 2026; most daily departures are from, and almost all training is in Charlotte. The new headquarters is to have 400 employees; all 350 Dayton headquarters staff have until the end of April 2025 to accept an invitation to move there. The airline will maintain a maintenance hangar and flight crew location in Dayton, with a total of 550 employees.

On February 3, 2025, Air Wisconsin, which at the time was operating regional jet services for American Airlines, released a statement that due to a shift in business operations, more than 200 employees would be laid off at the airport by the end of March or middle of April; 185 unionized employees would be temporarily laid off, while 20 management and salaried workers would be permanently laid off. American Airlines stated that the jet service provided by Air Wisconsin would be shifted to other regional carriers.

Today the airport covers , and has of runway. It is served by six passenger airlines and has sixteen non-stop destinations. The airport has an estimated $1 billion economic impact on the Dayton area economy.

==Construction projects==

In 2011, Dayton International Airport completed a new air traffic control tower. The tower is about high with a base building of office and operational space for FAA personnel. The switchover to the new tower was at midnight on June 4, 2011. Construction cost $21 million (the tower project&#x27;s total cost was $30.6 million including equipment) and will eventually reduce the current staff of 38 controllers in Dayton to 12.

The airport broke ground in April 2009 for a new multi-level parking garage, which opened in the summer of 2010.

A parking lot improvement project began in October 2008 and provided for: (1) the construction of a new entrance/exit for a new &quot;red&quot; long term parking lot and economy parking lot; (2) reconfiguration and restriping of the existing credit card parking lot; (3) installation of revenue control equipment for the overflow parking lot; (4) upgrade of electrical and lighting within various parking lots. These improvements are to be completed in May 2009. The access road to the terminal has been undergoing several upgrades since October 2007 which involves the rehabilitation of Terminal Drive pavement, drainage system upgrades, installation of underground utilities and erection of new signage and other related roadway improvements.

The airport began a multi-year project in October 2006 to the perimeter roadway network to provide access around the airfield and to enhance safety by eliminating vehicle crossing of runways and taxiways. The project was completed in November 2009.

In June 2009, the airport completed a project to enhance safety by improving the 06R/24L runway safety area. Runway 6R pavement was extended by to connect to the taxiway pavement. In addition, a high-pressure gas transmission main and an service main were relocated from under the footprint of the runway extension. The installation of wildlife fencing, completed in May 2009, enhances airport safety by reducing the movement of wild animals on the airfield.

In January 2018 the airport began another expansion focusing on the end of the airport with the ticketing counters and the parking garage. This work was completed in August 2018.

==Facilities==
Dayton International Airport covers and has three paved runways:

* 06L/24R: × , asphalt/concrete
* 06R/24L: × , concrete
* 18/36: × , asphalt/concrete

There are thirteen instrument approach procedures into the airport: six instrument landing system (ILS) approaches, six Global Positioning System approaches (GPS)m and one non-directional beacon (NDB) approach. Runways with an ILS are 6L, 24R, 24L and 18; 6L has capabilities for CAT II and III ILS procedures. GPS approaches are set up on each runway. Runway 6R is the only runway with an NDB approach.

The terminal has two concourses: Concourse A has 12 jet bridges, and Concourse B has 8.

The airport has multiple fixed-base operators that offer fuel – both avgas and jet fuel – and other services such as general maintenance, aircraft parking, conference rooms, crew lounges, snooze rooms, showers, courtesy transportation, and more.

===Traffic===
In 2018 the airport had an average of 141 aircraft operations per day totaling in 51,445 operations: 24% general aviation, 42% air taxi, 33% scheduled airline, and &lt;1% military.

In 2012 the airport reported 102,700 departures and about 98,200 in 2013.

===Ground transportation and rentals===
Taxicab service is available at curbside. Liberty Cab, Dayton Checker Cab, All America Taxi, Dayton Express Company, Diamond Taxi, Petra Cab, Charter Vans Inc. and Skyair, Inc. all provide ground transportation throughout the Dayton metro area. There are also several rental car companies serving the airport. On August 11, 2013, the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority began offering public transportation service to and from downtown Dayton. With the exception of a few unsuccessful routes in the past, the airport was not served by local public transportation prior to this date, which made it the second busiest airport in the continental United States lacking public transportation options. As of February 2019, Route 43 serves the airport seven to eight times per day on weekdays, six times on Saturdays, and three times on Sundays.

===Amenities===
Restaurants include MVP Bar and Grill, 12th Fairway Bar and Grill, Dunkin Donuts, The Great American Bagel Bakery, and Max &amp; Erma&#x27;s. Several convenience shops and news stands are also located within the airport.

There were two Starbucks locations in the terminal, but they closed due to COVID-19 and will not reopen. The Heritage Booksellers has also closed and been converted to a temporary seating area pending new construction at the airport.

The airport has several Fuel Rod charging stations along with a new Cash to Card machine to pay for checked luggage at airline ticket counters.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===


===Cargo===
The Dayton International Airport once ranked among the nation&#x27;s busiest air freight facilities and was the Midwestern hub for Emery Worldwide, a CF company. Emery, which was then operating under the name Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, was acquired by United Parcel Service (UPS) at the end of 2004. UPS closed the facility on June 30, 2006, moving operations to Worldport at Louisville International Airport.

==Statistics==
For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 41,200 aircraft operations, an average of 113 per day. This was 35% general aviation, 32% air taxi, 31% commercial, and 2% military. For the same time period, 34 aircraft were based at the airport: 13 single-engine and 10 multi-engine airplanes as well as 11 jets.

==In popular media==
In the 2008 film &quot;Eagle Eye&quot;, the two main characters are told to take a bus to the Dayton International Airport. The airport&#x27;s name was mentioned several other times in the movie, even though there are no actual screen shots at the Dayton International Airport in the making of the movie. The actual airport scenes were shot at the Los Angeles International Airport.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On March 9, 1967, TWA Flight 553, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 jet airliner operated by Trans World Airlines, was en route to Dayton when it collided with a Beechcraft Baron over Urbana, Ohio. Visual flight rules (VFR) were in effect at the time of the accident. However, the uncontrolled VFR traffic around Dayton airspace contributed to, also with high rate of descent of the DC-9 prompted, the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s decision to create Terminal Control Areas (either called Class B airspace and Class C airspace) coordination. All 25 passengers and crew of the DC-9 and the sole occupant of the Beechcraft were killed.
* On January 12, 1989, a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 operated by Bradley Air Services, bound for Montréal-Dorval International Airport, crashed approximately north of the airport after colliding with trees due to improper instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures by the first officer. Both occupants were killed.
* On April 8, 1992, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 was damaged during pushback at Dayton International Airport. The left side nose wheel was damaged when the two bar failed, damaging the tire rim. The probable cause of the accident was found to be an inadvertent tire overinflation by a mechanic. A contributing factor was the failure of the mechanic&#x27;s company to make low pressure regulators available to their mechanics during normal work hours.
* On September 13, 2006, a Piper PA-34 Seneca experienced a wheels up landing at Dayton International Airport. The probable cause of the crash was found to be the pilot&#x27;s inadvertent wheels up landing.
* On July 28, 2007 an aircraft performing a loop over the airport at the Vectren Dayton Air Show slammed into the runway when attempting to finish the maneuver. The pilot, Jim LeRoy, was killed in the crash. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain clearance from terrain during an aerobatic maneuver.
* On March 30, 2011, a Boeing 737-300 operated by Northern Air Cargo was substantially damaged during departure from Dayton International Airport. The aircraft was departing Dayton on a positioning flight. On departure, an unsecured pallet jack in the cargo hold of the empty airplane hit the fuselage frame structure, fracturing a structural frame. The airlines Vice President for Operations said that although both pilots looked in the cargo hold of the airplane before departure, neither noticed the unsecured pallet jack. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the flightcrew&#x27;s inadequate preflight inspection, resulting in in-flight structural damage to the airplane&#x27;s fuselage from an unsecured pallet jack that was located in the airplane&#x27;s empty cargo hold. The aircraft was subsequently flown to Tucson, Arizona for repairs.
* On June 20, 2013, a Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche crashed just after takeoff from Dayton. The pilot reported he had found a small amount of water in the right main inboard fuel tank during his preflight checks; no water was found in the other fuel tanks. Upon reexamination of the right fuel tank, no more water was found. After startup, the right engine stopped; though the pilot restarted the engine, he had to run it at slightly higher RPM during warmup. No problems were noted during engine runup or taxi. The departure roll felt &quot;sluggish.&quot; The aircraft started to drift right, and the pilot was unable to correct the drift with rudder, so he reduced the throttles back to idle. The pilot elected to conduct a forced landing on a closed taxiway, so he added power to make it to the taxiway; however, the airplane landed short of the taxiway and impacted a bump in the terrain. The cause of the loss of control could not be determined because postaccident examinations of the aircraft did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
* On June 22, 2013, a Boeing-Stearman Model 75 stunt plane carrying wing walker Jane Wicker crashed at the Vectren Dayton Air Show, killing both Wicker and pilot Charlie Schwenker. The airplane completed a &quot;tear drop&quot; style turn as the wing walker positioned herself on the lower left wing. The airplane then rolled left to fly inverted. While flying from the southwest to the northeast in front of the spectators, the airplane&#x27;s nose pitched slightly above the horizon. The airplane then abruptly rolled to the right and impacted terrain in a left wing low attitude. A post impact fire ensued and consumed a majority of the right wing and forward portion of the fuselage. The probable cause of the crash was found to be the pilot&#x27;s controlled flight into terrain; contributing to the accident was a modified airshow maneuver that placed the aircraft at low altitude and airspeed and out of position within the performance area.
* On May 29, 2014, a Cessna 201 with one crew member on board landed with the landing gear retracted. The pilot was not hurt. The incident was ruled to be caused by pilot error.
* On March 19, 2017, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 operated by Allegiant Air experienced an engine fire during approach into Dayton International Airport. The aircraft landed safely. The probable cause of the fire was found to be an uncontained generator failure.
* On June 23, 2017, the day before an air show, a United States Air Force Thunderbirds F-16D jet, not scheduled to perform, was taxiing to a staging area after a familiarization flight, when witnesses reported a gust of wind flipped the aircraft onto its top in a grassy area next to the taxiway. Both the pilot and a team crew member were trapped in the airplane for two hours; the pilot suffered only minor injuries while the crew member had no visible injuries. The Thunderbirds canceled their scheduled performances for both days of the air show.
* On October 5, 2022, a Bombardier CRJ200 operated by Air Wisconsin for United Express slid off the runway while landing at Dayton. There were no injuries.

<text>Brazzaville Beach is a novel by William Boyd, for which he was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for 1990, and the McVitie&#x27;s Prize for Scottish Writer of the Year. The book tells the story of a woman, Hope Clearwater, researching chimpanzees, and the circumstances that brought her to Africa.
== Plot summary ==
&quot;Brazzaville Beach&quot; consists of three separative narratives. The first is Hope Clearwater&#x27;s reflections on her current life whilst living in a beach house on Brazzaville Beach. The second narrative is a description of her former marriage to John Clearwater, a mathematician, who gradually goes mad resulting from failure to make progress in his academic research. The third narrative, and by far the most graphic, is the narrator&#x27;s account of her work in a national park called Grosso Arvore (Big Tree), where she tracks the movements of a small band of chimpanzees that have split off from a larger group in the north.

John Clearwater, Hope&#x27;s former husband, is a mathematician thirsty for discovery and fame. This part of the narrative is set in London, where the couple share her flat in South Kensington, and southern England, where Hope works as an ecologist on an intriguing hedgerow mapping project in Dorset. At the beginning of their marriage the two are very much in love with Hope believing that John is the ideal man for her owing to his rather eccentric but empathetic character and strong intelligence. She is uninterested in working after getting her PhD until her former Professor forces her to take on the hedgerow mapping project. After being interviewed by Munro, its leader, Hope discovers she is pleased to be working once more, losing weight because she is outside all day, and enjoying the disciplined approach she has to adopt:

However, whilst Hope&#x27;s work is going well, her husband&#x27;s is going badly with John failing to make progress with his mathematical research into chaos theory, and Hope finds herself unable to deal with its consequences. The first signs are when he is caught digging an illegal long trench on the Knap estate in Dorset, work that he feels will help him visualise the mathematical formulae he is trying to come to grips with (having worked before during their stay at a rented cottage in Scotland). He then breaks into hysterics in an Italian restaurant back in London and matters are made worse when Hope discovers he is having an affair with the wife of a Polish university colleague. Their marriage breaks down and irretrievably and tragically, John commits suicide. Hope flees to Africa to recover from the ordeal.

The Grosso Arvore Research Centre, where Hope seeks asylum, is the creation of Eugene Mallabar. After studying wild chimps for the last twenty-five years, Mallabar knows more about them than anyone else on earth. He is the author of &quot;The Peaceful Primate&quot; and &quot;Primate&#x27;s Progress&quot; and the recipient of million-dollar grants. Mallabar has just finished writing a &quot;magnum opus&quot; that will be the last word on the subject of the seemingly gentle beast with which man shares 98 percent of his DNA. Hope Clearwater, however, slowly comes to the realization that the chimps are up to no good as the two groups of chimpanzees she is studying come into lethal conflict. Males from the northern group, led by the alpha male Darius, start patrolling into the southerners&#x27; territory and then start to kill, with extreme cruelty, the rival males - one an old chimpanzee called Mr Jeb, and the other Muffin, an adolescent. What she sees brings Hope herself into conflict with Mallabar, and threatens the very existence of Grosso Arvore research project and his lifelong study of primates.

In tandem with the other two narratives are Hope&#x27;s recollections of her affair with Usman Shoukry, an Egyptian mercenary airforce pilot flying sorties in a MiG-15 against rebel army groups. Hope is able to meet him when she carries out supply runs in the reserve&#x27;s Land Rover to Brazzaville, the provincial capital. He surprises her one time when he designs the world&#x27;s smallest aeroplanes by strapping on wings and landing gears to house flies made from match-sticks and paper. They are both genuinely fond of each other during their time together, with Usman making plans to buy one of the run-down houses on the beach where they go to relax and swim, until he meets an untimely end on one of his missions. Hope herself gets caught up in the civil war when she and Ian Vail are captured by Dr Amilcar and his &quot;atomique boum&quot; volleyball team, who commandeer their Land Rover to return more quickly to the UNAMO stronghold in the Musave River Territories following a failed offensive against the Federal Army.

The story intertwines different narrative strands as the reader is led into the vortex of Hope&#x27;s complex world. Accompanying this are the author&#x27;s detailed descriptions of chaos theory, the social and professional wrangling between the different project members working at the Grosso Avore Research Centre (Ian and Roberta Vail, the thoroughly dislikeable Anton Hauser and the Mallabars themselves), along with the human-like behaviour of the chimpanzees as one group sets out to destroy the other. The aggressors&#x27; motive is to ensure the return of the alpha female, Rita Lu, to her original group which has become dysfunctional during her absence, and these chimpanzee wars only come to an end as a result of human intervention.

<doc id="725514" wikidata="Q591813" url="?curid=725514" title="Mordheim">
<text>Mordheim is a tabletop game published by Games Workshop in 1999. It is a variant of the company&#x27;s Warhammer Fantasy game set on a warband or &quot;skirmish&quot; scale. Mordheim was designed by Alessio Cavatore, Tuomas Pirinen, and Rick Priestley. Alongside the basic skirmish game, &quot;Mordheim&quot; also features a campaign system, where Warbands gain experience and equipment as the campaign progresses, in a similar nature to role-playing games.

The game is set during a civil war in the Empire from Imperial Year 1999, some 500 years before the present day in the Warhammer Fantasy timeline. When a comet struck and destroyed the city of Mordheim, a material called wyrdstone was scattered throughout the ruins. Mercenary warbands from all over the Warhammer world battle with one another for the wyrdstone.

==Warbands==
The official rulebook, which was released in 1999, introduced several warbands which players are able to use. These included human mercenaries from the Empire provinces of Reikland, Middenheim, and Marienburg, cult of the possessed, witch hunters, the sisters of Sigmar, the undead, and skaven.

A &quot;Mordheim&quot; Annual was released in 2002, increasing the number of officially available warbands. The expanded set of warbands introduced orcs and goblins, dwarf treasure hunters, human mercenaries from the Empire province of Ostland and Averland, high elves, and Kislev.

==Computer game adaptation==
A computer-based adaptation of the game titled &quot;&quot; was released for personal computers in November 2015 and for consoles in October 2016. There also exists a mobile version titled &quot;&quot; by Legendary Games.

<text>A religious war or a war of religion, sometimes also known as a holy war (), is a war and conflict which is primarily caused or justified by differences in religion and beliefs. In the modern period, there are frequent debates over the extent to which religious, economic, ethnic or other aspects of a conflict are predominant in a given war. The degree to which a war may be considered religious depends on many underlying questions, such as the definition of religion, the definition of &#x27;religious war&#x27; (taking religious traditions on violence such as &#x27;holy war&#x27; into account), and the applicability of religion to war as opposed to other possible factors. Answers to these questions heavily influence conclusions on how prevalent religious wars have been as opposed to other types of wars.

According to scholars such as Jeffrey Burton Russell, conflicts may not be rooted strictly in religion and instead may be a cover for the underlying secular power, ethnic, social, political, and economic reasons for conflict. Other scholars have argued that what is termed &quot;religious wars&quot; is a largely &quot;Western dichotomy&quot; and a modern invention from the past few centuries, arguing that all wars that are classed as &quot;religious&quot; have secular (economic or political) ramifications. In several conflicts including the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the Syrian civil war, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, religious elements are overtly present, but variously described as fundamentalism or religious extremism—depending upon the observer&#x27;s sympathies. However, studies on these cases often conclude that ethnic animosities drive much of the conflicts.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Wars&quot;, out of all 1,763 known/recorded historical conflicts, 121, or 6.87%, had religion as their primary cause. Matthew White&#x27;s &quot;The Great Big Book of Horrible Things&quot; gives religion as the primary cause of 11 of the world&#x27;s 100 deadliest atrocities.

== Definitions ==
Konrad Repgen (1987) pointed out that belligerents may have multiple intentions to wage a war, may have had ulterior motives that historians can no longer discover, and therefore, calling something a &#x27;religious war&#x27; (or &#x27;war of succession&#x27;) based merely on a motive that a belligerent may have had, does not necessarily make it one. Although ulterior motives may never be known, war proclamations do provide evidence for a belligerent&#x27;s legitimisation of the war to the public. Repgen therefore concluded: 

Philip Benedict (2006) argued that Repgen&#x27;s definition of &#x27;religious war&#x27; was too narrow, because sometimes both legitimisation and motivation can be established. David Onnekink (2013) added that a &#x27;religious war&#x27; is not necessarily the same as a &#x27;holy war&#x27; (&quot;bellum sacrum&quot;): &quot;After all, it is perfectly acceptable to suggest that a worldly prince, say, a Lutheran prince in Reformation Germany, engages in religious warfare using mercenary armies.&quot; While a holy war needs to be authorised by a religious leader and fought by pious soldiers, a religious war does not, he reasoned. His definition of &#x27;war of religion&#x27; thus became:
== Applicability of religion to war ==

Some commentators have questioned the applicability of religion to war, in part because the word &quot;religion&quot; itself is difficult to define, particularly posing challenges when one tries to apply it to non-Western cultures. Secondly, it has been argued that religion is difficult to isolate as a factor, and is often just one of many factors driving a war. For example, many armed conflicts may be simultaneously wars of succession as well as wars of religion when two rival claimants to a throne also represent opposing religions. Examples include the War of the Three Henrys and the Succession of Henry IV of France during the French Wars of Religion, the Hessian War and the War of the Jülich Succession during the Reformation in Germany, and the Jacobite risings (including the Williamite–Jacobite wars) during the Reformation in Great Britain and Ireland.
John Morreall and Tamara Sonn (2013) have argued that since there is no consensus on definitions of &quot;religion&quot; among scholars and no way to isolate &quot;religion&quot; from the rest of the more likely motivational dimensions (social, political, and economic); it is incorrect to label any violent event as &quot;religious&quot;.

Cavanaugh in his &quot;Myth of Religious Violence&quot; (2009) argues that the very concept of &quot;religion&quot; is a modern Western concept that was invented recently in history. As such, he argues that the concept of &quot;religious violence&quot; or &quot;religious wars&quot; are incorrectly used to anachronistically label people and conflicts as participants in religious ideologies that never existed in the first place. The concept of &quot;religion&quot; as an abstraction which entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines is a recently invented concept in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and more prevalent colonization or globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign and indigenous cultures with non-European languages. It was in the 17th century that the concept of &quot;religion&quot; received its modern shape despite the fact that the Bible, the Quran, and other ancient sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written. The modern word &quot;religion&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;religio&quot; which, in the ancient and medieval world, was understood as an individual virtue of worship, never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge. Cavanaugh argued that all wars that are classed as &quot;religious&quot; have secular (economic or political) ramifications. Similar opinions were expressed as early as the 1760s, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, widely recognized to be &quot;religious&quot; in motivation, noting that the warring factions were not necessarily split along confessional lines as much as along secular interests.

There is no precise equivalent of &quot;religion&quot; in Hebrew, and there is no clear definition of jewishness, it could be defined by religion, roots of national origin and ethnic. Jewishness could have been multi-racial. In the Quran, the Arabic word is often translated as &quot;religion&quot; in modern translations, but up to the mid-17th century, translators expressed as &quot;law&quot;.

It was in the 19th century that the terms &quot;Buddhism&quot;, &quot;Hinduism&quot;, &quot;Taoism&quot;, and &quot;Confucianism&quot; first emerged. Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of &quot;religion&quot; since there was no corresponding Japanese word, nor anything close to its meaning, but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this Western idea. According to the philologist Max Müller, what is called ancient religion today, would have only been understood as &quot;law&quot; by the people in the ancient world. In Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes translated as &quot;religion&quot;, also means law. Throughout the classical Indian subcontinent, the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between &quot;imperial law&quot; and universal or &quot;Buddha law&quot;, but these later became independent sources of power.

According to McGarry &amp; O&#x27;Leary (1995), it is evident that religion as one aspect of a people&#x27;s cultural heritage may serve as a cultural marker or ideological rationalization for a conflict that has deeper ethnic and cultural differences. They argued this specifically in the case of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, often portrayed as a religious conflict of a Catholic vs. a Protestant faction, while the more fundamental cause of the conflict was supposedly ethnic or nationalistic rather than religious in nature. Since the native Irish were mostly Catholic and the later British-sponsored immigrants were mainly Protestant, the terms become shorthand for the two cultures, but McGarry &amp; O&#x27;Leary argued that it would be inaccurate to describe the conflict as a religious one.

In their 2015 review of violence and peacemaking in world religions, Irfan Omar and Michael Duffey stated: &quot;This book does not ignore violence committed in the name of religion. Analyses of case studies of seeming religious violence often conclude that ethnic animosities strongly drive violence.&quot;

== Prevalence ==

The definition of &#x27;religious war&#x27; and the applicability of religion to war have a strong influence on how many wars may be properly labelled &#x27;religious wars&#x27;, and thus how prevalent religious wars have been as opposed to other wars.

According to Kalevi Holsti (1991, p. 308, Table 12.2), who catalogued and categorised wars from 1648 to 1989 into 24 categories of &#x27;issues that generated wars&#x27;, &#x27;protect[ion of] religious confrères&#x27; (co-religionists) was (one of) the primary cause(s) of 14% of all wars during 1648–1714, 11% during 1715–1814, 10% during 1815–1914, and 0% during 1918–1941 and 1945–1989. Additionally, he found &#x27;ethnic/religious unification/irredenta&#x27; to be (one of) the primary cause(s) of 0% of all wars during 1648–1714 and 1715–1814, 6% during 1815–1914, 17% during 1918–1941, and 12% during 1945–1989.

In their 1997 &quot;Encyclopedia of Wars&quot;, authors Charles Phillips and Alan Axelrod documented 1763 notable wars in world history, out of which 121 wars were in the &quot;religious wars&quot; category in the index. They note that before the 17th century, much of the &quot;reasons&quot; for conflicts were explained through the lens of religion and that after that time wars were explained through the lens of wars as a way to further sovereign interests. Some commentators have concluded that only 123 wars (7%) out of these 1763 wars were fundamentally originated by religious motivations. Andrew Holt (2018) traced the origin of the &quot;only 123 religious wars&quot; claim back to the 2008 book &quot;The Irrational Atheist&quot; of far-right activist Vox Day, which he notes is slightly adjusted compared to the 121 that is indeed found in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Wars&quot; itself.

&quot;The Encyclopedia of War&quot;, edited by Gordon Martel, using the criteria that the armed conflict must involve some overt religious action, concludes that 6% of the wars listed in their encyclopedia can be labelled religious wars.

==Holy war concepts in religious traditions==
While early empires could be described as henotheistic, i.e. dominated by a single god of the ruling elite (as Marduk in the Babylonian empire, Assur in the Assyrian empire, etc.), or more directly by deifying the ruler in an imperial cult, the concept of &quot;holy war&quot; enters a new phase with the development of monotheism.

===Ancient warfare and polytheism===
During classical antiquity, the Greco-Roman world had a pantheon with particular attributes and interest areas. Ares personified war. While he received occasional sacrifice from armies going to war, there was only a very limited &quot;cult of Ares&quot;. In Sparta, however, each company of youths sacrificed to Enyalios before engaging in ritual fighting at the Phoebaeum.

Hans M. Barstad (2008) claimed that this ancient Greek attitude to war and religion differed from that of ancient Israel and Judah: &quot;Quite unlike what we find with the Greeks, holy war permeated ancient Israelite society.&quot; Moreover, ever since the pioneering study of Manfred Weippert, &quot;»Heiliger Krieg« in Israel und Assyrien&quot; (1972), scholars have been comparing the holy war concept in the (monotheistic) Hebrew Bible with other (polytheistic) ancient Near Eastern war traditions, and found &quot;many [striking] similarities in phraseology and ideology&quot;.

===Christianity===

According to historian Edward Peters, before the 11th century, Christians had not developed a concept of holy war (&quot;bellum sacrum&quot;), whereby fighting itself might be considered a penitential and spiritually meritorious act. During the ninth and tenth centuries, multiple invasions occurred which led some regions to make their own armies to defend themselves and this slowly lead to the emergence of the Crusades, the concept of &quot;holy war&quot;, and terminology such as &quot;enemies of God&quot; in the 11th century. In early Christianity, St. Augustine&#x27;s concept of just war (&quot;bellum iustum&quot;) was widely accepted, but warfare was not regarded as a virtuous activity and expressions of concern for the salvation of those who killed enemies in battle, regardless of the cause for which they fought, was common.

During the era of the Crusades, some of the Crusaders who fought in the name of God were recognized as the &quot;Milites Christi&quot;, the soldiers or the knights of Christ.
The Crusades were a series of military campaigns against the Muslim Conquests that were waged from the end of the 11th century through the 13th century. Originally, the goal of the Crusaders was the recapture of Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the Muslims, and the provision of support to the besieged Christian Byzantine Empire which was waging a war against Muslim Seljuq expansion into Asia Minor and Europe proper. Later, Crusades were launched against other targets, either for religious reasons, such as the Albigensian Crusade, the Northern Crusades, or because of political conflicts, such as the Aragonese Crusade. In 1095, at the Council of Clermont, Pope Urban II raised the level of the war from a &quot;bellum iustum&quot; (a &quot;just war&quot;), to a &quot;bellum sacrum&quot; (a &quot;holy war&quot;).

=== Hinduism ===
This does not refer to religious conflict. &quot;Dharma-yuddha&quot; in Hindu texts, refers to the protocol to be followed by both parties at war. It sets the rules for both sides to conduct the war fairly (&quot;jus in bello&quot;). It is important in Vedic and epic literature such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The word Dharma may be interpreted variously as righteousness or responsibility or duty based on the context. 

Neither the Mahabharata nor the Ramayana were religious conflicts. The Mahabharata was fought over the inheritance of the kingdom of Hastinapura. Ramayana was fought over the abduction of Rama&#x27;s wife Sita by Ravana. The two epics are of great importance in Hindu tradition.

However, according to Torkel Berkke, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; does not provide a clear discussion on who has the authority to initiate a war (&quot;jus ad bellum&quot;), nor on what makes a war just (&quot;bellum justum&quot;).

===Islam===

The first forms of military jihad occurred after the migration (hijra) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to Medina from Mecca and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was :

===Judaism===


Reuven Firestone (2012) stated &quot;that holy war is a common theme in the Hebrew Bible. Divinely legitimized through the authority of biblical scripture and its interpretation, holy war became a historical reality for the Jews of antiquity. Among at least some of the Jewish groups of the late Second Temple period until the middle of the second century, C.E., holy war was an operative institution. That is, Jews engaged in what is defined here as holy war.&quot; He mentioned the Maccabean Revolt (167–160 BCE), the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) as three examples of a &quot;holy war&quot; or &quot;Commanded War&quot; ( &quot;Milkhemet Mitzvah&quot;) in the eyes of Rabbinic Judaism at the time. He asserted that this concept may have re-emerged in modern times within some factions of the Zionist movement, particularly Revisionist Zionism.

In 2016, however, Firestone made a distinction between what he regarded as the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s concept and the &#x27;Western&#x27; concept of holy war:&quot;Holy war&quot; is a Western concept referring to war that is fought for religion, against adherents of other religions, often in order to promote religion through conversion, and with no specific geographic limitation. This concept does not occur in the Hebrew Bible, whose wars are not fought for religion or in order to promote it but, rather, in order to preserve religion and a religiously unique people in relation to a specific and limited geography.Several scholars regard war narratives in the Hebrew Bible, such as the war against the Midianites in Numbers 31, to be a holy war, with Niditch (1995) asserting the presence of a &quot;priestly ideology of war in Numbers 31&quot;. Hamilton (2005) argued that the two major concerns of Number 31 are the idea that war is a defiling activity, but Israelite soldiers need to be ritually pure, so they may only fight wars for a holy cause, and are required to cleanse themselves afterwards to restore their ritual purity. The Israelite campaign against Midian was blessed by the Israelite god Yahweh, and could therefore be considered a holy war. Olson (2012), who believed the war narrative to be a fictional story with a theological purpose, noted that the Israelite soldiers&#x27; actions in Numbers 31 closely followed the holy war regulations set out in Deuteronomy 20:14, although Moses&#x27; commandment to also kill the captive male children and non-virgin women was a marked departure from these regulations. He concluded: &quot;Many aspects of this holy war text may be troublesome to a contemporary reader. But understood within the symbolic world of the ancient writers of Numbers, the story of the war against the Midianites is a kind of dress rehearsal that builds confidence and hope in anticipation of the actual conquest of Canaan that lay ahead.&quot;

Dawn (2016, translating Rad 1958) stated: &quot;From the earliest days of Israel&#x27;s existence as a people, holy war was a sacred institution, undertaken as a cultic act of a religious community&quot;.

Other wars known to Judaism include a mandatory war and a voluntary war.

=== Shinto ===

=== Sikhism ===
== Antiquity ==
In Greek antiquity, four (or five) wars were fought in and around the Panhellenic sanctuary at Delphi (the Pythia (Oracle) residing in the Temple of Apollo) against persons or states who allegedly committed sacrilegious acts before the god Apollo. The following are distinguished:

* The First Sacred War (595–585 BCE)
* The Second Sacred War (449–448 BCE)
* The Third Sacred War (356–346 BCE)
* The Fourth Sacred War (339–338 BCE)
* The Fifth Sacred War (281–280 BCE)

Firestone (2012) stated that in the eyes of ancient Rabbinic Judaism, the Maccabean Revolt (167–160 BCE), the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) were &quot;holy wars&quot; or &quot;Commanded Wars&quot; ( &quot;Milkhemet Mitzvah&quot;).

== Middle Ages ==
=== Christianisation of Europe ===

According to Gregory of Tours&#x27; writings, King Clovis I of the Franks waged wars against other European nations who followed Arian Christianity, which was seen by Catholics as heretical. During his war with the Arian Visigoths, Clovis reportedly said: &quot;I take it very hard that these Arians hold part of the Gauls. Let us go with God&#x27;s help and conquer them and bring the land under our control.&quot;

The Saxon Wars (772–804) of Frankish king Charlemagne against the Saxons under Widukind were described by Jim Bradbury (2004) as &quot;in essence a frontier struggle and a religious war against pagans – devil-worshippers according to Einhard.&quot; He noted that Charlemagne ordered the destruction of the Irminsul, an object sacred to the Saxons. Per Ullidtz (2014) stated that previous Frankish–Saxon conflicts spanning almost a century &quot;had been mostly a border war&quot;, &quot;but under Charles it changed character&quot;: because of &quot;Charles&#x27; idea of unity, of a king over all German tribes, and of universal Christianity in all of his kingdom, it changed into a mission from heaven.&quot; Similarly, a successful Carolingian campaign against the Pannonian Avars in the 790s led to their forced conversion to Christianity. The earlier Merovingian conquests of Thuringia, Allemannia and Bavaria had also resulted in their Christianisation by 555, although the Frisians resisted with similar determinacy as the Saxons during the Frisian–Frankish wars (7th and 8th century), with both tribes killing several Christian missionaries in defence of their Germanic paganism, to the horror of Christian hagiographers.

=== Crusades ===

The Crusades are a prime example of wars whose religious elements have been extensively debated for centuries, with some groups of people in some periods emphasising, restoring or overstating the religious aspects, and other groups of people in some periods denying, nuancing or downplaying the religious aspects of the Crusades in favour of other factors. &quot;Winkler Prins&quot;/&quot;Encarta&quot; (2002) concluded: &quot;The traditional explanation for the Crusades (a religious enthusiasm that found an outlet in a Holy War) has also retained its value in modern historical scholarship, keeping in mind the fact that it has been pointed out that a complex set of socio-economic and political factors allowed this enthusiasm to manifest itself.&quot;

The Crusades against Muslim expansion in the 11th century were recognized as a &quot;holy war&quot; or a &quot;bellum sacrum&quot; by later writers in the 17th century. The early modern wars against the Ottoman Empire were seen as a seamless continuation of this conflict by contemporaries.

=== Reconquista ===
Jim Bradbury (2004) noted that the belligerents in the &quot;Reconquista&quot; were not all equally motivated by religion, and that a distinction should be made between &#x27;secular rulers&#x27; on the one hand, and on the other hand Christian military orders which came from elsewhere (including the three main orders of Knights Templar, Knights Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights), or were established inside Iberia (such as those of Santiago, Alcántara and Calatrava). &quot;[The Knights] were more committed to religious war than some of their secular counterparts, were opposed to treating with Muslims and carried out raids and even atrocities, such as decapitating Muslim prisoners.&quot;

The Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, known in Arab history as the Battle of Al-Uqab (معركة العقاب), was fought on 16 July 1212 and it was an important turning point in both the &quot;Reconquista&quot; and the medieval history of Spain. The forces of King Alfonso VIII of Castile were joined by the armies of his Christian rivals, Sancho VII of Navarre, Pedro II of Aragon and Afonso II of Portugal in battle against the Berber Muslim Almohad conquerors of the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula.

=== Hussite Wars ===

The relative importance of the various factors that caused the Hussite Wars (1419–1434) is debated. Kokkonen &amp; Sundell (2017) claimed that the death of king Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia on 19 August 1419 is the event that sparked the Hussite rebellion against his nominal heir Sigismund (then king of Germany, Hungary and Croatia), making it essentially a war of succession. Nolan (2006) named religion as one of several significant causes, summarising the Hussites&#x27; motives as &quot;doctrinal as well as &#x27;nationalistic&#x27; and constitutional&quot;, and providing a series of issues that led to war: the trial and execution of Jan Hus (1415) &quot;provoked the conflict&quot;, the Defenestration of Prague (30 July 1419) &quot;began the conflict&quot;, while &quot;fighting began after King Wenceslaus died, shortly after the defenestration&quot; (that is, after 19 August 1419). Nolan described the wars&#x27; goals and character as follows: &quot;The main aim of the Hussites was to prevent the hated Sigismund mounting the throne of Bohemia, but fighting between Bohemian Hussites and Catholics spread into Moravia. (...) cross-class support gave the Hussite Wars a tripartite and even &#x27;national&#x27; character unusual for the age, and a religious and social unity of purpose, faith, and hate&quot;. &quot;Winkler Prins&quot;/&quot;Encarta&quot; (2002) described the Hussites as a &quot;movement which developed from a religious denomination to a nationalist faction, opposed to German and Papal influence; in the bloody &quot;Hussite Wars&quot; (1419–1438), they managed to resist.&quot; It did not mention the succession of Wenceslaus by Sigismund, but noted elsewhere that it was Sigismund&#x27;s policy of Catholic Church unity which prompted him to urge Antipope John XXIII to convene the Council of Constance in 1414, which ultimately condemned Jan Hus.

=== Soga–Mononobe conflict ===

Buddhism was formally introduced into Japan by missionaries from the kingdom of Baekje in 552. Adherents of the native Shinto religion resisted the spread of Buddhism, and several military conflicts broke out, starting with the Soga–Mononobe conflict (552–587) between the pro-Shinto Mononobe clan (and Nakatomi clan) and the pro-Buddhist Soga clan. Although the political power each of the clans could wield over the royal family was also an important factor, and was arguably a strategic reason for the Soga to adopt and promote Buddhism as a means to increase their authority, the religious beliefs from both doctrines, as well as religious explanations from events that happened after the arrival of Buddhism, were also causes of the conflict that escalated to war. Whereas the Soga argued that Buddhism was a better religion because it had come from China and Korea, whose civilisations were widely regarded as superior and to be emulated in Yamato (the central kingdom of Japan), the Mononobe and Nakatomi maintained that there should be continuity of tradition and that worshipping the native gods (&quot;kami&quot;) was in the best interest of the Japanese. Unable to reach a decision, Emperor Kinmei (r. 539–571) maintained Shinto as the royal religion, but allowed the Soga to erect a temple for the statue of Buddha. Afterwards, an epidemic broke out, which Shintoists attributed to the anger of the native gods to the intrusion of Buddhism; in reaction, some burnt down the Buddhist temple and threw the Buddha statue into a canal. However, the epidemic worsened, which Buddhists in turn interpreted as the anger of Buddha to the sacrilege committed against his temple and statue. Both during the 585 and 587 wars of succession, the opposing camps were drawn along the Shinto–Buddhist divide, and the Soga clan&#x27;s victory resulted in the imposition of Buddhism as the Yamato court religion under the regency of Prince Shotoku.

=== Toltec religious wars ===
There have been several religious wars in the Toltec Empire of Mesoamerica (c. 980–1110) between devotees of Tezcatlipoca and followers of Quetzalcoatl; the latter lost and were driven to flee to the Yucatán Peninsula.

== Early modern period ==
=== European wars of religion ===
The term &quot;religious war&quot; was used to describe, controversially at the time, what are now known as the European wars of religion, and especially the then-ongoing Seven Years&#x27; War, from at least the mid 18th century. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; maintains that &quot;[the] wars of religion of this period [were] fought mainly for confessional security and political gain&quot;.

In 16th-century France, there was a series of wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots primarily), known as the French Wars of Religion. In the first half of the 17th century, the German states, Scandinavia (Sweden, primarily) and Poland were beset by religious warfare during the Thirty Years War. Catholicism and Protestantism figured on the opposing sides of this conflict, though Catholic France took the side of the Protestants, but it did so for purely political reasons.

In the late 20th century, a number of revisionist historians such as William M. Lamont regarded the English Civil War (1642–1651) as a religious war, with John Morrill (1993) stating: &quot;The English Civil War was not the first European revolution: it was the last of the Wars of Religion.&quot; This view has been criticised by various pre-, post- and anti-revisionist historians. Glen Burgess (1998) examined political propaganda written by the Parliamentarian politicians and clerics at the time, noting that many were or may have been motivated by their Puritan religious beliefs to support the war against the &#x27;Catholic&#x27; king Charles I of England, but tried to express and legitimise their opposition and rebellion in terms of a legal revolt against a monarch who had violated crucial constitutional principles and thus had to be overthrown. They even warned their Parliamentarian allies to not make overt use of religious arguments in making their case for war against the king. However, in some cases it may be argued that they hid their pro-Anglican and anti-Catholic motives behind legal parlance, for example by emphasising that the Church of England was the &quot;legally established&quot; religion: &quot;Seen in this light, the defenses of Parliament&#x27;s war, with their apparent legal-constitutional thrust, are not at all ways of saying that the struggle was not religious. On the contrary, they are ways of saying that it was.&quot; Burgess concluded: &quot;[T]he Civil War left behind it just the sort of evidence that we could reasonably expect a war of religion to leave.&quot;

=== Ethiopian–Adal War ===

The Ethiopian–Adal War (1529–1543) was a military conflict between the Abyssinians and the Adal Sultanate. The Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi came close to extinguishing the ancient realm of Abyssinia, and forcibly converting all of its surviving subjects to Islam. The intervention of the European Cristóvão da Gama attempted to help to prevent this outcome, but he was killed by al-Ghazi. However, both polities exhausted their resources and manpower in this conflict, allowing the northward migration of the Oromo into their present homelands to the north and west of Addis Ababa. Many historians trace the origins of hostility between Somalia and Ethiopia to this war.

== Modern period ==
=== Greek War of Independence ===

The Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) has sometimes been considered a religious war between Christians and Muslims, especially in its early phase. The Greek Declaration of Independence (issued on 15 January 1822) legitimised the armed rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in a mix of religious and nationalist terms: &quot;The war we are waging against the Turks, far from being founded in demagoguery, seditiousness or the selfish interests of any one part of the Greek nation, is a national and holy war (...). It is from these principles of natural rights and desiring to assimilate ourselves with our European Christian brethren, that we have embarked upon our war against the Turks.&quot; Scottish writer Felicia Skene remarked in 1877: &quot;The Greek war of independence has never been called a religious war, and yet it had a better claim to that appellation than many a conflict which has been so named by the chroniclers of the past. It is a significant fact that the standard of revolt was raised by no mere patriot, but by Germanus, the aged Archbishop of Patras, who came forward, strong in his spiritual dignity (...) to be the first champion in the cause of Hellenic liberty.&quot; Ian Morris (1994) stated that &quot;the uprising in 1821 was mainly a religious war&quot;, but that philhellene Western volunteers joined the war for quite different reasons, namely to &#x27;regenerate&#x27; Greece and thereby Europe, motivated by Romantic ideas about European history and civilisation, and Orientalist views of Ottoman culture. The Filiki Eteria, the main organisation driving the rebellion, was split between two groups: one advocated the restoration of the Byzantine Empire on religious grounds, and to encourage all Christians within Ottoman territory to join the Greek revolutionaries; the other advocated the Megali Idea, a large Greek nation-state based on shared language rather than religion. Both of these grand objectives failed, but a smaller version of the latter goal was accepted by most members of the Eteria by 1823, and this goal was generally compatible with the motives of philhellenes who travelled to Greece to enter the war in 1821–1823.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===


The Israeli–Palestinian conflict can primarily be viewed as an ethnic conflict between two parties where one party is most often portrayed as a singular ethno-religious group which only consists of the Jewish majority and ignores non-Jewish minority Israeli citizens who support the existence of a State of Israel to varying degrees, especially the Druze and the Circassians who, for example, volunteer to serve in the IDF, participate in combat and are represented in the Israeli parliament in greater percentages than Israeli Jews are as well as Israeli Arabs, Samaritans, various other Christians, and Negev Bedouin; the other party is sometimes presented as an ethnic group which is multi-religious (although most numerously consisting of Muslims, then Christians, then other religious groups up to and including Samaritans and even Jews). Yet despite the multi-religious composition of both of the parties in the conflict, elements on both sides often view it as a religious war between Jews and Muslims. In 1929, religious tensions between Muslim and Jewish Palestinians over the latter praying at the Wailing Wall led to the 1929 Palestine riots, including the Hebron and Safed massacres.

In 1947, the UN&#x27;s decision to partition the Mandate of Palestine, led to the creation of the state of Israel and Jordan, which annexed the West Bank portion of the mandate, since then, the region has been plagued with conflict. The 1948 Palestinian exodus also known as the &quot;Nakba&quot; (), occurred when approximately 711,000 to 726,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the Civil War that preceded it. The exact number of refugees is a matter of dispute, though the number of Palestine refugees and their unsettled descendants registered with UNRWA is more than 4.3 million. The causes remain the subject of fundamental disagreement between Palestinians and Israelis. Both Jews and Palestinians make ethnic and historical claims to the land, and Jews make religious claims as well.

According to historian Benny Morris, the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, from the Arab perspective, was &quot;a war of religion as much as, if not more than, a nationalist war over territory.&quot; This assertion has been challenged by other scholars.

===Pakistan and India===
The All India Muslim League (AIML) was formed in Dhaka in 1906 by Muslims who were suspicious of the Hindu-majority Indian National Congress. They complained that Muslim members did not have the same rights as Hindu members. A number of different scenarios were proposed at various times. This was fuelled by the British policy of &quot;Divide and Rule&quot;, which they tried to bring upon every political situation. Among the first to make the demand for a separate state was the writer/philosopher Allama Iqbal, who, in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that a separate nation for Muslims was essential in an otherwise Hindu-dominated subcontinent.

After the dissolution of the British Raj in 1947, British India was partitioned into two new sovereign states—the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. In the resulting Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948, up to 12.5 million people were displaced, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million. India emerged as a secular republic with a Hindu majority, while Pakistan was established as an Islamic republic with Muslim majority population.

===Nigerian conflict===

Inter-ethnic conflict in Nigeria has generally had a religious element. Riots against Igbo in 1953 and in the 1960s in the north were said to have been sparked by religious conflict. The riots against Igbo in the north in 1966 were said to have been inspired by radio reports of mistreatment of Muslims in the south. A military coup d&#x27;état led by lower and middle-ranking officers, some of them Igbo, overthrew the NPC-NCNC dominated government. Prime Minister Balewa along with other northern and western government officials were assassinated during the coup. The coup was considered an Igbo plot to overthrow the northern dominated government. A counter-coup was launched by mostly northern troops. Between June and July there was a mass exodus of Ibo from the north and west. Over 1.3 million Ibo fled the neighboring regions in order to escape persecution as anti-Ibo riots increased. The aftermath of the anti-Ibo riots led many to believe that security could only be gained by separating from the North.

In the 1980s, serious outbreaks between Christians and Muslims occurred in Kafanchan in southern Kaduna State in a border area between the two religions.

The 2010 Jos riots saw clashes between Muslim herders against Christian farmers near the volatile city of Jos, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Officials estimated that 500 people were massacred in night-time raids by rampaging Muslim gangs.

===Buddhist uprising===
During the rule of the Catholic Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, the discrimination against the majority Buddhist population generated the growth of Buddhist institutions as they sought to participate in national politics and gain better treatment. The Buddhist Uprising of 1966 was a period of civil and military unrest in South Vietnam, largely focused in the I Corps area in the north of the country in central Vietnam.

In a country where the Buddhist majority was estimated to be between 70 and 90 percent, Diem ruled with a strong religious bias. As a member of the Catholic Vietnamese minority, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists.

===Chinese conflict===

The Dungan revolt (1862–1877) and Panthay Rebellion (1856–1873) by the Hui were also set off by racial antagonism and class warfare, rather than the mistaken assumption that it was all due to Islam that the rebellions broke out. During the Dungan revolt fighting broke out between Uyghurs and Hui.

In 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 20,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, the Hui led by General Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslims, the Kazakhs, until there were only 135 of them left.

Tensions with Uyghurs and Hui arose because Qing and Republican Chinese authorities used Hui troops and officials to dominate the Uyghurs and crush Uyghur revolts. Xinjiang&#x27;s Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth rate of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew by 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in the Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur Muslim populations. Some old Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the Battle of Kashgar (1934) massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which caused tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism, and generally do not want to get involved in conflicts in other countries over Islam for fear of being perceived as radical. Hui and Uyghur live apart from each other, praying separately and attending different mosques.

===Lebanese Civil War===

There is no consensus among scholars on what triggered the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990). However, the militarization of the Palestinian refugee population, along with the arrival of the PLO guerrilla forces, sparked an arms race for the different Lebanese political factions. However, the conflict played out along three religious lines: Sunni Muslim, Christian Lebanese and Shiite Muslim, Druze are considered among Shiite Muslims.

It has been argued that the antecedents of the war can be traced back to the conflicts and political compromises reached after the end of Lebanon&#x27;s administration by the Ottoman Empire. The Cold War had a powerful disintegrative effect on Lebanon, which was closely linked to the polarization that preceded the 1958 political crisis. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, an exodus of Palestinian refugees, who fled the fighting or were expelled from their homes, arrived in Lebanon. Palestinians came to play a very important role in future Lebanese civil conflicts, and the establishment of Israel radically changed the local environment in which Lebanon found itself.

Lebanon was promised independence, which was achieved on 22 November 1943. Free French troops, who had invaded Lebanon in 1941 to rid Beirut of the Vichy French forces, left the country in 1946. The Christians assumed power over the country and its economy. A confessional Parliament was created in which Muslims and Christians were given quotas of seats. As well, the president was to be a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of Parliament a Shia Muslim.

In March 1991, Parliament passed an amnesty law that pardoned all political crimes prior to its enactment. The amnesty was not extended to crimes perpetrated against foreign diplomats or certain crimes referred by the cabinet to the Higher Judicial Council. In May 1991, the militias (with the important exception of Hezbollah) were dissolved, and the Lebanese Armed Forces began slowly to rebuild themselves as Lebanon&#x27;s only major non-sectarian institution.

Some violence still occurred. In late December 1991 a car bomb (estimated to carry 220 pounds of TNT) exploded in the Muslim neighborhood of Basta. At least 30 people were killed, and 120 wounded, including former Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan, who was riding in a bulletproof car.

=== Iran–Iraq War ===

In the case of the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), the new revolutionary government of the Islamic Republic of Iran generally described the conflict as a religious war, and used the narrative of &quot;jihad&quot; to recruit, mobilise and motivate its troops. On the other hand, justifications from the Saddam Hussein-led Ba&#x27;athist Iraq were mostly framed in terms of a supposed Persian–Arab historical enmity, and Iraq-centred Arab nationalism (including support for Arab separatism in Khuzestan). Some of the underlying motives of Saddam appear to have been controlling the Shatt al-Arab waterway and region (previously settled by the 1975 Algiers Agreement, which had ended Imperial Iranian support for the 1974–75 Kurdish rebellion against the Iraqi government), obtaining access to the oil reserves in Khuzestan, and exploiting the instability of post-Revolution Iran, including the failed 1979 Khuzestan insurgency. Peyman Asadzade (2019) stated: &quot;Although the evidence suggests that religious motivations by no means contributed to Saddam&#x27;s decision to launch the war, an overview of the Iranian leaders&#x27; speeches and martyrs&#x27; statements reveals that religion significantly motivated people to take part in the war. (...) The Iranian leadership painted the war as a battle between believers and unbelievers, Muslims and infidels, and the true and the false.&quot; Iran cited religious reasons to justify continuing combat operations, for example in the face of Saddam&#x27;s offer of peace in mid-1982, rejected by Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s declaration that the war would not end until Iran had defeated the Ba&#x27;athist regime and replaced it with an Islamic republic.

While Ba&#x27;athist Iraq has sometimes been described as a &quot;secular dictatorship&quot; before the war, and therefore in ideological conflict with the Shia Islamic &#x27;theocracy&#x27; which seized control of Iran in 1979, Iraq also launched the so-called &quot;Tawakalna ala Allah&quot; (&quot;Trust in God&quot;) Operations (April–July 1988) in the final stages of the war. Moreover, the Anfal campaign (1986–1989; in strict sense February–September 1988) was code-named after Al-Anfal, the eighth sura of the Qur&#x27;an which narrates the triumph of 313 followers of the new Muslim faith over almost 900 pagans at the Battle of Badr in the year 624. &quot;Al Anfal&quot; literally means &quot;the spoils (of war)&quot; and was used to describe the military campaign of extermination and looting commanded by Ali Hassan al-Majid (also known as &quot;Chemical Ali&quot;). His orders informed &quot;jash&quot; (Kurdish collaborators with the Baathists, literally &quot;donkey&#x27;s foal&quot; in Kurdish) units that taking cattle, sheep, goats, money, weapons and even women as spoils of war was &quot;halal&quot; (religiously permitted or legal). Randal (1998, 2019) argued that &#x27;Al Anfal&#x27; was &quot;a curious nod to Islam&quot; by the Ba&#x27;athist government, because it had originally been known as a &quot;militantly secular regime&quot;. Some commentators have concluded that the code name was meant to serve as &quot;a religious justification&quot; for the campaign against the Kurds.

===Yugoslav Wars===

The Croatian War (1991–1995) and the Bosnian War (1992–1995) have been viewed as religious wars between the Orthodox, Catholic and Muslim populations of former Yugoslavia: respectively called &quot;Serbs&quot;, &quot;Croats&quot; and &quot;Bosniaks&quot; (or &quot;Bosnian Muslims&quot;). Traditional religious symbols were used during the wars. Notably, foreign Muslim volunteers came to Bosnia to wage &quot;jihad&quot; and were thus known as &quot;Bosnian mujahideen&quot;. Although some news media and some scholars at the time and in the aftermath often described the conflicts as nationalist or ethnic in nature, others such as the literary critic Christopher Hitchens (2007) have argued that they were religious wars (Catholic versus Orthodox versus Islamic), and that terms such as &quot;Serb&quot; and &quot;Croat&quot; were employed as mere euphemisms to conceal the religious core of the armed conflicts, even though the term &quot;Muslims&quot; was frequently used. Some scholars have stated that they &quot;were not religious wars&quot;, but acknowledged that &quot;religion played an important role in the wars&quot; and &quot;did often serve as the motivating and integrating factor for justifying military attacks&quot;.

===Sudanese Civil War===
The Second Sudanese Civil War from 1983 to 2005 has been described as an ethnoreligious conflict where the Muslim central government&#x27;s pursuits to impose sharia law on non-Muslim southerners led to violence, and eventually to the civil war. The war resulted in the independence of South Sudan six years after the war ended. Sudan is majority-Muslim and South Sudan is majority-Christian.

<doc id="725531" wikidata="Q1879274" url="?curid=725531" title="6th Division (Australia)">
<text>The 6th Division was an infantry division of the Australian Army. It was raised briefly in 1917 during World War I, but was broken up to provide reinforcements before seeing action. It was not re-raised until the outbreak of World War II, when it was formed as a unit of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Throughout 1940–41 it served in the North African Campaign, the Greek campaign, on Crete and in Syria, fighting against the Germans, Italians and Vichy French. In 1942, the division left the Middle East and returned to Australia to meet the threat of Japan&#x27;s entry into the war. Part of the division garrisoned Ceylon for a short period of time, before the division was committed to the New Guinea campaign. In New Guinea, its component brigades had a major role in the successful counter-offensive along the Kokoda Track, at Buna–Gona and around Salamaua–Lae in 1942–43. Throughout late 1943–44, the division was re-organised in Australia before being committed as a complete formation to one of the last Australian operations of the war around Aitape–Wewak in 1944–45.
==History==

===Formation===
The 6th Division was first formed in 1917 in Britain during World War I as part of an effort to expand the First Australian Imperial Force. Its existence was short-lived, though, and as a result of manpower shortages that occurred because of a failure to make good the heavy losses that the AIF had suffered on the Western Front in 1917, it was decided to disband the division and its subordinate units in September 1917 and use their personnel to reinforce other units. As a result, the division was broken-up as replacements several months later, before it saw action.

The division was not re-raised during the interwar years and subsequently remained off the Australian Army&#x27;s order of battle until World War II broke out. Due to the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act&quot;, which precluded the five existing Militia divisions from serving overseas, the government decided to raise an all-volunteer force known as the 2nd AIF. The 6th Division was the first division formed within the 2nd AIF, being raised on 28 September 1939. Initially under the command of Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey, upon formation the division consisted of the 16th, 17th and 18th Brigades, each established with four infantry battalions. Later, though, it was reorganised as a result of the 18th Brigade being sent to the United Kingdom in June 1940 and the decision to adopt the British establishment of three infantry battalions to a brigade. The 19th Brigade was subsequently raised as the division&#x27;s third infantry brigade, being formed by taking one battalion from each of the other three brigades when they were reduced from four to three. Of the division&#x27;s infantry battalions, all except one – the 2/11th – were raised in either New South Wales or Victoria.

In early 1940, the majority of the 6th Division was sent to Palestine, to complete their training before joining the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. Together with the 7th Division they formed the Australian I Corps. However, France fell to German forces in July 1940, before I Corps arrived. While the rest of the division was training in the Middle East, the division&#x27;s third artillery regiment, the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 2/1st Anti-tank Regiment were sent to the United Kingdom to help bolster the garrison there in light of an expected invasion following the Fall of France. After being partially broken up to provide personnel to serve as infantry in the 25th Brigade, once the threat of invasion was over these two regiments were sent to the Middle East to rejoin the division, arriving there in December 1940.

===North Africa===
The 6th Division first saw action in early 1941, against Italian forces in North Africa, in the advance to Benghazi as part of Operation Compass. By this time, Major General Iven Mackay had taken over command of the division. In June 1940, Italy had declared war on the Allies and began to build up forces in Libya. In September 1940, the Italian Tenth Army invaded Egypt, a British colony, threatening Allied control of the Middle East and most particularly, the Suez Canal and international supply routes. British forces under General Sir Archibald Wavell expelled the Italians from Sidi Barrani and pursued them back towards the Libyan border. In December 1940, the 6th Division was moved forward from training camps around Alexandria to relieve British troops around Bardia and at the end of December they were ordered to prepare to attack.

On 3 January 1941, at Bardia, a small coastal town just inside the Libyan border, the first major Australian action of World War II took place. Amidst a heavy artillery barrage and supported by British Matilda tanks and Bren carriers of the divisional cavalry, the 6th Division penetrated the defences of the Italian stronghold. Despite some heavy resistance the town fell to the Australians just two days later. The Australians captured a large amount of Italian war material as well as thousands of Italian prisoners of war (POWs), many of whom were shipped to prison camps in Australia. The fighting continued until 5 January when the Italian position had been cut almost into two. The Allies took nearly 40,000 Italian prisoners and considerable amounts of enemy weapons, supplies and equipment. The battle for Bardia cost 130 Australian lives with 326 men wounded.

On 22 January 1941, the Italian held port of Tobruk fell to the AIF and 25,000 Italians became prisoners. During January and February 1941, the 6th Division, together with British units, pushed the Italian army back across Libya, including actions at Derna, Barce and Benghazi. The Italian Tenth Army was destroyed. Although Wavell initially planned to leave the 6th Division in Cyrenaica for defence, the 7th Division was still insufficiently trained and equipped. As such in early April 1941, the 6th Division was withdrawn from North Africa to defend Greece and replaced by the 9th Division, which took part in the epic Siege of Tobruk between April and November 1941 against Italian and German forces. Throughout the campaign, the division lost 241 killed, 790 wounded and 21 captured.

===Greece, Crete and Syria===
Hitler was concerned that if Greece—which since 28 October 1940 was fighting against the Italians in Albania—became a British ally then the Ploesti oilfields in Romania, on which Germany relied for her fuel, might be open to air attack from Greece. As the Germans were planning an invasion of Russia for June 1941, they could not allow such a threat to their essential oil supplies, and so they began planning an invasion of Greece. In March 1941, Prime Minister Robert Menzies, of Australia, with the concurrence of his Cabinet, agreed to the sending of Australian troops to Greece to defend against a German attack. Both Menzies and the I Corps commander, Blamey, felt that the operation was risky and might end in disaster, but Menzies stated that Greece should be supported against German aggression and that the defence of Greece was a &quot;great risk in a good cause&quot;.

The 6th Division arrived in Greece in late March and early April 1941, where they joined with a New Zealand and British force. On 6 April the Germans began their invasion of Greece, sending a total of 27 divisions. After arriving in Greece, the Australians were transported north towards the Yugoslav border, where they took up defensive positions around the Florina Valley. During the fighting around Vevi that followed, troops from the 2/4th and 2/8th Infantry Battalions and the 2/3rd Field Regiment, from Brigadier George Vasey&#x27;s 19th Brigade, fought against the &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; brigade. Despite their efforts, the Allied force, together with Greek units, was unable to halt the rapid German advance down central Greece towards Athens. The Allies were outflanked by the Germans, and by 27 April they were driven off the Greek mainland, with a final act of defiance being made around Porto Rafti. The division&#x27;s casualties in Greece amounted to 320 killed, 494 wounded and 2,030 captured.

After the withdrawal from Greece, while some elements of the division were evacuated back to Alexandria, the majority of the 6th Division was sent to Crete where they were cobbled together to form a hasty garrison. The 19th Brigade had been landed intact with all of its infantry battalions, while only elements of the 16th and 17th Brigades had been landed and these two were combined to form composite battalions. In addition to the infantry, two of the division&#x27;s field artillery units, the 2/2nd and 2/3rd Field Regiments had also been landed. They had both lost all of their equipment in Greece and as a result the 2/2nd were thrown into the line as infantry, while the 2/3rd were hastily re-equipped with 14 captured French and Italian artillery pieces. On 20 May, the Germans launched an airborne assault on the island and over the course of a week-and-a-half heavy fighting ensued around Maleme airfield, Heraklion, Canea, and Retimo during which heavy casualties were inflicted upon the Germans before, having exhausted their ammunition and lacking air support, the garrison was evacuated back to Egypt close to the end of the month. As in Greece, a large number of men were unable to be evacuated and as a result many 6th Division personnel, including the majority of the 2/1st, 2/7th and 2/11th Battalions, were taken prisoner. A great deal of equipment was also lost. During the fighting, the 2/7th Infantry Battalion, fighting alongside the New Zealand 28th (Maori) Battalion, undertook a bayonet charge at a position known as 42nd Street that was later described as &quot;one of the epics of the war&quot;, which resulted in about 300 Germans being killed. The fighting on Crete added a further 274 killed, 507 wounded and 3,102 captured to the division&#x27;s casualty list.

While the majority of the division was in Crete, the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment, which had not been sent to Greece, was detached to the British 7th Armoured Brigade and subsequently took part in Operation Brevity in the Western Desert in May. Following the evacuation of Crete, while the 6th Division began rebuilding in Palestine, the cavalry was allocated to take part in the bloody but successful attack on Vichy French forces in the Syria-Lebanon campaign. Two depleted infantry battalions from the 17th Brigade – the 2/3rd and 2/5th – were also committed and subsequently took part in the drive on Damascus in mid-June. They were later joined by the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion and together they fought through the campaign until the French capitulated in mid-July. In the process they suffered 168 casualties; total 6th Division casualties for the Syrian campaign amounted to 39 killed and 129 wounded.

After the conclusion of the fighting in Syria, the rest of the 6th Division joined the 17th Brigade and undertook garrison duties there. In December 1941, the division received news that the Japanese had attacked on Pearl Harbor and invaded Malaya. Nevertheless, the division remained in Syria over Christmas, during which time they endured a bitterly cold winter that saw heavy snow falls. Finally, in January 1942, the decision was made to withdraw them back to Australia to meet threat posed by Japanese advances in the Pacific. The 19th Brigade departed first and subsequently arrived at Fremantle on 10 March. Meanwhile, the 16th and 17th Brigades were diverted to defend Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) from the Japanese. They remained there from mid-March through to early July 1942.

===The Pacific War===

====Return to Australia====
While the 16th and 17th Brigades were in Ceylon, the 19th Brigade had proceeded from Fremantle to Adelaide in mid-March, where they remained until April due to a short period of leave being granted. Once the men reported back, the brigade was split up, with the 2/11th Infantry Battalion sent to Western Australia to undertake garrison duty while the brigade&#x27;s other infantry battalions and the divisional cavalry regiment were sent to the Northern Territory to bolster its defences in the wake of Japanese successes; the 19th Brigade would subsequently not see any combat for another three-and-a-half years. While there, the 2/11th&#x27;s place within the 19th Brigade was taken by a Militia unit, the 23rd/21st Battalion. At the same time, many of the division&#x27;s experienced officers and non-commissioned officers were transferred out to Militia units to prepare them for operations against the Japanese. The 6th Division headquarters was subsequently used to form Headquarters, Northern Territory Force in April, and does not appear to have officially been reformed in its own right until August or September. In June, one the division&#x27;s artillery regiments, the 2/3rd was transferred to the 5th Division. Having spent nearly six months in Ceylon, the 16th and 17th Brigades arrived back in Australia in August and they subsequently returned to their states of origin. After a brief period of leave, welcome home parades were held in Sydney for the 16th and in Melbourne for the 17th. Less than a week later, the 6th Division received orders to deploy overseas again, this time to meet the Japanese southward thrust through New Guinea. After this, the division would spend the remainder of the war fighting elements of the Japanese XVII Army in New Guinea and until the final year of the war, it would do so in individual brigade-level components, rather than as a unified command.

====Kokoda to Buna–Gona====
In mid-September 1942, the 16th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier John Lloyd, and other elements of the division were sent to New Guinea to reinforce and relieve the Militia 30th Brigade and the 7th Division units that had been fighting a desperate holding action on the Kokoda Track since July. The campaign to that point had consisted of a series of battles fought along the track after the Japanese had landed around Buna and pushed south towards Port Moresby, but were checked at Ioribaiwa. The divisional headquarters opened at Port Moresby on 19 September and the 16th Brigade arrived three days later; the 17th Brigade was sent to Milne Bay, to relieve the 18th Brigade following the successful defensive action they had fought earlier in the month. As the Japanese, having reached the extent of their supply lines, began to withdraw from Ioribaiwa, the Australians went on the offensive, pursuing them back north towards Buna.

On 17 October, the 16th Brigade was detached to the 7th Division&#x27;s command and moved up the track. It subsequently took over the advance from the exhausted troops of the 25th Brigade three days later. The Japanese had established themselves in strong positions on the high ground north of Eora Creek. For the next week-and-a-half, the brigade fought desperately against the terrain, driving rain, and cold, inhospitable conditions to outflank these positions. Making heavy work of it against strong resistance, the Australians slowly made headway, but the Japanese remained in possession of the citadel. Finally, on 28 October when the 2/3rd Infantry Battalion took the Japanese right flank, killing 50 and forcing the remaining defenders into a headlong retreat. In securing the crossing, the brigade had suffered almost 300 casualties. Suffering from disease and with rations running low, the brigade continued along the eastern fork of the track. Amidst almost no opposition, they took Missima and passed through Kobara before setting out for Wairopi by 4 November.

Heavy resistance was encountered that day as the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion advanced towards the high ground around Oivi. They were held up for a number of days until outflanking moves by the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, temporarily detached to the 25th Brigade, pushed the Japanese back and enabled the brigade to continue its advance. Gorari was taken and by mid-November the brigade, having suffered 471 battle casualties since the being committed to the fighting around Kokoda, finally reached Wairopi, where the swollen Kumusi River was forded.

After crossing the Kumusi, the 16th Brigade was ordered to move towards Sanananda Point to support the joint Australian–US effort to attack the Japanese beachheads around the Buna–Gona area. The ration situation had grown worse by this time, and progress was slow as the march proved too difficult for many of the soldiers in their weakened physical states. Nevertheless, by 18 November, the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion had led the brigade into Popondetta, after which the 2/3rd moved into the vanguard. For the next two days they experienced almost no opposition until 21 November when Japanese artillery began to target the 2/1st. Launching a quick attack with three companies, the 2/1st outflanked the Japanese gun pit with two companies while the third provided support-by-fire. In the rout that followed over 80 Japanese were killed. By nightfall, the 2/1st, which had dug-in and subsequently fought off a number of Japanese counterattacks, was relieved from the forward position just a few kilometres from the coast. The brigade had been severely depleted in reaching the position and at that point had only 1,040 fit men, so they were ordered to hold their position along the front to provide cover to troops of the US 126th Infantry Regiment, which was slowly moving towards the Soputa–Sanananda–Cape Killerton track junction. On 23 November, the 16th Brigade finally received artillery support, after a battery from the 2/1st Field Regiment was flown into the hastily established airfield at Popondetta and began firing upon Sananada. The inexperienced American regiment made very slow progress and as a result, the 16th Brigade held their position until 6 December, when they were progressively relieved by troops from the 30th Brigade, having suffered over 85 per cent casualties. The 2/3rd Infantry Battalion was the last out, being withdrawn on the night of 19/20 December.

Meanwhile, a small element of the division remained in action until Sanananda fell in late January 1943. The 2/1st Field Regiment&#x27;s detachment at Popondetta was expanded to a full troop of four guns, while another troop was sent to support the US forces around Buna and a third force was sent to Oro Bay. In addition to these artillery assets, in October a small group of five Bren carriers from the 17th Brigade&#x27;s carrier platoon had been sent from Milne Bay to support the General Robert Eichelberger&#x27;s 32nd Division. With crews drawn mainly from the 2/7th Infantry Battalion and one from the 2/5th, they were thrown into action around Buna on 5 December to support a major assault and, despite making some headway against the heavily entrenched Japanese, were wiped out with heavy casualties. During the 6th Division&#x27;s involvement in the campaign, it lost 207 killed and 397 wounded.

====Wau–Salamaua====

As the 16th Brigade&#x27;s involvement in its first New Guinea campaign was being fought to a successful conclusion around the beachheads between Buna and Gona, the 17th Brigade was preparing for its first encounter with the Japanese. Shortly after the Japanese landings around Salamaua and Lae in March 1942 a small band of commandos known as &quot;Kanga Force&quot; had established themselves around Wau and in May commenced a seven-month guerilla campaign in the area. In early January 1943, the Japanese heavily reinforced the Salamaua–Lae area, moving 4,000 troops from both Guadalcanal and Papua where they had suffered setbacks, in the hope of destroying Kanga Force, capturing the Wau, which lay in the strategically important Bulolo Valley, which offered the Allies an airstrip that could serve as a &quot;potential springboard&quot; that could be used to move large concentrations of troops over the Owen Stanley Range to attack the Japanese bases at Salamaua and Lae.

Throughout the fighting around Kokoda and Buna–Gona, the 17th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Murray Moten, had been kept back at Milne Bay by Australian commanders with the intention of keeping them fresh to reinforce the garrison at Wau. While at Milne Bay, the brigade had been significantly reduced by sickness, specifically malaria; however, in response to the arrival of Japanese reinforcements at Lae, the 17th Brigade was relieved at Milne Bay by the 29th Brigade and, after being shipped to Port Moresby, on 14 January, one company of the 2/6th Infantry Battalion, representing the brigade&#x27;s advanced elements, was flown into Wau on six US C-47 Dakotas. Upon arrival, the company – &#x27;B&#x27; Company – began moving towards Mubo, where they were to link up with the commandos there and establish themselves to defend the Bulolo Valley. Amidst difficult flying conditions and limited resources, the arrival of the rest of the battalion took place over the following four days, while the rest of the brigade was also delayed. On 20 January the Japanese began moving small groups towards Mubo with the intention of taking Wau, and in response the 2/5th Infantry Battalion was dispatched on 24 January, arriving over the course of the next three days.

On the morning of 28 January, at Wandumi, the main Japanese thrust fell upon the 70-man strong &#x27;A&#x27; Company, 2/6th Infantry Battalion. Throughout the day the company fought desperately to hold the Japanese while reinforcements from the 2/5th were brought up from Wau; in the mid-afternoon, as it looked like they would be overrun, a desperate bayonet charge temporarily bought the Australians some relief and they eventually withdrew about a mile to the south-west, back towards the Bulolo River where they formed a night defensive position, having successfully delayed the Japanese advance and inflicted over 75 killed upon them. Throughout the following day, as poor weather hampered efforts to fly in the 2/7th Infantry Battalion, a large group of about 500 Japanese bypassed &#x27;A&#x27; Company&#x27;s position and continued on towards Wau. In response two companies of the 2/5th were moved to the airstrip, reaching there early on 29 January just before Japanese mortars began firing on it. By mid-morning, however, the weather cleared and Allied aircraft soon began arriving at the airfield, disgorging men from the 2/7th who were quickly thrown into the line. That night several counterattacks were fought off and the following day, as a section of guns from the 2/1st Field Regiment arrived, the 17th Brigade went on the offensive. A company of machine guns from the 7th Machine Gun Battalion was also flown in. By 5 February the Japanese began withdrawing from the area. Significant fighting occurred on 9 February, and over the course of the next three weeks further clashes took place as the Australians followed up the retreating Japanese. The last actions came around Buibaining and Waipali and by 26 February the withdrawal was complete with the Japanese establishing themselves around Guadagasal and Mubo.

Following this, the 17th Brigade advanced towards Guadagasal, but after supply problems ground this to a halt, throughout March and April a series of patrols were sent out towards Mubo. By late April the brigade was detached to the 3rd Division, a primarily Militia formation, which took up the task of defending Wau. Throughout this time, engineers from the 6th Division, including the 2/1st Field Company, would to improve supply lines throughout the area, cutting a road to Wau. The 2/2nd Field Ambulance also provided support to the brigade&#x27;s operations, establishing medical services close to the Australian forward areas.

Between 22 April and 29 May 1943, the 2/7th Infantry Battalion, at the end of a long and tenuous supply line, unsuccessfully attacked the southern extremity of Japanese lines, the Mubo area, at features known to the Allies as &quot;The Pimple&quot; and &quot;Green Hill&quot;, north of Lababia Ridge. In early May, over the course of two days, the 2/7th repelled eight strong Japanese counterattacks, before being relieved. At the same time, the Allies began planning wider operations to capture Lae. As a part of this, Salamaua was also to be taken. Initially, the 3rd Division was to secure Nassau Bay and the 17th Brigade was to capture Mubo and push north towards Mount Tambu to secure Komiatum.

Moving over steep, muddy ridges amidst dense, fetid jungle terrain the 2/7th found the going tough and by late May the 2/6th took over the drive towards Nassau Bay. Feeling their way from Lababia Ridge they located a traversable path through the jungle towards the coast but on 20 June, &#x27;D&#x27; Company came under heavy attack from two Japanese battalions from the 66th Regiment, amounting to 1,500 men, and for three days intense fighting followed before the Japanese were successfully beaten back. The Australians relied on well-established and linked defensive positions, featuring extensive, cleared free-fire zones. The battle was later described as one of the Australian Army&#x27;s &quot;classic engagements&quot; of World War II.

By the end of the month the 2/6th had reached Nassau Bay where it secured landing beaches for an amphibious landing by US troops from the 162nd Regimental Combat Team. Once established, the 2/6th then led the way back west towards Bitoi Ridge, ranging ahead of the Americans as the Allies began to encircle Mubo. In early July, the 2/7th attacked Observation Hill and as the Japanese began to withdraw from Mubo, the 2/5th was sent north to act in support of the newly arrived Militia 15th Brigade, which was moving on Bobdubi Ridge. In mid-July, amidst heavy close-quarters fighting, the 2/5th Infantry Battalion captured the southern parts of Mount Tambu.

Throughout late July a situation of stalemate developed on Mount Tambu, which held up the Australian advance. As a result, Moten decided to bypass it in early August, sending the 2/6th Battalion north-west towards Komiatum. A path was eventually found and after securing Laver&#x27;s Knoll, the Australians began working around behind Mount Tambu, towards the northern end of Bobdubi Ridge. The 2/7th was heavily involved with the 15th Brigade at this time, fighting to take a position known as &quot;The Coconuts&quot;. Finally, as the noose around Mount Tambu tightened, the Japanese abandoned it on 19 August.

The 17th Brigade&#x27;s advance continued for the next two days until, when the brigade had reached the final ridge before Salamaua, the 29th Brigade arrived to take over. The 2/7th Infantry Battalion, however, still detached to the 15th Brigade, continued on with them and as a result remained in the thick of it until the end when Salamaua fell on 20 September. Meanwhile, the rest of the 17th Brigade was on its way back to Australia and by mid-September, it arrived on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland where it was once again was placed under the 6th Division&#x27;s command. The Wau–Salamaua campaign cost the 6th Division 240 killed and 520 wounded.

A long period of waiting and training followed. Throughout 1943–44, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw a reduction in the division&#x27;s artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength falling from around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted and moved on to other formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division&#x27;s next deployment would not come until November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once again they would be unified as a full division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.

====Aitape–Wewak campaign====

The Japanese had occupied the Aitape–Wewak area in northern New Guinea in 1942 and had held it until April 1944 when the Americans had undertaken an amphibious landing around Aitape. Later in the year, responsibility for clearing the remaining Japanese troops from the area was passed to the Australians as the US sought to reallocate its troops towards retaking the Philippines. From early October, the 6th Division began to take over from US troops, with the first unit to arrive being the 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment, which had been formed in early 1943 when the division&#x27;s cavalry regiment had been converted into a headquarters formation for three commando squadrons: the 2/7th, 2/9th and 2/10th. The 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion was also assigned as a corps unit for the campaign. As a result of shortages in available shipping, the rest of the division arrived slowly over the course of a couple of months. Starting in December, the division commenced a limited offensive, advancing towards the main Japanese base at Wewak along the coast and through the Torricelli Mountains to Maprik, which the Japanese had been using for sustainment, having established a number of gardens there.

With the 19th Brigade and the 2/7th Commando Squadron leading off along the coast route in December and the 17th Brigade with the 2/10th moving into the Torricellis, a series of small-scale actions followed. In mid-January, the 19th Brigade was relieved by the 16th and the 2/9th Commando Squadron, which continued the drive along the coast, while in the Torricellis, the 17th Brigade&#x27;s infantry battalions took turns leading the way with the commandos. The closed terrain hindered the movement of supplies from the rear areas and consequently the Australians made slow progress. The dense jungle also limited the size of the forces that could be deployed, with the largest formations being sent out by the division being limited to company size at this time. Isolated pockets of Japanese offered significant resistance in places, which had to be overcome with artillery, air and tank support, while daily patrols risked ambush and attacks from snipers. The elements also posed a significant threat to the Australians, with many men drowning when they attempted to cross the flood-swollen rivers. Nevertheless, Maprik was taken on 23 April, as was Wewak, which fell on 11 May. Operations in the area continued through to the end of the war as the Australians exploited south from Maprik towards Nungagua, and east towards Kiarivu; after taking Wewak, the coastal route was expanded east towards the Brandi Plantation, while patrols ranged inland towards Sauri and Mount Shiburangu.

During the campaign, two members of the division performed actions for which they were later awarded the Victoria Cross, the Commonwealth&#x27;s highest gallantry decoration. The first of these was awarded posthumously to Lieutenant Albert Chowne of the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion for his courage and leadership while commanding a platoon on 25 March around Dagua. The second went to Private Edward Kenna, of the 2/4th Infantry Battalion, for destroying several Japanese bunkers that were holding up his company&#x27;s advance around the Wirui Mission. The campaign was also significant for the distance that the division travelled. After landing, they traversed over inland and along the coast. In doing so the 6th Division captured . Over 9,000 Japanese were killed and 264 captured. Against this the division suffered its highest casualties of the war, losing 442 killed, 1,141 wounded and over 16,000 men being hospitalised with sickness.

===Disbandment===
On 13 September, the division took the formal surrender of the XVII Army&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, at Cape Wom airstrip. After this, the division remained in New Guinea as its constituent units were slowly demobilised. As transport shortages delayed the process, the division was employed on garrison duties and aiding war crimes investigations. Finally, by November 1945, most of the 6th Division&#x27;s units had returned to Australia and the division was formally disbanded; the majority of the division&#x27;s infantry battalions were disbanded shortly afterwards in the early months of 1946. During its six-year existence, a total of about 40,000 men served in the division&#x27;s ranks. Of these, 1,763 were killed in action or died, a further 3,978 were wounded and a total of 5,153 men became prisoners of war.

==Structure==
The 6th Division&#x27;s structure changed considerably during its existence with units being detached or attached to meet operational needs. This was particularly so during early 1942 and late 1943. Below is a divisional order of battle that is indicative of its generic make up. In addition to those listed, during 1942–43, the 14th, 21st, 25th and 30th Brigades were also attached, albeit temporarily for varying periods.

<text>Stakeford is a large village in south east Northumberland, England.

Its about north of Newcastle upon Tyne. It lies south of the River Wansbeck from Ashington, the nearest town. The village takes its name from the former river crossing to the north of the village, this was a crossing through the mudflats which was marked with stakes to give an idea of the water depth, hence the name Stakeford. The river crossing has long gone, but remains of the stakes can be seen in the river bed becoming visible whenever the dam downstream is opened. The old river crossing was replaced by a bridge in the early 20th century, which in itself was replaced by the new Stakeford Bridge in 1994. There is now no trace of the original ford due to the mudflats being used as a landfill site in the 1950s and 60s and the creation of a riverside country park in the 1970s.

It is a mainly residential village. There are three pubs and a Social Club. There is also a miners&#x27; institute although it never had a mine as this was located in the adjacent village of Bomarsund. Stakeford has several shops and a primary school. Today Stakeford forms one built-up area, with neighbouring Guide Post and Sheepwash.

== Notable people ==
* John Trewick, professional footballer for Newcastle United in the early 1980s
* Mick Harrison and Tim Pattison, bassist and drummer for Leicester-based &#x27;90s indie/punk rock/krautrock/shoegaze band, Prolapse (band), grew up in Stakeford
* Darren Allison, record producer and musician.

==Governance==
The village is in Choppington parish. It also has an electoral ward in its own name. This is mainly a ward of Choppington but includes a portion of East Bedlington. The total ward population taken at the 2011 Census was 4,672.

<text>The phrase Protestant Wind has been used in more than one context, notably:

#The storm that lashed the Spanish Armada in 1588. The wind wrecked the Spanish fleet and thus saved England from invasion by the army of Philip II of Spain. The English made a commemorative medal saying &#x27;He blew with His winds, and they were scattered&#x27;.

<doc id="725555" wikidata="Q107486" url="?curid=725555" title="8 Flora">
<text>8 Flora is a large, bright main-belt asteroid. It is the innermost &quot;large&quot; asteroid: no asteroid closer to the Sun has a diameter above 25 kilometers (20% that of Flora), and not until 20-km 149 Medusa was discovered was an asteroid known to orbit at a closer mean distance. It is the seventh-brightest asteroid with a mean opposition magnitude of +8.7. Flora can reach a magnitude of +8.1 at a favorable opposition near perihelion, such as occurred in November 2020 when it was from Earth.

==Discovery and naming==
Flora was discovered by J. R. Hind on 18 October 1847. It was his second asteroid discovery after 7 Iris.

The name Flora was proposed by John Herschel, from Flora, the Latin goddess of flowers and gardens, wife of Zephyrus (the personification of the West wind), and mother of Spring. The Greek equivalent is Chloris, who has her own asteroid, 410 Chloris, but in Greek 8 Flora is also called 8 Chloris (8 Χλωρίς).
The old iconic symbol for 8 Flora has been variously rendered as , , etc. It is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC2 𜻂 ().

==Characteristics==

Lightcurve analysis indicates that Flora&#x27;s pole points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (16°, 160°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of 78°, plus or minus ten degrees.

Flora is the parent body of the Flora family of asteroids, and by far the largest member, comprising about 80% of the total mass of this family. Nevertheless, Flora was almost certainly disrupted by the impact(s) that formed the family, and is probably a gravitational aggregate of most of the pieces.

Flora&#x27;s spectrum indicates that its surface composition is a mixture of silicate rock (including pyroxene and olivine) and nickel-iron metal. Flora, and the whole Flora family generally, are good candidates for being the parent bodies of the L chondrite meteorites. This meteorite type comprises 35% of meteorites impacting the Earth.

==Observational history ==
During an observation on 25 March 1917, 8 Flora was mistaken for the 15th-magnitude star TU Leonis, which led to that star&#x27;s classification as a U Geminorum cataclysmic variable star. Flora had come to opposition on 1917 February 13, 40 days earlier. This mistake was uncovered only in 1995.

On 26 July 2013, Flora at magnitude 8.8 occulted the star 2UCAC 22807162 over parts of South America, Africa, and Asia.

==Popular culture==
In the 1968 science-fiction film &quot;The Green Slime&quot;, an orbital perturbation propels the asteroid Flora into a collision course with Earth.

In 1995, Bruce Schneier commented, &quot;It is read by an estimated 100,000 people worldwide. Most of the posts are nonsense, bickering, or both; some are political, and most of the rest are requests for information or basic questions. Occasionally nuggets of new and useful information are posted to this newsgroup.&quot;

Leaked descriptions of secret algorithms have been posted to the Internet via sci.crypt, for example RC2, RC4 and Khufu and Khafre. Others have been hoaxes: Iraqi block cipher and S-1, the latter an alleged description of the (then-secret) Skipjack cipher. The group is also the origin of the term, &quot;Rubber-hose cryptanalysis&quot;.

<doc id="725558" wikidata="Q5233732" url="?curid=725558" title="David Ford (politician)">
<text>David Ford (born 24 February 1951) is a former Northern Irish politician, who was leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland from October 2001 until October 2016 and was Northern Ireland Minister of Justice from April 2010 until May 2016. He was a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for South Antrim from 1998 to 2018.

==Early life==

Ford was born on 24 February 1951 to Irish and Welsh parents and grew up in Orpington, Kent, England. Ford was educated at Warren Road Primary School, Orpington and Dulwich College, London. He spent summer holidays on his uncle&#x27;s farm in Gortin, County Tyrone, and moved to Northern Ireland permanently in 1969 when he went to study Economics at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (QUB). There he joined the university&#x27;s student Alliance Party grouping. After graduating, Ford took a year out to work as a volunteer at the ecumenical Corrymeela Community in Ballycastle, County Antrim, before starting work as a social worker in 1973.

==Political career==

Ford stood unsuccessfully for Antrim Borough Council in 1989, and entered politics full-time when he became general secretary of the Alliance Party. In that role, he was best known as a strong supporter of the then-leader John Alderdice and an advocate of better political organisation and community politics. He was elected to Antrim Borough Council in 1993, 1997 and – after leaving the Council in 2001 to concentrate on Assembly business – again in 2005.

In 1996, Ford stood unsuccessfully for election to the Northern Ireland Forum in South Antrim. In 1997, he obtained 12% of the vote in the general election in South Antrim, and in 1998 was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in the constituency of the same name. He fought South Antrim again in the 2000 by-election and in the 2001 and 2005 general elections.

==Alliance Party leadership==

In 2001, Seán Neeson resigned from the Party leadership following poor election results. David Ford won the leadership election on 6 October by 86 votes to 45, ahead of Eileen Bell. Ford outlined his internationalist view point in his speech at the leadership selection when he said:I am keen to co-operate with other non-sectarian groups in Northern Ireland, including political parties that will stand against the tribal divide. Our links to the South are not as good as they should be, either with the PDs or with Fine Gael, where we have many natural allies.

We must also recognise that Northern Ireland is not unique in the world.

Our stand is not different in substance from those who work for peace and reconciliation in Cyprus, Palestine or Bosnia. We should learn from friends abroad. To suggest that &#x27;our wee province&#x27; is unique is to do a disservice. There is little more objectionable than the sight of the political begging bowl being dragged out by sectional politicians.

Ford gave Alliance a stability which it had lacked since the departure of John Alderdice, but the Party had declined seriously in the late 1990s and all Ford could do was stabilise the situation. Within a month of taking over the leadership, however, Ford had a chance to establish Alliance&#x27;s relevancy in the post-Good Friday Agreement environment – on 6 November 2001, the Northern Ireland Executive was to be re-established. Due to defections within his own Ulster Unionist Party, First Minister David Trimble, had insufficient support within the Unionist bloc in the Assembly to be re-elected to his post. Ford and two of his five colleagues re-designated as Unionist, for just 22 minutes, in order to secure Trimble&#x27;s position, and thereby enabled the devolved institutions to operate for another year. However, Alliance failed to make any political gains from their move, and the UUP and Sinn Féin failed to reach agreement on the decommissioning issue, ensuring that the institutions collapsed again in October 2002.

In the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections of 2003, Ford&#x27;s seat in the Assembly was perceived to be under severe threat from Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin Meehan, with many commentators expecting him to lose it. However, Ford&#x27;s expertise in nuts and bolts electioneering stood him in good stead. Although Alliance&#x27;s vote almost halved, Ford&#x27;s own vote in South Antrim increased from 8.6% to 9.1%. Meehan&#x27;s vote increased dramatically, from 7.3% to 11.5%, and he started the election count ahead. Ford had much greater transfer appeal and finished 180 votes ahead of Meehan at the end of a dramatic three-way fight for the last two seats, with the SDLP&#x27;s Thomas Burns just 14 votes ahead of Ford. Despite the dramatic fall in vote, Alliance held on to its six seats in the Assembly, which remained suspended.

In 2004, Ford made good his leadership election pledge to work with other parties, as Alliance joined with the Workers&#x27; Party, Northern Ireland Conservatives and elements of the Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition to support Independent candidate John Gilliland in the European elections, achieving the best result for the centre ground for 25 years.

Ford&#x27;s greatest triumph came in the 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election, when the party achieved its highest vote share since Alderdice&#x27;s departure and picked up a seat in what was an otherwise poor election for the moderates. Despite media predictions once again of his demise, Ford himself was elected third in South Antrim, with over 13% of the poll. In the 2011 Assembly elections, the Alliance Party managed to increase their vote by 50% gaining an extra seat in East Belfast and surpassing the Ulster Unionist Party in Belfast.

Ford announced his resignation as Leader in Oct 2016 on the fifteenth anniversary of his election as leader noting &quot;The team is working well and I think it&#x27;s an appropriate time to hand over to a new leader who will lead the party forward in the next stage of its development and growth.&quot;

==Northern Ireland Justice Minister==
On 12 April 2010, Ford was chosen by the Assembly to become Northern Ireland&#x27;s first Justice Minister in 38 years. Ford was supported in the Assembly by the DUP, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Green Party and the Progressive Unionist Party. Separate candidates for the position were put forward by both the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP, being Danny Kennedy and Alban McGuinness respectively. Referencing the election, Ford said, &quot;I am fully conscious that I am not the unanimous choice of this assembly but I do say to every member of this house, that we have a duty together to provide leadership and if we didn&#x27;t know that before, we sadly had a reminder of it at half past twelve this morning.&quot;

==Personal life==
David Ford and his wife Anne have four grown-up children and live in rural County Antrim. Until the spring of 2013, he was an elder in the Second Donegore congregation of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. He was removed from his role as a ruling elder over differences with fellow congregants on the subject of gay marriage. In a 2016 interview Ford said he was still hurt by the decision by his fellow elders who chose not to work with him because of his support for equal marriage &quot;It saddened me that there was, if I may put it, a lack of understanding from some people about the role I had as a legislator, compared to the role I have within the church.&quot;

<doc id="725569" wikidata="Q551587" url="?curid=725569" title="Anjuta">
<text>Anjuta was an integrated development environment written for the GNOME project. It had support for C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and Vala programming language. In May 2022, the project was archived due to a lack of maintainers. Since October 2022 the project&#x27;s former homepage no longer exists and the domain is owned by an SBOBET, an Indonesian gambling website. It has been superseded by GNOME Builder.

==Anjuta DevStudio==
The goal of Anjuta DevStudio was to provide a customizable and extensible IDE framework and at the same time provide implementations of common development tools. Libanjuta was the framework that realizes the Anjuta IDE plugin framework and Anjuta DevStudio realizes many of the common development plugins.

It integrated programming tools such as the Glade Interface Designer and the Devhelp API help browser.

==Features==
Anjuta features:
* Interactive debugger built over GDB and integrated compiler
* Source code editor with source browsing,
* code completion and syntax highlighting,
* Project management
* Application wizard
* CVS and Subversion version control system integration

==Reception==
The German magazine LinuxUser recognized Anjuta 1.0.0 (released in 2002) as a good step to increase the number of native GNOME/GTK applications, stating that the application has a very intuitive GUI and new useful features.

In April 2017, Anjuta was removed from the OpenBSD ports tree, with stagnation of development and existence of alternatives cited as reasons.

<doc id="725575" wikidata="Q107541" url="?curid=725575" title="9 Metis">
<text>9 Metis is one of the larger main-belt asteroids. It is composed of silicates and metallic nickel-iron, and may be the core remnant of a large asteroid that was destroyed by an ancient collision. Metis is estimated to contain just under half a percent of the total mass of the asteroid belt.

Metis passed within 0.034 AU, or , of Vesta on 19 August 2004.

==Discovery and naming==
Metis was discovered by Andrew Graham on 25 April 1848, at Markree Observatory in Ireland; it was his only asteroid discovery. It also has been the only asteroid to have been discovered as a result of observations from Ireland until 7 October 2008, when, 160 years later, Dave McDonald from observatory J65 discovered (281507) 2008 TM9. Its name comes from the mythological Metis, a Titaness and Oceanid, daughter of Tethys and Oceanus. The name &quot;Thetis&quot; was also considered and rejected (it would later devolve to 17 Thetis).

The historical symbol for Metis was an eye with a star above it. It is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC3 𜻃 ().

==Characteristics==

Metis&#x27; direction of rotation is unknown at present, due to ambiguous data. Lightcurve analysis indicates that the Metidian pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (23°, 181°) or (9°, 359°) with a 10° uncertainty. The equivalent equatorial coordinates are (α, δ) = (12.7 h, 21°) or (23.7 h, 8°). This gives an axial tilt of 72° or 76°, respectively.

Hubble Space Telescope images and lightcurve analyses are in agreement that Metis has an irregular elongated shape with one pointed and one broad end. Radar observations suggest the presence of a significant flat area, in agreement with the shape model from lightcurves.

The Metidian surface composition has been estimated as 30–40% metal-bearing olivine and 60–70% Ni-Fe metal.

Light curve data on Metis led to an assumption that it could have a satellite. However, subsequent observations failed to confirm this. Later searches with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993 found no satellites.

==Family relationships==
Metis was once considered to be a member of an asteroid family known as the Metis family, but more recent searches for prominent families did not recognize any such group, nor is a clump evident in the vicinity of Metis by visual inspection of proper orbital element diagrams.

However, a spectroscopic analysis found strong spectral similarities between Metis and 113 Amalthea, and it is suggested that these asteroids may be remnants of a very old (at least ~1 Ga) dynamical family whose smaller members have been pulverised by collisions or perturbed away from the vicinity. The putative parent body is estimated to have been 300 to 600 km in diameter (Vesta-sized) and differentiated. Metis would be the relatively intact core remnant (though smaller than 16 Psyche), and Amalthea a fragment of the mantle, with 90% of the original body unaccounted for. Coincidentally, both Metis and Amalthea have namesakes among Jupiter&#x27;s inner moons.

==Occultations==
In 1984 an occultation of a star produced seven chords that Kristensen used to derive an ellipsoidal profile of 210×170 km. On 6 August 1989, Metis occulted a magnitude 8.7 star producing five chords suggesting a diameter of 173.5 km. Observations of an occultation on 11 February 2006, produced only two chords indicating a minimum diameter 156 km. All three of these occultations fit the ellipsoid 222×182×130 km suggested by Baer.

On 7 March 2014, Metis occulted the star HIP 78193 (magnitude 7.9) over parts of Europe and the Middle East.

<doc id="725585" wikidata="Q2640" url="?curid=725585" title="10 Hygiea">
<text>10 Hygiea is a major asteroid located in the main asteroid belt. With a mean diameter of between km and a mass estimated to be 3% of the total mass of the belt, it is the fourth-largest asteroid in the Solar System by both volume and mass, and is the largest of the C-type asteroids (dark asteroids with a carbonaceous surface) in classifications that use G type for 1 Ceres. It is very close to spherical, apparently because it had re-accreted after the disruptive impact that produced the large Hygiean family of asteroids.

==Observation==

Despite its size, Hygiea appears very dim when observed from Earth. This is due to its dark surface and its position in the outer main belt. For this reason, six smaller asteroids were observed before Annibale de Gasparis discovered Hygiea on 12 April 1849. At most oppositions, Hygiea has a magnitude that is four magnitudes dimmer than Vesta&#x27;s, and observing it typically requires at least a telescope. However, while at a perihelic opposition, it can be observed just with 10×50 binoculars as Hygiea would have a magnitude of +9.1.

Although it is the largest body in its region, due to its dark surface and farther-than-average distance from the Sun, Hygiea appears very dim when observed from Earth. In fact, it is the third dimmest of the first twenty-three asteroids discovered, with only 13 Egeria and 17 Thetis having lower mean opposition magnitudes. At most oppositions, Hygiea has a magnitude of around +10.2, which is as much as four orders fainter than Vesta, and observation calls for at least a telescope to resolve. However, at a perihelic opposition, Hygiea can reach +9.1 magnitude and may just be resolvable with 10 × 50 binoculars, unlike the next two largest asteroids in the asteroid belt, 704 Interamnia and 511 Davida, which are always beyond binocular visibility.

A total of 17 stellar occultations by Hygiea have been tracked by Earth-based astronomers, including two (in 2002 and 2014) that were seen by a large number of observers. The observations have been used to constrain Hygiea&#x27;s size, shape and rotation axis. The Hubble Space Telescope has resolved the asteroid and ruled out the presence of any orbiting companions larger than about in diameter.

==Discovery and name==
On 12 April 1849, in Naples, Italy, astronomer Annibale de Gasparis (age 29) discovered Hygiea. It was the first of his nine asteroid discoveries. The director of the Naples observatory, Ernesto Capocci, named the asteroid. He chose to call it &quot;Igea Borbonica&quot; (&quot;Bourbon Hygieia&quot;), after the Greek goddess of health, daughter of Asclepius, and in honor of the ruling family of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies where Naples was located.

In 1852, John Russell Hind wrote that &quot;it is universally termed &quot;Hygiea&quot;, the unnecessary appendage &#x27;Borbonica&#x27; being dropped.&quot; The English form is an irregular spelling of Greek &quot;Hygieia&quot; or &quot;Hygeia&quot; (Latin &quot;Hygea&quot; or &quot;Hygia&quot;).

===Symbol===
The intended astronomical symbol for Hygiea was a zeta-shaped serpent crowned with a star, in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1F779 🝹 the serpent and serpent drinking from a bowl are traditional symbols of the goddess Hygieia (cf. U+1F54F 🕏). In later years it was substituted with a rod of Asclepius: (a serpent twined around a staff, U+2695 ⚕), confusing Hygieia with her masculine counterpart. These symbols are now both largely obsolete. In this century, 10 Hygiea has seen some minor astrological use, and its symbol was confused once again, with Asclepsius&#x27;s rod replaced by Mercury&#x27;s caduceus: , though in a more elaborate form (U+2BDA ⯚) than the caduceus symbol of the planet Mercury. The caduceus has long been mistaken for the rod of Asclepius.

==Physical characteristics==


Observations taken with the Very Large Telescope&#x27;s SPHERE imager in 2017 and 2018 revealed that Hygiea is nearly spherical and is close to a hydrostatic equilibrium shape and thus is a possible dwarf planet. Based on spectral evidence, Hygiea&#x27;s surface is thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials similar to those found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition indicates that Hygiea had not melted during the early period of Solar System formation. However, observations suggest Hygiea suffered a major collision early in its history that completely disrupted it, with its present spherical shape due to re-accretion of the disrupted material. No deep basins are visible in VLT images, indicating that any large craters that formed after re-accretion must have flat floors, consistent with an icy C-type composition.

In images taken with the VLT in 2017, a bright surface feature is visible, as well as at least two dark craters, which have been informally named Serpens and Calix after the Latin words for &#x27;snake&#x27; and &#x27;cup&#x27;, respectively. Serpens has a diameter of 180 km, Calix of 90 km.

Hygiea is the largest of the class of dark C-type asteroids that are dominant in the outer asteroid belt, beyond the Kirkwood gap at 2.82 AU. Its mean diameter . Hygiea is close to spherical, with an axis ratio of that is consistent with a MacLaurin ellipsoid. Aside from being the smallest of the &quot;big four&quot;, Hygiea has a relatively low density of , comparable to Ceres (2.16) and the larger icy satellites of the Solar System (Ganymede 1.94, Callisto 1.83, Titan 1.88, Triton 2.06) rather than to Pallas () or Vesta (3.45).

==Orbit and rotation==

Orbiting at an average of 3.14 AU from the Sun, Hygiea is the most distant of the &quot;big four&quot; asteroids. It lies closer to the ecliptic as well, with an orbital inclination of 4°. Its orbit is less circular than those of Ceres or Vesta, with an eccentricity of around 0.12. Its perihelion is at a quite similar longitude to those of Vesta and Ceres, though its ascending and descending nodes are opposite to the corresponding ones for those objects. Although its perihelion is extremely close to the mean distance of Ceres and Pallas, a collision between Hygiea and its larger companions is impossible because at that distance they are always on opposite sides of the ecliptic. In 2056, Hygiea will pass 0.025 AU from Ceres, and then in 2063, Hygiea will pass 0.020 AU from Pallas. At aphelion Hygiea reaches out to the extreme edge of the asteroid belt at the perihelia of the Hilda family, which is in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter.

As one of the most massive asteroids, Hygiea is used by the Minor Planet Center to calculate perturbations.

Hygiea is in an unstable three-body mean motion resonance with Jupiter and Saturn. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 30,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations by the planets. It is the lowest numbered asteroid in such a resonance (the next lowest numbered being 70 Panopaea).

Hygiea has a rotation period of 13.83 hours. Its single-peaked light curve has an amplitude of 0.27 mag, which is largely attributed to albedo variations. Hygiea&#x27;s north pole points towards ecliptic longitude and ecliptic latitude , which gives an axial tilt of 119° with respect to the ecliptic.

==Hygiea family==
Hygiea is the main member of the Hygiean asteroid family that constitutes about 1% of asteroids in the main belt. The family was formed when an object with a diameter of about 100 km collided with proto-Hygiea about 2 billion years ago. Because the impact craters on Hygiea today are too small to contain the volume of ejected material, it is thought that Hygiea was completely disrupted by the impact and that the majority of the debris recoalesced after the pieces that formed the rest of the family had escaped. Hygiea contains almost all the mass (over 98%) of the family.

<doc id="725598" wikidata="Q1115862" url="?curid=725598" title="Bigger than the Devil">
<text>Bigger than the Devil is the second album by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death (S.O.D.). The album was released in May 1999 on the Nuclear Blast label. Its cover design is based on Iron Maiden&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; and its title is a play on words on The Beatles member John Lennon proclaiming The Beatles were &quot;bigger (more popular) than Jesus Christ&quot;.

Subsequent releases have included both the entire &quot;Seasoning the Obese&quot; EP—incorporating both tracks &quot;Seasoning the Obese&quot; and &quot;Raise Your Sword&quot;—as well as the &quot;Ballad of the Scorpions&quot; (originally released simply as &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; on 2000s &quot;A Tribute to the Scorpions&quot;), bringing the total number of tracks to 28.

&quot;Seasoning the Obese&quot; is a reference to the Slayer song/album &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;, whereas &quot;Celtic Frosted Flakes&quot; is a reference to the Swiss extreme metal band Celtic Frost and &quot;L.A.T.K.C.H&quot; stands for &quot;Limp Against the Korn Chamber Head&quot;, a reference to various nu metal and alternative metal bands such as Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Coal Chamber and Machine Head.

&quot;Ballad of Michael H.&quot; references Michael Hutchence and interpolates INXS&#x27; &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;.

Anthrax&#x27;s song &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; on the album &quot;Among the Living&quot; used the guitar riff from the intro and outro of &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Hungry?&quot; Subsequently the thrash band M.O.D. used a different riff on their recording of the S.O.D. song.

<text>11 Parthenope ( ) is a large, bright main-belt asteroid.

Parthenope was discovered by Annibale de Gasparis on 11 May 1850, the second of his nine asteroid discoveries. It was named after &quot;Parthenopē&quot;, one of the Sirens in Greek mythology, said to have founded the city of Naples. De Gasparis &quot;used his utmost endeavours to realise a &#x27;Parthenope&#x27; in the heavens, such being the name suggested by Sir John Herschel on the occasion of the discovery of &quot;Hygiea&quot; in 1849&quot;. Two symbols were proposed for Parthenope: a fish and a star (in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC4 𜻄 ) while such symbols were still in use, and later a lyre (in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1F77A 🝺 ) in lists of symbols. Both are obsolete.

There have been two observed Parthenopian occultations, on 13 February 1987, and 28 April 2006.

On 6 August 2008, during a perihelic opposition, Parthenope had an apparent magnitude of 8.8.

In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty.

Based upon a light curve that was generated from photometric observations of this asteroid at Pulkovo Observatory, it has a rotation period of 13.722 ± 0.001 hours and varies in brightness by 0.10 ± 0.0s in magnitude. The light curve displays three maxima and minima per cycle. The JPL Small-Body Database lists a rotation period of 13.7204 hours.

==Mass==
In 2007, Baer and Chesley calculated a higher mass and density for Parthenope based on perturbations by the 90 km asteroid 17 Thetis. Baer and Chesley calculated a mass of 6.3 kg with a density of 3.3 g/cm3. 2008 estimates by Baer suggest a mass of 6.15 kg. The 1997 and 2001 estimates by Viateau and Rapaport were closer to 5 kg with a density of 2.7 g/cm3.

<text>William Henry Harrison Beadle (January 1, 1838 – November 15, 1915) was an American soldier, lawyer, educator and administrator.
==Biography==
He was born in a log cabin in Parke County, Indiana, and grew up on the frontier. Refusing his father&#x27;s offer of a farm, he accepted instead $1,000 for an education. He studied civil engineering at the University of Michigan. Shortly after graduating in 1861, he enlisted in the Union Army and by the end of the war had risen to the rank of brevet brigadier general. He received his law degree from the University of Michigan in 1867 and practiced briefly.

In 1869 President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him surveyor-general of Dakota Territory. His journeys through the territory and his previous frontier experience convinced him that school lands were a trust for future generations and should be sold at their appraised value and never for less than $10 an acre ($2,500 per km2) . This effort dominated his life. He served as secretary of the 1877 commission to codify the territorial laws and as chairman of the judiciary committee in the territorial House. In 1879 he became superintendent of public instruction. Beadle drafted the school lands provision at the South Dakota constitutional convention of 1885. When Congress accepted the state constitution in 1889, it was so impressed that similar provisions were required for North Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming. This preserved 22 million acres (89,000 km2) for schools.

Beadle served as president of the Madison State Normal School from 1889 to 1906, and as a professor of history until his retirement in 1912. He died on November 15, 1915, in San Francisco while visiting his daughter.

In 1938, the state of South Dakota donated a bronze statue of Beadle to the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. Replicas of this statue stand in the South Dakota State Capitol and at Dakota State University. Beadle County, South Dakota is named in his honor.

In 2013, Dakota State University named the General Beadle Honors Program after Beadle.

<text>The Tioughnioga River () is a tributary of the Chenango River in central New York in the United States. It drains a dissected plateau area east of the Finger Lakes at the northernmost edge of the watershed of the Susquehanna River.

The name comes from a native word for &quot;forks of the river&quot; or &quot;meeting of waters&quot;. The river was also called &quot;Tiohujodha&quot; by the Moravian Indians. At one time it was called the Onondaga, as leading to that town, and Teyoghagoga was another early form.

It rises in two branches in upstate New York southeast of the city of Syracuse, with the East Branch sometimes regarded as the main branch. The West Branch, long, issues from Tully Lake, approximately south of Tully on the Onondaga-Cortland county line, and flows south.

The Tully Valley is a preglacial valley of a northward flowing river that flowed into the Ontarian River (preglacial Lake Ontario). Near Tully, during the glacial retreat, the valley was dammed by ice to form a lake. For a period of time the retreating of the front by melting matched the forward movement of the glacier, so that the captured rock, gravel and sand was deposited into the lake. This huge quantity of material approximately half filled the valley, and reversed the flow direction to the southward. It left enormous quantities of gravel from Tully to Cortland, some of which was used as building material for Interstate 81. The gravel also forms a major aquifer for the area. Tully Lake is a glacial kettle, being formed by a large chunk of ice that was buried in the glacial debris. As the ice melted the land collapsed, causing a lake to form.

The East (main) Branch, long, rises in northeastern Cortland County at the confluence of Tioughnioga Creek and the West Branch Tioughnioga Creek. The East Branch flows southwest, receiving the West Branch at Cortland.

The Tioughnioga River then flows south-southeast, receiving the Otselic River from the northeast at Whitney Point. It joins the Chenango from the northwest at Chenango Forks, approximately northeast of Binghamton.

<text>12 Victoria is a large main-belt asteroid, orbiting the Sun with a period of 3.56 years and an eccentricity of 0.221. It is a stony (S-type) asteroid, about 112–124 km across with an albedo of 0.18 and a rotation period of 8.66 hours. Victoria has been observed to occult a star three times since its discovery. Radar and speckle interferometry observations show that the shape of Victoria is elongated, and it is suspected to be a binary asteroid, with a moon of irregular shape.

This minor planet was discovered by English astronomer J. R. Hind on September 13, 1850. Victoria is officially named after the Roman goddess of victory, but the name also honours Queen Victoria. The goddess Victoria (Nike for the Greeks) was the daughter of Styx by the Titan Pallas. The coincidence with the name of the then-reigning queen caused quite a controversy at the time, and B. A. Gould, editor of the prestigious &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot;, adopted the alternate name Clio (now used by 84 Klio), proposed by the discoverer. However, W. C. Bond, of the Harvard College Observatory, then the highest authority on astronomy in America, held that the mythological condition was fulfilled and the name therefore acceptable, and his opinion eventually prevailed.

The historical symbol for Victoria was a star with a branch of laurel. It is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC5 𜻅 ().

<text>13 Egeria is a large main-belt G-type asteroid. It was discovered by Annibale de Gasparis on November 2, 1850. Egeria was named by Urbain Le Verrier, whose computations led to the discovery of Neptune, after the mythological nymph Egeria of Aricia, Italy, the wife of Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome.

The historical symbol for Egeria was a buckler. It is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC6 𜻆 ().
Egeria occulted a star on January 8, 1992. Its disc was determined to be quite circular (217×196 km). On January 22, 2008, it occulted another star, and this occultation was timed by several observers in New Mexico and Arizona, coordinated by the IOTA Asteroid Occultation Program. The result showed that Egeria presented an approximately circular profile to Earth of 214.8×192 km, well in agreement with the 1992 occultation. It has also been studied by radar.

In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty. Spectral analysis of Egeria shows it to be unusually high in water content, 10.5–11.5% water by mass. This makes Egeria a prominent candidate for future water-mining ventures.

<text>Michel Drach (18 October 1930 in Paris – 14 February 1990 in Paris) was a French film director, writer, producer and actor.

==Life and career==
Drach was born in Paris, France, the son of Yvonne (Vanderheym) and Maurice Drach. His family was Jewish. After studying painting at the Académie des Beaux-Arts, he became involved in cinema as an assistant to his cousin Jean-Pierre Melville.

He directed three short films under his production company Port Royal Films, including the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Soliloquies&quot; (1951) and &quot;Auditorium&quot; (1957), then made his feature film debut with &quot;On n&#x27;enterre pas le dimanche&quot; (1959), a study on the existential solitude of a black person in Paris, which coincided with the French New Wave and earned him the Louis Delluc Prize.

He married Marie-José Nat who starred in his 1961 film &quot;Amelie or The Time to Love&quot;, a film which further displayed his humanism.

He returned to auteur cinema with &quot;Elise, or Real Life&quot; in 1970, which tells the story of a Frenchwoman, his wife Nat, in love with an Algerian at the time of the Algerian War. &quot;Violins at the Ball&quot; which evoked his Jewish childhood during the Occupation of France also starred his wife who received a Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress.

&quot;Le Pull-over Rouge&quot; (1979) was a chronicle of what he presents as a miscarriage of justice. &quot;Tell Me About Love&quot; (1975), &quot;Le Passé simple&quot;, and &quot;Guy de Maupassant&quot; (1982), confirmed his appeal for psychological intrigue. The latter was an expensive flop.

In 1986, with &quot;Sauve-toi, Lola&quot;, he tackled the theme of cancer, then the relationship between grandfather and grandson in &quot;Il est Génial Papy!&quot; (1987).

He had three children with Nat - David, Julien and Aurélien.

<doc id="725638" wikidata="Q17092689" url="?curid=725638" title="Religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)">
<text>A variety of religious emblems programs are used by the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) to encourage youth to learn about their faith and to recognize adults who provide significant service to youth in a religious environment. These religious programs are created, administered and awarded by the various religious groups, not the BSA, but each program must be recognized by the BSA.

==Award==
The award given by the religious organization consists of a unique medal for each program— usually only worn on formal occasions. The award is also recognized by the wear of an embroidered square knot emblem— silver on purple for youth and purple on silver for adults. The knot emblem is universal in that it does not represent any specific religion or religious award program. Each medal is designed and produced by the religious institution, while the knot emblems are produced by the BSA. Many Protestant churches use The PRAY Program, formerly God and Country, series consisting of God and Me, God and Family, God and Church, and God and Life; although they use the same program, the medals are unique in design according to each denomination.

The youth religious knot may be further identified as to level by the wear of a miniature pin-on device. The first-level program is identified by the Cub Scout device and the second by the Webelos device. The third-level uses the Boy Scout device. The fourth-level program for Venturers, senior Boy Scouts and senior Varsity Scouts is recognized by the use of the Venturer device, regardless of the program division of the youth.

==Origins==
The BSA version of the Scout Law states in part: &quot;A Scout is reverent. He is reverent toward God. He is faithful in his religious duties and respects the convictions of others in matters of custom and religion.&quot; The BSA &quot;Declaration of Religious Principle&quot; states that &quot;no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation of God and, therefore, recognizes the religious element in the training of the member, but it is absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward that religious training. Its policy is that the home and organization or group with which the member is connected shall give definite attention to religious life.&quot;

The first religious recognition program for Scouts began in 1926 when the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles began the Ad Altare Dei for altar boys who were Boy Scouts. The program was expanded nationally in 1939 and the BSA approved the medal for uniform wear.

The first Protestant religious emblem program was established in 1943 by the Lutheran church as Pro Deo Et Patria. The Jewish Ner Tamid program began in 1944 and the God and Country program used by several Protestant denominations followed in 1945. The 1948 handbook was the first to include the religious emblem programs and it described Roman Catholic, Jewish, Mormon (LDS), Buddhist, Lutheran and the general Protestant program. As of 2007 there are over 35 religious groups represented by over 75 recognized emblems. The knot for the youth emblems was introduced in 1971 and for the adult emblems in 1973.

==Program approval==
Prior to 1993, the BSA simply reviewed the programs developed by each faith. After requests for new awards in 1993, the BSA established a policy statement outlining requirements for recognition. To gain recognition, a proposed program must be approved by the BSA Religious Relationships Committee. The medal or badge design must also be approved and must be different from the emblems of other programs.

===Programs of Religious Activities with Youth===
Programs of Religious Activities with Youth, more commonly known as P.R.A.Y., is a not-for-profit organization that administers a series of religious recognitions programs that may be used by agencies such as the BSA, Girl Scouts of the USA, Camp Fire, American Heritage Girls, and other youth groups.

P.R.A.Y. consists of a national board and a business office. The national board of directors is a Christian organization with representatives from churches and national youth agencies. The board develops the curriculum and establishes guidelines for the P.R.A.Y. Program—formerly the God and Country program—used by many Protestant churches. The P.R.A.Y. business office processes orders for the medals and reference materials used in The PRAY Program and the programs of other religious organizations.

Other religious organizations have requested that the P.R.A.Y. business office administer their awards since they handle religious recognitions orders on a full-time basis. The requests are taken to the board of directors for consideration on a case-by-case basis. The religious organizations which contract with the P.R.A.Y. business office retain all responsibility for curriculum development and establishing program guidelines, and the P.R.A.Y. business office processes their orders. Thus, P.R.A.Y. has become an interfaith resource.

Each agency determines which P.R.A.Y.-administered programs meet their standards before giving their recognition. All of the BSA recognized programs are listed through P.R.A.Y., regardless of whether they are administered by P.R.A.Y.

===Other youth agencies===
Members of the Boy Scouts of America who earned a religious emblem through another youth agency such as the Girl Scouts of the USA, Camp Fire USA or a Sunday school group may wear the emblem on their BSA uniform. They may also wear the square knot insignia without a device.

===Smaller programs===
The Covenant of the Goddess is one of the oldest and largest cross-traditional groups among Wiccans and neopagans. In the early 1990s, they created the Over the Moon and the Hart and Crescent programs for youth and the Distinguished Youth Service Award for adults. The Covenant of the Goddess approached the BSA for recognition of these programs. The BSA declined and later adopted the policy requiring that a religious group must first charter at least 25 BSA units before its religious awards program may be recognized. P.R.A.Y. currently does not list any of the Covenant of the Goddess religious programs. The policy requiring a religious group to charter at least 25 BSA units before its religious awards can be recognized is no longer in place.

==Approved programs and awards==
The following awards are recognized by the BSA and the religious emblems knot may be worn upon completion of the program.

While optional, the programs may be used to fulfill certain requirements of the Cub Scout Bear and Webelos ranks, the Venturing Religious Life Bronze Award and the Venturing TRUST Award. Instruction for these programs is provided by the religious organization; unit leaders are involved only if they are also part of the religious organization. Many of the religious programs involve the youth&#x27;s parents.

Many of the religious organizations also have awards for adult BSA members; however, these awards are almost always recognition for service to the religion within Scouting. The adults are nominated for the award; they do not go through a program.

==Other awards==
P.R.A.Y. has developed several other awards that are not specifically recognized by the BSA. Mentors may be recognized by a pin or pendant that may be worn on non-Scouting apparel. There is also a four-star recognition pin for youth who have earned all four levels of their program. Other groups may have similar awards for individuals and units that are not listed through P.R.A.Y. If approved by the local council, they may be worn as temporary insignia on the right pocket of the Scout uniform.

P.R.A.Y. also offers its own &quot;Duty to God&quot; segment patch program for Scouts of all ages and adult advisers of all faiths, designed to promote their religious awards programs. To earn the patch, girls and adults must attend or make an interfaith presentation about religious awards, then fulfill a personal commitment of their choice that fulfills their &quot;duty to God&quot; as promised in the Boy Scout Oath, such as promoting, earning, or helping another girl earn the religious award for her faith. There are four segments for the patch. One is offered yearly, called the &quot;anchor patch&quot;, while the other three are offered yearly on a rotational basis. After one patch is released, the previous year&#x27;s patch is discontinued for the next three years, then is reinstated again for a one-year period. As of August 2008, only two of these three patches have been released.

== National Association of Presbyterian Scouters ==

The Celtic Cross award is given to adults active as a youth leader associated with a Presbyterian Church program, including Boy Scouts of America youth leaders and any other group or organization that chooses to give the award. To receive the award an adult must demonstrate &quot;exceptional Christian character&quot;, or has given faithful service to a youth program(s) of a by serving in church leadership positions.

==Unitarian Universalist==

===Unitarian Universalist Association===

The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA)—the religious association of most Unitarian Universalist congregations in the United States—has two religious emblems programs that are recognized by the BSA.

====History====
In 1992 the UUA Board of Trustees approved a resolution opposing the BSA&#x27;s policies on homosexuals, atheists and agnostics; and in 1993, the UUA updated Religion in Life to include criticism of these BSA policies.

In 1998, the BSA withdrew recognition of Religion in Life, stating that such information was incompatible with BSA programs. They also removed recognition of Love and Help, the program for Cub Scouts though it contained no mention of the policies. The UUA removed the material from their curriculum and the BSA renewed their recognition of the programs. When the BSA found that the UUA was issuing supplemental material with the Religion in Life workbooks that included statements critical of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or personal religious viewpoint, the BSA again withdrew recognition.

===Unitarian Universalist Scouters Organization===
The Unitarian Universalist Scouters Organization (UUSO) is an association of UU Scouts who offer religious emblem programs that are recognized by the BSA but not by the UUA.

====History====
The UUSO created the Living Your Religion program in May 2005 as a parallel award for Boy Scouts of the Unitarian faith. It was announced by P.R.A.Y. in the first quarter of 2005 that the BSA had accepted the Living your Religion award, but this was later redacted. The program was promoted at the 2005 National Scout Jamboree and shown as having BSA approval in the UUSO membership brochure and the Living Your Religion Guidebook. The UUA had stated that the UUSO is not recognized as an affiliate organization. The UUSO released the Religion and Family program for Webelos Scouts in February 2008.

=== Unitarian Universalist Association ===
The Unitarian Universalist Association signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Boy Scouts of America in March 2016 that reestablished the relationship, approving religious award programs for Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts as well as establishing a foundation for Unitarian Universalist congregations to charter Scout units. The Cub Scout religious award is called &quot;Love and Help&quot;. The Boy Scout religious award is called &quot;Religion in Life&quot;.

<doc id="725639" wikidata="Q107534" url="?curid=725639" title="14 Irene">
<text>14 Irene () is a large main-belt asteroid, discovered by the English astronomer John Russell Hind on May 19, 1851. It is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with a period of and an eccentricity of 0.168. The orbital plane is tilted at an angle of 9.1° to the plane of the ecliptic.

14 Irene was named after &quot;Irēnē&quot;, a personification of peace in Greek mythology. She was one of the Horae, daughter of Zeus and Themis. The name was suggested by Sir John Herschel. Hind wrote,
:&quot;You will readily discover that this name [...] has some relation to this event (the Great Industrial Exhibition) which is now filling our metropolis [London] with the talent of all civilised nations, with those of Peace, the productions of Art and Science, in which all mankind must feel an interest.&quot;
The &quot;Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations&quot; in the Crystal Palace of Hyde Park, London, ran from May 1 until October 18, 1851.

Hind suggested that the symbol for the asteroid should be &quot;A dove carrying an olive-branch, with a star on its head&quot;, but it was hardly drawn before the use of graphical symbols to represent asteroids was dropped entirely. It is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC7 𜻇 ().

Observations from 2007 indicate that the rotation pole of 14 Irene lies close to the plane of the ecliptic, indicating it has an obliquity close to 90°. The fairly flat Irenian lightcurves indicate somewhat spherical proportions. This is a stony S-type asteroid with a mean diameter of around 152 km. It is spinning with a rotation period of 15 hours.

There have been seven reported stellar occultation events by Irene. The best is a three chord event observed in 2013.

<doc id="725642" wikidata="Q5610349" url="?curid=725642" title="Groovie Ghoulies">
<text>The Groovie Ghoulies were an American pop punk band from Sacramento, California, United States, whose music took inspiration from horror movies. They released numerous albums, EPs, and singles, and toured internationally. The band&#x27;s name was taken from the 1970s animated television series &quot;Groovie Goolies&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;.

==History==
Though the group&#x27;s lineup fluctuated significantly throughout their career, bassist/vocalist Jeff Alexander better known under the punk name Kepi Ghoulie remained a constant fixture. Guitarist Rochelle &quot;Roach&quot; Sparman was also a longtime member. Alexander and Sparman were married but eventually divorced, which lead to difficulties in keeping the band together and its eventual breakup. The Groovie Ghoulies&#x27; music is best classified as pop-punk and is heavily influenced by early punk groups such as the Ramones, the Misfits, and The Dickies, 1960s garage rock and bubblegum artists such as The Troggs and The Monkees, and 1950s rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. Throughout their career the Groovie Ghoulies recorded cover versions of songs by several of these artists as well as other influences including KISS, Daniel Johnston and Neil Diamond.

The Groovie Ghoulies announced their breakup on May 9, 2007, just days prior to the release of their ninth studio album &quot;99 Lives&quot;.

In 2008, two tribute albums were released. &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Ghoulie&quot; from US-based Knowhere Records and &quot;When The Kids Go Go Go Crazy&quot; on German label Kamikaze Records each featured artists from Europe and North America.

Lead singer Kepi has recorded cover versions of Groovie Ghoulies songs on various releases since the band&#x27;s breakup. &quot;Fun In The Dark&quot; with The Accelerators was released in 2015; &quot;Re-Animation Festival&quot;, with The Copyrights, was released in 2019.

In September of 2022, Kepi announced that the entire Groovie Ghoulies back catalogue would be released via Pirates Press.

<doc id="725656" wikidata="Q107528" url="?curid=725656" title="15 Eunomia">
<text>15 Eunomia is a very large asteroid in the middle asteroid belt. It is the largest of the stony (S-type) asteroids, with 3 Juno as a close second. It is quite a massive asteroid, in 6th to 8th place (to within measurement uncertainties). It is the largest Eunomian asteroid, and is estimated to contain 1% of the mass of the asteroid belt.

Eunomia was discovered by Annibale de Gasparis on July 29, 1851, and named after Eunomia, one of the Horae (Hours), a personification of order and law in Greek mythology. Its historical symbol is a heart with a star on top; it is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CEC8 𜻈 ().

==Characteristics==
As the largest S-type asteroid (with 3 Juno being a very close second), Eunomia has attracted a moderate amount of scientific attention.

Eunomia appears to be an elongated but fairly regularly shaped body, with what appear to be four sides of differing curvature and noticeably different average compositions. Its elongation led to the suggestion that Eunomia may be a binary object, but this has been refuted. It is a retrograde rotator with its pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (−65°, 2°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of about 165°.

Like other true members of the family, its surface is composed of silicates and some nickel-iron, and is quite bright. Calcium-rich pyroxenes and olivine, along with nickel-iron metal, have been detected on Eunomia&#x27;s surface. Spectroscopic studies suggest that Eunomia has regions with differing compositions: A larger region dominated by olivine, which is pyroxene-poor and metal-rich, and another somewhat smaller region on one hemisphere (the less pointed end) that is noticeably richer in pyroxene, and has a generally basaltic composition.

This composition indicates that the parent body was likely subject to magmatic processes, and became at least partially differentiated under the influence of internal heating in the early period of the Solar System. The range of compositions of the remaining Eunomian asteroids, formed by a collision of the common parent body, is large enough to encompass all the surface variations on Eunomia itself. The majority of smaller Eunomian asteroids are more pyroxene rich than Eunomia&#x27;s surface, and contain very few metallic (M-type) bodies.

Altogether, these lines of evidence suggest that Eunomia is the central remnant of the parent body of the Eunomia family, which was stripped of most of its crustal material by the disrupting impact, but was perhaps not disrupted itself. However, there is uncertainty over Eunomia&#x27;s internal structure and relationship to the parent body. Computer simulations of the collision are more consistent with Eunomia being a re-accumulation of most of the fragments of a completely shattered parent body, yet Eunomia&#x27;s quite high density would indicate that it is not a rubble pile after all. Whatever the case in this respect, it appears that any metallic core region, if present, has not been exposed.

An older explanation of the compositional differences, that Eunomia is a mantle fragment of a far larger parent body (with a bit of crust on one end, and a bit of core on the other), appears to be ruled out by studies of the mass distribution of the entire Eunomia family. These indicate that the largest fragment (that is, Eunomia) has about 70% of the mass of the parent body, which is consistent with Eunomia being a &quot;central&quot; remnant, with the crust and part of the mantle stripped off.

These indications are also in accord with recent mass determinations which indicate that Eunomia&#x27;s density is typical of mostly intact stony asteroids, and not the anomalously low &quot;rubble pile&quot; density of ~ that had been reported earlier.

==Studies==

15 Eunomia was in study of asteroids using the Hubble FGS. Asteroids studied include (63) Ausonia, (15) Eunomia, (43) Ariadne, (44) Nysa, and (624) Hektor.

==Orbit==
The orbit of 15 Eunomia places it in a 7:16 mean-motion resonance with the planet Mars. Eunomia is used by the Minor Planet Center to calculate perturbations. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 25,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets.

Eunomia has been observed occulting stars three times. It has a mean opposition magnitude of +8.5, about equal to the mean brightness of Titan, and can reach +7.9 at a near perihelion opposition.

Asteroid passed about from Eunomia on March 4, 2002.

==Trivia==

The asteroid&#x27;s shape served as the inspiration to alien species&#x27; craft&#x27;s shape in the movie Arrival

<text>Belgaum (Kannada ISO: &quot;Bēḷagāma&quot;, ), officially known as Belagavi (also Belgaon), is a city in the Indian state of Karnataka located near its northern western border in the Western Ghats. It is the administrative headquarters of the eponymous Belagavi division and Belagavi district. The Government of Karnataka has proposed making Belgaum the second capital of Karnataka alongside Bangalore, hence a second state administrative building Suvarna Vidhana Soudha was inaugurated on 11 October 2012.

Belgaum has been selected in first phase out of 20 cities, as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under India&#x27;s flagship Smart Cities Mission.

==History==

Belgaum was founded in late 12th century AD by the Ratta dynasty, who shifted from nearby Saundatti. A Ratta official named Bichiraja built Kamal Basadi, a Jain temple, dedicated to Neminatha in 1204, which came to be called Kamalabasti. Pillars found inside Belgaum fort have Kannada inscriptions in Nagari scripts, one from 1199 by Ratta King Kartaveerya IV. The city&#x27;s original name was Venugram, a Sanskrit word which means &quot;village of bamboo&quot;. Alternatively, it is referred to as Venugram in early Indian texts, which means &quot;city of bamboo&quot;.

Belgaum became a part of the Yadava dynasty kingdom (Seuna) in early 13th century. An inscription from 1261 of King Krishna belonging to the Yadava dynasty attests to this. The region was invaded by Khalji dynasty of Delhi Sultanate in 14th century. Shortly thereafter, the Vijayanagara Empire was founded, and Belgaum came under the rule of Vijayanagara. In 1474, the Bahmani Sultanate conquered Belgaum with an army led by Mahmud Gawan.

The Belgaum fort was strengthened by the Adil Shah dynasty Sultans and they built the Safa Mosque. A Persian inscription states that the mosque was built by Asad Khan, a Bijapur commander. In 1518, the Bahamani sultanate splintered into five small states and Belgaum became part of the Bijapur Sultanate. The Adilshahis extended their control to the port of Goa, but retreated after the arrival and wars with the Portuguese. In 1686, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb overthrew the Bijapur sultanate and Belgaum passed nominally to the Mughals, who called it &quot;Azamnagar&quot;. However, the Mughal empire control collapsed after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. The Maratha confederacy took control of the area during the rule of the Peshwas. In 1776, the region was overrun by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan after Hyder Ali&#x27;s coup in the Kingdom of Mysore. The Peshwa regained Belgaum, after Tipu Sultan was defeated by the British forces. In 1818, the British annexed Belgaum and the region in the control of the Peshwa. Kitturu Chennamma (1778–1829) was the queen of the princely state of Kittur in Karnataka and in 1824 she led an unsuccessful armed rebellion against the British in response to the Doctrine of lapse.

Belgaum was chosen as the venue of the 39th session of the Indian National Congress in December 1924 under the presidency of Mahatma Gandhi. The city served as a major military installation for the British Raj, primarily due to its proximity to Goa, which was then a Portuguese territory. Once the British left India, the Indian government continued and still continues to have armed forces installations in Belgaum. In 1961, the Indian government, under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, used military forces from Belgaum to end Portuguese rule of Goa.

When India became independent in 1947, Belgaum and its district were part of Bombay State. In 1956, the Indian states were reorganised along linguistic lines by the States Reorganisation Act and Belgaum including 10 taluks of Bombay State were transferred to Mysore State, which was renamed Karnataka in 1973.

In 2006, the Government of Karnataka announced that Belgaum would be made the state&#x27;s second capital, and that the city would be a permanent venue for the annual 15-day winter session of the state legislature.

== Belgaum border dispute ==
The Belgaum border dispute is a dispute involving the Indian states of Karnataka and Maharashtra. Belgaum, currently a part of Karnataka and earlier the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, is claimed by Maharashtra on linguistic grounds. In 1956, the States Reorganization Act incorporated the Belgaum district including the 10 taluks in the Mysore state, which became Karnataka in 1973. Though according to the 1881 census, 64.39% of the population of Belgaum were Kannada speakers and 26.04% spoke Marathi.

In 1948, the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, a Belgaum based regional organisation fighting for the merger, was formed. On 17 January 1956, Marathi activists against the inclusion were shot by the police forces of Mysore state. Since then, 17 January is observed as the &#x27;martyr&#x27;s day&#x27; by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti.

On 11 November 2005, Karnataka Rakshna Vedike (KRV) activists daubed Belgaum Mayor Vijay More&#x27;s face with black paint (and later surrendered to the police) in the wake of Belgaum City Corporation (BCC) passing a resolution to include the district of Belgaum into Maharashtra, a neighbouring state. Upon his return to Belgaum, Vijay More was served with several show-cause notices by the Government of Karnataka and later dissolved the council.

Following this incident, in the following year&#x27;s election, Prashanta Budavi, wife of KRV (Karnataka Rakshana Vedike) City President Shantinath Budavi was appointed as mayor of the Belgaum City Corporation. Maharashtra has asked to bring 865 disputed villages including Belgaum under centre&#x27;s rule until Supreme court&#x27;s final verdict. N.D. Patil, head of legal-committee appointed by Maharashtra government said that Karnataka is intensifying the problem. He added that Marathi people of border region are not able to live with honour and dignity under Karnataka&#x27;s rule pointing out to the &#x27;unconstitutional&#x27; dissolution of Belgaum city corporation and manhandling of Belgaum mayor by Kannada activists at Bangalore.

Even though case is pending in supreme court, in 2019, Deputy CM of Maharashtra Ajit Pawar called for the incorporation of Belgaum along with Karwar and Nipani area in Maharashtra citing it was of dream of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray, a statement reiterated by CM Uddhav Thackeray in January 2021. Thackeray went on to term the region as &#x27;Karnataka-occupied areas&#x27;. The case regarding the dispute is pending before the Supreme Court for many years.

<text>17 Thetis is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 90 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 17 April 1852, by German astronomer Robert Luther at Bilk Observatory in Düsseldorf, Germany who deferred to Friedrich Wilhelm August Argelander the naming his first asteroid discovery after Thetis from Greek mythology. Its historical symbol was a dolphin and a star; it is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CECA 𜻊 ().

== Description ==
The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.1–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,419 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic.

The spectrum of this object indicates that it is an S-type asteroid with both low and high calcium forms of pyroxene on the surface, along with less than 20% olivine. The high-calcium form of pyroxene forms 40% or more of the total pyroxene present, indicating a history of igneous rock deposits. This suggests that the asteroid underwent differentiation by melting, creating a surface of basalt rock.

The mass of Thetis has been calculated from perturbations by 4 Vesta and 11 Parthenope. In 2007, Baer and Chesley calculated Thetis to have a mass of 1.23 kg with a density of 3.21 g/cm3.

One Thetidian stellar occultation was observed from Oregon in 1999. However, the event was not timed.

This minor planet was named after Thetis, the mother of Achilles in Greek mythology.

<text>Alonzo &quot;Lonnie&quot; Johnson (February 8, 1899 – June 16, 1970) was an American blues and jazz singer, guitarist, violinist and songwriter. He was a pioneer of jazz guitar and jazz violin and is recognized as the first to play an electrically amplified violin.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Johnson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana and raised in a family of musicians. He studied violin, piano and guitar as a child and learned to play various other instruments, including the mandolin, but he concentrated on the guitar throughout his professional career. &quot;There was music all around us,&quot; he recalled, &quot;and in my family you&#x27;d better play something, even if you just banged on a tin can.&quot;

In 1917, Johnson joined a revue that toured England, returning home in 1919 to find that all of his family, except his brother James, had died in the 1918 influenza epidemic.

He and his brother settled in St. Louis in 1921, where they performed as a duo. Lonnie also worked on riverboats and in the orchestra of Charlie Creath. He was good friends with Fate Marable but never performed with him.

In 1925, Johnson married, and his wife, Mary, soon began a blues career of her own, performing as Mary Johnson and pursuing a recording career from 1929 to 1936. (She is not to be confused with the later soul and gospel singer of the same name.)

As with many other early blues artists, information on Mary Johnson is often contradictory and confusing. Various online sources give her name before marriage as Mary Smith and state that she began performing in her teens. However, the writer James Sallis gave her original name as Mary Williams and stated that her interest in writing and performing blues began when she started helping Lonnie write songs and developed from there. The two never recorded together. They had six children before their divorce in 1932.

===Success in the 1920s and 1930s===
In 1925, Johnson entered and won a blues contest at the Booker T. Washington Theatre in St. Louis, the prize being a recording contract with Okeh Records. Between 1925 and 1932 he made about 130 recordings for Okeh, many of which sold well (making him one of the most popular OKeh artists). He was called to New York to record with the leading blues singers of the day, including Victoria Spivey and the country blues singer Alger &quot;Texas&quot; Alexander. He also toured with Bessie Smith, a top attraction of the Theater Owners Booking Association.
Okeh used the images of Louis Armstrong and Johnson in ads for the &quot;Defender.&quot; In December 1927, Johnson recorded in Chicago as a guest artist with Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five, paired with the banjoist Johnny St. Cyr. He played on the sides &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rough&quot;, &quot;Savoy Blues&quot;, and &quot;Hotter Than That&quot;. The most famous of the three sides, &quot;Hotter than That,&quot; encompassed the New Orleans traditions of polymetric tension, scar, dialogue, collective improvisation, and timbral diversity. In an unusual move, Johnson was invited to sit in with many OKeh jazz groups. In 1928, he recorded &quot;Hot and Bothered&quot;, &quot;Move Over&quot;, and &quot;The Mooche&quot; with Duke Ellington for Okeh. He also recorded with a group called the Chocolate Dandies (in this case, McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers). He pioneered the guitar solo on the 1927 track &quot;6/88 Glide&quot;, and on many of his early recordings he played 12-string guitar solos in a style that influenced such future jazz guitarists as George Barnes, Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt giving the instrument new meaning as a jazz voice. He excelled in purely instrumental pieces, some of which he recorded with the white jazz guitarist Eddie Lang, with whom he teamed in 1929.
Much of Johnson&#x27;s music featured experimental improvisations that would now be categorized as jazz rather than blues. According to the blues historian Gérard Herzhaft, Johnson was &quot;undeniably the creator of the guitar solo played note by note with a pick, which has become the standard in jazz, blues, country, and rock&quot;. Johnson&#x27;s style reached both the Delta bluesmen and urban players who would adapt and develop his one-string solos into the modern electric blues style. However, the writer Elijah Wald declared that in the 1920s and 1930s Johnson was best known as a sophisticated and urbane singer rather than an instrumentalist: &quot;Of the forty ads for his records that appeared in the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; between 1926 and 1931, not one even mentioned that he played guitar.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s compositions often depicted the social conditions confronting urban African Americans (&quot;Racketeers&#x27; Blues&quot;, &quot;Hard Times Ain&#x27;t Gone Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Fine Booze and Heavy Dues&quot;). In his lyrics he captured the nuances of male-female love relationships in a way that went beyond Tin Pan Alley sentimentalism. His songs displayed an ability to understand the heartaches of others, which Johnson saw as the essence of his blues.

After touring with Bessie Smith in 1929, Johnson moved to Chicago and recorded for Okeh with the stride pianist James P. Johnson. However, with the temporary demise of the recording industry in the Great Depression, he was compelled to make a living outside music, working at one point in a steel mill in Peoria, Illinois. In 1932 he moved again, to Cleveland, Ohio, where he lived for the rest of the decade. There he performed on radio programs and intermittently played with the band backing the singer Putney Dandridge.

By the late 1930s, he was recording and performing in Chicago for Decca Records, working with Roosevelt Sykes and Blind John Davis, among others. In 1939, during a session for Bluebird Records with the pianist Joshua Altheimer, Johnson used an electric guitar for the first time. He recorded 34 tracks for Bluebird over the next five years, including the hits &quot;He&#x27;s a Jelly Roll Baker&quot; and &quot;In Love Again&quot;.

===Later career===
After World War II, Johnson made the transition to rhythm and blues, recording for King in Cincinnati and having a hit in 1948 with &quot;Tomorrow Night&quot; written by Sam Coslow and Will Grosz. The song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Race Records chart for seven weeks and reached number 19 on the pop chart with sales of three million copies. A blues ballad with piano accompaniment and background singers, the song bore little resemblance to much of Johnson&#x27;s earlier blues and jazz material. The follow-ups &quot;Pleasing You&quot;, &quot;So Tired&quot;, and &quot;Confused&quot; were also R&amp;B hits.

In 1952 Johnson toured England. Tony Donegan, a British musician who played on the same bill, paid tribute to Johnson by changing his name to Lonnie Donegan. Johnson&#x27;s performances are thought to have been received poorly by British audiences; this may have been due to organizational problems with the tour.

After returning to the United States, Johnson moved to Philadelphia. He worked in a steel foundry and as a janitor. In 1959 he was working at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Philadelphia when WHAT-FM disc jockey Chris Albertson located him and produced &quot;Blues by Lonnie Johnson&quot; for Bluesville Records. This was followed by other Prestige albums, including one (&quot;Blues &amp; Ballads&quot;) with the former Ellington boss Elmer Snowden, who had helped Albertson locate Johnson. Snowden had been the original bandleader of the Washingtonians, which Ellington took over after Snowden vacated the position and made into the famous Ellington orchestra. There followed a Chicago engagement for Johnson at the Playboy Club. This succession of events placed him back on the music scene at a fortuitous time: young audiences were embracing folk music, and many veteran performers were stepping out of obscurity. Johnson was reunited with Duke Ellington and appeared as a guest at an all-star folk concert.

In 1961, Johnson was reunited with his Okeh recording partner Victoria Spivey for another Prestige album, &quot;Idle Hours&quot;, and the two singers performed at Gerdes Folk City. In 1963 he toured Europe as part of the American Folk Blues Festival with Muddy Waters and others, and recorded an album with Otis Spann in Denmark.

In May 1965, he performed at a club in Toronto before an audience of four people. Two weeks later, his shows at a different club attracted a larger audience, and Johnson, encouraged by Toronto&#x27;s relative racial harmony, decided to move to the city. He opened his club, Home of the Blues, on Toronto&#x27;s Yorkville Avenue in 1966, but it was a business failure, and Johnson was fired by the man who became owner. Through the rest of the decade, he recorded, played clubs in Canada, and embarked on several regional tours.

In 1993, Smithsonian Folkways released &quot;The Complete Folkways Recordings,&quot; an anthology of Johnson&#x27;s music, on Folkways Records. He had been featured on several compilation blues albums from Folkways, beginning in the 1960s, but never released a solo album on the label in his lifetime.

==Injury==
In March 1969 he was hit by a car while walking on a sidewalk in Toronto. He was seriously injured, suffering a broken hip and kidney injuries. A benefit concert was held on May 4, 1969, with two dozen acts that included Ian and Sylvia Tyson, John Lee Hooker, and Hagood Hardy. He never fully recovered from his injuries and suffered what was described as a stroke. He was able to return to the stage for one performance at Massey Hall on February 23, 1970, walking with the aid of a cane, to sing a couple of songs with Buddy Guy; Johnson received a standing ovation.

==Death==
Johnson died on June 16, 1970. A funeral was held at Mount Hope Cemetery in Toronto by his friends and fellow musicians, but his family members insisted on transferring the body to Philadelphia where he was buried. He was &quot;virtually broke.&quot; The Killer Blues Headstone project, a nonprofit organization that places headstones on unmarked graves of blues musicians, purchased a headstone for Johnson around 2014.

==Influence==
Johnson&#x27;s early recordings are the first guitar recordings that display a single-note soloing style with string bending and vibrato. Johnson pioneered this style of guitar playing on records, and his influence is obvious in the playing of Django Reinhardt, T-Bone Walker and virtually all electric blues guitarists.

One of Elvis Presley&#x27;s earliest recordings was a version of Johnson&#x27;s blues ballad &quot;Tomorrow Night&quot;, written by Sam Coslow and Will Grosz. Presley&#x27;s vocal phrasing mimics Johnson&#x27;s, and many of Presley&#x27;s signature vibrato and baritone sounds can be heard in development. &quot;Tomorrow Night&quot; was also recorded by LaVern Baker and (in 1957) by Jerry Lee Lewis.

In the liner notes for the album &quot;Biograph&quot;, Bob Dylan described his encounters with Johnson in New York City. &quot;I was lucky to meet Lonnie Johnson at the same club I was working and I must say he greatly influenced me. You can hear it in that first record. I mean &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot;...that&#x27;s pretty much Lonnie Johnson. I used to watch him every chance I got and sometimes he&#x27;d let me play with him. I think he and Tampa Red and of course Scrapper Blackwell, that&#x27;s my favorite style of guitar playing.&quot; In his autobiography, &quot;Chronicles, Vol. 1&quot;, Dylan wrote about the performing method he learned from Lonnie Johnson and remarked that Robert Johnson had learned a lot from Lonnie Johnson. Some of Robert Johnson&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Malted Milk,&quot; are seen as new versions of songs recorded by Lonnie Johnson.

<doc id="725680" wikidata="Q1839756" url="?curid=725680" title="Torngat Mountains">
<text>The Torngat Mountains are a mountain range on the Labrador Peninsula at the northern tip of Newfoundland and Labrador and eastern Quebec. They are part of the Arctic Cordillera. The mountains form a peninsula that separates Ungava Bay from the Atlantic Ocean.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Torngat&quot; is derived from an Inuktitut word meaning &quot;place of spirits&quot;, sometimes interpreted as &quot;place of evil spirits&quot;.

==Geography==
The Torngat Mountains have a substantial geographical extent. About 56% of the range is located in Quebec, 44% is in Labrador, and the remainder, less than 1%, is located on Killiniq Island in Nunavut. At least 2% of the mountain chain is under water, and poorly surveyed. The Torngat Mountains cover , including lowland areas and extend over from Cape Chidley in the north to Hebron Fjord in the south. The Torngat Mountains have the highest peaks of eastern continental Canada.

The highest point is Mount Caubvick (also known as Mont D&#x27;Iberville) at . There are no trees in the Torngat Mountains because the mountains lie in an arctic tundra climate and are therefore above the tree line.

Permafrost is continuous on the Quebec side of the border, and it is extensive but discontinuous on the eastern Atlantic side. The terrain is over above sea level and is predominantly rocky desert.

== Geology ==

Precambrian gneisses that comprise the Torngat Mountains are among the oldest on Earth and have been dated at roughly 3.6 to 3.9 billion years old. Geologists recognize the gneisses of the Torngats as a part of the Canadian Shield or Laurentian Upland, which, composing the very old North American Craton, split from the continent of Rodinia roughly 750 million years ago to form the geologic core of North America.

However, the mountain-building or orogeny of the Torngats took place much more recently, and is characteristic of the folding and faulting that defines the series of geological events known as Arctic Cordillera. This, according to some, makes the Torngats, as mountains, &quot;distinct compared to the surrounding Precambrian Canadian Shield,&quot; though they are ultimately composed of shield rock. Evidence of this dramatic cordilleran folding and faulting characterizing the Torngat Mountains can be seen distinctly in rocks where the North American Craton long ago collided with the Nain Craton, later exposed in cross-section by glacial scouring, especially at Saglek Fjord.

== Glaciation ==
The ranges of the Torngat Mountains are separated by deep fjords and finger lakes surrounded by sheer rock walls. The fjords were produced by glaciation. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of the mountains at least once, however during the last ice age the coverage was more limited.

Currently, there are over 100 active small mountain glaciers in the Torngat Mountains with a total of about 195 ice masses in the region.

== Ecology ==
===Flora===
The Torngat Mountain tundra is characterized by sparse cover of arctic sedges, grass, lichen, and moss. Patches of mixed arctic evergreen and deciduous shrubs can be found on sheltered south-facing slopes, increasing in prevalence as one moves south.

===Fauna===
The tundra provides seasonal habitat for caribou, polar bears, and the only tundra-dwelling black bears in the world. In addition, the coastal area of this ecoregion lies along the Atlantic migratory flyway.

==Conservation==
The Torngat Mountains National Park Reserve was announced on 1 December 2005. It aims to protect wildlife (caribou, polar bears, peregrine falcon and golden eagle among others), while offering wilderness-oriented recreational activities.

==In popular culture==
In the CBC Series &quot;Geologic Journey&quot;, the Torngat mountains are featured. Notably, a billion-year-old coal seam (based on algae, not peat swamps) was discovered in the Torngat mountains on the Newfoundland Coast as part of the filming of the series.

&quot;Backcountry Magazine&quot; ran a feature story written by Drew Pogge in 2009 on steep skiing in the Torngat Mountains, notably first descents in Nachvak and Saglek fjords, as well as on the Caubvick massif.

<text>The 2004 European Parliament election in Ireland was the Irish component of the 2004 European Parliament election. The voting was held on Friday, 11 June 2004. The election coincided with the 2004 local elections. The election was conducted under the single transferable vote.

This was the first election that Fine Gael won more seats than Fianna Fáil, who had won most seats at every election from 1979.

==Constituency revision==
Since the 1999 European Parliament election, Ireland&#x27;s entitlement had fallen from 15 seats to 13 seats due to European Union expansion and some constituencies boundaries and names were changed. 
*Munster constituency lost County Clare and was reduced from 4 seats to 3 and renamed South
*Connacht–Ulster gained County Clare and was renamed North-West
*Leinster had no boundary changes but was reduced from 4 seats to 3 and renamed East
*Dublin was unchanged

==Results==
The election was organised by city/county council area, the basis for the local elections being held simultaneously. Voters received different-coloured ballot papers for the European election, city/county council election, and a constitutional referendum, all of which went into the same ballot box and were separated by colour once the boxes arrived at the count centre for the city/county. Not all voters received all ballots as the franchises differ. The European ballots were all counted in one city/county, necessitating a second transportation of the separated ballots from the other city/county centres. For example, the East ballots were counted in Navan, County Meath.

<doc id="725686" wikidata="Q570025" url="?curid=725686" title="Screeching Weasel">
<text>Screeching Weasel is an American punk rock band consisting of Ben Weasel (vocals), Mike Kennerty (guitar), Mike Hunchback (guitar), Zach &quot;Poutine&quot; Brandner (bass) and Pierre Marche (drums) founded in 1986 by Ben Weasel and John Jughead. Screeching Weasel is originally from the Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights, Illinois. Since their formation, Screeching Weasel have reformed several times with lineup changes. Ben Weasel has been the only constant member, though Jughead was present in every incarnation of the band until 2009. Other prominent members include guitarist/bassist Dan Vapid and drummer Dan Panic, who have each appeared on six of the band&#x27;s studio albums, and Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt who appeared on one.

Screeching Weasel has recorded 14 studio albums so far, splitting time between a number of famous independent record labels such as Lookout! Records and Fat Wreck Chords. Despite never achieving mainstream success, a number of largely popular acts cite them as influential.

== History ==
=== Early years (1986–1989) ===

The band originally called themselves &quot;All Night Garage Sale&quot; but changed their name to Screeching Weasel, a variation of a name a friend had suggested, Screaming Otter, which was a reference to a T-shirt that read, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a screaming otter in my pants!&quot;. Shortly after their formation, Weasel decided that it was too difficult to play bass and sing at the same time, so Vince Vogel, who took the stage name &quot;Vinnie Bovine&quot; joined as the band&#x27;s bassist. The band recorded their debut album, &quot;Screeching Weasel&quot;, in one night for $200 and released it on Chicago label Underdog Records in 1987.

In 1988, Bovine was fired from the band and was replaced with Warren Fischer, better known as Fish, and former member of the band Ozzfish. The band recorded their second studio album, &quot;Boogadaboogadaboogada!&quot;, which featured Weasel playing second guitar (he would later state that he only played on about a quarter of the songs) and made a name for themselves by opening a show for Operation Ivy at 924 Gilman Street. Steve Cheese was fired from the band shortly after the recording due to his unwillingness to tour outside of Chicago. He was replaced by Aaron Cometbus for two shows who then was replaced by Brian Vermin. &quot;Boogadaboogadaboogada!&quot; was released in late 1988 on Roadkill Records, a label formed by David Best.

After what Weasel described as a &quot;disastrous&quot; tour, Fish left the group and was replaced by Dan Schafer, originally nicknamed &quot;Sewercap&quot; and later renamed Danny Vapid. The new band members recorded an extended play entitled &quot;Punkhouse&quot; for Limited Potential Records soon after that. The band ended up recording four more songs in 1989 that were featured on compilations, featuring a second guitarist Doug Ward, who also joined the band for several live performances. Screeching Weasel disbanded when Vermin and Vapid stated that they wanted to leave the band to concentrate on their side project, Sludgeworth.

=== First reformation (1991–1994) ===

After the break-up, Weasel and Jughead formed a new band called The Gore Gore Girls, and Ben briefly performed in the original incarnation of The Vindictives. On December 29, 1990, the members of Screeching Weasel reunited for what was intended as a one-off gig to pay off debts the band incurred from the recordings of &quot;Boogadaboogadaboogada! and Punkhouse ep&quot;. The lineup consisted of Ben, Jughead, Vapid, Vermin, and Ward. After the show, Vapid discussed the idea of reforming Screeching Weasel with Jughead. All of the band&#x27;s members agreed to reform, with the exceptions of Brian Vermin and Douglas Ward. To replace Vermin, drummer Dan Panic (Dan Sullivan) was brought in. Before recording their third studio album, &quot;My Brain Hurts&quot; (1991) for Lookout! Records, Weasel decided that he wanted to focus on singing and would no longer be playing guitar in the band. Vapid switched instruments from bass to guitar, and former Gore Gore Girls bassist Dave Naked joined the band. The recording sessions for the album also produced the extended play &quot;Pervo Devo&quot;.

After recording &quot;My Brain Hurts&quot;, Dave Naked was fired from the band and Scott &quot;Gub&quot; Conway, Panic&#x27;s former bandmate, was brought in as the band&#x27;s bassist to tour. After the tour, Johnny Personality of The Vindictives became the band&#x27;s bassist, as Gub was committed to another band. By late 1992, the band had recorded the follow-up to &quot;My Brain Hurts&quot;, &quot;Wiggle&quot;, which also marked their first collaboration with producer Mass Giorgini, who also became the bassist of the band from 1998 to 2004. Personality then left the band to focus on The Vindictives. Instead of adding a new member, Weasel moved back to guitar, and Vapid moved back to bass. The band was then asked to record a cover of an entire Ramones album, &quot;Ramones&quot; (1992), followed later that year by &quot;Anthem for a New Tomorrow&quot;. Shortly after the record&#x27;s release, Weasel decided that he no longer wanted to perform live, and Vapid left after falling out with Ben. After the release of &quot;How to Make Enemies and Irritate People&quot; (1994), the band broke up for the second time.

=== Second reformation (1996–2001) ===

Following the second breakup, Weasel, Vapid, and Panic formed the band the Riverdales and experienced some notoriety touring with Green Day. By 1996, they rejoined with Jughead and recorded a new Screeching Weasel album &quot;Bark Like a Dog&quot; for Fat Mike&#x27;s Fat Wreck Chords label. The album peaked at number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart, making it their highest-charting album. However, both Vapid and Panic left by mutual decision after the recording, and Weasel and Jughead decided to go on without them, adding bassist Mass Giorgini and drummer Dan Lumley, both from Squirtgun. Weasel also decided for the second time that he no longer wanted to play guitar, so guitarist Zac Damon was added.

In 1998, the group&#x27;s new lineup recorded the &quot;Major Label Debut&quot; EP; the first release on Panic Button Records, a label Ben and John had formed that year and quickly followed it with &quot;Television City Dream&quot;. Their next release, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Emo&quot;, featured the same lineup minus Zac Damon, who was unable to record due to school commitments at the time. In 2000 the band brought in Phillip Hill as a second guitarist and recorded what was intended to be their final album, &quot;Teen Punks in Heat&quot;. After the album, Screeching Weasel made their first live appearances since 1993, playing 30 minute matinees at Chicago&#x27;s House of Blues. The band broke up for the third—and allegedly final—time on July 6, 2001, due to Jughead&#x27;s frustration of a lack of touring.

=== Hiatus and brief third reformation (2001–2008) ===
After the third breakup, Jughead started a new band called Even in Blackouts, while Weasel released a solo album titled &quot;Fidatevi&quot;, and new Riverdales album, &quot;Phase Three&quot;.

Both Weasel and Jughead authored books seemingly related to Screeching Weasel. In 2001, Ben Weasel published &quot;Like Hell&quot;, the account of a fictional punk band called Pagan Icons and the life of their frontman, Joe Pagan. Jughead released &quot;Weasels in a Box&quot;, his admittedly fictionalized account of Screeching Weasel&#x27;s history. Both books were published by Hope And Nonthings, a publishing house run by Jughead. Jughead also continued his membership with the Neo-Futurists, a theater group he has written and performed with since 1997, appearing in a show called Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind.

In 2004, Ben reclaimed all of the Screeching Weasel masters from Lookout! Records in the wake of long-running financial and personal conflicts. The masters were subsequently licensed to and reissued by Asian Man Records. That same year a lineup consisting of Ben Weasel, Jughead, and multi-year Screeching Weasel veterans Dan Vapid, Mass Giorgini, and Dan Lumley came together to play surprise sets at the Chicago club The Fireside Bowl. According to Ben Weasel, there was an intention to tour that year, but &quot;the offers just weren&#x27;t there&quot;.

Ben released a second solo album, &quot;These Ones Are Bitter&quot;, in 2007, and gave his first solo live performance at that year&#x27;s Insubordination Fest in Baltimore. During his set, backed up by The Guts, he was joined on stage by Dan Vapid for several Screeching Weasel and Riverdales songs. Ben Weasel and Dan Vapid also played two shows in August 2008 at Reggie&#x27;s Rock Club in Chicago, playing the entirety of My Brain Hurts as well as other songs by Screeching Weasel, The Riverdales, and from Ben Weasel&#x27;s solo albums.

=== Fourth reformation (2009–2011) ===
2009–2011

In March 2009, Ben Weasel announced on his blog that he had reformed Screeching Weasel. For the first time, the band featured a lineup without John Jughead, although longtime member Dan Vapid had rejoined. Ben wrote:

&quot;I really want to give you the lowdown on the SW re-formation but there&#x27;s honestly not a lot to say. Legal issues prevented me from doing my own band on my own terms over the past couple of years but thankfully those problems are all resolved now. The kind of stuff happens sometimes. I won&#x27;t deny that those problems – which were really just the culmination of many years of a lot of other b.s. - left a foul taste in my mouth about SW. But now that all the headaches are behind me I&#x27;m feeling great about it. I&#x27;m finally running my own band again and I&#x27;m really happy and excited to be back at it. I&#x27;ve got a killer line-up myself, Danny Vapid, Simon Lamb (the Ritalins), Justin Perkins (Yesterday&#x27;s Kids) and Adam Cargin (Blueheels) (he&#x27;s also the new Riverdales drummer) and we&#x27;ve got a great set list.&quot;
In response to the resurrection of the Screeching Weasel name without his involvement, Jughead released the following statement via his MySpace page:
If it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I actually enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. &quot;This can&#x27;t be the band I was in.&quot; I say to myself. &quot;I would have been preparing.&quot; My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn&#x27;t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn&#x27;t Screeching Weasel, because I don&#x27;t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still trying to make a living somehow, seeing that their band&#x27;s prominent &quot;leader&quot; never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.
Weasel later revealed the split with Jughead was the result of two-year-long legal battle over Screeching Weasel&#x27;s business affairs and, although they were resolved, Weasel said &quot;it was not an amicable split&quot; and that &quot;things had gone way, way past the point of no return in terms of our friendship and any semblance of a working relationship anymore&quot;.

In November 2009, Mike Park of Asian Man Records announced that Weasel had decided to sever his relationship with the label and that Recess Records would be carrying the Screeching Weasel, Riverdales and Ben Weasel solo back catalogues.

On November 30, 2010, Ben Weasel appeared on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; to talk about his personal problems with anxiety disorders and agoraphobia.

On March 15, 2011, the band released its first album in eleven years, &quot;First World Manifesto&quot; on Fat Wreck Chords. It was produced by Mike Kennerty of The All-American Rejects. It was announced that the label will also be releasing the back catalogs of Screeching Weasel, the Riverdales, and Ben Weasel.

On March 18, 2011, during Screeching Weasel&#x27;s South by Southwest Festival performance at the Scoot Inn in Austin, Texas, Foster punched a female audience member who had thrown a beer and ice cubes at him, and also spit in his face. As a result a woman on the stage, believed to be the club&#x27;s owner, grabbed him from behind, and Ben mistaking her for an attacking fan turned around and punched her in the scuffle. Foster was then restrained by security and left the venue. On March 22, Foster apologized. On March 23, Punknews.org posted a statement from the four other members of Screeching Weasel, announcing their resignation from the band.

On March 31, Weasel announced the cancellation of &quot;Weasel Fest&quot;, a 3-day event in honor of Screeching Weasel&#x27;s 25th anniversary that had been scheduled to take place at Reggie&#x27;s Rock Club in Chicago, after many of the other acts on the bill dropped out in the wake of the SXSW incident. In an interview published in July 2011, Fat Mike, owner of Fat Wreck Chords, stated that he had no interest in releasing another Screeching Weasel record, although the label might still reissue the band&#x27;s back catalog.

=== New lineup (2011-present) ===
Despite speculation of a breakup, Screeching Weasel returned with a new lineup on October 29 at Reggie&#x27;s Rock Club in Chicago with The Queers. The lineup included Ben Weasel-vocals, Zac Damon-guitar, Dave Klein-bass, Pierre Marche-drums and Mike Hunchback-rhythm guitar. A new 7-song EP, titled &quot;Carnival of Schadenfreude&quot;, was recorded in July 2011. It was also produced by Mike Kennerty and was released in November 2011 on Recess Records. In March 2013, Ben Weasel announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that Dave Klein had split from the group amicably to join Black Flag. He was replaced by bassist Zach Brandner, AKA &quot;Poutine.&quot;

On July 13, 2014, Weasel released a video on YouTube stating that new albums were in the works, through a two-part rock opera called &quot;Baby Fat&quot;. &quot;Baby Fat: Act 1&quot; was crowd-funded, released in 2015 after the band raised over $40,000. As yet, Baby Fat: Act 2 has not been announced or released. At the end of 2016, Zac Damon was replaced by guitarist, Trevor Jackson.

A documentary on the band was in the works for several years, but was cancelled in 2012, with producers citing Weasel&#x27;s lack of cooperation with production. Screeching Weasel announced in March 2017 that a new documentary was underway entitled My Right: The Screeching Weasel Story. They recorded and digitally released two singles on December 11, 2017, entitled &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; and &quot;New Years Eve&quot; and played several shows in 2018. They subsequently announced via their website that a new album was scheduled to be recorded in summer 2019 with a tour in 2020 to follow. 

On March 24, 2020, Screeching Weasel released their 13th album, &quot;Some Freaks of Atavism&quot; and on July 15, 2022, Screeching Weasel released their 14th album, &quot;The Awful Disclosures of Screeching Weasel&quot; with producer Mike Kennerty replacing Trevor Jackson as guitarist/backing vocalist. Both records were well-received by their fans and critics.

The band remains active, though tour plans were postponed for a number of years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with their last shows prior being played in 2019. In 2024, they announced plans to resume live shows in 2025 and shows scheduled in Chicago for March 2025 sold out in less than 1 hour. Ben Weasel has stated, &quot;Screeching Weasel is never breaking up again. The band dies when I do.&quot;

== Musical style and legacy ==
In addition to the Ramones, Ben Weasel credits bands such as Black Flag, D.O.A., The Dickies and Zero Boys for laying the groundwork for Screeching Weasel. Much like the Ramones, Screeching Weasel&#x27;s common lyrical themes include girls and mental health problems (Weasel suffered from anxiety). While Weasel has been the sole writer of the majority of the band&#x27;s catalogue, a number of songs credit Vapid, Jughead, or The Queers&#x27; frontman Joe King as co-writers.

Many subsequent punk and pop punk bands who have experienced mainstream success cite Screeching Weasel as an influence. Blink-182 covered the band&#x27;s song &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; on their album &quot;Buddha&quot;, with Blink-182 guitarist Tom Delonge citing them as one of the biggest influences on his songwriting. Other influenced bands include Green Day (whose bassist Mike Dirnt previously played in Screeching Weasel), The All-American Rejects (whose guitarist Mike Kennerty produced &quot;First World Manifesto&quot;, &quot;Carnival of Schadenfreude&quot;, &quot;Baby Fat -Act I&quot; and &quot;Some Freaks of Atavism&quot;), New Found Glory, Eve 6, Bowling for Soup, MxPx, fellow Chicago bands Rise Against, Fall Out Boy, Allister, and Alkaline Trio, and popular ska punk band Less Than Jake.

Additionally, a number of independent punk bands such as The Apers, Bigwig, The Leftovers, The Manges, and The Unlovables cite Screeching Weasel as influential. Screeching Weasel has been categorized as skate punk, pop punk and punk rock.

<doc id="725692" wikidata="Q7774978" url="?curid=725692" title="The Will Rogers Follies">
<text>The Will Rogers Follies is a musical with a book by Peter Stone, lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and music by Cy Coleman.

It focuses on the life and career of humorist and performer Will Rogers, using as a backdrop the Ziegfeld Follies, which he often headlined, and describes episodes in his life in the form of production numbers. The Rogers character also performs rope tricks in between scenes. The revue contains snippets of Rogers&#x27; &quot;homespun&quot; style of wisdom.

==Synopsis==
;Act I

Rogers frequently speaks directly to the audience and to Florenz Ziegfeld himself, who often interjects to question the progress of the show and to give some directorial advice. After introducing the audience to his friends and family, Rogers discusses leaving home at 19 to become a cowboy in Argentina. Ziegfeld tells Rogers that he must &quot;meet the girl&quot;. Although Rogers met Betty Blake at a train station, Ziegfeld creates a more &quot;theatrical&quot; meeting by having her lowered romantically from the Moon.

Because Betty is eager to marry Rogers, the show moves forward several years to a time when Rogers is playing in a small Wild West revue. The couple is about to be married, but Ziegfeld interrupts, saying that the wedding has to be delayed, because it must occur in the first act finale. So, as Rogers&#x27; success continues to grow, he and Betty travel around the country performing and produce four children. Rogers gets his big break when he is invited to join the Ziegfeld Follies and, by the early 1910s, he is a big vaudeville and radio star. He is about to leave for Hollywood to start a career in film, when it is at last time for the finale and the wedding.

;Act II

Rogers is at the zenith of his popularity, the country&#x27;s biggest and highest paid star of every medium of his time– stage, screen, radio, newspapers, and public appearances– and is even asked to run for president. This doesn&#x27;t leave him much time for Betty, and she begins to feel neglected and starts singing the blues. Rogers comes home with &quot;a treasury of precious jewels,&quot; and all is forgiven. The good mood doesn&#x27;t last long, however, as bill collectors and creditors come knocking at the door. Ziegfeld has lost his fortune, and the Great Depression is in full swing. Herbert Hoover asks Rogers to give a speech to the nation. Rogers also reconciles with his estranged father. The show ends with the fatal plane ride in Alaska that Rogers shares with Wiley Post, a character whose cheerful invitation, &quot;Let&#x27;s go flyin&#x27; Will!&quot; is heard throughout the show.

== Original cast and characters ==
==Productions==
After thirty-three previews, the Broadway production opened on May 1, 1991, at the Palace Theatre, and closed on September 5, 1993 after 981 performances. Directed and choreographed by Tommy Tune, the original cast included Keith Carradine as Rogers, Dee Hoty as Betty Blake, Dick Latessa as Will&#x27;s father Clem, and Cady Huffman as Ziegfeld&#x27;s favorite chorus girl. Replacements later in the run included Mac Davis and Larry Gatlin as Rogers, Mickey Rooney as Clem, and Susan Anton and Marla Maples as Ziegfeld&#x27;s favorite chorus girl. The recorded voice of Gregory Peck was heard as Ziegfeld.

The original choice of the authors to play Will Rogers was John Denver, but, due to a perceived insult from librettist Peter Stone, Denver bowed out of consideration for casting.

The show also enjoyed a number of national tours, with Carradine, Davis, and Gatlin in the first National tour in 1993 and 1994. Pat Boone starred in the musical in Branson, Missouri in 1994. The role of Betty (his wife) was played by Marylee Graffeo(Fairbanks). &quot;Variety&quot; noted that &quot;Broadway Came To Branson with the bow of the &#x27;Will Rogers Follies: A Life in Review&#x27; in the new Will Rogers Theater last Saturday...Pat Boone is a solid hit in Branson as Will Rogers in the &#x27;Follies.&#x27;&quot; The music was not live but digitalized.

<text>Holtzbrinck Publishing Group () is a privately held German company headquartered in Stuttgart, that owns publishing companies worldwide. Through Macmillan Publishers, it is one of the Big Five English-language publishing companies.

In 2015, it merged most of its Macmillan Science and Education unit (including Nature Publishing Group) with Springer Science+Business Media, creating the company Springer Nature. Holtzbrinck owns 53% of the combined company.

==History==
The history of Georg von Holtzbrink&#x27;s publishing activities during the Nazi years 1933-1945 has been controversial. After World War II, Georg von Holtzbrinck, a former member of the Nazi party, reestablished a group in 1948, beginning as a German book club. In the 1960s, it purchased the German publishing companies Droemer, Kindler, Rowohlt and S. Fischer Verlag. In 1985, it acquired the retail book division of Holt, Rinehart and Winston, naming it the Henry Holt Book Company. One year later, the company acquired &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine for $52.6 million. In 1994, it purchased a majority interest in Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux from retiring Roger W. Straus, Jr. A year later, it purchased a 70% majority interest in Macmillan Publishers, and then the remaining shares in 1999. In 2001, Pearson sold the Macmillan trademark in the United States (gained with the acquisition of Simon &amp; Schuster educational and professional division, which included the assets of former Macmillan Inc.) to Holtzbrinck.

In March 2006, Holtzbrinck forced Tor Books, which is owned by Holtzbrinck, to stop making its books available as e-books via Baen Ebooks because of concerns regarding the lack of digital rights management (DRM). The policy was later changed and Tor titles became available as DRM-free e-books in 2012. The Tor UK label in Britain (and hence the EU) does the same. The company also received a good deal of attention when it bought the then leading German social networking platform StudiVZ in January 2007.

Holtzbrinck has total annual sales of 2.1 billion euros (as of 2005); 49% of sales are in Germany and 23% in North America. It had 2005 earnings before taxes of 142 million euros, and a total of 14,000 employees.

The current chairman of the group is Stefan von Holtzbrinck. Don Weisberg is CEO of Macmillan, the company that unites the US-based businesses of the group. Previous CEOs of Macmillan include John Sargent.

<doc id="725701" wikidata="Q57542" url="?curid=725701" title="Filip Vujanović">
<text>Filip Vujanović (, ; born 1 September 1954) is a Montenegrin politician who served as the 3rd president of the Republic of Montenegro under Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 to 2006, and the 1st president of independent Montenegro from 2006 to 2018.

==Early life and career==
Born and raised in Belgrade, Vujanović graduated from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Law School. Between 1978 and 1981 he worked in one of the city&#x27;s Municipal Courts, and later also as an assistant at the Belgrade District Court. In 1981, aged 27, he moved to Titograd. Following a short stint as secretary at Titograd&#x27;s District Court, he worked as a lawyer until entering politics in March 1993.

==Career in politics==
Vujanović joined the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) in 1993 upon the invitation of Montenegrin federal President Momir Bulatović following the creation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (comprising Montenegro and Serbia) in the wake of the break-up of the previous Yugoslavia.

He was Minister of Justice in Milo Đukanović&#x27;s pro-Slobodan Milošević government (1993–1996), and then Interior Minister from 1996 to 1998 after Đukanović switched loyalty and turned against Milošević. During the 1997 DPS leadership conflict, Vujanović initially declared neutrality. He eventually sided with Milo Đukanović after Đukanović won the presidential election. Đukanović then appointed Vujanović as the first Prime Minister of Montenegro; Vujanović served in that post from 5 February 1998 until 8 January 2003.

==President of Montenegro==
On 5 November 2002, he became speaker of the Montenegrin parliament, a position which, from 25 November 2002, made him Acting President of Montenegro due to the resignation of Đukanović from the presidency to prepare to switch office with Vujanović. Vujanović ran in the December 2002 presidential elections and won a landslide victory, receiving 86% of the vote, but the election was ruled invalid because turnout was less than 50%. The elections were held again in February 2003, with Vujanović winning 81% of the vote, but again turnout was below 50%. The elections were held for a third time on 11 May 2003, with the minimum turnout rule abolished, and Vujanović won again with 63% of the vote.

Vujanović resigned from his positions as speaker and acting president on 19 May 2003 but became president of Montenegro again three days later when his term began. Even though he was born in Serbia, he was one of the most prominent Montenegrin secessionists. As president of Montenegro, Vujanović was a supporter of the Montenegro independence referendum, though Prime Minister Đukanović was much more high-profile in his campaign for it. Vujanović&#x27;s messages often focus on Montenegro&#x27;s and Serbia&#x27;s ability to have a peaceful separation and post-independence cooperation, and he is friends with former Serbian president Boris Tadić. On 21 May 2006, an independence referendum was held in Montenegro; it was approved by 55.5% of voters, narrowly passing the 55% threshold. On 3 June 2006, Montenegro became an independent state.

On 14 December 2006, he signed the Framework Document for the accession to the Partnership for Peace Programme, wherewith Montenegro became a member of the NATO program &quot;Partnership for Peace&quot;. During the press conference that President Vujanovic and Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer held after signing the Partnership for Peace Framework Document, Scheffer welcomed the way Montenegro decided to go towards the European integrations.
In April 2007, President Vujanović declared he would protect the property of the main religious institution in Montenegro, the Serbian Orthodox Church during an attempt of the non-canonical Montenegrin Orthodox Church to forcibly seize its property. At the 2008 presidential election, Vujanović ran for the second presidential term, and secured another five years in office in the first election round, with 51.89% vote. The turnout was 68.2%.

On 20 January 2012, Vujanović adopted the Decision on Calling Elections for the MPs of the local Parliament of Tivat and the local Parliament of Herceg Novi. On 28 March 2012, Vujanović, after carrying out consultations with the Bar Association of Montenegro, the Association of Judges of Montenegro, Law faculties, the Academy of Sciences, Extended Session of the Supreme Court of Montenegro, appointed four members of the Judicial Council, that were judges of the Constitutional Court of Montenegro.
On 31 July 2012, President Vujanović passed a Decision on Calling Elections for Members of the Parliament of Montenegro. The parliamentary elections were held on 14 October and were won by the Coalition for European Montenegro, dominated by DPS. Following the elections, on 4 December 2012, Vujanović destined Đukanović as Prime Minister.

In February 2013, the Constitutional Court officially approved Vujanović&#x27;s candidacy for a new term, noting that for his 2003–2008 term, he was elected as President of the Republic of Montenegro as a constituent entity within its state union with Serbia and served as de facto independent head of state only in 2006–2008, meaning that his 2008–2013 term is legally his first term. At the 2013 presidential election Vujanović won the election for a third presidential term, with 51.2% of the vote against the Democratic Front opposition alliance nominee, Miodrag Lekić.

===Foreign policy===

On 5 December 2012, Vujanović hosted the 4th Regional Summit of the Heads of States, held in Budva. On 13 June 2013, Vujanović was participating in the 18th Summit of the Heads of States of the Central European Countries, held in Bratislava.

====Serbia====
Vujanović, as President of Montenegro, recognized the Independence of Kosovo, a Serbian autonomous province. In October 2008, the Serbian government expelled Anka Vojvodić, the ambassador of Montenegro to Belgrade. Almost one year later, Serbia finally accepted Igor Jovović to take on the role of the new Montenegrin ambassador.

After being elected the new Serbian president in May 2012, Tomislav Nikolić gave an interview to Televizija Crne Gore, during which he stated that he recognizes Montenegro as a state, &quot;but not any difference between Serbs and Montenegrins, because there is none&quot;. On 13 June 2013, Vujanović met Nikolić in Bratislava, pointing out that he &quot;supported the activities of the two Governments aimed at joint projects and interests, with a special emphasis on the infrastructural projects&quot;.

====Romania====
On 24 June 2013, Vujanović received Titus Corlățean, Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, who came to Montenegro on the occasion of the Romanian bus crash. He reiterated the deepest condolences in his own name and on behalf of the citizens of Montenegro. He also sent a telegram of condolences to Romania&#x27;s President, Traian Băsescu, over that accident in which 18 tourists from Romania lost their lives. 26 June, the day when the victims were repatriated, became a day of national mourning in solidarity with Romania.

== Timeline ==

The chart below shows a timeline of the offices held by Vujanović and the Montenegro status. The left bar shows the president and all prime minister&#x27;s terms of Vujanović, and the right bar shows the country status of Montenegro at that time.
==Personal life==
Since May 1985, he has been married to Svetlana Vujanović, a court judge, with whom he has three children: two daughters (Tatjana and Nina), and a son (Danilo). Vujanović stands in height making him among the tallest statesmen in the world.

<doc id="725707" wikidata="Q594930" url="?curid=725707" title="Plymouth Barracuda">
<text>The Plymouth Barracuda is a two-door pony car that was manufactured by Chrysler Corporation from 1964 through 1974 model years.

The first-generation Barracuda was based on the Chrysler A-body and was offered from 1964 until 1966. A two-door hardtop (no B-pillar) fastback design, it shared a great majority of parts and bodywork with the Plymouth Valiant, except for the distinctive wraparound rear glass.

The second-generation Barracuda, though still Valiant-based, was heavily redesigned. Built from 1967 through 1969, it was available as a two-door in fastback, notchback, and convertible versions.

The third generation, offered from 1970 until 1974, was based on the Chrysler E-body, exclusive to it, and the slightly larger Dodge Challenger. A completely new design, the two-door Barracuda was available in hardtop and convertible body styles. 

==First generation (1964–1966)==
===1964===
During the development of the Barracuda, one of the worst-kept secrets was Ford&#x27;s plan to introduce a new sporty compact car based on the inexpensive Falcon chassis and running gear (which was eventually released as the Mustang in mid-model year 1964); the extent of the other changes was not known. Chrysler stylist Irv Ritchie sketched a fastback version of the compact Valiant. Budgets were limited due to research and development of the Chrysler Turbine Car, but the company&#x27;s executives wanted to have an entry in this emerging and potentially lucrative sporty-compact car market segment, beginning by siphoning off some of the Chevrolet&#x27;s Corvair Monza&#x27;s sales. Plymouth&#x27;s executives had wanted to name the new model &quot;Panda&quot;, an idea unpopular with its designers. In the end, John Samsen&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;Barracuda&quot; prevailed.

Based on Chrysler&#x27;s A-body, the Barracuda debuted in fastback form on April 1, 1964. The new model used the Valiant&#x27;s wheelbase and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent windows, quarter panels, doors, A-pillar, and bumpers; the trunk and some of the glass was new. Using the same hybrid design approach as Ford did turning its Falcon into the Mustang significantly reduced Plymouth&#x27;s development and tooling cost and time for the new model. The greatest effort was put into creating its distinguishing rear window, a collaboration between Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) and Chrysler designers that created the largest ever installed on a standard production car to that time.

Powertrains were identical to the Valiant&#x27;s, including two versions of Chrysler&#x27;s slant-6 six-cylinder engine. The standard-equipment engine had a displacement of and an output of ; the option raised the power output to .

The highest-power option for 1964 was Chrysler&#x27;s all-new LA V8. A compact and relatively light engine equipped with a two-barrel carburetor, it produced . The Barracuda sold for a base price of US$2,512 ($ today).

The 1964 model year was the first for the Barracuda and also the last year for push-button control of the optional Torqueflite automatic transmission. This year also marked the first use of the smaller &quot;TorqueFlite 6&quot; (A904) transmission behind a V8.

In the marketplace, the Barracuda was obviously a fastback version of the Valiant that had a frugal family transportation image. The sales brochure for the first Barracudas pitched it as a car &quot;for people of all ages and interests.&quot; The more sporty Mustang was marketed with abundant advertising to young professionals and with its youthful image proved widely successful following its mid-1964 introduction. This became known as the &quot;pony car&quot; niche of modestly appointed compact-sized sedans and convertibles, which came with standard 6-cylinder engines and basic interiors, but could be outfitted with powerful V8s and &quot;custom&quot; appointments and luxury features. The success of the Mustang has long obscured the fact that the Barracuda actually predated Ford&#x27;s introduction by two weeks. The abbreviated sales season for the 1964 Barracuda totaled 23,443 units compared to the 126,538 Mustangs sold during the same time.

===1965===

In 1965, the 225 slant-6 became the base engine for the U.S. market, though the remained the base engine in Canada.

New options were introduced for the Barracuda as the competition among pony cars intensified. The 273 engine was made available as an upgraded &quot;Commando&quot; version with a four-barrel carburetor, 10.5:1 compression, and a more aggressive camshaft, still with solid tappets. These and other upgrades increased the engine&#x27;s output to .

A new &quot;Formula &#x27;S&#x27; &quot; package included the Commando V8 engine, suspension upgrades, larger wheels and tires, special emblems, and a tachometer. Disc brakes and factory-installed air conditioning became available after the start of the 1965 model year.

===1966===

For the 1966 model year the Barracuda received new taillamps, new front sheet metal, and a new instrument panel. The latter had room for oil pressure and tachometer gauges on models so equipped. The 1966 front sheet metal which, except for the grille, was shared with the Valiant, gave a more rectilinear contour to the fenders. Deluxe models featured fender-top turn signal indicators with a stylized fin motif. The bumpers were larger, and the grille featured a strong grid theme. A center console was optional for the first time.

Although the first Barracudas were heavily based on the contemporary Valiants, Plymouth wanted them perceived as distinct models. Consequently, the &quot;Valiant&quot; chrome script that appeared on the model&#x27;s trunk lid was phased out at the end of the 1965 model year in the U.S. market, and the large stylized &quot;V&quot; trim above the deck lid was changed to a unique Barracuda fish logo for 1966, though in markets such as Canada and South Africa, where Valiant was a marque in its own right, the car remained badged as &quot;Valiant Barracuda&quot; until the A-body Barracuda was discontinued.

==Second generation (1967–1969)==
===1967===
The second-generation Barracuda was redesigned with model-specific sheet metal, yet still shared many components with the Valiant. It rode on a wheelbase A-body and was available as a convertible,and a notchback coupe, in addition to the fastback design.

The new Barracuda was chiefly the work of John E. Herlitz and John Samsen, with Coke-bottle side contours and heavily revised front and rear ends. Design changes included wider wheel openings, curved side glass, and S-curved roof pillars on the hardtop.

The roofline on the fastback coupe was more streamlined, more steeply raked, and with a much smaller flush rear window in place of the distinctive massive wraparound in the original model. Also, the overall use of chrome trim was more restrained.

During this time the first U.S. Federal auto safety standards were phased in, and Chrysler&#x27;s response a requirement for side-marker lights distinguishes each model year of the second-generation Barracuda:

*1967: no sidemarker lamps or reflectors, and backup lights on the rear valance by the license plate.
*1968: round side marker lamps without reflectors, mostly white tail lamps with backup lights in the tail lamp housing.
*1969: little changes on the front grille, rectangular side marker reflectors without lamps, and the backup lamps were moved back to the rear valance by the license plate.

As the pony-car class became established and competition increased, Plymouth began to revise the Barracuda&#x27;s engine options.

In 1967, while the slant-6 was still the base engine, the V8 options ranged from the two- and four-barrel versions of the to a seldom-ordered &quot;B&quot; big-block, rated at , the latter available only with the &quot;Formula S&quot; package.

===1968===
In 1968, the 273 was replaced by the LA engine as the smallest V8 available, and the new LA four-barrel was released. The 383 Super Commando engine was upgraded with the intake manifold, camshaft, and cylinder heads from the Road Runner and Super Bee, but the more restrictive exhaust manifolds specific to the A-body cars limited its output to .

Also in 1968, Chrysler made approximately fifty fastback Barracudas equipped with the Hemi for Super Stock drag racing. These cars were assembled by Hurst Performance and featured items such as lightweight Chemcor side glass, fiberglass front fenders, hood scoop, lightweight seats, sound deadener, and other street features such as rear seats omitted. An included sticker indicated that the car was not for use on public roads; it could run the quarter-mile in the mid-tens in 1968.

For the South African export market, a high-performance version of the 225 slant-6 called &quot;Charger Power&quot; was offered with 9.3:1 compression, two-barrel carburetor, more aggressive camshaft, and low-restriction exhaust system. A handful of Savage GTs were also built from the second-generation Barracuda.

===1969===
In 1969, Plymouth placed an increased emphasis on performance. A new option was the &quot;Mod Top&quot;, a vinyl roof covering with a floral motif, available in 1969 and 1970. Plymouth sold it as a package with seat and door panel inserts done in the same pattern.

The 1969 version of the 383 engine was upgraded to increase power output to , and a new trim package called&quot; &#x27;Cuda&quot; was released. The &#x27;Cuda, based on the Formula S option, was available with either the 340, 383 and, new for 1969, the 440 Super Commando V8.
==Third generation (1970–1974)==
===1970–1971===
The all-new 1970 Barracuda was styled by John E. Herlitz and built on a shorter, wider version of Chrysler&#x27;s existing B platform, called the E-body. The redesign removed all previous commonality with the Valiant. The fastback model was deleted from the line and the Barracuda was only offered in coupe and convertible models. Though sharing its platform with the newly launched Dodge Challenger, no exterior sheet-metal was shared between the two. The Challenger&#x27;s wheelbase was longer than the Barracuda&#x27;s, and its body longer.

The E-body Barracuda was now &quot;able to shake the stigma of &#x27;economy car&#x27;.&quot; Three versions were offered for 1970 and 1971: the base Barracuda (BH), the luxury oriented Gran Coupe (BP), and the sport model &#x27;Cuda (BS). 

Beginning mid-year 1970, and ending with the 1971 model, there also was the Barracuda Coupe (A93), a low-end model with the Slant Six as a base engine, lower-grade interior, and (like other Coupe series Chrysler offered that year) had fixed quarter glass instead of roll-down rear passenger windows. The high-performance models were marketed as&quot; &#x27;Cuda&quot; deriving from the 1969 option. The E-body&#x27;s engine bay was larger than that of the previous A-body, facilitating the use of Chrysler&#x27;s Hemi.

For 1970 and 1971, the Barracuda and Barracuda Gran Coupe had two slant I6 engines available — a new version and the previous 225 — as well as four V8 options: the 318 CID, the 383 with a two-barrel carburetor and single exhaust, the with a four-barrel and dual exhausts, and the 383 Magnum with a four-barrel and dual exhausts SAE gross. 

The &#x27;Cuda model had the 383 SAE gross (same as Dodge&#x27;s 383 Magnum) as the standard engine. Options included the , AAR &quot;Six Barrel&quot;, with triple 2-barrel carburetors, a four-barrel Super Commando, the 440 Six Barrel with triple 2-barrel carburetors with a gross rating of , and the Hemi. The 440- and Hemi-equipped cars received upgraded suspension components and structural reinforcements to help transfer the power to the road.
 

Other Barracuda options included decal sets, hood modifications, and some unusual &quot;high impact&quot; colors such as &quot;Lime Light&quot;, &quot;Bahama Yellow&quot;, &quot;Tor Red&quot;, &quot;Lemon Twist&quot;, &quot;Curious Yellow&quot;, &quot;Vitamin C&quot;, &quot;In-Violet&quot;, &quot;Sassy Grass&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;.

Swede Savage and Dan Gurney raced identical factory-sponsored AAR (All American Racers) &#x27;Cudas in the 1970 Trans-Am Series. The cars qualified for three pole positions but did not win any Trans-Am races; the highest finish was second at Road America. Four 1970 Hemi &#x27;Cudas were also successfully raced by Chrysler France, from 1970 until 1973. The works team director Henrí Chemin piloted the first car, and then sold it on to friend and privateer J. F. Mas who went on to race it for another two years. This Hemi &#x27;Cuda won four French Group 1 class championships, three on track and one in hill climbing.

The Barracuda was changed slightly for 1971, with a new grille and taillights, seat, and trim differences. This would be the only year that the Barracuda would have four headlights (which the Challenger had for all five years of their concurrent run), and also the only year of the fender &quot;gills&quot; on the &#x27;Cuda model. Only 1970 &#x27;Cuda models received a &quot;hockey stick&quot; stripe with an engine call out within it, where as 1971 &#x27;Cudas were the only year that had the full side &quot;Billboard&quot; decal with the engine call out inside of the billboard decal.

The 1971 Barracuda engine options would remain the same as that of the 1970 model, except that the 340 6-Bbl was gone, and the four-barrel carbureted 440 V8 engine was no longer on the options list, but could be had via special order and perhaps a dozen cars were built with it installed; otherwise, the 440-powered Barracudas had a six-barrel carburetor setup instead.

In 1971 the big-block power options offered to the customer were:
# SAE Gross in the 383-2V
# SAE Gross in the 383-4V
# SAE Gross in the 440-6V
# SAE Gross in the 426-8V

In 1970 and 1971 only, the shaker hood (option code N96), elastomeric (rubber) colored bumpers, and the Spicer-built Dana 60 rear axle were available. The shaker hood was available with 340, 383, 440 four-barrel, 440 six-barrel, and 426 Hemi engines. The elastomeric (rubber) colored bumpers were available either as a front-only option, option code A21, or as a front and rear combination, option code A22. The heavy-duty (and heavy) Dana 60, with a ring gear, was standard equipment with manual transmissions and 440 six-barrel and 426 Hemi engines, and was optional on those with the automatic transmission. 1971 Barracudas with floor shifted transmissions received a new column key release, where as 1970 models had a backdrive linkage for key removal.

===1972–1974===

With a new grille and single headlights (very similar to the 1970 model) and four circular taillights for 1972, the Barracuda would remain basically unchanged through 1974, with new bodyside stripes, and minor changes to the bumpers to conform with federal impact standards being the only significant variations. In 1973 the shape of the pedals was changed from a trapezoid shape with a fine horizontal pattern that was original to the shape of the 1970, where as 1973 and later had larger rectangle shaped clutch and brake pedals with thicker horizontal grooves that would remain similar to most all Chrysler products through the 1980s. There was also a corresponding gas pedal that matched the aforemtioned brake and clutch style variations. With this change of pedal shape the brake and clutch supporting members were forged differently, and the pads were not interchangeable. 1972 was also the last year for the basket-weave pattern in the seats, where as the next two years, seats had a different cost saving coachman grain pattern vinyl with different bucket seat backs. 

Big block engines (383, 440, &amp; 426 Hemi), heavy-duty suspensions, Dana 60 rear axle, large/wide tires mounted on wheels were no longer offered. 

Additionally; the convertible model was dropped; though a few late build 1971 convertibles were built with 1972 grills and back end panels and provided to Paramount Studios for TV and movie work; being seen on &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and other shows. 

Convenience and comfort items such as power seats, power windows, and upgraded interior (leather seats and plush carpeting) options were dropped, though heavy-duty air conditioning and a sunroof could still be ordered. 

For 1972 only, three engine choices were offered: a 225 six, the 318 (base engine for both &#x27;Cuda and Barracuda), and a revised 340 detuned to meet emission standards. In addition, all three were tuned to run on low/no-lead gas and were power rated on the NET (installed) method. Three transmissions were offered: a 3-speed manual, the Torqueflite automatic, and the &quot;Hurst&quot; shifter equipped four-speed. 

For 1973 federally mandated safety bumpers were added front and rear, and the 225 six was dropped, with the 318 and 340 V8s being the only engine choices. For late production 1973 cars, and for 1974 a slightly more powerful 360 V8 (245 E bodyhp) replaced the 340. Since 1970; optional was a four-speed manual transmission (equipped with a Hurst shifter) mated to a performance ratio (3.55 to 1) rear axle for the 340 and 360 engines, though as many as three cars (in both 1973 and 1974) were built with the 318 engine and Hurst 4-speed thru special orders or factory errors.

As with other American vehicles of the time, there was a progressive decrease in the Barracuda&#x27;s performance. To meet increasingly stringent safety and exhaust emission regulations, big-block engine options were discontinued. The remaining engines were detuned year by year to reduce exhaust emissions, which also reduced their power output. There was also an increase in weight as bumpers became larger and, starting in 1970, E-body doors were equipped with heavy steel side-impact protection beams. Higher fuel prices following the 1973 oil crisis and performance-car insurance surcharges deterred many buyers as the interest in high-performance cars waned. Sales of pony cars were on the decline. Sales had dropped dramatically after 1970, and while 1973 showed a sales uptick, Barracuda production ended April 1, 1974, ten years to the day after it had begun.

===Engines===
Engine choices by Chrysler for the 1970-73 Barracuda included the following:
* B: Slant 6 I6: 1970–71 SAE gross, 1972 SAE net
* C: Slant 6 I6: 1970–71 SAE gross, 1971-72 SAE net

SAE gross hp ratings were tested with no accessories, no air cleaner, or open headers. In 1971, compression ratios were reduced in performance engines, except the 426 cu in and the high-performance 440 cu in, to accommodate regular gasoline. 1971 was the last year for the 426 Hemi.

Chrysler had plans to continue the 1970 Dodge Challenger T/A for 1971, even publishing advertisements for a 1971 Dodge Challenger T/A. However, no 1971 Dodge Challenger T/A was made. Similarly, no 1971 Plymouth AAR Cuda was made.

==Discontinuation==
The Barracuda was discontinued after 1974, a victim of the 1973 energy crisis.

A 1975 Barracuda had been planned before the end of the 1970-74 model cycle. Plymouth engineers sculpted two separate concepts out of clay, both featuring a Superbird-inspired aerodynamic body, and eventually reached a consensus upon which an operational concept car could be built. Due to a rapidly changing automotive market due to the energy crisis, the concepts were scrapped and the Barracuda was not put into production for 1975. 

===Revival attempts===
In 2007, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine reported a rumor that Chrysler was considering reviving the Barracuda in 2009. A new Barracuda would&#x27;ve been badged as a Chrysler, due to the Plymouth brand having been phased out in 2001. However, the Barracuda has not been reintroduced alongside the third generation Dodge Challenger. Rumors of the Barracuda making a comeback were brought up again by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; in 2012 when reports leaked that the Barracuda would come back in 2014 under the SRT Marque, &quot;replacing&quot; the Challenger instead of being built alongside it. It was also stated the car would not be of a retro design. Ultimately, the SRT division was re-consolidated under the Dodge banner and the Challenger remained in production without a Barracuda replacement.

After years of silence, an all-new Barracuda, now under the Dodge brand, was shown to FCA dealers along with other future vehicles on August 25, 2015. Based on stretched underpinnings of the rear-drive Alfa Romeo Giulia, it was rumored to be powered by a turbocharged V6 and arrive within the 2019 model year. As of 2025, a new Barracuda model has not materialized.

==Collectibility==
The Barracuda (particularly the 1970–1974 E-Body cars) is a collectible car today, with high-performance versions and convertibles commanding the highest prices. The small number of Barracudas remaining in existence is the result of low buyer interest (and low production/sales) when the vehicles were new. The remaining cars of any condition are rare, and the outstanding examples fetch high appraisal values today. Original Hemi super stock Barracudas (and similarly configured Dodge Darts) are now prized collector vehicles, with factory (unaltered) cars commanding high prices.

The 1971 Hemi &#x27;Cuda convertible is now considered one of the most valuable collectible muscle cars. Only thirteen were built, seven of which were sold domestically. The most recent public sale was at the June 2014 Mecum auction in Seattle, where a blue-on-blue 4-speed sold for US$3.5 million (plus buyers premium). Several replica cars were created to look like Hemi &#x27;Cudas and driven by the title character in the late-1990s police procedural &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. None of these replica cars had a Hemi V8 under the hood.

<text>Max&#x27;s Kansas City was a nightclub and restaurant at 213 Park Avenue South in New York City, which became a gathering spot for musicians, poets, artists, and politicians in the 1960s and 1970s. It was opened by Mickey Ruskin (1933–1983) in December 1965 and closed in 1981.

==History==

===Max&#x27;s I===
Max&#x27;s quickly became a hangout of choice for artists and sculptors of the New York School, like John Chamberlain, Robert Rauschenberg and Larry Rivers, whose presence attracted hip celebrities and the jet set. Neil Williams, Larry Zox, Forrest (Frosty) Myers, Larry Poons, Brice Marden, Bob Neuwirth, Dan Christensen, Ronnie Landfield, Ching Ho Cheng, Richard Bernstein, Peter Reginato, Carl Andre, Dan Graham, Lawrence Weiner, Robert Smithson, Joseph Kosuth, Brigid Berlin, Viva, Edie Sedgwick, David R. Prentice, Roy Lichtenstein, Peter Forakis, Peter Young, Mark di Suvero, Pat Lipsky, Larry Bell, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Richard Serra, Lee Lozano, Carlos Villa, Jack Whitten, Edward Leffingwell, Philip Glass, Max Neuhaus, Ray Johnson, Malcolm Morley, Lotti Golden, Marjorie Strider, Edward Avedisian, Carolee Schneemann, Dorothea Rockburne, Norman Bluhm, Kenneth Showell, Robert Tex Wray, John Griefen, Colette Justine, Lenore Jaffee, Tally Brown, Taylor Mead, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, René Ricard, Richard Gallo, Stephen Shore, Marta Minujín, and Marisol were just some of the artists seen regularly at Max&#x27;s. Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Henry Geldzahler, art critics Lucy Lippard, Robert Hughes, Clement Greenberg, and Harold Rosenberg, art dealers Leo Castelli, and David Whitney, whose gallery was across the street, writers Lillian Roxon, Fran Lebowitz, Germaine Greer, and architect Philip Johnson occasionally would be seen there as well.

It was also a favorite hangout of Andy Warhol and his entourage, who dominated the back room. The Velvet Underground played there regularly, including their last shows with Lou Reed before he quit the band, in the summer of 1970. It was a home base for the glam rock scene, which included Marc Bolan, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Alice Cooper, the New York Dolls, Jayne County (then Wayne County), Dorian Zero and the Magic Tramps. While her band did not play there until the second incarnation of the club, Patti Smith and her boyfriend, artist Robert Mapplethorpe, visited Max&#x27;s almost nightly from 1969 through the early 1970s, before it began booking punk rock bands. Smith and guitarist Lenny Kaye also performed there as a duo on New Year&#x27;s Day 1974, opening for Phil Ochs. Many bands made early appearances there. Bruce Springsteen played a solo acoustic set in the summer of 1972. He also played sets at the club on November 6, 7, and 8, 1973. It was the site of Aerosmith&#x27;s first New York City gig. Columbia Records president Clive Davis later signed Aerosmith to his record label there, as referred in the band&#x27;s 1979 song &quot;No Surprize&quot;. Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers opened for Bruce Springsteen at Max&#x27;s, commencing Marley&#x27;s career on the international circuit. Iggy and the Stooges performed a string of shows in July and August 1973. Big Star performed two shows in December 1973. Tim Buckley, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Odetta, Eddie Mottau, Dave Van Ronk, John Herald, Garland Jeffreys, Sylvia Tyson, Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, Elliott Murphy and Country Joe McDonald were some of the musicians that also played there. Fashion designer Carlos Falchi was a busboy, as was artist, publisher and filmmaker Anton Perich; Deborah Harry was a waitress there.

By the end of 1974, Max&#x27;s had lost popularity among the art crowd and the glam era was in decline. It closed in December of that year. New York City mayor Ed Koch later had a campaign office in the building. In 2015 photographer Marcia Resnick documented the people at Max&#x27;s in her book &quot;Punks, Poets, and Provocateurs: New York City Bad Boys, 1977–1982&quot;.

===Mickey Ruskin===
Shortly after graduating from Cornell Law School, Mickey Ruskin opened The Tenth Street Coffeehouse, which featured nightly poetry readings. He then opened Les Deux Megots on East Ninth Street. His next endeavor was a bar called the Ninth Circle Steak House, a hangout for artists and musicians on West 10th Street. After opening Max&#x27;s Kansas City, he opened similar restaurants including: the Longview Country Club (later known as Levine&#x27;s Restaurant) which was on 19th Street and Park Avenue South, diagonally across the street from Max&#x27;s and Max&#x27;s Terre Haute, on the Upper East Side, but they did not do as well. His next club was The Locale on Waverly Place that he opened with partner Richard Sanders. Sanders kept The Locale and Mickey went on to The Lower Manhattan Ocean Club, on Chambers Street in TriBeCa. Ruskin&#x27;s last enterprise was Chinese Chance (nicknamed One U), a bar and restaurant that he opened with partner Sanders, located at 1 University Place in Greenwich Village. The French composer Duncan Youngerman and the poet and mail artist Adam Czarnowski both worked there as busboys. Lauren Hutton, Ellen Barkin, Gerard Malanga, Joe Jackson, Joni Mitchell, Nico, David Bowie and a score of other Lower Manhattan celebs hung out there, as well as the artists that formerly frequented Max&#x27;s and the doormen of the Mudd Club. Ruskin died in New York City on May 16, 1983, at the age of 50.

===Max&#x27;s II===
Max&#x27;s Kansas City reopened in 1975 under the ownership of Tommy Dean Mills, who initially thought he would make it a disco. Peter Crowley, who had been booking the same early punk bands that played at CBGB and Mothers, a gay bar on West 23rd Street, was hired to book bands at Max&#x27;s.

Under Crowley&#x27;s guidance the club became one of the birthplaces of punk, regularly featuring bands including Cherry Vanilla, Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs, Ruby and the Rednecks, The Offs, The Fast, Suicide (who all appeared on the compilation album &quot;1976 Max&#x27;s Kansas City&quot;), the New York Dolls, Patti Smith Group, the Ramones, the Mumps, the Heartbreakers, Television, Blondie, Talking Heads, Sniper, the Dictators, the Cramps, Mink DeVille, Misfits, Little Annie, the Fleshtones, the B-52&#x27;s, the Stimulators, the Bongos and Klaus Nomi, as well as out-of-town bands such as the Runaways and the Damned. After the breakup of the Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious played all of his US solo gigs there. Devo played several shows at Max&#x27;s in 1977, including a show where they were introduced by David Bowie as &quot;the band of the future.&quot;
Max&#x27;s Kansas City is mentioned in the Sex Pistols&#x27; song &quot;New York&quot; from &quot;Never Mind The Bollocks&quot; album, 1976.

Max&#x27;s original site closed in November 1981. Bad Brains were the headliners on the final night, with the Beastie Boys opening. The building survives and in 2010 was found to house a Korean deli.

===Max&#x27;s III===
Mills reopened the club again on January 27, 1998, at a new location—240 West 52nd Street—site of the former Lone Star Roadhouse. However, it closed shortly after opening.

The opening had been delayed due to litigation by Ruskin&#x27;s partner, Yvonne Sewall-Ruskin, who claimed that she owned the trademark to Max&#x27;s Kansas City and was granted a temporary restraining order to prevent use of the name.

===Aftermath===
In 2000, Acidwork Productions, Inc., a production company founded by Neil Holstein (second cousin of Mickey Ruskin) began working in conjunction with Victoria Ruskin (Mickey Ruskin&#x27;s daughter) on a feature-length documentary about Mickey Ruskin and his many establishments, including Max&#x27;s Kansas City.

In 2001, Yvonne Sewall-Ruskin established the Max&#x27;s Kansas City Project. In the spirit of Ruskin&#x27;s philosophy of helping artists in need, the project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, provides emergency funding and resources for individuals in the arts in crisis. The nonprofit is also dedicated to empowering teens through the arts.

<text>The Chocolate Watchband is an American garage rock band that formed in 1965 in Los Altos, California. The band went through several lineup changes during its existence. Combining psychedelic and garage rock components, their sound was marked by David Aguilar&#x27;s lead vocals, songwriting, as well as proto-punk musical arrangements. The band&#x27;s rebellious musical posture made them one of the harder-edged groups of the period with one critic labeling them as America&#x27;s answer to the Rolling Stones.

The Chocolate Watchband was signed to Tower Records in 1966 and released their first single, &quot;Sweet Young Thing&quot;, in 1967. Later in the year, the band released their debut album, &quot;No Way Out&quot;. Although the album did not chart nationally, the band had a huge following in San Jose and the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1968, their second album, &quot;The Inner Mystique&quot;, was released and included the band&#x27;s most popular song, a cover version of &quot;I&#x27;m Not Like Everybody Else&quot;. By 1969, with Mark Loomis dropping out in the middle of the recording sessions, the band released a final album, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, however it did not include David Aguilar on vocals and was not as highly regarded or indicative of their past work. The Chocolate Watchband officially broke up in 1970 with no intent of ever reuniting; however, they reunited in 1999.

==History==
===1965: early line-up===
The Chocolate Watchband was formed in the summer of 1965 in Los Altos, California by Ned Torney and Mark Loomis, who had previously played guitar together in a local band known as The Chaparrals in the previous year. The two were joined by Rick Young (bass guitar), Pete Curry (drums), Jo Kemling (organ), and Danny Phay (lead vocals) to form the first version of the Chocolate Watchband, a name that was originally meant to be taken as a joke. All five musicians had a background rooted in rock and roll and blues, with each one having spent time on the local club circuit. The band garnered a local following, integrating cover versions of British Invasion groups, particularly The Who, into their live repertoire. Curry was soon replaced by Gary Andrijasevich, a jazz drummer from Cupertino High School. They never recorded any commercial releases, but rare demos by the group appeared in the 1990s. The band was gaining popularity until Torney and Phay accepted an offer from a rival band, The Otherside, to join their group. Kemling followed soon after, effectively dismantling the first incarnation of the band.

===1966–67: Loomis–Aguilar line-up ===
With the first version of the Chocolate Watchband disbanded, Mark Loomis moved on to join The Shandels. Quickly becoming disillusioned, he took the discarded name &quot;Chocolate Watchband&quot; and recruited The Shandels&#x27; bass player Bill &#x27;Flo&#x27; Flores and former Watchband drummer, Gary Andrijasevich. Next he convinced former Topsiders guitarist Dave &quot;Sean&quot; Tolby to enlist. The group recruited David Aguilar as the frontman and lead singer; at the time, Aguilar was a college student studying biology at San Jose State University.

Loomis naturally asserted the role of leader during this initial time period, although the band never acknowledged it had a designated leader. Songs to cover were presented, shows were talked about, the band voted together on all decisions. Sean Tolby obtained the latest in Vox equipment while Loomis provided the space for nightly rehearsals. Within a week, the band began performing at local clubs in San Francisco&#x27;s South Bay, playing a range of songs that included obscure British import tunes that hadn&#x27;t been released in the USA, so that unlike other local bands who were covering the latest hits from the Top 10, the Chocolate Watchband played songs few people had heard before. Thus, in many instances, these songs became associated with the Chocolate Watchband and not the original artists.

Six months later, after opening for the Mothers of Invention at the Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco music producer Bill Graham urged the Chocolate Watchband to sign a management contract with him. He was opening up a new Fillmore East in New York City and wanted to shuttle the Chocolate Watchband, the Grateful Dead, and Jefferson Airplane back and forth from coast to coast as his personal house bands. However, having signed a management contract with local promoter Ron Roupe a week earlier, their future followed a different path. Roupe, having secured a recording deal with Green Grass Productions in Los Angeles, introduced the band to producers Ed Cobb and Ray Harris. The band flew to Los Angeles and entered the recording studio; as a warm-up to show Cobb their capabilities, they quickly recorded tracks for &quot;Come On,&quot; a Chuck Berry song that had also been the first single recorded by the Rolling Stones, to whom the band was frequently compared. Cobb introduced the band to a song he had written a week earlier named &quot;Sweet Young Thing&quot;. Released in December 1966 by Tower Records, the B-side featured the group&#x27;s cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;, another song the band regularly played live. However, unknown to the Watchband, Tower Records farmed the distribution of their recordings out to Uptown Records, a rhythm and blues label with predominantly black artists.

Frontman Aguilar began writing material for the band, including originals like &quot;Right By My Side&quot;, &quot;Gone &amp; Passes By&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Need Your Lovin&#x27; Anymore&quot;, &quot;No Way Out&quot; and &quot;Sitting There Standing.&quot; The band&#x27;s second single was the more restrained track &quot;Misty Lane&quot;, released with a sweet orchestrated ballad, &quot;She Weaves a Tender Trap&quot;, as its B-side. During this period the band were featured in two Sam Katzman films: &quot;Riot on Sunset Strip&quot; and &quot;The Love-Ins&quot;. The latter film inspired the group&#x27;s next single; &quot;Are You Gonna Be There At The Love-In&quot;, which was written and recorded in one day. The single was released with the B-side &quot;No Way Out&quot;, an instrumental spawned from a studio warm-up with spontaneous Aguilar vocals that Cobb later took credit for. In late 1967, shortly after the release of their first album, &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1967) Aguilar left for university studies in science while the other members searched for ways to continue playing music.

===1967–69: reformation and dissolution ===
Loomis and Andrijasevich would depart after Aguilar, leaving Tolby and Flores with the duty of fulfilling a month&#x27;s worth of bookings. They decided to enlist the services of Tim Abbott, Mark Whittaker and Chris Flinders, members of the San Francisco Bay Blues Band. The band still maintained a level of success, but the sound and style differed from the original band. They managed to secure a place as the opening act for The Doors, and also performed at the KFRC Magic Mountain Festival—the first rock music festival in the United States—among thirty other bands in June 1967. The group played several dates, including the Oakland Coliseum until late 1967, when Abbott and Flinders had a disagreement with Tolby and manager Ron Roupe over financial matters, which ensured the indefinite break-up of the Watchband in December 1967.

During recording sessions for the Chocolate Watchband&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Inner Mystique&quot;, the band chafed at Cobb&#x27;s influence because he presented them as being more instrumentally refined on record than they were live. Less than half of the featured studio work was by official members of the band; the majority of the record featured session musicians, and a singer named Don Bennett contributed vocals on the track &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Girls.&quot; The album also included a song written by Cobb, &quot;Medication&quot;, which was already done by The Standells, who Cobb also managed. 

The band reformed in late 1968 for a short period of time, with Danny Phay, the group&#x27;s original vocalist in its 1965 inception, re-joining the band, as well as guitarist Ned Torney; bassist Bill Flores and guitarist Sean Tolby from the 1967 line-up remained. A third studio album, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, was recorded with Cobb again using session musicians, and sometimes entire ghost bands, to record portions of it. It was a commercial failure except for the songs written and sung by David Aguilar that were put in on the album from past recording sessions. One of the tracks - &quot;Devil&#x27;s Motorcycle&quot; - featured Moby Grape guitarist Jerry Miller.

===1999–present: revival===
After their dissolution in 1970, a revival of interest in psychedelic and garage rock in the late 1980s and 1990s brought the group to public attention, and their original vinyl releases became collectors&#x27; items, selling among private sellers for over USD$100. Rhino Records issued a best-of release of the band in 1983, while Sundazed and other labels re-issued the original albums on compact discs, including bonus tracks. After leaving the band, its members each embarked on other non-musical pursuits; Aguilar had worked as an astronomy professor after the band&#x27;s dissolution.

Continued interest prompted the band to reunite in 1999, with Dave Aguilar, Tim Abbott (replacing Mark Loomis, who backed out of the reunion), Bill Flores, and Gary Andrijasevich; Michael Reese was added as guitarist in place of Sean Tolby. The group began to touring internationally in 2000, culminating in a show at New York&#x27;s Cavestomp and a live album, &quot;At the Love-In Live!&quot; in 2001. They also issued a studio album,&quot;Get Away&quot;, in between the Cavestomp show and the live album. The group has since performed in Europe and the United States. In 2005, &quot;Melts in Your Brain . . . Not on Your Wrist&quot;, a two-CD compilation of the Chocolate Watchband&#x27;s complete Tower and Uptown recordings, was released. 

In June 2013, the Chocolate Watchband made it back to a recording studio in their hometown San Jose, to begin a new album. From 2015 to the present (2018), the band&#x27;s lineup is Tim Abbott on lead guitar and vocals; Gary Andrijasevich on drums; David Aguilar on vocals, keyboards, and harmonica; Alec Palao on bass and backing vocals; and Derek See on guitar and vocals. The resulting album (&quot;This Is My Voice&quot;) was released in 2019 to critical acclaim; the lead off single &#x27;Secret Rendezvous&#x27; was featured as &#x27;Coolest Song In The World&#x27; on Little Steven&#x27;s Underground Garage program in February 2019.

The first song recorded was a tribute to Sky Saxon who had recently died. Founding member Mark Loomis died on September 26, 2014, in Hawaii.

From David Aguilar: 
This is a sad moment for all of us in the band. I never quite understood Mark&#x27;s withdrawal and leaving, but in later years he expressed deep regret in breaking up the band. However, at that point in time there was no way to revive that magical moment in time. I always marveled at his guitar work and as time passed, my admiration for his musical abilities and unique guitar playing grew like the expanding universe. I can&#x27;t express how sad I feel knowing all that is now permanently behind us. In my heart all I can say is thank you Mark for making the Watchband happen. And thank you for selecting me as your lead singer. With our fans - your musical notes will always play on.

<text>Best Western International, Inc. owns the Best Western Hotels &amp; Resorts brand, which it licenses to over 4,700 hotels worldwide. The franchise, with its corporate headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, includes more than 2,000 hotels in North America. The brand was founded by M. K. Guertin in 1946. As of December 2021, Larry Cuculic is the president and CEO of Best Western. As of 2018, it was nonprofit owned by its franchisee members.

In 1964 Canadian hotel owners joined the system. Best Western then expanded to Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand in 1976.

In 2002 Best Western International launched &quot;Best Western Premier&quot; in Europe and Asia. (The other hotels in the chain were known as &quot;Best Western&quot;.) In 2011, the chain&#x27;s branding system-wide changed to a three-tiered system: &quot;Best Western&quot;, &quot;Best Western Plus&quot;, and &quot;Best Western Premier&quot;.

== History ==
Best Western began in the years following World War II. At the time, most hotels were either large urban properties or smaller family-owned roadside hotels. In California, a network of independent hotel operators began making referrals of each other to travelers. This &quot;referral system&quot; consisted of phone calls between one desk operator and another. This small and informal network eventually grew into the modern Best Western hotel brand founded by M.K. Guertin in 1946.

The name &quot;Best Western&quot; originated from the fact that most of the chain&#x27;s original operators were west of the Mississippi River in the United States. By 1962 Best Western had the only hospitality reservations service covering the entire United States, and in 1963, was the largest motel brand in the industry with 699 member properties and 35,201 rooms. From 1946 to 1964 Best Western had a marketing partnership with Quality Courts, the forerunner of the chain known today as Quality Inns, whose properties were located mostly east of the Mississippi River, and thus not in direct competition with Best Western. This partnership made sense geographically, but was not successful in the long run, and was eventually abandoned. In 1964 Best Western launched an expansion effort of its own operations east of the Mississippi under the name &quot;Best Eastern&quot; for those properties with the same typeset and Gold Crown logo as &quot;Best Western.&quot; By 1967 the &quot;Best Eastern&quot; name was dropped and all motels from coast-to-coast got the &quot;Best Western&quot; name and Gold Crown, a move that would further enhance an already successful marketing brand into the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Hotel Chain&quot; by the 1970s. 

Best Western&#x27;s &quot;Gold Crown&quot; logo was introduced in 1964 and would continue with a few minor revisions over the next 32 years, until it was replaced by a blue and yellow logo in 1996. In 2015, Best Western introduced a new family of logos, replacing the core logo and adding signage for Best Western Plus and Best Western Premier.

Best Western purchased WorldHotels in February 2019 adding approximately 360 additional hotels and 81,248 more rooms to its brand. BWH Hotel Group was formed as the parent company of Best Western and WorldHotels following this acquisition.

=== Legal dispute ===
Best Western used to call itself a cooperative membership association and, as such, could be seen as a co-op. Around 1985, it abandoned the &quot;cooperative&quot; terminology after courts insisted on calling it a franchisor despite its nonprofit status. In &quot;Quist v. Best Western Int&#x27;l, Inc.&quot;, 354 N.W.2d 656 (N.D. 1984), in which the North Dakota Supreme Court decided that Best Western was a franchisor and had to comply with the appropriate laws and regulations.

=== Best Western GB ===
Best Western GB began in 1978 when Interchange Hotels of the United Kingdom consisting of independent hoteliers from key locations in the UK elected to trade under the brand name Best Western United Kingdom, effectively an affiliate of Best Western International in the US. Now there are over 260 Best Western hotels within Great Britain.

=== Best Western Australia and New Zealand ===
In 1981, Homestead Motor Inns of Australia affiliated with Best Western. This move put &#x27;International&#x27; after the Best Western name. The company has since been known as Best Western International.

In early 2007 Best Western Australia took over the rights to operate Best Western properties in New Zealand from the previous company, the Motel Federation of New Zealand. This was a bold but beneficial move for the brand as it made way for better quality properties to be brought into the brand. Currently, Best Western Australia has 205 properties in the group (11 in New Zealand and 194 in Australia).

=== Best Western Myanmar (Burma) ===
On 21 May 2013 Best Western International announced that it will take over management of the Green Hill Hotel in Yangon, Myanmar. The acquisition gave the Best Western brand a place presence in Myanmar (Burma) as its first hotel establishment in the country.

== Corporate design ==

As of August 2023, BWH Hotels has 19 brands and logos. Since 1948 the Best Western logo has had approximately 13 modification to the main brand logo, with the last brand logo change made in 2015. In 2010 Best Western divided the brand into 3 descriptors. 

The logo stayed the same, but the descriptors of Plus and Premier were added, and all hotels were either a Best Western, Best Western Plus, or Best Western Premier. In 2015, a complete overhaul of the Best Western logo resulted in a very different logo from the previous years, with the most notable change being the removal of the crown which had been a part of the logo since 1962. 

Since 2014 the brand has created 12 additional brands, for a total of 15 brands with distinctive logos. The Best Western website has a picture of all of their past logos in their &quot;timeline and story&quot; section. Best Western also owns (acquired in February 2019) the WorldHotels Collection which includes 4 additional brands, whose logos are all the same, except for the addition of the distinguishing descriptors of Luxury, Elite, Distinctive, and Crafted.

<doc id="725720" wikidata="Q1282674" url="?curid=725720" title="Eddie and the Hot Rods">
<text>Eddie and the Hot Rods are a pub rock band from Essex founded in 1975. They are best known for their 1977 UK top ten hit &quot;Do Anything You Wanna Do&quot;, released under the shortened name Rods. The group broke up in 1985, but reformed in 1996. Singer Barrie Masters was the only constant member until his death in 2019. The band continued to tour, fronted by their former bassist, Ian &#x27;Dipster&#x27; Dean.

==History==
===Formation===
The band was formed in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, England, during 1975 by guitarist Dave Higgs (who had previously played in the Fix with Lee Brilleaux), with drummer Steve Nicol, bassist Rob Steele, and singer Barrie Masters (born in Rochford, Essex; 4 May 1956 – 2 October 2019).

Before rising to semi-stardom in 1977, the Hot Rods underwent several changes in personnel: one of the first members to leave the band was &quot;Eddie&quot; himself, which was a dummy that featured prominently in the Hot Rods&#x27; early gigs and was discarded as the joke had worn thin. Otherwise, the band consisted of Barrie Masters on vocals, Pete Wall and Dave Higgs on guitar, Rob Steele on bass and Steve Nicol on drums. Ed Hollis (brother of Talk Talk&#x27;s Mark Hollis) became their manager.

In May 1975, after building a live reputation, they secured a Saturday-night residency at The Kensington in London. This was followed in October by a joint residency with the 101ers at The Nashville, playing alternate headline sets. In November, after positive press reviews of their live shows, they were signed by Island Records.

===Commercial success===
By 1976, Lew Lewis (harmonica) and Paul Gray (bass) had replaced Wall and Steele. Lewis&#x27;s tenure in the group lasted for the release of their first two singles before he too left. With this new line-up, the Hot Rods played a set at London&#x27;s famous Marquee Club – their opening act was the Sex Pistols which descended into chaos with the Pistols smashing the Hot Rods&#x27; gear; The Pistols&#x27; support slot earned them their first music press review, in the NME, with no mention of the headlining Hot Rods at all. By way of revenge, the Hot Rods claimed in the next week&#x27;s edition of the NME to have &quot;sacked&quot; the Pistols from an upcoming tour, which the NME pithily described as &quot;what you get for mixin(g) with &quot;real&quot; punks.&quot; During a residency at the club in the summer of 1976 they duelled for alternate weeks with AC/DC, to see who could cram more bodies into the Marquee during one of the hottest summers on record. They first appeared in the UK Singles Chart the end of that year with the &quot;Live at the Marquee&quot; EP and the single &quot;Teenage Depression&quot;, an energetic rock and roll song.

After the release of the &quot;Teenage Depression&quot; album, which marked their debut appearance in the UK Albums Chart, they recorded another EP called &quot;Live – At the Sound of Speed&quot;. During the gig from which this EP was recorded, Graeme Douglas (formerly of the Kursaal Flyers) joined the band onstage and jammed along adding extra lead lines. Afterwards his membership of the band was made permanent, and they set about writing and recording for their second album. The live recording of the &quot;Sound of Speed&quot; EP featured Douglas on only one track, he therefore set about recording additional lead guitar overdubs in the studio, though to keep in with the essence of a live release, he was only given one attempt at recording each song.

With the addition of Douglas, the band was moved in a more radio-friendly direction. Their biggest hit came with the Douglas/Hollis collaboration &quot;Do Anything You Wanna Do&quot; in the summer of 1977, under their shorter, snappier name, the Rods. This single made the British Top 10 (number 9 in August 1977) and also proved popular with the then predominant punk audience, as did that year&#x27;s album &quot;Life on the Line&quot;. They appeared at the Reading Festival held in August 1977 and also in that year the Hot Rods toured the United States with the Ramones and Talking Heads. In late 1977 they released a one-off collaboration with MC5 singer Rob Tyner as &#x27;Rob Tyner &amp; the Hot Rods&#x27;. When it came to recording a follow-up album, the band tried to recapture the success of &quot;Do Anything You Wanna Do&quot;, but to no avail. The album, &quot;Life on the Line&quot;, hit further problems with CBS Records still having contractual claim over Douglas, leading to his picture being removed from the LP sleeve for some releases. In 1978 the band toured in Canada.

In early 1979, they released a further album with Douglas, entitled &quot;Thriller&quot;, recorded at Abbey Road Studio, which featured a fuller studio sound and used more studio effects. Due to disappointing sales, they found themselves dropped by Island in 1979, and in May that year were rumoured to be on the verge of splitting, with Gray touring with the Members and Masters and Nicol playing in the band Plus Support. They signed to EMI in August 1979, releasing a further album in 1981, &quot;Fish&#x27;n&#x27;Chips&quot; with new bass player T.C. (Tony Cranney), but disbanded in 1981.

===Reformations===
At this point, Gray and Douglas had already left the band, the former joining the Damned. Masters teamed up with the Inmates. Ed Hollis went on to work with some of the best known acts of the punk era including the Damned, Elvis Costello, and Stiff Little Fingers. Nicol joined One the Juggler.

Masters and Nicol re-formed the Hot Rods in 1984, with T.C. (Tony Cranney) bassplayer from the &quot;Fish and Chips&quot; album and new guitarist Warren Kennedy. This line-up recorded the single &quot;Fought for You&quot;. Tony Cranney was later replaced By Russ Strutter for the live mini-LP &quot;One Story Town&quot;, before the band split again in 1985. Tex Axile, who had briefly been a member in this era, went on to join Transvision Vamp.

In 1992 the &#x27;classic&#x27; line-up (Masters, Nicol, Higgs, and Gray) re-grouped for a European tour. Higgs left after the tour, but the band carried on with Steve Walwyn of Dr. Feelgood replacing him. Another Feelgood member, Gordon Russell was briefly a member, soon replaced by Mick Rodgers, a former member of Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band. In 1994 they recorded the album &quot;Gasoline Days&quot;, released in 1996 by Japanese label Creative Man. Several line-up changes followed, with members including Madman Keyo and Jess Phillips.

The new millennium saw a new line-up, still led by Masters but now comprising Simon Bowley on drums (nephew of original drummer Steve Nicol), Dipster Dean on bass and Gary Loker on guitar. In 2001, after an 80 date UK &#x27;Naughty Rhythms&#x27; Tour (with Dr Feelgood, the Hamsters and John Otway) they were joined by Richard Holgarth (Otway) on guitar and shortly afterwards, Loker left the band.

In 2005, they recorded &quot;Better Late than Never&quot; in preparation for a 30th anniversary tour and then expanded to a five piece band again with the addition of Chris Taylor in 2006 for the recording of the album &quot;Been There, Done That&quot;. This is the line-up that has since performed as Eddie and the Hot Rods.

Dave Higgs died in December 2013.

In early 2018, the band announced they would soon retire from headline tours. The band toured the UK in March 2019 opening for Stiff Little Fingers. Touring bass player for the March 2019 tour was Adam Smith of Newtown Neurotics.

A one-off celebration gig &#x27;Done Everything We Wanna Do&#x27; took place at o2 Academy, Islington on 13 April 2019. which featured appearances from past members (Lew Lewis, Paul Gray, Steve Nicol, Graeme Douglas, Warren Kennedy, Chris Taylor, Tony Cranney), current members (Richard Holgarth, Simon Bowley, Dipster) and special guests Captain Sensible (The Damned), Leigh Heggarty (Ruts DC), Duncan Reid (The Boys), Dennis Greaves and Mark Feltham (Nine Below Zero) and JC Carroll (The Members) all joining frontman Barrie Masters.

Masters was found dead in his home on 1 October 2019, at the age of 63, having taken various intoxicants. A later inquest determined that his death was drug-related.

Having already announced that Barrie would be retiring at the end of the year due to health concerns and, after an enforced Covid pandemic break throughout 2020, the band decided to return to the stage in 2021 with long time bassist Ian &#x27;Dipster&#x27; Dean taking over the vocal duties. Mic Stoner (Chords UK) replaced him on bass guitar and they undertook on a UK tour alongside Nine Below Zero.

===Guardians of the Legacy===
On 27 March 2022, they could be seen performing their new single &quot;Guardians of the Legacy&quot; on the Talking Pictures TV broadcast of &quot;The Heritage Chart Show with Mike Read&quot;. &quot;Guardians of the Legacy&quot; is the title track from an album issued on the anniversary of Masters&#x27; death in October 2022.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s early repertoire consisted of covers of 1960s R&amp;B songs and original songs inspired by the likes of Dr. Feelgood. Known for their energy on stage, they attracted a younger audience than many pub rock bands. Although often categorised as one of the founding fathers of the punk era, they were simply interested in playing loud, fast, in-your-face rock and roll. The energy and attitude certainly endeared them to punks and Joe Strummer stated that when he read about the band in a listings magazine it was the first time he had seen the word &#x27;punk&#x27; used to describe a band. Their 1977 tour of the US with the Ramones and Talking Heads was billed as a punk rock tour, and their 1977 concert in Windsor, Ontario, was billed as &quot;Windsor&#x27;s First Punk Rock Concert&quot;. They were overtaken by punk rock bands, however, and were soon considered to be outside the genre.

<text>The fountain is a juggling pattern that is the method most often used for juggling an even number of objects. In a fountain, each hand juggles separately, and the objects are not thrown between the hands, thus the number of balls is always even since any number of balls in one hand is doubled by the same number in the other hand. To illustrate this, it can be seen that in the most common fountain pattern where four balls are juggled, each hand juggles two balls independently. As Crego states &quot;In the fountain pattern, each hand throws balls straight up into the air and each ball is caught in the same hand that throws it.&quot;

A fountain can be synchronous or asynchronous. In a synchronous fountain, both hands throw at the same time, while in an asynchronous fountain, the hands alternate throws. &quot;The fountain pattern...can be stably performed in two ways...one can perform the fountain with different frequencies for the two hands, but that coordination is difficult because of the tendency of the limbs to synchronize.&quot; The fountain is juggled in a circular fashion, distinguishing it from columns. The circular method means that the balls juggled travel in a circle-like motion with the jugglers hands throwing the ball from a point close to their body centre line and catching the ball further away from their body centre line. This circular motion is called &#x27;outside circles&#x27; and is the fountain pattern shown in the animation. This circle method can be reversed to create an &#x27;inside circle&#x27; pattern whereby throws are from a position away from the body midline and catches are closer to the body midline. In the columns method the balls all travel vertically up and down in their own &#x27;column&#x27;, and are caught from where they are thrown.

==Other fountain patterns==

4 is the asynchronous asymmetrical fountain. (4,4) is the synchronous fountain. (4,4)(4,0) is a synchronous fountain with one ball missing (two in one, one in the other).

Wimpy, (4x,4x), is a crossing version of the synchronous fountain.

<text>18 Melpomene is a large, bright main-belt asteroid that was discovered by J. R. Hind on 24 June 1852, and named after Melpomenē, the Muse of tragedy in Greek mythology. Its historical symbol was a dagger over a star; it is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CECB 𜻋 ().

Melpomene is classified as an S-type asteroid and is composed of silicates and metals. This asteroid is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with a period of and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.22. The orbital plane is tilted at an angle of 10.1° to the plane of the ecliptic.

Melpomene occulted the star SAO 114159 on 11 December 1978. A possible Melpomenean satellite with a diameter at least 37 km was detected. The satellite candidate received a provisional designation S/1978 (18) 1. In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty. Melpomene was observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993. It was able to resolve the asteroid&#x27;s slightly elongated shape, but no satellites were detected.

Melpomene has been studied by radar. Photometric observations during 2012 provided a rotation period of with a brightness variation of in magnitude, which is consistent with previous studies. It has a mean diameter of .

Melpomene can reach an apparent magnitude of +7.9 at a favorable opposition near perihelion, such as occurred in September 2002 when it was from Earth.

<text>Stora Karlsö is a small Swedish island in the Baltic Sea, situated about west of the island of Gotland and part of Eksta socken.

== Environment==
Stora Karlsö has an area of about . It is mainly a limestone plateau, up to in height, bordered by steep cliffs along the shore. It is mostly covered with alvar. It is a nature reserve, the second oldest in the world after Yellowstone National Park.

===Flora and fauna===
The island is mostly known for its rich flora and birdlife. There are many juniper bushes and some small groves of deciduous trees. In spring, there is an extraordinary number of orchids, mostly elder-flowered orchid and early purple orchid. There are also several very rare plants for Sweden such as &quot;Adonis vernalis&quot;, &quot;Lactuca quercina&quot; (called &quot;Karlsösallat&quot; in Swedish), hart&#x27;s-tongue fern and &quot;Corydalis gotlandica&quot; (the only endemic plant of Gotland).

Stora Karlsö also has large colonies of common guillemots (about 15,700 breeding pairs) and razorbills (12,000 pairs, in 2014–2015). Along with neighbouring Lilla Karlsö, it has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

== History ==
There is evidence that Stora Karlsö has been inhabited since the Stone Age. During the Middle Ages there was a marble quarry, which gave the material for many of Gotland&#x27;s churches. The island is a nature reserve, and after Yellowstone National Park is the oldest established protected nature area in the world. From May to August there are tour boats from the village Klintehamn.

The Stora Karlsö Lighthouse was built in 1887. A house for the lighthouse keeper was added in the 1930s, which resulted in the island getting its first permanent residents in modern times. Since 1974, the lighthouse is automated and there are no permanent residents on the island. The lighthouse and the surrounded buildings are now listed.

<text>19 Fortuna is one of the largest main-belt asteroids. It has a composition similar to 1 Ceres: a darkly colored surface that is heavily space-weathered with the composition of primitive organic compounds, including tholins.

Fortuna is 225 km in diameter and has one of the darkest known geometric albedos for an asteroid over 150 km in diameter. Its albedo has been measured at 0.028 and 0.037. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration.

The Hubble Space Telescope observed Fortuna in 1993. It was resolved with an apparent diameter of 0.20 arcseconds (4.5 pixels in the Planetary Camera) and its shape was found to be nearly spherical. Satellites were searched for but none were detected.

Stellar occultations by Fortuna have been observed several times. Fortuna has been studied by radar.

It was discovered by J. R. Hind on 22 August 1852, and named after Fortuna, the Roman goddess of luck. Its historical symbol was a star over Fortune&#x27;s wheel; it is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CECC 𜻌 ().

Fortuna has been perturbed by the 80 km 135 Hertha and was initially estimated by Baer to have a mass of 1.08 kg. A more recent estimate by Baer suggests it has a mass of 1.27 kg.

On 21 December 2012, Fortuna (~200 km) harmlessly passed within 6.5 Gm of asteroid 687 Tinette.

<text>An oval barrow is the name given by archaeologists to a type of prehistoric burial tumulus of roughly oval shape.

In the British mid to late Neolithic and early Bronze Age, oval barrows may indicate a transition between earlier long barrows with multiple burials and the later, more individual round barrows. 

Judging from those sited in or near the Thames Valley, there is much doubt as to how oval barrows are related to the burials found within them and funerary practices, because there can be a long gap of many years between an original burial and the construction of the barrow.

== Examples in England ==

=== Buckinghamshire ===

==== Whiteleaf Hill ====

There is a neolithic oval barrow near the top of Whiteleaf Hill, Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire (National Grid: SP 822040), which was first excavated by Sir Lindsay Scott between 1934 and 1939 and re-excavated from 2002 to 2006 by Oxford Archaeology (assisted by the Princes Risborough Countryside Group). The mound is roughly oval, but indented on the north-eastern side, making it somewhat kidney-shaped. The barrow held only one burial and radio-carbon dating has shown that the death, the burial and the building of the mound probably all took place within the period 3,750-3,100 B.C., but at different times within that period. The remains appeared to have been placed between two large vertical posts, 1.2 metres apart. Pottery shards and animal bones were found at the core of the mound and the excavators suggest that these came from ceremonial feasting when the mound was built.

==== Dorney Reach ====

This is a mid-neolithic barrow dated to the approximate period 3300–2800 BC. Previously known only from a cropmark, magnetometry and resistivity surveys have produced more detailed information about this unexcavated site, which is on level ground on the flood plain of the River Thames at SU 9170 7935, 250 metres from the river. They reveal an oval ditch with external dimensions of about 20 by 12.5 metres. The axis lies NNE-SSW. Indications of two pits at the centre may represent a split-timber mortuary structure, as was found at Whiteleaf.

==== Marsh Lane East (site 2) ====

It is believed that this was originally a neolithic oval barrow, but it was re-cut in the Bronze Age, so that little of the original barrow remains.

<doc id="725747" wikidata="Q5091034" url="?curid=725747" title="Chenango Canal">
<text>The Chenango Canal was a towpath canal in central New York in the United States which linked the Susquehanna River to the Erie Canal. Built and operated in the mid-19th century, it was 97 miles long and for much of its course followed the Chenango River, along New York State Route 12 from Binghamton on the south end to Utica on the north. It operated from 1834 to 1878 and provided a significant link in the water transportation system of the northeastern U.S. until supplanted by the region&#x27;s developing railroad network.

==Construction==

The canal was first proposed in the New York Legislature in 1824 during the construction of the Erie Canal, prompted by lobbying from local leaders in the Chenango Valley. It was authorized by the legislature in 1833 and completed in October 1836 at a total cost of $2,500,000—approximately twice the original appropriation. In 1833 a grand ball was held in Oxford, New York, which feted the canal&#x27;s approval. The great American civil engineer John B. Jervis was appointed Chief Engineer of the project and helped in its design. This was an era of extensive canal building in the United States, following the English model, in order to provide a major transportation network for the eastern United States.

The excavation began in 1834 and was largely done by Irish and Scottish immigrant laborers, digging by hand, using pick and shovel, chipping through rock and wading through marsh. They were paid $11 per month, which was three times a common laborer&#x27;s wages at the time. Skilled workers came from the completed Erie Canal project and brought new inventions, such as an ingenious stump-puller, which used oxen or mules for animal power. Work camps for the laborers were established along the route and as many as 500 men stayed in each camp. The canal opened in October, 1836, and was billed as the &quot;best-built canal in the state&quot;.

The Chenango Canal was 42 feet wide at the top and 26 feet wide at the bottom and averaged 4 feet deep. It had 116 locks, 11 lock houses, 12 dams, 19 aqueducts, 52 culverts, 56 road bridges, 106 farm bridges, 53 feeder bridges, and 21 waste weirs. The Chenango was unique in that it was the first reservoir-fed canal in the U.S. In this design, reservoirs were created and feeder canals were dug to bring water to the summit level of the canal. This had been done previously in Europe, but had not been tried in the US. This project had to succeed by getting almost 23 miles of waterway up an incline with a 706&#x27; elevation, to the summit level in Bouckville, and back down a descent of 303&#x27; to the Susquehanna river in Binghamton. At a time when there was only one engineering school in the country (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ((1824)), and hydrology was not yet a scientific discipline, Jervis and his team were able to design a complex waterway that was considered the best of its day.

== System ==

The main artery Erie Canal was built between 1817 and 1825 and provided the key link in a water highway to what would become the Midwestern United States, connecting to the Great Lakes at Buffalo. It connected the Great Lakes to the Hudson River and then to the port of New York City. The Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York&#x27;s unique topography which provided that area with the only break in the Appalachian range—allowing for east-west navigation from the Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes. The canal system gave New York State a competitive advantage, helped New York City develop as an international trade center, and allowed Buffalo to grow from just 2,000 settlers in 1820 to over 18,000 people by 1840. The port of New York became essentially the Atlantic home port for all of the Great Lakes states. It was because of this vital and critical connection that New York State became known as the Empire State.

The Erie Canal represented the first major water-works project in the United States. It proved the practicality of large-scale water diversions without disrupting the local environment. The canal connected the waters of Lake Erie to the tidewater of New York harbor in a multi-level route that followed the local terrain and was fed by local water sources. All of the New York branch canals would follow this model. With the Erie, as with all of the branch canals, water flow was required for several purposes: filling the canal at the beginning of each spring season; water for lockage, i.e., water loss from higher to lower levels; water loss by seepage through the berm and towpath banks and water diverted for industrial power usage. Consequently, flooding and droughts were perennial problems for all of the New York canals.

The Chenango Canal operated from 1834 to 1878, from April to November each year. The opening of the canal cut the shipping time from Binghamton to Albany from nine days to four days, and reduced the cost of shipping goods dramatically. It was intended to connect Binghamton and surrounding communities, by water route, to the port of New York City and to the Great Lakes States.

The northern terminus of the Chenango Canal was in Utica at an entry lock near present-day N. Genesee Street and the Erie Canal; the southern terminus was in Binghamton at a turning basin near present-day State and Susquehanna Streets. State Street in Binghamton was built on the path of the canal in 1872. The village of Port Dickinson and the hamlets of Port Crane and Pecksport owe their origins and names to being stops on the route. With the coming of the Chenango Canal, Port Crane, being located on the line of this waterway, developed rapidly, with stores, hotels, boat yards and repair and dry docks being built in that village. For some time beginning in 1837, the canal afforded shipping facilities to these and other such isolated areas, which were gradually improved. Between 1840 and 1865, for example, the village of Port Crane reached the height of its prosperity. Overall, the construction of the canal led to a widespread manufacturing and building boom in the Chenango Valley.

A western extension, commonly known as the Extension Canal, was begun in 1840. The Extension continued west along the south side of the Susquehanna River, as far as Vestal. Officially named the Chenango Canal Extension, it was for the purpose of &quot;making connection with the Pennsylvania canal system, and thus to complete a route to the vast coal fields in that state, the New York Legislature, on April 18, 1838, passed an act (chapter 292) directing the canal commissioners to cause a survey to be made from the termination of the Chenango canal at Binghamton, along the valley of the Susquehanna, to the State line near Tioga Point, at the termination of the North Branch canal of Pennsylvania, and to cause an estimate of the cost of this continuation to be made.&quot; Also it would connect with western New York through the Junction and Chemung canals, Seneca lake, and the Cayuga and Seneca and the Erie canals.

In the original plan, the Chenango Canal was supposed to connect the Erie Canal with the Pennsylvania Canal. But the connecting canals in the southern part of the state and in northern Pennsylvania were never fully completed nor totally operational. One section would fall into disrepair before the rest of the line was completed. Also, this canal
was begun at the close of the canal era, and the era ended before the line could be completed.

The extension was not the only segment with operational problems. The Chenango Canal had its problems, as well. Most significantly, the Chenango Co. had difficulty performing its regular maintenance due to the often prohibitively high repair costs. As with most canal lines in the East, they began operation carrying too much debt. If the company did not show a wide enough margin from the user fees during the season, they would end the year at a deficit. Also, as with many similar canals, the Chenango&#x27;s greatest error was that they initially installed a system using wooden locks. With New York&#x27;s frigid winters and freeze-thaw cycles, the wood never held up for very long. As soon as one section had been repaired, another would give out, and it usually took more time and money than was available before they were all in operation. The original structures were incrementally all rebuilt. Ultimately and at great cost, the process culminated in the construction of stone locks.

==Operation==

The competition kept the freight rates low. Before the canal was built, it took between 9 and 13 days to ship goods by wagon from Binghamton to Albany, for a cost of $1.25 per 100 pounds. A canal boat made the trip in less than four days and cost $ .25 per 100 pounds. Records also show an example of a fare on a packet line that ran between Norwich and Binghamton. The fare was $1.50 per person, departing at 6 am, arriving sometime between 6 and 8 pm.

Many classes of boats frequented the Chenango Canal and included packet boats, scows, lakers and bullheadsthe name for the freight barges, which were the most common boats seen. The bullhead was so named because of its blunt and rounded bow. They were about 14 feet wide and 75 feet long and were sometimes loaded so heavily that they would periodically drag along the bottom of the canal. The packet boats and barges were drawn at an average speed of four miles an hour by horse or mule teams on the towpath. The passenger boats were usually pulled by horses, which were changed every ten miles. The freight barges were pulled by mules, which were changed every four to six hours. Each barge had two cabins: one at the bow to stable the animals, usually horses or mules, that pulled the boat, and one at the stern which served as a living quarters for the captain and crew, and sometimes a whole family. The packet boats bore names like &quot;The Madison of Solsville&quot;, with Captain Bishop, or &quot;Fair Play&quot;, with Captain Van Slyck, and were manned by a minimum crew of three. Each boat needed a driver walking on the towpath controlling the animals, a bowsman controlling the movement and direction of the bow and a steersman on the aft deck. The passengers were seated in chairs on the top deck. When the boat would near a town, the crewmen shouted: &quot;Low bridge!&quot; and everyone would retreat to the lower deck to avoid being swept overboard by a bridge.

==Impact==

The first packet boat, &quot;The Dove of Solsville&quot;, arrived in Binghamton from Utica May 6, 1837, officially opening the canal, and was quickly followed by new development along the canal&#x27;s route. The area benefited from the arrival of new settlers, new and needed merchandise and the provision of a means of shipping finished goods and product in and out of the local areas. Mills and factories sprang up along the southern end of the canal, while stores and hotels arose all along the retail corridor. Numerous and varied supporting businesses also flourished, including taverns, inns and boat yards- for building and repair. Farmers now had an efficient, affordable and dependable means of transportation enabling them to sell their perishable milk production to butter and cheese factories; the factories could readily ship their product to market. Apple cider and cider vinegar were shipped from &quot;Mott&#x27;s&quot;, at what is now the Bouckville Mill. Lumber mills had affordable availability of their resources and access to their markets. In a few instances, however, mills were forced to cease operation. Such was the case with Madison&#x27;s Solsville Mills, whose water supply from Oriskany Creek was diverted away to be used for the supply of the canal.

The Chenango also allowed for efficient, comfortable and relatively fast passenger transportation. New residents arrived from Utica, most having come in through New York&#x27;s port. The canal&#x27;s construction laborers themselves were largely immigrants who stayed and settled in the area after the construction was completed. In 1861, the canal transported 1000 soldiers of the 114th Regiment from Norwich to Utica, in a flotilla of 10 packet boats. This was the first leg of their journey southward to serve in the Union Army during the war. Each town through which they passed met them with flags, fanfare and patriotic fervor. A watercolor painting celebrating that event hangs today in the Chenango Museum in Norwich.

The canal itself was also utilized for recreation. In the summer months it supported swimming, boating and fishing. In the winter months, after the surface froze over, ice skating and even horse racing became favorite pastimes.

Before the Chenango Canal was built, much of the Southern Tier and Central New York was still considered to be frontier. The people there lived as pioneers everywhere lived, a rugged and rustic existence, without the prosperity and possessions enjoyed by much of the rest of the state. The people petitioned for a canal corridor so that they could benefit from such things as efficient clean-burning coal, which had to be shipped from Pennsylvania. Previously people had heated only with wood. After the Chenango, trade increased between New York City, Albany and the Southern Tier. Merchants could market heavier items such as manufactured furniture and the coveted coal-burning stoves. With the canal&#x27;s opening, living standards would generally improve.

The canal was also a source of local employment. It is believed that Phillip Armour, the millionaire meat packer from Madison County, had first worked as a mule driver walking the Chenango Canal. The countless miles must have built his legs and tenacity, for he eventually quit and walked across the United States. He went to work the gold fields of California. He gradually earned a fortune and ultimately became a shipping magnate- the system he probably learned from his experience on the Chenango. Another driver was Nuel Stever. He was a veteran canal boatman who in 1927, at the age of 76, spoke of his colorful memories living on a Chenango Canal packet boat. His interview was published in &quot;The Norwich Sun&quot;:

When I was five, I began driving canal boat teams on the towpath pulling the boats. Such work was common to boys of that age. I can remember driving a team hour after hour up the towpath for 20 miles when I was five. When I was tired, I&#x27;d rest part of my weight on the towrope; it seemed to rest me. My father was at the helm. But when I became 10, I took my turn at the helm and a younger brother drove the teams. Whole families lived on the canal boats. I was the oldest of 21 children. We&#x27;d go to Oswego to load lumber for Bartlett&#x27;s Mill in Binghamton. Hamilton was the highest point and where the canal froze up first in the fall. Often in the fall as many as 82 boats loaded with lumber would be tied up. When the freeze was just beginning, Bartlett would bring up several teams, hitch them to a bunch of stumps and drag through the canal to break the ice so boats could get lumber to his mill. Canalling was a varied business. For instance, we&#x27;d take a lot of firkins and get them filled along the way with butter for the merchants. We&#x27;d boat grain up to the big stills at Hamilton, Pecksport, Bouckville and Solsville and bring back loads of whiskey which the merchants sold or shipped away. We only did the boating. Whiskey then sold for 25 cents a gallon. It was a busy canal in those days. Three years before the canal closed, about 50 years ago (from 1927), 120 boats carried coal.

==Closing==

Opened in 1834, Chenango Canal was a necessary link in the interconnecting transportation system in New York, for which the need was well-recognized at that time. Canals had been employed successfully in England to enable the Industrial Revolution. The extraordinary success of the Bridgewater Canal in North West England, completed in 1761, began an era of canal building in that country. The U.S., intent on its own development, would follow suit. However, the advent of the Chenango Canal, after having been tied up in the New York Legislature for 19 years, came late in the canal era. By the time of its construction, this type of canal and its technology was already becoming obsolete. The invention of the steam locomotive had already occurred in England in 1811, and the development of a railway system had begun in England by the mid-1820s. The success of those technologies and systems there would allow them to supplant the artificial water-route systems everywhere. The railroads were more durable, more flexible, more efficient, more cost-effective and most importantly- faster than the canals.

In 1848, the trains finally arrived in Binghamton in the form of the Erie Railroad. The new technology had caught up with the Chenango and the arrival of the &#x27;iron horse&#x27; spelled the eventual end for the canal. Over the next two decades the Binghamton area developed into a transportation hub. Along with the canal, the area was now being served by several railroad lines. After the Civil War, railroad expansion would come to include the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, the New York, Ontario and Western and the Delaware and Hudson in the Chenango and Susquehanna Valleys. This ultimately rendered the canal obsolete. In a sadly ironic twist, it was the canal that carried the engines for the trains, the tools and the railroad men. It was the canal&#x27;s own barges that carried the rails for the tracks that would replace them. It is also noteworthy that the D&amp;H began its existence as a canal company.

Despite its success in augmenting the economic development of the Southern Tier and Central New York, the Chenango Canal itself had never been a financial success. After years of competition and decline and continual financial loss, by a vote of the state legislature the Chenango Canal was closed in 1878– just four decades and four years after it was opened. The land and assets were broken up and gradually sold, mostly at auction. Some of the properties were sold to private interests, some were deeded to municipal areas and others were held by the state. Much of the channel was subsequently filled in, and frequently paved over, particularly within the cities and the more populated areas. But some of the more isolated stretches of the canal were simply closed and abandoned.

While most of the larger towns, and all of the state, benefited from the triumph of the railroads, many of the smaller villages and hamlets did not. For practically every small settlement that was located on the line of the canal, but which was missed by the railroad, when the canal departed prosperity went with it. Two good illustrations of this are the once-prospering villages of Port Crane and Pecksport, where very little of either one is left today.

After 1900, a surviving stretch of the then-closed canal gained notoriety owing to its use to transport contraband through the town of Hamilton. Tobacco, alcohol (during Prohibition), and marijuana were transported along the canal. In order to control this traffic, NY State officials decided to build a checkpoint along its route. Surprisingly, over five million dollars worth of illegal goods were confiscated, from 1900 until about 1930, in what would become one of the most famous water-borne transportation enforcements of that time. Remnants of the stockade which was built can still be seen in the back rooms of the buildings housing the &quot;Flour &amp; Salt Cafe&quot; at 37 Lebanon Street as of 2023, and also the associated stockade on the corner of Pine Street and W. Kendrick Avenue in Hamilton. The Pine Street building was later converted into an asylum.

==Today==
In many places the canal path became the roadbed for streets, and its path can be traced by the roads which replaced it. These include Binghamton&#x27;s State Street and Chenango Street, NY Route 5, NY Route 8, NY Route 12 and NY Route 12B. In Utica the canal bed follows next to or underneath NY Route 12B/12, and entered the Erie Canal west of State Street. Portions of the old channel, stone aqueducts, locks, and other structures still remain in place along its route, and are visible in several locations. These include: between Bouckville and Solsville; near Hamilton, NY; north of North Fenton and west of County Road 32; north of Sherburne, west of NY Route 12B, and in the village of Oxford, both on Canal St and the remains of a harbor on North Washington. The only place left with moving water is an area between Woodman&#x27;s Pond, near the now extinct Pecksport and the aqueduct on Canal Road, just after Bouckville, which was the summit level on the canal. Most of these canal remnants as well as much of the original path are visible or discernible using Google Earth.
The Chenango Canal bed continues to exist in Utica alongside the arterial for a half mile just east of the arterial and south of the Burrstone Road overpass. The waters of Nail Creek flow through this section of the canal. The stonework of a lock remains in good shape and can be seen here. The tow path, however, is currently overgrown with brush.

Chenango Canal Summit Level is a national historic district located in the vicinity of Bouckville in Madison County, New York, United States. The district contains three contributing structures. It is a five-mile segment of the Chenango Canal constructed between 1834 and 1836. The five mile summit portion is watered, owned and operated by the New York State Canal Corporation as part of the feeder system for the Erie (Barge) Canal about 30 miles north. The contributing structures are the canal prism and adjacent tow path, the remaining portions of the aqueduct that carried the Chenango over the Oriskany Creek, and a pair of stone bridge abutments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

Currently, the community in the Madison area is working to develop a trail along the original towpath. They hope to collect historical artifacts for public display and establish what is left of the Chenango Canal in that area as a Madison County park. The Chenango Canal Corridor Connections trail project is a major project with the vision to link various trails along the general canal and O&amp;W rail corridors from Utica to Binghamton. Calling it the Chenango Connections Corridor, the area&#x27;s citizens are now working in conjunction with the NYS Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation; the NYS Canal Corporation; and Parks &amp; Trails New York staff, as part of the HTHP program, to shape a vision and implementation plan for the corridor that spans three counties and multiple villages and towns.

The Chenango Canal Prism and Lock 107 at Chenango Forks in Broome County, New York was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

<text>The original Plymouth Duster is a semi-fastback two-door coupe version of the compact-sized Plymouth Valiant automobile that was marketed by Plymouth in the U.S. from 1970 to 1976 model years.

==History==
The Duster coupe provided the compact-sized Plymouth Valiant with a sporty body style to attract customers. The car was a $15 million effort to update the Valiant for the 1970 model year. The Valiant badge appeared only on the first model year Dusters, and continued to be used on all the companion 4-door sedan and 2-door Valiant Scamp hardtop models. The Duster was built on the Valiant platform and shared the same front end sheet metal, but featured a different design from the cowl back.

The Duster was also positioned to compete with Ford&#x27;s slightly smaller semi-fastback Maverick compact car and the AMC Hornet that were both also introduced in 1970, and the slightly larger semi-fastback Chevrolet Nova whose design was introduced in 1968. While the Maverick, Hornet, and Nova were offered in a 4-door sedan body style, the Duster nameplate was used only for the 2-door coupe. The Duster was also marketed as an alternative to the original Volkswagen Beetle, as well as the new class of domestic subcompact cars such as the Chevrolet Vega.

Numerous trim and option package variants of the Duster were offered with names that included Feather Duster, Gold Duster, Silver Duster, Space Duster, Duster Twister, Duster 340, and Duster 360. These marketing variations of the basic Duster design targeted customers seeking economy, cargo capacity, and/or performance.

After failed negotiations with Warner Brothers for use of the Tasmanian Devil cartoon, the Duster&#x27;s &quot;twister&quot; logo and font logo was created by Chrysler&#x27;s Thomas Bertsch (1952–1987). Bertsch was the director of the interior styling and design studio for much of his career. Many corresponding graphics were used for different trim packages over the years.

==Model years==
===1970===
The Plymouth Duster introduced in late-1969 for the 1970 model year was all Valiant from the cowl forward, but the rest of the car&#x27;s sheet metal, save door skins, was completely different. The design incorporated a semi-fastback roof and a special rear valance having no bezels. The door glass was operated by a new regulator mechanism, required to fit the much more radical tumblehome (reduced side glass radius), and the windshield was more steeply raked. For 1970 only, a small Valiant badge went on the front fenders just above the Duster badge.

The 1970 Duster was available in two models – the standard Duster and a performance-oriented Duster 340. Engine options were and versions of Chrysler&#x27;s Slant Six, as well as the and LA-series V8s.

At midyear, a Gold Duster trim package was added. The Gold Duster package came with gold badging, gold stripes on the sides and rear, wall-to-wall carpeting, pleated, all-vinyl seats, whitewalls, wheel covers, a deluxe insulation package, and a canopy vinyl roof. The Gold Duster was offered through 1975 of which 24,817 were equipped with the 318 engine.

===1971===

The Duster was a success for Plymouth, so much so that in 1971 Dodge requested and received their own version, the Demon. In response, Plymouth was given a version of the Dodge Dart Swinger 2-door hardtop named the Plymouth Valiant Scamp.

For 1971, only small changes were made to the Duster. The &quot;Valiant&quot; fender badges and &quot;Plymouth&quot; grille logotype were deleted. A new trim package was released, called the Duster Twister. The Twister package presented the appearance of the Duster 340, but came only with the base I6 or 318 V8. The Twister&#x27;s appearance package included special side stripes that mimicked the Duster 340 Wedge stripes, a matte-black hood, and the 340&#x27;s special shark-tooth grille. A nonfunctional dual hood scoop and rear spoiler appearance package were available, as were high-back bucket seats and dual exhaust.

A new electronic &quot;breakerless&quot; ignition became optional on the 340 V8 late in the 1971 model year. In 1971, 186,478 Plymouth Dusters were built, with 12,886 equipped with the higher horsepower 340 cubic inch engines.
===1972===
The Duster was not changed significantly for 1972. New surface-mount sidemarker lights replaced the previous flush-mount items, the taillamps became larger, one-piece units. The power rating of the 340 V8 was reduced from to due in part to a reduction in compression ratio from 10.2:1 to 8.5:1, as well as changing the intake valves from to . All horsepower rating numbers, even on unchanged engines, decreased for 1972 due to a new rating protocol. Chrysler&#x27;s electronic ignition became standard on the 340 models in 1972. Also, there was a 1-year only air cleaner that had a vacuum-operated door at the bottom to allow for additional airflow when the throttle is depressed.

===1973===
Following the design changes on the Valiant models, the Duster also received a new hood, grille, front fenders, bumpers, and taillights for 1973. The taillights in previous years mounted from the inside and had a flush appearance. Starting in 1973, the taillights were mounted from the outside and were trimmed in chrome. These remained unchanged through 1976. The Dodge version, the Demon, was rebranded &quot;Dart Sport&quot; in response to religious groups&#x27; opposition to the word, &quot;Demon.&quot;

Other changes were in store for the Plymouth Duster. Simpler single-piston slider-type disc brake calipers were introduced for the 1973 model year (standard on 318-powered cars and with power-assist on 340 models), replacing the Kelsey Hayes four-piston calipers. Disc brake-equipped Dusters now had the more-common 5-lugs on a 4.5-inch wheel bolt pattern. All 340 and some 318 engine-equipped cars received the simplified 8.25-inch rear axle assembly (with wheel bearings riding directly on the axle shaft and endplay being taken by C-clips); these axles also featured the 5 on a 4.5-inch wheel bolt pattern. (This axle assembly replaced the 8.75-inch &quot;drop-out&quot; arrangement seen on some 1966-1972 A-bodies). The 225-powered cars retained the 5-lugs on a 4-inch pattern on vehicles with the standard drum brakes. A three-speed Torque Flight automatic along with a manual transmission was offered with the 225 slant six. All models received larger front wheel bearings and increased spindle diameter. Electronic ignition became standard across the board.

Also, a Space Duster package was offered. This allowed the back bench seat to be folded down, allowing more space to carry cargo. There is also a security flap to hide cargo from outside view.

A new, metal sunroof was optional for 1973. The rear window defroster/defogger was upgraded to an electric-grid style for 1973, which replaced the previous recessed package shelf air blower.

===1974===
For 1974, Plymouth replaced the 340 with a version of the corporate LA-series V8, de-tuned to meet new emissions regulations. The new for 1974 &quot;E58&quot; 360 engine produced by utilizing the camshaft, heads, intake manifold, carburetor, and dual-exhaust set up from the past 340 engine. New retractable front seat belts were added. In the midst of the first oil crisis, 1974 would be the Duster&#x27;s best sales year, with a total of 281,378 Duster-bodied cars produced, the majority of which being the six-cylinder and 318 V8 models.
In 1974 there was a separate model called the Duster 360. Standard equipment included the 360 engine, dual exhaust, power disc brakes, full side tape stripe, rear tape stripe, heavier suspension, shocks, added sway bar, and 8 1/4&quot; rear end. Plymouth built 3,969 of these models and most came with automatic transmissions. Duster 360 options included Goodyear raised white letter tires on rally wheels. Air conditioning, a fold-back sunroof, and a flip-down rear seat were also available. 
===1975===
The 1975 models were mostly unchanged from the previous two years, with some exceptions: a new grille with a return of the Plymouth 3-pointed-&#x27;spear&#x27; affixed to the grille&#x27;s center; catalytic converters were added to 225 Slant Six and 318 V8 models (the 360 was not equipped with a converter and its power was now , due to the addition of a secondary air injection system, commonly referred to as a &quot;smog pump&quot;. Fewer than 2000 of the 1975 model Dusters left the factory equipped with the 360 engine.

===1976===
The grille-mounted park and turn signal lenses were amber; prior years had colorless lenses with amber bulbs. The interior rearview mirror was mounted directly to the windshield rather than to the previous double-pivot roof bracket, and the parking brake was now foot- rather than hand-operated. Disc brakes became standard equipment on cars built after 1 January 1976.

Several special models were offered:

* The Feather Duster featured lightweight aluminum parts including the intake manifold, bumper brackets, hood and trunk bracing, and manual transmission housing, for a weight savings of about —5% lighter than a standard Duster similarly equipped. It came with a 225 Slant Six with its distributor and single-barrel carburetor calibrated for greater economy, a low-restriction exhaust system, an extra-high rear axle ratio, and was offered with either the Torqueflite 3-speed automatic or A833 overdrive 4-speed manual transmission. It was the most fuel-efficient car in its size class, achieving up to 36 mpg on the highway and 24 in the city with the manual transmission option (along with Dodge&#x27;s version, the Dart Lite).
* The Space Duster had a fold-down rear seat and security panel and combined with the luggage compartment, offered over . of cargo space. (This feature was actually introduced, optionally, in 1973).
* The Silver Duster had special stripes and a cloth Boca Raton style interior.

The Duster 360 option was deleted as a separate model as the engine became an option on any trim level Duster, and about 1,300 cars were equipped with it. The 1976 360-powered Duster (and Dart Sport 360) was still without a catalytic converter, and while its power was down to , the car could still manage 0–60 mph in 7.9 seconds when equipped with the 3.21 rear axle gearing.

==Replacement==
In mid-1976 the Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare twins replaced the Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster, which were still based on bodies originally sold in 1967. The fastback coupes featured a solid B-pillar with fixed rear glass. These new models were introduced to compete with the more upscale Ford Granada and Mercury Monarch.

==Advertising==
From 1974 to 1975, actress Judy Strangis was a TV pitchwoman for the Plymouth Duster in the role of &quot;Mean Mary Jean,&quot; wearing a football jersey and short denim hot-pants. Strangis also promoted Plymouth&#x27;s Volare and Road Runner models and appeared at Chrysler-Plymouth promotions and auto shows.

<text>20 Massalia is a stony asteroid and the parent body of the Massalia family located in the inner region of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. Discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on 19 September 1852, it was named for the Latin name of the French city of Marseille, from which the independent discover Jean Chacornac sighted it the following night. It was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol by its discoverer.

It came to opposition 179 degrees from the Sun on 16 June 2023, and came to aphelion (farthest distance from the Sun) on 17 September 2023.

== Classification and orbit ==
&quot;Massalia&quot; is the namesake and the parent body of the Massalia family (), a very large inner belt asteroid family consisting of stony asteroids with very low inclinations. It is by far the largest body in this family. The remaining family members are fragments ejected by a cratering event on Massalia.

It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.1–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,366 days; semi-major axis of 2.41 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic.

== Physical characteristics ==
&quot;Massalia&quot; has an above-average density for S-type asteroids, similar to the density of silicate rocks. As such, it appears to be a solid unfractured body, a rarity among asteroids of its size. Apart from the few largest bodies over 400 km in diameter, such as 1 Ceres and 4 Vesta, most asteroids appear to have been significantly fractured, or are even rubble piles. In 1998, Bange estimated Massalia to have a mass of 5.2 kg assuming that 4 Vesta has 1.35 solar mass. The calculation of the mass of Massalia is dependent on the mass of 4 Vesta and perturbation of 44 Nysa.

Light curve analysis indicates that Massalia&#x27;s pole points towards ecliptic coordinates either (β, λ) = (45°, 10°) or (β, λ) = (45°, 190°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of 45° in both cases. The shape reconstruction from light curves has been described as quite spherical with large planar, nonconvex parts of the surface.

In 1988 there was a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but none were found.

In February 2024, water molecules were discovered on 20 Massalia, alongside 7 Iris, marking the first time water molecules were detected on asteroids.

== Discovery ==
Massalia was discovered on 19 September 1852, by Annibale de Gasparis at Naples Observatory in Italy, and also found independently the next night by Jean Chacornac at Marseilles Observatory, France. It was Chacornac&#x27;s discovery that was announced first. In the nineteenth century the variant spelling Massilia was often used. Asteroids discovered prior to Massalia were assigned iconic symbols, like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets. However, astronomers had begun to phase out this practice with the discovery of 16 Psyche in March 1852, and 20 Massalia (being the first object in the Solar System with a non-mythological name) was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol.
