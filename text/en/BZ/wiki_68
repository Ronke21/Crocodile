<text>The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) (IAST: &quot;Raksā Anūsandhān Evam Vikās Sangaṭhan&quot;) is an agency under the Department of Defence Research and Development in Ministry of Defence of the Government of India, charged with the military&#x27;s research and development, headquartered in Delhi, India. It was formed in 1958 by the merger of the Technical Development Establishment and the Directorate of Technical Development and Production of the Indian Ordnance Factories with the Defence Science Organisation under the administration of Jawaharlal Nehru. Subsequently, Defence Research &amp; Development Service (DRDS) was constituted in 1979 as a service of Group &#x27;A&#x27; Officers / Scientists directly under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.

With a network of 52 laboratories that are engaged in developing defence technologies covering various fields like aeronautics, armaments, electronics, land combat engineering, life sciences, materials, missiles, and naval systems, DRDO is India&#x27;s largest and most diverse research organisation. The organisation includes around 5,000 scientists belonging to the DRDS and about 25,000 other subordinate scientific, technical, and supporting personnel.

==History==

The DRDO was established in 1958 by combining the Defence Science Organisation and some of the technical development establishments. A separate Department of Defence Research and Development was formed in 1980, which later administered DRDO and its almost 30 laboratories and establishments (there were almost 52 labs before merging). Most of the time, the Defence Research and Development Organisation was treated as if it were a vendor and the Army Headquarters or the Air Force Headquarters were the customers. Because the Army and the Air Force themselves did not have any design or construction responsibility, they tended to treat the designer or Indian industry at par with their corresponding designer in the world market. If they could get a MiG-21 from the world market, they wanted a MiG-21 from DRDO.

DRDO started its first major project in surface-to-air missiles (SAM) known as Project Indigo in the 1960s. Indigo was discontinued in later years without achieving full success. Project Indigo led Project Devil, along with Project Valiant, to develop short-range SAM and ICBM in the 1970s. Project Devil itself led to the later development of the Prithvi missile under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) in the 1980s. IGMDP was an Indian Ministry of Defence programme between the early 1980s and 2007 for the development of a comprehensive range of missiles, including the Agni missile, Prithvi ballistic missile, Akash missile, Trishul missile and Nag Missile. In 2010, the defence minister A. K. Antony ordered the restructuring of the DRDO to give a major boost to defence research in the country and to ensure effective participation of the private sector in defence technology. The key measures to make DRDO effective in its functioning include the establishment of a Defence Technology Commission with the defence minister as its chairman. The programmes which were largely managed by DRDO have seen considerable success with many of the systems seeing rapid deployment as well as yielding significant technological benefits. Since its establishment, DRDO has created other major systems and critical technologies such as aircraft avionics, UAVs, small arms, artillery systems, EW Systems, tanks and armoured vehicles, sonar systems, command and control systems and missile systems.

In 2024, DRDO tested India&#x27;s first long-range hypersonic missile, that is able to carry conventional and nuclear warheads to a distance exceeding 1,500 km at a 3 km per second speed.

=== Plans for reforms ===
The Government of India has plans to overhaul and reform DRDO, and a committee was formed to suggest reforms and overhauls. The 9-member committee, which was under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), was led by former Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, K. Vijayraghavan. The committee submitted its report on the reforms for DRDO in July 2024. Reportedly, the recommendations from the committee have been described as contentious and it was also reported that the DRDO has agreed to implement approximately 60% of the major reforms. As of October 2024, the implementation of structural reforms has been delayed due to opposition from senior DRDO officials.

=== Cluster Laboratories/Establishments ===

As part of the rationalization plan, the Defence Terrain Research Laboratory (DTRL) was merged with the Snow and Avalanche Studies Establishment (SASE) which was renamed into the Defence Geological Research Establishment (DGRE). As of 2020, the Advanced Numerical Research and Analysis Group (ANURAG) and Laser Science and Technology Center (LASTEC) are no longer functional as independent entities. The staff are relocated to various DRDO labs in Hyderabad. DRDO is planning to build a new research lab in Lucknow.

== Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme ==
On 11 December 2024, under TDF, the iBooster Green Propulsion System was handed over to the DRDO by Manastu Space Technologies, based at IIT Bombay. For crucial satellite functions including orbit raising, orbital station-keeping, and deorbiting, the iBooster system—which is intended for spacecraft weighing between 100 and 500 kg—will be employed. Unlike hydrazine, it uses a patented hydrogen peroxide-based fuel that is safer, more affordable, and less harmful to the environment. The high-temperature catalyst in iBooster ensures smooth ignition, and the thruster design has been tuned for increased efficiency.

== Industry linkages, technology transfer and indigenisation ==
India domestically produces only 45% to 50% of defence products it uses, and the rest are imported. To become technology research and production leader, reduce reliance on the imports and increase self-reliance, DRDO Chief called for more collaboration with the industry, private sector, research and education institutes including IITs and NITs. India&#x27;s military–industrial complex has had little success and only recently private sector was allowed to enter the defence production. To expedite the development cycle of new technologies and to better fit the end user requirements, army has asked DRDO to take more army staff on deputation to be part of DRDO technology development project teams.

Indian forces are using numerous indigenous technologies produced by the DRDO, including Varunastra, Maareech, Ushus, and TAL by the navy; Electronic Warfare Technologies, radars, composite materials for LCA, AEW&amp;C, Astra, and LCA Tejas by airforce; and ASAT, BrahMos, ASTRA, Nag missile, SAAW, Arjun MBT Mk 1A, 46-metre Modular Bridge, MPR, LLTR Ashwin by the army. In September 2019, DRDO formulated the &quot;DRDO Policy and Procedures for Transfer of Technology&quot; and released information on &quot;DRDO-Industry Partnership: Synergy and Growth and DRDO Products with Potential for Export&quot;.

During the Vibrant Goa Global Expo and Summit 2019 in October, DRDO signed technology transfer contracts with 16 Indian companies, including 3 startups, to produce products for the use by Indian Armed Forces. This included high shelf life, high nutrition, ready-to-eat on-the-go food products to be consumed in the difficult terrain and bad weather. DRDO and ISRO have agreed to collaborate in India&#x27;s crewed orbital spacecraft project called Gaganyaan during which DRDOs various laboratories will tailor their defence capabilities to suit the needs of ISRO&#x27;s human space mission with critical human-centric systems and technologies like space grade food, crew healthcare, radiation measurement and protection, parachutes for the safe recovery of the crew module and fire suppression system etc. Kalyani Group is developing the Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System.

DRDO with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (FICCI) under Advance Assessment Technology and Commercialisation Programme is helping Lakes and Waterways Development Authority (LAWDA) to keep Dal Lake clean by providing low cost Biodigesters for the treatment of human excreta, animal waste disposal, grey water and kitchen waste release that works fine in ambient as well as sub zero temperature which are also supplied to Indian Railways.

Defence Research and Development Establishment (DRDE) which works in the field of chemical weapon, biological agent detection and research is helping Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in augmenting diagnostic capability for COVID-19 outbreak. It has created special hand sanitiser formulation and diagnostic kits following WHO standards and guidelines that are supplied in large numbers to civilian and defence officials. Medical staff all over India dealing with Coronavirus contamination are using protective waterproof clothing with special sealant used in submarine applications developed by Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) for CBRN defence that is made up of high strength polyester coated with breathable polymer. The clothing underwent successful trials at the South India Textile Research Association and exceeds the criteria of currently available suits in the market. The suit is washable, passed all critical CBRN and ASTM standards and is now manufactured by two private players, Venus Industries from Mumbai and IMTEC from Kolkata. Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL) developed causality evacuation bag for COVID-19 infected patients that can withstand Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) environments and is protected against blood and viral penetration. The bag is made up of durable water-repellent nonwoven fabric. It is rigid and cylindrical with air and waterproof zippers and ventilators. Already ordered 500 in numbers, DRDO will now transfer the technology to the private sector for manufacturing.

Under the Society for Biomedical Technology (SBMT) programme, DEBEL has developed five-layer nanomesh based N99 masks and is collaborating with Mysore-based Skanray Technologies for the production of ventilators using currently available technologies with Indian made parts due to unavailability of imports. It is also working on a new multiplexed ventilator technology that will be able to support several infected individuals on a single ventilator. The prototype development stage is complete and the initial model is now undergoing various improvements suggested by a team of medical researchers and doctors. The technology will finally be transferred to Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, Hyundai Motor India, Honda Cars India and Maruti Suzuki for immediate mass production. DRDO signed agreement with Indian Telephone Industries Limited for tech transfer on low cost multiplexed ventilator technology with 80% to 90% of components are now make in India.

DRDO as of 11 April 2020 transferred technologies to 30 major companies to manufacture various non-medicine products against the COVID-19 pandemic which includes ventilators, sanitiser, personal protective equipment, face shield and isolation shelters. The technology for the newly developed multiplexed ventilator came from the onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS) developed for HAL Tejas. Private sector players like Raksha Polycoats and Accurate Savan Defence are now producing protective clothing, isolation shelters based on DRDO tech developed for high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) bags, submarine escape the suit and satellite recovery systems. Hyderabad-based 3D printing startup iMake with Modern Manufacturers and Kirat Mechanical Engineering from Chandigarh, Wipro 3D from Bengaluru and Global Healthcare from Delhi are 3D printing visor-based face shields which is an offshoot of the tech developed for high-altitude military parachuting. Setco from Mumbai is producing sealants developed for submarines of Indian Navy at DRDO labs for personal protection equipment.

Research Centre Imarat (RCI) and Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) developed a product called Aerosol Containment Box for enclosure of intubation procedure made with Poly(methyl methacrylate). It is cubical designed for both adults and minors and covers the COVID-19-infected patients during medical examination and treatment from head to chest to stop the transmission of droplets containing the virus to others. Employees&#x27; State Insurance Corporation Medical College, Hyderabad helped RCI in prototype development while Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research helped in testing, validation and acceptance of products for medical use. The technology is now transferred to private industries located in Chandigarh and Hyderabad for mass manufacturing. RCI at DRDO Missile Complex, Hyderabad is now supplying technology of brushless DC motors (BLDC) used for missile actuators and high response solenoid valves used in missile control for ventilator pumps that validated the prototype testing stages.

Centre for Fire, Explosive and Environment Safety (CFEES) developed two sanitising equipment of 50 litres tank capacity consisting of a portable backpack type that covers an area of 300 metres while another trolley mounted for large area sanitisation of up to 3000 metres by spraying 1% hypochlorite solution.

Vehicle Research and Development Establishment (VRDE) developed a portable disinfection chamber and special face protection mask for health professional combating the COVID-19 outbreak in India. The personnel decontamination system is equipped with sanitiser and soap dispenser. The full-body decontamination starts using for pedal with an electrically operated pump creating a disinfectant mist of 700-litre of hypo sodium chloride. The system takes 25 seconds for full decontamination with an automatic shut-off procedure and can decontaminate 650 personnel until the next refill. The face mask developed for COVID-19 patients uses the A4 size Over-Head Projection (OHP) film for protection and lightweight materials for long duration comfortable use. VRDE developed full-body decontamination chamber was designed and validated within 4 days with All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi became the first premier institution to use it. The mass manufacturing of the portable decontamination chamber is now done by Dass Hitachi Limited.

=== Development cum Production Partner programme ===
As part of Make In India and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, DRDO under the Development cum Production Partner programme (DcPP) allowed handholding of domestic private sector industries to improve their development and production cycle of complex defence systems.

VL-SRSAM (Vertical Launch - Short Range Surface to Air Missile) and Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS) became some of the successful projects of this programme.

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited on 17 December 2021, secured an order for manufacturing, assembly, integration, testing and supply of DRDO Abhyas from Aeronautical Development Establishment. The order will be completed under Development-cum-Production Partner (DcPP) with a private sector industry.

On 16 December 2021, Ashok Leyland signed partnership agreement with Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) to develop 600  hp engine for Future Combat Vehicle Programme. Instruments Research and Development Establishment (IRDE) on 27 December 2021 transferred technologies for developing border surveillance system to Indian private sector company Paras Defence and Space. The system consists of radar, and electro-optical sensors mounted on a pan tilt platform. On 28 December 2021, Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS) transferred technology to manufacture extreme cold weather clothing system to RHD Business Services, SBNX Innovation, Shiva Texyarn Limited, Kusumgar Corporates and Ginni Filaments Limited.

DRDO on 8 January 2024 launched Ugram, an assault rifle chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO, which has been designed, developed and manufactured in collaboration with Dvipa Armour India Private Limited under DcPP. It&#x27;s scheduled to be tested by the Indian Army.

<doc id="745676" wikidata="Q3022233" url="?curid=745676" title="Demons Dance Alone">
<text>Demons Dance Alone is a 2002 concept album (and 2003 DVD) by American art rock group the Residents about the emotional effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The album is split into three main parts, &quot;Loss&quot;, &quot;Denial&quot;, and &quot;The Three Metaphors&quot;, bookended by &quot;Tongue&quot; and &quot;Demons Dance Alone&quot;, and broken up by various untitled transitional instrumentals.

== CD ==
The CD booklet contains the section &quot;The Residents Have Left The Building&quot;, which at first might be taken to indicate that none of the original members are still in the band. It does state that &quot;a few&quot; of those involved are &quot;the flesh and blood residue of our mythical heroes, maintaining appearances for mostly sentimental reasons. But can any of these shadowy sidemen truthfully call themselves THE RESIDENTS? No more than you or I, but if no one claims to be a RESIDENT, doesn&#x27;t that mean everyone is a potential RESIDENT? Don&#x27;t we all get their mail?&quot;

&quot;Demons Dance Alone&quot; was reissued on CD by Cryptic / MVDaudio in 2016 (MVD8235A).

==Vocals==
Credited guest artist Molly Harvey plays an expanded role on this album. She leads entirely on &quot;The Weatherman&quot;, &quot;Caring&quot;, &quot;The Car Thief&quot;, and &quot;The Beekeeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, as well as partial leads on &quot;Life Would Be Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Ghost Child&quot;.

Another notable voice is that of a child, who sings on &quot;Mickey Macaroni&quot; and &quot;Make Me Moo&quot;.

Most of the songs are led or partially led by The Residents&#x27; main singer, a man with a low, &quot;hard whisper&quot; singing voice.

== DVD ==
A DVD with the same title was released in 2003, consisting of 14 of the tunes from the CD (three versions of &quot;Life Would Be Wonderful&quot;), recorded at various live performances of the &quot;Demons Dance Alone&quot; tour. The DVD is not a straight concert video, but is structured as an independent stand-alone work, based on the music from the CD, and includes experimental video work, such as the use of infrared cameras.

As is usual for the Residents, the performers are masked and costumed, in this case most in quasi-military clothing. The instrumentalists are garbed in extreme camouflage outfits, and perform behind a camouflage net. Stage action is carried out primarily by the lead singer, and Harvey (also masked and in costume), and by an acrobatic dancer clad in a red body suit, made up as a demon, and wielding two million-candle-power spotlights or, occasionally, a trumpet. The dancer-demon never speaks or sings, but does interact with the other two characters on stage in other ways. The content of the DVD is bracketed at the beginning and the end with musical excerpts from the 1933 film King Kong.

<doc id="745678" wikidata="Q325479" url="?curid=745678" title="Dhiyab bin Isa Al Nahyan">
<text>Sheikh Dhiyab ibn Isa Al Nahyan was the Sheikh of the Bani Yas of the Liwa Oasis (Abu Dhabi emirate) from 1761 to 1793 and the founder of the Al Bu Falah dynasty, which still rules Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), today.

==Life==
Dhiyab ibn Isa, leader of the Bani Yas tribal confederation, sent a hunting party from Liwa in 1761 which tracked a gazelle to a brackish spring on the island. The gazelle became the symbol of Abu Dhabi, and gave it its name (literally &quot;Father of the Gazelle&quot;). In 1793, Dhiyab ordered his son Shakbut to move to the island. He did and then built a village of some 20 houses and a fort there.

The village expanded quickly, and within two years there were 400 houses on the island, which quickly became the capital of the Bani Yas.

In 1793 Dhiyab visited Abu Dhabi in order to tell a branch of the Al Bu Falah led by his cousin Hazza bin Zayed bin Muhammad bin Falah to stop stirring up trouble with a neighbouring tribe. Hazza, who was in Bahrain at the time, returned and killed Dhiyab during an argument between them. The Bani Yas elders supported Dhiyab’s son, Shakhbut, and Hazza went into exile after his supporters were defeated. Dhiyab&#x27;s son Shakhbut acceded as sheikh.

<doc id="745683" wikidata="Q714483" url="?curid=745683" title="Don Walsh">
<text>Don Walsh (November 2, 1931 – November 12, 2023) was an American oceanographer, U.S. Navy officer and marine policy specialist. While aboard the bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot;, he and Jacques Piccard made a record maximum descent in the Challenger Deep on January 23, 1960, to . Later and more accurate measurements have measured it at .
== Early life and education ==
Walsh was born in Berkeley, California on November 2, 1931. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1954, and later, a Master&#x27;s degree in political science from San Diego State University, and a PhD in physical oceanography from Texas A&amp;M University. 

== Career ==
Walsh served 24 years in the U.S. Navy upon graduation from the Academy, spanning the Korean and Vietnam Wars. He served as a submarine officer and was a qualified Navy Diver.

He attained the rank of captain by the time he retired. He spent fifteen years at sea, mostly in submarines, and was a submarine commander. He also worked with ocean-related research and development for the Navy.

Walsh was appointed as special assistant to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research and Development from 1971 to 1972. 

Serving as Dean of Marine Programs and Professor of Ocean Engineering at the University of Southern California, Walsh initiated and directed the university&#x27;s Institute for Marine and Coastal Studies. In 1989, his company, International Maritime Incorporated, contracted a joint venture with the P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology to establish an underwater maintenance company, Soyuz Marine Service, which continues to operate in the Russian Federation. Walsh continued to support ocean sciences in his work on the Ocean Sciences Board at the National Academy of Sciences.

He managed a marine consulting business beginning in 1976, and conducted about five deep-sea expeditions per year. 

Walsh held a faculty appointment at Oregon State University in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences.

It was reported in 2010 that Walsh visited the deep-sea submersible &quot;Jiaolong&quot; and its makers at the China Ship Scientific Research Center. The craft had &quot;planted a Chinese flag on the bottom of the South China Sea during a two-mile-deep dive in June&quot; as the Chinese program—which Walsh characterized as &quot;very deliberate&quot;—proceeded toward its ambitious goal of diving to 7,000 meters, or 4.35 miles, in 2012.

== Personal life ==
Walsh lived with his wife, Joan, in Sitkum, Oregon, on a ranch which they bought 1992. They had two children together. Walsh remained active with the National Academy of Sciences and the Ocean Elders organization. 

Walsh was on-site to congratulate Victor Vescovo when he completed his own record-breaking series of dives in the Challenger Deep in 2019. In June 2020, Walsh&#x27;s son Kelly dived to the bottom of the Challenger Deep with Vescovo, becoming the twelfth person to reach the deepest point in the ocean.

Walsh died at his home in Myrtle Point, Oregon on November 12, 2023, at the age of 92.

== Media ==
Walsh visited the wreck of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; on board the submersible MIR 2 on 20 July 2001.

Walsh joined the team that oversaw the dive of the &quot;Deepsea Challenger&quot; mission, during which James Cameron dived solo to the bottom of the Challenger Deep, on March 26, 2012.

Walsh was the inspiration for Chris Wright&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;No More Worlds to Conquer&quot;, and his interview constitutes the opening chapter. The book, about moving on from the defining moment in one&#x27;s life, was inspired by Walsh&#x27;s answer to Wright&#x27;s question, &quot;What came next after the &quot;Trieste&quot; dive?&quot; Walsh responded, &quot;Well, a lot of people think I died.&quot;

== Honors ==
Walsh was appointed by Presidents Carter and Reagan to the U.S. National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere, was a member of the Law of the Sea Advisory Committee for the U.S. Department of State, and served as a member of the Marine Board of the U.S. National Research Council from 1990 to 1993. 

In 2001, Walsh was elected to the National Academy of Engineering. 

Walsh was named one of the world&#x27;s great explorers by &quot;Life&quot; magazine. 
On April 14, 2010, The National Geographic Society awarded its highest honor, the Hubbard Medal, to Walsh. The U.S. Navy awarded Walsh its Distinguished Public Service Award.

On September 22, 2020, The Marine Technology Society and The Society for Underwater Technology announced that the inaugural recipient of their new MTS/SUT Captain Don Walsh Award for Ocean Exploration was Edith Widder.

On January 10, 2025, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro announced the lead ship of the of ocean surveillance ships will be named the USNS &quot;Don Walsh&quot; (T-AGOS 25) after Walsh. Walsh&#x27;s spouse and daughter, Joan Walsh and Liz Walsh, were named ship sponsors.

== Awards and decorations ==
Recognitions include the following:

===Legion of Merit citation===

<doc id="745684" wikidata="Q122260053" url="?curid=745684" title="Douglaston–Little Neck, Queens">
<text>Douglaston–Little Neck is a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the New York City borough of Queens. The community is located on the North Shore of Long Island, bordered to the east by the region of Great Neck in Nassau County, to the south by Glen Oaks and the North Shore Towers, and to the west by Bayside.

The neighborhood is composed of two main sections. Little Neck is generally used to refer to the area east of Marathon Parkway and/or north of Northern Boulevard, while Douglaston is the rest of the neighborhood; these classifications may overlap depending on different interpretations of neighborhood boundaries. Each of these areas has several subsections. Douglaston–Little Neck represents one of the least traditionally urban communities in New York City, with many areas (particularly those north of Northern Boulevard) having a distinctly suburban feel, similar to that of Nassau County towns located nearby such as Great Neck.

The area is also known for its historical society and other civic groups, notably the Douglaston Civic Association and the Douglas Manor Association. There are two historic districts, Douglas Manor and Douglaston Hill, and two houses, Allen-Beville House and Cornelius Van Wyck House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the neighborhood.

Douglaston–Little Neck is located in Queens Community District 11 and its ZIP Codes are 11362 and 11363. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 111th Precinct. Politically, Douglaston–Little Neck is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 19th and 23rd Districts.

==Geography==
Douglaston–Little Neck is bounded by Cross Island Parkway to the west, Grand Central Parkway to the south, the New York City-Nassau County border to the east, and Little Neck Bay to the north.

Douglaston is considered to be the area located west of Marathon Parkway and north of Grand Central Parkway. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Douglaston comprises six distinct neighborhoods. Douglas Bay, Douglas Manor, and Douglaston Hill are located north of Northern Boulevard, on the peninsula abutting Little Neck Bay. Douglas Manor takes up most of the peninsula located north of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Washington Branch, while Douglaston Hill takes up a small section between the LIRR and Northern Boulevard. Douglaston Park is the area located between Northern Boulevard and Interstate 495 (I-495, the Long Island Expressway). Additionally, there are two areas south of I-495, Winchester Estates and an area simply called Douglaston. Winchester Estates is located west of Douglaston Park and the remainder of the area south of I-495 is without a distinct name other than Douglaston.

Little Neck is the area east of Marathon Parkway and north of Grand Central Parkway. Little Neck itself has three subsections: Pines, Westmoreland, and Little Neck Hills.

==History==
===Early settlement===
The earliest known residents of the area that would become Douglaston–Little Neck were the Matinecock Native Americans. They were sustained by the seafood in Little Neck Bay.

Early Dutch settlers were drawn to the area by the rich land and abundant fishing. In the 17th century, European settlers began arriving in the area for its conveniently located harbor. Soon after, the British and Dutch gained control of the Matinecock lands peacefully, except for a small area known as Madnan&#x27;s Neck (possibly a shortened form of Native American name for the area, Menhaden-ock, or &quot;place of fish&quot;). Thomas Hicks, of the Hicks family that eventually founded Hicksville, and a band of armed settlers forcibly drove out the Matinecock in a battle at today&#x27;s Northern Boulevard and Marathon Parkway.

===19th century===
In 1796, Hicks&#x27;s estate passed to Thomas Wickes (1770–1854), and in 1819, to Wyant Van Zandt, a wealthy merchant, who built a large Greek Revival mansion in the area. Today, this mansion houses the Douglaston Club, a private club with tennis courts, social activities and swimming pools. In 1835, George Douglas bought of land along with Van Zandt&#x27;s mansion. Upon Douglas&#x27; death in 1862, the land was inherited by his son, William Douglas.

Douglaston Hill is the oldest area of the community, and is characterized by turn-of-the-20th-century homes in Queen Anne and Victorian styles. It was laid out with very large lots in 1853, at the very beginning of a movement in the United States to create suburban gardens. The area was recognized as a New York City Historic District in December 2004 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Douglaston Hill Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

The settlers thrived producing produce for the Manhattan market and the area was used as a dock on Little Neck Bay. The Little Neck and Douglaston stations opened in 1866 on the North Shore Railroad (now the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Washington Branch and the same line featured prominently in the famous F. Scott Fitzgerald novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;) to serve the community and the dock area. Northern Boulevard was developed into a commercial and cultural hub, and the Little Neck Theater, a 576-seat movie theater, was opened in 1929 at the intersection of Northern Boulevard and Morgan Street. The theater was closed in 1983.

From the 1860s through the 1890s, small hard clams (quahogs) from Little Neck Bay were served in the best restaurants of New York and several European capitals. Eventually, the term &quot;littleneck&quot; or &quot;littleneck clam&quot; came to be used as a size category for all hard clams, regardless of origin.

Little Neck was also famous for being the last stop on the Underground Railroad until 1865.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, the Rickert-Finlay Realty Company of Manhattan purchased of the Douglas&#x27; family holdings, and formed the Douglas Manor Association, creating a planned community. Many of the houses in this area were built in architectural styles popular at the time, such as Tudor, Mediterranean, Colonial Revival, and Arts and Crafts. In 1997, New York City&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Douglas Manor as the Douglaston Historic District, ensuring that no new buildings or external alterations could be made without the commission&#x27;s approval. The Douglaston Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

An old Matinecock cemetery remained on Northern Boulevard between Cornell Lane and Jesse Court. One of the last photographs of the cemetery was taken by the &quot;Daily News&quot; in August 1931, a few months before it was removed to make room for a widened Northern Boulevard. The remains from the cemetery were moved to the Zion Episcopal Church of Douglaston and placed under a stone marker that reads &quot;Here rest the last of the Matinecoc.&quot;

Other areas of Douglaston–Little Neck were developed during the latter half of the 20th century. Douglaston Park contains a mixture of large, older homes as well as Capes, Tudors, and ranch-style homes dating from the 1960s. The areas adjacent to the Douglaston Shopping Center are occupied mainly by attached single-family homes built in the 1950s through 1970s (Beech Hills, Deepdale, and another development known colloquially as the &quot;Korvette&#x27;s Houses&quot; due to the former proximity of an E.J. Korvette department store), as well as four-story condominiums added in the mid-1980s.

In addition to the Douglaston Historic District and Douglaston Hill Historic District, the Allen-Beville House and Cornelius Van Wyck House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Free and Open source Software Developers&#x27; European Meeting (FOSDEM) is a non-commercial, volunteer-organized European event centered on free and open-source software development. It is aimed at developers and anyone interested in the free and open-source software movement. It aims to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open-source software.

FOSDEM is held annually, usually during the first weekend of February, at the of the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in the southeast of Brussels, Belgium.

==History==

FOSDEM was started in 2000 under the name Open Source Developers of Europe Meeting (OSDEM) by Raphael Bauduin. Bauduin said that since he felt he lacked the brains to properly contribute to the open-source community, he wanted to contribute by launching a European event in Brussels. Bauduin teamed up with Damien Sandras.
The team repeated the event. The F (of FOSDEM) was added at the request of Richard Stallman.

The Free Software Foundation&#x27;s ceremony for the Award for the Advancement of Free Software was held at FOSDEM from 2002 to 2006 (for the awards for 2001 to 2005).

The event has been held annually in February since then, with growing numbers of visitors, talks and tracks. It is organized thanks to the help of many volunteers.

The conference attracted about 4,000 visitors as of 2011. By 2013 this grew to 5,000 attendees. Since 2017, FOSDEM attendance is estimated at over 8,000 visitors.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, FOSDEM 2021 and 2022 were held entirely online.

In the following editions (2023 to 2025) of FOSDEM the main structure comprised keynotes, main tracks, developer rooms, lightning talks, stands and Birds Of a Feather (BOF, which is a freer format spread over 3 different rooms). As in previous editions, the activities were held at the Université Libre de Bruxelles using a total of 35 rooms.

=== FOSDEM 2023 ===
It was organised again in Brussels, celebrating 25 years of open source, with a total of 787 speakers spread over 781 events, and 63 tracks. Beyond the core activities FOSDEM also organised the FOSDEM Fringe as a set of independent events also related to free and open source. The number of attends was about 8000 for this edition, the two external keynotes speakers of this edition came from the Linux Foundation and NASA open source.

=== FOSDEM 2024 ===
As usual, it was held in Brussels, with 948 speakers spread over 875 events and 67 themes, using the same infrastructure as the previous edition at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. The programme was similar to that of 2023 with a FOSDEM Fringe and a new set of activities named FOSDEM Junior designed as workshops for children/teenagers from 7 to 17 years old. The keynotes of this edition were about the historical value of women in technology by Laura Durieux (a recurring topic of keynotes and talks in FOSDEM to improve social diversity in the FOSS communities) and the achievements of Outreachy. The Open Source Observatory (OSOR) participated in several activities of the conference, among which was a satellite workshop.

=== FOSDEM 2025 ===

As usual, it took place in Brussels with 1118 speakers spread over 1074 events and 78 tracks, showing that the size of the event is growing steadily. As usual beyond BoF, also FOSDEM Fringe and FOSDEM Junior has been organized. The number of keynotes at this edition has increased compared to 2023 and 2024. Jack Dorsey&#x27;s scheduled talk representing Block, Inc. caused controversy due to Dorsey&#x27;s involvement in selling Twitter to Elon Musk, together with doubts about the actual background of the speaker in open-source activities, as well as, the ethical concerns of Block, Inc. current business. The Open Source Observatory (OSOR) of the European Commission participates in several developer rooms dedicated to policy and public use of open source.

<doc id="745699" wikidata="Q5475005" url="?curid=745699" title="Four Aces (passenger liners)">
<text>The 4 Aces were the quartet of passenger-cargo liners &quot;Excalibur&quot;, &quot;Exochorda&quot;, &quot;Exeter&quot;, and &quot;Excambion&quot;, originally built for American Export Lines by New York Shipbuilding of Camden, New Jersey between 1929 and 1931. AEL placed the &quot;4 Aces&quot; in service between the US and the Mediterranean, offering cruises of up to 40 days.

During World War II, all four vessels were taken over by the U.S. Navy, renamed, and designated as AP- and APA-class troop transports. &quot;Excambion&quot; became USS &quot;John Penn&quot; (APA-23), &quot;Excalibur&quot; became USS &quot;Joseph Hewes&quot; (AP-50), &quot;Exeter&quot; became USS &quot;Edward Rutledge&quot; (AP-52), and &quot;Exochorda&quot; became USS &quot;Harry Lee&quot;. 

&quot;Excambion&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, and &quot;Exeter&quot; were lost to enemy action; after the war &quot;Exochorda&quot; was sold to Turkish Maritime Lines and renamed &quot;Tarsus&quot;.

During World War II the company&#x27;s subsidiary American Export Airlines borrowed three of the names (excepting &quot;Exochorda&quot;) for its Sikorsky VS-44 flying boats, which it used in transatlantic service. &quot;Excambion&quot; is preserved on display at the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.

==The New “4 Aces”==

After World War II, American Export Lines purchased four C3-class &quot;Windsor&quot;-class attack transports built by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. at Sparrow&#x27;s Point, Maryland, had them refitted as passenger-cargo liners, and placed them in service as the new &quot;4 Aces.&quot; USS &quot;Dauphin&quot; became &quot;Exochorda&quot;, USS &quot;Dutchess&quot; became &quot;Excalibur&quot;, USS &quot;Queens&quot; became &quot;Excambion&quot; and USS &quot;Shelby&quot; (APA-105) became &quot;Exeter&quot;. The quartet sailed under the AEL flag until the 1960s.

In 1968, the post-war SS &quot;Exochorda&quot; was purchased by Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey to alleviate a shortage of on-campus student housing. It was refurbished at Bethlehem Steel Shipyard in Hoboken, renamed SS &quot;Stevens&quot; and anchored on the Hudson River adjacent to the campus, where it served a dormitory. It remained in service until 1975, when skyrocketing utility costs made its continued operation prohibitive. Before it was towed away and sold for scrap, one of &quot;Stevens&quot;″ anchors was removed and permanently displayed on campus as a memento.

In 1965, the post-war &quot;Excambion&quot; became USTS &quot;Texas Clipper&quot; for service with the Texas Maritime Academy until being sunk as an artificial reef on November 17, 2007.

<doc id="745701" wikidata="Q2509690" url="?curid=745701" title="Free-radical addition">
<text>In organic chemistry, free-radical addition is an addition reaction which involves free radicals. These reactions can happen due to the free radicals having an unpaired electron in their valence shell, making them highly reactive. Radical additions are known for a variety of unsaturated substrates, both olefinic or aromatic and with or without heteroatoms.

Free-radical reactions depend on one or more relatively weak bonds in a reagent. Under reaction conditions (typically heat or light), some weak bonds homolyse into radicals, which then induce further decomposition in their compatriots before recombination. Different mechanisms typically apply to reagents without such a weak bond.

== Mechanism and regiochemistry ==

The basic steps in any free-radical process (the radical chain mechanism) divide into:
* Radical initiation: A radical is created from a non-radical precursor.
* Chain propagation: A radical reacts with a non-radical to produce a new radical species
* Chain termination: Two radicals react with each other to create a non-radical species

In a free-radical addition, there are two chain propagation steps. In one, the adding radical attaches to a multiply-bonded precursor to give a radical with lesser bond order. In the other, the newly-formed radical product abstracts another substituent from the adding reagent to regenerate the adding radical.

In general, the adding radical attacks the alkene at the most sterically accessible (typically, least substituted) carbon; the radical then stabilizes on the more substituted carbon. The result is typically anti-Markovnikov addition, a phenomenon Morris Kharasch called the &quot;peroxide effect&quot;. Reaction is slower with alkynes than alkenes.

In the paradigmatic example, hydrogen bromide radicalyzes to monatomic bromine. These bromine atoms add to an alkene at the most accessible site, to give a bromoalkyl radical, with the radical on the more substituted carbon. That radical then abstracts a hydrogen atom from another HBr molecule to regenerate the monatomic bromine and continue the reaction.

== Compounds that add radically ==

Radical addition of hydrogen bromide is a valuable synthetic technique for anti-Markovnikov carbon substitution, but free-radical addition does not occur with the other hydrohalic acids. Radical formation from HF, HCl, or HI is extremely endothermic and chemically disfavored. Hydrogen bromide is incredibly selective as a reagent, and does not produce detectable quantities of polymeric byproducts.

The behavior of hydrogen bromide generalizes in two separate directions. Halogenated compounds with a relatively stable radical can dissociate from the halogen. Thus, for example, sulfonyl, sulfenyl, and other sulfur halides can add radically to give respectively βhalo sulfones, sulfoxides, or sulfides.

Separately, unsubsituted compounds with a relative stable radical can dissociate from hydrogen. In general, these reactions risk polymerized byproducts (see ). For example, in the thiol-ene reaction, thiols, disulfides, and hydrogen sulfide add across a double bond. But if the unsaturated substrate polymerizes easily, they catalyze polymerization instead. In thermal silane additions, telomerization usually proceeds to about 6 units.

In the case of silicon, germanium, or phosphorus, the energetics are unfavorable unless the heavy atom bears a pendant hydrogen. Other electronegative substituents on silicon appear to reduce the barrier.

Although nitrogen oxides naturally radicalize, careful control of the radical species is difficult. Dinitrogen tetroxide adds to give a mixture: a vicinal dinitro compound, but also a nitro substituent adjacent to a nitrite ester.

== To aryl radicals ==

Although aromatic resonance stabilizes aryl radicals, bonds between arenes and their substituents are (in)famously strong. Radical reactions with arenes typically present retrosynthetically as instances of nucleophilic aromatic substitution, because generating the aryl radical requires a strong (radical) leaving group. One example is the Meerwein arylation.

== Side reactions ==
A radical addition which leaves an unsaturated product can undergo radical cyclization between the two propagation steps. In general, radical additions can also start radical polymerization processes.

==With stable inorganic radicals==

In self-terminating oxidative radical cyclization, inorganic radicals oxidize alkynes to ketones through an intramolecular radical cyclization. This reaction is not catalytic, and requires the oxidized radical source in stoichiometric amounts. In effect, the radical species is synthetically equivalent to monatomic oxygen.

In the paradigmatic example, a nitrate radical (from photolysis of ceric ammonium nitrate) adds to an alkyne to generate a very reactive vinyl nitrate ester radical. The vinyl radical abstracts an intramolecular hydrogen atom 5 atoms away before 5-&quot;exo&quot;-trig ring-closure. The resulting alkyl nitrate radical can then fragment to a ketone and the stable radical nitrogen dioxide.

Sulfate (from ammonium persulfate) and hydroxyl radicals show similar reactivity.

<doc id="745714" wikidata="Q5597156" url="?curid=745714" title="Graphic matroid">
<text>In the mathematical theory of matroids, a graphic matroid (also called a cycle matroid or polygon matroid) is a matroid whose independent sets are the forests in a given finite undirected graph. The dual matroids of graphic matroids are called co-graphic matroids or bond matroids. A matroid that is both graphic and co-graphic is sometimes called a planar matroid (but this should not be confused with matroids of rank 3, which generalize planar point configurations); these are exactly the graphic matroids formed from planar graphs.

==Definition==
A matroid may be defined as a family of finite sets (called the &quot;independent sets&quot; of the matroid) that is closed under subsets and that satisfies the &quot;exchange property&quot;: if sets formula_1 and formula_2 are both independent, and formula_1 is larger than formula_2, then there is an element formula_5 such that formula_6 remains independent. If formula_7 is an undirected graph, and formula_8 is the family of sets of edges that form forests in formula_7, then formula_8 is clearly closed under subsets (removing edges from a forest leaves another forest). It also satisfies the exchange property: if formula_1 and formula_2 are both forests, and formula_1 has more edges than formula_2, then it has fewer connected components, so by the pigeonhole principle there is a component formula_15 of formula_1 that contains vertices from two or more components of formula_2. Along any path in formula_15 from a vertex in one component of formula_2 to a vertex of another component, there must be an edge with endpoints in two components, and this edge may be added to formula_2 to produce a forest with more edges. Thus, formula_8 forms the independent sets of a matroid, called the graphic matroid of formula_7 or formula_23. More generally, a matroid is called graphic whenever it is isomorphic to the graphic matroid of a graph, regardless of whether its elements are themselves edges in a graph.

The bases of a graphic matroid formula_23 are the full spanning forests of formula_7, and the circuits of formula_23 are the simple cycles of formula_7. The rank in formula_23 of a set formula_29 of edges of a graph formula_7 is formula_31 where formula_32 is the number of vertices in the subgraph formed by the edges in formula_29 and formula_34 is the number of connected components of the same subgraph. The corank of the graphic matroid is known as the circuit rank or cyclomatic number.

==The lattice of flats==
The closure formula_35 of a set formula_36 of edges in formula_23 is a flat consisting of the edges that are not independent of formula_36 (that is, the edges whose endpoints are connected to each other by a path in formula_36). This flat may be identified with the partition of the vertices of formula_7 into the connected components of the subgraph formed by formula_36: Every set of edges having the same closure as formula_36 gives rise to the same partition of the vertices, and formula_35 may be recovered from the partition of the vertices, as it consists of the edges whose endpoints both belong to the same set in the partition. In the lattice of flats of this matroid, there is an order relation formula_44 whenever the partition corresponding to flat formula_45 is a refinement of the partition corresponding to flat formula_46.

In this aspect of graphic matroids, the graphic matroid for a complete graph formula_47 is particularly important, because it allows every possible partition of the vertex set to be formed as the set of connected components of some subgraph. Thus, the lattice of flats of the graphic matroid of formula_47 is naturally isomorphic to the lattice of partitions of an formula_32-element set. Since the lattices of flats of matroids are exactly the geometric lattices, this implies that the lattice of partitions is also geometric. 

==Representation==
The graphic matroid of a graph formula_7 can be defined as the column matroid of any oriented incidence matrix of formula_7. Such a matrix has one row for each vertex, and one column for each edge. The column for edge formula_52 has formula_53 in the row for one endpoint, formula_54 in the row for the other endpoint, and formula_55 elsewhere; the choice of which endpoint to give which sign is arbitrary. The column matroid of this matrix has as its independent sets the linearly independent subsets of columns.

If a set of edges contains a cycle, then the corresponding columns (multiplied by formula_54 if necessary to reorient the edges consistently around the cycle) sum to zero, and is not independent. Conversely, if a set of edges forms a forest, then by repeatedly removing leaves from this forest it can be shown by induction that the corresponding set of columns is independent. Therefore, the column matrix is isomorphic to formula_23.

This method of representing graphic matroids works regardless of the field over which the incidence is defined. Therefore, graphic matroids form a subset of the regular matroids, matroids that have representations over all possible fields.

The lattice of flats of a graphic matroid can also be realized as the lattice of a hyperplane arrangement, in fact as a subset of the braid arrangement, whose hyperplanes are the diagonals formula_58. Namely, if the vertices of formula_7 are formula_60 we include the hyperplane formula_61 whenever formula_62 is an edge of formula_7.

==Matroid connectivity==
A matroid is said to be connected if it is not the direct sum of two smaller matroids; that is, it is connected if and only if there do not exist two disjoint subsets of elements such that the rank function of the matroid equals the sum of the ranks in these separate subsets. Graphic matroids are connected if and only if the underlying graph is both connected and 2-vertex-connected.

==Minors and duality==

A matroid is graphic if and only if its minors do not include any of five forbidden minors: the uniform matroid formula_64, the Fano plane or its dual, or the duals of formula_65 and formula_66 defined from the complete graph formula_67 and the complete bipartite graph formula_68. The first three of these are the forbidden minors for the regular matroids, and the duals of formula_65 and formula_66 are regular but not graphic.

If a matroid is graphic, its dual (a &quot;co-graphic matroid&quot;) cannot contain the duals of these five forbidden minors. Thus, the dual must also be regular, and cannot contain as minors the two graphic matroids formula_65 and formula_66.

Because of this characterization and Wagner&#x27;s theorem characterizing the planar graphs as the graphs with no formula_67 or formula_68 graph minor, it follows that a graphic matroid formula_23 is co-graphic if and only if formula_7 is planar; this is Whitney&#x27;s planarity criterion. If formula_7 is planar, the dual of formula_23 is the graphic matroid of the dual graph of formula_7. While formula_7 may have multiple dual graphs, their graphic matroids are all isomorphic.

==Algorithms==
A minimum weight basis of a graphic matroid is a minimum spanning tree (or minimum spanning forest, if the underlying graph is disconnected). Algorithms for computing minimum spanning trees have been intensively studied; it is known how to solve the problem in linear randomized expected time in a comparison model of computation, or in linear time in a model of computation in which the edge weights are small integers and bitwise operations are allowed on their binary representations. The fastest known time bound that has been proven for a deterministic algorithm is slightly superlinear.

Several authors have investigated algorithms for testing whether a given matroid is graphic. For instance, an algorithm of solves this problem when the input is known to be a binary matroid. solves this problem for arbitrary matroids given access to the matroid only through an independence oracle, a subroutine that determines whether or not a given set is independent.

==Related classes of matroids==
Some classes of matroid have been defined from well-known families of graphs, by phrasing a characterization of these graphs in terms that make sense more generally for matroids. These include the bipartite matroids, in which every circuit is even, and the Eulerian matroids, which can be partitioned into disjoint circuits. A graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if it comes from a bipartite graph and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if it comes from an Eulerian graph. Within the graphic matroids (and more generally within the binary matroids) these two classes are dual: a graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual matroid is Eulerian, and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if its dual matroid is bipartite.

Graphic matroids are one-dimensional rigidity matroids, matroids describing the degrees of freedom of structures of rigid beams that can rotate freely at the vertices where they meet. In one dimension, such a structure has a number of degrees of freedom equal to its number of connected components (the number of vertices minus the matroid rank) and in higher dimensions the number of degrees of freedom of a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional structure with &quot;n&quot; vertices is &quot;dn&quot; minus the matroid rank. In two-dimensional rigidity matroids, the Laman graphs play the role that spanning trees play in graphic matroids, but the structure of rigidity matroids in dimensions greater than two is not well understood.

<text>Anatoly Pavlovich Artsebarsky (, ; born 9 September 1956) is a former Soviet cosmonaut.

He became a cosmonaut in 1985. Artsebarsky spent almost five months in space on a single spaceflight. In 1991, he flew aboard Soyuz TM-12 and docked with the Mir Space Station. Artsebarsky and Sergei Krikalev stayed aboard Mir while the rest of the crew flew back to Earth after eight days. Artsebarsky took six spacewalks during the Mir EO-9 mission. He spent over 33 hours walking in space.

During his stay, Artsebarsky constructed a space tower for use with a control module. Artsebarsky and Krikalev were almost stuck at the station. They were in orbit during the Soviet coup attempt of 1991. For several days, the political situation seriously jeopardised their position.

== Awards ==
* Hero of the Soviet Union
* Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR
* Order of Lenin
* Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot;

==In media==
* Artsebarsky is mentioned in the 2013 movie &quot;Gravity&quot;, because fictional astronaut Matt Kowalski hopes to break Artsebarsky&#x27;s spacewalking record.
* He visited Tehran&#x27;s &quot;Sharif University&quot; together with cosmonaut &quot;Talgat Musabayev&quot; on October 7, 2019.

<doc id="745731" wikidata="Q425295" url="?curid=745731" title="Cisapride">
<text>Cisapride is a gastroprokinetic agent, a drug that increases motility in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It acts directly as a serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist and indirectly as a parasympathomimetic. Stimulation of the serotonin receptors increases acetylcholine release in the enteric nervous system. It has been sold under the trade names Prepulsid (Janssen-Ortho) and Propulsid (in the United States). It was discovered by Janssen Pharmaceuticals in 1980. In many countries, it has been either withdrawn from the market or had its indications limited due to incidence of serious cardiac side-effects. Propulsid was linked to children&#x27;s deaths.

The commercial preparations of this drug are the racemic mixture of both enantiomers of the compound. The (+) enantiomer itself has the major pharmacologic effects and does not induce many of the detrimental side-effects of the mixture.

==Medical uses==
Cisapride has been used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). There is no evidence it is effective for this use in children. It also increases gastric emptying in people with diabetic gastroparesis. Evidence for its use in constipation is not clear.

In many countries, it has been either withdrawn or had its indications limited because of reports of the side-effect long QT syndrome, which may cause arrhythmias. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning letter to doctors, and cisapride was voluntarily removed from the U.S. market on July 14, 2000. Its use in Europe has also been limited. It was banned in India and in the Philippines in 2011.

==Veterinary uses==
Cisapride is still available in the United States and Canada for use in animals, and is commonly prescribed by veterinarians to treat megacolon in cats.

Cisapride is also commonly used to treat GI stasis in rabbits, sometimes in conjunction with metoclopramide (Reglan).

==Kinetics==
Oral bioavailability of cisapride is approximately 33%. It is inactivated primarily by hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 with a half-life of 10 hours. The dose of the drug should be reduced in case of liver diseases.

==Pharmacology and mechanism of action==

As a prokinetic agent that increases gastrointestinal motility, cisapride acts as a selective serotonin agonist in the 5-HT4 receptor subtype. Cisapride also relieves constipation-like symptoms by indirectly stimulating the release of acetylcholine, which acts on muscarinic receptors.

<doc id="745734" wikidata="Q437351" url="?curid=745734" title="Angie Everhart">
<text>Angela Kay Everhart (born September 7, 1969) is an American actress and former model who appeared in several &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issues in the 1990s and posed nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; in 2000.

==Early life==
Everhart was born on September 7, 1969, in Akron, Ohio, the daughter of homemaker Ginnie and engineer Bob Everhart. 

==Career==

As a teenage girl, Everhart became a cover model for such fashion magazines as &quot;Elle&quot; and &quot;Glamour&quot;. Following a horseback riding accident in which she broke her back at the age of 19, Everhart eventually recovered through physical therapy. She appeared in several issues of the annual &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; swimsuit edition, starting in 1995. Everhart posed nude for a cover-featured pictorial in the February 2000 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. She was ranked #98 on the FHM 100 Sexiest Women of 2003.

Everhart made her film debut in 1993 with the Arnold Schwarzenegger action-comedy &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. She later appeared in &quot;Jade&quot; (1995), &quot;Tales From the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood&quot; (1996), &quot;Mad Dog Time&quot; (1996), &quot;Executive Target&quot; (1997), &quot;Another 9½ Weeks&quot; (1997), &quot;Denial&quot; (1998), &quot;Gunblast Vodka&quot; (2000), &quot;The Substitute: Failure Is Not an Option&quot; (2001), &quot;Sexual Predator&quot; (2001), &quot;Bare Witness&quot; (2001), &quot;Wicked Minds&quot; (2003), &quot;Payback&quot; (2006), &quot;Bigfoot&quot; (2008), and &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot; (2011).

She has also appeared on a few TV and reality shows. In 2000, she played a lawyer in &quot;Law and Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. In 2004, she appeared in &quot;Celebrity Mole: Yucatan&quot;, in which she was the &quot;mole&quot;, the rogue agent sabotaging the group. She was one of the &quot;Gingers&quot; on the second season of &quot;The Real Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (the other was Erika Eleniak), but left the show when she accidentally cut her finger severely enough to sever tendons and require surgery. Everhart was also a panelist on &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; from 2000 until 2001 and on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; from 2002 until 2004. Everhart was a co-host on the ABC reality show &quot;The Ex-Wives Club&quot;, along with Marla Maples, and Shar Jackson in 2007.

Everhart&#x27;s long red hair earned her three Crown Awards for &quot;Best Redhead&quot; at the Super-Hair.Net website from 2005 to 2007. She also represented the United States in two Super-Hair World Cup tournaments, winning the championship through online votes in both 2006 and 2010.

On February 28, 2012, Everhart began co-hosting the weekly live podcast &quot;Hot N Heavy&quot; with The Greg Wilson on the Toad Hop Network. It is recorded at Jon Lovitz Comedy Club &amp; Podcast Theatre.

==Personal life==

Everhart was married to Ashley Hamilton from December 1, 1996, until their divorce in March 1997. Sylvester Stallone and Everhart were briefly engaged in 1995, but they never married. She was engaged to Joe Pesci, but the couple broke up in 2008.

She gave birth to her son Kayden Bobby Everhart, in 2009, with her ex-boyfriend Chad Stansbury.

She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had surgery on May 14, 2013. A representative of hers said, &quot;[Angie] wants to set the record straight by letting everyone know that it is true that she has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer, however, the prognosis is very good.&quot; She filed for bankruptcy due to medical expenses from thyroid cancer treatment.

She married Carl Ferro, founder of meal delivery service Sunfare.com, in 2014. Everhart filed for divorce from Ferro in 2018, citing irreconcilable differences. 

In October 2017, Everhart accused Harvey Weinstein of masturbating in front of her at the Venice Film Festival when they were staying on the same boat. She said she was sleeping and awoke to Weinstein standing over her bed. She said she tried to leave, but Weinstein blocked the door. Despite his telling her not to tell anyone, Everhart said she did tell others, but that no one would do anything since they were terrified of Weinstein.

Once a skydiving enthusiast, she gave up the activity following an accident in which she was injured badly enough to require back surgery.

She is fluent in French.

<doc id="745743" wikidata="Q568384" url="?curid=745743" title="Mirinda">
<text>Mirinda ( ) is a brand of soft drink that was created in Spain in 1959 and has been distributed globally by PepsiCo since 1970. Its name comes from the Esperanto translation of &quot;admirable&quot; or &quot;amazing&quot;.

It is available in many fruit varieties, like orange, apple, strawberry, among others. It is part of a beverage area often referred to as the flavour segment, comprising carbonated and non-carbonated fruit-flavoured beverages. The orange flavour of Mirinda now represents the majority of Mirinda sales worldwide following a major repositioning of the brand towards that flavour in the early 1990s.

American beverage company PepsiCo acquired the Mirinda brand in 1970 and markets it primarily outside the United States. It competes with The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s Fanta and Dr Pepper Snapple Group&#x27;s Crush with flavour brands localized to individual countries. Mirinda is available in multiple formulations of flavour, carbonation and sweetener depending on the taste of individual markets.

== Names ==
Mirinda, being a drink with presence around the world, is also known with many other names: Sukita (Brazil), Yedigun (Turkey), Slam (Italy), Kas (Spain), Frustyle (Russia since 2022), Sol (some US states).

== History ==

Mirinda was first produced in Spain. It became available in the United States in late 2003 in bilingual packaging, and was sold at a reduced price, becoming a competitor against Coca-Cola&#x27;s Fanta brand. Since 2005, Mirinda flavours have largely been sold under the Tropicana Twister Soda brand in the United States except in Guam, where Pepsi began selling it under the Mirinda brand in 2007 (replacing Chamorro Punch Orange). 

PepsiCo also tried to sell Mirinda in Brazil in late 1996, but the brand was discontinued in 1998 after weak sales, keeping the local brand &quot;Sukita&quot; under production. 

In Italy, it was sold under the brand Slam until 2021, when it was renamed.

== Advertising and recent events ==
Mirinda campaigns over the years have included the &quot;Mirinda Woman&quot; campaign in the 1970s. The &quot;Mirinda Craver&quot; ads produced by Jim Henson from 1975 to 1978 involved a monster called the Mirinda Craver (performed by Bob Payne and voiced by Allen Swift) craving the Mirinda drinks and doing anything to obtain one. With the Mirinda Craver being a live-hand Muppet, Payne was assisted in performing the Mirinda Craver by Louise Gold, Dave Holman, or Faz Fazakas, handling one of the arms, moving eyes and twirling hair of the Mirinda Craver.
A campaign between 1994 and 1996 used the tag-line &quot;The Taste is in Mirinda&quot; with the Blue Man Group. In some markets, including Mexico, the Blue Man Group campaign re-launched Mirinda away from a multi-flavour positioning to a brand solely focused on the orange flavour. The Blue Man Group campaign showed the Blue Man Group competing to drink orange Mirinda and celebrating a successful drink with an open-mouth exclamation of &#x27;Mirindaaaa&#x27;. Also in Mexico, Mirinda launched a campaign with the Pokémon anime series aimed at children with a promotion of gadgets with the characters of the manga series.

Mirinda advertising campaigns have been handled by Pepsi&#x27;s stable of creative agencies, including BBDO and J. Walter Thompson.

Mirinda regularly introduces special movie-themed editions in Asia. Recent ones included Batman (blueberry) and Superman (fruit punch). Mirinda has also recently released a new flavour of drinks called Mirinda creme. They come in three flavours: mango, raspberry and lime.

Mirinda was briefly sold in Australia during the 1990s. In the 1990s, KFC in Australia switched from the Coca-Cola to the Pepsi family of soft drinks. It then sold Mirinda Orange and Mirinda Lemon, before later changing to Sunkist and Solo when the Australian Pepsi bottler gained the rights to the Schweppes/Dr Pepper brands. In the 2010s and 2020s, Mirinda syrups were available at Big W department stores.

Mirinda is no longer sold in New Zealand, replaced with the introduction of PepsiCo&#x27;s new Mountain Dew range of similar flavours (Code Red, Live Wire, Pitch Black, Electro Shock and Passionfruit Frenzy).

== Mirinda as a name ==

<text>Sportclub Heerenveen (; West Frisian: Sportklub It Hearrenfean) is a Dutch professional football club from Heerenveen. They currently play in the Eredivisie, the top level of football in the Netherlands. The club is known for its Frisian identity.

==History==
Sportclub Heerenveen was founded on 20 July 1920 in the town of Heerenveen, Friesland, as Athleta. It changed name twice, first to Spartaan and then to v.v. Heerenveen in 1922. While the Netherlands was occupied by Germany, Heerenveen won three successive North of the Netherlands championships, and following the end of World War II it went on to win the same title six times in a row; the club&#x27;s dominance partly ascribed to the presence of Abe Lenstra. During this period, Lenstra led Heerenveen to a famous victory over Ajax in one of the most noted games in Dutch domestic football history. Trailing 5–1 with 25 minutes remaining, the Frisian team inexplicably fought back for a 6–5 victory.

During the 1950s, Heerenveen regional dominance faded and after Dutch football turned professional Lenstra left to join Sportclub Enschede, before the club he departed was relegated to the Tweede Divisie. By the end of the decade, Heerenveen was in the Eerste Divisie, but found itself relegated again. In 1969–70, the Frisian club won the Tweede Divisie to return to the Eerste Divisie and for two seasons in the 1970s, the club was close to achieving promotion to the top-flight Eredivisie. By 1974, the club was in financial trouble and to ensure its survival it was split into amateur and professional sections on 1 June 1977, the professional part being renamed sc Heerenveen.

In the 1980s, Heerenveen twice made the promotion playoffs, but were unsuccessful both times. It finally reached the Eredivisie in 1990, becoming the first Frisian club to reach the top level, at the expense of near-neighbours Cambuur. The achievement was overseen by Frisian coach Foppe de Haan. Heerenveen&#x27;s first season in the Netherlands&#x27; top division was not at all successful and it was relegated, before returning in 1993, though they reached the final of the KNVB Cup while still an Eerste Divisie club. Having established itself as a top-flight club, Heerenveen moved to a new stadium, named after their most celebrated player, the Abe Lenstra Stadion, and reached the final of the KNVB Cup for a second time. The 1998 semi-final in the cup competition was lost to Ajax. Because Ajax and the other finalist, PSV, had both qualified for the cup final, a decision match was needed to fill in the vacant spot for the next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Heerenveen had to play against the other losing semi-finalist, Twente. Heerenveen won that match in which Ruud van Nistelrooy scored his last goal for Heerenveen. The match ended 3–1.

Heerenveen became regular competitors in the UEFA Cup, and in 1999–2000 finished second in the Eredivisie, its highest ever finish, and qualified for the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League.

The club was led from 1983 until September 2006 by president Riemer van der Velde, the longest tenure of any president with a professional club in the Netherlands. As the results of recent transfers that include Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Afonso Alves, Michael Bradley, Miralem Sulejmani, Petter Hansson and Danijel Pranjić (and earlier players like Jon Dahl Tomasson, Marcus Allbäck, Erik Edman, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Igor Korneev and Daniel Jensen), Heerenveen is one of the most financially secure Eredivisie clubs. A 2010 report by the Dutch football association showed that Heerenveen is the only Eredivisie club that has a financially secure budget. Under the tenure of Trond Sollied, Heerenveen won its first KNVB Cup, also its first ever major trophy. Trond Sollied, however, was sacked on 31 August 2009 due to a weak opening of the season and a conflict with the board.

On 17 May 2009, the club defeated Twente 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out to win the Dutch Cup for the first time after a 2–2 draw in the final, with Gerald Sibon scoring the winning penalty. On 13 February 2012, it was announced that Marco van Basten would replace Ron Jans, who had led Heerenveen for two years, as team manager for the 2012–13 season..

==Stadium==
The club plays its home matches at the Abe Lenstra Stadium, which opened in 1994 and holds 26,100 people. Before that, the team played at a ground with the same name elsewhere in the town, but it could not meet the increasing popularity of the club. Throughout the years, the club developed several plans to further expand the stadium. One of the plans was to extend at least one side stand towards the pitch, as seen in English football stadiums. Due to deteriorating league results and financial limitedness, however, those plans were shelved. It is uncertain whether or not the club will ever carry them out. Before the move to the Abe Lenstra Stadion, Heerenveen played at the Sportpark Noord. The club&#x27;s training facilities are regarded as world class, which is said to be a major factor in their recruitment of younger players. The name of the clubs facilities is sportpark . The facilities are shared with VV Heerenveen and sc Heerenveen (women).

==Colours, crest and anthem==
The crest on the club emblem is the symbol of the flag of Friesland. The flag of Friesland is based on the arms of the 15th century. The stripes and &quot;seeblatt&quot; shapes represent the districts of Friesland.

A unique tradition in the Dutch Eredivisie is that the Frisian national anthem is played and sung before every domestic match. UEFA does not allow this tradition in European matches. Nevertheless, the anthem is sung by the supporters anyway.

==Rivalry==

=== SC Cambuur ===
Heerenveen retain a very fierce rivalry with SC Cambuur. One of the reasons of the rivalry is the short distance between the two clubs. Because of that the clubs often refer to each other as DKV which stands for Dertig Kilometer Verderop (Thirty Kilometers Away) so that they do not have to mention each other&#x27;s names. However, the biggest and also the most confusing reason is the background of the clubs. Many people who aren&#x27;t involved in the rivalry find it difficult to understand. Most of the Heerenveen fans are from small villages from the entire province (and even outside it) and are very proud of their Frisian identity. Since the 80&#x27;s the club have been expressing this Frisian pride to the rest of the Netherlands. The Frisian flag, the Frisian anthem, all Frisian symbols were linked to the club, which made Heerenveen the face of Frisia. Because of this Cambuur slowly disappeared in the shadow of Heerenveen, as a reaction to this Cambuur fans started distancing themselves from the Frisian identity. Nowadays Cambuur do not consider themselves Frisian even though they are from the capital of the province. They now call themselves Leeuwarders aka people from the city. Heerenveen fans are mockingly called boeren (farmers) because Heerenveen isn&#x27;t a city and the fans mainly live in small villages. Because of the successes of Heerenveen and the meager performances of Cambuur including almost going bankrupt, the rivalry was almost forgotten. When Cambuur got promoted back to the Eredivisie in 2013 by winning the 2012/13 season of the Jupiler League the rivalry got revived. Before the meeting on 29 September 2013 the game hadn&#x27;t been played for 13 years, giving Cambuur a great opportunity to prove themselves. Heerenveen won that game 2–1. The away game later in the season was won 3–1 by Cambuur.

===FC Groningen===
The absence of Cambuur caused FC Groningen to be the nearest Eredivisie team and soon it became rivals with Heerenveen. Strikingly, both northern sides used to maintain more or less of a friendship in the past. Therefore, this Northern Derby rivalry is only based on geographical location. Because most Heerenveen fans have always considered Cambuur as main rivals, this derby is often referred to as a surrogate derby. Days before the game, Heerenveen and Groningen fans tease each other by means of playful actions, usually with no violence. Heerenveen fans once stole the centre spot from Stadion Oosterpark, and raised the Frisian flag at the Martinitoren, the highest tower in Groningen, combined with a banner saying &quot;&quot;SCH op eenzame hoogte&quot; (SCH on lonely height)&quot;. The front yard of a Groningen chairman once got filled with rubble from a construction site. This was because the construction of the Euroborg had to be halted due to a major design mistake. Groningen fans countered by painting a statue of all-time Heerenveen hero Abe Lenstra green and white, the colours of Groningen. They also transformed a viaduct near Heerenveen to green and white.

A year later, in the 2001–02 season, Groningen fans awarded Heerenveen player Anthony Lurling the title of &quot;Biggest cheat of the season&quot; and handed him therefore a sewing machine. In that same week the town signs of Heerenveen were changed to &quot;Hoerenveen It Sucks&quot; (&quot;Whore&quot;-veen) by the Groningen supporters. The following season, Groningen fans teased the Heerenveen following again, this time by establishing a border post on the border of Groningen and Friesland.

<text>During the history of Canadian politics, thirteen minority governments have been elected at the federal level. There have also been two minority governments resulting from governments being replaced between elections, for a total of fifteen federal minority governments in thirteen separate minority parliaments. There have been historical cases where the governing party had fewer than half of the seats but had the support of independents who called themselves members of the party; these cases are not included, as there was never any serious chance of the government falling.

In a minority situation, governments must rely on the support of other parties to stay in power, providing less stability than a majority government. At the federal level, no minority government (excepting the odd case of the 14th) has lasted a standard four-year term. Most minority governments have lasted less than two years. The average duration of completed minorities in Canada is 479 days or approximately 1 year, 140 days counting only that part of the 14th Parliament that was a minority, or 1 year, 207 days counting the entire duration of it.

In addition to the minorities below, the 2nd Canadian Parliament was a minority for 56 days under prime minister Alexander Mackenzie after he took power from John A. Macdonald following the Pacific Scandal. However, this event is generally not noted because Parliament was never in session while Mackenzie was in power. The fifteenth federal minority parliament was elected in the 2021 election.

In the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world, minority governments are referred to as hung parliaments.

==Alexander Mackenzie==
Alexander Mackenzie replaced John A. Macdonald in 1873 after the latter was involved in the Pacific Scandal. Mackenzie became the prime minister of a minority government, but he immediately called an election in which he then won a majority.

==William Lyon Mackenzie King==

*Seats short of a majority 1921: 0. Term of office 1,339 days. (Due to seat fluctuations, the government was not in a minority for the entire duration of the parliament.)
*Seats short of a majority 1925: 23. Term of office 204 days.

Liberal minority after the 1921 election. Initially, the Liberal Party had the exact number of seats required for a majority. It maintained that majority until December 1923 when it lost two seats in by-elections returning it to a minority. It continued as a minority until November 1924 when the Liberals gained a seat in a by-election and became a majority again. Therefore, although this particular Parliament lasted for 3 years and 7 months, for only about half of that time (one year and ten months) was it an actual minority Parliament.

Liberal minority after the 1925 election- This was a truly minority Parliament throughout its life. The election resulted in the incumbent Liberal government of Mackenzie King being reduced to 101 seats in the House of Commons, while the opposition Conservatives took the most seats (116). All others won 26 seats, 24 of them won by the Progressives. King chose to carry on in government and face the new Parliament seeking its confidence. From January to July 1926, King&#x27;s government sustained such confidence with the support of most of the Progressives (although in many cases only by one or two votes). On June 26, after virtually losing control of the House and sustaining a loss on a sub-amendment to a censure motion and facing a final vote on the main censure motion, King asked the Governor-General for dissolution and was refused. King therefore immediately resigned and the Conservative leader Arthur Meighen agreed to form a government which itself, although larger, was also a minority one. However, a few days later on July 1, 1926, the new Meighen minority government was defeated on a matter of confidence (by one vote). Meighen then requested and obtained a dissolution from the Governor-General. Therefore, the Parliament arising from this election was throughout a minority one.

===Quasi-minorities===
After the 1926 election, the Liberal party proper was seven seats short of a majority. However, eight MPs were elected as Liberal-Progressive members and usually voted with the Liberals giving the government a working majority.

As well, following the 1945 election the official Liberal candidates did not win a majority of seats leaving the King government five seats short of a majority. However, the election of eight &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; MPs, most of whom did not run as official Liberals because of their opposition to conscription (see Conscription Crisis of 1944), as well as one Liberal-Progressive, gave the King government an effective working majority in parliament. Most of the Independent Liberal MPs joined (or re-joined) the Liberal caucus following World War II when the conscription issue became moot.

==Arthur Meighen==

*Seats short of a majority 1926: 8. Term of office 88 days.
Arthur Meighen led two short-lived Conservative governments. The first was a majority at the end of the 13th parliament, elected in 1917 under the Unionist ticket. The second government was a minority in 1926. Meighen&#x27;s conservatives won a plurality of the seats in the previous 1925 election, however, a government was instead formed via an agreement between the Liberals and Progressives. After King&#x27;s Liberals had lost the progressives&#x27; support he requested parliament to be dissolved by the governor-general, Lord Byng, resulting in the King–Byng Affair. The resulting conflict caused King to shortly resign as prime minister, and Byng subsequently appointed Meighen as prime minister. On July 1, 1926, a week after Byng appointed him prime minister, Meighen lost a confidence vote in the House of Commons resulting in the 1926 election.

1Not elected as such

==John Diefenbaker==
*Seats short of a majority 1957: 22. Term of office 177 days.
*Seats short of a majority 1962: 17. Term of office 203 days.
After 22 years of Liberal rule, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, led by John Diefenbaker, unexpectedly won a minority government in the 1957 election. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, sensing the mood of the nation, stepped aside and let Diefenbaker govern. Diefenbaker needed the support of the Social Credit Party of Canada and three independents to get any legislation passed. This minority lasted only a few months. The seminal moment was Lester Pearson announcing to Diefenbaker that because of the slight decline in economic performance, and the fact that the Liberals had won the popular vote, he should hand power back to the Liberals. Diefenbaker, in a rage, launched a two-hour speech condemning the Liberals, and revealing a document from the previous government predicting the economic decline. Diefenbaker would soon call an election, and win the largest majority government in Canadian history.

The Diefenbaker government ended badly with party infighting, a poor economy and controversies over relations with the United States during the Kennedy administration. In the 1962 election, the Tories won only a minority. This time, the momentum was with the Liberals and the imploding Tories were all but incapable of governing due largely to a split in Diefenbaker&#x27;s Cabinet over the deployment of Bomarc missiles in Canada. The government was defeated in the House on a confidence issue on February 5, 1963, forcing the 1963 federal election which the Tories lost.

==Lester B. Pearson==
*Seats short of a majority 1963: 5. Term of office 2 year, 123 days (854 days).
*Seats short of a majority 1965: 2. Term of office 2 years, 136 days (866 days).
In the 1963 election, the Liberals, led by Lester B. Pearson, were also unable to win a majority. The next 548 days were productive ones, however, a close working relationship between the Liberals and the New Democratic Party (NDP) resulted in the introduction of Canada&#x27;s health care system, the Canadian flag, and the Canada Pension Plan. In 1965, Pearson asked the Governor General to dissolve Parliament in an attempt to win a majority, but the makeup of parliament after the 1965 election remained almost the same, leading to almost three more years of a productive alliance between the Liberals and NDP.

Canada&#x27;s constitutional convention dealing with minority governments was altered in 1968 when Pearson&#x27;s government was unexpectedly defeated on a matter of confidence. While this should have led to an immediate dissolution of parliament, none of the parties were ready, and Pearson was in the process of being replaced as leader of the Liberals. By mutual agreement among the party leaders, a new motion was passed that retroactively declared that the budgetary matter on which the government was defeated was not a matter of confidence, setting a new precedent.

==Pierre E. Trudeau==

*Seats short of a majority 1972: 232. Term of office 1 year, 170 days (535 days).
In the 1972 election, the Liberals under Pierre Trudeau won only two seats more than the Tories. It was the second election for Trudeau as party leader. However, even though the Liberals entered the election strong in the polls, the Trudeaumania buzz had all but ended, and the party was further damaged by a weak economy. With few issues to campaign on and one of the weakest campaigns in Canadian history, they were again forced to rely on the NDP to remain in power. In this instance, the NDP demanded the creation of Petro-Canada among other things to support the Liberals. The government fell on May 8, 1974, on a sub-amendment to the budget (thus a question of confidence). The Trudeau Liberals won a large majority government in the resulting 1974 federal election.

2Speaker was elected as independent

==Joe Clark==

*Seats short of a majority 1979: 6. Term of office 186 days.
To improve his situation slightly, Clark supported the selection of Liberal member James Jerome, House Speaker in the 30th Parliament, to serve as speaker once again, and this was seconded by Opposition Leader Pierre Trudeau. (Starting in 1986, the speaker was elected in a secret ballot vote by the members of the house.)

While the Liberals had first the Progressives and later the NDP to support them in minority situations, the Progressive Conservatives had little experience attracting support as a minority government. Seven months after the 1979 election which ended 11 years of Trudeau Liberal government, the Tory government of Joe Clark was defeated in motion of no confidence in the government and its budget moved by Bob Rae of the NDP and supported by the Liberals.

Clark might have prevented this defeat had his government agreed to support the Quebec based Social Credit Party in its bid to maintain official party status—the party&#x27;s seat total had fallen to six seats as a result of the 1979 election. However, Clark had hoped to follow the precedent set by Diefenbaker and pledged to &quot;govern as if&quot; he had a majority and then advance to a majority government through a new election without having to make deals with smaller parties. He also wished to win seats in Quebec in his own right and saw the conservative, populist Social Credit Party as an obstacle rather than a potential partner. As a result of Clark&#x27;s refusal to extend recognition to Social Credit, its MPs abstained in the Non-Confidence vote that brought down the Clark government on December 13, 1979, a defeat caused by the Social Credit abstention and the absence of a handful of Tory MPs due to illness or travel. The dissolution was portrayed as a blunder and the budget Clark fought 1980 election on was unpopular with voters. On February 18, 1980, the PCs were defeated by the Trudeau Liberals who were elected to a majority government.

==Paul Martin==

*Seats short of a majority 2004: 20. Term of office 1 year, 133 days (498 days).
Although the 2004 federal election was initially expected to be easy for Martin to win a fourth consecutive Liberal majority government, during the campaign many began instead to predict a far closer result. Mostly due to the sponsorship scandal, polls started to indicate the possibility of a minority government for the Liberals, or even a minority Conservative government, which in turn created speculation of coalitions with the other parties. Towards the end of the campaign, the Liberals were running attack ads against the Conservatives. In the end, the Liberals fared better than the final opinion polls had led them to fear, but not well enough to win a majority.

On May 10, 2005, a motion was passed by the opposition parties in the House of Commons to instruct a committee to call for the dissolution of the government. The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois defeated the Liberals and the NDP by 153 votes to 150. Although the motion was technically nothing more than a procedural instruction to a committee, the Conservatives and Bloc demanded the resignation of the government. There is ongoing debate between parties and constitutional experts as to whether or not this was a vote of no confidence.

On May 19, 2005, the House voted on two budget bills, deemed unquestionable matters of confidence. With the support of two independents and Conservative MP Belinda Stronach—who crossed the floor to the Liberals and was appointed Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, becoming a member of the Liberal cabinet—the result of the vote was a tie, which was broken in favour of the government by the Speaker of the House of Commons, resulting in a vote of 153–152.

On November 24, 2005, the opposition Conservatives introduced a motion of no confidence. The motion was seconded by the NDP. On November 28, the government was defeated by a margin of 171 to 133, having been defeated by the united opposition forces (Conservatives, NDP, and Bloc Québécois). In the early morning of November 29, 2005, Martin went to Governor General Michaëlle Jean to ask for the dissolution of parliament and a January 23, 2006, election.

==Stephen Harper==
* Seats short of a majority 2006: 31. Term of office 2 years, 207 days (937 days).
* Seats short of a majority 2008: 12. Term of office 2 years, 142 days (872 days).

Although several public opinion polls predicted that the 2006 election would result in either a strong Conservative minority or a slight majority, the Liberals enjoyed a last-minute surge but were unable to overtake the Conservatives. However, the surge did result in the 2nd smallest minority government in Canadian history with the smallest percentage of government seats ever and the largest number of seats short of a majority until the government of Justin Trudeau in 2021. All parties held the balance of power, the Liberal party with 102 seats, the Bloc Québécois with 51 seats, and the NDP with 29 seats. André Arthur, a popular radio host from Quebec City, was the only independent elected. As Liberal Peter Milliken was reelected as Speaker, the Conservatives now effectively held a minority only 29 seats short of a majority as the Speaker traditionally votes only to break a tie and always in favour of the status quo. Thus, the Conservatives held a majority together with any one of the opposition parties, assuming no defections. This status was changed midway through the 39th parliament when maverick MP Garth Turner was ousted from the Conservative caucus for allegedly violating &quot;caucus confidentiality&quot;.

Stephen Harper led a minority Conservative government and was sworn in as Prime Minister on February 6. Paul Martin resigned as leader of the Liberal Party on March 18 to quell any rumours that he might run in any future election. From March 18 to December 2, 2006, Bill Graham was the interim leader of the Liberal party. Stéphane Dion won the leadership convention on December 2, and from then served as the leader of the opposition.

The initial results of the 2006 election indicated that the Conservatives would fall 31 seats short of a majority. However, after the election but before the new Parliament took office, Liberal David Emerson crossed the floor to join the Conservatives and Stephen Harper&#x27;s cabinet amidst some controversy. This increased the size of the Conservative caucus to 125 seats, only 30 seats short of a majority.

The 39th Parliament was dissolved on September 7, 2008, ending the longest-running minority government between the return of writs and dissolution. On October 14, Harper&#x27;s Conservative Party was re-elected with a plurality of seats, though still 12 seats short of a majority. It is the first time since Pearson&#x27;s 1965 minority that a minority government was re-elected as such.

The 40th Parliament was dissolved following the government&#x27;s defeat in a motion of no confidence, however, the Conservatives were re-elected to a majority government on May 2, 2011. Excluding the odd case of the 14th Parliament, Harper led the government through two longest-lasting federal minority governments in Canadian history and was also the first prime minister to win a federal election (by majority or minority) after winning two minority governments (consecutive or not).

==Justin Trudeau==
* Seats short of a majority 2019: 13. Term of office 1 year, 253 days (619 days). He won 157 seats, 13 seats away from a majority.
* Seats short of a majority 2021: 10. Term of office ( days) &quot;(as of )&quot;. He won 160 seats, 10 seats away from a majority. He currently serves his third mandate as Prime Minister of Canada.
In the 2019 election, the Liberals under Justin Trudeau won the most seats, though still 13 seats short of a majority, and formed a minority government. It was the second election for Trudeau as party leader. 

The 43rd Parliament was dissolved on August 15, 2021. On September 20, Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal Party was re-elected, though still 10 seats short of a majority, and formed a second minority government. It is the first time since Harper&#x27;s 2008 minority that a minority government was re-elected as such. The New Democratic Party (NDP) agreed to a confidence and supply agreement with the Liberals from March 22, 2022, to September 4, 2024.

<text>Charles Richard Cross (May 7, 1957 – August 9, 2024) was an American music journalist, author and editor who was based in Seattle. He documented the Seattle music scene as the editor of &quot;The Rocket&quot; in Seattle from 1986–2000. 

Cross wrote three &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselllers, including the award-winning 2001 biography of Kurt Cobain, &quot;Heavier Than Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Room Full of Mirrors: A Biography of Jimi Hendrix,&quot; which &quot;Vibe&quot; described as &quot;one of the greatest-ever books on music&quot;. In addition to writing the 1989 Bruce Springsteen biography, &quot;Backstreets: Springsteen, the Man and His Music,&quot; he founded &quot;Backstreets Magazine&quot;, a periodical for Sprinsteen fans. 

In 2004, while conducting research for the Hendrix biography, Cross discovered the gravesite of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s mother, Lucille Jeter Hendrix, in an abandoned section of Greenwood Memorial Park, where Jimi Hendrix was buried. Her gravesite was lost because the standard welfare marker of her day, an inscribed brick, was buried in decades of mud. 

Cross died in Shoreline, Washington on August 9, 2024, at the age of 67.

<doc id="745789" wikidata="Q1934099" url="?curid=745789" title="Subadditivity">
<text>In mathematics, subadditivity is a property of a function that states, roughly, that evaluating the function for the sum of two elements of the domain always returns something less than or equal to the sum of the function&#x27;s values at each element. There are numerous examples of subadditive functions in various areas of mathematics, particularly norms and square roots. Additive maps are special cases of subadditive functions.

==Definitions==
A subadditive function is a function formula_1, having a domain &quot;A&quot; and an ordered codomain &quot;B&quot; that are both closed under addition, with the following property:
formula_2

An example is the square root function, having the non-negative real numbers as domain and codomain:
since formula_3 we have:
formula_4

A sequence formula_5 is called subadditive if it satisfies the inequality
formula_6
for all &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. This is a special case of subadditive function, if a sequence is interpreted as a function on the set of natural numbers.

Note that while a concave sequence is subadditive, the converse is false. For example, randomly assign formula_7 with values in formula_8; then the sequence is subadditive but not concave.

==Properties==

===Sequences===
A useful result pertaining to subadditive sequences is the following lemma due to Michael Fekete.

_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the limit formula_9 is equal to the infimum formula_10. (The limit may be formula_11.)}}

{n_k} &gt; s^* + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all formula_12. 

Since formula_13, there exists an formula_14 such that formula_15.

By infinitary pigeonhole principle, there exists a sub-subsequence formula_16, whose indices all belong to the same residue class modulo formula_17, and so they advance by multiples of formula_17. This sequence, continued for long enough, would be forced by subadditivity to dip below the formula_19 slope line, a contradiction. 

In more detail, by subadditivity, we have

formula_20

which implies formula_21, a contradiction.

The analogue of Fekete&#x27;s lemma holds for superadditive sequences as well, that is:
formula_22 (The limit then may be positive infinity: consider the sequence formula_23.)

There are extensions of Fekete&#x27;s lemma that do not require the inequality formula_24 to hold for all &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, but only for &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; such that formula_25 

, ...&lt;/math&gt; are forced down as in the previous proof. }}

Moreover, the condition formula_24 may be weakened as follows: formula_27 provided that formula_28 is an increasing function such that the integral formula_29 converges (near the infinity).

There are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of convergence to the limit whose existence is stated in Fekete&#x27;s lemma if some kind of both superadditivity and subadditivity is present.

Besides, analogues of Fekete&#x27;s lemma have been proved for subadditive real maps (with additional assumptions) from finite subsets of an amenable group 
and further, of a cancellative left-amenable semigroup.

===Functions===
If &quot;f&quot; is a subadditive function, and if 0 is in its domain, then &quot;f&quot;(0) ≥ 0. To see this, take the inequality at the top. formula_30. Hence formula_31

A concave function formula_32 with formula_33 is also subadditive.
To see this, one first observes that formula_34.
Then looking at the sum of this bound for formula_35 and formula_36, will finally verify that &quot;f&quot; is subadditive.

The negative of a subadditive function is superadditive.
==Examples in various domains==

===Entropy===

Entropy plays a fundamental role in information theory and statistical physics, as well as in quantum mechanics in a generalized formulation due to von Neumann.
Entropy appears always as a subadditive quantity in all of its formulations, meaning the entropy of a supersystem or a set union of random variables is always less or equal than the sum of the entropies of its individual components.
Additionally, entropy in physics satisfies several more strict inequalities such as the Strong Subadditivity of Entropy in classical statistical mechanics and its quantum analog.

===Economics===

Subadditivity is an essential property of some particular cost functions. It is, generally, a necessary and sufficient condition for the verification of a natural monopoly. It implies that production from only one firm is socially less expensive (in terms of average costs) than production of a fraction of the original quantity by an equal number of firms.

Economies of scale are represented by subadditive average cost functions.

Except in the case of complementary goods, the price of goods (as a function of quantity) must be subadditive. Otherwise, if the sum of the cost of two items is cheaper than the cost of the bundle of two of them together, then nobody would ever buy the bundle, effectively causing the price of the bundle to &quot;become&quot; the sum of the prices of the two separate items. Thus proving that it is not a sufficient condition for a natural monopoly; since the unit of exchange may not be the actual cost of an item. This situation is familiar to everyone in the political arena where some minority asserts that the loss of some particular freedom at some particular level of government means that many governments are better; whereas the majority assert that there is some other correct unit of cost.

===Finance===
Subadditivity is one of the desirable properties of coherent risk measures in risk management. The economic intuition behind risk measure subadditivity is that a portfolio risk exposure should, at worst, simply equal the sum of the risk exposures of the individual positions that compose the portfolio. The lack of subadditivity is one of the main critiques of VaR models which do not rely on the assumption of normality of risk factors. The Gaussian VaR ensures subadditivity: for example, the Gaussian VaR of a two unitary long positions portfolio formula_37 at the confidence level formula_38 is, assuming that the mean portfolio value variation is zero and the VaR is defined as a negative loss,
formula_39
where formula_40 is the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution function at probability level formula_41, formula_42 are the individual positions returns variances and formula_43 is the linear correlation measure between the two individual positions returns. Since variance is always positive,
formula_44
Thus the Gaussian VaR is subadditive for any value of formula_45 and, in particular, it equals the sum of the individual risk exposures when formula_46 which is the case of no diversification effects on portfolio risk.

===Thermodynamics===
Subadditivity occurs in the thermodynamic properties of non-ideal solutions and mixtures like the excess molar volume and heat of mixing or excess enthalpy.

===Combinatorics on words===
A factorial language formula_47 is one where if a word is in formula_47, then all factors of that word are also in formula_47. In combinatorics on words, a common problem is to determine the number formula_50 of length-formula_51 words in a factorial language. Clearly formula_52, so formula_53 is subadditive, and hence Fekete&#x27;s lemma can be used to estimate the growth of formula_50.

For every formula_55, sample two strings of length formula_51 uniformly at random on the alphabet formula_57. The expected length of the longest common subsequence is a &quot;super&quot;-additive function of formula_51, and thus there exists a number formula_59, such that the expected length grows as formula_60. By checking the case with formula_61, we easily have formula_62. The exact value of even formula_63, however, is only known to be between 0.788 and 0.827.

<doc id="745791" wikidata="Q8022769" url="?curid=745791" title="Wilmington Oil Field">
<text>The Wilmington Oil Field is a prolific petroleum field in Los Angeles County in southern California in the United States. Discovered in 1932, it is the third largest oil field in the United States in terms of cumulative oil production. The field runs roughly southeast to northwest through the Los Angeles Basin, stretching from the middle of San Pedro Bay through Long Beach and east of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The field originally contained approximately of reserves. In 2013, the USGS estimated future potential production from the combined Wilmington-Belmont oilfield could be around .

The offshore portion of the oil field is developed largely through wells drilled directionally from THUMS Islands, four artificial islands in Long Beach Harbor.

==Operations==
California Resources Corporation currently operates the Wilmington Oil Field in partnership with the State of California and the City of Long Beach. CRC&#x27;s Long Beach operations include:
*&quot;THUMS Long Beach Company&quot;, which operates the offshore portion of the Wilmington Oil Field
*&quot;Tidelands Oil Production Company&quot;, which operates the onshore portion of the Wilmington Oil Field
*two additional smaller leases in the Long Beach area

==Data==
Estimations as of 2013 (based on reserve estimates in 2008 and extraction from succeeding years, estimated through July).
* cumulative production: 
* estimated reserves: 
* annual production: 
* producing wells: 1,428 (in 2008)
* estimated year of depletion (based on current rates and reserve estimates): 2031

A 2013 USGS report estimates that the Wilmington-Belmont oilfield had Original oil-in-place of between of oil, of which an additional could be produced, with their best estimate of future production potential. 

==Geology==
The field was discovered with the Ranger Petroleum Corp.&#x27;s Watson No. 2 well in 1932, which flowed at 150 bbl per day, and the broad anticline structure itself was discovered in 1936 by the General Petroleum Corp.&#x27;s Terminal No. 1 well based on a Reflection seismology survey. An offshore seismic survey in 1954 showed the field extended some miles to the southeast. The anticline plunges to the northwest and is separated from the Torrance Oil Field by a saddle, and is similarly separated from the Huntington Beach Oil Field to the southeast. A series of transform faults divides the field into separate blocks which form barriers to fluid movement and pressure changes. Basement consists of the Catalina Schist and is overlain with up to 8,000 feet of Miocene and Pliocene sediments, the main oil producing zones being the Puente and Repetto sandstones. An unconformity in the Pliocene between the Repetto and the Pico indicates the top of the structure was eroded to a flat surface and later Pliocene and Holocene sediments were deposited horizontally.

===Subsidence===
Withdrawal of large volumes of oil from the poorly consolidated sediments resulted in compaction of the oil reservoirs, and resultant sinking of the overlying land surface. Subsidence became apparent in 1940, and exceeded 20 feet at the center. Water injection to maintain pressure in the oil reservoirs began in 1953, which eventually stopped further subsidence.

<text>The Battle of Thymbra was the decisive battle in the war between Croesus of the Lydian Kingdom and Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire. Cyrus, after he had pursued Croesus into Lydia after the drawn Battle of Pteria, met the remains of Croesus&#x27; partially-disbanded army in battle on the plain north of Sardis in December 547 BC. Croesus&#x27; army was about twice as large and had been reinforced with many new men, but Cyrus still utterly defeated it. That proved to be decisive, and after the 14-day Siege of Sardis, the city and possibly its king fell, and Lydia was conquered by the Persians.

==Background==

Cyrus conquered the Kingdom of Media in 550 BC, which created conflict with the neighboring Lydian Kingdom. Cyrus planned to catch the Lydian king unprepared for battle, but at Thymbra, Croesus had more than twice as many men as Cyrus. The Lydians marched out to meet Cyrus and quickly armed all the reserves there before their allies could arrive, which they never did. According to Xenophon, Cyrus had 196,000 men in total, which was composed of 31,000 to 70,000 Persians. That consisted of 20,000 infantry, which may have included archers and slingers; 10,000 elite infantry/ cavalry, which may have been the Persian Immortals; and 20,000 peltasts and 20,000 pikemen. All except the archers and slingers are known to have carried small to large shields. The others were 42,000 Arabians; Armenians; and Medians, which amounted to 126,000 infantry. There were also 300 camel cavalry, 300 chariots, and 5-6 siege towers, which were known to hold 20 men each. It all amounted to more than 1,000 men, partly because there was one citizen, and one soldier on each chariot. 

Xenophon tells us that Croesus had an army of 420,000 men, which was composed of 60,000 Babylonians, Lydians, and Phrygians, also Cappadocians, plus nations of the Hellespont. This amounted to 300,000 men which included 60,000 cavalries. There were also 120,000 Egyptians, plus 300 chariots, which may have been at least 500 men. The numbers of the battle given by Xenophon, even if untrue, are considered within the realm of possibility, but less than half may have engaged in the actual battle.

==Battle==

Cyrus deployed his troops with flanks withdrawn in a square formation. The flanks were covered by chariots, cavalry, and infantry. Cyrus also used baggage camels to create a barrier around his archers. The smell of the camels disrupted the Lydian horses and scattered their cavalry charge as the archers fired upon Lydian forces.

As Cyrus had expected, the wings of the Lydian army wheeled inward to envelop this novel formation. As the Lydian flanks swung in, gaps appeared at the hinges of the wheeling wings. The disorder was increased by the effective overhead fire of the Persian archers and mobile towers, stationed within the square. Cyrus then gave the order to attack, and his flank units smashed into Croesus&#x27; disorganized wings. Soon, the Lydian cavalry lost many soldiers and was forced to retreat. With most of Cyrus&#x27; army intact and the loss of most of the Lydian cavalry, Cyrus ordered all cavalry and infantry to attack what remained of Croesus&#x27; forces. Most of the infantry soon surrendered, but Croesus and a small part of the infantry retreated and headed for the Lydian capital of Sardis, which resulted in a decisive victory for the Persians.

Herodotus gives an account of the battle but does not give any numbers. His account of the battle&#x27;s progress and outcome, however, confirms what Xenophon gives later.
==Aftermath==

After the battle, the Lydians were driven within the walls of Sardis and put to siege by the victorious Cyrus. The city fell after the 14-day Siege of Sardis, reportedly by the Lydians&#x27; failure to garrison a part of the wall that they had thought to be unsusceptible to attack because of the steepness of the adjacent declivity of the ground. Croesus was captured, and his territory, including the Greek cities of Ionia and Aeolis, was incorporated into Cyrus&#x27; already-powerful empire.

That development brought Greece and Persia into conflict and culminated in the celebrated Persian wars of Cyrus&#x27; successors. Along with acquiring Ionia and Aeolis, Cyrus also had the Egyptian soldiers, who fought on behalf of the Lydians, voluntarily surrender and join his army. 

According to the Greek author Herodotus, Cyrus treated Croesus well and with respect after the battle. The Babylonian &quot;Nabonidus Chronicle&quot; apparently contradicts that by reporting that Cyrus defeated and killed the king, but the identity of the Lydian king is unclear.

<text>Biswamoy Biswas (2 June 1923 – 10 August 1994) was an Indian ornithologist who was born in Calcutta, the son of a professor of geology. In 1947, he was awarded a three-year fellowship by Sunderlal Hora, then director of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI). It enabled him to study at the British Museum, at the Berlin Zoological Museum under Erwin Stresemann and also at the American Museum of Natural History under Ernst Mayr.

Biswas studied biology in his college instead of geology as his father wished. He graduated from the University of Calcutta in 1943 and received an MSc in 1945. He received a Ph.D. in 1952 from the University of Calcutta working under J.L. Bhaduri. He was part of the Daily Mail expedition sent to look for the Yeti around Mount Everest in 1954. He was elected Corresponding Fellow of The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1963. He later took charge of the Bird and Mammal Section of the Zoological Survey of India. He won Chapman Grants from the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1965, 1966 and 1970, for research at the British Museum. Later, he was joint director of the ZSI, until he retired in 1981, and then emeritus scientist until 1986.

Some of his landmark works were on the birds of Nepal and Bhutan.

A flying squirrel species &quot;Biswamoyopterus biswasi&quot; is named in his honour.

<text>The Battle of Pteria () was fought in 547 BC between the Persian forces of Cyrus the Great and the Lydian forces of Croesus. Both armies suffered heavy casualties in this indecisive battle.

==Background==
Croesus learned of the sudden Persian uprising and defeat of his longtime rivals, the Medes. He attempted to use these set of events to expand his borders upon the eastern frontier of Lydia, by making an alliance with Chaldea, Egypt and several Greek city-states, including Sparta. Prior to his invasion, Croesus asked the Oracle of Delphi for advice. The Oracle suggested vaguely that, &quot;if King Croesus crosses the Halys River, a great empire will be destroyed.&quot; Croesus received these words most favorably, instigating a war that would ironically and eventually end not the Persian Empire but his own.

Croesus began the campaign with an invasion of Cappadocia, crossing the Halys and capturing Pteria, then capital of the district and formidable as a fortress. The city was sacked, and the inhabitants enslaved.

Cyrus advanced to halt the Lydian incursion. He incorporated northern Mesopotamia, while receiving the voluntary capitulation of Armenia, Cappadocia, and Cilicia.

==Battle==
Both armies met in the vicinity of the fallen city. Cyrus was said to have been heavily outnumbered, with only 25,000 men against what is said to have been near 100,000 (though this is likely an exaggeration). Fierce urban combat followed, during which Cyrus and Croesus both personally led teams of troops into the streets of the abandoned city. Cyrus&#x27; leadership and bravery, along with the refusal of the Persian Immortals to retreat when pressed, is said to allowed the Persians to hold off. The urban fighting continued till nightfall, but was inconclusive. Both sides sustained considerable casualties; in the aftermath, the outnumbered Croesus withdrew across the Halys. The retreat of Croesus was a strategic decision to suspend operations using winter to his advantage, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements from his allies the Babylonians, the Egyptians and particularly the Spartans. This would prove to be a mistake, as Cyrus was able to quickly follow in his enemy&#x27;s wake while the main Persian army (still mustering) assembled.

==Aftermath==
Despite the arrival of winter, Cyrus continued his march on Sardis.
The dispersal of Croesus&#x27; army exposed Lydia to the unexpected winter campaign of Cyrus, who almost immediately followed Croesus back to Sardis. The rival kings fought again at the Battle of Thymbra, before Sardis, which ended in a decisive victory for Cyrus the Great.

<text>Isla Lang Fisher (; born 3 February 1976) is an Australian actress. Born in Oman to Scottish parents who moved with her to Australia during her childhood, she began appearing in television commercials and came to prominence for her portrayal of Shannon Reed on the Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; (1994–1997), for which she received two Logie Award nominations.

Fisher transitioned to Hollywood with a supporting role in the comedy horror film &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002) and has since starred in films such as &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (2005), &quot;Wedding Daze&quot; (2006), &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; (2009), &quot;Bachelorette&quot; (2012), &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (2013), &quot;Now You See Me&quot; (2013), and &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; (2016). Her other credits include &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), &quot;Definitely, Maybe&quot; (2008), &quot;Keeping Up with the Joneses&quot; (2016), &quot;Tag&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Beach Bum&quot; (2019), in addition to voice roles in animated films such as &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008), &quot;Rango&quot; (2011), &quot;Rise of the Guardians&quot; (2012), &quot;Back to the Outback&quot; (2021), and &quot;Dog Man&quot; (2025).

Fisher had a recurring role on the fourth and fifth seasons of the sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2013–2019) and has starred in the comedy drama series &quot;Wolf Like Me&quot; since 2022. She has authored two young adult novels and the &quot;Marge in Charge&quot; book series. From 2010 to 2024, she was married to English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, with whom she has three children.

==Early life==
Isla Lang Fisher was born in Muscat, Oman, on 3 February 1976, the daughter of Scottish parents Elspeth Reid and Brian Fisher. At the time, her father was working there as a banker for the United Nations. Fisher and her family returned to their hometown of Bathgate, Scotland, then moved to Australia when she was six years old and settled in Perth. She has four brothers and said that she had a &quot;great&quot; upbringing in Perth with a &quot;very outdoorsy life&quot;. She has stated that her &quot;sensibility is Australian&quot;, she has a &quot;laid-back attitude to life&quot;, and that she feels &quot;very Australian&quot;. Her parents later separated; her mother and brothers now live in Athens, Greece, while her father lives in Frankfurt, Germany. Fisher attended Swanbourne Primary School and Methodist Ladies&#x27; College in Perth. She appeared in lead roles in school productions such as &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. At the age of 21, she attended L&#x27;École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris, where she studied clown, mime, musical theatre, and commedia dell&#x27;arte.

==Career==

===1985–2001: Early acting credits===
Fisher made her first on-screen appearances in commercials on Australian television at the age of 9, and made her professional acting debut in 1993 with two guest-starring roles in the children&#x27;s television shows &quot;Bay City&quot; and &quot;Paradise Beach&quot;. At 18, with her mother&#x27;s help, she published two teen novels, &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;Seduced by Fame&quot;. In a 2005 interview with &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, she said that had she not been successful as an actress, she would probably have been a full-time writer.

Between 1994 and 1997, Fisher played Shannon Reed, a young, woman who develops anorexia, on the Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot;. In a 1996 interview with &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot;, she spoke of her success and experiences on the show: &quot;I would be stupid to let it go to my head because it could all end tomorrow and I would just fade back into obscurity. I like working on &quot;Home and Away&quot; but it&#x27;s a heavy workload so I get stressed out a lot. We work about 15 hours a day, including the time it takes to learn lines. I know a lot of people work those sort of hours but I think we really feel it because most of us are young and fairly inexperienced. But I am very grateful because it is good experience. It&#x27;s like an apprenticeship, but we do it in front of 20 million people so all our mistakes are up for the world to see.&quot; For her performance in the series, Fisher received nominations for Most Popular New Talent at the 1995 Logie Awards, and for Most Popular Actress at the 1997 ceremony.

After leaving the soap, Fisher enrolled at L&#x27;École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, a theatre and arts training school in Paris, and went on to appear in pantomime in the United Kingdom. She also toured with Darren Day in the musical &quot;Summer Holiday;&quot; appeared in the London theatre production of &quot;Così,&quot; and played an ill-fated member of an elite group of international students in the German slasher film &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; (2001).

===2002–2004: Move to Hollywood===
Fisher transitioned to Hollywood in 2002, with the part of the love interest of a cowardly slacker Shaggy Rogers in the live-action film &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. Although &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; received negative reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing US$275.7 million worldwide. On that early stage in her career, Fisher remarked: &quot;I only came out on the back of the movie for the premiere of &quot;Scooby Doo&quot;. And then, I ended up getting representation and ended up getting a job, almost straight away. So, I was fortunate, in that I didn&#x27;t have to come out to L.A. and join a queue of however many people, and try to get work. I came in on the back of what was deemed as a big studio movie that had had extraordinary success&quot;. She subsequently played supporting roles in the independent film &quot;Dallas 362&quot; (2003) and the Australian comedy &quot;The Wannabes&quot; (also 2003). In his review for the latter, David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; felt that Fisher &quot;adds easy charm and a thinly developed hint of romantic interest&quot;, in what he summed as an &quot;uneven but endearing farce about breaking into showbiz&quot;. In the comedy &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), directed by David O. Russell, she played what was described as a &quot;punchy little part&quot;, by newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;.

===2005–2009: Breakthrough===

Fisher&#x27;s breakthrough came with the comedy &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (2005), opposite Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, taking on the role of the seemingly sexually aggressive and precocious younger daughter of a politician falling in love with an irresponsible wedding crasher. On her part in the film, she remarked: &quot;It was an interesting character to play, because she was so crazy and lacking in any kind of social etiquette. She doesn&#x27;t care what anyone thinks.&quot; For one particular scene, involving sexual content, she used a body double. &quot;I negotiated that from the beginning, trying to analyse why. I find pornographic violence, just gratuitous and unnecessary than nudity, because there&#x27;s nothing more peaceful and beautiful&quot;. The film was favourably received by critics and made US$285.1 million worldwide. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine found Fisher to be an &quot;unexpected, scene-stealing joy&quot;, and her performance earned her the Best Breakthrough Performance Award at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards and two Teen Choice Awards nominations.

Fisher appeared as a Manhattan party host in the independent drama &quot;London&quot; (2005), opposite Jessica Biel, Chris Evans and Jason Statham. She next starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Wedding Daze&quot; (2006), with Jason Biggs, playing a dissatisfied waitress who spontaneously gets engaged to a grieving young man. While &quot;Wedding Daze&quot; opened in second place on its UK opening weekend, the film received mediocre reviews from critics. Nevertheless, &quot;Reel Film Reviews&quot; found the film to be an &quot;irreverent, sporadically hilarious romantic comedy that boasts fantastic performances from stars Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher&quot;. In the thriller &quot;The Lookout&quot; (2007), opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Matthew Goode, Fisher played a woman used by a gang leader to seduce a man with lasting mental impairments. Describing on how she took her character, she said: &quot; It was one of those situations where I read the script and thought, &#x27;This is the take. I don&#x27;t want to play the cliché femme fatale. I don&#x27;t want to come in and be the woman with the sexual appetite, who wants to take down this man. I want to come in and make her this big beating heart, and innocent a woman who has no identity, who knows the man she&#x27;s with, who doesn&#x27;t have an agenda&#x27;. Because every character in the script has an agenda. I thought how interesting if my character doesn&#x27;t have one if she&#x27;s a victim of her own kindness. So, that was my starting point&quot;. While &quot;The Lookout&quot; received a limited release, the film was favourably received. The comedy &quot;Hot Rod&quot; (also 2007), with Andy Samberg, saw Fisher star as the college-graduate neighbour on whom an amateur stuntman has a crush.

Fisher played a copy girl who becomes romantically involved with an ambitious political consultant in the romantic comedy &quot;Definitely, Maybe&quot; (2008), with Ryan Reynolds, Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz and Abigail Breslin. Reviewers felt the film was a &quot;refreshing entry into the romantic comedy genre&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the &quot;interest lies&quot; in the female characters, concluding: &quot;Isla Fisher, short, with thick auburn hair, is a changeable free spirit who keeps the male lead, and maybe herself off balance&quot;. Budgeted at US$7 million, &quot;Definitely, Maybe&quot; was a commercial success, grossing US$55.4 million worldwide. Fisher also voiced a professor in a city of microscopic creatures in the animated comedy film &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008), featuring Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Will Arnett, among others.

Fisher obtained her first leading film role in the comedy &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; (2009), where she played a college graduate who works as a financial journalist in New York City to support her shopping addiction. She felt &quot;apprehensive&quot; as she took on her first star vehicle, stating: &quot;I was gobsmacked that anyone would give me my own movie. I am eternally bewildered. Every time I see [producer] Jerry Bruckheimer, I want to shake him and say: &#x27;Are you mad? Why would you put me on a poster?&#x27;&quot;. Upon its release, the film received lukewarm reviews from critics; while &quot;Time Out&quot; described her as &quot;silly and adorable&quot;, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; remarked: &quot;Isla Fisher is such a bundle of comic energy that watching her spin her wheels in the aggressively unfunny &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; counts as cruel and unusual punishment for her as well as for us&quot;. Despite the critical response, the film was a commercial success; it opened with US$15 million on its North America opening weekend and went on to gross US$108.3 million worldwide. Fisher received her third Teen Choice Award nomination.

===2010–2013: Mainstream recognition===
In the British black comedy &quot;Burke and Hare&quot; (2010), loosely based on the Burke and Hare murders, Fisher starred opposite Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis as a young former prostitute and the love interest of one of the titular characters. The film found a limited audience in theatres, and &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;Pegg and Fisher, just about holding up their end of the bargain by delivering the film&#x27;s portion of sweet romance, are hardly given anything funny to say&quot;, as part of an overall mixed reception. Fisher voiced a hot-tempered but good-hearted desert iguana befriending an eccentric chameleon in the 3D animated Western action comedy &quot;Rango&quot; (2011), featuring Johnny Depp, Abigail Breslin and Bill Nighy. The film received positive reviews and made US$245.7 million worldwide. For her role, Fisher won the Alliance of Women Film Journalists Award for Best Animated Female.

Fisher starred in the comedy &quot;Bachelorette&quot; (2012), opposite Kirsten Dunst, Lizzy Caplan and Rebel Wilson, portraying a ditzy party girl and one-third of a trio of troubled women who reunite for the wedding of a friend who was ridiculed in high school. In its review for the film, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; found Fisher to be &quot;brilliantly slow as a hot mess whose main ambition is to get coked out of her skull&quot;. Budgeted at US$3 million, &quot;Bachelorette&quot; was a commercial success; it grossed US$11.9 million in theatres worldwide and more than US$8 million on VOD. In another voice-over role, Fisher voiced the Tooth Fairy in what she summed up as an &quot;animated &quot;Avengers&quot;&quot;, the film &quot;Rise of the Guardians&quot; (also 2012), which earned her an Alliance of Women Film Journalists Award nomination for Best Animated Female.

Fisher found mainstream recognition in 2013, with roles in two highly successful films &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;Now You See Me&quot;. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1925 novel, directed by Baz Luhrmann, and opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire, saw her portray an ambitious social climber and the mistress of an upper-class socialite. Fisher described as &quot;surreal&quot; the experience to work for Luhrmann. &quot;He&#x27;s my dream director. I&#x27;ve only ever had a short list of people I&#x27;ve wanted to work with, and he was at the top of it. I honestly couldn&#x27;t stop smiling the whole time&quot;. While reviewers described her role as brief, the film made US$353.6 million worldwide. Fisher garnered nominations for the Best Supporting Actress award from the AACTA Awards, the Australian Film Critics Association and the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards. Fisher took on a larger role as an escapist and stage magician in the heist thriller &quot;Now You See Me&quot;, with Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Mélanie Laurent and Morgan Freeman. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt that Fisher&#x27;s portrayal was &quot;loaded with &quot;chutzpah&quot;&quot;, and &quot;IndieWire&quot; remarked in its review for the film: &quot;While Fisher and Laurent bring their charm, they still don&#x27;t quite flesh out underwritten parts&quot;. Like &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, &quot;Now You See Me&quot; grossed more than US$350 million globally.

Also in 2013, Fisher obtained the nine-episode role of an actress in the fourth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, which was released on Netflix, and appeared opposite Jennifer Aniston, Tim Robbins, and Will Forte in &quot;Life of Crime&quot;, a film adaptation of Elmore Leonard&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;The Switch&quot;, as the mistress of a wealthy man who refuses to pay the ransom for his kidnapped wife. The film received a limited theatrical release and favorable reviews from critics. Fisher, along with the cast of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, and describing her work on the series as a career highlight, she said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been really fortunate in my career to work with a lot of great people and get a lot of great gigs, but my favourite phone call ever was the &quot;Arrested Development&quot; one from my agent, It was very exciting&quot;.

===2014–present: Various roles and writing===
In &quot;Visions&quot; (2015), an independent horror film, Fisher starred as a pregnant woman who begins to experience supernatural manifestations after moving to a vineyard with her husband. Distributed for a limited release in most international markets, &quot;Visions&quot; was released for VOD in North America, and in its review for the film, Spanish newspaper &quot;Reforma&quot; wrote: &quot;Predictable and boring, even Isla Fisher, who is usually pretty good, delivers a very boring performance.&quot; 2016 saw Fisher star in two action comedy films &quot;Grimsby&quot; and &quot;Keeping Up with the Joneses&quot;. She collaborated for the first time with husband Sacha Baron Cohen in the British film &quot;Grimsby&quot;, playing the handler of the best MI6 agent, and in &quot;Keeping Up with the Joneses&quot;, she starred as one half of a suburban couple who begin to suspect their new neighbours are secret agents. Both films were budgeted at over US$35 million, but only made less than US$30 million at the box office.

Based on Austin Wright&#x27;s novel &quot;Tony and Susan&quot;, Tom Ford&#x27;s neo-noir thriller &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; (2016) featured Fisher as the blighted wife of a motorist inside a violent novel written by a recently divorced man. The film was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival and was an arthouse success. Her third book and first children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Marge in Charge&quot;, revolving around a mischievous babysitter with rainbow hair who tends to bend the rules, was published in 2016. The book was met with a positive reception; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted that &quot;spontaneity and mayhem&quot; reign in the work, while &quot;The Daily Express&quot; found &quot;the comic tale of [the] anarchic babysitter&quot; to be &quot;perfect for reading aloud&quot;. Fisher subsequently authored three follow-ups: &quot;Marge and the Pirate Baby&quot;, in 2017, &quot;Marge and the Great Train Rescue&quot;, also in 2017, and &quot;Marge in Charge and the Stolen Treasure&quot;, in 2018. In 2019, she guest starred in an episode of the tenth season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. In 2020, Fisher starred in the Walt Disney Pictures film &quot;Godmothered&quot;, which was released on Disney+ on 4 December of that year.

In 2024, it was announced that she will voice Sarah Hatoff in the upcoming film &quot;Dog Man&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
In 2014 and 2015, Fisher donated her signed shoes for the Small Steps Project Celebrity Shoe Auction.

In 2015, Fisher and her husband Sacha Baron Cohen donated £335,000 to Save the Children as part of a programme to vaccinate Syrian children against measles, and another £335,000 to the International Rescue Committee to help Syrian refugees.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Fisher met English comedian and actor Sacha Baron Cohen at a party in Sydney. They became engaged in 2004 and were married on 15 March 2010 in a Jewish ceremony in Paris. 

She converted to Cohen&#x27;s Judaism in order to marry him, about which she later said, &quot;I will definitely have a Jewish wedding just to be with Sacha. I would do anything, move into any religion, to be united in marriage with him. We have a future together and religion comes second to love as far as we are concerned.&quot; After three years of studying, she completed her conversion in early 2007. She took the Hebrew name Ayala (), the Hebrew word for a doe, and has described herself as keeping the Jewish Sabbath.

They have three children, born in 2007, 2010 and 2015. They resided in Sydney, having previously divided their time between Los Angeles and London. 

On 5 April 2024, Fisher announced that she and Baron Cohen had made the decision to end their 13-year marriage, separating at the end of 2023.

Fisher considers herself a feminist.

<text>At the Battle of Sepeia (; c. 494 BC), the Spartan forces of Cleomenes I defeated the Argives, fully establishing Spartan dominance in the Peloponnese. The Battle of Sepeia is infamous for having the highest number of casualties within a battle during the classical Greek period.

The closest thing to a contemporaneous source for the description of the battle is, as for many events in this time period, the Histories of Herodotus (written approximately fifty years later, c. 440 BC). Herodotus provides context of the political, military and economic landscape of the Peloponnese before, during and after the Battle of Sepeia. During the 5th century Sparta was one of the largest military powers in the Peloponnese. This is evident through the Spartans&#x27; victory over Argos in the Battle of the 300 Champions (546 BC) to gain control over the highly disputed territory of Thyrea. However, the Argives sought revenge on Sparta, seizing back control of Thyrea approximately fifty years after the Battle of the 300 Champions. Ultimately, this reignited tensions between the Spartans and the Argives, driving the two forces to engage in what is now known as the Battle of Sepeia.

The Spartan forces were led by the Agiad King Cleomenes I. Cleomenes wished to take action against Argos. The King often used religion as a political tool of manipulation to enlist the support of the Spartan people. Thus, Cleomenes sent four Púthιoι to the Oracle of Delphi (also known as Pythia) seeking the oracle&#x27;s support and religious reassurance. Cleomenes proclaimed that the Oracle of Delphi predicted Sparta’s triumph over Argive forces in a future battle. Thus, Cleomenes had gained the religious approval necessary to enlist the support of the Spartan people to wage war on Argos.

The Argive forces also sought the advice of the Oracle of Delphi. However, the Oracle foretold the Argives of their looming defeat in a future battle. Thus, the Argives were cautious of their Spartan enemies, and reluctant to engage in battle if not forced to do so.

Ultimately, when the Battle of Sepeia began, the foretold predictions by the Oracle of Delphi, dictated the stratagems employed by the Spartans and the Argives respectively. The Argives, cautious of the Spartan’s predicted victory, decided to listen to the Spartan Herald’s commands to his troops and copy what the Herald said. This allowed for the Argives to take their meal breaks at the same time as the Spartans, ensuring the Spartans would not attack the Argives when not prepared for battle. When Cleomenes became aware that the Argives were paying close attention to the Herald’s orders, he instructed his forces to ignore the next mealtime call and attack at this call instead. When the Herald made his call for a mealtime break, the Spartans attacked an unsuspecting Argive force. Many Argives were slaughtered, with the surviving hoplites seeking refuge in a nearby grove named ‘The Sacred Grove of Apollo’.

Cleomenes, unwilling to leave any Argive survivors, devised a strategy to trick the hoplites into leaving the Grove’s religious and physical protection. Cleomenes deceived the Argive men into believing that a ransom had been granted and paid – allowing for their release. However, when an Argive man tried to walk free, they were executed. When the Argives realised what was occurring, they stopped responding to the ransom calls. Consequently, Cleomenes set the grove on fire forcing the remaining hoplites out of the grove’s protection. The Battle of Sepeia resulted in approximately 6000 deaths, accounting for an estimated fifty per cent of the Argive population.

The significance of this Battle is illustrated through the revolution of the Argive political system. The doûloι experienced an elevated social status, due to the loss of noble Argive men. 

== Prelude ==

The fertile plain of Thyrea was a long-disputed territory that lay between the two city states of Sparta and Argos. During the Battle of the 300 Champions (546 BC) Sparta gained control over this region. Nearly two generations had since passed when Argos reclaimed Thyrea.

The events that occurred after this held significant religious undertones. Once the Oracle of Delphi had foretold the success of Sparta against Argos, Cleomenes led his armies to the Erasinos River on the border of the Argolid. 
Herodotus believes Cleomenes intended to camp his forces there, however when the king presented a sacrifice to the Erasinos River he received bad omens. Rather uncharacteristically, Cleomenes obeyed the signs of the River God proclaiming: &quot;“I admire the God of the River for refusing to betray his countrymen. But the Argives will not get away that easily”&quot; and left. Cleomenes then retreated South and marched his Spartan forces East of Thyrea to Sicyon.

In Thyrea, Cleomenes made another sacrifice to the sea to access the river via a different route. This time the omens appeared favourable. Consequently, Cleomenes made arrangements with the Aeginetans and Sicyonians, to transport the Spartan forces to the district of Tiryns and Nauplia (on the coast of the Argolid). The transportation route Cleomenes arranged was a challenging maritime task to fulfil, involving the transportation of the Spartan forces across the díolkos at Corinth.

== Dating the Battle ==
Whilst Herodotus has been used as the primary source for the Battle of Sepeia, other historians have contested the date of this battle. Herodotus fails to explicitly date the battle, recording the event as part of the whole Spartan expedition against Argos. The only mentioning of a date occurs in his book Pausnias III, where Herodotus suggests the battle occurred at the beginning of the reign of Cleomenes I i.e. 520 BC.
Modern historians have attempted to calculate a date for the battle based on other passages from Herodotus. When the Argives visited the Oracle of Delphi, two predictions were told; the demise of Argos and that of the Milesians, both of which are foretold to occur at the same time. The part of the prophecy concerning the Milesians was fulfilled at the end of the Ionian Revolt (494BC). Thus, the estimated date for the Battle of Sepeia is 494BC.

== Strategic and Tactical Deliberations ==

The strategic and tactical deliberations of the Battle of Sepeia begin with Spartan’s march to Argos. Initially, Cleomenes led the Spartans to the Erasinos River, on the border of the Argolid, before reporting that the omen’s were not favourable there to set up camp. Interpretations of Cleomenes retreat, suggests the Argives had gained the higher ground on the opposite side of the stream. Cleomenes reconvened his army on the border of Tiryns. The Argive forces were caught off guard by the Agiad King’s repositioning; rushing to set up camp in Sepeia at a close distance from the Lacedaemonians. The Argives had lost their high ground advantage.

== Battle ==

Ultimately, Sparta won the Battle of Sepeia through deception. Reluctant to engage in battle, the Argives had been mimicking the Spartan Herald&#x27;s call for meal time breaks. This ensured the Spartans did not attack the Argives when the hoplites were not prepared.
When Cleomenes became aware of this strategy, he was able to weaponize this against them. Cleomenes instructed his forces to ignore the Herald’s announcement and instead attack at this call. The Argive forces were caught off guard, and a slaughter ensued.

However, other historical accounts suggest a seven-day truce had been agreed upon by the two forces. Contrary to Herodotus’ account, Plutarch suggests the Spartan forces broke the truce on the third night and attacked the unsuspecting Argives. When Cleomenes was questioned for his breach of the truce; the King argued the truce was made for seven days and didn’t include nights.

Additionally, Cicero further contests the nature of the Battle in his treatise ‘De Officiis’. Cicero suggests a thirty-day truce was agreed upon between the Spartans and the Argives. However, similar to Plutarch, Cicero describes a situation in which a general plunders the fields at night, because the truce had been made for days and not nights. Cicero does not mention a specific date of the attack nor does he explicitly name Cleomenes or the Argives. Consequently, due to the large differences between Cicero’s and Plutarch’s account, and Cicero’s inability to name Cleomenes I, it is improbable that Cicero’s account would be used as evidence for the Battle.

== Aftermath ==
After the initial onslaught, many Argive hoplites sought refuge in the ‘Sacred Grove of Apollo’. The Argive men hoped the religious value of the grove would prevent the Spartan forces pursuing further action. However, Cleomenes I was by reputation ruthless, and deceived the Argives to their death. Cleomenes announced that the hoplites who’d been ransomed for the standard fee were free to leave. The names of the men whose ‘ransom’ had been paid were called out individually. However, when an Argive hoplite stepped out of the Sacred Grove, they were executed by the Spartans. According to Herodotus, at least fifty Argive men were deceived by this strategy, until one of the men inside the grove climbed a tree and witnessed what was happening. Thus, when the Argives became aware of the double cross, they stopped responding to the ransom calls. Consequently, Cleomenes set fire to the grove, slaughtering any survivors who attempted to escape.

The Battle of Sepeia and the sacrilege that ensued resulted in six thousand Argive casualties. Whilst Pausanias records a loss of five thousand Argive men, modern historians widely accept Herodotus’ higher figure.

Due to the nature and ambiguity pertaining to historical sources and administration during the time period, an accurate estimation of the Argive population is improbable. However, Aristotle in his fifth book ‘Politics’, recorded a Spartan population of ten thousand. If the assumption was made that we could assume a similar Argive population during the Battle of Sepeia, the losses of six thousand would have compromised a large majority of young and middle-aged Argive men. Ultimately, the Battle of Sepeia was one of the most decisive battles during Ancient Greek history.

== Significance ==

The Battle of Sepeia severely depleted Argos’ military power. The Argives were unable to engage in battle for a generation. The next time Sparta and Argos fought would be in the Peloponnesian wars.

Additionally, this Battle holds profound political consequences, provoking an upheaval of the Argive administrative system. Due to the high number of casualties during the Battle of Sepeia, Argos lost a majority of their young and middle-aged men. Consequently, the city was in need of men to fulfil the political and administrative roles of recently deceased noblemen. Ultimately, due to the high number of widowed women and shortage of noble Argive men, many doûloι married into political and administrative 

positions. Prior to the Battle of Sepeia, the doûloι were slaves and belonged in the bottom echelons of society. The Battle of Sepeia essentially allowed for a political revolution, elevating the status of the doûloι, until Argive born noble men reached maturity.

Consequently, based on the Agrarian economy and serf labour, women of the Dorian ruling class enjoyed greater political, social and economic freedoms (compared to women from Sparta and Crete) during the classical period.

<text>Agave tequilana, commonly called blue Weber agave () or tequila agave, is an agave plant that is an important economic product of Jalisco state of Mexico, due to its role as the base ingredient of tequila. The high production of agavins (branched oligosaccharides composed mostly of fructose) in the core of the plant is the main characteristic that makes it suitable for the preparation of alcoholic beverages.

The tequila agave is native to the states of Jalisco, Colima, Nayarit, Michoacán, and Aguascalientes in Mexico. The plant favors altitudes of more than and grows in rich and sandy soils. Blue agave plants grow into large succulents, with spiky fleshy leaves, that can reach over in height. Blue agaves sprout a stalk when they are about five years old. These stalks can grow an additional , and they are topped with yellow flowers. The stalk is cut off from commercial plants so the plant will put more energy into the heart.

The flowers are pollinated by the greater long-nosed bat (and by insects and hummingbirds) and produce several thousand seeds per plant, many of them sterile. The plant then dies. Cultivated plants are reproduced by planting the previously removed shoots; this has led to a considerable loss of genetic diversity in cultivated blue agave.

It is rarely kept as a houseplant, but a 50-year-old blue agave in Boston grew a stalk requiring a hole in the greenhouse roof and flowered in the summer of 2006.

==Tequila production==

Tequila is made only from a specific cultivar of &quot;Agave tequilana&quot; called &quot;Weber Azul.&quot; The plant is from the Asparagaceae family. This cultivar is larger and blue-gray in color compared to the smaller and green normal &quot;A. tequilana&quot;. It is a rapid grower and prolific offsetter in keeping with its agricultural advantages. Tequila is produced by removing the heart (&quot;piña&quot;) of the plant in its seventh to fourteenth year (depending on growth rate and whims of harvester). Harvested &quot;piñas&quot; normally weigh . This heart is stripped of its leaves and heated to convert the inulin to sugars. Then the roasted core is pressed or crushed to release the sugary clear liquid called aguamiel, which is, in turn, fermented and distilled into alcohol. Tequila is also made with a sugar formulation of 51% agave and 49% other sugars. These tequilas are referred to as Mixtos.

==Pathogens affecting the plant==
As agave production has moved to an industrial scale since the end of the 1980s, diseases and pests, collectively referred to as TMA (&quot;tristeza y muerte de agave&quot;, &quot;wilting and death of agave&quot;), have hit the crops. Through the 1990s, diseases spread, particularly &quot;Fusarium&quot; fungi and &quot;Erwinia&quot; bacteria, exacerbated by the low genetic diversity of the agave plants. Other problems include the agave weevil, &quot;Scyphophorus acupunctatus&quot;, and a fungus, &quot;Thielaviopsis paradoxa&quot;.

According to a 2004 study, additional pathogens, &quot;Erwinia carotovora&quot;, &quot;Enterobacter agglomerans&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas mendocina&quot;, and &quot;Serratia&quot; spp. are responsible for continued rot.

<text>Frank Jack Fletcher (April 29, 1885 – April 25, 1973) was an admiral in the United States Navy during World War II. Fletcher commanded five different task forces through the war; he was the operational task force commander at the pivotal battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, which collectively resulted in the sinking of five Japanese aircraft carriers.

In 1914, then Lieutenant Fletcher was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle at Veracruz. He was the nephew of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, who was also awarded the Medal of Honor for actions at Veracruz.

==Early life and early Navy career==
Fletcher was born in Marshalltown, Iowa, on April 29, 1885. 

Appointed to the US Naval Academy in 1902, he graduated on February 12, 1906, served two years at sea as required by law at the time, and was commissioned as an ensign on February 13, 1908. His classmates included Arthur L. Bristol, William L. Calhoun, William A. Glassford, Charles C. Hartigan, Aubrey W. Fitch, Robert L. Ghormley, Isaac C. Kidd, John S. McCain Sr., Leigh Noyes, Ferdinand L. Reichmuth, John H. Towers, Russell Willson, and Thomas Withers.

Following graduation from the Naval Academy, he served on the battleships and , operating in the Atlantic. After a year in the yacht-turned-gunboat on special service, he reported to the battleship , of the Atlantic Fleet, in December 1908. In August 1909, he was assigned to the screw frigate , his duty drafting men for the Pacific Fleet and transporting them on board the armored cruiser to Cavite in the Philippines.

In November 1909, he was assigned to the destroyer , operating as part of the Asiatic Torpedo Flotilla. Fletcher assumed command of the destroyer in April 1910, and in March 1912, he returned to &quot;Chauncey&quot; as her commanding officer. In December 1912, he was transferred to the battleship . In April 1914, he was aboard &quot;Florida&quot;, the flagship of his uncle Frank Friday Fletcher, during the occupation of Veracruz, Mexico. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for the rescue of refugees on the transport &quot;Esperanza&quot;.

Detached from &quot;Florida&quot; in July 1914, he served briefly in &quot;Tennessee&quot; before reporting as aide and flag lieutenant on the staff of the Commander in Chief, US Atlantic Fleet in July 1914. After a year at this post, he returned to the Naval Academy for duty in the Executive Department.

==World War I and interwar service==
Following the outbreak of World War I, he served as gunnery officer of the battleship until September 1917, after which he assumed command of yacht-turned-patrol vessel . He was assigned to the destroyer in February 1918. He took command of the destroyer in May 1918, receiving the Navy Cross for leading her through &quot;important, exacting and hazardous duty&quot;.

From October 1918 to February 1919, he assisted in fitting out the destroyer , but was detached before her commissioning. He then had similar duty with the destroyer , and upon her commissioning on March 8, 1919, assumed command. He was relieved of that command in April 1919. 

Returning to Washington, he was head of the Detail Section, Enlisted Personnel Division in the Bureau of Navigation until September 1922.

He returned to the Asiatic Station, having consecutive command of the destroyer , the gunboat , the submarine tender , and the submarine base at Cavite. Returning to the United States, he served at the Washington Navy Yards from March 1925 to 1927; became executive officer of the battleship ; and completed the Senior Course at the Naval War College, Newport in 1929–30, followed immediately by the Army War College in Washington, D.C., 1930–31, in preparation for strategic leadership responsibilities.

Fletcher became chief of staff to the Commander in Chief, US Asiatic Fleet in August 1931. In the summer of 1933, he was transferred to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. Following this assignment, he served from November 1933 to May 1936, as aide to the Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable Claude A. Swanson.

He assumed command of the battleship , flagship of Battleship Division Three, in June 1936. In December 1937, he became a member of the Naval Examining Board, and became Assistant Chief of Bureau of Navigation in June 1938. In November 1939, Fletcher was promoted to Flag Rank, Rear Admiral, and Commander Cruiser Division Three (Light Cruisers). In June 1940, Rear Admiral Fletcher was placed in command of Cruiser Division Six (Heavy Cruisers), the position he held on December 7, 1941. Fletcher was scheduled to become Commander, Cruisers, Scouting Force, in administrative charge of all heavy cruisers, but the events of December 7 changed those plans.

==World War II==
===Pearl Harbor===
RAdm Fletcher was serving as Commander Cruiser Division Six and at sea when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Kimmel, Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet (CinC PAC), thought enough of Fletcher to put his name third on a short list of potential successors, if necessary. According to Rear Admiral Thomas Kincaid, although Fletcher was scheduled to become Commander, of Cruisers, Scouting Force, Admiral Kimmel postponed this change in order to place Fletcher in command of the Wake Island relief task force.

===Wake Island: December 8–23, 1941===
Prior to December 7, Wake Island had received reinforcements, including aircraft for defense. At the time of Pearl Harbor, it was under the command of Commander Winfield Scott Cunningham and included a Marine Corps Defense Battalion, commanded by Major James Devereux. A day after Pearl Harbor, reports were received from Wake Island of a Japanese bombardment and subsequent invasion attempt. Kimmel expected Wake Island to hold out in the short run and on December 10, drafted an Operations Order for the relief of Wake. On December 15, Kimmel placed Fletcher in command of Task Force (TF) 14 for the relief of Wake, which consisted of the fleet carrier , the fleet oiler , the seaplane tender , three heavy cruisers (, , ), and eight destroyers: (, , , , , , , ). Fletcher commanded the task force from the cruiser &quot;Astoria&quot;, while Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch sailed aboard &quot;Saratoga&quot;. Events caused a delay in the departure of TF 14, as well as a delay in D-Day, the date of the actual relief effort. TF 14 sailed west towards Wake Island at less than 13 knots, as fast as the slowest ship could travel, with plans to arrive at Wake Island on December 24 (D-Day). Fletcher had been instructed to fuel prior to arriving at Wake Island. Underway refueling was still a work in progress which took time and required calm sea conditions.

However, certain events took place that had a drastic impact on the relief effort. The primary event was the relief of Kimmel as CinC PAC by Admiral Chester Nimitz. Since Nimitz was in Washington, D.C., Vice Admiral William Pye assumed the duties of CinC PAC on December 17, until Nimitz&#x27;s arrival. Pye brought in personnel from his staff (he commanded the Pacific Fleet battleships), and debates began regarding the intelligence information being provided, primarily whether the Japanese Navy had moved aircraft carriers to Wake in support of their invasion. On December 22, the Japanese began another invasion attempt of Wake. Given the new assault and a lack of understanding regarding the disposition of Japanese naval forces in the area, Pye ordered TF 14 to return to Pearl Harbor on December 22, abandoning the relief effort. On the return trip, the equipment loaded on &quot;Tangier&quot; was delivered to Midway Island.

===January–April 1942===
On January 1, 1942, Fletcher took command of Task Force 17, built around the carrier . Although a surface fleet admiral, he was chosen over more senior officers to lead the carrier task force. He learned air operations on the job while escorting troops to the South Pacific. He was the junior TF commander under the tutelage of the experts: Vice Admiral William Halsey during the Marshalls-Gilberts raids in February; Vice Admiral Wilson Brown attacking the enemy landings on New Guinea in March; and he had aviation expert Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch with him during the first Battle of the Coral Sea.

On April 19, 1942, Fletcher was designated Commander Cruisers, Pacific Fleet, with additional duty as Commander Cruiser Division Four.

===Coral Sea: May 4–8, 1942===

In May 1942, Fletcher commanded the task forces during the Battle of the Coral Sea. This was the first carrier-on-carrier battle fought between fleets that never came within sight of each other. Fletcher with the aircraft carrier , Task Force 17, had been patrolling the Coral Sea and rendezvoused with Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch with the aircraft carrier , Task Force 11, and a tanker group. Fletcher finished refueling first and headed west. On hearing the enemy was occupying Tulagi, Task Force 17 attacked the landing beaches, sinking several small ships before rejoining &quot;Lexington&quot; and an Australian cruiser force under Rear Admiral John Gregory Crace on May 5.

The next day, intelligence reported a Japanese invasion task force headed for Port Moresby, New Guinea, and a carrier strike force was in the area. The morning of May 7, Fletcher sent the Australian cruisers to stop the transports while he sought the carriers. His combat pilots sank the , escorting the enemy troop ships—&quot;Scratch one flat top.&quot; radioed Lieutenant Commander Robert E. Dixon flying back to &quot;Lexington&quot;. That same day, Japanese carrier planes of Rear Admiral Chuichi Hara found the American tanker . Believing they had found a carrier, they severely damaged her after several all-out attacks, and sank her escorting destroyer, ; on May 11, the destroyer located her, rescued the surviving crew, and sank her with naval gunfire.

On May 8, at first light, &quot;round three opened.&quot; Fletcher launched 75 aircraft, Hara 69. Fitch had greater experience in handling air operations, and Fletcher delegated him that function, as he was to do again later with Noyes at Guadalcanal. The aircraft carrier was hit, but not damaged below the waterline; it sailed away. Another carrier, , had earlier dodged under a squall. The Japanese attack put two torpedoes into &quot;Lexington&quot;, which was abandoned that evening. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was hit near her island, but survived. Hara failed to use &quot;Zuikaku&quot; to achieve victory and withdrew. Now without air cover, the invasion fleet also withdrew, aborting the Port Moresby invasion.

Fletcher had achieved the objective of the mission at the cost of a carrier, a tanker, and a destroyer. In addition, his Grumman F4F Wildcats had beaten Japanese air groups 52 to 35, and had damaged &quot;Shōkaku&quot;; neither Japanese carrier would be able to join the fight at Midway the following month. This was the first World War II battle in which the Imperial Japanese Navy had been stopped. In battles at Pearl Harbor, the East Indies, Australia, and Ceylon, they had defeated the British, Dutch, and Asiatic Fleets, and had not lost a fleet ship larger than a minesweeper or submarine.

===Midway: June 4–7, 1942===

In June 1942, Fletcher was the officer in tactical command at the Battle of Midway with two task forces, his usual Task Force 17—with a quickly repaired &quot;Yorktown&quot;—plus Task Force 16, with and . Vice Admiral William Halsey normally commanded this task force, but had become ill and was replaced by Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. When aircraft from four Japanese carriers attacked Midway Island, the three American carriers—warned by cracked Japanese codes and waiting in ambush—attacked and sank three enemy carriers: , , and .

&quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; lost 70 aircraft. Japanese attacks on June 4 severely damaged &quot;Yorktown&quot;; repairs returned her to the battle until she was hopelessly disabled by a new round of attacks two hours later. Fletcher&#x27;s scouts found the fourth enemy carrier, , and &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with &quot;Yorktown&quot; planes, then sank it. At dusk, Fletcher released Spruance to continue fighting with Task Force 16 the next day. During the next two days, Spruance found two damaged cruisers and sank one. The enemy transport and battle fleets retreated.

A Japanese submarine, , found the crippled &quot;Yorktown&quot;, under tow, on June 5 and sank her along with an escorting destroyer, . Japan had had seven large carriers—six at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack and one new construction. Four were sunk at Midway. This did not win the war, but evened the odds between Japanese and American fleet carriers. Following the battle, Fletcher was promoted to vice admiral and continued to command a carrier group at sea, after shifting his flag to the carrier .

===Landing at Guadalcanal: August 7–9, 1942===
As the United States took the offensive in August 1942, Vice Admiral Fletcher commanded Task Force 61 during the invasion of Tulagi and Guadalcanal by the 1st Marine Division. Carrier close air support was provided at Tulagi. The invasion of Guadalcanal was uncontested on the beach. Fletcher requested permission from Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, the overall commander, to withdraw his carriers from the dangerous waters when they were no longer needed, claiming that his aircraft losses and fuel state due to maneuvering required him to leave. Fletcher thought that the few American carriers should not be risked against multi-engine, land-based, torpedo bombers, when they were needed for combat against enemy carriers. Fletcher chose to withdraw on the evening of August 8, leaving light forces and many transport ships unprotected from the inevitable Japanese counterattack.

The Battle of Savo Island occurred in early morning of August 9, 1942. Allied warships screening the transports were surprised at midnight and defeated in 32 minutes by a Japanese force of seven cruisers and one destroyer, commanded by Japanese Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa. One Australian and three American heavy cruisers were sunk, and another American cruiser and two destroyers were damaged in this lopsided Japanese victory. As Crutchley notes, the transports were not touched. Fletcher is sometimes criticized because his carriers were at the far end of their nightly withdrawal, steaming back for the morning, yet too far away to seek revenge.

Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner&#x27;s offloading of supplies did not go as well as expected because of Japanese air raids. He had to withdraw the transports on the evening of August 9, after Fletcher left and most of his cruisers were sunk, over the strenuous objections of the ground commander, Marine General Alexander Vandegrift. The Marines refer to this as the &quot;Navy Bugout&quot;, because the reserve Marine regiment and the division&#x27;s heavy artillery, much of its ammunition and also most of its medical supplies and rations had yet to be unloaded. The Navy&#x27;s withdrawal left the Marines ashore initially completely unprotected against Japanese land-based air raids from Rabaul and from nightly shelling by Imperial Japanese Navy cruisers and battleships that came down the &quot;Slot&quot; from their large naval and air base at Rabaul.

===East Solomons: August 24–25, 1942===

Fletcher fought a superior Japanese fleet intent on counter-invasion in the aircraft carrier Battle of the Eastern Solomons. He initiated the engagement, and the force under his command sank the carrier . The ensuing battle was essentially a giant aerial dogfight interspersed with shipborne anti-aircraft fire. The United States lost 20 aircraft; the Japanese lost 70. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was hit by three bombs; the Japanese seaplane tender was nearly sunk, but survived. The enemy withdrew without landing troops on Guadalcanal and had to resort to the Tokyo Express: the overnight delivery of a few hundred troops and supplies by destroyers.

Fletcher was criticized by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Ernest King, for not pursuing the Combined Fleet as it withdrew. This criticism may have affected the decision to not return Fletcher to his command after his flagship carrier, , was torpedoed and damaged by a Japanese submarine on August 31, 1942. Fletcher himself suffered a gash to his head in the attack, for which he received the Purple Heart. He was relieved of command, sent on leave (his first leave after eight months of continuous combat), and subsequently sent to Alaska.

===Northern Pacific===
From November 1942 – 1945, Fletcher commanded naval forces in the North Pacific from the Alaskan island of Adak. In November 1942, he became commandant of Thirteenth Naval District and commander of Northwestern Sea Frontier. He was relieved as commandant in October 1943, but continued to serve as commander Northwestern Sea Frontier until April 15, 1944, when the Northwestern Sea Frontier was abolished and the Alaskan Sea Frontier established. He then became Commander of the latter, with additional duty as Commander North Pacific Force and North Pacific Ocean Area. It was revealed in July 1945 that Task Force 90, under his overall command, had made the first penetration through the Kurile Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk on March 3 and 4, 1945, and the same task force on February 4, 1945, bombarded Paramushir in the first sea bombardment of the Kurile.

==Postwar and final days==

In September 1945, following the cessation of hostilities in the Far East, he proceeded to Ōminato, Japan, with the North Pacific Force (consisting of about sixty vessels) for the emergency naval occupation of Northern Japan. He remained there until ordered to return to the United States, and on December 17, 1945, was appointed to the Navy&#x27;s General Board. On May 1, 1946, as Senior Member of that Board he became Chairman, and continued to serve in that capacity until relieved of all active duty for his retirement on May 1, 1947, with the rank of full admiral. He retired to his country estate, Araby, in Maryland.
Many of Fletcher&#x27;s papers were lost in combat. He declined to reconstruct them from Pentagon archives or to be interviewed by Samuel Eliot Morison, who was writing the &quot;History of United States Naval Operations in World War II&quot;. In return, he received no consideration by Morison, an attitude picked up by later authors. At least one author felt Fletcher did not get enough credit for forces under his command sinking six Japanese carriers.

Fletcher died on April 25, 1973, four days before his 88th birthday, at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His widow, Martha Richards Fletcher (born 29 March 1895, at Kansas City, Missouri), whom Fletcher married in February, 1917, died seventeen months later, on 14 September 1974. She was buried next to her husband.

==Legacy==
, a , the second ship to bear the name, was named for Frank Jack Fletcher. The first, , the lead ship of the , commissioned June 30, 1942, was named for his uncle, Frank Friday Fletcher.

The 1976 movie &quot;Midway&quot; depicted Fletcher (played by Robert Webber) as somewhat confused and hesitant during the battle. Charlton Heston, who played a fictional naval officer working with Fletcher, wrote in his personal journals that this portrayal was based on the advice of some Navy veterans critical of Fletcher, and he said he and Webber tried to make it as subtle as possible.

<text>Kinza Godfrey Clodumar (8 February 1945 – 29 November 2021) was a Nauruan politician who served as President of Nauru from 1997 to 1998.

==Background==
Clodumar was born in Boe. He was a member of the indigenous population of Nauru, and he was concerned with environmental issues. He was a Member of Parliament for many years.

Clodumar was the only Nauruan politician to have been elected to parliament in two different constituencies. He served his first two terms for the Aiwo Constituency when ousting Itubwa Amram in the 1971 elections; after being re-elected thrice Clodumar resigned his post in early 1979, but was re-elected in the 1983 elections. In 1992, he did not stand for the seat and moved to the neighbouring Boe Constituency, where he was re-elected in 1995 to serve a third term in parliament.

Clodumar served as Minister Assisting the President of Nauru in the cabinets of Bernard Dowiyogo and Kennan Adeang in 1976-1978 and from September 1986 to October 1986. He was the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru from a short term in December 1986.

He was Minister of Finance several times: January 1977 to January 1978, September 1986 to October 1986, December 1986 to August 1989, December 1989 to September 1993 and in November 1996.

Clodumar gave and withdrew support from several other Nauruan politicians, including Bernard Dowiyogo, René Harris and Ludwig Scotty. For presidents, withdrawal of support by Clodumar often meant that a president would lose a no confidence vote.

==Presidency==
Clodumar was President of Nauru from 12 February 1997 until 18 June 1998, when he was deposed in a no confidence vote. He held the office of Minister of Finance of Nauru during his term.

==Later life==
He later served again as Minister of Finance several times: April 1999 to June 1999, May 2000 to August 2000, March 2004 to May 2004 and June 2004 to August 2004. In 2003, Clodumar himself tried to regain the presidency of Nauru twice but narrowly lost the parliamentary vote both times. He lost his seat in Parliament in the October 2004 election.

Clodumar was also noted for having founded and led the Centre Party.

He died on 29 November 2021, at the age of 76, and received a state funeral the following day.

<text>Joel (; – &quot;Yōʾēl&quot;; – &quot;Iōḗl&quot;; – &quot;Yu&#x27;il&quot;) is a Biblical prophet, the second of the Twelve Minor Prophets, and, according to itself, the author of the Book of Joel, which is set in the early Assyrian period. Scholars meanwhile view the Book of Joel as having been completed in the Ptolemaic period (c. 301-201 BC) due to its use of earlier texts and perspective on Yahweh and the nations.

==Name==

Joel is mentioned by name only once in the Hebrew Bible, in the introduction to that book, as the son of Pethuel (Joel 1:1). The name combines the covenant name of God, YHWH (or Yahweh), and El (god), and has been translated as &quot;YHWH is God&quot; or &quot;one to whom YHWH is God,&quot; that is, a worshiper of YHWH.

==Life==
Some commentators suggest that Joel lived in the 9th century BC, whereas others assign him to the 5th or 4th century BC. The dating of his book is similarly debated; there are no mentions of kings that might help locate it in time. The book&#x27;s mention of Greeks has not given scholars any help in dating the text since the Greeks were known to have had access to Judah from Mycenaean times (c. 1600–1100 BC). However, the book&#x27;s mention of Judah&#x27;s suffering and to the standing temple have led some scholars to place the date of the book in the post-exilic period, after the construction of the Second Temple. Joel was originally from Judah/Judea, and, judging from its prominence in his prophecy, was quite possibly a prophet associated with the ritual of either Solomon&#x27;s or the Second temple, depending on the date when he lived. 

According to a long-standing tradition, Joel was buried in Gush Halav. In the western outskirts of the modern village, there is a structure that has long been considered Joel&#x27;s tomb, which contains several ancient rock-cut tombs.

==In Christianity==
On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, his feast day is 19 October.

In the Roman Martyrology, the prophet is commemorated on 13 July.

He is commemorated with the other minor prophets in the Calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on 31 July.

Joel&#x27;s statement that &quot;I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions&quot; was applied by St Peter in his sermon at Pentecost to the events of that day.

According to the Eastern Orthodox Christian hymns, the ancient hymnographer Anatolius links Joel&#x27;s prophecy to the birth of Christ. In Joel 2:30, he says that the blood refers to the incarnation of Jesus Christ, the fire to the Divinity of Christ, and the pillars of smoke to the Holy Spirit.

==In the Baháʼí Faith==
Joel is considered a minor prophet in the Baháʼí Faith. In the Kitab-i-Iqan, Baha&#x27;ullah states that previous prophecies by minor prophets such as Joel have symbolic meanings and significance and therefore should not be understood literally.

<doc id="745909" wikidata="Q565557" url="?curid=745909" title="Doctor Who and the Silurians">
<text>Doctor Who and the Silurians is the second serial of the seventh season in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was first broadcast in seven weekly parts on BBC1 from 31 January to 14 March 1970.

The serial is set in an English moorland, the cave system below it, and London. In the serial, the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) attempts to broker peace between humanity and the Silurians, an intelligent bipedal race of reptilians that ruled Earth before humans. This effort becomes undone by a xenophobic usurper Silurian, along with gung-ho human soldiers.

The story is the first appearance of the Silurians, for whom the Silurian hypothesis in science is named.

==Plot==
A nuclear powered cyclotron facility in some caves under a moorland is experiencing mysterious power drains and mental breakdowns amongst staff. The Third Doctor and Liz Shaw meet Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart there to investigate. Major Baker, the security chief, believes there is a saboteur in the centre.

The Doctor and Liz discover a Silurian base with the signal device, where they witness a Silurian being revived from hibernation by a machine, explaining the energy drains that the reactor has been experiencing.

Masters, the Permanent Under-Secretary in charge of the centre, arrives. The Doctor tells them about the Silurians in the caves, urging peaceful contact. However, this is ignored when Quinn&#x27;s assistant reveals that he was killed by the Silurian he held captive. The Doctor attempts to warn the Silurians, but they put him in a cage. He is able to reason with the leader of the Silurians, who attempts to convince his brethren to find a way of co-existing with humans. The younger Silurian refuses and kills the leader, usurping the title as leader.

Baker is later infected with a deadly strain of bacteria by the Silurians before he is released, resulting in an epidemic to spread across Britain. The Doctor is able to find a cure, which is mass produced, ending the epidemic.

The Doctor, Liz and the Brigadier are then abducted by the Silurians and taken to the power plant, where the Doctor overloads the reactor and tells the younger Silurian that the area will be irradiated for at least 25 years. The Silurians re-enter the caves to hibernate until the danger has passed. Since the mechanism is faulty, the younger Silurian will stay awake to operate it and sacrifice his life. The Doctor and Liz repair the reactor. The younger Silurian realises he has been duped into sending his race back to sleep. He attacks the Doctor but is shot by the Brigadier.

The Doctor insists that the caves are to remain untouched to allow the Silurians to hibernate peacefully, hopeful that talks of peace may occur between them and humankind in the future. However, the Brigadier orders the caves to be destroyed, killing the Silurians inside and horrifying the Doctor, who opposed the mass murder of the Silurians.

==Production==
After the previous story, producers Derrick Sherwin and Peter Bryant (who was originally to have the producer&#x27;s credit on this story) were transferred to the television series &quot;Paul Temple&quot;, and the BBC intended for Barry Letts to become producer. However, Letts was committed to another production, and could not be released until after the location work on &quot;Silurians&quot; was completed. Script editor Terrance Dicks and his assistant Trevor Ray shared the production responsibilities for the location work.

The incidental music for the serial was composed by Carey Blyton, who would also contribute music for &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot; (1974) and &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (1975).

This story is the first to be recorded using colour studio cameras. The previous serial, &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, was the first in colour, but was shot entirely on location (i.e., outside the electronic TV studio), and on film (as opposed to videotape, the standard method for recording &quot;Doctor Who&quot;). Due to the move to colour, the production team made use of a technique known as Colour Separation Overlay (CSO, or Chroma key), which allowed images to be superimposed over each other using colour separation. This was used extensively in the series for many years, beginning with this serial.

Location filming took place at Marylebone station in London on 12 November 1969, but after the prints were damaged, the scenes were reshot on 24 November after the rest of the serial had been finished. Other location work was undertaken in Surrey, with the heathland scenes filmed at Hankley Common.

===Alternative titles===

This was the only time the name &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was used in the title of a serial on-screen (although Episode 5 of &quot;The Chase&quot; was titled &quot;The Death of Doctor Who&quot; on-screen and at the end of &quot;The Gunfighters&quot;, the caption read &quot;Next Week Doctor Who and the Savages&quot;). Although it was common in production paperwork to prefix &quot;Doctor Who and...&quot; to the story title at the time, the prefix was usually dropped when the director ordered the titles from the captioning department for transmission. However, this was not done for this particular story.

The reasons why this happened are not entirely clear. Director Timothy Combe states that he was presented with a story called &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; and that it was always intended that the serial go out with that name. However, as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; historian Andrew Pixley points out, this was Combe&#x27;s first serial as a full director and there was effectively no producer at this time, as noted above. In addition, the rehearsal scripts for the serial simply have &quot;The Silurians&quot; as the title. Pixley theorises that Combe was unaware of the standard production practice and gave the order to the captioning department for the &quot;proper&quot; title, as he believed it to be at the time.

Whatever the case, production paperwork from this point on stopped the practice of adding the prefix, perhaps as a measure to prevent the &quot;mistake&quot; from happening again.

===Cast notes===
Actor Paul Darrow would return to the series playing Tekker in &quot;Timelash&quot; (1985); he also appeared in the audio play &quot;The Next Life&quot;.

Geoffrey Palmer, who played Masters, also appears in &quot;The Mutants&quot; (1972) and in &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (2007).

Peter Miles later played Professor Whitaker in &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot; (1974) and Nyder in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975). He also played Tragan in the radio drama &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot; and Gantman in the audio play &quot;Whispers of Terror&quot;.

Norman Jones had previously appeared as Khrisong in &quot;The Abominable Snowmen&quot; (1967) and would later play Hieronymous in &quot;The Masque of Mandragora&quot; (1976).

Ian Talbot, who played Travis in Episode Four, would later return as Klout in &quot;The Leisure Hive&quot; (1980).

Richard Steele, who plays Sergeant Hart, previously appeared as Commandant Gorton in Episode 2 of &quot;The War Games&quot; (1969) and would later appear as a guard in &quot;The Mark of the Rani&quot; (1985).

==Broadcast and reception==
The restored episodes were repeated on BBC2 on Tuesday evenings from 7 December 1999 to 25 January 2000, with a two-week gap between episodes three and four. Episode six was shifted to Thursday 20 January.

Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote that the story had &quot;quality in spades&quot;, especially in the location filming, and that the story was &quot;gritty&quot; and &quot;provocative&quot; with &quot;fine character actors&quot;. He praised the design and the voice-acting of the Silurians but felt their rubber costume on-screen made them come across as &quot;silly&quot;. Braxton was also disappointed with other production &quot;shortcomings&quot;, such as the &quot;cheap-looking&quot; cave set, the dinosaur, and &quot;Carey Blyton&#x27;s electro-bagpiped Silurian theme&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Christopher Bahn wrote that it &quot;keeps a snappy pace throughout thanks to Malcolm Hulke&#x27;s well-plotted script&quot;. He noted that both the monsters and the humans were more complex than previously seen on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Like Braxton, he also felt the serial was &quot;badly served by the Silurian costumes, which are terrible even by the standards of low-budget, 1970s TV&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott noted that some parts were &quot;a bit slow&quot; due to the length, but it was a &quot;mature&quot; story where Pertwee defined his Doctor. However, Sinnott felt that John was still trying to find her character&#x27;s place, and did not have much chemistry with Pertwee. Den of Geek gave a positive review of the serial, writing that &quot;the production is only marred by its excessive number of episodes compared to the story it had to tell ... and an often-appalling &#x27;medieval&#x27; score by experimentalist Carey Blyton&quot;. In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed Episode Six&#x27;s cliffhanger as one of the best in all of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Anders listed the serial as a good example of the early Pertwee years, calling it &quot;pretty fantastic&quot; with enemies who &quot;aren&#x27;t just one-dimensional baddies&quot; and the length &quot;somewhat justified by a harrowing subplot where a plague starts killing people all across London&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Hulke, was published by Target Books in January 1974 under the title &quot;Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters&quot;. In this adaptation, the Silurians were given names like Morka, Okdel and K&#x27;to. The novelisation gives extensive background to the reptile culture, including a prologue featuring their hibernation beginning. Large parts of the novelisation are told from the reptiles&#x27; point of view and there is an extensive back-story given to several characters including Quinn and Major Baker (called Barker in the novelisation). The novelisation avoids referring to the reptiles as Silurians (the word turns up as a UNIT password) but identifies the dinosaur in the caves as a tyrannosaurus rex. The novelisation was also translated into Dutch, Finnish, Japanese and Portuguese. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actress Caroline John was released on CD in September 2007 by BBC Audiobooks.

===Home media===
The original 625-line PAL videotapes of the serial were wiped by the BBC for reuse, although they retained 16 mm b/w film recordings. In 1993, the colour signal from a 525-line NTSC version of all seven episodes (except for part of the beginning of episode 4) was used, along with colourisation techniques, to colourise the film prints for the VHS release, which was in July that year. In October 2006, the story&#x27;s original soundtrack was released on CD as part of the &#x27;Monsters on Earth&#x27; tin set, again alongside &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; and &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot;, with linking narration from Caroline John. The CD was then individually re-issued in January 2008.

On 14 January 2008, a fresh restoration of the story was released on DVD as part of the boxed set called &quot;Beneath the Surface&quot;, also including &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; and &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot; (the black-and-white prints and off-air colour recordings were combined, with the colour prints distorted to reduce fringing and both prints processed with VidFIRE to restore video sections to 50 unique fields per second, rather than 25 frames per second, with no motion information between the two fields corresponding to each frame). The story was then released on DVD again in 2013, included in a set paired with &quot;The Hungry Earth&quot; and &quot;Cold Blood&quot; (a two-part Eleventh Doctor story from 2010), in &#x27;The Monster Collection&#x27; series, specifically &quot;The Silurians&quot; entry.

<doc id="745940" wikidata="Q975123" url="?curid=745940" title="Battle of Notium">
<text>The Battle of Notium (or Battle of Ephesus) in 406 BC was a Spartan naval victory in the Peloponnesian War. Prior to the battle, the Athenian commander, Alcibiades, left his helmsman, Antiochus, in command of the Athenian fleet, which was blockading the Spartan fleet in Ephesus. In violation of his orders, Antiochus attempted to draw the Spartans into battle by tempting them with a small decoy force. His strategy backfired, and the Spartans under Lysander scored a small but symbolically significant victory over the Athenian fleet. This victory resulted in the downfall of Alcibiades, and established Lysander as a commander who could defeat the Athenians at sea.

==Prelude==
In 407 BC, Lysander was appointed as navarch, commander of the Spartan fleet, replacing the deceased Mindarus. Gathering a fleet as he went, he sailed east across the Aegean from the Peloponnese and eventually reached Ephesus, where he established his base, with 70 triremes, which he increased to 90 through shipbuilding efforts at Ephesus. In Ephesus, he established diplomatic relations with Cyrus, a Persian prince. Lysander built a personal friendship with Cyrus, and the prince agreed to provide funds out of his own purse to increase the pay of Spartan rowers to 4 obols a day from 3. With this increased funding, the Spartan fleet could attract experienced rowers from the Athenian fleet.

Alcibiades, needing to force a battle with Lysander, brought his fleet to Notium, where he could closely watch the Spartan fleet across the water. Merely sitting at Notium, however, failed to bring Lysander out to fight. Accordingly, Alcibiades sailed north with a few troopships to assist Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. The bulk of the fleet, which remained behind him, was placed under the command of Alcibiades&#x27; &quot;kybernetes&quot;, or helmsman. A fleet of this size (80 ships remained at Notium after Alcibiades&#x27; departure) would traditionally have been commanded by several generals, or at the least by a trierarch; Alcibiades&#x27; unconventional decision has been widely criticized by both ancient and modern authors. Antiochus was given one simple order to govern his actions; &quot;Do not attack Lysander&#x27;s ships.&quot; For some reason, he chose not to obey this order, and attempted to implement a stratagem that he thought would give the Athenians a victory.

==Battle==
Seeking to draw the Spartans out to fight, Antiochus sailed out towards Ephesus with 10 triremes. His plan was to draw the Peloponnesians out in pursuit of his small force, after which the rest of the Athenian force would ambush them. This plan was very similar to that which had produced the stunning Athenian victory at Cyzicus, but conditions at Notium were utterly different from those at that battle. In practice, Antiochus&#x27; ship was sunk, and he was killed, by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining nine ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, 15 Athenian triremes were captured and seven more were sunk. The Spartans sailed back to Ephesus, having won an unexpected victory, while the Athenians returned to Notium to regroup.

==Aftermath==
Upon receiving news of the battle, Alcibiades lifted the siege of Phocaea and returned south to reinforce the fleet at Notium; this restored rough numerical parity between the two fleets. Further attempts to draw Lysander out into a battle proved unsuccessful, however, and the two fleets continued to watch each other across the water.

The defeat at Notium caused the complete downfall of Alcibiades in Athenian politics. Restored to favor after the victory at Cyzicus, he had been placed in command with great expectations. When his unorthodox appointment of Antiochus led to a messy defeat, his political enemies saw their chance, and he was removed from office. Never again returning to Athens, he sailed north to land he owned in the Thracian Chersonese; except for a brief appearance at Aegospotami, his involvement in the war was over.

The commands of both fleets changed hands after Notium. Because of term limits on the position of navarch, Lysander was replaced by Callicratidas; on the Athenian side, the fall of Alcibiades also brought down his friends Thrasybulus and Theramenes, and the overall command was given to Conon. Over the next year, the fleets clashed twice, first in a battle where, with twice as many ships as Conon, Callicratidas defeated the Athenians and trapped them in Mytilene; an Athenian relief fleet then decisively defeated and killed Callicratidas at Arginusae. These Athenian victories proved useless, however, for in 405 BC Lysander returned to unofficial command and destroyed the Athenian fleet at Aegospotami, thus ending the Peloponnesian War with Sparta the victor.

Notium, although not terribly significant in the number of ships won or lost by either side (the gains made by the Spartan fleet were more than erased by their defeat at Arginusae), had the significant effect of launching the career of Lysander and ending that of Alcibiades. Lysander would go on to end the Athenian empire and contend for several years for control of the Spartan empire that replaced it; Alcibiades, meanwhile, would be assassinated in 403 BC, having never returned to his native city. Donald Kagan, meanwhile, has suggested that the most important effect of the battle on the Athenian side was the removal from command of Thrasybulus, the talented commander who had helped plan all the Athenian naval victories of 411 and 410 BC.

Notium, then, although not decisive in itself, had large political ramifications, and played a significant role in determining who would lead the forces of Athens and Sparta in the upcoming decisive battles of the war.

<text>Robert Woonton (born 1949) is a Cook Islands politician and diplomat. He served as Prime Minister of the Cook Islands from 11 February 2002 until 11 December 2004, and later as High Commissioner to New Zealand. He was a member of the centrist Democratic Party. 

Woonton trained as a medical doctor. He was first elected to the Cook Islands Parliament at the 1994 election. He was re-elected at the 1999 election. Following the premiership of Joe Williams, he was appointed to the Cabinet of Terepai Maoate as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Transport. In February 2001 he was removed as Transport Minister, but retained his Foreign Affairs portfolio. In July 2001, following the sacking of Norman George, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister.

==Prime minister==

In February 2002 Woonton resigned his portfolios and tabled a motion of no confidence against Maoate. The motion failed, and Woonton returned to the government. Three days later, Maoate resigned after losing a second confidence vote, and Woonton became prime minister.

Woonton&#x27;s premiership was beset by chaos and allegations of corruption. In May 2002, shortly after taking office, he was cleared of bribery allegations over claims he had approved the use of public money to fly an independent MP and his wife to New Zealand so she could receive medical treatment. In September 2002 he threatened to deport the publisher of the &quot;Cook Islands Independent&quot; after it published a story alleging he had used public money to purchase furniture for his private residence. In November 2002 he sacked Justice Minister Norman George, formed a new coalition with both the Democratic Party and Cook Islands Party, and promised early elections. A few months later in January 2003 he sacked Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry, replacing him with Democratic leader Terepai Maoate. In November 2003 Maoate in turn resigned after he tabled a motion of no confidence in the government. Later that month Woonton was officially elected leader of the Democratic Party, replacing Maoate. He was replaced again by Maoate in May 2004.

In December 2003 Woonton&#x27;s government faced allegations that it was selling residency, after it granted residency to convicted New Zealand businessman Mark Lyon in exchange for a $150,000 bond. Lyon was later banned from the Cook Islands, and Woonton attempted to sue those critical of the decision to allow him in for defamation. In May 2004 he made a state visit to China, in which he accepted US$2.5 million in aid in exchange for recognising that Taiwan was part of China. When the &quot;Cook Islands Herald&quot; published a satirical letter questioning this change in policy, Woonton attempted to have them prosecuted for criminal libel. Shortly afterward he dissolved Parliament for the election.

At the 2004 election Woonton&#x27;s government retained its majority, but Woonton was nearly defeated. While awaiting the result of electoral petitions, Woonton announced a new coalition with the Cook Islands Party. He was subsequently expelled from the Democratic Party and formed his own party, the Demo Party Tumu (later known as Cook Islands First). On 12 December 2004 a recount found that the result in Woonton&#x27;s electorate of Manihiki was a tie. Woonton resigned as prime minister, and was replaced by Jim Marurai. He did not contest the resulting 2005 Manihiki by-election.

Following the election, the Cook Islands Court of Appeal ruled that Woonton&#x27;s Cabinet had bribed voters in the electorate of Titikaveka in an effort to secure the election of Cabinet Minister Robert Wigmore.

==Post-political career==

In early 2005 Woonton was appointed High Commissioner to New Zealand, replacing Tom Davis. He was sacked in March 2006, following accusations that he was plotting with members of parliament to end Marurai&#x27;s government. Shortly after being sacked he joined a Wellington-based development firm which planned to build a new private hospital on Rarotonga. 

He now works as a doctor in Auckland. In 2011 he was appointed to the Auckland Council&#x27;s inaugural Pacific People&#x27;s Advisory Panel.

<text>Samaritan Hebrew () is a reading tradition used liturgically by the Samaritans for reading the Ancient Hebrew language of the Samaritan Pentateuch.

For the Samaritans, Ancient Hebrew ceased to be a spoken everyday language. It was succeeded by Samaritan Aramaic, which itself ceased to be a spoken language sometime between the 10th and 12th centuries and was succeeded by Levantine Arabic (specifically, the Samaritan variety of Palestinian Arabic.

The phonology of Samaritan Hebrew is very similar to that of Samaritan Arabic and is used by the Samaritans in prayer. Today, the spoken vernacular among Samaritans is evenly split between Modern Hebrew and Samaritan Arabic, depending on whether they reside in Holon or Kiryat Luza

==History and discovery==
The early history of Samaritan Hebrew is poorly documented, though it can be said that trying to directy connect it to Israelian Hebrew is a stretch. Because of the relatively late divergence of Samaritanism from mainstream Judaism its only by the 100&#x27;s BC there was definitely a separate Samaritan dialect, though it&#x27;s likely that the dialect is older than this.

The dialect didn&#x27;t survive long in a literary form as by the birth of christ it was already being supplanted by Samaritan Aramaic. Though it did survive to an extent and came under Aramaic influence which was later replaced by Arabic and Arabic influence. And eventually it stopped being used for liturgiacally for new texts. Starting in the 1300&#x27;s a liturgical revival of Samaritan Hebrew began which is hown through the composition of various &quot;piyyutim&quot; at the time.

The Samaritan language first became known in detail to the Western world with the publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1631 by Jean Morin. In 1616 the traveler Pietro Della Valle had purchased a copy of the text in Damascus. This manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library.

In five volumes between 1957 and 1977, Ze&#x27;ev Ben-Haim published his monumental Hebrew-language work on the Hebrew and Aramaic traditions of the Samaritans. Ben-Haim, whose views prevail today, proved that modern Samaritan Hebrew is not very different from the Hebrew spoken by other local groups in the Second Temple period before Middle Aramaic supplanted it.

==Orthography==

Samaritan Hebrew is written in the Samaritan alphabet, a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which in turn is a variant of the earlier Proto-Sinaitic script.

The Samaritan alphabet is close to the script that appears on many Ancient Hebrew coins and inscriptions. By contrast, all other varieties of Hebrew, as written by Jews, employ the later square Hebrew alphabet, which is in fact a variation of the Aramaic alphabet that Jews began using in the Babylonian captivity following the exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE. During the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use this stylized &quot;square&quot; form of the script used by the Achaemenid Empire for Imperial Aramaic, its chancellery script while the Samaritans continued to use the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which evolved into the Samaritan alphabet.

In modern times, a cursive variant of the Samaritan alphabet is used in personal affects.

===Letter pronunciation===
Consonants
Vowels
==Phonology==

===Consonants===

Samaritan Hebrew shows the following consonantal differences from Biblical Hebrew: The original phonemes do not have spirantized allophones, though at least some did originally in Samaritan Hebrew (evidenced in the preposition &quot;in&quot; ב- or ). has shifted to (except occasionally &gt; ). has shifted to everywhere except in the conjunction ו- &#x27;and&#x27; where it is pronounced as . has merged with , unlike in all other contemporary Hebrew traditions in which it is pronounced . The laryngeals have become or null everywhere, except before where sometimes become . is sometimes pronounced as , though not in Pentateuch reading, as a result of influence from Samaritan Arabic. may also be pronounced as , but this occurs only rarely and in fluent reading.

===Vowels===
Phonemic length is contrastive, e.g. רב &#x27;great&#x27; vs. רחב &#x27;wide&#x27;. Long vowels are usually the result of the elision of guttural consonants.

 and are both realized as in closed post-tonic syllables, e.g. בית &#x27;house&#x27; הבית &#x27;the house&#x27; גר הגר. In other cases, stressed shifts to when that syllable is no longer stressed, e.g. דברתי but דברתמה . and only contrast in open post-tonic syllables, e.g. ידו &#x27;his hand&#x27; ידיו &#x27;his hands&#x27;, where stems from a contracted diphthong. In other environments, appears in closed syllables and in open syllables, e.g. דור דורות .

===Stress===

Stress generally differs from other traditions, being found usually on the penultimate and sometimes on the ultimate.

==Grammar==

===Pronouns===

====Personal====
====Demonstrative====
====Relative====

Who, which: éšar.

====Interrogative====
* Who? = &quot;mī&quot;.
* What? = &quot;mā̊&quot;.

===Noun===
When suffixes are added, ē and ō in an unstressed syllable may become ī and ū: bōr (Judean &quot;bohr&quot;) &quot;pit&quot; &gt; buˈrōt &quot;pits&quot;. Note also af &quot;anger&quot; &gt; ˈeppa &quot;her anger&quot;.

Segolates behave more or less as in other Hebrew varieties: ˈbeṭen &quot;stomach&quot; &gt; ˈbaṭnek &quot;your stomach,&quot; ke′seph &quot;silver&quot; &gt; ke′sefánu (Judean Hebrew &quot;kasˈpenu&quot;) &quot;our silver,&quot; ˈderek &gt; dirkaˈkimma &quot;your (m. pl.) road&quot; but ˈareṣ (in Judean Hebrew: &quot;ˈʾereṣ&quot;) &quot;earth&quot; &gt; ˈarṣak (Judean Hebrew &quot;ˈʾárṣeḵa&quot;) &quot;your earth&quot;.

====Article====

The definite article is a- or e-, and causes gemination of the following consonant unless it is a guttural; it is written with a &quot;he&quot;, but as usual, the &quot;h&quot; is silent. Thus, for example: ˈennar / ˈannar = &quot;the youth&quot;; elˈlēm = &quot;the meat&quot;; aˈʾemor = &quot;the donkey&quot;.

====Number====

Regular plural suffixes are
* masc: -ˈēm (Judean Hebrew -im)
** eyyaˈmēm &quot;the days&quot;
* fem: -ˈt (Judean Hebrew: -oth.)
** elaˈmōt &quot;dreams&quot;

Dual is sometimes -aˈyem (Judean Hebrew: -ˈayim), šenatayem &quot;two years,&quot; usually -ˈēm like the plural yeˈdēm &quot;hands&quot; (Judean &quot;yaˈḏayim&quot;.)

===Tradition of the Divine Name===

Similar to Jews, Samaritans have the tradition of taboo avoidance of the Tetragrammaton, either spelling out loud with the Samaritan letters: &quot;Yoḏ Ye Bā Ye&quot;, or saying &quot;Shema&quot; &quot;the Name&quot; in Aramaic, similar to Judean HaShem.

===Verbs===
===Particles===

<text>The Battle of Himera (480 BC), supposedly fought on the same day as the Battle of Salamis, or at the same time as the Battle of Thermopylae, saw the Greek forces of Gelon, King of Syracuse, and Theron, tyrant of Agrigentum, defeat the Carthaginian force of Hamilcar the Magonid, ending a Carthaginian bid to restore the deposed tyrant of Himera. The alleged coincidence of this battle with the naval battle of Salamis and the resultant derailing of a Punic-Persian conspiracy aimed at destroying the Greek civilization is rejected by modern scholars. Scholars also agree that the battle led to the crippling of Carthage&#x27;s power in Sicily for many decades. It was one of the most important battles of the Sicilian Wars.

The discovery in 2007 and 2008 of mass graves from the battle has confirmed the location and nature of the battle.

==Background==
The Phoenicians had planted trading posts all over the coast of Sicily after 900 BC, but had never penetrated far inland. They had traded with the Elymian, Sicani and Siculi communities and ultimately withdrew without resistance to Motya, Panormus and Solus when the Greeks arrived after 750 BC. These cities remained independent until becoming part of the Carthaginian hegemony after 540 BC, probably when Malchus of Carthage &quot;conquered all Sicily&quot; and sent the captured booty to Tyre.

===Carthaginian hegemony and Greeks in Sicily===
Carthage created her hegemony in part to resist Greek encroachments in the Phoenician sphere of influence. Phoenicians initially (750–650 BC) did not resist the Greeks, but after the Greeks had reached Iberia sometime after 650 BC, Carthage emerged as the leader of Phoenician resistance. During the 6th century BC, mostly under the leadership of the Magonid dynasty, Carthage established a commercially dominant position in the Western Mediterranean. The Phoenicians in Sicily and the Elymians had teamed up to defeat the Greeks of Selinus and Rhodes near Lilybaeum in 580 BC, the first recorded clash between Phoenicians and Greeks incident in Sicily. The next known Greek incursion in Sicily took place 70 years later.

The Greeks living in Sicily behaved similar to mainland Greeks, expanding their political and commercial domain while keeping the Ionian/Dorian feud alive – the Doric colonies were comparably more aggressive in expanding their territory. As Sicilian trade flourished, the Greeks and the Phoenicians and the Sicilian Greeks colonies became prosperous. This prosperity enabled some of the Greek cities to start to expand their territories again, ultimately leading to the events known as the &quot;First Sicilian War&quot;.

====Carthage joins the fight====
Carthage and Elymians joined forces in 510 BC to oppose the expedition of Prince Dorieus, who had lost the Spartan throne and was seeking to found a colony, showed up to colonize Eryx – after being expelled from Libya by Carthage in 511 BC. Dorieus was defeated and killed; the Greek survivors then founded Heraclea Minoa. Sicilian Greeks (probably the cities of Akragas, Gela and Selinus) fought an undated war of revenge against Carthage, which led to the destruction of Minoa and a treaty which brought economic benefits for the Greeks. An appeal for aid to avenge the death of Dorieus was ignored by mainland Greece, even by Leonidas of Sparta, brother of Dorieus and who later would win immortal fame at Thermopylae in 480 BC. This possibly demonstrated the futility of opposing Carthage by single Greek cities or the unreliability of aid from mainland Greece, a situation that would change with the rise of the Greek tyrants in Sicily.

===Greek tyrants===
While Carthage remained engaged in Sardinia after 510 BC, most of the Greek cities in Sicily fell under the rule of tyrants. The tyrants of Gela, Akragas and Rhegion successfully expanded their dominion during 505–480 BC, with the Dorian city of Gela being the most successful.

====Dorian Greeks dominate Sicily====
Cleander (505–498 BC) and his brother Hippocrates (498–491) of Gela successfully took over both Ionian and Dorian Greek territory, and by 490 BC, Zankle, Leontini, Catana, Naxos, besides neighboring Sicel lands and Camarina had fallen to Gela. Gelo, successor of Hippocrates, captured Syracuse and made the city his capital. By using deportation and enslavement, Gelo transformed the former Greek Ionian cities into Greek Dorian ones and made Syracuse the dominant power in Sicily. Meanwhile, Akragas, another Doric city, had taken over neighboring Sikan and Sicel lands under the tyrant Theron (488–472 BC). To forestall any conflicts between Akragas and Syracuse, Gelo and Theron married into each other&#x27;s families, thus creating a united front against the Sicels and Ionian Greeks of Sicily.

====Ionian Greeks call on Carthage====
To counter this Doric threat, the Greek Anaxilas of Rhegion, who had captured Zankle from Gela in 490 BC, allied himself with Terillus of Himera, and married the daughter of Terillus. Himera and Rhegion next became allies of Carthage, the tyrants even built up personal relationships with the Magonid dynasty of Carthage. Selinus, a Doric city whose territory bordered Theron&#x27;s domain, also became a Carthaginian ally – perhaps the fear of Theron and the destruction of Megara Hyblaea (mother city of, Selinus), by Gelo, had played a part in this decision. Thus, 3 power blocks were delicately balanced in Sicily by 483 BC – Ionians dominating the north, Carthage the west, Dorians the east and south. The Sicels and Sikans in the interior remained passive, and if not directly under Greek rule, did not hinder the movements of their forces. The Elmyians joined the Carthaginian alliance.

==Prelude==

The city of Himera had once requested Phalaris, tyrant of Akragas (570–554 BC), to rule Himera. Theron emulated Phalaris when he deposed Terillus and added Himera to his domain in 483 BC. Terillus had come to power in Himera after expelling the ruling oligarchs (who had taken refuge in Akragas), and he probably lacked popular support, which may have been exploited by Theron. Terillus requested Hamilcar, Suffet of Carthage, and Xenia (guest friend) of Terillus, for aid. Anaxilas also lobbied on his behalf, and sent his own children as hostages to Carthage as a token of loyalty. After a 3-year delay, Hamilcar led a Carthaginian expedition to Sicily in 480 BC, which coincided with the expedition of Xerxes against mainland Greece.

===Gelo refuses Greece aid===
The mainland Greeks had sent an embassy to Gelon requesting aid against Xerxes. Gelon at first complained that the Greeks spurned his request of aid against the Carthaginians in the past, but he offered to send 24,000 foot, 4000 horse and 200 warships in addition to fully provisioning the combined Greek force in Greece if he was made the supreme commander. The Spartans objected to this, and Gelon then asked to be the commander of either the land or naval forces in exchange for his help. The Athenian envoy then objected, and the Greeks were sent packing empty handed. Gelon also hedged his bets, he sent 3 ships under Cadmus of Kos to Delphi, with instructions to offer his submission to Xerxes in case of a Persian victory.

===Carthaginian expedition===
Hamilcar is said to have assembled an army numbering 300,000 soldiers from Iberia, Sardinia, Corsica, Italy, Gaul and Africa, generally mercenaries (like the famed Iberian mercenaries) and under the command of a body of Carthaginian officers, along with war chariots, 200 warships and 3,000 transports for the venture. According to the modern historians, the numbers are clearly inflated; the Punic army may not have been significantly larger than that of the Greek coalition. The army had no siege engines and the Etruscans and the Elymians, allies in past struggles against Greeks, were not part of it.

====Carthaginian army====
The core units of the army came from Africa. The heavy African infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses. The light Libyan infantry carried javelins and small shields. The Iberian infantry wore purple bordered white tunics and leather headgear, and fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy javelins, long body shields and short thrusting swords. Sardinian and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear, but often were equipped by Carthage.

The Libyans, Carthaginian citizens and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields. Iberians and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all out charge. Libyans also provided the bulk of the heavy, four-horse war chariots for Carthage.

===Sicilian Greek army===
Gelo and Theron had a well trained, battle tested army at their disposal. In addition to citizens, hired mercenaries from Greeks and Sicels augmented their forces. Gelon took out a loan from citizens to fund his war efforts, which indicates the seriousness of the situation. The Syracusan army at Himera is said to have numbered 50,000 foot and 5,000 horse – perhaps another exaggeration. The size of the army of Theron is not known. The main &quot;hoplite&quot; force came from the citizens of the Sicilian Greek cities. They were augmented by mercenary hoplites hired from Sicily and Italy, and even mainland Greece. Some of the citizens also served as &quot;peltasts&quot; while the wealthier citizens formed the cavalry units. Sicels and Sikan soldiers also served in the force. Mercenaries provided archers, slingers and cavalry.

==Himera campaign==
Hamilcar chose not to sail to Selinus and then attack Akragas, although it was the coast closest to Carthage. The Carthaginian fleet, escorted by 60 triremes, sailed to Panormus instead. Hamilcar chose this course probably because restoring Terrilus was his primary objective. The conquest of Sicily, if that indeed was a consideration, took second place to his duty as a guest and friend of Terrilus. The fleet was battered by storms at sea, losing the ships carrying the chariots and horses – which was a significant factor in the coming battle. The Greek fleet, able to muster 200 ships, did not contest the crossing, and in fact played no part in the coming battle.

===Carthaginian camps at Himera===
Hamilcar spent three days reorganizing his forces at Panormus, and repairing his battered fleet. The Carthaginians marched along the coast to Himera, with the fleet sailing alongside, and encamped near the city. Theron was already present in Himera with his army, but the Greeks did not interfere with Carthaginian operations. The Greek allies of Hamilcar (Greeks of Selinus and Anaxilas of Rhegion) were absent – and never joined the battle.

The city of Himera sits on top of a hill (300–400 feet high) on the western bank of the River Himera. The hill is steep in the northern, western and eastern sides but gradually slopes to the south. There are hills to the west and south of the city. The Carthaginians erected two camps near Himera. The sea camp was set to the north of Himera by the sea, surrounded by a palisade and a ditch. The army was billeted in a separate camp to the south on a low hill west of Himera. The land and sea camps were joined by siege works.

===Theron&#x27;s defeat and Gelo&#x27;s arrival===
It is not known if Hamilcar wished to build siege weapons at Himera or settle the issue through battle. After the camps were erected, the Punic ships dropped off provisions at the sea camp and were sent to Sardinia and Africa for more supplies. Twenty triremes patrolled the sea, the rest of the ships were beached in the sea camp. Himera was not fully invested – the east and south sides were open.

Hamilcar led a picked body of men on reconnaissance mission, and defeated the Greeks in a pitched battle outside Himera. The Greeks blocked the west gates of Himera and their morale also fell, while the Carthaginian foragers ranged the territory of Himera. Theron sent messages to Gelo, who arrived with his army and encamped across the river. Gelon&#x27;s cavalry managed to capture many of the foragers, as Hamilcar had no cavalry present to counter his moves. The morale in Himera improved, and the bricked-up gates were cleared on Gelo&#x27;s orders.

==Battle==
Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus give different versions of the battle, which are hard to reconcile. Diodorus provides a more detailed account.

===Herodotus on Himera===
The Greek and Punic armies fought from dawn to dusk, while Hamilcar watched the battle from his camp and offered sacrifices to Baal in a huge fire. No information on numbers, battle formation or battle site is given. When the Carthaginian army was routed towards dusk, Hamilcar jumped into the sacrificial fire. His body was never found and the Greeks erected a monument to his memory where he supposedly died. Herodotus noted that Sicilian tradition held that this battle and the battle of Salamis were fought on the same day.

===Diodorus Siculus and other sources===
The actions of the Greek cavalry in countering Carthaginian foragers prompted Hamilcar to send a letter to Selinus requesting them to send their cavalry to Himera on a given date that Hamilcar was to offer a sacrifice to Poseidon – a Greek deity whose worship probably required the presence of Greeks. The letter was intercepted by Gelo&#x27;s men. Gelo planned to use his own cavalry to impersonate the Selinute reinforcement and infiltrate the Carthaginian camp, while his army attacked the land camp.

====Greeks attack the land camp====
Gelo&#x27;s horsemen left their camp on the night before the appointed day, and at daybreak these horsemen arrived at the Carthaginian sea camp and were admitted into the camp. Greeks spotted them inside the Carthaginian camp from Himera and signaled Gelo. It is not known if the Syracusan army was inside Gelo&#x27;s camp or had assembled somewhere outside at that time. The Greeks marched around the south end of Himera and moved towards the Carthaginian land camp. Theron and his army stayed put in Himera. The Carthaginian army left their camp and formed up on the hill, forcing the Greeks to fight an uphill battle. The struggle was fierce and long and neither side gained any advantages.

====Death of Hamilcar====
Sometime after the battle was joined, the disguised Greek horsemen killed Hamilcar while he was preparing the sacrifice, and then set fire to the beached ships, causing great confusion at the sea camp. It is not known what further role the Greek cavalry played in the battle. The Carthaginians rushed to launch whatever ships they could save and some of the ships, overcrowded with soldiers, left the site altogether. When the news of Hamilcar&#x27;s death and the burning of ships reach the fighting armies, the Greeks pressed harder and routed the Carthaginians, who fled to their camp.

In an alternative version, Gelo ordered Pediarchos, his captain of archers, to &quot;dress as the tyrant&quot; to impersonate him and offer sacrifices in front of the camp. Pediarchos was surrounded by archers who had concealed bows in their dress while he impersonated Gelo. Hamilcar was obliged to come out to offer sacrifices also, and the bowmen shot him down.

====Theron takes action====
Gelo&#x27;s army stormed the Carthaginian camp and the Greeks scattered to loot the tents. The Iberians of the Carthaginian army reformed, and they attacked the now disordered Greeks, inflicting severe casualties. The Greeks fought back, but they were hard pressed and the Iberians got the upper hand in the struggle. At this critical juncture Theron decided to join the battle. He directed his attack on the flank and rear of the Iberian position inside the camp and also set fire to tents near them. The Iberians finally gave way, and retreated to the ships still afloat. Other Carthaginian survivors left the camp and retreated to a hill inland, where they attempted to defend themselves. The hill was waterless and they were ultimately forced to surrender. About half of the Carthaginian army and majority of the fleet was destroyed, numerous prisoners and rich booty had fallen into Greek hands. It is commented that the surviving Carthaginian ships were sunk in a storm on their return journey to Africa.

==Aftermath==
Gelo and Theron did not attack Rhegion or the Carthaginian territory in Sicily after the battle. Carthage initially manned the city walls and prepared for a Greek invasion of Africa, and did not renew the struggle either. Gelo offered mild terms to the Carthaginian embassy that arrived asking for a ceasefire. Carthage paid 2,000 silver talents as indemnity, erected two monuments in the memory of Himera, but lost no territory. Selinus and Rhegion also came to terms with Syracuse and Anaxilas married his daughter to Hieron I, brother of Gelo. The status quo before the battle was reestablished - Terrilus being the ultimate loser. Greek culture and trade flourished in Sicily. Gelo, Theron and Hieron built public buildings using the slaves and spoils gained from the battle, such as the Temple of Victory. An era of prosperity began, but infighting among the tyrants ensured that the peace was not unbroken. Carthage focused on expanding in Africa, leaving Sicily alone for 70 years. Apart from an obscure clash in 454 BC, the Greeks and Phoenicians left each other alone in Sicily.

Himera remained in the possession of Akragas until 472 BC. Theron expelled the Ionians after they attempted a coup and settled the city with Dorian Greeks. By 466 BC, the Sicilian Greek cities had broken away from the dominions of Gelo and Theron and had overthrown the tyrants&#x27; heirs, so in place of three Greek power blocs dominating Sicily (those of Syracuse, Akragas and Rhegion), eleven bickering Greek commonwealths came into being by 461 BC. They continued the Ionic/Doric feud in full force. Their actions ultimately led to the &quot;Second Sicilian War&quot; and the final destruction of Himera in 409 BC.

=== 2008 mass grave discovery ===
During the construction of a railway extension in 2008, near the site of the ancient Greek city of Himera, archeologists uncovered more than 10,000 burials. A number of those graves held the remains of 5th century BC soldiers. Researchers note that DNA sequencing determined that warriors who took part in second battle were mercenaries brought from as far as modern-day Ukraine and Latvia.

<doc id="745960" wikidata="Q651008" url="?curid=745960" title="Corinthian War">
<text>The Corinthian War (395–387 BC) was a conflict in ancient Greece which pitted Sparta against a coalition of city-states comprising Thebes, Athens, Corinth and Argos, backed by the Achaemenid Empire. The war was caused by dissatisfaction with Spartan imperialism in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), both from Athens, the defeated side in that conflict, and from Sparta&#x27;s former allies, Corinth and Thebes, who had not been properly rewarded. Taking advantage of the fact that the Spartan king Agesilaus II was away campaigning in Asia against the Achaemenid Empire, Thebes, Athens, Corinth and Argos forged an alliance in 395 BC with the goal of ending Spartan hegemony over Greece; the allies&#x27; war council was located in Corinth, which gave its name to the war. By the end of the conflict, the allies had failed to end Spartan hegemony over Greece, although Sparta was weakened by the war.

At first, the Spartans achieved several successes in pitched battles (at Nemea and Coroneia), but lost their advantage after their fleet was destroyed at the naval Battle of Cnidus against the Persian fleet, which effectively ended Sparta&#x27;s attempts to become a naval power. As a result, Athens launched several naval campaigns in the later years of the war, recapturing a number of islands that had been part of the original Delian League during the 5th century BC. Alarmed by these Athenian successes, the Persians stopped backing the allies and began supporting Sparta. This defection forced the allies to seek peace.

The King&#x27;s Peace, also known as the Peace of Antalcidas, was dictated by the Achaemenid King Artaxerxes II in 387 BC, ending the war. This treaty declared that Persia would control all of Ionia, and that all other Greek cities would be &quot;autonomous&quot;, in effect prohibiting them from forming leagues, alliances or coalitions. Sparta was to be the guardian of the peace, with the power to enforce its clauses. The effects of the war, therefore, were to establish Persia&#x27;s ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics, to atomize and isolate from one another Greek city states, and to affirm Sparta&#x27;s hegemonic position in the Greek political system. Thebes was the main loser of the war, as the Boeotian League was disbanded and their cities were garrisoned by Sparta. Peace did not last long: war between Sparta and a resentful Thebes resumed in 378 BC, which finally led to the destruction of Spartan hegemony at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC.

==Events leading to the war==
In the Peloponnesian War, which had ended in 404 BC, Sparta had enjoyed the support of nearly every mainland Greek state and the Achaemenid Empire, and in the months and years following that war, a number of the island states of the Aegean had come under its control. This solid base of support, however, was fragmented in the years following the war. Despite the collaborative nature of the victory, Sparta alone received the plunder taken from the defeated states and the tribute payments from the former Athenian Empire. Sparta&#x27;s allies were further alienated when, in 402 BC, Sparta attacked and subdued Elis, a member of the Peloponnesian League that had angered the Spartans during the course of the Peloponnesian War. Corinth and Thebes refused to send troops to assist Sparta in its campaign against Elis.

Thebes, Corinth and Athens also refused to participate in a Spartan expedition to Ionia in 398 BC, with the Thebans going so far as to disrupt a sacrifice that the Spartan king Agesilaus attempted to perform in their territory before his departure. Despite the absence of these states, Agesilaus campaigned effectively against the Persians in Lydia, advancing as far inland as Sardis. The satrap Tissaphernes was executed for his failure to contain Agesilaus, and his replacement, Tithraustes, bribed the Spartans to move north, into the satrapy of Pharnabazus, Hellespontine Phrygia. Agesilaus did so, but simultaneously began preparing a sizable navy.

Unable to defeat Agesilaus&#x27; army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to withdraw by stirring up trouble on the Greek mainland. He dispatched Timocrates of Rhodes, an Asiatic Greek, to distribute ten thousand gold darics in the major cities of the mainland and incite them to act against Sparta. Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions in each of those states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy. According to Plutarch, Agesilaus, the Spartan king, said upon leaving Asia &quot;I have been driven out by 10,000 Persian archers&quot;, a reference to &quot;Archers&quot; (&quot;Toxotai&quot;) the Greek nickname for the Darics from their obverse design, because that much money had been paid to politicians in Athens and Thebes in order to start a war against Sparta. The Thebans, who had previously demonstrated their antipathy towards Sparta, undertook to bring about a war.

Xenophon claims that, unwilling to challenge Sparta directly, the Thebans instead choose to precipitate a war by encouraging their allies, the Locrians, to collect taxes from territory claimed by both Locris and Phocis. In response, the Phocians invaded Locris, and ransacked Locrian territory. The Locrians appealed to Thebes for assistance, and the Thebans invaded Phocian territory; the Phocians, in turn, appealed to their ally, Sparta, and the Spartans, pleased to have a pretext to discipline the Thebans, ordered general mobilization. A Theban embassy was dispatched to Athens to request support; the Athenians voted to assist Thebes, and a perpetual alliance was concluded between Athens and the Boeotian confederacy.

The Spartan plan called for two armies, one under Lysander and the other under Pausanias, to rendezvous at and attack the Boeotian city of Haliartus. Lysander, arriving before Pausanias, successfully persuaded the city of Orchomenus to revolt from the Boeotian confederacy, and advanced to Haliartus with his troops and a force of Orchomenians. There, he was killed in the Battle of Haliartus after bringing his force too near the walls of the city; the battle ended inconclusively, with the Spartans suffering early losses but then defeating a group of Thebans who pursued the Spartans onto rough terrain where they were at a disadvantage. Pausanias, arriving a day later, took back the bodies of the Spartan dead under a truce, and returned to Sparta. There, he was put on trial for his life for failing to arrive and support Lysander at the designated time. He fled to Tegea before he could be convicted.

===Alliance against Sparta expands===
In the wake of these events, both the Spartans and their opponents prepared for more serious fighting to come. In late 395 BC, Corinth and Argos entered the war as co-belligerents with Athens and Thebes. A council was formed at Corinth to manage the affairs of this alliance. The allies then sent emissaries to a number of smaller states and received the support of many of them. Among the defections, there were: East Lokris, Thessaly, Leukas, Acarnania, Ambracia, Chalcidian Thrace, Euboea, Athamania, and Ainis. Meanwhile, the Boiotians and Argives captured Heraclea Trachinia. Only Phokis and Orchomenos remained loyal to Sparta in Central Greece.

Alarmed by these developments, the Spartans prepared to send out an army against this new alliance, and sent a messenger to Agesilaus ordering him to return to Greece. The orders were a disappointment to Agesilaus, who had looked forward to further successful campaigning. It is said he wryly observed, but for ten thousand Persian &quot;archers&quot;, he would have vanquished all Asia. Thus, he turned back with his troops, crossing the Hellespont and marched west through Thrace.

==War on land and sea (394 BC)==

===Nemea===
After a brief engagement between Thebes and Phocis, in which Thebes was victorious, the allies gathered a large army at Corinth. A sizable force was sent out from Sparta to challenge this force. The forces met at the dry bed of the Nemea River, in Corinthian territory, where the Spartans won a decisive victory. As often happened in hoplite battles, the right flank of each army was victorious, with the Spartans defeating the Athenians while the Thebans, Argives, and Corinthians defeated the various Peloponnesians opposite them; the Spartans then attacked and killed a number of Argives, Corinthians, and Thebans as these troops returned from pursuing the defeated Peloponnesians. The coalition army lost 2,800 men, while the Spartans and their allies lost only 1,100.

===Cnidus===
The next major action of the war took place at sea, where both the Persians and the Spartans had assembled large fleets during Agesilaus&#x27;s campaign in Asia. By levying ships from the Aegean states under his control, Agesilaus had raised a force of 120 triremes, which he placed under the command of his brother-in-law Peisander, who had never held a command of this nature before. The Persians, meanwhile, had already assembled a joint Phoenician, Cilician, and Cypriot fleet, under the joint command of Achaemenid satrap Pharnabazus II and the experienced Athenian admiral Conon who was in self-exile and in the service of the Achaemenids after his infamous defeat at the Battle of Aegospotami. The fleet had already seized Rhodes from Spartan control in 396 BC.


These two fleets met off the point of Cnidus in 394 BC. The Spartans fought determinedly, particularly in the vicinity of Peisander&#x27;s ship, but were eventually overwhelmed; large numbers of ships were sunk or captured, and the Spartan fleet was essentially wiped from the sea. Following this victory, Conon and Pharnabazus sailed along the coast of Ionia, expelling Spartan governors and garrisons from the cities of Kos, Nisyros, Telos, Chios, Mytilene, Ephesos, Erythrae, although they failed to reduce the Spartan bases at Abydos and Sestos under the command of Dercylidas, as well as the small bases of Aigai and Temnos. Apart from Mytilene, Lesbos also remained pro-Spartan. Based on numismatic evidence, the cities of Rhodes, Iasos, Knidos, Ephesos, Samos, Byzantium, Kyzikos, and Lampsakos, likely made an alliance against Sparta after the battle of Cnidus.

===Coronea===

By this time, Agesilaus&#x27;s army, after brushing off attacks from the Thessalians during its march through that country, had arrived in Boeotia, where it was met by an army gathered from the various states of the anti-Spartan alliance. Agesilaus&#x27;s force from Asia, composed largely of emancipated helots and mercenary veterans of the Ten Thousand, was augmented by half a Spartan regiment from Orchomenus, and another half a regiment that had been transported across the Gulf of Corinth. These armies met each other at Coronea, in Theban territory; as at Nemea, both right wings were victorious, with the Thebans breaking through while the rest of the allies were defeated. Seeing that the rest of their force had been defeated, the Thebans formed up to break back through to their camp. Agesilaus met their force head on, and in the struggle that followed a number of Thebans were killed before the remainder were able to force their way through and rejoin their allies. After this victory, Agesilaus sailed with his army across the Gulf of Corinth and returned to Sparta.
==Later events (393–388 BC)==
The events of 394 BC left the Spartans with the upper hand on land, but weak at sea. The coalition states had been unable to defeat the Spartan phalanx in the field, but had kept their alliance strong and prevented the Spartans from moving at will through central Greece. The Spartans would continue to attempt, over the next several years, to knock either Corinth or Argos out of the war; the anti-Spartan allies, meanwhile, sought to preserve their united front against Sparta, while Athens and Thebes took advantage of Sparta&#x27;s preoccupation to enhance their own power in areas they had traditionally dominated.

===Achaemenid naval campaign and assistance to Athens (393 BC)===
====Naval raids in Ionia====
Pharnabazus followed up his victory at Cnidus by capturing several Spartan-allied cities in Ionia, instigating pro-Athenian and pro-Democracy movements. Abydus and Sestus were the only cities to refuse to expel the Lacedemonians despite threats from Pharnabazus to make war on them. He attempted to force these into submission by ravaging the surrounding territory, but this proved fruitless, leading him to leave Conon in charge of winning over the cities in the Hellespont.

====Naval raids on the Peloponnesian coast====
From 393 BC, Pharnabazus II and Conon sailed with their fleet to the Aegean island of Melos and established a base there. This was the first time in 90 years, since the Greco-Persian Wars, that the Achaemenid fleet was going so far west. The military occupation by these pro-Athenian forces led to several democratic revolutions and new alliances with Athens in the islands.

The fleet proceeded further west to take revenge on the Spartans by invading Lacedaemonian territory, where they laid waste to Pherae and raided along the Messenian coast. Their aim was probably to instigate a revolt of the Messanian helots against Sparta. Eventually they left due to scarce resources and few harbors for the Achaemenid fleet in the area, as well as the looming possibility of Lacedaemonian relief forces being dispatched.

They then raided the coast of Laconia and seized the island of Cythera, where they left a garrison and an Athenian governor to cripple Sparta&#x27;s offensive military capabilities. Cythera in effect became Achaemenid territory. Seizing Cythera also had the effect of cutting the strategic route between Peloponnesia and Egypt and thus avoiding Spartan-Egyptian collusion, and directly threatening Taenarum, the harbour of Sparta. This strategy to threaten Sparta had already been recommended, in vain, by the exiled Spartan Demaratus to Xerxes I in 480 BC.

Pharnabazus II, leaving part of his fleet in Cythera, then went to Corinth, where he gave Sparta&#x27;s rivals funds to further threaten the Lacedaemonians. He also funded the rebuilding of a Corinthian fleet to resist the Spartans.

====Rebuilding of the walls of Athens====
After being convinced by Conon that allowing him to rebuild the Long Walls around Piraeus, the main port of Athens, would be a major blow to the Lacedaemonians, Pharnabazus eagerly gave Conon a fleet of 80 triremes and additional funds to accomplish this task. Pharnabazus dispatched Conon with substantial funds and a large part of the fleet to Attica, where he joined in the rebuilding of the long walls from Athens to Piraeus, a project that had been initiated by Thrasybulus in 394 BC. With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet, and the workers paid for by the Persian money, the construction was soon completed.

Xenophon in his &quot;Hellenica&quot; gives a vivid contemporary account of this endeavour: 
Athens quickly took advantage of its possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of Scyros, Imbros, and Lemnos, on which it established cleruchies (citizen colonies).

As a reward for his success, Pharnabazus was allowed to marry the king&#x27;s daughter. He was recalled to the Achaemenid Empire in 393 BC, and replaced by satrap Tiribazus.

====Civil strife at Corinth====
At about this time, civil strife broke out in Corinth between the democratic party and the oligarchic party. The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their opponents, and the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to the Spartans, based at this time at Sicyon, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats. In a night attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth&#x27;s port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off.

===Peace conferences break down===
In 392 BC, the Spartans dispatched an ambassador, Antalcidas, to the satrap Tiribazus, hoping to turn the Persians against the allies by informing them of Conon&#x27;s use of the Persian fleet to begin rebuilding the Athenian empire. The Athenians learned of this, and sent Conon and several others to present their case to the Persians; they also notified their allies, and Argos, Corinth, and Thebes dispatched embassies to Tiribazus. At the conference that resulted, the Spartans proposed a peace based on the independence of all states; this was rejected by the allies, as Athens wished to hold the gains it had made in the Aegean, Thebes wished to keep its control over the Boeotian league, and Argos already had designs on assimilating Corinth into its state. The conference thus failed, but Tiribazus, alarmed by Conon&#x27;s actions, arrested him, and secretly provided the Spartans with money to equip a fleet. Although Conon quickly escaped, he died soon afterward. A second peace conference was held at Sparta in the same year, but the proposals made there were again rejected by the allies, both because of the implications of the autonomy principle and because the Athenians were outraged that the terms proposed would have involved abandoning the Ionian Greeks to Persia.

In the wake of the unsuccessful conference in Persia, Tiribazus returned to Susa to report on events, and a new general, Struthas, was sent out to take command. Struthas pursued an anti-Spartan policy, prompting the Spartans to order their commander in the region, Thibron, to attack him. Thibron successfully ravaged Persian territory for a time, but was killed along with much of his army when Struthas ambushed one of his poorly organized raiding expeditions. Thibron was later replaced by Diphridas, who raided more successfully, securing a number of small successes and even capturing Struthas&#x27;s son-in-law, but never achieved any dramatic results.

===Lechaeum and the seizure of Corinth===
At Corinth, the democratic party continued to hold the city proper, while the exiles and their Spartan supporters held Lechaeum, from where they raided the Corinthian countryside. In 391 BC, Agesilaus campaigned in the area, successfully seizing several fortified points, along with a large number of prisoners and amounts of booty. While Agesilaus was in camp preparing to sell off his spoils, the Athenian general Iphicrates, with a force composed almost entirely of light troops and peltasts (javelin throwers), won a decisive victory against the Spartan regiment that had been stationed at Lechaeum in the Battle of Lechaeum. During the battle, Iphicrates took advantage of the Spartans&#x27; lack of peltasts to repeatedly harass the regiment with hit-and-run attacks, wearing the Spartans down until they broke and ran, at which point a number of them were slaughtered. Agesilaus returned home shortly after these events, but Iphicrates continued to campaign around Corinth, recapturing many of the strong points which the Spartans had previously taken, although he was unable to retake Lechaeum. He also campaigned against Phlius and Arcadia, decisively defeating the Phliasians and plundering the territory of the Arcadians when they refused to engage his troops.

After this victory, an Argive army came to Corinth, and, seizing the acropolis, effected the merger of Argos and Corinth. The border stones between Argos and Corinth were torn down, and the citizen bodies of the two cities were merged.

===Later land campaigns===
After Iphicrates&#x27;s victories near Corinth, no more major land campaigns were conducted in that region. Campaigning continued in the Peloponnese and the northwest. Agesilaus had campaigned successfully in Argive territory in 391 BC, and he launched two more major expeditions before the end of the war. In the first of these, in 389 BC, a Spartan expeditionary force crossed the Gulf of Corinth to attack Acarnania, an ally of the anti-Spartan coalition. After initial difficulties in coming to grips with the Acarnanians, who kept to the mountains and avoided engaging him directly, Agesilaus was eventually able to draw them into a pitched battle, in which the Acarnanians were routed and lost a number of men. He then sailed home across the Gulf. The next year, the Acarnanians made peace with the Spartans to avoid further invasions.

In 388 BC, Agesipolis led a Spartan army against Argos. Since no Argive army challenged him, he plundered the countryside for a time, and then, after receiving several unfavorable omens, returned home.

===Later campaigns in the Aegean===
After their defeat at Cnidus, the Spartans began to rebuild a fleet, and, in fighting with Corinth, had regained control of the Gulf of Corinth by 392 BC. Following the failure of the peace conferences of 392 BC, the Spartans sent a small fleet, under the commander Ecdicus, to the Aegean with orders to assist oligarchs exiled from Rhodes. Ecdicus arrived at Rhodes to find the democrats fully in control, and in possession of more ships than him, and thus waited at Cnidus. The Spartans then dispatched their fleet from the Gulf of Corinth, under Teleutias, to assist. After picking up more ships at Samos, Teleutias took command at Cnidus and commenced operations against Rhodes.

Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians sent out a fleet of 40 triremes under Thrasybulus. He, judging that he could accomplish more by campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly, sailed to the Hellespont. Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past Byzantium, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to Lesbos, where, with the support of the Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won over a number of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.

After this, the Spartans sent out a new commander, Anaxibius, to Abydos. For a time, he enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus, and seized a number of Athenian merchant ships. Worried that Thrasybulus&#x27;s accomplishments were being undermined, the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other&#x27;s territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against Antandrus, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius and his men, who were strung out in the line of march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and his men were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.

===Aegina and Piraeus===
In 389 BC, the Athenians attacked the island of Aegina, off the coast of Attica. The Spartans soon drove off the Athenian fleet, but the Athenians continued their land assault. Under Antalcidas&#x27; command, the Spartan fleet sailed east to Rhodes but it was eventually blockaded at Abydos by the regional Athenian commanders. The Athenians on Aegina, meanwhile, soon found themselves under attack, and withdrew after several months.

Shortly thereafter, the Spartan fleet under Gorgopas ambushed the Athenian fleet near Athens, capturing several ships. The Athenians responded with an ambush of their own; Chabrias, on his way to Cyprus, landed his troops on Aegina and laid an ambush for the Aeginetans and their Spartan allies, killing a number of them including Gorgopas.

The Spartans then sent Teleutias to Aegina to command the fleet there. Noticing that the Athenians had relaxed their guard after Chabrias&#x27;s victory, he launched a raid on Piraeus, seizing numerous merchant ships.

==The King&#x27;s Peace (387 BC)==

Antalcidas, meanwhile, had entered into negotiations with Tiribazus, and reached an agreement under which the Persians would enter into the war on the Spartan side if the allies refused to make peace. It appears that the Persians, unnerved by certain actions of Athens, including supporting king Evagoras of Cyprus and Akoris of Egypt, both of whom were at war with Persia, had decided that their policy of weakening Sparta by supporting its enemies was no longer useful. After escaping from the blockade at Abydos, Antalcidas attacked and defeated a small Athenian force, then united his fleet with a supporting fleet sent from Syracuse. With this force, which was soon further augmented with ships supplied by the satraps of the region, he sailed to the Hellespont, where he could cut off the trade routes that brought grain to Athens. The Athenians, mindful of their similar defeat in the Peloponnesian War less than two decades before, were ready to make peace.

In this climate, when Tiribazus called a peace conference in late 387 BC, the major parties of the war were ready to discuss terms. The basic outline of the treaty was laid out by a decree from the Persian king Artaxerxes:
King Artaxerxes thinks it just that the cities in Asia should belong to him, as well as Clazomenae and Cyprus among the islands, and that the other Greek cities, both small and great, should be left (&quot;αὐτονόμους&quot;), except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros; and these should belong, as of old, to the Athenians. But whichever of the two parties does not accept this peace, upon them I will make war, in company with those who desire this arrangement, both by land and by sea, with ships and with money.

According to the terms of this peace treaty:

# all of Asia Minor, with the islands of Clazomenae and Cyprus, was recognized as subject to Persia,
# all the Greek city states were to be &quot;autonomous&quot; (&quot;αὐτονόμους&quot; in the text), meaning prohibited from forming leagues or alliances, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which were returned to the Athenians.

In a general peace conference at Sparta, the Spartans, with their authority enhanced by the threat of Persian intervention, secured the acquiescence of all the major states of Greece to these terms. The terms were ratified by the city governments over the next year. The reassertion of Spartan hegemony over Greece by abandoning the Greeks of Aeolia, Ionia, and Caria has been called the &quot;most disgraceful event in Greek history&quot;.

The agreement eventually produced was commonly known as the King&#x27;s Peace, reflecting the Persian influence the treaty showed. This treaty placed Greece under Persian suzerainty and marked the first attempt at a Common Peace in Greek history; under the treaty, all cities were to be autonomous, a clause that would be enforced by the Spartans as guardians of the peace. Under threat of Spartan intervention, Thebes disbanded its league, and Argos and Corinth ended their experiment in shared government; Corinth, deprived of its strong ally, was incorporated back into Sparta&#x27;s Peloponnesian League. After 8 years of fighting, the Corinthian war was at an end.

==Aftermath==
In the years following the signing of the peace, the two states responsible for its structure, Persia and Sparta, took full advantage of the gains they had made. Persia, freed of both Athenian and Spartan interference in its Asian provinces, consolidated its hold over the eastern Aegean and captured both Egypt and Cyprus by 380 BC. Sparta, meanwhile, in its newly formalized position atop the Greek political system, took advantage of the autonomy clause of the peace to break up any coalition that it perceived as a threat. Disloyal allies were sharply punished—Mantinea, for instance, was broken up into five component villages. With Agesilaus at the head of the state, advocating for an aggressive policy, the Spartans campaigned from the Peloponnese to the distant Chalcidic peninsula. Their dominance over mainland Greece would last another sixteen years before being shattered at Leuctra.

The war also marked the beginning of Athens&#x27; resurgence as a power in the Greek world. With their walls and their fleet restored, the Athenians were in position to turn their eyes overseas. By the middle of the 4th century, they had assembled an organization of Aegean states commonly known as the Second Athenian League, regaining at least parts of what they had lost with their defeat in 404 BC.

The freedom of the Ionian Greeks had been a rallying cry since the beginning of the 5th century, but after the Corinthian War, the mainland states made no further attempts to interfere with Persia&#x27;s control of the region. After over a century of disruption and struggle, Persia at last ruled western Anatolia without disruption or intervention for over 50 years, until the time of Alexander the Great.

<text>The Battle of Coronea in 394 BC, also Battle of Coroneia, took place during the Corinthian War, in which the Spartans and their allies under King Agesilaus II defeated a force of Thebans and Argives that was attempting to block their march back into the Peloponnese. It ranks among the deadliest of the Hoplite battles, despite its comparative obscurity, when matched up against more famous battles like the Battle of Delium in 424, and the Battle of Mantinea in 362.

==Prelude==
The Corinthian War began in 395 BC when Thebes, Argos, Corinth, and Athens, with Persian support and funding, united to oppose Spartan intervention in Locris and Phocis. At the start of the war, Agesilaus was in Ionia, campaigning against the Persians. When hostilities opened, he was recalled with his forces, and began an overland march through Thrace and central Greece back to the Peloponnese. Entering Boeotia, he was opposed by a force composed primarily of Thebans, allied Boeotians, and Argives.

Agesilaus&#x27;s forces were composed of a regiment and a half of Spartiates, augmented by a force of freed helots, a sizable force of allied troops from the Peloponnese and Ionia, and a large contingent of mercenaries. Facing him on the plain, near the foot of Mount Helicon, was an army made up of Boeotians, Athenians, Argives, Corinthians, Euboeans, and Locrians. In all, the allies probably had 20,000 hoplites. To oppose these, Agesilaus had 15,000 hoplites. The cavalry forces of the two sides were roughly equal, but Agesilaus had substantially more peltasts.

Prior to the battle some of Agesilaus&#x27;s army were disturbed by an omen witnessed some days before, when the sun had appeared crescent shaped. To reassure his men, Agesilaus first reminded them of the recent Spartan victory at Nemea. He then told them that the Spartan navarch Peisander had been killed in a victory over the Persian fleet. In fact, as Agesilaus knew, Peisander had been killed while suffering a crushing defeat at Cnidus. These reassurances, however, buoyed his army&#x27;s morale going into the battle.

The defeat at Nemea weighed heavily on the Argives and Corinthians. The Athenians were too familiar with the ups and downs of their previous long and disastrous war against Sparta, and the willingness of the Persians to switch support from one side to the other, to be overly encouraged. Only the Boeotians seemed confident of ultimate victory.

==Battle==
As the two armies approached each other, Agesilaus himself commanded the Spartans on the extreme right flank of his army, the veterans of the &quot;Ten Thousand&quot; were next to the Spartans, the Asian Greeks were next to them, then came the Phocians, and the Orchomenians held the extreme left flank. The Thebans faced the Orchomenians and the Argives faced the Spartans. Both armies advanced in total silence. At about , the Thebans shouted their war cry and charged at the run. At about , the veterans of the &quot;Ten Thousand&quot; (under the Spartiate Herippidas) and the Asian Greeks charged the troops opposite them at the run. The veterans and the Asians quickly routed the troops opposite them. The Argives panicked even before the Spartans under Agesilaus could make contact and fled to Mount Helicon.

The mercenaries near Agesilaus assumed the battle was over and offered him a garland to commemorate his victory. Just then news came that on the other flank, the Thebans had broken through the Orchomenians and were already at the baggage train, ransacking the loot taken from Asia. Agesilaus immediately wheeled his phalanx around and headed for the Thebans. At that moment, the Thebans noticed that their allies had fled to Mount Helicon. They formed up with the desperate design of breaking through Agesilaus&#x27;s lines to rejoin the rest of their army.

Agesilaus decided to oppose them by putting his phalanx directly in their path instead of taking them in the rear or flank, a decision that may have been influenced by his longstanding animosity towards Thebes. What followed was evidently one of the worst blood baths in the history of hoplite battles. As Xenophon described it, “So shield pressed upon shield they struggled, killed and were killed in turn.” In the end, a few Thebans broke through to Mount Helicon but, in the words of Xenophon, “many others were killed on their way there.”

==Aftermath==
Agesilaus himself had been wounded in the battle and had to be carried back to the phalanx. There some cavalry rode up, informing him that about 80 of the enemy had taken refuge in a nearby temple. Agesilaus ordered that they be spared and allowed to go wherever they wished. The next morning, Agesilaus ordered the polemarch Gylis to put the army in battle formation and gave out awards for valour, received a delegation from the Thebans and allowed them to collect their dead. The army then retired to Phocis and invaded Locris where the polemarch Gylis was killed.

According to Diodorus Siculus, more than 600 of the Boeotians and their allies fell, and the Spartans lost 350 men.

<text>The Battle of Cnidus () was a military operation conducted in 394 BC by the Achaemenid Empire against the Spartan fleet during the Corinthian War. A fleet under the joint command of Pharnabazus and former Athenian admiral, Conon, destroyed the Spartan fleet led by the inexperienced Peisander, ending Sparta&#x27;s brief bid for naval supremacy.

The battle outcome was a significant boost for the anti-Spartan coalition that resisted Spartan hegemony in the course of the Corinthian War.

==Prelude==
In 394 BC, King Agesilaus II of Sparta and his army were recalled from Ionia to help fight the Corinthian War. The Spartan fleet, under Peisander, also began a return to Greece, sailing out from its harbor at Cnidus with eighty-five triremes.

The &quot;Greek&quot; vanguard of the Achaemenid fleet, referred to as such only due to its consisting of Greek mercenaries, was commanded by Conon, while the Persian satrap Pharnabazus led the main body of the forces, a Phoenician fleet from the Chersonese, to oppose the Spartans. The fleets met near Cnidus. According to Isocrates, King Evagoras I of Cyprus contributed the greatest part of the forces under Conon for the sea fight off Cnidus.

==Battle==
Sources are vague for the events of the battle itself. It appears that the Spartan fleet encountered advance elements of the Achaemenid fleet under Conon and engaged them with some success. Then the main body of the Persian fleet arrived and put the Spartans to flight, forcing them to beach many of their ships. The Spartans suffered heavy casualties; according to Diodorus Siculus, fifty Spartan triremes were captured by the Persians while the remaining triremes safely returned to Cnidus. Peisander saw retreat as disgraceful towards Sparta and was ultimately killed while fighting to defend his ship.

==Aftermath==
This battle ended the Spartans&#x27; attempt to establish a naval empire. Sparta never again engaged in major military efforts at sea, and within a few years Athens had reclaimed her place as the preeminent Greek sea power.

Following his victory, Conon raided the coast of the Peloponnese with Pharnabazus in order to put pressure on Sparta, and then was sent with his fleet to Athens, where he supervised the rebuilding of the long walls, which had been destroyed at the end of the Peloponnesian War. According to Pausanias, Conon commemorated the victory by establishing a sanctuary of Aphrodite (the patron goddess of Cnidus and a key deity for the Phoenicians) in Piraeus.

With Sparta removed from the scene, Persia re-established its dominance over Ionia and parts of the Aegean. The Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC officially ceded control of these areas to Persia; it would continue to hold them until the arrival of Alexander the Great half a century later.

<text>The Battle of Mantinea was fought on 4 July 362 BC between the Thebans, led by Epaminondas and supported by the Arcadians, Argives, Messenians, Thessalians, and the Boeotian league against the Spartans, led by King Agesilaus II and supported by the Eleans, Athenians, Euboeans, and Mantineans. The battle was to determine which of the two alliances would dominate Greece. However, the death of Epaminondas and his intended successors would cost Thebes the military leadership and initiative to maintain Theban supremacy in the region. Similarly, the Spartans were weakened by yet another defeat and loss of troops. Epaminondas&#x27; death coupled with the impact on the Spartans of yet another defeat weakened both alliances, and paved the way for Macedonian conquest led by Philip II of Macedon.

== Background ==

During the Peloponnesian War (431–404 B.C.), Thebes allied with the Spartans against Athens. After Sparta&#x27;s victory against Athens, the Thebans were told that their forts were to be garrisoned by Spartan troops. This decision changed the relationship between Thebes and Sparta from one of allyship to one of occupation by the Spartans. Greek General and Statesman Epaminondas (in some sources spelt Epameinondas) headed a revolt against the garrison of Spartan troops in Boeotian territory in 378 B.C. A significant blow to Spartan hegemony occurred during the Battle of Leuctra in 371 B.C., where Epaminondas stacked his left flank 50 men deep with elite Theban Soldiers of the Sacred Band led by General Pelopidas in anticipation that the Spartans&#x27; strongest soldiers would traditionally be stacked on the right flank. This strategy proved fruitful for Thebes as the battle cost the lives of many Spartans, including King Cleombrotus. The battle of Leuctra &quot;led, undeniably, to a wholly different world, in which the Spartans were badly weakened and Thebans wildly emboldened.&quot;

After the Battle of Leuctra in 371 B.C. had shattered the foundations of Spartan hegemony, Thebes&#x27; chief politician and general Epaminondas attempted to build a new hegemony centered around Thebes. General Epaminondas had served both as a statesman and a Theban general from 420 B.C. to his death during battle in 362 B.C. Epaminondas had been highly regarded for his military prowess and his tendency to promote virtues such as simplicity and perseverance. The historian Diodorus Siculus made claim that after the Battle of Leuctra, Epaminondas &quot;became the foremost man, not only of Thebes, but of all who lived in his time&quot;. Due to the high regard from his subjects and recent military victory, Epaminondas sought to continue to expand and establish Theban supremacy. Consequently, the Thebans had marched south into the area traditionally dominated by the Spartans and set up the Arcadian League, a federation of city-states of the central Peloponnesian plateau to contain Spartan influence in the Peloponnese and thereby maintain overall Theban control. At the behest of the Arcadian League in 370 B.C., Epaminondas led a winter campaign in Laconia, plundering the countryside while King Agesilaus II could only watch in Sparta. Epaminondas ended this campaign by repopulating Messene, the capital of Messenia, fortifying it with the finest stone walls in all of Greece, causing Sparta to be surrounded with enemies on all sides. Subsequently, a Persian diplomatic intervention in 368 B.C. spearheaded by Artaxerxes II attempted to negotiate peace among the Greeks, but Sparta desired to continue the war to regain Messenia, while Thebes desired to conquer all of Boeotia, ending any chance of successful negotiations.

Beginning in 367 B.C., Epaminondas led a bloodless expedition into Achaea with Argive support, installing pro-Theban factions and Theban governors in the region, but these regimes were quickly replaced by Achaean aristocrats who aligned themselves with Sparta as soon as Epaminondas left Achaea.

In years prior to the Battle of Mantinea, the Spartans had joined with the Eleans (a minor Peloponnesian people with a territorial grudge against the Arcadians) in an effort to undermine the League. When the Arcadians seized the Pan-Hellenic sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia in Elis and celebrated the Olympic Games in 364 B.C., the Eleans counterattacked and instilled fear into the Arcadians. In the aftermath of this incident, one of the Arcadian city-states, Mantinea, passed a resolution to stop funding the elite &quot;epariti&quot; with funds from the sanctuary, causing the attempted ejection of Mantinea from the league and eventual disillusionment of Mantinea with the Arcadian League and Thebes. Diplomatically isolated, the Mantineans sent envoys to Athens and Sparta, causing them to join the Mantineans in a military attack on the Arcadian League, rallying at Mantinea. Athens decided to support the Spartans, as they resented the growing Theban power. The Athenians also recalled that at the end of Peloponnesian War, the Thebans had demanded that Athens be destroyed and its inhabitants enslaved; the Spartans had resisted these demands. An Athenian army was sent by sea to join the Spartan-led forces, in order to avoid being intercepted on land by Theban forces. Epaminondas then led a Theban army into the Peloponnese to restore order and re-establish Theban/Arcadian hegemony there. Knowing that Sparta was undefended due to their troops assembling at Mantinea, Epaminondas led an unsuccessful sneak attack into Sparta in 362 B.C., foiled by a Cretan who happened to witness the Theban march and encounter Agesilaus, warning him of the attack. Defeated at Sparta, Epaminondas retreated to Tegea, where his allies assembled. 
== Battle ==

=== Initial skirmish ===
While his army camped in Tegea, Epaminondas sent his cavalry to Mantinea with a mission to raze and plunder the Mantinean countryside. However, the Mantineans begged the Athenian cavalry, who had just stopped at nearby Cleonae for recuperation, to attack the Theban cavalry. Despite being tired and hungry, the Athenian cavalry rode out to Mantinea and successfully engaged the Thebans in a bitter skirmish in which many Athenians, including Gryllus, son of Xenophon, died before routing the Thebans. Due to the consecutive setbacks the Thebans faced so far in this campaign, Epaminondas is said to have believed that he must regain his honor through winning a decisive battle. Xenophon wrote that Epaminondas believed that, since he had so far been unsuccessful in this campaign, &quot;if he were victorious, he would make up for all these things, while if he were slain, he deemed that such an end would be honourable for one who was striving to leave to his fatherland dominion over Peloponnesus.&quot;

=== Main action ===
The two armies met near Mantinea in a flat plain hemmed in by two mountains. The Spartans, Athenians, Eleans and Mantineans, alongside smaller contingents of some of the Achaeans and Euboeans, were led by the Spartan king, Agesilaus II, who was assisted by Podares of Mantinea and Cephisodorus of Marathon, the commander of the Athenian cavalry. The strength of the Spartan alliance numbered at 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, with the Athenians contributing 6,000 and the Spartans contributing 1,000. Epaminondas&#x27; Thebans were assisted by the Arcadians loyal to the League, principally those from the city-states of Megalopolis (founded by the Thebans when they were last in the Peloponnese, as the Arcadian federal capital) and Tegea (the traditional leading city-state of the Arcadians), with additional support from most of the Achaeans, Argives, Messenians, and Thessalians. The Theban army included contingents from city-states of the pro-Theban Boeotian League. The Theban cavalry was supported by lightly armed running infantry, known as &quot;hamippoi&quot;, integrated into the cavalry formation. 

Epaminondas maneuvered his army to the west near some mountains, a position that was likely the modern day site of Skopi, giving the impression among his enemies that his army would not battle that day and begin to make camp. Secretly, Epaminondas began to reorganize his formation, moving troops behind other soldiers so that the enemy would not be able to see. He concentrated his best Boeotian troops onto his left in a large phalanx, probably fifty ranks deep. The Arcadians formed their phalanxes on the immediate right of the Boeotians, the Argives held the right, and the rest of the allies filled the middle, with cavalry on the flanks. Ordering his army to advance with the left marching faster than the right, Epaminondas arranged an oblique order attack with the strong Boeotian wedge to break the Spartan right while the enemy army was under the impression that there would be no battle. This tactic allowed the large, dense section of the line to force its way through the thinner classical phalanx. Epaminondas personally led the left from the front line. Xenophon (&quot;Hellenika&quot; 7.5.23) described the left wing of that Theban army as &quot;like a trireme, with the spur of the prow out in front.&quot;

The Theban cavalry and light infantry drove off the enemy cavalry. The wedged Boeotian hoplites smashed into the enemy right, where the Mantineans were positioned. The Mantinean leader Podares offered heroic resistance, but when he was killed, the Mantinean hoplites fled the field. However, as the Mantineans fled, the Spartans made a last-ditch effort to kill Epaminondas before fleeing by throwing their javelins at him, some of which struck his body. Epaminondas was mortally wounded when facing the Spartan phalanx by a man variously identified as Anticrates, Machaerion, or Gryllus, son of Xenophon. Epaminondas&#x27; soldiers rescued him as he was dying, placing him at the high point of Skopi, where he watched the battle unfold. The Theban leaders Iolaidas and Daiphantus, whom he intended to succeed him, were also killed. After the death of Epaminondas, the Theban left froze and failed to pursue the retreating Spartans and Mantineans. Meanwhile on the Theban right, the Theban cavalry was also victorious against the Spartan cavalry and pursued the retreating Spartan cavalry, but the &quot;hamippoi&quot; attached to the Theban right hastily attacked the Athenian hoplites in euphoria and were slaughtered by the Athenians. The Athenians remained as the only contingent of the Spartan army to hold their ground.
According to Polyaenus, after the battle, the Mantineians wanted to send heralds to the Thebans in order to make an agreement about carrying off the dead, but Cineas persuaded them against such an action.

==Aftermath==

Thebes was struck a heavy blow to their supremacy despite the victory on the battlefield because Epaminondas had been slain. On his deathbed, Epaminondas, upon hearing of the deaths of his fellow leaders, instructed the Thebans to make peace, despite having won the battle. Without his leadership and military capabilities, Theban hopes for hegemony faded. The Spartans, however, having again been defeated in battle, were unable to replace their losses. Since many elite Spartan warriors were slain during the battle, Sparta&#x27;s military strength was greatly weakened by the conflict. This was because it would take years of training, experience, and resources to produce the seasoned veterans lost in the battle, thus the remnants of the military were left in the hands of the less experienced.

Contemporary historians, such as Xenophon and Ephorus, were disappointed in the indecisive nature of the battle despite the assemblage of the greatest cities of Greece into a single battle. Ancient Greek historiography, focused on a long tradition of sectioning history into epochs, could not make sense of the historical significance of the Battle of Mantinea due to the lack of political or territorial changes the battle brought. The failure for a single hegemon to develop from this battle convinced writers like Xenophon to come to the conclusion that Greece inherently existed in a state of disorder and no clear hegemon would ever emerge.

The ultimate result of the battle was to pave the way for the Macedonian rise as the leading force who subjugated the rest of Greece by exploiting the weakness of both the Thebans and the Spartans. This was because from 368–365 B.C. Phillip II of Macedon was held captive in Thebes, in which he became mentored by Epaminondas. Under Epaminondas&#x27; wing, Phillip was able to earn a military education in Epaminondas&#x27; successful unconventional (at the time) styles of warfare. In 364 B.C., Phillip returned to Macedon. Thereafter he would utilize his military skills to dominate Greece.

<doc id="745987" wikidata="Q1330631" url="?curid=745987" title="Pherae">
<text>Pherae (Greek: Φεραί) was a city and polis (city-state) in southeastern Ancient Thessaly. One of the oldest Thessalian cities, it was located in the southeast corner of Pelasgiotis. According to Strabo, it was near Lake Boebeïs 90 stadia from Pagasae, its harbor on the Gulf of Pagasae (Geography 9.5). The site is in the modern community of Velestino.

In Homer Pherae was the home of King Admetus and his wife, Alcestis, (whom Heracles went into Hades to rescue), as well as their son Eumelus (who was one of the suitors of Helen and led the Achaean forces of Pherae and Iolcus in the Trojan War) (Iliad 2.711; Odyssey 4.798). 

Thucydides lists Pherae among the early Thessalian supporters of Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War (History of the Peloponnesian War 2.22). Toward the end of the war Lycophron established a tyranny at Pherae. On his death his son Jason became dictator and by around 374 BC extended his rule throughout Thessaly. After Jason&#x27;s assassination and that of his successor, Polydorus, Alexander ruled Pherae with great harshness until he was killed by his wife, Thebe, in 359 BC, and Thessaly was conquered by the Thebans. Philip of Macedon conquered Pherae in 352 BC and subjected Thessaly to Macedonian rule.

In Roman times Pherae was conquered by Antiochus the Great of Syria in 191 BC, but lost it that same year to the Roman consul of the year Manius Acilius Glabrio (Livy 36.1-14). The famous Messeis spring (the spring of Kefalovryso at Velestino) was probably at Pherae (Strabo, Geography 9.5; Iliad 6.457).

<doc id="745988" wikidata="Q4791414" url="?curid=745988" title="Arizona State Prison Complex – Lewis">
<text>Arizona State Prison Complex – Lewis, one of 13 prison facilities operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) is in Buckeye, Maricopa County, Arizona, 43 miles west of the state capital of Phoenix.

==Naming==
Each of ASPC-Lewis&#x27;s housing units is named after an ADC correctional officer killed in the line of duty:

* Sandra Bachman
* Theodore Buckley
* Robert Barchey
* Dale Morey
* Paul Rast
* Jim Stiner

ASPC-Lewis is a modern, medium-security prison built by both commercial and convict labor. It has an inmate capacity of over 5,000 in 7 units, at level 2, 3, 4, and a MAX custody security level. The ADC uses a score classification system to assess inmates&#x27; appropriate custody and security level placement. The scores range from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest risk or need.
==Standoff==
In early 2004, the Morey Unit of the Lewis complex was the site of the longest standoff between inmates and law enforcement officers in United States history. It was a 15-day ordeal, beginning January 18 and ending February 2. Two officers were taken hostage, one male and one female, by two inmates, Ricky Wassenaar and Steven Coy. In addition, they sexually assaulted the female officer and a kitchen officer. The inmates were originally trying to escape, but their plan went awry, and the escape event turned into a hostage situation. Wassenaar was later convicted of 19 charges relating to the siege and was given 16 life sentences.

<doc id="745990" wikidata="Q371460" url="?curid=745990" title="Arthur MacArthur Sr.">
<text>Arthur MacArthur Sr. (January 26, 1815August 26, 1896) was a Scottish immigrant to America, lawyer, and judge. He was the fourth Governor of Wisconsin and was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. He was the father of General Arthur MacArthur Jr., and paternal grandfather of General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur is the modern spelling used by his descendants, but in documents from his own time his name was spelled McArthur.

==Education and career==

Arthur MacArthur was born on January 26, 1815, in Glasgow, Scotland. His parents were both MacArthurs from the western Scottish Highlands, but his father died before his birth. His mother, Sarah, remarried to Alexander Meggett, and, in 1828, the family migrated to the United States, settling near Uxbridge, Massachusetts.

MacArthur attended Uxbridge and Amherst, but left school to help the family during the depression of 1837. He eventually graduated from Wesleyan University, in Connecticut, in 1840. He studied law in New York, and was admitted to the New York Bar in 1841. He also became interested in politics while in New York, joining the Democratic Party.

While in New York, he met and fell in love with Aurelia Belcher, who convinced him to move to Massachusetts. He entered private practice in Springfield, Massachusetts, and, in 1843, was a public administrator in Hampden County. Around 1844, he married Aurelia, and, with financial assistance from her father, expanded his law practice. He successfully practiced law in New York and Massachusetts for several years, and, in 1849, moved with his wife and son to Milwaukee, in the new state of Wisconsin.

==Wisconsin public offices==

In Wisconsin, MacArthur continued practicing law from 1849 to 1851, and resumed his interest in politics with the Democratic Party in the city. In 1851, he became City Attorney for Milwaukee. In the 1855 election, MacArthur was the Democratic Party nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin, running alongside incumbent Governor William A. Barstow. He defeated Republican Charles Sholes, of Kenosha, to become the 5th Lieutenant Governor of the state.

===1855 election dispute===

The 1855 election, however, also produced a controversy with the apparent re-election of Barstow by a mere 157 votes. Barstow&#x27;s Republican opponent, Wisconsin state senator Coles Bashford, claimed fraud and challenged the results. On January 7, 1856, both Bashford and Barstow were sworn in as Governor of Wisconsin in separate ceremonies.

The outgoing Attorney General, George Baldwin Smith, filed quo warranto proceedings to have Barstow removed, and the case &quot;Atty. Gen. ex rel. Bashford v. Barstow&quot; soon reached the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Barstow initially attempted to challenge the jurisdiction of the court over election results, but eventually relented, and, on March 21, 1856, sent his resignation to the Wisconsin Legislature.

MacArthur, therefore, became the acting Governor of Wisconsin. Four days later, the Wisconsin Supreme Court unanimously decided in favor of Bashford, ruling that the results from several precincts from remote northern counties appeared fraudulent. MacArthur, though he had at first decided to hold the governor&#x27;s office regardless of the court&#x27;s decision, reconsidered and relinquished the governorship to Bashford.

He resumed his duties as Lieutenant Governor, and officially remained in this position until the end of his term, January 1858.

===Wisconsin circuit court===

In 1856, Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Levi Hubbell had resigned his seat on the 2nd Circuit, covering Milwaukee and Waukesha counties. Alexander Randall had been appointed to temporarily fill the seat, but a new election was scheduled for April 1857 to fill the remainder of the term. Randall did not run in the election for a full term; MacArthur, while serving as Lieutenant Governor, ran for and was elected to the position without opposition, taking office the following year. He was re-elected in 1863 and resigned in the fall of 1869.

==Washington, D.C.==

===Federal judicial service===

MacArthur was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on July 15, 1870, to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (now the United States District Court for the District of Columbia), to a new Associate Justice seat authorized by 16 Stat. 160. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 15, 1870, and received his commission the same day. He served on the court for 17 years, and retired on April 1, 1887.

===Later life===

MacArthur remained a prominent member of Washington, D.C., society in his later years. He was a strong supporter of the National University, and served as a trustee, president of the Board of Regents, and Chancellor of the university. He was also President of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Children.

==Family==

Around 1844, MacArthur married Aurelia Belcher (1819–1864), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. They had two sons, Arthur Jr., born in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts, in 1845, and Frank, born in Wisconsin in 1853.

At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Arthur Jr., then sixteen, became passionate about the Union cause. MacArthur appealed directly to President Abraham Lincoln to secure an appointment for Arthur Jr. to the United States Military Academy, but the boy was so eager to join the Union cause, he deferred the academy to volunteer for service. MacArthur assisted his then-seventeen-year-old son in obtaining a commission as an adjutant and first lieutenant in the 24th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, under Colonel Charles H. Larrabee. Arthur Jr. went on to earn the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Civil War, and pursued a career in the Army, eventually rising to the rank of Lieutenant General (three star), and serving as American Governor-General of the Philippines. Arthur Jr. was also the father of American five-star General and World War II hero Douglas MacArthur.

After the death of his wife, Aurelia, MacArthur married Mary E. (Willcut) Hopkins (1824–1899), the widow of Benjamin F. Hopkins.

==Death==

MacArthur died on August 26, 1896, in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

<text>The Battle of Mount Haemus was fought in 338 BC, near the city of Chaeronea in Boeotia, between Macedonia under Philip II and an alliance of city-states led by Athens and Thebes. The battle was the culmination of Philip&#x27;s final campaigns in 339–338 BC and resulted in a decisive victory for the Macedonians and their allies.

Philip had brought peace to a war-torn Greece in 346 BC by ending the Third Sacred War and separately concluding his ten-year conflict with Athens for supremacy in the north Aegean with the Peace of Philocrates. Philip&#x27;s much expanded kingdom, powerful army and plentiful resources now made him the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Greece. To many of the fiercely independent city-states, Philip&#x27;s power after 346 BC was perceived as a threat, especially in Athens, where the politician Demosthenes led efforts to break away from Philip&#x27;s influence. In 340 BC Demosthenes convinced the Athenian assembly to sanction action against Philip&#x27;s territories and to ally with the Achaemenids in Byzantium, which Philip was besieging. These actions were against the terms of their treaty oaths and amounted to a declaration of war. In summer 339 BC, Philip therefore led his army towards South Greece, prompting the formation of an alliance of a few southern Greek states opposed to him, led by Athens and Thebes.

After several months of stalemate, Philip finally advanced into Boeotia in an attempt to march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied army, similar in size and occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line, which then dissolved into a rout.

The battle has been described as one of the most decisive of the ancient world. The forces of Athens and Thebes were destroyed, and continued resistance was impossible; the war therefore came to an abrupt end. Philip was able to impose a settlement upon southern Greece, which all states accepted, with the exception of Sparta. The League of Corinth, formed as a result, made all participants allies of Macedon and each other, with Philip as the guarantor of the peace. In turn, Philip was voted as &quot;strategos&quot; (general) for a pan-Hellenic war against the Achaemenid Empire, which he had long planned. However, before he was able to take charge of the campaign, Philip was assassinated, and the Kingdom of Macedon and responsibility for the war with Persia passed instead to his son Alexander.

==Background==

In the decade following his accession in 359 BC, the Macedonian king, Philip II, had rapidly strengthened and expanded his kingdom into Thrace and Chalkidiki on the northern coast of the Aegean Sea. He was aided in this process by the distraction of Athens and Thebes, the two most powerful city-states in Greece at that point, by events elsewhere. In particular, these events included the Social War between Athens and her erstwhile allies (357–355 BC), and the Third Sacred War which erupted in central Greece in 356 BC between the Phocians and the other members of the Delphic Amphictyonic League. Much of Philip&#x27;s expansion during this period was at the nominal expense of the Athenians, who considered the north Aegean coast as their sphere of influence, and Philip was at war with Athens from 356–346 BC.

Philip was not originally a belligerent in the Sacred War, but became involved at the request of the Thessalians. Seeing an opportunity to expand his influence, Philip obliged, and in 353 or 352 BC won a decisive victory over the Phocians at the Battle of Crocus Field in Thessaly. In the aftermath, Philip was made &quot;archon&quot; of Thessaly, which gave him control of the levies and revenues of the Thessalian Confederation, thereby greatly increasing his power. However, Philip did not intervene further in the Sacred War until 346 BC.

Early in 346 BC, the Thebans, who had borne the brunt of the Sacred War, together with the Thessalians, asked Philip to assume the &quot;leadership of Greece&quot; and join them in fighting the Phocians. Philip&#x27;s power was by now so great that ultimately the Phocians did not even attempt to resist, and instead surrendered to him. Philip was thus able to end a particularly bloody war without any further fighting. Philip allowed the Amphictyonic council the formal responsibility of punishing the Phocians, but ensured that the terms were not overly harsh; nevertheless, the Phocians were expelled from the Amphictyonic League, all their cities were destroyed, and they were resettled in villages of no more than fifty houses.
By 346 BC, the Athenians were war-weary, unable to match Philip&#x27;s strength, and had begun to contemplate the necessity of making peace. Nevertheless, when it became apparent that Philip would march south that year, the Athenians originally planned to help the Phocians (whom they were allied to) keep Philip out of central Greece, by occupying the pass of Thermopylae, where Philip&#x27;s superior numbers would be of little benefit. The Athenians had successfully used this tactic to prevent Philip attacking Phocis itself after his victory at Crocus Field.

The occupation of Thermopylae was not only for the benefit of Phocis; excluding Philip from central Greece also prevented him from marching on Athens itself. However, by the end of February, the general Phalaikos was restored to power in Phocis, and he refused to allow the Athenians access to Thermopylae. Suddenly unable to guarantee their own security, the Athenians were forced instead into making peace with Philip. Their peace treaty, known as the Peace of Philocrates, made Athens a reluctant ally of Macedon.

For the Athenians, the treaty had been expedient, but it was never popular. Philip&#x27;s actions in 346 BC had expanded his influence over all Greece, and although he had brought peace, he had come to be seen as the enemy of the traditional liberty of the city-states. The orator and politician Demosthenes had been a principal architect of the Peace of Philocrates, but almost as soon as it was agreed, he wished to be rid of it. Over the next few years, Demosthenes became leader of the &quot;war-party&quot; in Athens, and at every opportunity he sought to undermine the peace. From 343 BC onwards, in order to try to disrupt the peace, Demosthenes and his followers used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace. 

Conversely, there was at first a substantial body of feeling in Athens, led by Aeschines, that the peace, unpopular though it was, should be maintained and developed. Towards the end of the decade however, the &quot;war party&quot; gained the ascendancy, and began to openly goad Philip; in 341 BC for instance, the Athenian general Diopeithes ravaged the territory of Philip&#x27;s ally Cardia, even though Philip demanded that they desist. Philip&#x27;s patience finally ran out when the Athenians formed an alliance with Byzantium, which Philip was at that time besieging, and he wrote the Athenians declaring war. Shortly afterward Philip broke off the siege of Byzantium; Cawkwell suggests that Philip had decided to deal with Athens once and for all. Philip went on campaign against the Scythians, and then began to prepare for war in southern Greece.

==Prelude==

Philip&#x27;s forthcoming campaign in southern Greece became linked with a new, fourth, Sacred War. The citizens of Amphissa in Ozolian Locris had begun cultivating land sacred to Apollo on the Crisaean Plain south of Delphi; after some internal bickering the Amphictyonic council decided to declare a sacred war against Amphissa. A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip should be made leader of the Amphictyonic effort, which therefore gave Philip a pretext to campaign in southern Greece; it is, however, probable that Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway.

At the start of 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip does not appear to have treated this as a declaration of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route. However, a second route into central Greece was available, leading over the shoulder of Mount Callidromos and descending into Phocis. However, the Athenians and Thebans had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered. 

Philip&#x27;s relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians at the end of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and during the next few months the whole Phocian Confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the Battle of Chaeronea did not occur until August 338 BC. 

During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful.

When news first arrived that Philip was in Elatea, just three days march away, there was panic in Athens. In what Cawkwell describes as his proudest moment, Demosthenes alone counseled against despair, and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans; his decree was passed, and he was sent as ambassador. Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes, requesting that the Thebans join him, or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered. Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip, they could have avoided the conflict altogether. However, in spite of Philip&#x27;s proximity, and their traditional enmity with Athens, they chose to ally with the Athenians, in the cause of liberty for Greece. The Athenian army had already pre-emptively been sent in the direction of Boeotia, and was therefore able to join the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed.

The details of the campaign leading up to Chaeronea are almost completely unknown. Philip was presumably prevented from entering Boeotia by way of Mount Helicon, as the Spartans had done in the run-up to the Battle of Leuctra; or by any of the other mountain passes that led into Boeotia from Phocis. There were certainly some preliminary skirmishes; Demosthenes alludes to a &quot;winter battle&quot; and &quot;battle on the river&quot; in his speeches, but no other details are preserved. Finally, in August 338 BC, Philip&#x27;s army marched straight down the main road from Phocis to Boeotia, to assault the main allied army defending the road at Chaeronea.

==Opposing forces==

According to Diodorus, the Macedonian army numbered roughly 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, a figure generally accepted by modern historians. Philip took command of the right wing of the Macedonian army and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future conqueror of the Persian Empire) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip&#x27;s experienced generals.

The allied army included contingents from Achaea, Corinth, Chalcis, Epidaurus, Megara, and Troezen, with the majority of troops being supplied by Athens and Thebes. The Athenian contingent was led by the generals Chares and Lysicles, and the Thebans by Theagenes. No source provides exact numbers for the allied army, although Justin suggests that the Greeks were &quot;far superior in number of soldiers&quot;. The modern view is that the numbers of the city states that fought were approximately equal to those of the Macedonians. 

The Athenians took up positions on the left wing, the Thebans on the right, and the other allies in the centre. Athenian aristocrat Philippides of Paiania, campaigned for Philip&#x27;s cause with his associates during the battle in Thebes, Eleuthera and Tanagra. Philippides was later prosecuted by Hypereides for his pro-Macedonian actions after the defeat.

==Strategic and tactical considerations==
The allied army of Athens and Thebes had taken up a position near Chaeronea, astride the main road. On the left flank, the allied line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to Lebedea, while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos River, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion. The allied line, which was about 2.5 miles in length, was thus secure on both flanks. Moreover, the allied line seems to have slanted north-eastwards across the plain in between, so that it did not face the direction of Macedonian advance full-square. 

This prevented Philip from attempting to concentrate his force on the allied right wing, since the advanced position of the left wing would then threaten Philip&#x27;s right. Although Philip could attempt to concentrate his force against the southern Greek left, the troops there occupied high ground, and any attack would be difficult. Since the southern Greeks could remain on the defensive, having only to prevent Philip&#x27;s advance, their position was therefore strategically and tactically very strong.

==Battle==

Details of the battle itself are scarce, with Diodorus providing the only formal account. He says that &quot;once joined, the battle was hotly contested for a long time and many fell on both sides, so that for a while the struggle permitted hopes of victory to both.&quot; He then recounts that the young Alexander, &quot;his heart set on showing his father his prowess&quot; succeeded in rupturing the allied line aided by his companions, and eventually put the right wing to flight; meanwhile, Philip advanced in person against the left wing and also put it to flight.

This brief account can be filled out, if Polyaenus&#x27;s account of the battle is to be believed. Polyaenus collected many snippets of information on warfare in his &quot;Strategems&quot;; some are known from other sources to be reliable, while others are demonstrably false. In the absence of other evidence, it is unclear whether his passage regarding Chaeronea is to be accepted or rejected. Polyaenus suggests that Philip engaged the allied left, but then withdrew his troops; the Athenians on the left followed and, when Philip held the high ground, he stopped retreating and attacked the Athenians, eventually routing them. 

In another &#x27;stratagem&#x27;, Polyaenus suggests that Philip deliberately prolonged the battle, to take advantage of the rawness of the Athenian troops (his own veterans being more used to fatigue) and delayed his main attack until the Athenians were exhausted. This latter anecdote also appears in the earlier &quot;Stratagems&quot; of Frontinus.

Polyaenus&#x27;s accounts have led some modern historians to tentatively propose the following synthesis of the battle. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on their right and punched a hole in the allied line. On the allied left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The southern Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander&#x27;s command, then attacked, ending the battle.

Many historians, including Hammond and Cawkwell, place Alexander in charge of the Companion Cavalry during the battle, perhaps because of Diodorus&#x27;s use of the word &quot;companions&quot;. However, there is no mention of cavalry in any ancient account of the battle, nor does there seem to have been space for it to operate against the flank of the southern Greek army. However, some Macedonian cavalry squadrons in wedged formation, a tactical deployment Philip designed for his cavalry for just such a purpose, could have penetrated the gaps which opened amid the Greek lines, gaps which are mentioned by Diodorus in his brief account. Plutarch says that Alexander was the &quot;first to break the ranks of the Sacred Band of the Thebans&quot;, the elite of the Theban infantry, who were stationed on the extreme right of the battle line. This, together with the improbability that a head-on cavalry charge against the spear-armed Thebans could have succeeded, has led Gaebel and others to suggest that Alexander must have been commanding a portion of the Macedonian phalanx at Chaeronea.

Diodorus says that more than 1,000 Athenians died in the battle, with another 2,000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly. Plutarch suggests that all 300 of the Sacred Band were killed at the battle, having previously been seen as invincible. In the Roman period, the &#x27;Lion of Chaeronea&#x27;, an enigmatic monument on the site of the battle, was believed to mark the resting place of the Sacred Band. Modern excavations found the remains of 254 soldiers underneath the monument; it is therefore generally accepted that this was indeed the grave of the Sacred Band, since it is unlikely that every member was killed.

==Aftermath==

Cawkwell suggests that this was one of the most decisive battles in ancient history. Since there was now no army which could prevent Philip&#x27;s advance, the war effectively ended. In Athens and Corinth, records show desperate attempts to re-build the city walls, as they prepared for siege. However, Philip had no intention of besieging any city, nor indeed of conquering it. He wanted the southern Greeks as his allies for his planned campaign against the Persians, and he wanted to leave a stable Greece in his rear when he went on campaign; further fighting was therefore contrary to his aims. Philip marched first to Thebes, which surrendered to him; he expelled the Theban leaders who had opposed him, recalled those pro-Macedonian Thebans who had previously been exiled, and installed a Macedonian garrison. He also ordered that the Boeotian cities of Plataea and Thespiae, which Thebes had destroyed in previous conflicts, be re-founded. Generally, Philip treated the Thebans severely, making them pay for the return of their prisoners, and even to bury their dead; he did not, however, dissolve the Boeotian Confederacy.

By contrast, Philip treated Athens very leniently. Although the Second Athenian League was dissolved, the Athenians were allowed to keep their colony on Samos, and their prisoners were freed without ransom. Philip&#x27;s motives are not entirely clear, but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia, since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians. 

Philip also made peace with the other combatants, Corinth and Chalcis, which controlled important strategic locations both received Macedonian garrisons. He then turned to deal with Sparta, which had not taken part in the conflict, but was likely to take advantage of the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese. The Spartans refused Philip&#x27;s invitation to engage in discussions, so Philip ravaged Lacedaemonia, but did not attack Sparta itself.

Philip seems to have moved around in the months after the battle, making peace with the states that opposed him, dealing with the Spartans, and installing garrisons. His movements also probably served as a demonstration of force to the other cities, that they should not try to oppose him. In mid 337 BC, he seems to have camped near Corinth, and began the work to establish a league of the city-states, which would guarantee peace in Greece, and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia. The result, the League of Corinth, was formed in the latter half of 337 BC at a congress organised by Philip. All states signed up to the league, with the exception of Sparta. 

The principal terms of the concord were that all members became allied to each other, and to Macedon, and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack, freedom of navigation, and freedom from interference in internal affairs. Philip, and the Macedonian garrisons installed, would act as the &#x27;keepers of the peace&#x27;. At Philip&#x27;s behest, the synod of the league then declared war on Persia, and voted Philip as &quot;Strategos&quot; for the forthcoming campaign.

An advance Macedonian force was sent to Persia in early 336 BC, with Philip due to follow later in the year. However, before he could depart, Philip was assassinated by one of his bodyguards. Alexander therefore became King of Macedon, and in a series of campaigns lasting from 334 to 323 BC, he conquered the whole Persian Empire.

<text>The bay-backed shrike (Lanius vittatus) is a member of the bird family Laniidae, the shrikes, resident in South Asia.
==Description==
It is smallish shrike at 17 cm, maroon-brown above with a pale rump and long black tail with white edges. The underparts are white, but with buff flanks. The crown and nape are grey, with a typical shrike black bandit mask through the eye. There is a small white wing patch, and the bill and legs are dark grey.

Sexes are similar, but young birds are washed-out versions of the adults.

==Habits and habitat==
The bay-backed shrike has a characteristic upright &quot;shrike&quot; attitude perched on a bush, from which it sallies after lizards, large insects, small birds and rodents.

Prey may be impaled upon a sharp point, such as a thorn. Thus secured they can be ripped with the strong hooked bill, but its feet are not suited for tearing.

It is a widespread resident or breeder in southern Asia and occurs in Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, India, and Turkmenistan. It is occasionally found in Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Qutar. It nests in bushes in scrubby areas and cultivation, laying 3–5 eggs.

<text>Ned Sparks (born Edward Arthur Sparkman, November 19, 1883 – April 3, 1957) was a Canadian-born character actor of the American stage and screen. He was known for his deadpan expression and comically nasal, monotone delivery.

==Life and career==
Sparks was born in Guelph, Ontario, but moved to St. Thomas, Ontario, where he grew up. He left home at 16 and attempted prospecting in the Klondike Gold Rush. After running out of money, he began performing. Billed as a &quot;Singer of Sweet Southern Songs&quot; and costumed in a straw hat, short pants and bare feet, he won a spot as a singer on a travelling musical company&#x27;s tour. At 19, he returned to Canada and briefly attended a Toronto seminary. He then worked for the railway and in theatre in Toronto. In 1907, he moved to New York City to try his hand in the Broadway theatre, where he appeared in his first show in 1912.

On Broadway, Sparks developed his trademark deadpan expression while portraying a hotel clerk in the play &quot;Little Miss Brown&quot;. His success caught the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio head Louis B. Mayer, who signed him to a six-picture deal. Sparks appeared in numerous silent films before making his &quot;talkie&quot; debut in &quot;The Big Noise&quot; (1928). From 1915 to 1947 he appeared in some 90 pictures.

In the 1930s, Sparks became known for portraying dour-faced, sarcastic, cigar-chomping characters. He became so associated with the type that, in 1936, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Sparks had his face insured for $100,000 with Lloyd&#x27;s of London. Sparks later admitted the story was a publicity stunt and he was insured for only $10,000. In another stunt, the studio offered a reward of $10,000 to anyone who could capture Sparks smiling in a photograph.

Sparks is particularly known for the wry, comic characters he portrayed in iconic pre-Code Hollywood pictures, such as &quot;Blessed Event&quot; (1932), &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1933), &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; (1933), &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; (1933), and &quot;Sing and Like It&quot; (1934).

Sparks was often caricatured in cartoons, including the Jack-in-the-Box character in the Disney short &quot;Broken Toys&quot; (1935), the jester in &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot; (1938), a hermit crab in both Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Fish&quot; (1939) and Bob Clampett&#x27;s Goofy Groceries (1941), a chicken in Bob Clampett&#x27;s &quot;Slap Happy Pappy&quot; (1940), Friz Freleng&#x27;s Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Malibu Beach Party&quot; (1940), and Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Steps Out&quot; (1941). He also voiced the cartoon characters Heckle and Jeckle from 1947 to 1951.

Sparks appeared in ten Broadway productions and over 80 films. He retired from films in 1947, saying that everyone should retire at 65.

Sparks is a relative of Canadian comedian Ron Sparks.

==Death==
Sparks died in Victorville, California, on April 3, 1957, from the effects of an intestinal blockage.

<doc id="746024" wikidata="Q192938" url="?curid=746024" title="Battle of the Granicus">
<text>The Battle of the Granicus in May 334 BC was the first of three major battles fought between Alexander the Great of Macedon and the Persian Achaemenid Empire. The battle took place on the road from Abydus to Dascylium, at the crossing of the Granicus in the Troad region, which is now called the Biga River in Turkey. In the battle Alexander defeated the field army of the Persian satraps of Asia Minor, which defended the river crossing. After this battle, the Persians were forced on the defensive in the cities that remained under their control in the region.

== Background ==
After winning the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, King Philip II of Macedon forced most of the Greek states into a military alliance, the Hellenic League. Its goal was to make war on the Persian Achaemenid Empire to avenge the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC. He managed to convince the other Greek states to elect him as the leader of the League and started preparing for the war.

At the same time the Achaemenid Empire had been in crisis since the murder of its king Artaxerxes III in 338 BC. An important consequence of this was that Egypt again seceded from the empire. At this time there was no large Persian army in Asia Minor and the Persian fleet was not expected in the Aegean Sea soon. Philip most likely wanted to exploit the chaos in the empire, but could not launch a large-scale invasion of Asia Minor because his entire army was not yet ready. For this reason he probably sent a smaller part of his army which could be deployed. In the spring of 336 BC he ordered a Macedonian expeditionary corps of several thousand soldiers to land on the western coast of Asia Minor. The likely mission of this advance-guard was to conquer as much territory as possible, or at the very least establish a bridgehead on the Asian side of the Hellespont to facilitate the crossing of the main army later.

The advance guard was most likely led by Parmenion, Philip&#x27;s best general, with Attalus as second in command. Initially the campaign was a success, with many of the Greek cities of western Asia Minor surrendering peacefully to the Macedonians. At the end of 336 BC this all changed. Philip was murdered, most likely in October 336 BC. Philip was succeeded by his son, Alexander III, who had to put down several revolts in the Balkans and Greece first to reassert Macedonian authority. This distracted him from the operations in Asia Minor. Meanwhile, Darius III had become the new Great King of the Achaemenid Empire, around the autumn of 336 BC. He managed to stabilize the empire and started a counter-offensive against the Macedonian expeditionary force.

Darius prioritized the suppression of the Egyptian revolt, which probably took place from the end of 336 BC to February 335 BC. When this was done he sent Memnon of Rhodes to Asia Minor at the head of a force of Greek mercenaries, who were infantry fighting as hoplites. Memnon defeated a Macedonian force at either Magnesia ad Sipylum or Magnesia on the Maeander, probably in early spring 335 BC. Later that year another Macedonian force was defeated by a Persian army in the Troad, possibly under the command of one or more Persian satraps. By the end of 335 BC most of the Greek cities had been restored to Persian control and the expeditionary force retained only Abydus and perhaps Rhoeteum.

== Prelude ==
Once Alexander had defeated the rebellions in the Balkans and Greece, he marched his army to the Hellespont in early spring 334 BC. His army numbered c. 32,000 infantry and c. 5,000 cavalry. He arrived at Sestus twenty days later, where he split his army for the crossing of the Hellespont. The main part of the army was transported from Sestus to Abydus in Asia Minor, while Alexander crossed with the remainder of the infantry from Elaeus, landing near Cape Sigeum. After visiting Ilium, he passed Arisba, Percote, Lampsacus, Colonae and Hermotus.

Darius would have been informed about Alexander&#x27;s movements for some time, maybe as early as the invasion force had left Macedon. This did not alarm the Great King yet, who left the defense of Asia Minor to his satraps there. The reasons for this may have been that Alexander had not proven himself as a commander abroad yet and that the Macedonian expeditionary force had been pushed back without much difficulty the previous year.

The Persian satraps and commanders were encamped near Zeleia with their army when they were informed of Alexander&#x27;s crossing. The army was led by Arsites, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, Spithridates, satrap of Lydia and Ionia, Arsames, satrap of Cilicia, Rheomithres, Petenes, Niphates and Memnon of Rhodes. While the ancient historians don&#x27;t explicitly identify a commander-in-chief for the Persians, modern historians consider Arsites to have been in overall command because the enemy had invaded his territory.

A council was held by the Persians at Zeleia to discuss the state of affairs. The ancient historians Arrian and Diodorus Siculus claim that Memnon advised the Persians to avoid open battle with the Macedonians. He reasoned that the Macedonian infantry was superior to theirs and that Alexander was present in person, while Darius was not with them. He recommended a scorched earth strategy so that Alexander would not be able to continue his campaign due to lack of supplies. Arsites and the other Persians rejected Memnon&#x27;s advice because they wanted to protect the property of their subjects. They also suspected Memnon of trying to prolong the war so that he could gain favor with Darius.

W. J. McCoy compares Memnon&#x27;s advice with the wise counsel given by Greeks to Persians in the work of Herodotus. In Herodotus, the rejection of such counsel led to misfortune for the Persians and was employed to ridicule them. For this reason he suggests that Memnon&#x27;s advice was an invention by Arrian and Diodorus. Pierre Briant argues that even if the debate took place as described, the relevance of Memnon&#x27;s counsel was overstated because discussing strategy was not the purpose of the meeting. Most likely Darius had already ordered his satraps to engage Alexander&#x27;s army in battle, so the council at Zeleia was held to discuss the tactics of the upcoming battle rather than the strategy of the war. After the council, the Persian army took up position at the eastern bank of the Granicus River and waited for Alexander&#x27;s attack.

According to Arrian, Alexander heard of the location of the Persians from his scouts while he was moving towards the Granicus. He had his army arranged in battle formation. Parmenion was worried that the army could not cross the river with its front extended, and would have to cross over in column with its battle formation disrupted. Because this would make the army vulnerable to Persian attack, he advised Alexander that the army should encamp on the western bank and make an uncontested crossing tomorrow at dawn. Alexander did not want to wait and ordered an immediate attack.

These discussions on strategy and tactics between Parmenion and Alexander are a recurring motif in the writings of ancient historians. In these exchanges Parmenion is depicted as careful, while Alexander is willing to take more risks. Alexander always rejects the advice of Parmenion and is then successful in realizing his own bold plan, which the old general advised him against. This motif may have originated in the work of Callisthenes for the purpose of enhancing the heroism of Alexander. As a consequence, historians have suggested that the discussion may have been fictional.

The battle was fought in the Macedonian month of Daisios, May in the Gregorian calendar. Before the battle, some of the Macedonian officers voiced their reluctance to fight because religious custom required them to avoid battles during this month. Alexander solved this by declaring that the current month should be considered a second Artemision. This month preceded Daisios and did not carry a taboo on warfare.

== Location ==
The Granicus is today called the Biga River (). Traditionally the ford where the battle took place has been located above the confluence of the river which runs through Gümüşçay and the Biga River, or further downstream on the Biga River. More recently N. G. L. Hammond proposed that at the time of the battle the Biga River possibly flowed further east in its valley. In modern times, evidence of an old riverbed can still be seen there. Furthermore, the ancient historians describe a long continuous ridge where the Greek mercenary infantry of the Persians was posted. Because there is only one candidate for this ridge, Hammond has placed the ford between the modern villages Gümüşçay (formerly called Dimetoka) and Çeşmealtı. This theory found support in later scholarship on the battle. The modern observations that the river is not difficult to cross contradicts the ancient historians, who emphasized the hardship of the fording of the river. The ancient historians might have exaggerated to make Alexander&#x27;s accomplishment seem more formidable.

== Opposing forces ==

=== Macedonian army ===
The Macedonian army consisted mostly of infantry. The heavy infantry numbered 12,000 and included the Foot Companions and a smaller group of elite hypaspists. The light infantry totalled 1,000 and contained archers and elite Agrianian javelin-men. The heavy cavalry was made up of 1,800 elite Companion cavalry, 1,800 Thessalian cavalry and 600 Greek allied cavalry. The light cavalry numbered 900 in total and was composed of &quot;prodromoi&quot;, Paeonians and Thracians. Alexander also possessed Greek allied and mercenary infantry, but he had marched to the Granicus without them. In total, Alexander&#x27;s army numbered 12,000 heavy infantry, 1,000 light infantry and 5,100 cavalry for a total of 18,100 men.

From the right wing to the left, Alexander placed seven of his eight squadrons of Companion cavalry, along with the archers and Agrianians, under the command of Philotas. Because the Agrianians usually fought interspersed with the Companion cavalry, they were most likely placed in front of them. The &quot;prodromoi&quot;, the Paeonian cavalry and the eighth squadron of the Companion cavalry under Socrates were posted next to them. Overall command of these three cavalry units was held by Amyntas, son of Arrhabaeus. After them came the hypaspists commanded by Nicanor, which guarded the right flank of the Foot Companions next to them. There were six units of Foot Companions: led by Perdiccas, Coenus, Craterus, Amyntas the son of Andromenes, Philip the son of Amyntas, and Meleager. To the left of Meleager&#x27;s Foot Companions were the Thracian cavalry under the command of Agathon. Next to them were stationed the allied Greek cavalry under Philip, son of Menelaus. At the extreme left were the Thessalian cavalry under the command of Calas. Alexander placed Parmenion in overall command of the Foot Companions of Philip and Meleager, and the cavalry on the left wing. Alexander commanded the remainder of the army on the right wing. The Greek allied and mercenary infantry, which were part of the invasion force, were not used during the battle.

=== Persian army ===
For the Persian army Arrian gives a number of almost 20,000 infantry, all Greek mercenaries, and 20,000 cavalry. Diodorus gives a figure of 10,000 cavalry and 100,000 infantry. Justin gives an even higher number of 600,000 men in total for the Persians. The historian Azar Gat explains that although the Persian Empire and its armies were large, the size of its armies were wildly exaggerated in the Greek sources. Gat adds that this was an &quot;invariable&quot; habit of pre-modern writers, as they both lacked precise information and were patriotically biased.

N. G. L. Hammond accepts the Persian troop numbers given by Arrian. A. M. Devine and Krzysztof Nawotka regard the numbers given by Justin and the number for infantry given by Diodorus to be fantastical because such a large army would have been a logistical impossibility. Both historians consider the figure of 10,000 cavalry given by Diodorus to be more plausible. J. F. C. Fuller also considers a number of 10,000 cavalry to be more likely, but he does not mention the figure of Diodorus. Arrian&#x27;s claim on the strength and composition of the Persian infantry has elicited more detailed discussion. There have been arguments that the figure of 20,000 is accurate, but also included non-Greek native infantry. Others have argued that Greek mercenaries may have been the only infantry present but were not as numerous.

Krzysztof Nawotka considers Arrian&#x27;s claim of 20,000 infantry credible, but does not think it consisted entirely of Greek mercenaries. Such a large force of mercenaries would have been raised only very occasionally, after a long period of preparation and under the command of the Great King. Because the Achaemenids had not made such preparations for the battle, he judges that only a small fraction of the infantry were Greek mercenaries. Accordingly, local detachments of little military value made up the vast majority of the infantry. Based on Plutarch&#x27;s statement that the infantry of both sides engaged after the Macedonian phalanx crossed the river, Ernst Badian likewise believes that non-Greek infantry was part of the Persian army and posted directly behind the cavalry. In this light, he considers 20,000 a reasonable estimate for the total number of infantry. He believes that Arrian&#x27;s claim that all Persian infantry consisted of Greek mercenaries was either a mistake or an attempt to enhance Alexander&#x27;s glory.

A.M. Devine argues that Arrian likely exaggerated the number of Greek mercenaries for propaganda purposes. He notes that the only other information on Greek mercenaries in Asia Minor at that time is given by Diodorus and Polyaenus. Diodorus writes that Memnon&#x27;s force of Greek mercenaries, which Darius III had sent to Asia Minor to fight the Macedonian expeditionary force, numbered 5,000 men. Polyaenus gives a lower number for these, 4,000. Assuming that Arrian was right in his claim that the infantry consisted exclusively of Greek mercenaries and that the figure of 10,000 cavalry given by Diodorus is plausible, he suggests that the Persian army likely numbered 14,000 to 15,000 men. This was significantly inferior both in numbers and quality compared to the 18,100 men fielded by Alexander. Like A. M. Devine, J. F. C. Fuller thinks the number of 5,000 mercenaries given by Diodorus is more realistic, but he thinks there must have also been a considerable force of local levies.

A.M. Devine goes on to argue that this inferiority of the Persian force would explain why the Persians chose to defend a river crossing and place their cavalry in the front line. It would also explain why Alexander decided to risk a frontal attack there. Likewise, the encirclement and massacre of the Greek mercenaries later during the battle would have been unlikely if they had actually numbered 20,000 instead of 4,000 or 5,000. Finally, the low estimate for the size of the Persian army would fit with the small number of casualties for the Macedonians.

The Persians stationed their cavalry along the bank of the Granicus. The left wing was held by Memnon and Arsames, each with their own cavalry units. Next to them Arsites commanded the Paphlagonian horsemen. Spithridates was placed next to him and led the Hyrcanian cavalry. The center was held by cavalry of unspecified ethnicity. The right wing consisted of 1,000 Median cavalry, 2,000 cavalry headed by Rheomithres and another unit of 2,000 Bactrian horse. The Persians moved some of their cavalry to reinforce their left wing when they noticed Alexander himself was stationed opposite this wing. The Greek mercenaries were placed behind the cavalry and led by the Persian Omares.

Historians have criticized several decisions made by the Persian commanders. One of these is the deployment of the cavalry on the river&#x27;s bank, because it did not allow the cavalry to charge. This has been explained by the fact that the Persian cavalry at that time did not use charge tactics yet. Instead, they would approach enemy formations and attack them with javelins to disrupt them from a distance. Once the formation was sufficiently disordered, the cavalry would switch to curved swords for the melee fighting. Likewise, historians have questioned why Memnon was given command of a cavalry unit at the front line, given his success with leading the Greek mercenaries. A possible motive is that the Persian commanders were jealous of him and did not trust him. Memnon would have been easier for them to control in their midst at the front line. A third point of criticism is the deployment of their infantry far from the frontline. Modern historians have suggested that the Persian commanders did so out of resentment towards the Greek mercenaries, which had defeated the Macedonians at Magnesia the year prior. By defeating Alexander with just their cavalry, they would have regained their pride.

== Battle ==

There are three different accounts of the battle given by the ancient historians Arrian, Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus. Arrian&#x27;s account is the longest and most detailed, Plutarch&#x27;s account is shorter but corresponds with Arrian&#x27;s narrative except for some small differences. The account of Diodorus Siculus however is fundamentally different from that of Arrian and Plutarch.

=== Account of Arrian ===
After both armies finished their deployment, there was a moment of silence. Alexander then ordered Amyntas, son of Arrhabeus, to attack the Persian left wing with the Companion cavalry squadron of Socrates (now led by Ptolemy, son of Philip) at the front, followed by the Paeonian cavalry, the &quot;prodromoi&quot; and an unspecified infantry unit. Arrian then gives the impression that Alexander advanced at nearly the same time with the remainder of the right wing and the infantry, but later makes it clear that Alexander&#x27;s attack came after the troops of Amyntas were pushed back. Arrian&#x27;s source may have done so to make Alexander look more heroic.

The Persians answered the charge of the vanguard with volleys of javelins. Amyntas&#x27;s force was at a disadvantage because they were severely outnumbered and the Persians were defending higher ground at the top of the bank. The Macedonians suffered losses and retreated towards Alexander, who now attacked with the remaining Companion cavalry of the right wing.

A. M. Devine reasons that the failure of the attack led by Amyntas was not a mistake, but a ruse to draw the Persian cavalry out of formation as they pursued the retreating force of Amyntas into the riverbed. The disruption of the Persian formation would have made them vulnerable to the second attack led by Alexander in person. There have been different translations and interpretations of Arrian&#x27;s description of how Alexander executed the attack with his cavalry.

Some historians have taken Arrian&#x27;s description as an attack on the Persian center. J. F. C. Fuller thinks Alexander led his attack in a movement diagonally to the left to attack the left of the Persian center. Similarly, A. B. Bosworth considers this movement to have been directed downstream to the left towards the Persian center. The Macedonian forces would have moved in a diagonal line and eventually formed up in wedge formation as they ascended the eastern bank of the Granicus.

Other historians maintain that Alexander attacked the Persian left wing. Ernst Badian thinks that Arrian makes it clear that the Persians had massed their cavalry at the left flank and that Alexander attacked that same mass of cavalry. This would have meant that Alexander must have moved more or less straight ahead. Presumably he would have entered the riverbed at a narrow point, so that his cavalry was in column and vulnerable to attack on their flanks as they ascended the riverbank on the Persian side at a wider point. To prevent this, Alexander would have sent his men towards the left, in the direction of the current, while still in the riverbed. This would have widened the front of his formation so that it would match the Persian formation as they emerged on the other bank. N. G. L. Hammond thinks it was a sideways movement upstream to the right so that the troops would remain in line as they crossed the Granicus. The purpose of this would have been to avoid crossing in disorder and in column, while giving Alexander&#x27;s cavalry mostly the same formation as the Persian cavalry. A. M. Devine argues that it was not merely an oblique movement, but also an oblique formation.
Continuing Arrian&#x27;s narrative, Alexander and his men engaged the Persians and their leaders in a hard-fought battle. The Macedonians eventually got the upper hand because their lance (the xyston) was more effective in melee than the javelin used by the Persians. During the battle, Alexander himself broke his lance and asked his servant Aretis for another. As Aretis had also broken his during the fighting, Demaratus of Corinth handed his lance to Alexander. Alexander then saw Mithridates, the son-in-law of Darius, leading a cavalry unit. Alexander charged and killed him with a lance thrust to his face. Another Persian noble, Rhosaces, then hit Alexander on the helmet with a sword, but the helmet protected him. Alexander dispatched Rhosaces by thrusting him in the chest with his lance. Sphithridates was about to attack Alexander from behind with his sword, but his sword arm was cut off by Cleitus the Black. The other Macedonian cavalry had by then established a foothold on the river bank and reinforced Alexander&#x27;s force.

At this point in the battle the Macedonian cavalry and the light infantry which was interspersed with them forced back the Persian cavalry. This began on the Persian left flank where Alexander was fighting. Then the center was broken and the Persian cavalry on both wings fled. Alexander did not pursue them far but turned his attention to the Greek mercenaries, who had mostly remained inactive at their original position. The mercenaries were surprised by the turn of events and were attacked by both the Foot Companions from the front and the cavalry from all other directions. They were soon defeated and only a few were able to escape.

=== Account of Plutarch ===

Plutarch&#x27;s account focuses more on the &quot;aristeia&quot; of Alexander&#x27;s personal combat with the Persian leaders and gives less attention to the movements and tactics of the armies. This account mostly corresponds to Arrian&#x27;s version of events, but there are some differences. According to Plutarch the Persians had stationed both infantry and cavalry at their front line. Alexander lead the first attack against the Persians and there are minor differences in his combat with Rhosaces and Sphithridates. While the cavalry battle was ongoing, the Foot Companions crossed the river and engaged the Persian infantry. After a short confrontation, all except for the Greek mercenaries routed. The mercenaries retreated to a higher position. They asked Alexander to negotiate for their surrender, but Alexander refused this and attacked. The mercenaries fought hard and were responsible for most of the Macedonian casualties.

=== Account of Diodorus ===
In the account given by Diodorus, the Macedonian and Persian armies encamped on the opposite banks of the Granicus and did not move for the rest of the day. Alexander then crossed the Granicus unopposed at dawn on the next day. Both armies then formed up and started the battle with their cavalry. Diodorus then describes the personal combat of Alexander with the Persian nobles, which differs slightly from the account of Arrian and Plutarch. When many of the Persian commanders were slain and the Persian cavalry was pushed back everywhere, the Persian cavalry opposite Alexander was routed. The rest of the Persian cavalry joined them in flight. After this, the infantry engaged each other, which soon ended with the rout of the Persian infantry.

=== Modern interpretations ===
Historian Peter Green, in his 1974 book &quot;Alexander of Macedon&quot;, proposed a way to reconcile the accounts of Diodorus and Arrian. According to Green&#x27;s interpretation, the riverbank was guarded by infantry, not cavalry, and Alexander&#x27;s forces sustained heavy losses in the initial attempt to cross the river and were forced to retire. Alexander then grudgingly accepted Parmenion&#x27;s advice and crossed the river during the night in an uncontested location, and fought the battle at dawn the next day. The Persian army hurried to the location of Alexander&#x27;s crossing, with the cavalry reaching the scene of the battle first before the slower infantry, and then the battle continued largely as described by Arrian and Plutarch. Green accounts for the differences between his account and the ancient sources by suggesting that Alexander later covered up his initial failed crossing. Green devoted an entire appendix in support of his interpretation, taking the view that for political reasons, Alexander could not admit even a temporary defeat. Thus, the initial defeat was covered up by his propagandists by a very heroic (and Homeric) charge into the now well-deployed enemy. In his preface to the 2013 reprint, Green conceded that he no longer believed his theory was convincing and that the contradiction could not be explained.

Other historians have dismissed the account of Diodorus as incorrect and favor Arrian&#x27;s and Plutarch&#x27;s narratives. The description given by Diodorus of a separate cavalry and infantry battle would have been uncharacteristic for the Macedonians, who always coordinated their infantry and cavalry to work together. It is likely that a crossing of the Granicus at night or at dawn would have been detected and opposed by the Persians. Even if an uncontested crossing elsewhere was possible, it might have induced the Persian army to retreat. In that case Alexander would have lost the opportunity to quickly destroy the only Persian army present in Asia Minor at that time. An attack in the afternoon would also have meant that the Persians would have to fight with the sun in their eyes, whereas the Macedonians would have the sun in their eyes if they had attacked at dawn.

== Casualties ==

=== Macedonian army ===
For the Macedonians, Arrian gives losses of 25 Companion cavalry in the preliminary attack, 60 from the rest of the cavalry and 30 of the infantry, a total of 115 killed. Plutarch gives 34 dead, of which 25 were cavalry and 9 were infantry. Justin mentions 9 infantry and 120 cavalry killed.

A. M. Devine observes that the source used by Arrian for the casualties was Ptolemy I, who in turn used Callisthenes as a source for the casualties. Plutarch used Aristobulus as his source. This suggests that Plutarch misunderstood the information, because his 25 dead cavalry are probably the 25 Companions who fell during the preliminary attack. Justin&#x27;s figures seem to be a confused conflation of both Ptolemy I and Aristobulus. Because the battle was short, A. M. Devine considers Arrian&#x27;s numbers to be reasonably accurate.

=== Persian army ===
Next to the Persian nobles who fell in personal combat with Alexander, many Persian leaders perished in the battle. Arrian mentions Niphates, Petenes, Mithrobuzanes, the satrap of Cappadocia, Arbupales, the son of the Darius who was the son of Artaxerxes II, Pharnaces, brother of the wife of Darius, and Omares. Arsites survived and fled into Phrygia, but committed suicide later because he was blamed for the defeat. Diodorus also mentions Atizyes, the satrap of Greater Phrygia as being killed, but also mentions him later as a casualty of the Battle of Issus.

For the Persians, Arrian states that 1,000 cavalry were killed and 2,000 Greek mercenaries were taken prisoner. Plutarch mentions 2,500 cavalry and 20,000 infantry killed. Diodorus gives statistics of 2,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry killed, as well as 20,000 men who were taken prisoner. 

The casualty figures of Plutarch and Diodorus are judged to be impossibly large by A. M. Devine. He considers Arrian&#x27;s figures of 1,000 cavalry killed and 2,000 captured Greek mercenaries to be reasonably accurate. He takes Arrian&#x27;s number on the captured mercenaries to imply that the remaining 18,000 were killed, which he dismisses. Based on his theory that there were no more than 4,000 to 5,000 Greek mercenaries, it could possibly mean that 2,000 to 3,000 of them were massacred. This gives a total Persian loss of 5,000 to 6,000.

== Aftermath ==
The 2,000 Greek mercenaries who were captured were sent to Macedon to work the land as slaves. Even though they were Greeks, Alexander felt they had betrayed their fellow Greeks with their service to the Persians. In doing so, they did not abide by the agreement made at the Hellenic League, which compelled the Greeks to fight Persia and not each other. He also sent 300 suits of Persian armour to Athens as a votive offering to Athena on the Acropolis. He ordered an inscription to be fixed over them so as to mark the absence of the Spartans in his united Greek army: &quot;Alexander, son of Philip and all the Greeks except the Lacedaemonians, present this offering from the spoils taken from the barbarians inhabiting Asia&quot;. A statue group, known as the Granicus Monument, was erected by Alexander in the sanctuary of Zeus at Dion. This consisted of bronze statues by Lysippus of Alexander with twenty-five of his companions who had died in the initial cavalry charge, all on horseback. In 146 BC, after the Fourth Macedonian War, this statue group was taken to Rome by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, where they were displayed in a portico that he built below the Capitoline Hill.

Dascylium was evacuated by its Persian garrison and occupied by Parmenion. Alexander marched to Sardis, which surrendered to him. He continued to Ephesus, which was also evacuated by its garrison of Greek mercenaries. When Magnesia and Tralles also offered their surrender, he sent Parmenion to those cities. He sent Lysimachus to the cities in Aeolis and Ionia which were still under Persian control, ordering him to break up the oligarchies there and reinstate democratic government. When Alexander arrived at Miletus the city resisted him, so he besieged it.

The Persian military losses were not disastrous, as a large portion of the army managed to retreat to Halicarnassus. On the other hand, the strategic outcome was precarious for the Achaemenid Empire. Achaemenid satraps had been defeated in Asia Minor before and Sardis had been besieged, but this was the first time that the citadel of Sardis had fallen and that an enemy force could continue its march without significant obstacles until Halicarnassus.

<doc id="746036" wikidata="Q1429804" url="?curid=746036" title="Battle of Crannon">
<text>The Battle of Crannon (322 BC), fought between the Macedonian forces of Antipater and Craterus and the forces of a coalition of cities including Athens and the Aetolian League, was the decisive battle of the Lamian War. The Macedonian victory, though militarily unspectacular, convinced the other Greeks to sue for peace.

==Prelude==

The Athenians, upon learning of the death of Alexander the Great in June 323 BC, decided to turn against Macedonian hegemony in the rest of Greece. Recruiting a force of mercenaries and joined by many other city-states, the Athenians were at first able to bring superior numbers against the enemy as Antipater, the Macedonian viceroy in Europe, was lacking sufficient troops due to the Macedonian campaigns in the east. Forced to take refuge in Lamia, Antipater called for reinforcements from Asia. The first to respond, Leonnatus, led his forces against the Athenian cavalry but was killed in the subsequent battle. Though the Athenians defeated Leonnatus and his reinforcements at Rhamnus, Antipater was able to leave from Lamia with his and Leonnatus&#x27; remaining forces. The arrival of a third Macedonian force under the leadership of Craterus decidedly shifted the numerical superiority to the Macedonian side.

==Battle==

Antipater and Craterus now marched their combined army south to force the Athenians and their allies into battle. The Athenians, after calling together their dispersed forces, met the Macedonians near Crannon in Thessaly.

Relying on the high reputation of the Thessalian horse, the Athenian general Antiphilus decided to try to win the battle using cavalry, as in the prior battle with Leonnatus. The battle therefore opened with the clash between the Athenian-led and Macedonian cavalry. With the cavalry of both sides occupied, Antipater ordered his infantry to charge the enemy line. The Athenian infantry was driven back by the more numerous Macedonians and withdrew to the high ground from where they could easily repulse any Macedonian assault. Seeing their infantry in retreat, the Athenian cavalry disengaged from the battle, leaving the field and handing victory to the Macedonians.

==Aftermath==

While the Athenian led army was still intact, it was clear that the Macedonians had gained the advantage in the war. After conferring with his cavalry commander, Menon of Pharsalus, Antiphilus therefore sent an embassy to Antipater the next day asking for terms. Antipater refused to conclude any general peace with the Athenian led alliance as a whole, insisting instead that each city send its own ambassadors. While these terms were at first rejected, the subsequent Macedonian capture of several Thessalian cities caused a rush of defections as each city strove to make a separate peace.

Athens, abandoned by her allies, was at last forced to surrender unconditionally. In the peace imposed by Antipater, the Athenians were forced to accept a Macedonian garrison as well as a replacement of democracy with an oligarchy under the leadership of Phocion.

<doc id="746039" wikidata="Q7892378" url="?curid=746039" title="United States congressional delegations from Arkansas">
<text>Since Arkansas became a U.S. state in 1836, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives, beginning with the 25th United States Congress in 1837, with the exception of the Civil War period between the 37th United States Congress in 1861 and the 40th United States Congress in 1868, when Arkansas&#x27; congressional delegations were sent to the Confederate States Congress instead. Before becoming a state, the Arkansas Territory elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress, beginning with the 16th United States Congress in 1819. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years in general elections, with their re-election staggered. Prior to the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were elected by the Arkansas General Assembly. Each state elects a varying number of, but at least one, member of the House, depending on population, to two-year terms. Arkansas has sent four members to the House in each congressional delegation since the 1960 United States census.

== Current delegation ==

Arkansas&#x27;s current congressional delegation in the consists of its two senators, and four representatives, all of whom are Republicans.

The current dean of the Arkansas delegation is Senator John Boozman, having served in the Senate since 2011 and in the U.S. Congress since 2001.
== United States Senate ==
35 people have served as a U.S. senator from Arkansas, consisting of 33 men and two women, as well as 28 Democrats and 7 Republicans. Two, William K. Sebastian and Charles B. Mitchel, were expelled from the Senate because of Arkansas&#x27; secession from the Union at the start of the American Civil War; Sebastian was the only senator from a Confederate state to later be reinstated, albeit posthumously. After her husband&#x27;s death in office, Hattie Caraway, became the first to be elected to a full term in the Senate after finishing his term. The longest-serving senator from Arkansas, John L. McClellan, chaired many Senate committees during his 34 years in office, including the Senate Committee on Government Operations and the Senate Appropriations Committee. For some time, he served with J. William Fulbright, known for the Fulbright Program, establishing an American student exchange program; his chairing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, resulting in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and Fulbright hearings; and his opposition to the civil rights movement. Other senators from Arkansas also served in leadership roles in the Senate, including Joseph T. Robinson, who served as Senate Majority Leader, and Ambrose Sevier and James P. Clarke, who both served as president pro tempore of the Senate.

Senators are elected every six years depending on their class, with each senator serving a six-year term and elections for senators occurring every two years; the class up for re-election rotates such that each election, around one-third of the seats in the Senate are up for election. Arkansas&#x27; senators are elected in classes II and III. Currently, Arkansas is represented in the Senate by Tom Cotton and John Boozman.

<doc id="746043" wikidata="Q883233" url="?curid=746043" title="William A. Barstow">
<text>William Augustus Barstow (September 13, 1813December 13, 1865) was an American businessman, politician, and Wisconsin pioneer. He was Wisconsin&#x27;s third governor (1854–1856) and second Secretary of State (1850–1852). Barstow&#x27;s administration was infamous in its era for corruption involving the railroad industry. For decades after, Barstow&#x27;s name became synonymous with the epithets &quot;Barstow and the 40 thieves&quot; and &quot;Barstow and the balance&quot;, phrases that referred to the participants in a scheme in which Barstow and dozens of lawmakers of both parties received bribes from the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad to influence land grants. Barstow also attempted to steal the 1855 Wisconsin gubernatorial election, and then illegitimately occupied the office of governor for the first three months of 1856 until compelled to resign. Despite the ubiquity of the charges against him and a lengthy investigation by the Wisconsin Legislature, Barstow never faced criminal liability over these events.

Before Wisconsin became a state, Barstow had been instrumental in the creation of Waukesha County, from the western half of what had been a larger Milwaukee County. After his gubernatorial term, during the American Civil War, Barstow volunteered for service as a Union Army cavalry officer and rose to the rank of brigadier general, serving mostly in the trans-Mississippi theater of the war. He struggled with disease during nearly his entire service in the war, and died just a few months after the war&#x27;s conclusion.

==Early life==
Barstow was born in Plainfield, Connecticut, and was raised there, working on his family&#x27;s farm and attending local schools. At age 16, he moved to Norwich, Connecticut, and worked as a clerk in a store owned by his brother, Samuel. They later moved their business to Cleveland, Ohio. After the Panic of 1837, the Barstows moved to the Wisconsin Territory, settling in Waukesha in 1839. At the time, Waukesha was part of Milwaukee County and was known as &quot;Prairie Village&quot; and later &quot;Prairieville.&quot;

==Wisconsin Territory==

The Barstows built a flour mill and became prominent businessmen in the new settlement. William was elected postmaster in the village in 1842, and Samuel was elected to the Territorial Legislature in 1845. William ran for sheriff of Milwaukee County in 1843 on the Democratic Party ticket, but was defeated by independent candidate Edward D. Holton. In that election, Barstow was hurt by Democratic voter defections due to allegations he had packed the convention with supporters to secure his nomination.

===Waukesha separation===
During this time, agitation began in Prairieville and other Waukesha towns for the creation of a separate county from Milwaukee. There were several reasons for this, but the principal cause was probably the desire for Waukesha residents to keep more of their tax money for local improvements, rather than funding the growth of Milwaukee, which was how they perceived their role under the Milwaukee County organization. The Barstows became some of the leaders of the separation movement, along with Alexander Randall, with whom they were politically allied throughout these years. Samuel, now serving in the Territorial Legislature, sponsored a bill in the Legislature which put the question of separation to a referendum in the proposed county. The referendum was bitterly contested, but ultimately passed amid allegations of fraud on both sides. The town of Prairieville was renamed &quot;Waukesha&quot; in 1847 and became the seat of the new county.

==Political career==
===Secretary of State===
At the Wisconsin Democratic Convention in September 1849, Barstow was nominated for Secretary of State of Wisconsin on the 5th ballot, defeating incumbent Thomas McHugh and other challengers, including Myron B. Williams and Frederick W. Horn. He went on to win the November general election, defeating Whig candidate Levi Alden and Free Soil candidate Edward D. Holton, and became Wisconsin&#x27;s 2nd Secretary of State.

As Secretary of State, Barstow&#x27;s term was consumed by scandals connected to corruption of federal land grants and state government contracts associated with printing, the state insane asylum, and the state treasury. In particular, he was implicated by a statement from a Madison &quot;Argus&quot; editor who stated his determination to win a State printing contract even if he had to &quot;buy up Barstow and the balance.&quot; The phrase stuck with Barstow for the rest of his career.

He fought a bitter campaign in the Democratic caucuses attempting to earn renomination, but, at the State Convention in 1851, he was defeated on the third ballot by Charles D. Robinson, of Brown County.

===Wisconsin Governor===
In 1852, Barstow&#x27;s reputation had sufficiently recovered to represent Wisconsin at the 1852 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore. But his legal controversies continued, and, during the 1853 legislative session, Barstow&#x27;s name was associated with several corrupt acts charged in the impeachment of Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Levi Hubbell, and gave a deposition to the Legislature under subpoena. Hubbell was acquitted, however, and no new charges were brought against Barstow.

The same legislative session, however, also passed a temperance law based on the Maine Liquor Law, creating a statewide referendum on the question. Barstow became a vocal opponent of the act, speaking against it around the state. Through the summer of 1853 he was a nominal supporter of A. Hyatt Smith to receive the Democratic nomination for Governor and participated in several party meetings and caucuses in which delegates were selected. At the state convention however, as Smith was unable to reach a majority after 7 ballots, he dropped out of the race and encouraged his delegates to support Barstow. Barstow was nominated on the 11th ballot, narrowly defeating Jairus C. Fairchild. The convention also adopted a resolution calling for the defeat of the temperance law.

In the November 1853 general election, Barstow faced off against Free Soil candidate Edward D. Holton for the third time, defeating him again and earning 54% of the statewide vote. Governor Barstow was sworn in on January 2, 1854. As governor, Barstow supported the railroad to the Pacific and stood against the attempts of the Know-Nothing movement to undermine the citizenship of the foreign-born or slow down immigration. As promised, he opposed and vetoed the temperance law, despite the fact that the referendum had demonstrated popular support for the measure.

However, allegations of financial impropriety emerged again, this time related to the use of public school funds and improper influence on state-backed loans and other expenses appropriated by his allies in the Democrat-dominated 1854 Legislature. Although he was able to secure renomination by the Democrats in 1853, Barstow lost support within his party as well as in Wisconsin generally.

===Disputed election===

When Barstow ran for reelection in 1855, he was initially declared the winner over his Republican opponent, Coles Bashford, by a mere 157 votes. However, Bashford claimed the result was fraudulent, and it was soon substantiated that Barstow&#x27;s win was due to forged election returns from nonexistent precincts in the sparsely populated northern part of the state, in addition to other irregularities such as two separate canvassing boards claiming legitimacy in Waupaca County and attempting to submit conflicting certifications.

As rival militia units converged on the state capital in Madison, threatening to start a civil war within the state, Barstow was inaugurated in a full, public ceremony on January 7, 1856. On the same day, Bashford was also sworn in quietly as governor in the chambers of the Wisconsin Supreme Court by Chief Justice Edward V. Whiton.

The Wisconsin Attorney General, George Baldwin Smith, filed quo warranto proceedings in the Wisconsin Supreme Court to remove Barstow, who threatened that he would not &quot;give up his office alive.&quot; After challenging the court&#x27;s jurisdiction without success and noting that the tide of public opinion had turned against him, Barstow declined to contest the fraud allegations and sent his resignation to the legislature on March 21, 1856, leaving the lieutenant governor, Arthur MacArthur, as acting governor. On March 24, the court unanimously awarded the governorship to Bashford by a count of 1,009 votes in the case &quot;Atty. Gen. ex rel. Bashford v. Barstow&quot;.

==Later life==
Barstow moved to Janesville, Wisconsin, where he opened a bank and promoted various railroad construction schemes, becoming president of the St. Croix and Lake Superior Railroad. His business ventures were mostly unsuccessful as his bank failed in the Panic of 1857, and his railroad company was consumed in another bribery scandal. He remained involved in Democratic politics, however, and served as a Wisconsin delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1860, where he worked for the nomination and election of Stephen A. Douglas.

==Civil War service==
After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Barstow wrote to General John C. Frémont, who had been named commander of the Department of the West, and offered to raise a regiment of cavalry. In the intervening months, the United States Department of War reduced their request for additional volunteer cavalry regiments and revoked the authorization for Barstow&#x27;s regiment, but, after appeals from Barstow and Governor Alexander Randall, demonstrating that the regiment was nearly complete, the War Department restored his authority. The 3rd Wisconsin Cavalry Regiment mustered into the service of the Union Army under Colonel William Barstow on January 31, 1862, at Camp Barstow, near Janesville, and left the state on March 26, proceeding to St. Louis.

Shortly after their arrival at St. Louis, Colonel Barstow was named Provost Marshal of Kansas and the regiment was distributed around the state on provost duty. For most of his term in this role, Colonel Barstow operated out of Fort Leavenworth. Just months after starting his service, Colonel Barstow was struck by illness and, after struggling for several months, he accepted reassignment in the summer of 1863 to preside over courts-martial at Missouri. He was mustered out of the service on March 4, 1865, and received a retroactive promotion to brigadier general of volunteers on March 13, 1865.

==Death==
He returned to Leavenworth, Kansas, after leaving federal service and bid for a contract on the state prison. Two of his sons also relocated to the city. His health had continued to decline through his years in the war, suffering from chronic diarrhea. He died at Leavenworth on December 13, 1865.

==Family and legacy==
William A. Barstow was married to Maria Quarles of Kenosha, Wisconsin. They had four sons.

Barstow was the son of William Augusta Barstow and Sally Hall Barstow. His Uncles John and Ebenezer Barstow were volunteers in the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. Ebenezer Barstow&#x27;s grandson, John L. Barstow, was the 39th Governor of Vermont.

Barstow Street in downtown Waukesha, Wisconsin, is named for him.

<doc id="746054" wikidata="Q1756672" url="?curid=746054" title="Santa Ana Mountains">
<text>The Santa Ana Mountains are a short peninsular mountain range along the coast of Southern California in the United States. They extend for approximately southeast of the Los Angeles Basin largely along the border between Orange and Riverside counties.

== Geography and climate ==
===Peaks and boundaries===
The range starts in the north at the Whittier Fault and Santa Ana Canyon, through which the Santa Ana River flows. To the north of the canyon are the smaller Chino Hills in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. The northernmost summit of the Santa Anas, at , is Sierra Peak. From there, the major summits are Pleasants Peak, ; Bedford Peak, ; and Bald Peak, . The next two peaks — Modjeska, ; and Santiago, , the highest summit in the range — form Saddleback Ridge. Saddleback, located approximately 20 mi (32 km) east of Santa Ana, is visible from much of Southern California.
South of Saddleback are Trabuco Peak, ; Los Pinos Peak, and Sitton Peak, . Elsinore Peak, is included in a subrange called the Elsinore Mountains, which are west of Lake Elsinore. San Mateo Peak marks the highpoint of this range. Margarita Peak, ; and Redonda Mesa, are part of the Santa Margarita Mountains, a subrange of the Santa Anas that extends down to Camp Pendleton and Fallbrook. Southeast of the Elsinore Mountains is the Santa Rosa Plateau, named for the Rancho Santa Rosa that once encompassed it. At the south end of the plateau there is a steep escarpment from the basalt capped mesas that line it, that descends from about 500 feet at Mesa de Burro to Sandia Creek on the east to about 1800 feet at Avenaloca Mesa to De Luz Creek in the west. From the foot of the escarpment, the mountains and canyons of De Luz, Sandia Creek and others below it, run to the south to the Santa Margarita River. The range ends roughly at the Santa Margarita River.

Much of the range is within the Trabuco Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest, although some parts are still owned by two century-old ranches: the Irvine Ranch (originally known as the Yorba Family&#x27;s Rancho Lomas de Santiago) and Rancho Mission Viejo (originally recorded as Rancho &quot;Misión Vieja&quot;).

===Waterways===
The Santa Anas include a number of high-mountain streams that flow for all or most of the year, although once out of the foothills these waterways are ephemeral. The major streams rising from the western side of the range drain into the Pacific Ocean; these include Peters Canyon Wash, Serrano Creek, San Diego Creek, Aliso Creek, Trabuco Creek, San Juan Creek, and San Mateo Creek. The northern side of the range is defined by the Santa Ana River, which heads about further east, in the San Bernardino Mountains. Santiago Creek drains much of the northern part of the range and empties into the Santa Ana River near downtown Orange.

Water from the north-east side of the range empties into Temescal Creek which flows north to the Santa Ana River, or Lake Elsinore which intermittently overflows to Temescal Creek. The southeast end of the range is marked by the Santa Margarita River, which also originates east of the Santa Anas and flows southwest to the Pacific. Runoff from the southeast side of the range drains into Murrieta Creek, a tributary of the Santa Margarita River.

Irvine Lake, the largest body of fresh water in Orange County, is in the northwest part of the range near Villa Park. The lake is formed by the Santiago Dam, which impounds Santiago Creek.

===Climate===
The climate is Mediterranean, with warm dry summers and cool wet winters. Annual precipitation totals range from 20 to 30 inches (500–760 mm) in the higher parts of the range above 3,000 feet (910m), as compared to the average of 13–16 inches (350–400 mm) in the coastal plain. Most of the precipitation falls between November and March. The western (coastal) slope is generally moister than the eastern slope. Snow falls during winter on the highest peaks.

== Human history ==
The mountains were named by members of Gaspar de Portolà&#x27;s expedition, who camped below the mountains on July 26, 1769, the Feast Day of Saint Anne. At the time of Portola&#x27;s visit, the Santa Anas were settled by three main groups of indigenous peoples, the Tongva in the north, the Acjachemen in the west and Payomkowishum in the east and south.
A handful of historic sites remain in the range today. Registered California Historical Landmarks include an Indian Village Site in Black Star Canyon, Flores Peak named for the outlaw Juan Flores, the mining boomtown sites of Carbondale and Silverado, and Helena Modjeska&#x27;s home. The Moreno and Machado Adobes of the Rancho Santa Rosa are found on the Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve. Beeks Place, a small house foundation still owned by the family, is also located here.

The mountains were the site of the Indian massacre of Puhú village in 1831 in Black Star Canyon.

== Natural resources ==
===Flora===
As part of the California Floristic Province, the Santa Ana Mountains host a diverse array of plant species within distinctive natural (plant) communities, including coastal sage scrub, chaparral, riparian woodland, southern oak woodland, rocky outcrop, vernal pool, valley grassland, and closed-cone montane coniferous forest. One of the southernmost stands of madrones can be found in Trabuco Canyon. Groves of knobcone pine can be found around Pleasants Peak. Big-cone Douglas fir and Coulter pine can be found at the higher elevations. Rare flowers like the intermediate Mariposa lily, heart-leaved pitcher sage (associated with the Tecate cypress), and chocolate lily are difficult to find. Fragrant sages, broadleaf evergreen shrubs and trees, perennial bunchgrasses, succulents (&quot;Dudleya&quot; species), and fire-following flowers grow in the rugged terrain. Numerous ferns, including large sword ferns, are found under trees and near streams, especially at higher elevations.

===Fauna===
A surprising variety of wildlife species can be found, including mountain lion, mule deer, bobcat, coyote, gray fox, American badger, ring-tailed cat, spotted skunk, western gray squirrel, long-tailed weasel, dusky-footed woodrat, kangaroo rat, bats, spotted owl, western pond turtle, steelhead, coast horned lizard, least Bell&#x27;s vireo, golden eagle, mountain quail, canyon wren, speckled rattlesnake, Pacific rattlesnake, common kingsnake, gopher snake, western fence lizard, arroyo toad, western spadefoot toad, California tree frog, California sister butterfly, various &quot;Aphonopelma&quot; species of tarantula, and many more.

The last wild California grizzly bear in the Santa Ana Mountains was shot and killed in the mountains in 1908. Gray wolf, pronghorn, California condor and possibly jaguar were also once found in the range.

===Minerals===
A number of minerals have been mined in the range, though none were very profitable. Commercial resources collected since the 1870s have included metals such as lead, silver, tin, and zinc, and minerals such as clay, coal, gypsum, and limestone. Parts of the range have been used to graze domestic livestock and harvest timber since the late 18th century. As the surrounding cities have grown, the water of the range&#x27;s creeks has become a particularly valued resource.

== Transportation ==
The mountains form a natural barrier between the Inland Empire region to the east and the job centers of Orange County to the west. Only one freeway, the Riverside Freeway (State Route 91), the tolled Foothill and Eastern Transportation Corridor (State Route 241), and the two-lane Ortega Highway (State Route 74) connect the regions. Highway 91, which follows the Santa Ana River through a pass between the Santa Ana Mountains on the south and the Chino Hills on the north, is one of California&#x27;s most congested routes. Because of this, several proposals have been floated to excavate a highway tunnel through the Santa Ana Mountains, although the multibillion-dollar idea has drawn criticism from environmentalists and others concerned about cost and safety in the earthquake-prone region. While Highway 91 is one of the most congested routes in California, Highway 74 holds a more ominous claim as one of the most dangerous highways in the state. State route 241 starts in Mission Viejo and runs alongside the foothills of the Santa Ana&#x27;s while merging with State Route 133 and 261. The highway finishes at the junction with State Route 91.

<text>Tales of the City is a series of ten novels written by American author Armistead Maupin from 1978 to 2024, depicting the life of a group of friends in San Francisco, many of whom are LGBTQ. The stories from &quot;Tales&quot; were originally serialized prior to their novelization, with the first four titles appearing as regular installments in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, while the fifth appeared in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. The remaining titles were never serialized, but were instead originally written as novels.

&quot;Tales of the City&quot; has been compared to similar serial novels that ran in other city newspapers, such as &quot;The Serial&quot; (1976; Marin County), &quot;Tangled Lives&quot; (Boston), &quot;Bagtime&quot; (Chicago), and &quot;Federal Triangle&quot; (Washington, D.C.).

Characters from the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; series have appeared in supporting roles in Maupin&#x27;s later novels &quot;Maybe the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Night Listener&quot;.

==Titles in the series ==
# &quot;Tales of the City&quot; (1978)
# &quot;More Tales of the City&quot; (1980)
# &quot;Further Tales of the City&quot; (1982)
# &quot;Babycakes&quot; (1984)
# &quot;Significant Others&quot; (1987)
# &quot;Sure of You&quot; (1989)
# &quot;Michael Tolliver Lives&quot; (2007)
# &quot;Mary Ann in Autumn&quot; (2010)
# &quot;The Days of Anna Madrigal&quot; (2014)
# &quot;Mona of the Manor&quot; (2024)

==Core characters==
The series opens with the arrival of Mary Ann Singleton, a naive young woman from Cleveland, Ohio, who is visiting San Francisco on vacation when she impulsively decides to stay. She finds an apartment at 28 Barbary Lane, the domain of the eccentric, marijuana-growing landlady Anna Madrigal, later revealed to be a transgender woman. Mary Ann becomes friends with other tenants of the building: the hippyish, bisexual Mona Ramsey; heterosexual lothario Brian Hawkins; the sinister and cagey roof tenant Norman Neal Williams; and Michael Tolliver, a sweet and personable gay man known to friends as Mouse (as in Mickey).

Beyond the house, lovers and friends guide Mary Ann through her San Francisco adventures. Edgar Halcyon, Mary Ann&#x27;s and Mona&#x27;s boss; Edgar&#x27;s socialite daughter DeDe Halcyon-Day (a character based on real-life art patron Dede Wilsey); and DeDe&#x27;s scheming bisexual husband Beauchamp Day all provide a glimpse into a more affluent Californian class. Mother Mucca, Mrs. Madrigal&#x27;s mother and owner of the Blue Moon Lodge brothel, brings mystery and comic relief. D&#x27;orothea Wilson returns from a modeling assignment in New York to resume an affair with Mona. Jon Fielding, Michael&#x27;s lover and DeDe&#x27;s gynecologist, becomes part of the social group. Michael&#x27;s lovers later in the series include Thack Sweeney and the significantly younger Ben McKenna.

==Realism in the series==

Because installments were published so soon after Maupin wrote them, he was able to incorporate many current events into the plot of the series, as well as gauge reader response and modify the story accordingly.

For example, Maupin once received a letter from a reader of the original serial, who pointed out that Anna Madrigal&#x27;s name was an anagram for &quot;A Man and a Girl&quot;, and Maupin &quot;appropriated the idea&quot;.

The AIDS epidemic of the 1980s affected San Francisco&#x27;s gay community in particular (with many of Maupin&#x27;s friends dying), which is reflected in the later books of the series.

Real life people such as Jim Jones and a thinly veiled Elizabeth Taylor are mentioned in the story lines. A prominent closeted gay celebrity is represented as &quot;______ ______&quot; throughout the third novel, a reference to Rock Hudson, who was a friend of Maupin.

==Series revival ==
Nearly two decades after &quot;Sure of You&quot;, Maupin resumed the series with the release of the novel &quot;Michael Tolliver Lives&quot;. Maupin originally stated that the novel was &quot;NOT a sequel... and it&#x27;s certainly not Book 7 in the series&quot;; however, he later conceded:
&quot;Michael Tolliver Lives&quot; was criticized by one critic for its thinly veiled autobiographical nature and for being the work of a beloved author trying to remember how he did it first time round. Maupin&#x27;s next novel in the series, &quot;Mary Ann in Autumn&quot;, returned to the style of the earlier &quot;Tales&quot; books, a multi-character tapestry of interwoven story lines. The novel &quot;The Days of Anna Madrigal&quot; was released on January 21, 2014.

==Television adaptations==
The first book was made into a 1993 television miniseries, produced by Channel 4 in the UK and screened by PBS in the US the next year. Showtime debuted the second and third installments, in 1998 and 2001, respectively; all featured Laura Linney as Mary Ann Singleton, Olympia Dukakis as Anna Madrigal, and Barbara Garrick as DeDe Halcyon-Day.

In 2019, Netflix produced a sequel miniseries. Laura Linney, Olympia Dukakis, Paul Gross and Barbara Garrick all reprised their roles. Linney and Maupin were executive producers, Alan Poul directed, and Michael Cunningham wrote the first episode script. While not a direct adaptation of any of Maupin&#x27;s novels like the first three miniseries were, this 10-part series takes the core characters along with certain characters and elements from Maupin&#x27;s later &quot;Tales&quot; novels and weaves them into a new story set mostly in the present day.

== Radio adaptations ==
All of the books have been adapted and broadcast on BBC Radio 4. The BBC series names and first broadcast dates are:

# &quot;Tales of the City&quot; (January/February 2013)
# &quot;More Tales of the City&quot; (February 2013)
# &quot;Further Tales of the City&quot; (July 2014)
# &quot;Babycakes&quot; (July 2014)
# &quot;Significant Others&quot; (June/July 2015) which also includes &quot;Sure of You&quot;.
# &quot;Michael Tolliver Lives&quot; (May 2016)
# &quot;Mary Ann in Autumn&quot; (May 2016)
# &quot;The Days of Anna Madrigal&quot; (July 2017)

==Musical adaptations==
Maupin has collaborated on several &quot;Tales&quot;-themed musical projects. In March 1999, he participated in &quot;Tunes from Tales (Music for Mouse)&quot;, a concert series with the Seattle Men&#x27;s Chorus that included readings from the series and music from the era. Maupin provided a new libretto for &quot;Anna Madrigal Remembers&quot;, a musical work composed by Jake Heggie and performed by choir Chanticleer and mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade on 6 August 1999.

After a developmental reading at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center&#x27;s National Music Theater Conference in 2009, &quot;Armistead Maupin&#x27;s Tales of the City&quot; premiered at the American Conservatory Theater in 2011, with a book by Jeff Whitty and the score by Jake Shears and John &quot;JJ&quot; Garden. The musical stage adaptation ran for two months with direction by Jason Moore, and a cast featuring Judy Kaye as Anna Madrigal, Betsy Wolfe as Mary Ann Singleton, Mary Birdsong as Mona Ramsey, and Wesley Taylor as Michael &quot;Mouse&quot; Tolliver. Reviews were generally positive, with new songs that &quot;range from bawdy comic numbers to traditional solo ballads in which the principals give vent to the secret suffering in their hearts.&quot;

==Critical reception==

In 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Tales of the City&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

<doc id="746066" wikidata="Q2877360" url="?curid=746066" title="FAST TCP">
<text>FAST TCP (also written FastTCP) is a TCP congestion avoidance algorithm especially targeted at long-distance, high latency links, developed at the Netlab, California Institute of Technology and now being commercialized by FastSoft. FastSoft was acquired by Akamai Technologies in 2012.

FastTCP is compatible with existing TCP algorithms, requiring modification only to the computer which is sending data.

==Name==
The name FAST is a recursive acronym for FAST AQM Scalable TCP, where AQM stands for Active Queue Management, and TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.

==Principles of operation==
The role of congestion control is to moderate the rate at which data is transmitted, &quot;congestion&quot;, according to the capacity of the network and the rate at which other users are transmitting. Like TCP Vegas, FAST TCP uses queueing delay instead of loss probability as a congestion signal.

Most current congestion control algorithms detect congestion and slow down when they discover that packets are being dropped, so that the average sending rate depends on the loss probability. This has two drawbacks. First, low loss probabilities are required to sustain high data rates; in the case of TCP Reno, very low loss probabilities are required, but even new congestion avoidance algorithms such as H-TCP, BIC TCP and HSTCP require loss rates lower than those provided by most wireless wide area networks. Moreover, packet loss only provides a single bit of information about the congestion level, whereas delay is a continuous quantity and in principle provides more information about the network.

A FAST TCP flow seeks to maintain a constant number of packets in queues throughout the network. The number of packets in queues is estimated by measuring the difference between the observed round trip time (RTT) and the &quot;base RTT&quot;, defined as the round trip time when there is no queueing. The base RTT is estimated as the minimum observed RTT for the connection. If too few packets are queued, the sending rate is increased, while if too many are queued, the rate is decreased. In this respect, it is a direct descendant of TCP Vegas.

The difference between TCP Vegas and FAST TCP lies in the way in which the rate is adjusted when the number of packets stored is too small or large. TCP Vegas makes fixed size adjustments to the rate, independent of how far the current rate is from the target rate. FAST TCP makes larger steps when the system is further from equilibrium and smaller steps near equilibrium. This improves the speed of convergence and the stability.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
Delay-based algorithms can, in principle, maintain a constant window size, avoiding the oscillations inherent in loss-based algorithms. However, they also detect congestion earlier than loss-based algorithms, since delay corresponds to partially filled buffers, while loss results from totally filled buffers. This can be either a strength or a weakness. If the only protocol used in a network is delay-based, then the inefficiency of loss can be avoided; however, if loss-based and delay-based protocols share the network, then delay-based algorithms tend to be less aggressive. This can be overcome by suitable choice of parameters, leading to complex interactions studied by Tang et al.

Delay measurements are also subject to jitter as a result of operating system scheduling, or bus contention.

Whether the strengths or weaknesses prevail is not clear, and depends in large part on the particular scenario.

Propagation delay is used in the FAST window control algorithm. In a clean network, the queueing delay maintained by existing FAST flows may be mistaken as part of the propagation delay by new flows that join later, as shown in ns-2 simulations in. The effect of this estimation error is equivalent to modifying the underlying utility functions to favor new flows over existing flows. Method to eliminate this error is suggested in.

==Generalized FAST TCP==
FAST TCP has been shown to be promising in terms of system stability, throughput and fairness. However,
it requires buffering which increases linearly with the number of flows bottlenecked at a link. The paper 
proposes a new TCP algorithm that extends FAST TCP to achieve (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)-proportional fairness in steady
state, yielding buffer requirements which grow only as the nth power of the number of flows. The authors call
the new algorithm Generalized FAST TCP. They prove stability for the case of a single bottleneck link with
homogeneous sources in the absence of feedback delay. Simulation results verify that the new scheme is
stable in the presence of feedback delay, and that its buffering requirements can be made to scale significantly
better than standard FAST TCP.

==Intellectual property==
Unlike most TCP congestion avoidance algorithms, FAST TCP is protected by several patents. Instead of seeking standardization by the IETF, the inventors of FAST, notably Steven H. Low and Cheng Jin, are seeking to commercialize it through the company FastSoft. Currently FastSoft sells a 1-Unit rack appliance which can be deployed at the sender-side with no other software or hardware modifications needed on either end.

<doc id="746070" wikidata="Q258060" url="?curid=746070" title="Chutzpah">
<text>Chutzpah ( - ) is the quality of audacity, for good or for bad. A close English equivalent is sometimes &quot;hubris&quot;. The word derives from the Hebrew &quot;&quot; (), meaning &quot;insolence&quot;, &quot;cheek&quot; or &quot;audacity&quot;. Thus, the original Yiddish word has a strongly negative connotation, but the form which entered English as a Yiddishism in American English has taken on a broader meaning, having been popularized through vernacular use in film, literature, and television. In American English the word is sometimes interpreted—particularly in business parlance—as meaning the amount of courage, mettle or ardor that an individual has.

==Etymology==
The term entered the English language some time between 1890–95 from Yiddish חוצפּה (ḥuṣpâ). It was used in Mishnaic Hebrew, חוֹצְפָּה (ḥôṣǝpâ), from חָצַף (ḥāṣap, “to be insolent”), though it is believed to come initially from Aramaic, חֲצִיפָא (ḥăṣîpāʾ), חֲצַף (ḥaṣap, “to be barefaced, insolent”).

In Hebrew, &quot;chutzpah&quot; is used ly, to describe someone who has overstepped the boundaries of accepted behavior. In traditional usage, the word expresses a strong sense of disapproval, condemnation and outrage.

Leo Rosten in &quot;The Joys of Yiddish&quot; defines chutzpah as &quot;gall, brazen nerve, effrontery, incredible &#x27;guts&#x27;, presumption plus arrogance such as no other word and no other language can do justice to&quot;. In this sense, &quot;chutzpah&quot; expresses both strong disapproval and condemnation. In the same work, Rosten also defines the term as &quot;that quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan&quot;.

&quot;Chutzpah&quot; amounts to a total denial of personal responsibility, which renders others speechless and incredulous.

The cognate of &quot;ḥuṣpāh&quot; in Classical Arabic, &quot;&quot; (), does not mean &quot;impudence&quot; or &quot;cheekiness&quot; or anything similar, but rather &quot;sound judgment&quot;.

== Rabbinical literature ==

Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis distinguishes the meaning of &quot;chutzpah&quot; as stubbornness and contrariness from what he calls a tradition of &quot;spiritual audacity&quot; or &quot;chutzpah klapei shmaya&quot;:

As an example, Schulweis cites a case where Moses argues with God about the justice of His commands:

== English usage ==

=== Israeli politics ===

The word Chutzpah is sometimes used in discussions of Israeli politics. For example: &quot;Will Far-right Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s Chutzpah Trigger a Third Intifada?&quot; was the headline of an article in Haaretz, by Amos Harel, their military and defense analyst in both Hebrew and English, in February 2023.

=== Yiddish legal opinion ===

Judge Alex Kozinski and Eugene Volokh in an article entitled &quot;Lawsuit Shmawsuit&quot;, note the rise in use of Yiddish words in legal opinion. They note that &quot;chutzpah&quot; has been used 231 times in American legal opinions, 220 of those after 1980. &quot;Chutzpah&quot; first appeared in a Supreme Court decision in 1998, in National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, when Justice Antonin Scalia used it to describe the NEA&#x27;s brazenness in asking for government funding.

== Other languages ==
The Polish word &quot;hucpa&quot; (pronounced [ˈxut͜spa]) is also derived from this term, although its meaning is closer to &#x27;insolence&#x27; or &#x27;arrogance&#x27;, and so it is typically used in a more negative sense instead of denoting a positive description of someone&#x27;s audacity.

Similarly, the German form of &quot;chutzpah&quot; is &quot;Chuzpe&quot;. In Czech, &quot;chucpe&quot; is commonly used with a sharply negative connotation. The Dutch noun &quot;gotspe&quot; is also related and refers to a brazen or shameless act or situation.
==In popular culture==
In the Hindi-language film &quot;Haider&quot; (2014) by Vishal Bharadwaj, a modern-day interpretation of Hamlet set against the backdrop of Kashmir in the midst of political conflict, the protagonist uses the word, which he pronounce as /&#x27;tʃʊtspə/ instead of /ˈhʊtspə/ or /ˈxʊtspə/ to describe India&#x27;s way of treating the people of Kashmir since the beginning of the conflict.

A Hindi-language streaming television series titled &quot;Chutzpah&quot; premiered on Sony Liv in 2021.

<text>Coles Bashford (January 24, 1816April 25, 1878) was an American lawyer and politician who became the fifth governor of Wisconsin, and one of the founders of the U.S. Republican Party. His one term as governor ended in a bribery scandal that ended in him fleeing Wisconsin, but he was later instrumental in the government of the newly formed Arizona Territory.

==Early life and career==
Bashford was born near Cold Spring in Putnam County, New York. He attended the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in Lima, where he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1842. He served as the District Attorney of Wayne County from 1847 until he resigned in 1850 and moved to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He served in the Wisconsin State Senate in 1853 and 1854 as a Whig, representing Winnebago County. After the Whigs split on the issue of abolition, Bashford became one of the founding candidates of the Republican Party.

==1855 election scandal==
Bashford ran for governor as a Republican in 1855 and was at first declared the loser to the Democratic incumbent, William A. Barstow, by a mere 157 votes. However, Bashford claimed the result was fraudulent, and it was later discovered that Barstow&#x27;s win was due to forged election returns coming from non-existent precincts in the sparsely populated northern part of the state, in addition to other irregularities such as two separate canvassing boards claiming legitimacy in Waupaca County. With rival militia units converging on the state capitol in Madison, Bashford was sworn in quietly in the chambers of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, by Chief Justice Edward Whiton, on January 7, 1856.

On the same day, Barstow was publicly inaugurated with full ceremony. The Wisconsin Attorney General filed quo warranto proceedings in the Wisconsin Supreme Court to remove Barstow, who declared that he would not &quot;give up his office alive.&quot; After challenging the court&#x27;s jurisdiction without success and noting that the tide of public opinion had turned against him, Barstow declined to contest the fraud allegations and sent his resignation to the legislature on March 21, 1856, leaving the lieutenant governor, Arthur MacArthur, as acting governor. On March 24, the court unanimously awarded the governorship to Bashford by a count of 1,009 votes. Bashford was represented in the case by Edward G. Ryan, who, two decades later, would serve as Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

The following day, as Madison was crowded with onlookers, Bashford entered the Capitol with the court&#x27;s judgment in hand, in the company of a sheriff and a throng of followers, and announced to MacArthur that he had come to claim his office. Upon Bashford&#x27;s threat that force would be used if necessary, MacArthur and his supporters quickly left. Despite initial opposition by the Democrats in the State Assembly, both houses of the Wisconsin State Legislature soon recognized Bashford as the new governor.

==Term as governor and railroad scandal==
As governor, Bashford appointed the first Black officeholder to Wisconsin state office when he made barber and entrepreneur William Noland a notary public in 1857. Bashford declined renomination from the Republican Party and left office at the end of his term on January 4, 1858.

Mere weeks later, an investigation was launched regarding bribes that he and members of his administration had accepted from the La Crosse &amp; Milwaukee Railroad Company in exchange for approval of a major land grant. Bashford himself had received the largest payoff in the form of $50,000 in stocks and $15,000 in cash from the railroad company; state legislators and a Wisconsin Supreme Court justice were also involved in payoffs exceeding $400,000 in total. Nearly every copy of the final investigative report was seized and burned by the implicated politicians, but public outrage spread despite the suppression.

Bashford managed to cash in his stock before the railroad company folded as a result of the investigation, and fled the state. He traveled first to Washington, D.C., in 1862, and then left for the Arizona Territory, in 1863, with his brother, Levi, who was to be Surveyor General of the newly created territory. They made the arduous, cross-continental journey accompanying the &quot;Governor&#x27;s party&quot;—the appointed territorial officials led by Governor John Noble Goodwin—and arrived in the Arizona Territory in December 1863.

==Arizona Territory career==
Though moving to the Territory as a private citizen, Bashford was soon appointed its first Attorney General by Governor Goodwin, serving from 1864 until 1866. His position required him to journey throughout the Territory, frequently travelling through land considered &quot;hostile Indian country&quot;, but he executed these duties without incident. Bashford was also the first lawyer admitted to practice in the Arizona Territorial Courts and compiled the session laws of the Territory into one 400-page volume with the assistance of Associate Justice William T. Howell. He was elected President of the first Territorial Council (the Territory&#x27;s upper legislative body) in 1864 and served from 1867 until 1869 as a territorial delegate to the 40th United States Congress as an independent, rather than with his former party.

The last political office Bashford held was Secretary of State for the Arizona Territory, by appointment from U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869, and again in 1873. After the Territory&#x27;s capital moved from Prescott, where Bashford and Levi ran the Bashford Mercantile Store, Bashford resigned in 1876 to stay close to his business interests. He died in Prescott two years later. Bashford was buried in Mountain View Cemetery, in Oakland, California. He and his wife Frances Adams had seven children: Belle (who had died at age 11), Edward, Elizabeth, Helen, Lillian, Margaret, and William Coles. The Bashford Mercantile Store remained operating in Prescott until the 1940s.

<text>Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus, is a mathematical discipline focused on limits, continuity, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. Many elements of calculus appeared in ancient Greece, then in China and the Middle East, and still later again in medieval Europe and in India. Infinitesimal calculus was developed in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently of each other. An argument over priority led to the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy which continued until the death of Leibniz in 1716. The development of calculus and its uses within the sciences have continued to the present.

==Etymology==

In mathematics education, &quot;calculus&quot; denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word &quot;calculus&quot; is Latin for &quot;small pebble&quot; (the diminutive of &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;stone&quot;), a meaning which still persists in medicine. Because such pebbles were used for counting out distances, tallying votes, and doing abacus arithmetic, the word came to mean a method of computation. In this sense, it was used in English at least as early as 1672, several years prior to the publications of Leibniz and Newton.

In addition to the differential calculus and integral calculus, the term is also used widely for naming specific methods of calculation. Examples of this include propositional calculus in logic, the calculus of variations in mathematics, process calculus in computing, and the felicific calculus in philosophy.

==Early precursors of calculus==
===Ancient===

====Egypt and Babylonia====

The ancient period introduced some of the ideas that led to integral calculus, but does not seem to have developed these ideas in a rigorous and systematic way. Calculations of volumes and areas, one goal of integral calculus, can be found in the Egyptian Moscow papyrus (), but the formulas are only given for concrete numbers, some are only approximately true, and they are not derived by deductive reasoning. Babylonians may have discovered the trapezoidal rule while doing astronomical observations of Jupiter.

====Greece====
From the age of Greek mathematics, Eudoxus (c. 408–355 BC) used the method of exhaustion, which foreshadows the concept of the limit, to calculate areas and volumes, while Archimedes (c. 287–212 BC) developed this idea further, inventing heuristics which resemble the methods of integral calculus. Greek mathematicians are also credited with a significant use of infinitesimals. Democritus is the first person recorded to consider seriously the division of objects into an infinite number of cross-sections, but his inability to rationalize discrete cross-sections with a cone&#x27;s smooth slope prevented him from accepting the idea. At approximately the same time, Zeno of Elea discredited infinitesimals further by his articulation of the paradoxes which they seemingly create.

Archimedes developed this method further, while also inventing heuristic methods which resemble modern day concepts somewhat in his &quot;The Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;, &quot;The Method&quot;, and &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot;. It should not be thought that infinitesimals were put on a rigorous footing during this time, however. Only when it was supplemented by a proper geometric proof would Greek mathematicians accept a proposition as true. It was not until the 17th century that the method was formalized by Cavalieri as the method of Indivisibles and eventually incorporated by Newton into a general framework of integral calculus. Archimedes was the first to find the tangent to a curve other than a circle, in a method akin to differential calculus. While studying the spiral, he separated a point&#x27;s motion into two components, one radial motion component and one circular motion component, and then continued to add the two component motions together, thereby finding the tangent to the curve.

====China====

The method of exhaustion was independently invented in China by Liu Hui in the 4th century AD in order to find the area of a circle. In the 5th century, Zu Chongzhi established a method that would later be called Cavalieri&#x27;s principle to find the volume of a sphere.

===Medieval===
====Middle East====
In the Middle East, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinized as Alhazen ( AD) derived a formula for the sum of fourth powers. He used the results to carry out what would now be called an integration, where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid. Roshdi Rashed has argued that the 12th century mathematician Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī must have used the derivative of cubic polynomials in his &quot;Treatise on Equations&quot;. Rashed&#x27;s conclusion has been contested by other scholars, who argue that he could have obtained his results by other methods which do not require the derivative of the function to be known.

====India====

Evidence suggests Bhāskara II was acquainted with some ideas of differential calculus. Bhāskara also goes deeper into the &#x27;differential calculus&#x27; and suggests the differential coefficient vanishes at an extremum value of the function, indicating knowledge of the concept of &#x27;infinitesimals&#x27;. There is evidence of an early form of Rolle&#x27;s theorem in his work. The modern formulation of Rolle&#x27;s theorem states that if formula_1, then formula_2 for some formula_3 with formula_4. In his astronomical work, Bhāskara gives a result that looks like a precursor to infinitesimal methods: if formula_5 then formula_6. This leads to the derivative of the sine function, although he did not develop the notion of a derivative.

Some ideas on calculus later appeared in Indian mathematics, at the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. Madhava of Sangamagrama in the 14th century, and later mathematicians of the Kerala school, stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. They considered series equivalent to the Maclaurin expansions of , , and more than two hundred years before they were studied in Europe but they did not combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today.

====Europe====
The mathematical study of continuity was revived in the 14th century by the Oxford Calculators and French collaborators such as Nicole Oresme. They proved the &quot;Merton mean speed theorem&quot;: that a uniformly accelerated body travels the same distance as a body with uniform speed whose speed is half the final velocity of the accelerated body.

==Modern precursors==
=== Integrals ===
Johannes Kepler&#x27;s work &quot;Stereometrica Doliorum&quot; published in 1615 formed the basis of integral calculus. Kepler developed a method to calculate the area of an ellipse by adding up the lengths of many radii drawn from a focus of the ellipse.

A significant work was a treatise inspired by Kepler&#x27;s methods published in 1635 by Bonaventura Cavalieri on his method of indivisibles. He argued that volumes and areas should be computed as the sums of the volumes and areas of infinitesimally thin cross-sections. He discovered Cavalieri&#x27;s quadrature formula which gave the area under the curves &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; of higher degree. This had previously been computed in a similar way for the parabola by Archimedes in &quot;The Method&quot;, but this treatise is believed to have been lost in the 13th century, and was only rediscovered in the early 20th century, and so would have been unknown to Cavalieri. Cavalieri&#x27;s work was not well respected since his methods could lead to erroneous results, and the infinitesimal quantities he introduced were disreputable at first.

Torricelli extended Cavalieri&#x27;s work to other curves such as the cycloid, and then the formula was generalized to fractional and negative powers by Wallis in 1656. In a 1659 treatise, Fermat is credited with an ingenious trick for evaluating the integral of any power function directly. Fermat also obtained a technique for finding the centers of gravity of various plane and solid figures, which influenced further work in quadrature.

=== Derivatives ===
In the 17th century, European mathematicians Isaac Barrow, René Descartes, Pierre de Fermat, Blaise Pascal, John Wallis and others discussed the idea of a derivative. In particular, in &quot;Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minima&quot; and in &quot;De tangentibus linearum curvarum&quot; distributed in 1636, Fermat introduced the concept of adequality, which represented equality up to an infinitesimal error term. This method could be used to determine the maxima, minima, and tangents to various curves and was closely related to differentiation.

Isaac Newton would later write that his own early ideas about calculus came directly from &quot;Fermat&#x27;s way of drawing tangents.&quot;

=== Fundamental theorem of calculus ===
The formal study of calculus brought together Cavalieri&#x27;s infinitesimals with the calculus of finite differences developed in Europe at around the same time, and Fermat&#x27;s adequality. The combination was achieved by John Wallis, Isaac Barrow, and James Gregory, the latter two proving predecessors to the second fundamental theorem of calculus around 1670.

James Gregory, influenced by Fermat&#x27;s contributions both to tangency and to quadrature, was then able to prove a restricted version of the second fundamental theorem of calculus, that integrals can be computed using any of a function&#x27;s antiderivatives.

The first full proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus was given by Isaac Barrow.

=== Other developments ===

One prerequisite to the establishment of a calculus of functions of a real variable involved finding an antiderivative for the rational function formula_7 This problem can be phrased as quadrature of the rectangular hyperbola &quot;xy&quot; = 1. In 1647 Gregoire de Saint-Vincent noted that the required function &quot;F&quot; satisfied formula_8 so that a geometric sequence became, under &quot;F&quot;, an arithmetic sequence. A. A. de Sarasa associated this feature with contemporary algorithms called &quot;logarithms&quot; that economized arithmetic by rendering multiplications into additions. So &quot;F&quot; was first known as the hyperbolic logarithm. After Euler exploited e = 2.71828..., and &quot;F&quot; was identified as the inverse function of the exponential function, it became the natural logarithm, satisfying formula_9

The first proof of Rolle&#x27;s theorem was given by Michel Rolle in 1691 using methods developed by the Dutch mathematician Johann van Waveren Hudde. The mean value theorem in its modern form was stated by Bernard Bolzano and Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) also after the founding of modern calculus. Important contributions were made by Barrow, Huygens, and many others.

Barrow has been credited by some authors as having invented calculus, however, Swiss mathematician Florian Cajori notes that while Barrow did work out a set of &quot;geometric theorems suggesting to us constructions by which we can find lines, areas and volumes whose magnitudes are ordinarily found by the analytical processes of the calculus&quot;, he did not create &quot;what by common agreement of mathematicians has been designated by the term differential and integral calculus&quot;, and further notes that &quot;Two processes yielding equivalent results are not necessarily the same&quot;. Cajori finishes with stating that &quot;The invention belongs rightly belongs to Newton and Leibniz&quot;.

==Newton and Leibniz==


Before Newton and Leibniz, the word &quot;calculus&quot; referred to any body of mathematics, but in the following years, &quot;calculus&quot; became a popular term for a field of mathematics based upon their insights. Newton and Leibniz, building on this work, independently developed the surrounding theory of infinitesimal calculus in the late 17th century. Also, Leibniz did a great deal of work with developing consistent and useful notation and concepts. Newton provided some of the most important applications to physics, especially of integral calculus.

By the middle of the 17th century, European mathematics had changed its primary repository of knowledge. In comparison to the last century which maintained Hellenistic mathematics as the starting point for research, Newton, Leibniz and their contemporaries increasingly looked towards the works of more modern thinkers.

Newton came to calculus as part of his investigations in physics and geometry. He viewed calculus as the scientific description of the generation of motion and magnitudes. In comparison, Leibniz focused on the tangent problem and came to believe that calculus was a metaphysical explanation of change. Importantly, the core of their insight was the formalization of the inverse properties between the integral and the differential of a function. This insight had been anticipated by their predecessors, but they were the first to conceive calculus as a system in which new rhetoric and descriptive terms were created.

===Newton===
Newton completed no definitive publication formalizing his fluxional calculus; rather, many of his mathematical discoveries were transmitted through correspondence, smaller papers or as embedded aspects in his other definitive compilations, such as the &quot;Principia&quot; and &quot;Opticks&quot;. Newton would begin his mathematical training as the chosen heir of Isaac Barrow in Cambridge. His aptitude was recognized early and he quickly learned the current theories. By 1664 Newton had made his first important contribution by advancing the binomial theorem, which he had extended to include fractional and negative exponents. Newton succeeded in expanding the applicability of the binomial theorem by applying the algebra of finite quantities in an analysis of infinite series. He showed a willingness to view infinite series not only as approximate devices, but also as alternative forms of expressing a term.

Newton&#x27;s formulated his calculus between the years 1664 to 1666, later describing them as, &quot;the prime of my age for invention and minded mathematics and [natural] philosophy more than at any time since.&quot; A manuscript dated May 20, 1665 showed that Newton &quot;had already developed the calculus to the point where he could compute the tangent and the curvature at any point of a continuous curve.&quot; It was during his plague-induced isolation that the first written conception of fluxionary calculus was recorded in the unpublished &quot;De Analysi per Aequationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas&quot;. In this paper, he determined the area under a curve by first calculating a momentary rate of change and then extrapolating the total area. He began by reasoning about an indefinitely small triangle whose area is a function of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. He then reasoned that the infinitesimal increase in the abscissa will create a new formula where (importantly, &quot;o&quot; is the letter, not the digit 0). He then recalculated the area with the aid of the binomial theorem, removed all quantities containing the letter &quot;o&quot; and re-formed an algebraic expression for the area. Significantly, Newton would then &quot;blot out&quot; the quantities containing &quot;o&quot; because terms &quot;multiplied by it will be nothing in respect to the rest&quot;.

At this point Newton had begun to realize the central property of inversion. He had created an expression for the area under a curve by considering a momentary increase at a point. In effect, the fundamental theorem of calculus was built into his calculations. While his new formulation offered incredible potential, Newton was well aware of its logical limitations at the time. He admits that &quot;errors are not to be disregarded in mathematics, no matter how small&quot; and that what he had achieved was &quot;shortly explained rather than accurately demonstrated&quot;.

In an effort to give calculus a more rigorous explication and framework, Newton compiled in 1671 the &quot;Methodus Fluxionum et Serierum Infinitarum&quot;. In this book, Newton&#x27;s strict empiricism shaped and defined his fluxional calculus. He exploited instantaneous motion and infinitesimals informally. He used math as a methodological tool to explain the physical world. The base of Newton&#x27;s revised calculus became continuity; as such he redefined his calculations in terms of continual flowing motion. For Newton, variable magnitudes are not aggregates of infinitesimal elements, but are generated by the indisputable fact of motion. As with many of his works, Newton delayed publication. &quot;Methodus Fluxionum&quot; was not published until 1736.

Newton attempted to avoid the use of the infinitesimal by forming calculations based on ratios of changes. In the &quot;Methodus Fluxionum&quot; he defined the rate of generated change as a fluxion, which he represented by a dotted letter, and the quantity generated he defined as a fluent. For example, if formula_10 and formula_11 are fluents, then formula_12 and formula_13 are their respective fluxions. This revised calculus of ratios continued to be developed and was maturely stated in the 1676 text &quot;De Quadratura Curvarum&quot; where Newton came to define the present day derivative as the ultimate ratio of change, which he defined as the ratio between evanescent increments (the ratio of fluxions) purely at the moment in question. Essentially, the ultimate ratio is the ratio as the increments vanish into nothingness. Importantly, Newton explained the existence of the ultimate ratio by appealing to motion:For by the ultimate velocity is meant that, with which the body is moved, neither before it arrives at its last place, when the motion ceases nor after but at the very instant when it arrives... the ultimate ratio of evanescent quantities is to be understood, the ratio of quantities not before they vanish, not after, but with which they vanishNewton developed his fluxional calculus in an attempt to evade the informal use of infinitesimals in his calculations.

===Leibniz===
While Newton began development of his fluxional calculus in 1665–1666 his findings did not become widely circulated until later. In the intervening years Leibniz also strove to create his calculus. In comparison to Newton who came to math at an early age, Leibniz began his rigorous math studies with a mature intellect. He was a polymath, and his intellectual interests and achievements involved metaphysics, law, economics, politics, logic, and mathematics. In order to understand Leibniz&#x27;s reasoning in calculus his background should be kept in mind. Particularly, his metaphysics which described the universe as a Monadology, and his plans of creating a precise formal logic whereby, &quot;a general method in which all truths of the reason would be reduced to a kind of calculation&quot;.

In 1672, Leibniz met the mathematician Huygens who convinced Leibniz to dedicate significant time to the study of mathematics. By 1673 he had progressed to reading Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Traité des sinus du quart de cercle&quot; and it was during his largely autodidactic research that Leibniz said &quot;a light turned on&quot;. Like Newton, Leibniz saw the tangent as a ratio but declared it as simply the ratio between ordinates and abscissas. He continued this reasoning to argue that the integral was in fact the sum of the ordinates for infinitesimal intervals in the abscissa; in effect, the sum of an infinite number of rectangles. From these definitions the inverse relationship or differential became clear and Leibniz quickly realized the potential to form a whole new system of mathematics. Where Newton over the course of his career used several approaches in addition to an approach using infinitesimals, Leibniz made this the cornerstone of his notation and calculus.

In the manuscripts of 25 October to 11 November 1675, Leibniz recorded his discoveries and experiments with various forms of notation. He was acutely aware of the notational terms used and his earlier plans to form a precise logical symbolism became evident. Eventually, Leibniz denoted the infinitesimal increments of abscissas and ordinates &quot;dx&quot; and &quot;dy&quot;, and the summation of infinitely many infinitesimally thin rectangles as a long s (∫ ), which became the present integral symbol formula_14.

While Leibniz&#x27;s notation is used by modern mathematics, his logical base was different from our current one. Leibniz embraced infinitesimals and wrote extensively so as, &quot;not to make of the infinitely small a mystery, as had Pascal.&quot; According to Gilles Deleuze, Leibniz&#x27;s zeroes &quot;are nothings, but they are not absolute nothings, they are nothings respectively&quot; (quoting Leibniz&#x27; text &quot;Justification of the calculus of infinitesimals by the calculus of ordinary algebra&quot;). Alternatively, he defines them as, &quot;less than any given quantity&quot;. For Leibniz, the world was an aggregate of infinitesimal points and the lack of scientific proof for their existence did not trouble him. Infinitesimals to Leibniz were ideal quantities of a different type from appreciable numbers. The truth of continuity was proven by existence itself. For Leibniz the principle of continuity and thus the validity of his calculus was assured. Three hundred years after Leibniz&#x27;s work, Abraham Robinson showed that using infinitesimal quantities in calculus could be given a solid foundation.

===Legacy===
The rise of calculus stands out as a unique moment in mathematics. Calculus is the mathematics of motion and change, and as such, its invention required the creation of a new mathematical system. Importantly, Newton and Leibniz did not create the same calculus and they did not conceive of modern calculus. While they were both involved in the process of creating a mathematical system to deal with variable quantities their elementary base was different. For Newton, change was a variable quantity over time and for Leibniz it was the difference ranging over a sequence of infinitely close values. Notably, the descriptive terms each system created to describe change was different. 

Historically, there was much debate over whether it was Newton or Leibniz who first &quot;invented&quot; calculus. This argument, the Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy, involving Leibniz, who was German, and the Englishman Newton, led to a rift in the European mathematical community lasting over a century. Leibniz was the first to publish his investigations; however, it is well established that Newton had started his work several years prior to Leibniz and had already developed a theory of tangents by the time Leibniz became interested in the question.
It is not known how much this may have influenced Leibniz. The initial accusations were made by students and supporters of the two great scientists at the turn of the century, but after 1711 both of them became personally involved, accusing each other of plagiarism.

The priority dispute had an effect of separating English-speaking mathematicians from those in continental Europe for many years. Only in the 1820s, due to the efforts of the Analytical Society, did Leibnizian analytical calculus become accepted in England. Today, both Newton and Leibniz are given credit for independently developing the basics of calculus. It is Leibniz, however, who is credited with giving the new discipline the name it is known by today: &quot;calculus&quot;. Newton&#x27;s name for it was &quot;the science of fluents and fluxions&quot;.

While neither of the two offered convincing logical foundations for their calculus according to mathematician Carl B. Boyer, Newton came the closest, with his best attempt coming in &quot;Principia&quot;, where he described his idea of &quot;prime and ultimate ratios&quot; and came extraordinarily close to the limit, and his ratio of velocities corresponded to a single real number, which would not be fully defined until the late nineteenth century. On the other hand, the calculus of Leibniz was from a &quot;logical point of view, distinctly inferior to that of Newton, for it never transcended the view of formula_15 as a quotient of infinitely small changes or differences in &quot;y&quot; and &quot;x&quot;.&quot; However, heuristically, it was a success, despite being a &quot;failure&quot; from a logical point of view.

The work of both Newton and Leibniz is reflected in the notation used today. Newton introduced the notation formula_16 for the derivative of a function &quot;f&quot;. Leibniz introduced the symbol formula_17 for the integral and wrote the derivative of a function &quot;y&quot; of the variable &quot;x&quot; as formula_15, both of which are still in use.

Since the time of Leibniz and Newton, many mathematicians have contributed to the continuing development of calculus. One of the first and most complete works on both infinitesimal and integral calculus was written in 1748 by Maria Gaetana Agnesi.
==Developments==

===Calculus of variations===
The calculus of variations began with the work of Isaac Newton, such as with Newton&#x27;s minimal resistance problem, which Newton formulated and solved in 1685, and later published in his &quot;Principia&quot; in 1687, and which was the first problem in the field to be formulated and correctly solved, and was one of the most difficult problems tackled by variational methods prior to the twentieth century. It was followed by the brachistochrone curve problem of Johann Bernoulli (1696), which Bernoulli solved, using the principle of least time, but not the calculus of variations, whereas Newton did to solve it in 1697, thus he pioneered the field with his work on the two problems. The problem was similar to one raised by Galileo Galilei in 1638, but he did not solve the problem explicity nor did he use the methods based on calculus. It immediately occupied the attention of Jakob Bernoulli but Leonhard Euler first elaborated the subject. His contributions began in 1733, and his &quot;Elementa Calculi Variationum&quot; gave to the science its name. Joseph Louis Lagrange contributed extensively to the theory, and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1786) laid down a method, not entirely satisfactory, for the discrimination of maxima and minima. To this discrimination Brunacci (1810), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1829), Siméon Denis Poisson (1831), Mikhail Vasilievich Ostrogradsky (1834), and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1837) have been among the contributors. An important general work is that of Sarrus (1842) which was condensed and improved by Augustin Louis Cauchy (1844). Other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by Strauch (1849), Jellett (1850), Otto Hesse (1857), Alfred Clebsch (1858), and Carll (1885), but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of Karl Weierstrass. His course on the theory may be asserted to be the first to place calculus on a firm and rigorous foundation.

===Operational methods===

Antoine Arbogast (1800) was the first to separate the symbol of operation from that of quantity in a differential equation. Francois-Joseph Servois (1814) seems to have been the first to give correct rules on the subject. Charles James Hargreave (1848) applied these methods in his memoir on differential equations, and George Boole freely employed them. Hermann Grassmann and Hermann Hankel made great use of the theory, the former in studying equations, the latter in his theory of complex numbers.

===Integrals===
Niels Henrik Abel seems to have been the first to consider in a general way the question as to what differential equations can be integrated in a finite form by the aid of ordinary functions, an investigation extended by Liouville. Cauchy early undertook the general theory of determining definite integrals, and the subject has been prominent during the 19th century. Frullani integrals, David Bierens de Haan&#x27;s work on the theory and his elaborate tables, Lejeune Dirichlet&#x27;s lectures embodied in Meyer&#x27;s treatise, and numerous memoirs of Legendre, Poisson, Plana, Raabe, Sohncke, Schlömilch, Elliott, Leudesdorf and Kronecker are among the noteworthy contributions.

Eulerian integrals were first studied by Euler and afterwards investigated by Legendre, by whom they were classed as Eulerian integrals of the first and second species, as follows:

:formula_19

:formula_20

although these were not the exact forms of Euler&#x27;s study.

If &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer:
:formula_21
but the integral converges for all positive real formula_22 and defines an analytic continuation of the factorial function to all of the complex plane except for poles at zero and the negative integers. To it Legendre assigned the symbol formula_23, and it is now called the gamma function. Besides being analytic over positive reals formula_24, formula_23 also enjoys the uniquely defining property that formula_26 is convex, which aesthetically justifies this analytic continuation of the factorial function over any other analytic continuation. To the subject Lejeune Dirichlet has contributed an important theorem (Liouville, 1839), which has been elaborated by Liouville, Catalan, Leslie Ellis, and others. Raabe (1843–44), Bauer (1859), and Gudermann (1845) have written about the evaluation of formula_27 and formula_28. Legendre&#x27;s great table appeared in 1816.

==Applications==
The application of the infinitesimal calculus to problems in physics and astronomy was contemporary with the origin of the science. All through the 18th century these applications were multiplied, until at its close Laplace and Lagrange had brought the whole range of the study of forces into the realm of analysis. To Lagrange (1773) we owe the introduction of the theory of the potential into dynamics, although the name &quot;potential function&quot; and the fundamental memoir of the subject are due to Green (1827, printed in 1828). The name &quot;potential&quot; is due to Gauss (1840), and the distinction between potential and potential function to Clausius. With its development are connected the names of Lejeune Dirichlet, Riemann, von Neumann, Heine, Kronecker, Lipschitz, Christoffel, Kirchhoff, Beltrami, and many of the leading physicists of the century.

It is impossible in this article to enter into the great variety of other applications of analysis to physical problems. Among them are the investigations of Euler on vibrating chords; Sophie Germain on elastic membranes; Poisson, Lamé, Saint-Venant, and Clebsch on the elasticity of three-dimensional bodies; Fourier on heat diffusion; Fresnel on light; Maxwell, Helmholtz, and Hertz on electricity; Hansen, Hill, and Gyldén on astronomy; Maxwell on spherical harmonics; Lord Rayleigh on acoustics; and the contributions of Lejeune Dirichlet, Weber, Kirchhoff, F. Neumann, Lord Kelvin, Clausius, Bjerknes, MacCullagh, and Fuhrmann to physics in general. The labors of Helmholtz should be especially mentioned, since he contributed to the theories of dynamics, electricity, etc., and brought his great analytical powers to bear on the fundamental axioms of mechanics as well as on those of pure mathematics.

Furthermore, infinitesimal calculus was introduced into the social sciences, starting with Neoclassical economics. Today, it is a valuable tool in mainstream economics.

<text>Mount Gerizim ( ; ; ; , or ) is one of two mountains in the immediate vicinity of the Palestinian city of Nablus and the biblical city of Shechem. It forms the southern side of the valley in which Nablus is situated, the northern side being formed by Mount Ebal. The mountain is one of the highest peaks in the West Bank and rises to above sea level, lower than Mount Ebal. The mountain is particularly steep on the northern side, is sparsely covered at the top with shrubbery, and lower down there is a spring with a high yield of fresh water. For the Samaritan people, most of whom live around it, Mount Gerizim is considered the holiest place on Earth.

The mountain is mentioned in the Bible as the place where, upon first entering the Promised Land after the Exodus, the Israelites performed ceremonies of blessings, as they had been instructed by Moses.

Mount Gerizim is sacred to the Samaritans, who regard it, rather than Jerusalem&#x27;s Temple Mount, as the location chosen by God for a holy temple. In Samaritan tradition, it is the oldest and most central mountain in the world, towering above the Great Flood and providing the first land for Noah’s disembarkation. It is the location where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac. A Samaritan Temple was located on Mount Gerizim from the 5th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. Jews, on the other hand, consider the location of the near-sacrifice to be Mount Moriah, traditionally identified by them with the Temple Mount. Mount Gerizim continues to be the centre of Samaritan religion, and Samaritans ascend it three times a year: at Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. Passover is still celebrated by the Samaritans with a lamb sacrifice on Mount Gerizim.

The Samaritan village of Kiryat Luza and an Israeli settlement, Har Brakha, are situated on the ridge of Mount Gerizim. During the First Intifada in 1987, many Samaritan families relocated from Nablus to Mount Gerizim to avoid the violence. Today, about half of the remaining Samaritans live in close proximity to Gerizim, mostly in the village of Kiryat Luza.

==Biblical account==
According to the Hebrew Bible, as related in Deuteronomy, when they first entered Canaan the Israelites celebrated the event with ceremonies of blessings and cursings: the ceremonies of blessings took place on Mount Gerizim, and the cursings on nearby Mount Ebal. The &quot;Pulpit Commentary&quot; suggests that these mountains were selected probably &quot;because they stand in the center of the Land both from north to south, and from east to west&quot;. A commentary in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges argues that &quot;the face of Gerizim, the mount of blessing, is the more fertile; the opposite face of Ebal, the mount of curse, much the more bare&quot;, but the &quot;Pulpit Commentary&quot; states that both Gerizim and Ebal are &quot;equally barren-looking, though neither is wholly destitute of culture and vegetation&quot;.

The Masoretic Text says that Moses had also commanded the Israelites to build an altar on Mount Ebal, constructed from natural (rather than cut) stones, to place stones there and whiten them with lime, to make sacrificial offerings on the altar, eat there, and write the Mosaic Law in stones there. The Samaritan Pentateuch, as well as an ancient manuscript of the biblical text found in Qumran, both bring the same excerpt as the Masoretic Text, with the only difference being the name &quot;Gerizim&quot;, instead of &quot;Ebal&quot;, therefore stating that Moses commanded the building of the altar on Mount Gerizim. Recent work on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which include the oldest surviving manuscripts of the biblical text, further supports the accuracy of the Samaritan Pentateuch&#x27;s designation of Mount Gerizim, rather than Mount Ebal, as the first location in the Promised Land where Moses commanded an altar to be built.

All versions of the biblical text then have Moses specifying how the Israelites should split between the two groups that were to pronounce blessings from Mount Gerizim and to pronounce curses from Mount Ebal. The tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin were to be sent to Gerizim, while those of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali were to remain on Ebal.

The altar to God is again mentioned in the Book of Joshua, when, after the Battle of Ai, Joshua builds an altar of unhewn stones, the Israelites make peace offerings on it, the law of Moses is written onto the stones, and the Israelites split into the two groups specified in Deuteronomy and pronounce blessings on Mount Gerizim and curses on Mount Ebal, as instructed in the law of Moses. Biblical scholars believe that the sources of the book of Joshua predate those of Deuteronomy, and hence the order to build the altar and make the inscriptions is likely based on these actions in the sources of Joshua, rather than the other way around, possibly to provide an origin explanation for the events narrated in Joshua.
When Joshua was old and dying, he gathered the people together at Shechem (present-day Nablus) and gave a farewell speech, and set up &quot;a stone as a witness&quot;, placing it &quot;next to the sanctuary of Yahweh, under the oak tree&quot;, which indicates that a sanctuary to God existed there.

Mount Gerizim was also the site of the first parable in the Bible. records how Jotham son of Gideon stands on the mountain to proclaim the parable of the trees who wanted to make the bramble king among them, an allusion to the people of Schechem who wanted to make the ungodly and treacherous Abimelech their king.

==History==
A Samaritan temple dedicated to Yahweh was built on Mount Gerizim during the 5th century . It existed contemporaneously with the Jewish Second Temple in Jerusalem. By that point, the Israelites were divided as &quot;Samaritans&quot; and &quot;Jews&quot;, both claiming descendance from the Biblical Israelites and preaching adherence to the Torah, but diverging on the holiest place on Earth to adore God: Mount Gerizim for the Samaritans, and Jerusalem for the Jews. 

An adjacent city was built by the Samaritans during the and became the cultural center for the Samaritans. Religious rivalry between Samaritans and Jews led to Mount Gerizim being destroyed by the latter in on orders of John Hyrcanus.
Even after the destruction of their temple by the Jews, Mount Gerizim continued to be the holy place for the Samaritans, as mentioned in the New Testament. Coins produced by a Roman mint situated in Nablus, dated to seemingly depict the destroyed Samaritan temple, showing a huge temple complex, statues, and a substantive staircase leading from Nablus to the temple.

In the Gospel of John in the New Testament, in his discussion with the Samaritan woman at the well, Jesus reveals his feeling about worshipping in either Mount Gerizim (as the Samaritans did) or Jerusalem (as the Jews then did):
In unrest flared in Samaria when a charismatic figure rallied Samaritans to Mount Gerizim, claiming to unearth sacred vessels buried by Moses. Pontius Pilate, Roman governor of Judaea, alarmed by the growing assembly, deployed troops to block their ascent. This led to clashes, fatalities, and arrests, prompting Samaritan leaders to accuse Pilate of brutality. In response, Vitellius, the legate of Syria, appointed Marcellus to govern Judaea and recalled Pilate to Rome for investigation by Emperor Tiberius, who died before Pilate&#x27;s arrival.

In the summer of during the First Jewish–Roman War, a large group of Samaritans gathered on Mount Gerizim. Vespasian dispatched Cerialis, who commanded Legio V Macedonica, with a small force of 600 cavalry and 3,000 infantry, probably banking on the Samaritans&#x27; lack of defenses and summer water shortages. While some surrendered upon the Romans&#x27; arrival, the majority chose to fight. The conflict resulted in significant Samaritan casualties, totaling 11,600, according to Josephus.

Eventually, when Christianity became the state church of the Roman Empire, Samaritans were barred from worshiping on Mount Gerizim. In a Christian church was built on its summit. In 484, during the reign of Emperor Zeno, a martyrium-type octagonal church dedicated to the Theotokos (the God-bearing Virgin Mary) was erected at the site. In 529, Justinian I made Samaritanism illegal and arranged for a protective wall to be constructed around the church. As a result, the same year, Julianus ben Sabar led a pro-Samaritan revolt and by 530 had captured most of Samaria, destroying churches and killing the priests and officials. However, in 531, after Justinian enlisted the help of Ghassanids, the revolt was completely quashed, and surviving Samaritans were mostly enslaved or exiled. In 533 Justinian had a castle constructed on Mount Gerizim to protect the church from raids by the few disgruntled Samaritans left in the area.

According to Abu&#x27;l-Fath, &quot;Continuatio of the Samaritan Chronicle&quot;, during Sukkot in the seventh year of Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s reign (855), the governor of Nablus forbade Samaritans from praying aloud and blowing the shofar. However, the following Thursday, they ascended the mountain and prayed loudly without interruption.

==Archaeology==

Excavations at the site were initiated in 1983 and continued until 2006, and yielded tens of thousands of finds. Remnants found there identified that a Samaritan temple existed atop Mount Gerizim by the and that it was destroyed and rebuilt in the early only to be destroyed again in by Jewish forces. The archeological finds have shown that the precincts of the Samaritan temple, not including its gates, measured Inside the perimeter, thousands of pottery vessels and burned bones of animal sacrifices were found – sheep, goats, cattle, and doves – as well as many stones with inscriptions containing the Tetragrammaton (the name of God).

In a Christian church was built on the Mount&#x27;s summit. As a result of the fortified church and the previous Samaritan temple, extensive ruins still exist at the somewhat plateau-like top of Gerizim. The line of the wall around the church can easily be seen, as can portions of the former castle, and initial archaeological study of the site postulated that the castle built by Justinian had used stones from an earlier structure on the site, probably the Samaritan temple. In the centre of the plateau is a smooth surface, containing a hollow.

The excavation, initiated when the site was in the possession of Jordan and continued under Israeli rule, uncovered Corinthian columns, a large rectangular platform 65 m × 44 m (215 ft × 145 ft) surrounded by walls 2 m thick (6 ft) and 9 m high (30 ft), and a staircase 8 m wide (25 ft) leading down from the platform to a marbled esplanade. The complex also has a series of cisterns in which ceramics dated to the late Roman period were found. These discoveries are now called &quot;structure A&quot;, and have been dated to the time of Hadrian from excavated coins and external literary evidence. Underneath these remains were found a large stone structure built on top of the bedrock. This structure, now known as &quot;structure B&quot;, is nearly half of a cube (21 m × 20 m in width and length, and 8.5 m high). It has no internal rooms or dividing walls and consists almost entirely of uncut limestone slabs fitted together without any mortar. Structure B was surrounded by a courtyard (60 m × 40 m, with 1.5 m thick walls) similar to the platform above it, and was dated to during or before the Hellenistic period, from ceramics found in a cistern cut into the bedrock at the northern side. The excavating archaeologist considered &quot;structure B&quot; to be the altar built by the Samaritans in the 5th or 

== Etymology ==
It is possible that the name of the mountain may mean &quot;mountain of the Gerizites&quot;, a tribe in the vicinity of the Philistines that, according to the Hebrew Bible, was conquered by David. Another possible meaning is &quot;mountain cut in two&quot;.

According to the narrative about Jotham in the Book of Judges, Shechem was a site where there was a sanctuary of &quot;El-Berith&quot;, also known as Baal Berith, meaning &quot;God of the covenant&quot; and &quot;Lord of the covenant&quot;, respectively; scholars have suggested that the Joshua story about the site derives from a covenant made there in Canaanite times. In the narrative of Judges, the &quot;pillar that was in Shechem&quot; is seemingly significant enough to have given its name to a nearby plain (), and this pillar is thought to be likely to have been a baetylus of El-Berith; the Joshua story, of a stone being set up as a witness, simply being an attempt to provide an etiology in accordance with later Israelite theology.

The case was known as the &quot;Nasik Conspiracy Case - 1910&quot;. In the court trial in Bombay, police alleged Savarkar was the brain, moving spirit and inspiration of the conspiracy extending over many years. Bombay court sentenced him to life imprisonment, and transportation to notorious Cellular Jail at the Andaman Islands; Savarkar&#x27;s elder brother Babarao Savarkar also received the same punishment and others received varying degrees of imprisonment. ICS officer Jackson&#x27;s assassination created a sensation in Poona, Nasik and Bombay, the case and subsequently imprisonment made Savarkar famous.
