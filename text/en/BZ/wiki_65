<text>Martin Petyov Petrov (; born 15 January 1979) is a Bulgarian former professional footballer who played as a winger, most notably for VFL Wolfsburg, Atletico Madrid, Manchester City, and Bolton Wanderers. He also played 90 times for Bulgaria. 

==Club career==
Petrov began his career for Botev Vratsa. After a few good seasons, he signed with CSKA Sofia and after two successful games against Servette in the UEFA Cup, the Swiss side bought the 19-year-old for 1.2 million German marks.

===VfL Wolfsburg===
In 2001 Petrov moved to VfL Wolfsburg, where he established himself as an explosive player. He made his competitive debut on 14 July 2001 in a 4–3 home win over Dinamo Minsk in the Intertoto Cup, scoring a goal and laying on an assist. Petrov made his league debut for Wolfsburg on the opening day of the 2001–02 Bundesliga season, in a 2–1 away loss against Bayer 04 Leverkusen on 28 July. In his first season at Wolfsburg, Petrov earned 32 appearances in the Bundesliga, scored 6 goals and provided 11 assists.

On 30 October 2004, Petrov scored all four goals in Wolfsburg&#x27;s 4–3 win over Mainz 05. He made 30 appearances during the 2004–05 season finishing as the club&#x27;s top scorer with 12 goals. He also made 14 assists.

===Atlético Madrid===
In summer 2005, Petrov was bought by Atlético Madrid for a fee of €10 million.

On 14 October 2006, Petrov suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury during a game against Recreativo de Huelva and was sidelined for more than six months. He made his comeback for Atlético from a serious knee injury on 28 April 2007, playing for 56 minutes in a 0–0 draw against Real Betis. On 6 May, Petrov netted Atlético&#x27;s only goal in their 2–1 defeat at Espanyol.

On 24 July 2007, after constant press speculation about him leaving the club, it was reported that Atlético Madrid had placed a £6.2 million price on the player. Later that day, he left the Atlético Madrid training camp to think over his future with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City reputedly interested in the player. On 25 July, reports in the Spanish press suggested that Petrov had already agreed terms and had medical tests with Manchester City and that only minor details needed completing before finalising a move to Eastlands. Manchester City confirmed the £4.7 million (€7 million) move on a three-year contract on 26 July 2007.

===Manchester City===
His first Premier League game was on 11 August 2007 when he started in Manchester City&#x27;s 2–0 win over West Ham United at Upton Park. His first goals came on 22 September 2007 against Fulham. After that Petrov scored two goals, one in the 3–1 win over Newcastle United the other one in the 2–1 win over Reading and also notched up six assists. He was sent off by referee Rob Styles in the home loss to Everton, for kicking Leon Osman. The challenge earned him a straight red card which banned him for three games. Petrov added to his tally with a goal against Portsmouth.

Following the influx of new players at Manchester City such as Carlos Tevez and Emmanuel Adebayor, Petrov was linked with a move away from the City of Manchester Stadium. He was often in and out of the first team. However, he scored goals in the first two games that he had started, prompting Hughes to start Petrov in place of Shaun Wright-Phillips at home against Fulham. Though he scored, he also aggravated the knee injury that had plagued him. After the sacking of Mark Hughes and arrival of Roberto Mancini, he started both league games and scored in the 2–0 win over Stoke City on 26 December. He also publicly expressed his anger against Hughes as Petrov was frequently moved in and out of the starting 11.

On 18 April 2010, Petrov announced that his season was over and that he would miss the four remaining Premier League games due to a knee injury.

On 8 June 2010, it was announced that Petrov&#x27;s contract had expired and that he would be leaving the club, along with Benjani Mwaruwari, Karl Moore and Sylvinho.

===Bolton Wanderers===
On 22 June 2010, it was announced that Petrov had agreed terms with Bolton Wanderers, and the free transfer was completed when the transfer window opened on 1 July. He scored his first goal for the club against Manchester United on 26 September 2010, and finished the season with three goals. His 2nd season saw him score six goals, four in the League, one in the League Cup and one in the FA Cup as Bolton were relegated from the Premier League. At the end of the season, Petrov had played enough matches (needed 30 played 35) to activate a clause in his contract, extending his contract for another season.

===Espanyol===
Petrov signed for La Liga side RCD Espanyol for the remainder of the 2012–13 season on 14 January 2013. He struggled to establish himself as part of the first team and left the club at the end of the season. He subsequently joined the Manchester Saturday league to keep in shape.

===CSKA Sofia===
After 15 years abroad Petrov made his return to CSKA Sofia in October 2013. On 31 October 2013, Petrov made his return debut for the &quot;armymen&quot; after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 1–0 home win over Beroe in an A Group match. He played for the first time as a starter on 16 November, in the 0–0 draw with Levski Sofia in a Bulgarian Cup game. His first goal came in the 3–1 away win over PFC Neftochimic Burgas on 25 November. Petrov participated in his last match as a professional footballer on 17 May 2014, in the 1–1 draw against Lokomotiv Plovdiv, which was part of the last round of the 2013–14 A Group season.

==International career==

In June 1999, he received his first call-up to the Bulgarian national team for a Euro 2000 qualifier against England. He came as a substitute to play alongside his idol Hristo Stoichkov. However, it proved to be an inauspicious start to his international career; he was sent off for a second yellow card just eight minutes after coming on as a substitute. Petrov cried while he was leaving the pitch.

Petrov was the key player in Bulgaria&#x27;s unsuccessful Euro 2004 participation, excelling in all three games and scoring Bulgaria&#x27;s only goal at the finals; a penalty against Italy in Bulgaria&#x27;s 1–2 loss.

On 2 September 2006, Petrov played a crucial role in the Bulgarian national team&#x27;s Euro 2008 opening qualifying game against Romania in Constanţa, nailing two goals in two minutes to equalize from 2–0 in the last minutes of the game. This was seen as a remarkable comeback. He also went on to score against Slovenia (in a 3–0 win) and the Netherlands (in a 1–1 draw). His performances in the 2006 qualifying campaign earned him the 2006 Bulgarian Footballer of the Year award.
On 7 September 2010, Petrov earned his 80th cap for Bulgaria in the 0–1 home loss in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro.

<text>Rebbetzin Bruria David (; 1938 – April 9, 2023 (19 Nissan 5783)) was an American-born Israeli Haredi Jewish rebbetzin and Torah scholar. She was the founder and dean of Beth Jacob Jerusalem (commonly known as BJJ), a prestigious Haredi religious girls seminary located in the Unsdorf neighborhood of Jerusalem, Israel. She was the only child of Rabbi Yitzchak Hutner (1906–1980), Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, and the wife of Rabbi Yonasan David, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva Pachad Yitzchok in Jerusalem&#x27;s Har Nof neighborhood. Together with her husband and parents, she was on one of the airplanes hijacked by the Black September terrorists in 1970.

==Early life and education==

Bruria David was born in 1938, the daughter of Rabbi Yitzchak Hutner and Masha Lipshitz. Her parents married in 1933 and moved to Mandatory Palestine, but they returned to New York a year later, where Bruria was born.

Rebbetzin David received her doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University in 1971 as a student of Salo Baron. Her dissertation, titled &quot;The Dual Role of Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes: Traditionalist and Maskil&quot;, deals with Rabbi Chajes&#x27;s relationships in the traditional world of Orthodox Judaism as well as insights into his worldview and beliefs based on his publications, halachic writings, and personal correspondence.

==BJJ==

Rebbetzin David founded Beth Jacob Jerusalem (BJJ), also known as Machon Sarah Shneirer, in the early 1970s as a post-secondary seminary in Israel, which is geared for American and European graduates of Bais Yaakov who wish to pursue Torah study on an advanced academic level. Previously, she had a seminary at Esther Schonfeld on the East Side and then at Bais Yaakov Academy. The seminary also provides professional training towards a teaching degree. David personally interviewed most applicants, with the exception of those who opted for a written entrance exam instead of an interview.

==Black September hijacking==

In 1970, Rebbetzin David and her husband accompanied her parents on a trip to Israel. During the return flight to New York on 6 September 1970, their plane was hijacked by the PFLP Palestinian terrorist organization. The terrorists freed the non-Jewish passengers and held the Jewish passengers hostage on the plane for one week, after which the women and children – including David and her mother – were released and sent to Cyprus. The hijacked airplanes were subsequently detonated. The remaining 40-plus Jewish men – including Rabbi Hutner and Rebbetzin David, and two students accompanying Hutner, Rabbi Meir Fund and Rabbi Yaakov Drillman – and male flight crew continued to be held hostage in and around Amman, Jordan; Hutner was held alone in an isolated location while Jews around the world prayed for his safe return. Rabbi Hutner and Rebbetzin David were finally released on 26 September and flown to Nicosia, Cyprus. On 28 September Hutner, David, their wives and students were flown back to New York via Europe, and were home in time for the first night of Rosh Hashana.

==Scholarship==
Together with her husband, Yonasan David, Bruria edited the works of her father, entitled &quot;Pachad Yitzchok&quot; ( Isaac&#x27;s Fear). The couple also compiled and published the official biography of Hutner, entitled &quot;Sefer HaZikaron&quot; (Book of Remembrance).

==Death==
Rebbetzin Bruria David died on April 9, 2023, at the age of 84.

<text>James Henderson Duff (January 21, 1883 – December 20, 1969) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served as United States Senator from Pennsylvania from 1951 to 1957. Previously he had served as the 34th governor of Pennsylvania from 1947 to 1951.

==Early life and education==
James Duff was born in Mansfield (now Carnegie), a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The oldest of four children, he was the son of Rev. Joseph Miller and Margaret (née Morgan) Duff. His father was a Presbyterian minister for forty years, and his paternal grandfather was the first college-educated doctor in western Pennsylvania. Two of his great-grandfathers were members of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania between 1683 and 1717.

After graduating at the top of his class at Carnegie High School, Duff attended Princeton University in New Jersey, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1904. Originally he had intended to study medicine but, after winning two medals in public speaking at Princeton, decided to study law instead. He attended the University of Pennsylvania Law School in Philadelphia until 1906, when he transferred to the University of Pittsburgh Law School to be closer to home. In 1907, he received his law degree and was admitted to the bar. He married Jean Kerr Taylor in 1909; the couple had only one child who died in infancy, but they raised a nephew after the boy&#x27;s father died.

==Early career==
Duff practiced law in Pittsburgh for thirty-six years, establishing the law firm of Duff, Scott and Smith. He also served as solicitor of Carnegie, and was an elector for Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 presidential election. In addition to practicing law, Duff was engaged in the oil business for several years. He began by buying an oil driller&#x27;s rig and taking a lease on some property about five miles from his home, where he struck oil. He subsequently engaged in ventures in other parts of western Pennsylvania as well as Mexico. He also served as president of the Criterion Oil Company and of the Westmoreland Natural Gas Company. He lost his fortune in the 1929 stock market crash, taking several years to recover financially. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1932, 1936, and 1940.

==Political career==
Duff was appointed Attorney General of Pennsylvania by Governor Edward Martin in 1943, serving in that position until 1947. During his tenure, he worked to strengthen the state&#x27;s stream pollution law despite facing strong opposition from the coal industry. He also fought against the mining industry after promoting legislation to prevent the discharge of mine silt into the Schuylkill River. The Desilting Act and Clean Streams Act (also known as the Brunner Act) were passed in 1945 under Duff&#x27;s tenure as Attorney General.
In 1946, John Bell, who had been elected Lieutenant Governor in 1942 and had ascended to the governorship following Martin&#x27;s resignation for the US senate, declined to be a candidate in the upcoming 1946 gubernatorial election. Duff subsequently won the Republican nomination, and was elected the 34th Governor of Pennsylvania in the general election. His campaign focused on the issues of conservation, public health, and education. He handily defeated his Democratic opponent, former President pro tempore of the State Senate John Rice, by more than 557,000 votes.

Duff was elected to the United States Senate from Pennsylvania in 1950, narrowly unseating Democratic Senator Francis J. Myers. After losing the 1956 election to Democrat Joe Clark in one of the closest elections in Pennsylvania history, Duff retired from politics, but remained in Washington, D.C., as a partner in the law firm of Davies, Richberg, Tydings, Landa &amp; Duff. He died in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Carnegie, Pennsylvania.

<text>Olof Mattias Jonsson (; born 16 January 1974) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a winger. Starting off his career with Örebro SK in the early 1990s, he went on to represent Helsingborgs IF, Brøndby IF, and Norwich City before retiring at Djurgårdens IF in 2011. A full international between 1996 and 2006, he won 57 caps and scored nine goals for the Sweden national team. He represented his country at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2004, and the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

== Club career ==

=== Early career ===
Born in Kumla, Jonson started playing youth football with IFK Kumla and Karlslunds IF. He moved to Örebro SK in 1992, where he got his senior debut in the top-flight Allsvenskan championship. He moved to league rivals Helsingborgs IF in 1996. He won the 1999 Allsvenskan championship with Helsingborg, before leaving the club at the end of the 1999 season.

=== Brøndby IF ===
Jonson moved abroad to join Danish club Brøndby IF in the Danish Superliga championship. He was brought in by Brøndby&#x27;s new manager Åge Hareide, and Jonson played several games as a striker, before settling as a left-sided winger. He showed his goalscoring abilities for Brøndby on a number of occasions. In the 2001–02 UEFA Cup tournament, Brøndby had lost 3–1 away to Croatian club NK Varteks. In the return game, Jonson scored a hat-trick which guided Brøndby to a 5–0 victory and advancement in the tournament, on a 6–3 aggregate. Jonson also scored a hat-trick in an April 2002 Superliga game, when Brøndby won 5–0 against Akademisk Boldklub, and helped the club win the 2001–02 Superliga championship.

He was Brøndby&#x27;s league topscorer with 11 goals in the 2002–03 Superliga season, and helped the club win the 2003 Danish Cup trophy.

=== Norwich City ===
After the 2004 European Championship, Jonson looked to leave Brøndby. In August 2004, he moved to England and joined the newly promoted Premier League side Norwich City. He transferred from Brøndby for an undisclosed fee, which was believed to be around £850,000. He struggled to make an impact in the Premier League, and left Norwich after one season.

=== Return to Sweden ===
In 2005, he returned to Sweden to play for Djurgårdens IF. In his first season with the club, he helped Djurgårdens IF win the Double of both the 2005 Allsvenskan and Svenska Cupen trophies. He started the tournament as a substitute, but was included in Sweden&#x27;s starting line-up for the final two games before elimination. He ended his national team career in August 2006. Jonson ended his career after the 2011 season, and played his last game on 23 October 2011.

== International career ==
Jonson made his Sweden national team debut in February 1996. He was included in the Sweden national team for the 2002 World Cup, where he took part in two games as a substitute, before Sweden were eliminated.

He was called up in the Sweden national team for the 2004 European Championship. He started the tournament on the bench, but was brought on as a substitute and eventually secured himself a place in the starting line-up. He played in three of Sweden&#x27;s four games, and scored a goal against Denmark, which secured Sweden advancement from the preliminary group stage.

He represented Sweden at the 2006 World Cup, where he took part in all Sweden&#x27;s four matches.

== Personal life ==
He is the father of the Djurgårdens IF player Melker Jonsson.

<doc id="744849" wikidata="Q707735" url="?curid=744849" title="Market fundamentalism">
<text>Market fundamentalism, also known as free-market fundamentalism, is a term applied to a strong belief in the ability of unregulated &quot;laissez-faire&quot; or free-market capitalist policies to solve most economic and social problems. It is often used as pejorative by critics of said beliefs.


== Origins and use ==
Palagummi Sainath believes Jeremy Seabrook, a journalist and campaigner, first used the term. The term was used by Jonathan Benthall in an &quot;Anthropology Today&quot; editorial in 1991 and by John Langmore and John Quiggin in their 1994 book &quot;Work for All&quot;.

According to economist John Quiggin, the standard features of economic fundamentalist rhetoric are dogmatic assertions combined with the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist. However, Kozul-Wright states in his book &quot;The Resistible Rise of Market Fundamentalism&quot; that the &quot;ineluctability of market forces&quot; neoliberals and conservative politicians tend to stress and their confidence on a chosen policy rest on a &quot;mixture of implicit and hidden assumptions, myths about the history of their own countries&#x27; economic development, and special interests camouflaged in their rhetoric of general good&quot;. The sociologists Fred L. Block and Margaret Somers use the label &quot;because the term conveys the quasi-religious certainty expressed by contemporary advocates of market self-regulation&quot;.

Joseph Stiglitz used the term in his autobiographical essay in acceptance of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences to criticize some International Monetary Fund policies, arguing: &quot;More broadly, the IMF was advocating a set of policies which is generally referred to alternatively as the Washington consensus, the neo-liberal doctrines, or market fundamentalism, based on an incorrect understanding of economic theory and (what I viewed) as an inadequate interpretation of the historical data&quot;.

Critics of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies have used the term to denote what they perceive as a misguided belief or deliberate deception that capitalist free markets provide the greatest possible equity and prosperity, or the view that any interference with the market process decreases social well-being. Users of the term include adherents of interventionist, mixed economy and protectionist positions as well as billionaires such as George Soros; economists such as Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman; and Cornell University historian Edward E. Baptist. Soros suggests that market fundamentalism includes the belief that the best interests in a given society are achieved by allowing its participants to pursue their own financial self-interest with no restraint or regulatory oversight.

Critics claim that in modern society with worldwide conglomerates, or even merely large companies, the individual has no protection against fraud nor harm caused by products that maximize income by imposing externalities on the individual consumer as well as society. Historian Edward E. Baptist contends that &quot;unrestrained domination of market forces can sometimes amplify existing forms of oppression into something more horrific&quot; such as slavery and that &quot;market fundamentalism doesn&#x27;t always provide the best solution for every economic or social problem&quot;.

<text>Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon ( Austin; 24 June 1821 – 14 July 1869) was an English author and translator who wrote as Lucie Gordon. She is best known for her &quot;Letters from Egypt, 1863–1865&quot; (1865) and &quot;Last Letters from Egypt&quot; (1875), most of which are addressed to her husband, Alexander Duff-Gordon, and her mother, Sarah Austin. Having moved in prominent literary circles in London, she contracted tuberculosis and travelled in 1861 to South Africa for health reasons. She travelled on to Egypt in 1862 where she settled in Luxor, learnt Arabic, and wrote many letters about Egyptian culture, religion, and customs. Her letters are notable for humour, outrage at the ruling Ottomans, and many personal stories from the people around her.

==Early life==

Lucie Austin was born on 24 June 1821, in Queen Square, Westminster, to John Austin (1790–1859), a jurist, and his wife, Sarah Austin, a translator. Lucie&#x27;s father was a professor of jurisprudence and a noted intellectual while her mother was well educated for a woman of the time, used to discussing politics on an equal footing with men.

Her parents&#x27; only child, her chief playfellows were her first cousin Henry Reeve, and the teenage John Stuart Mill. Inheriting her parents&#x27; talents Lucie developed a strong love of reading and as she grew in vigour and in sense, she developed a strong tinge of originality and independence, with a marked love of animals. Her childhood included the elderly Jeremy Bentham (who had founded Utilitarianism) take her around his garden in an activity they called &quot;ante-prandial circumgyration&quot;.

In 1826 she went with her parents to Bonn on the Rhine, and stayed sufficiently long enough to return speaking fluent German. She had scant regular instruction, but was for a short time at a mixed school of boys and girls kept by George Edward Biber at Hampstead, where she learnt Latin.

By the age of 13 she was reading the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in the original. She also kept her pet snake twined into her plaited hair, and was thought to be &quot;un peu unmanageable&quot; by her mother and &quot;a potential homicide&quot; by a friend of the family. Following the breakdown of her father&#x27;s health, which had always been delicate, the family moved to Boulogue-sur-Mer where they lived from 1834 to 1836. In 1836, her father was appointed as a Royal Commissioner to inquire into the grievances in Malta. While his wife accompanied him, the climate was considered too hot for a young girl so Lucie was sent to Miss Shepherd&#x27;s school at Bromley. Her parents were Unitarians, but at the age of 16 Lucie insisted on being baptised and confirmed as a member of the Church of England. As a girl she made the acquaintance of Heinrich Heine. Lord Houghton&#x27;s &quot;Monographs Personal and Social&quot;, 1873, pp.323–32 contains an affecting narrative of her visits to the poet in Paris in 1854 shortly before his death.

==Marriage==
Upon her parents&#x27; return to England in 1838, Lucie attended her first society ball, held at Lansdowne House, the London home of the Marquess of Lansdowne. Here she sighted the handsome Sir Alexander Cornewall Duff-Gordon, 3rd Baronet, of Halkin, who was ten years her senior. As her father descended into melancholy and self-doubt, her mother took on work as a translator, writing for various periodicals and as a teacher to support the family. Lucie was allowed to meet and walk out alone with Duff-Gordon. One day he said to her: &quot;Miss Austin, do you know people say we are going to be married?&quot;. Annoyed at being talked of, and hurt at his brusque way of mentioning it, she was just going to give a sharp answer, when he added: &quot;Shall we make it true?&quot; to which she replied with the monosyllable &quot;Yes&quot;. The couple were married on 16 May 1840 in Kensington Old Church, despite the initial objections by the groom&#x27;s mother over Lucie&#x27;s lack of a dowry .

Following her marriage at the age of 18, Lucie, Lady Duff-Gordon continued with translating and various other writing projects.

The couple lived at 8 Queen Square, Westminster, a house with a statue of Queen Anne at one end, since renumbered as 15 Queen Anne&#x27;s Gate. Here a remarkable circle of friends and acquaintances often met. Lord Lansdowne, Lord Monteagle, Caroline Norton, Dickens, Thackeray, Elliot Warburton, Tom Taylor, Tennyson, Alexander Kinglake, and Henry Taylor were habitués, and every foreigner of talent and renown looked upon the house as a centre of interest. On one occasion Leopold von Ranke was among the visitors.

A noted character in the establishment in Queen Square was a Nubian boy called Hassan el Bakkeet, who had been enslaved before being rescued by English missionaries. He had then obtained a position as a servant but after he was threatened with blindness his employer had sacked him. As he had occasionally delivered messages to Queen Square, he found his way, as he explained, &#x27;to die on the threshold of the beautiful pale lady.&#x27; He was found crouching on Lady Duff-Gordon&#x27;s doorstep one night, when she was returning from a theatrical party at Charles Dickens&#x27;s home. She took el Bakkeet in, had his eyes treated and his condition cured. He became known as Hatty, and was employed as Lady Duff-Gordon&#x27;s devoted servant and well known to visitors. He was also a playmate to her daughter Janet, to the horror of a visiting American author, a Mr. Hilliard, who asked Lady Duff-Gordon how she could let a negro touch her child, whereupon she called Janet and Hatty to her, and kissed each of them. Hatty contracted consumption and died in the Westminster Hospital in 1850.

As her parents had settled in Weybridge the Duff-Gordons spent some summers with them. The house was cold and damp, which lead Janet Duff- Gordon to attribute her mother&#x27;s later bad health to the incessant colds she caught there. While living at Weybridge in 1850 Lady Duff-Gordon established and superintended a working-men&#x27;s library and reading-room. Following the birth of her son Maurice in 1849, Lady Duff-Gordon began to succumb to tuberculosis and by the winter of 1861 she had become so ill that her doctors advised her to travel to a warmer, drier climate. After trying Ventnor for two winters, she went on a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope in 1860. An account of this appeared in Francis Galton&#x27;s &quot;Vacation Tourist&quot;, 1862–63, pp.119–222, under the title &quot;Letters from the Cape&quot;.

==Egypt==
Upon her return to England, she was persuaded to go to Eaux Bonnes in the autumn of 1862, which negatively affected her health. Lady Duff-Gordon then decided to visit the newly fashionable Egypt, leaving her husband and children behind in England. While she was familiar with the country from reading Herodotus, the Bible, Arabian Nights and Alexander William Kinglake&#x27;s &quot;Eothan,&quot; they hadn&#x27;t prepared her for the realities of modern Egypt when she disembarked in Alexandria in October 1862.

She noted &quot;what is not pleasant is the absence of all brightness or gaiety, even from young and childish faces.&quot; Despite this she made Egypt her home for the rest of her life with the exception of two short visits to England in 1863 and 1865. Open to other cultures and a supporter of working-class politics in the United Kingdom, Lady Duff-Gordon&#x27;s sympathies were with the hard-working fellahin (peasantry) of Egypt. During the first years of her residence on the Nile she wrote numerous letters to her family, in which she gave vivid descriptions of Eastern life and many details of domestic manners and customs. These were collected and edited by her mother Sarah Austin and published as &quot;Letters from Egypt, 1863–1865&quot; in May 1865 to provide money to support her in exile. The publication was the first really intimate picture written by a European of a country that was in vogue in the West. The image it created of her heroic struggle with consumption while far from home captured the imagination of the reading public. In many of her letters she made frequent scathing remarks about the British abroad and the Egyptian government. The book was so popular that the book went through three editions in its first year of publication. As a result of her literary fame, many British travellers passing through Luxor made a point of calling on her, including the writer Edward Lear in January 1867 and the Prince and Princess of Wales in February 1869. She found the city more to her liking describing it as &quot;a golden existence, all sunshine and poetry, and I must add kindness and civility.&quot;
Hiring a servant Omar, who was known by his nickname Abu Halawy (&quot;father of sweets&quot;) Lady Duff-Gordon proceeded upstream. After 10 days on the Nile she observed that she was sleeping and eating better and coughing less. By the time the boat reached Asyut after three weeks of travel, she was in love with Egypt despite having no interest in country&#x27;s ancient monuments. Lady Duff-Gordon returned to England in June 1863 but her health continued to fail and so both for its sake and because of her enthrallment with the country, she returned to Egypt in October of the same year. As it was by then winter she found that Cairo was too cold and damp, so relocated to Luxor. She was able to persuade the French consul to allow her to take up residence in Luxor what was called &quot;The French House&quot;, a large ramshackle building located on top of the dirt and debris that covered Luxor Temple right up to its roof. She described it in a letter to her husband in 1864 as &quot;The view all round my house is magnificent on every side, over the Nile in front facing north-west and over a splendid range of green and distant orange buff hills to the south-east, where I have a spacious covered terrace.&quot;

On a journey down the Nile in 1865 she nearly died of pleurisy and was nursed back to health by her servant Omar.

Throughout her long stay in Egypt she won golden opinions from the local people. Her unvarying kindness, her attention to the sick, her charm, and her sympathy with the oppressed, endeared her to the people, to whom she was known as &quot;Noor ala Noor&quot; (light from the light) and &quot;Sitt el Kebeer&quot; (Great Lady), who &quot;was just and had a heart that loved the Arabs&quot;. During an epidemic in the spring of 1864 Egyptians preferred to rather than the government clinics. She also gained a reputation for having a &quot;lucky eye&quot; and thus being regarded as a bringer of good luck was called upon for numerous flavours including visiting houses under construction, inspecting cattle and young brides.
She was outspoken about the profligacy of Egypt&#x27;s ruler Ismail, who made an attempt to bribe a boatman to drown her, but her popularity saved her. Some of her letters were intercepted by the Government and never delivered. One of her original donkey boys was Muhammad Mohassib, who later would become a well-known antiquities dealer in Luxor.

In December 1867, six days prior to her return from a trip away, part of the French House collapsed following a flood into the temple below.

==Death==
Lady Duff-Gordon&#x27;s condition worsened in early 1869 forcing her to move, in search of better terminal care, to the spa resort of Helwan, just south of Cairo where she died on 13 July 1869, aged 48. She was buried in the English cemetery there. Her husband died in London on 27 October 1872 aged 61.

==Personal life==
She and Duff-Gordon had four children. Their daughter Janet Ann Ross was born in 1842 and died in 1927. Their second child was born in 1849 but died after only a few months of life. Their third child Maurice (1849–1896) became Sir Maurice Duff-Gordon, 4th Baronet. Their fourth child Urania Duff-Gordon was born in 1858 and died on 22 September 1877.

Sir Maurice&#x27;s daughter Caroline &quot;Lina&quot; (1874–1964) became an author and foreign correspondent for &quot;The Observer&quot;; she was the mother of author Gordon Waterfield and grandmother of the historian Sir Antony Beevor.

==Works==
Lucie Austin commenced her literary life with translations, her earliest work being Barthold Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;Studies of Ancient Grecian Mythology&quot;, which was published in 1839 under her mother&#x27;s name. In 1844 she translated Wilhelm Meinhold&#x27;s &quot;Mary Schweidler, the Amber Witch&quot;, a narrative dressed up as a 17th-century chronicle, and concocted to discredit rationalist methods of biblical criticism. In 1845 she published &quot;The French in Algiers, from the German and French of C. Lamping&quot;, and in 1846 &quot;Narrative of Remarkable Criminal Trials, by P. J. A. von Feuerbach&quot;.

In 1847 she and her husband Sir Alexander Duff-Gordon, translated &quot;Memoirs of the House of Brandenberg, by L. von Ranke&quot;.

She translated &quot;Stella and Vanessa&quot;, a romance by A. F. L. de Wailly, and in 1853 two other works: &quot;The Village Doctor&quot;, by the Countess d&#x27;Arbouville, and &quot;Ferdinand I and Maximilian II of Austria&quot;, by L. von Ranke. In 1854 she translated &quot;The Russians in Bulgaria and Roumelia, 1828–29&quot;, by Baron von Moltke. She edited &quot;The History and Literature of the Crusades&quot;, by H. C. L. von Sybel, in 1861.

===Letters from Egypt===
The first volume of Lady Duff-Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Letters from Egypt&quot; was published by Macmillan and Co. in May 1865, with a preface by her mother, Sarah Austin. This book is the best known and considered the most interesting of her productions. In 1875 a volume containing the &quot;Last Letters from Egypt&quot;, to which were added &quot;Letters from the Cape&quot;, reprinted from &quot;Vacation Tourists&quot; (1864), with a memoir of Lady Duff-Gordon by her daughter Janet Ross was published by Macmillan and Co. A second edition appeared in 1876. In 1902 a revised edition was published by R. Brimley Johnson with a memoir of Lady Duff-Gordon by her daughter Janet Ross and a new introduction by George Meredith. This had the letters as they were written, omitting only the purely family matter which her daughter deemed as of no interest to the public.

==In literature==
Lady Duff-Gordon is one of the characters in the novel &quot;The Mistress of Nothing&quot; by Kate Pullinger.

Lady Duff-Gordon&#x27;s daughter (Janet Ross) recalled, &quot;Tennyson told my mother that he had her in mind when he wrote &#x27;The Princess&#x27;. I don&#x27;t think she was as much flattered as many of his admirers would have been.&quot;

<text>Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, KCMG, PC (12 April 1816 – 9 February 1903), was an Irish poet and journalist (editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;), Young Irelander and tenant-rights activist. After emigrating to Australia in 1856 he entered the politics of Victoria on a platform of land reform, and in 1871–1872 served as the colony&#x27;s 8th Premier.

==Ireland==

===Early life and career===

Duffy was born at No. 10 Dublin Street in Monaghan Town, County Monaghan, Ireland, the son of a Catholic shopkeeper. He was educated in Belfast at St Malachy&#x27;s College and in the collegiate department of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution where he studied logic, rhetoric and &quot;belles-lettres&quot;.

One day, when Duffy was aged 18, Charles Hamilton Teeling, a United Irish veteran of the 1798 rising, walked into his mother&#x27;s house (his father had died when he was 10). Teeling was establishing a journal in Belfast and asked Duffy to accompany him on a round of calls to promote it in Monaghan. Inspired by Teeling&#x27;s recollections of &#x27;98, Duffy began contributing to the journal, &quot;The Northern Herald&quot;.

In Belfast, Duffy went on to edit &quot;The Vindicator&quot;, an O&#x27;Connellite journal launched by Thomas O&#x27;Hagan (later the first Catholic to become Lord Chancellor of Ireland since 1687). At the same time, he began studying law at the King&#x27;s Inns in Dublin.

Duffy was admitted to the Irish Bar in 1845. But before then he established himself in literary circles as the editor of &quot;Ballad Poetry of Ireland&quot; (1843), and in political circles as editor of a new Dublin weekly, &quot;The Nation&quot;.

===&quot;The Nation&quot;===

In 1842, Duffy co-founded &quot;The Nation&quot; with Thomas Osborne Davis, and John Blake Dillon. Contributors were notable for including nationally minded Protestants: in addition to Davis, Jane Wilde, Margaret Callan, John Mitchel, John Edward Pigot and William Smith O&#x27;Brien. All were members or supporters of Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Repeal Association, dedicated to a restoration of an Irish parliament through a reversal of the 1800 Acts of Union.

When he had first followed O&#x27;Connell, Duffy concedes that he had &quot;burned with the desire to set up again the Celtic race and the catholic church&quot;. But in &quot;The Nation&quot; (which repeatedly invoked memory of the United Irishmen) Duffy committed himself to a &quot;nationality&quot; that would embrace as easily &quot;the stranger who is within our gates&quot; as &quot;the Irishman of a hundred generations.&quot; This expansive, ecumenical, view of the opinion-forming tasks of the paper brought him into conflict with the clericalism of the broader movement.

===At issue with O&#x27;Connell===

O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s paper, &quot;The Pilot&quot;, did not hesitate to identify religion as the &quot;positive and unmistakable&quot; mark of distinction between Irish and English. As leader of the Catholic Association, O&#x27;Connell had fought to secure not only Catholic entry to Parliament but also the prerogatives and independence of the Catholic Church. It was, he maintained, &quot;a national Church&quot; and should the people &quot;rally&quot; to him, they would &quot;have a nation for that Church&quot;. O&#x27;Connell, at least privately, was of the view that &quot;Protestantism would not survive the Repeal ten years&quot;. He assured Dr Paul Cullen (the future Cardinal and Catholic Primate of Ireland) that once an Irish parliament had swept aside Ascendancy privilege, &quot;the great mass of the Protestant community would with little delay melt into the overwhelming majority of the Irish nation&quot;.

In 1845, the Dublin Castle administration proposed to educate Catholics and Protestants together in a non-denominational system of higher education. &quot;The Nation&quot; welcomed the proposition, but O&#x27;Connell, claiming that there had been &quot;unanimous and unequivocal condemnation&quot; from the bishops&quot;, opposed. Disregarding Thomas Davis&#x27;s plea that &quot;reasons for separate education are reasons for [a] separate life&quot;, and declaring himself content to take a stand &quot;for Old Ireland&quot;, O&#x27;Connell rejected the &quot;godless&quot; colleges.

For Duffy there was a further, less liberal basis, for his disaffection: O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s repeated denunciations of a &quot;vile union&quot; in the United States &quot;of republicanism and slavery&quot;, and his appeal to Irish Americans to join in the abolitionist struggle. Duffy believed the time was not right &quot;for gratuitous interference in American affairs&quot;. Not least because of the desire for American support and funding, it was a common view.

===Young Ireland===

Following Davis&#x27;s sudden death in 1845, Duffy appointed John Mitchel deputy editor. Against the background of increasingly violent peasant resistance to evictions and of the onset of famine, Mitchell brought a more militant tone. When the &quot;Standard&quot; in London observed that the new Irish railways could be used to transport troops to quickly curb agrarian unrest, Mitchel responded that the tracks could be turned into pikes and trains ambushed. O&#x27;Connell publicly distanced himself from the seditious import of the remarks—it appeared to some setting Duffy, as the publisher, up for prosecution. When the courts failed to convict, O&#x27;Connell pressed the issue, seemingly intent on effecting a break with those he referred to disdainfully as &quot;Young Irelanders&quot;—a reference to Giuseppe Mazzini&#x27;s anti-clerical and insurrectionist Young Italy.

In 1847, the Repeal Association tabled resolutions declaring that under no circumstances was a nation justified in asserting its liberties by force of arms. The Young Irelanders had not advocated physical force, but in response to the &quot;Peace Resolutions&quot; Thomas Meagher argued that if Repeal could not be carried by moral persuasion and peaceful means, a resort to arms would be a no less honourable course. O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s son John forced the decision: the resolution was carried on the threat of the O&#x27;Connells themselves quitting the Association.

Duffy and the other Young Ireland dissidents associated with his paper withdrew and formed themselves as the Irish Confederation.

In the desperate circumstances of the Great Famine and in the face of martial-law measures that, following O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s death, a number of Repeal Association MPs had approved in Westminster, Duffy conceded the case for taking &quot;the no less honourable course&quot;. With Mitchel he was arrested, leaving it to Meagher, O&#x27;Brien and Dillon to raise the standard of revolt. This was a republican tricolour with which Meagher had returned from revolutionary Paris, its colours intended to symbolise reconciliation (white) between Catholic (green) and Protestant (orange). But with the rural priesthood against them and the body of their support confined to the garrisoned towns, their efforts issued in a small demonstration that broke up after its first armed encounter, the Battle of Ballingarry. Their death sentences for treason commuted, the leaders were transported to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania). Duffy alone escaped. Defended by Isaac Butt he was freed after his fifth trial.

===The League of North and South===

On his release, Duffy toured famine-stricken Ireland with the renowned Scottish essayist, historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle. Duffy had invited Carlyle, a Unionist and anti-Catholic, in the vain hope that he might help sway establishment opinion in favour of humane and practical relief. Increasingly he was convinced that agrarian reform was the nation&#x27;s existential issue and one that could form the basis for a non-sectarian national movement. From his youth Duffy recalled a Quaker neighbour who had been a United Irishman and had laughed at the idea that the issue was kings and governments. What mattered was the land from which the people got their bread. Instead of singing &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, he said that what the men of &#x27;98 should have borrowed from the French was &quot;their sagacious idea of bundling the landlords out of doors and putting tenants in their shoes&quot;.

In 1842, he had already allied himself with James Godkin who had abandoned a bible mission to campaign for the rights of the Catholic tenants he had been tasked with bringing into the Protestant fold. He now looked to James MacKnight (M&#x27;Knight) who, closely aided by a group of radical Presbyterian ministers, in 1847 had formed the Ulster Tenant Right Association in Derry.

In 1850, a convention called in Dublin by Duffy and MacKnight formed the Irish Tenant Right League. It was committed in its charter to MacKnight&#x27;s &quot;three F&#x27;s&quot;: fair rent, free sale, and fixity of tenure.

Uniting activists across the sectarian and constitutional divide, in 1852, the League helped return Duffy (for New Ross) and 49 other tenant-rights MPs to Westminster. In November 1852, Lord Derby&#x27;s short-lived Conservative government introduced a land bill to compensate Irish tenants on eviction for improvements they had made to the land. The bill passed in the House of Commons in 1853 and 1854, but failed to win consent of the landed grandees in the House of Lords.

What Duffy optimistically hailed as the &quot;League of North and South&quot; unravelled. In the Catholic South, Archbishop Cullen approved the leading Catholic MPs William Keogh and John Sadleir breaking their pledge of independent opposition and accepting positions in a new Whig administration. In the Protestant North William Sharman Crawford and other League candidates had their meetings broken up by Orange &quot;bludgeon men&quot;.

===An &quot;Irish Mazzini&quot;===

To the cause of tenant rights, Cullen was sympathetic, but of Duffy he was deeply suspicious. Following O&#x27;Connell he described Duffy as an &quot;Irish Mazzini&quot;—condemnation from a man who had witnessed the Church&#x27;s humiliation under Mazzini&#x27;s Roman Republic in 1849. Duffy in turn accused the Church under Cullen of pursuing a &quot;Roman policy&quot; in Ireland &quot;hostile to its nationality.&quot;

Until O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s death, Duffy suggested that Rome had &quot;believed in the possibility of an Independent Catholic State&quot; in Ireland, but that since O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s death could &quot;only see the possibility of a Red Republic&quot;. The Curia had, as a result, returned to &quot;her design of treating Ireland as an entrenched camp of Catholicity in the heart of the British Empire, capable of leavening the whole.&quot; Ireland for this purpose had to be&quot;thoroughly imperialised, loyalised, welded into England.&quot;

Cullen has been described as the man who &quot;borrowed the British Empire.&quot; Under his leadership the Irish church developed an &quot;Hiberno-Roman&quot; mission that was ultimately extended through Britain to the entire English-speaking world. But Cullen&#x27;s biographers would argue that Duffy travestied Cullen and his church&#x27;s complex and nuanced relationship to Irish nationalism.—perhaps as much as Cullen caricatured Duffy&#x27;s separatism.

==Australia==

===Emigration and new political career===

The cause of the Irish tenants, and indeed of Ireland generally, seemed to Duffy more hopeless than ever. Broken in health and spirit, he published in 1855 a farewell address to his constituency, declaring that he had resolved to retire from parliament, as it was no longer possible to accomplish the task for which he had solicited their votes. To John Dillon he wrote that an Ireland where McKeogh typified patriotism and Cullen the church was an Ireland in which he could no longer live.

In 1856, Duffy and his family emigrated to Australia. After being feted in Sydney and Melbourne, he settled in the newly formed Colony of Victoria. Duffy was followed to Melbourne by Margaret Callan. Her daughter was later to marry Duffy&#x27;s eldest son by his first marriage, John Gavan Duffy.

Duffy initially practised law in Melbourne, but a public appeal was soon held to enable him to buy the freehold property necessary to stand for the colonial Parliament. He was immediately elected to the Legislative Assembly for Villiers and Heytesbury in the Western District in 1856. A &quot;Melbourne Punch&quot; cartoon depicted Duffy entering Parliament as a bog Irishman carrying a shillelagh atop the parliamentary benches (&quot;Punch&quot;, 4 December 1856, p. 141). He later represented Dalhousie and then North Gippsland.

===Duffy&#x27;s Land Act===

Duffy stood on a platform of land reform. With the collapse of the Victorian Government&#x27;s Haines Ministry, during 1857, another Irish Catholic, John O&#x27;Shanassy, unexpectedly became Premier. Duffy was his deputy as well as Commissioner for Public Works, President of the Board of Land and Works, and Commissioner for Crown Lands and Survey. Irish Catholics serving as Cabinet Ministers was hitherto unknown in the British Empire and the Melbourne&#x27;s Protestant establishment was ill-prepared &quot;to countenance so startling a novelty&quot;.

Duffy&#x27;s Land Act was passed in 1862. Like the Nicholson Act of 1860 which it modified, the Duffy Act provided, in specified areas, for new and extended pastoral leases. It was an effort to break the land-holding monopoly of the so-called &quot;squatter&quot; class. However, the bill had been amended into ineffectiveness by the Legislative Council so that it was easy for the squatters to employ dummies and extend their control. Duffy&#x27;s attempts to correct the legislation were defeated. Historian Don Garden commented that &quot;Unfortunately Duffy&#x27;s dreams were on a higher plane than his practical skills as a legislator and the morals of those opposed to him.&quot;

In 1858–59, &quot;Melbourne Punch&quot; cartoons linked Duffy and O&#x27;Shanassy with images of the French Revolution to undermine their Ministry. One famous &quot;Punch&quot; image, &quot;Citizens John and Charles&quot;, depicted the pair as French revolutionaries holding the skull and cross bone flag of the so-called &quot;Victorian Republic&quot;. The O&#x27;Shanassy Ministry was defeated at the 1859 election and a new government formed.

===Premier of Victoria===

In 1871, Duffy led the opposition to Premier Sir James McCulloch&#x27;s plan to introduce a land tax, on the grounds that it unfairly penalised small farmers. When McCulloch&#x27;s government was defeated on this issue, Duffy became Premier and Chief Secretary (June 1871 to June 1872). Victoria&#x27;s finances were in a poor state and he was forced to introduce a tariff bill to provide government revenue, despite his adherence to British free trade principles.

An Irish Catholic Premier was very unpopular with the Protestant majority in the colony, and Duffy was accused of favouring Catholics in government appointments, an example being the appointment of John Cashel Hoey, who had been his successor as editor of The Nation, to a position in London. In June 1872, his government was defeated in the Assembly on a confidence motion allegedly motivated by sectarianism. He was succeeded as premier by the conservative James Francis and later resigned the leadership of the liberal party in favour of Graham Berry.

===Speakership and retirement===

When Berry became Premier in 1877 he made Duffy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, a post he held without much enthusiasm until handing it over to Peter Lalor, the younger brother of James Fintan Lalor, in 1880. Thereafter he quit politics and retired to southern France where he wrote his memoirs: &quot;The League of North and South, 1850–54&quot; (1886) and &quot;My Life in Two Hemispheres&quot; (1898).

In exile in France, Duffy was an enthusiastic supporter of the Melbourne Celtic Club, which aimed to promote Irish Home Rule and Irish culture. His sons also became members of the club.

In recognition of his services to Victoria, he was knighted in 1873 and made  in 1877. He married for a third time in Paris in 1881, to Louise Hall, and they had four more children.

== Marriages and children ==

In 1842, Duffy married Emily McLaughlin (1820–1845), with whom he had two children, one of whom survived, his son John Gavan Duffy. Emily died in 1845. In 1846 he married his cousin from Newry, Susan Hughes (1827–1878), with whom he had eight children, six of whom survived. After Susan died in 1878, he married for a third time, in Paris in 1881, to Louise Hall (1858–1889) by whom had two further children.

Of his eight surviving children:

* John Gavan Duffy (1844–1917) was a Victorian politician who served variously as Minister for Agriculture, Attorney-General, and Postmaster-General.

*Sir Frank Gavan Duffy (1852–1936), was Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia 1931–35.

*Sir Charles Cashel Gavan Duffy (1855-1932) was clerk of the Australian House of Representatives in 1901-17 and of the Senate in 1917-20.

*Philip Cormac Gavan Duffy (1862–1954) a surveyor and civil engineer noted for his work in Western Australia on the Coolgardie water supply,

*Louise Gavan Duffy (1884–1969) was the joint secretary of the nationalist women&#x27;s organization, Cumann na mBan, and was an Irish republican present at the 1916 Easter Rising and an Irish language enthusiast who founded an Irish language school, Scoil Bhride (St Bridget)&#x27;s Girls School in Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin. 

*George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) was an Irish politician and a signatory to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921. From 1936 onward he was a justice on the Irish High Court, becoming its president from 1946 until his death in 1951. One year before his death, he heard the &quot;Tilson Case&quot;, in which he applied the notorious &quot;ne temere&quot; decree to the letter as de Valera&#x27;s 1937 Irish Constitution gave the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland a &quot;special position&quot;.

A grandson, Sir Charles Leonard Gavan Duffy, was a judge on the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia.

==Death==

Sir Charles Gavan Duffy died in Nice, France in 1903, aged 86. 

He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.

<text>Raoul Dufy (; 3 June 1877 – 23 March 1953) was a French painter associated with the Fauvist movement. He gained recognition for his vibrant and decorative style, which became popular in various forms, such as textile designs, and public building decorations. Dufy is most remembered for his artwork depicting outdoor social gatherings. In addition to painting, he was skilled in various other fields, including drawing, printmaking, book illustration, scenic design, furniture design, and planning public spaces.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dufy was born 3 June 1877 in Le Havre, Normandy, the second of eleven children, to Léon Marius Dufy, an accountant in a steel manufacturing company and talented musician, and Marie Eugénie Ida Dufy (née Lemonnier), originally from Honfleur, Normandy. Among his siblings was Jean Dufy, who would also become an artist later in life.

At age 14, Dufy left school to work for a coffee-importing company. In 1895, at age 18, he began taking evening art classes at Le Havre&#x27;s École des Beaux-Arts, taught by Charles Lhuillier, a former student of the French portrait painter Ingres. There he met Raimond Lecourt and Othon Friesz, with whom he later shared a studio in Montmartre and maintained a lifelong friendship. During this period, Dufy primarily painted Norman landscapes in watercolors.

In 1900, after a year of military service, Dufy won a scholarship to the École Nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he again crossed paths with Othon Friesz (who was also there when Georges Braque was studying). Dufy focused on improving his drawing skills, influenced by impressionist landscape painters such as Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro. His first exhibition was in 1901, at the Exhibition of French Artists. Dufy was introduced to Berthe Weill in 1902 and showed his work in her gallery. He exhibited again in 1903, at the Salon des Indépendants. His work gained some notable recognition when artist Maurice Denis bought one of his paintings. Dufy continued to paint, often in the vicinity of Le Havre, particularly on the beach at Sainte-Adresse, made famous by its association with artists Eugène Boudin and Claude Monet. In 1904, he worked in Fécamp, on the English Channel (La Manche), with his friend Albert Marquet.

===Later years===
Henri Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Luxe, Calme et Volupté&quot;, which Dufy saw at the Salon des Independents in 1905, directed his interests towards Fauvism. &quot;Les Fauves&quot; (the wild beasts) emphasized bright color and bold contours in their work. Dufy&#x27;s painting reflected this aesthetic until about 1909 when contact with the work of Paul Cézanne led him to adopt a subtler technique. However, it was not until 1920, after he had dabbled in another style, Cubism, that Dufy developed his own distinctive approach. This distinctive style encompassed the arrangement of skeletal structures using foreshortened perspective, coupled with the application of rapid, thin color washes. This method later became recognized as &quot;stenographic&quot;. In his oils and watercolors, he frequently depicted contemporary scenes, including yachting events, elegant social gatherings, and views of the French Riviera. For the 1937 Exposition Internationale in Paris, Dufy produced &quot;La Fée Electricité,&quot; one of the largest paintings of its time, an expansive and widely acclaimed work celebrating electricity, executed in oil on plywood.

Dufy also acquired a reputation as an illustrator and commercial artist. He painted murals for public buildings and produced a significant number of tapestries and ceramic designs. His plates appear in books by Guillaume Apollinaire, Stéphane Mallarmé and André Gide. In 1909, Dufy was commissioned by Paul Poiret to design stationery for the house. After 1912, he designed textile patterns for Bianchini-Ferier, which were used for garments worn by Poiret and Charvet. The Bois de Boulogne is a dress that was designed by Paul Poiret, textile design by Dufy, and textile manufactured by Bianchini-Ferier. Dufy had a bold and graphic design approach that reflected Paul Poirets&#x27; personal preference and style. Both, Poiret and Dufy, would come together many times to create many new designs.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Dufy exhibited at the annual Salon des Tuileries in Paris. By 1950, his ability to paint was diminished when his hands were impaired by rheumatoid arthritis and he had to fasten a brush to his hand to work. In April he went to Boston to undergo an experimental treatment with cortisone and corticotropin, based on the work of Philip S. Hench. It proved successful, and some of his next works were dedicated to the doctors and researchers in the United States. In 1952 he received the grand prize for painting in the 26th Venice Biennale. Dufy died of intestinal bleeding at Forcalquier, France, on 23 March 1953, likely the result of his continuous treatment. He was buried near Matisse in the Cimiez Monastery Cemetery in Cimiez, a suburb of the city of Nice.

<doc id="744876" wikidata="Q1421880" url="?curid=744876" title="Michael Dugan (general)">
<text>Michael Joseph Dugan (born February 22, 1937) is a retired American general. He was briefly the 13th Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force (USAF) for 79 days in 1990 until he was dismissed by U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney after telling reporters that the U.S. military planned to target Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, his family, and even his mistress in the 1991 Gulf War. He became the first member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be dismissed since Admiral Louis Denfeld in 1949, and the first top general to be relieved since General Douglas MacArthur in 1951.

==Early life and education==

Dugan was born in Albany, New York. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Military Academy in 1958, and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Colorado in 1972. He completed Squadron Officer School in 1965, Air Command and Staff College in 1970 and the Air War College in 1973.

==Military career==

Dugan&#x27;s early operational assignments were in F-100 Super Sabres and A-1 Skyraiders during the Vietnam War. He flew A-1s during 1967, from Pleiku Air Base, Republic of Vietnam, and Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. He then planned and taught cadet military training courses and served as cadet squadron and group air officer commanding at the United States Air Force Academy.

From June 1973 to July 1977, Dugan was assigned to Headquarters USAF, Washington, D.C., as an action officer and branch chief in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, and then as executive to the vice chief of staff. He next served at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, as vice commander and, later, commander of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing. He subsequently became commander of the 23rd Tactical Fighter Wing, England AFB, Louisiana, and commander of the 832d Air Division, Luke AFB, Arizona.

In May 1982, he moved to Langley AFB, Virginia, where he served successively as Tactical Air Command&#x27;s assistant deputy chief of staff for operations, inspector general and deputy chief of staff for operations. He was assigned to the deputy chief of staff for plans and operations at USAF headquarters as director of operations in June 1986, and as assistant deputy chief of staff in January 1987. He became the USAF deputy chief of staff, programs and resources, in July 1987. He then became deputy chief of staff, plans and operations, in March 1988.

Dugan assumed command of United States Air Forces in Europe on April 12, 1989 and was promoted to general on May 1, 1989, with the same date of rank. He went on to become Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force in July 1990.

As chief, he served as the senior uniformed USAF officer responsible for the organization, training and equipage of a combined active duty, Air National Guard, Reserve and civilian force of nearly 1 million people serving at approximately 3,000 locations in the United States and overseas. As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he and the other service chiefs functioned as the principal military advisers to the Secretary of Defense, National Security Council and the President. During his brief tenure as Chief of Staff, Alaskan Air Command stood down, and was reduced to Numbered Air Force status as Headquarters, Eleventh Air Force, falling under the jurisdiction of Pacific Air Forces.

Dugan is a command pilot with 4,500 flying hours and 300 combat missions. His military decorations include the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, Distinguished Flying Cross, Purple Heart, Air Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters and Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm.

==Removal from post==
In September 1990, during the lead-up to the Persian Gulf War after Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq had invaded Kuwait, Dugan revealed to reporters that the U.S. military had plans to bomb Baghdad &quot;relentlessly&quot; and &quot;decapitate&quot; the Iraqi leadership by targeting Hussein personally, along with his family, his senior commanders, his palace guard and even his mistress. He said that he had personally &quot;assigned a team to find Iraqi military defectors, knowledgeable professors, Iraqi expatriates and journalists who recently have visited Baghdad to learn more about Iraqi culture&quot; so that he could get &quot;a better list&quot; of targets that would cause the most psychological damage to the Iraqi people if bombed. The list stressed the importance of attacking Hussein and his inner circle, but beyond that, Dugan would not detail the potential Iraqi leverage points he intend[ed] to try to destroy.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who had warned Dugan previously about speaking with journalists because he was known to be &quot;loose-lipped,&quot; fired Dugan, saying he had shown &quot;poor judgment at a sensitive time&quot; adding, &quot;We never talk about the targeting of specific individuals who are officials of other governments. Taking such action might be a violation of the standing presidential executive order &#x27;banning assassinations.&#x27;&quot; Dugan was replaced by General Merrill McPeak and retired from the Air Force on January 1, 1991.

On January 17, 1991, the aerial bombardment of Iraq began which destroyed much of the civilian and military infrastructure of Iraq, though Saddam Hussein, his family, and mistress were unharmed. After being removed from office, Dugan remained on active duty while transitioning into retirement. He was allowed to hold onto his four-star rank, and was reassigned as the Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force. The Senate approved Dugan&#x27;s four-star retirement rank and he retired from the Air Force on January 1, 1991.

==Post-military career==
Dugan went on to serve as the president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and is now President Emeritus of that organization.

<text>The second USS &quot;San Juan&quot; (CL-54), and the first to be named for the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was an light cruiser of the United States Navy. She was laid down on 15 May 1940 by the Bethlehem Steel Co. (Fore River), Quincy, Massachusetts; launched on 6 September 1941; sponsored by Mrs. Margarita Coll de Santori; and commissioned on 28 February 1942.

==Service history==

===1942===
After shakedown in the Atlantic, &quot;San Juan&quot; departed from Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 5 June 1942 as part of a carrier task group formed around the aircraft carrier and bound for the Pacific. The group got underway from San Diego on 30 June escorting a large group of troop transports destined for the Solomon Islands where the Navy was about to launch the first major American amphibious operation of the war.

Following rehearsal in the Fiji Islands, &quot;San Juan&quot; provided gunfire support for the landings at Tulagi on 7 August 1942. On the night of 8–9 August, she was patrolling the eastern approaches to the transport area between Tulagi and Guadalcanal, with Admiral Norman Scott embarked, when gun flashes indicated that fighting was taking place in the western approaches. The action turned out to be the Battle of Savo Island, in which an enemy cruiser force sank four Allied cruisers. &quot;San Juan&quot; retired from the forward area with the empty transports on the 9th and escorted them to Noumea.

She then rejoined &quot;Wasp&quot; and operated with the carrier force for several weeks between the New Hebrides and the Solomons, on guard against a Japanese carrier attack. However, when this strike materialized on 24 August, &quot;San Juan&quot; had withdrawn to refuel and thus missed the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. was hit in the battle, and &quot;San Juan&quot;, which had damaged a gun mount off Guadalcanal, escorted the carrier to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 10 September 1942.

On 5 October, the cruiser again headed for the South Pacific, stopping first at Funafuti in the Ellice Islands to deliver a deck load of 20 mm guns to the marines who had just landed there. She then carried out a raid through the Gilberts sinking two Japanese patrol vessels on 16 October. Disembarking Japanese prisoners at Espiritu Santo, the cruiser joined &quot;Enterprise&quot; on the 23rd. Three days later, after patrol planes had made contact with enemy carrier forces, the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands was fought in which the aircraft carrier was lost and &quot;Enterprise&quot; damaged while the Japanese suffered severe losses in aircraft and pilots. During the last dive-bombing attack on the formation, one bomb passed through &quot;San Juan&quot;″s stern, flooding several compartments and damaging, though not disabling, her rudder. She arrived at Nouméa with the task force on 30 October and then spent ten days at Sydney, Australia, receiving permanent repairs. &quot;San Juan&quot; joined the aircraft carrier at Nadi, Viti Levu Island, in the Fijis on 24 November.

===1943===
From December 1942 to June 1943, &quot;San Juan&quot; was based at Nouméa and operated in the Coral Sea, both with carrier groups and alone. At the end of June 1943, during the occupation of New Georgia, &quot;San Juan&quot;″s carrier group patrolled the Coral Sea for 26 days to prevent enemy interference. Late in July, the force made a quick stop at Nouméa and moved to the New Hebrides, first to Havannah Harbor, Efate, and later to Espiritu Santo.

On 1 November, the &quot;Saratoga&quot; group, including &quot;San Juan&quot;, neutralized airfields on Bougainville and Rabaul while Allied forces landed on Bougainville. In the middle of November, the task group acted as a covering force for the occupation of the Gilberts. &quot;San Juan&quot; then joined the aircraft carrier on a raid on Kwajalein in the Marshalls, fighting off persistent torpedo plane attacks on 4–5 December. Detached on 6 December, the cruiser returned to the United States for overhaul at Mare Island.

===1944===
&quot;San Juan&quot; rejoined &quot;Saratoga&quot; off Pearl Harbor on 19 January 1944 and the force covered the occupation of Eniwetok in February. &quot;San Juan&quot; next escorted the carriers and in strikes on Palau, Yap, and Ulithi on 30 March and 1 April. On 7 April, the cruiser joined the new carrier , which covered the landings at Hollandia in April and then struck at Truk on 29–30 April. After returning to bases in the Marshalls, the &quot;Hornet&quot; group began support of the Marianas campaign in early June, striking at Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima in the Bonins, while American troops landed on Saipan. &quot;San Juan&quot; helped guard her group during the Battle of the Philippine Sea when American naval air power decisively defeated a Japanese counterattack to save the Marianas, and, in doing so, all but wiped out Japanese naval air strength.

After a short stop at Eniwetok, &quot;San Juan&quot; escorted the new and during July as they covered the capture of Guam with strikes on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima. After a strike on Palau and Ulithi, &quot;San Juan&quot; was ordered to San Francisco for overhaul, and departed from Eniwetok on 4 August escorting &quot;Yorktown&quot;.

Following refresher training at San Diego and Pearl Harbor, &quot;San Juan&quot; joined &quot;Lexington&quot;″s task group at Ulithi on 21 November. In early December, she screened the carriers in strikes on Formosa and Luzon in support of landings on Mindoro. During this operation, she was sent alone within scouting range of Japanese airfields in an effort to draw out Japanese aircraft by radio deception, but none rose to the bait. On 18–19 December, the force was battered by a typhoon, and returned to Ulithi on Christmas Eve.

===1945===
Underway again six days later, the carriers covered the occupation of Luzon with strikes on Formosa, Okinawa, and Luzon from 3–9 January 1945, and then from 10–20 January raided ports and shipping in the South China Sea, particularly Saigon, Cam Ranh Bay, and Hong Kong. After replenishing at Ulithi, &quot;San Juan&quot; escorted &quot;Hornet&quot; in air strikes on Tokyo during the Iwo Jima operation in February and then returned to Ulithi on 1 March to prepare for the Okinawa invasion.

&quot;San Juan&quot; rejoined &quot;Hornet&quot; on 22 March and, until 30 April, operated with her to the north and east of Nansei Shoto, interrupting her regular occupation of supporting air strikes and replenishment at sea with a bombardment, on 21 April, of Minami Daito Shima, a small island about 180 mi (290 km) from Okinawa. Planes from &quot;San Juan&quot;″s group helped sink the giant on 7 April. After nine days at Ulithi, the &quot;Hornet&quot; group was back on station off Nansei Shoto for strikes on targets in Japan. &quot;San Juan&quot; arrived in Leyte Gulf on 13 June for repairs and then joined , on 1 July for more strikes on the Japanese home islands. She was at sea when the news of the Japanese capitulation was received on 15 August, and, on the 27th, after 59 days at sea, she joined the van forces for the triumphal entry of the 3rd Fleet into Sagami Wan, just outside Tokyo Bay.

&quot;San Juan&quot;″s embarked unit commander, Commodore Rodger W. Simpson, was assigned responsibility for freeing, caring for, and evacuating Allied prisoners of war in Japan. On 29 August, the ship entered Tokyo Bay and landed parties which liberated prisoners at camps at Omori and Ofuna and the Shanagawa hospital. The former prisoners were transferred to hospital ships and . After evacuating camps in the Tokyo Bay area, &quot;San Juan&quot; moved to the Nagoya-Hamamatsu area to the south and then to the Sendai-Kamanishi area to the north. On completing her liberation duty, the cruiser moored on 23 September next to the last Japanese battleship, , at Yokosuka shifting to an outer anchorage there on 28 October. She sailed for the United States on 14 November, disembarked Commodore Simpson at Pearl Harbor, and continued to the US with homeward bound troops, arriving on 29 November. Three days later, she sailed on &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty to Nouméa and Tutuila, returning to San Pedro, California, on 9 January 1946 with a full load of troops.

==Decommissioning and sale==
The cruiser arrived at Bremerton, Washington, for inactivation on 24 January 1946, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve there on 9 November 1946. &quot;San Juan&quot; was redesignated CLAA-54 on 28 February 1949. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959 and sold on 31 October 1961 to National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California, for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;San Juan&quot; received 13 battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="744883" wikidata="Q3046920" url="?curid=744883" title="Ecco Jr.">
<text>Ecco Jr. is a video game in the &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; series, released by Sega in North America in April 1995 and in Australia in November 1995. It has the controls and basic gameplay of the other two Mega Drive/Genesis titles, but is geared towards younger players, lacking the high difficulty of &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==Gameplay==
In this game, a younger version of Ecco goes to see Big Blue, an ancient blue whale, completing tasks such as herding seahorses, swimming through rings, and finding lost balls for sea lions along the way. The gameplay is similar to the other &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; games, but mainly revolves around using these abilities for solving simple puzzles and problems. One key difference is that the player character cannot drown by staying underwater too long. Likewise, there are no enemies to attack the player character. Two other playable characters were introduced: Tara the baby orca (there is also a bottlenose dolphin character named Tara in &quot;Ecco: The Tides of Time&quot;) and Kitnee the young Atlantic dolphin, who is darker gray than Ecco. The player can switch characters at any time.

&quot;Ecco Jr.&quot; features a password system, though all the passwords are included in the instruction manual. &quot;Ecco Jr.&quot; also features a &quot;Parent&#x27;s Menu&quot; that includes a difficulty settings menu, level selection option, and facts about real dolphins.

==Release==
A follow-up to this title, called &quot;Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt!&quot;, was also available on the Sega Pico.

&quot;Ecco Jr.&quot; was released on the Sega Mega Drive in Australia, the only PAL version of the game released on cartridge, in November 1995. In Japan the game was only released on the Sega Channel on August 16, 1995. The game made its European debut on February 2, 2007, on the &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; for PlayStation 2 and PSP. &quot;Ecco Jr.&quot; was also made available on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console on November 6, 2007, in Japan, November 26, 2007, in North America and August 8, 2008, in Europe. The game was also released on Steam on September 13, 2010.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the game a rave review, commenting that &quot;all the creatures and background scenery have the same breathtaking visual appeal of the grown-up Ecco adventures&quot;. They particularly approved of how the game, unlike previous games in the series, is accessible to younger players. 

&quot;Electronic Games&quot; gave the game an A, praising the graphics, music, and sound effects.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, gave it two out of five stars, commenting that &quot;to &quot;Ecco Jr.&quot;″s credit, it has some beautiful graphics and simplistic gameplay that&#x27;ll be an easy play for the youngest of gamers. However, this game is nothing more than a way for Sega to dig its claws into the impressionable minds of young children and make them believe they need to graduate to the first (and more original) &quot;Ecco&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="744885" wikidata="Q512172" url="?curid=744885" title="Winston Dugan, 1st Baron Dugan of Victoria">
<text>Major General Winston Joseph Dugan, 1st Baron Dugan of Victoria, (3 September 1876 – 17 August 1951), known as Sir Winston Dugan between 1934 and 1949, was a British administrator and a career British Army officer. He served as Governor of South Australia from 1934 to 1939, then Governor of Victoria until 1949.

==Background and education==
Dugan was the son of Charles Winston Dugan, of Oxmantown Mall, Birr, County Offaly, Ireland, an inspector of schools. His mother was born Esther Elizabeth Rogers. He attended Lurgan College, Craigavon, Ireland from 1887 to 1889, and Wimbledon College, Wimbledon, London, England. The family name was pronounced as &quot;Duggan&quot;. They were originally from County Galway and were a branch of the Soghain people.

==Military career==
Dugan was a sergeant in the Royal Sussex Regiment, but transferred to the Lincolnshire Regiment as a second lieutenant on 24 January 1900. He left Southampton two months later with a detachment sent to reinforce the 2nd battalion of his regiment in the Second Boer War. While in South Africa, he was appointed adjutant of his battalion on 28 June 1901, and promoted to lieutenant on 1 November 1901. For his service in the war, he received the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal with three clasps.

He later fought with distinction in the First World War, where he was wounded and mentioned in despatches six times. He was promoted in July 1916 to the temporary rank of brigadier general and commanded the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division&#x27;s 184th (2nd South Midland) Brigade on the Western Front. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1915 and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1918.

In 1929 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and the following year he was promoted to major general. From June 1931 to June 1934 he commanded the 56th (London) Infantry Division, Territorial Army.

==Governor of South Australia==
In 1934, Dugan was appointed Governor of South Australia. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), retired from the army and moved to Adelaide with his wife. They became an extremely popular and glamorous vice-regal couple. Sir Winston and Lady Dugan were both excellent public speakers, and travelled widely to bring problems to the attention of the ministers of the day. He gave moral and financial support to numerous good causes and needy individuals. Upon the expiration of his term, there was bipartisan parliamentary support for him to serve a second term, but he had already accepted an appointment to be Governor of Victoria.

==Governor of Victoria==
Sir Winston and Lady Dugan arrived in Melbourne on 17 July 1939. They continued their active role in community affairs, promoting unemployment reduction and making the ballroom of Government House, Melbourne available for the Australian Red Cross.

Dugan had an active role stabilising state politics during the tumultuous 1940s. Upon the disintegration of Albert Dunstan&#x27;s Country Party government in 1943, he installed the Labor leader John Cain as premier. Four days later, Dunstan formed a coalition with the United Australia Party. Following the collapse of that ministry in 1945, Dugan dissolved parliament and called a general election for November, which resulted in the balance of power being held by independents. Dugan commissioned Cain to form the ministry of a minority government.

Dugan&#x27;s term as governor was extended five times. He was also the Administrator of the Commonwealth on two occasions: from 5 September 1944 to 30 January 1945, between the departure of the governor-general, Lord Gowrie, and the arrival of his successor, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and from 19 January to 11 March 1947, between the departure of the Duke of Gloucester and the appointment of his successor, William McKell. He returned to England in February 1949. On 7 July 1949 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Dugan of Victoria, of Lurgan in the County of Armagh.

==Personal life==
Dugan married Ruby Lilian, daughter of Charles Abbott of Kilcaskan, County Cork, in 1912. There were no children from the marriage. He died at Marylebone, London, on 17 August 1951, aged 74. He was buried at All Saints Church, adjacent to the Applewhaite estate, in South Pickenham, Norfolk.

<text>James Duggan (May 22, 1825 – March 27, 1899) was an Irish-born American Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Chicago from 1859 until his resignation in 1880. However, from 1869 to 1880, he was held in a sanatorium in Missouri due to insanity.

Duggan previously served as coadjutor Archbishop of St. Louis from 1857 to 1859.

==Biography==

===Early years===

James Duggan was born on May 22, 1825, in Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland, a clothier&#x27;s son. At the invitation of Bishop Peter Kenrick, recruiting young men to fill the need for priests in Missouri, he emigrated to the United States in 1842, to complete studies for the priesthood at St. Vincent&#x27;s Seminary in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. 

=== Priesthood ===
Duggan was ordained a priest for the Diocese of St. Louis by Kenrick in St. Louis on May 29, 1847.

In November 1853, Bishop James Van Velde left the Diocese of Chicago after Pope Pius IX appointed him as bishop of the Diocese of Natchez in Mississippi. Duggan was named as the temporary administrator of the diocese, serving until the installation of Anthony O&#x27;Regan in late 1854 as the new bishop. After Duggan returned to St. Louis, Kenrick appointed him as vicar general. 

=== Coadjutor archbishop of St. Louis ===
Duggan was appointed as coadjutor archbishop of St. Louis and titular bishop of Gabala by Pope Pius IX on January 9, 1857 to assist Kenrick. On May 3, 1857, Kenrick consecrated Duggan at the Cathedral of St. Louis in St. Louis. 

While coadjutor archbishop, Duggan also served as administrator of Chicago for a second time when Pius IX accepted O&#x27;Regan&#x27;s resignation in June 1858 for health reasons. When Duggan became administrator, the city was still recovering financially from the Panic of 1857. In addition, there was a great deal of animosity among parishioners toward past bishops. The French-Canadian Catholic community believed that Bishop Anthony O&#x27;Regan had stolen their parish property. The German immigrants, the largest Catholic community in the diocese, resented that the pope had chosen O&#x27;Regan, an Irish cleric, as their bishop.

===Bishop of Chicago===
On January 21, 1859, Pius IX appointed Duggan as the fourth bishop of Chicago at age 34. That same year, Duggan founded the House of the Good Shepherd in Chicago for what were termed &quot;delinquent women.&quot; Its operation was given to the religious sisters of the Sisters of the Holy Cross.

During his times in Illinois, Dugan had become close friends with US Senator Stephen A Douglas. Douglas had engaged with Abraham Lincoln in a famous series of debates about slavery in 1858. On June 2, 1861, Duggan visited Douglas on his deathbed in Chicago. He died the next day.

In 1863, Duggan laid the foundation for a new building at the University of St. Mary of the Lake . The diocese also established new schools of medicine and law there. However, as financial pressures increased and enrollment dropped, a rift developed between Duggan and the university administration. St. Mary of the Lake closed in 1866 due to its financial problems.

Duggan in 1864 denounced the Fenian Brotherhood as being illegal and condemned by the Catholic Church. The Brotherhood was a secret society of Irish immigrants that started during the American Civil War. Its ultimate aim was fomenting an armed rebellion in Ireland against British rule. Duggan warned that any Catholics participating in the Brotherhood would be denied the sacraments. This denunciation prompted animosity against Duggan among many Irish congregants and clergy in the diocese. 

St. Mary of the Lake University closed in 1866 due to its financial problems. In October 1866, Duggan traveled to Baltimore to attend the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore. Duggan had held a reputation in Chicago for intelligence, affability, and eloquence. However, after returning from Baltimore, he started exhibiting mood swings, erratic behavior and signs of psychological stress. His colleagues in the diocese became concerned for his mental health. At some point during the ensuing two years, Duggen took a trip to Europe to recuperate. While he was away, several clergy in the diocese wrote to the Vatican, asking them to examine Duggen&#x27;s competency. 

After arriving back in Chicago, Duggan in 1868 closed the seminary on the Saint Mary of the Lake campus and converted it into an orphanage.He also dismissed four priests that had been his close advisors, alarming others in the Chicago hierarchy. Duggan invited the Sisters of Charity to open St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Chicago that same year; he provided them with furniture and beds from the closed seminary.

=== Institutionalization and death ===
On April 14, 1869, Pius IX ruled that Duggan was no longer mentally capable of performing his duties and sent him to a sanatorium operated by the Sisters of Charity in St. Louis. The pope felt it unjust to simply remove Duggan as bishop since he had broken no canon laws. Therefore, he would officially remain bishop of Chicago. 

Pius IX named Reverend Thomas Foley from the Archdiocese of Baltimore as coadjutor bishop to administer the diocese, filling that role until his death in 1879. In September 1880, Duggan was sufficiently rational to sign a letter of resignation as bishop of Chicago, allowing the pope to appoint a new one. 

Duggan died at the sanatorium in St. Louis on March 27, 1899. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois. 

== Legacy ==
On March 29, 2001, the archdiocese moved Duggan&#x27;s remains to the Bishop&#x27;s Mausoleum at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. At the reinterment ceremony, Cardinal Francis George spoke about rectifying the injustice that had been done to Duggan and the stigma of mental illness

<doc id="744888" wikidata="Q7355296" url="?curid=744888" title="Rockhurst High School">
<text>Rockhurst High School is a private, Jesuit, all-boys preparatory school founded in 1910 along with Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Missouri, United States. It moved away from the College in 1962 to a campus on State Line Road in Kansas City.

Rockhurst is accredited by the North Central Education Association and is a member of the North Central Education Association of Independent College Preparatory Schools, the Jesuit Secondary Education Association, and the National Association for College Admission Counseling (and its regional affiliates).

==History==
In 1908, the Michael P. Dowling, S.J., selected the site for a Jesuit school at 52nd and Troost Street in Kansas City. The name &quot;Rockhurst&quot; was chosen because large rocks found on the grounds resembled those at the Jesuit Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, England. Rockhurst was established by the Society of Jesus and chartered by the State of Missouri as part of Rockhurst College in August 1910. Classes began in the fall of 1914, and the school changed its name to Rockhurst High School in 1923. The high school shared a campus and corporate umbrella with the College until 1962, when it moved to the Greenlease Campus (named for its principal benefactor, Robert C. Greenlease).

In 2017 Fr. Terrence Baum, S.J., concluded 12 years as president of the high school. He had overseen a $41.3 million fund-raising campaign which allowed capital improvements including Loyola Center athletic complex, a dining commons, and interactive classrooms. In 2018, former Rockhurst High School principal David J. Laughlin returned to be the school&#x27;s first lay president.

== Academics ==
Fifty-six semester credits are required for graduation. This includes four years of English, of mathematics and computer programming, and of theology; three years of social studies and of physical science; two years of modern and classical languages; one semester of communication arts and another of communications arts or visual and performing arts; and a semester of computer education and of physical education. To this are added 12 semesters of college-preparatory electives.

Beginning in 2017 Rockhurst has pioneered the STEAM tech-savvy, more active learning method in the sciences.

== Spiritual retreat program ==
All freshmen participate in a two-and-a-half day retreat experience focused on community and love of God, with the diverse members of the Rockhurst community as presenters. All sophomores participate in a day of reflection on how they are realizing God&#x27;s hopes for them, followed by a conversation on the same topic with their parents, a member of the Rockhurst staff being present as facilitator. All juniors make one of the three and a half-day Kairos retreats. Focus is on Christ working in their lives; Talks by Rockhurst student leaders and adults stimulate group discussions and private reflection. Seniors are offered options of making three-day retreats based on Ignatius&#x27; Spiritual Exercises and two-day camping retreats with a focus on finding God in nature. Neither is required but both may be made more than once.

==Service to others==
All students participate in the school&#x27;s voluntary service program throughout their four years. Freshmen are introduced to voluntary service during freshman orientation days, again during their retreat, and at one of the special freshman service days. In sophomore and junior years each student puts in at least 40 hours performing some corporal work of mercy. Seniors spend three weeks on a senior project of their choice, working with people who have special needs.

Beyond the required service hours, Rockhurst has additional projects which students take on in a program named after Jesuit Father General Pedro Arrupe, who called on Jesuit schools to educate men and women for others. This includes the Joseph of Arimathea Society, Snowmen for Others, For the Greater (Morning) Glory, Hurtado’s Mentors, Claver Homeless Ministry, Friends of L&#x27;Arche, and Upper Room Tutors.

The Total Ignatian Experience program provides the whole Rockhurst community, including parents, with opportunities for immersion experiences in summers; seniors may also do this during their January service experience. Programs offered are in Kansas City, St. Louis, Appalachia, Tijuana, and Guatemala. Running the Harvest Food Drive and Mission Week are also a part of this program.

The Jesuit Alumni Service Corps (ASC) involves graduates of Jesuit schools in a year of teaching at a Jesuit secondary school. Eleven Rockhurst High School graduates have served in ASC and in 2016 there were 16 former ASC members on the Rockhurst faculty.

== Programs and awards ==
Rockhurst offers to students 61 extracurricular clubs and activities. Primary among these are the drama, choral, and instrumental music programs which are meant to supplement the required semester in a fine or performing arts class. The school choir has performed in concert at the Jesuit parish in town.

From the student government organization, one of the more prominent student body presidents was Tim Kaine, class of &#x27;76, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s running mate in the US presidential election of 2016. In 2016 eight students in the Mock Trial Club took second place in the state.

Prior to admittance, the Alberto Hurtado Scholars Program offers a year-round educational enrichment program for boys in grades 6-8 who are very capable but have not had the educational opportunities to prepare them for the Rockhurst admissions test.

Recognition given for student achievement includes the following annual awards. There are awards in each academic discipline. Students are inducted into the National Honor Society. The Environmental Leadership Award is given to students who have excelled in this area. Perfect and exemplary attendance awards are given. There are numerous awards of distinction: Advanced Placement Scholars; National Merit Commended, Semi-Finalists and Finalists; National Achievement Scholarship Program; National Hispanic Recognition; and book awards sponsored by universities. R Awards are conferred on students who show exemplary generosity in building up the RHS community. And 28 students in 2016 had put in over 100 hours of service and received the President&#x27;s Volunteer Service Award. One senior is voted by classmates to receive the Senior Class Award, for service to the school. On the same basis the Carl G. Kloster, S.J., “Special R” Award is voted on by faculty and staff, who also bestow the Jesuit Secondary Education Association Award on the basis of Christian and Ignatian ideals.

In 2013 the school initiated a drug testing program. Only a few students tested positive, and their parents were informed. Upon a second instance the school becomes involved.

==Athletics==
Rockhurst is classified as a Class 6A school by the Missouri State High School Activities Association, meaning that it competes against the largest high schools in Missouri during state competition.

===State championships===
MSHSAA&#x27;s classification nomenclature has changed over time and often has varied by sport, so many of the titles listed below were won in divisions known by different names, i.e. Class 3, Class 5A, etc.; however, each title falls under the Class 6A designation either by name or by the criteria outlined by MSHSAA at the time the title was won. Rockhurst has won 75 titles as of 2017.

Rockhurst won 35 state championships in the decade beginning in 2005, and six state championships in 2008-2009 alone. Its record for placings in a single year is 2007, with seven. Also, in 1987 Rockhurst became the only institution in the history of Missouri high school athletics to win football and basketball state championships in the same year. Rockhurst&#x27;s athletics program was named by Sports Illustrated as the best in Missouri and one of the top ten in the country in 2009. In 2012 MaxPreps ranked the school&#x27;s football team as having been the most consistently highly ranked state team since 2004. In 2016 and again in 2023, Rockhurst&#x27;s soccer team reached the number one ranking in the nation. The 2023 team finished as national champions.

Rockhurst is not affiliated with any local high school athletic conferences, and because it is not a public school its student make-up is not geographically restricted. Its biggest rivals in the Kansas City area are Shawnee Mission East, Bishop Miege, Blue Springs High School and Blue Springs South High School.

===Program-specific accomplishments===

====Football====

Rockhurst is the only school to win a championship in each major state championship venue: Busch Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium, the University of Missouri&#x27;s Faurot Field, and the Edward Jones Dome. It also won a championship in a &quot;non-championship&quot; venue: its first championship, in 1971, at William Chrisman High School, against St. Louis (MO) Beaumont. Its nine football championships rank the school fourth in Missouri history, behind Jefferson City High School which has 10, Valle Catholic High School, which has 12, and Webb City High School which has 16. The team has been to 14 state championships, second only to Webb City, which has been to 19 championship games, and it is the all-time leader in state playoff appearances and state playoff wins. Five Rockhurst teams have won the state championship with perfect records: 1971, 2000, 2002, 2007, and 2010. The 2000, 2002, 2007, and 2010 teams finished the season nationally ranked 14th, 6th, 20th, and 19th respectively (after finishing 14–0, 13–0, 13–0, and 14–0). The back-to-back state championship teams of 1986 and 1987 also finished nationally ranked, 14th and 13th respectively (after finishing 11–1 and 12–1).

The last three head coaches of Rockhurst&#x27;s football team, Al Davis Jr., Jerry Culver, and Tony Severino, are all members of Missouri&#x27;s High School Coaches Hall of Fame, and all won state championships. Davis was a two-time recipient of the Knute Rockne Award and Severino was named &quot;USA Today&#x27;s&quot; National Coach of the Year in 2000.

<text>Benjamin Newton Duke (April 25, 1855 – January 8, 1929) was an American tobacco, textile and energy industrialist and philanthropist. He served as vice-president at American Tobacco Company, being also founder of Duke Energy.

==Life and career==

He was the son of industrialist Washington Duke and his second wife Artelia Roney. His older half-brother was Brodie Leonidas Duke (1846–1919) and his full brother was James Buchanan Duke (1856–1925).

On February 21, 1875, Benjamin Duke married Sarah Pearson Angier, with whom he had a daughter, Mary Lillian Duke, and a son, Angier Buchanan Duke. Portraits of all four members of the family were commissioned from the Spanish painter Joaquín Sorolla in 1911.

He entered his father&#x27;s tobacco business, and in 1890 became vice-president of the American Tobacco Company. In 1892, the Duke family opened their first textile business in Durham, North Carolina, with Benjamin Duke at its head.

In 1905, he and his brother James founded the Southern Power Company, which later became known as Duke Energy. The company initially supplied electrical power to the Duke textile factory. Within two decades, their power facilities had been greatly expanded, and they were supplying electricity to more than 300 cotton mills and other industrial companies through an electrical grid that supplied cities and towns in the Piedmont Region of North and South Carolina.

In 1908, he had his half brother Brodie declared incompetent and taken to a sanitarium.

Benjamin Duke and his brother were major contributors to the economic growth of the North Carolina economy and would expand into other areas with sizable investments in railroads and banks.

Benjamin was a primary benefactor of Trinity College after it relocated to Durham in 1892. Over the years, he donated substantial funds for improvements, additions, and scholarships. Between 1926 and 1929, he donated approximately $3,000,000 (more than $30,000,000 in 2005 dollars) to twenty-seven different southern institutions of higher learning.

Today, Duke University offers the Benjamin Newton Duke Scholars program in honor of Benjamin Duke&#x27;s life and philanthropy. &quot;The B.N.,&quot; as it is known on Duke&#x27;s campus, is a full-ride scholarship to Duke University. The B.N. is awarded to students who excel academically and are committed to service and civic engagement. &quot;BNs&quot; must also display empathy, intentionality, imagination, and a commitment to building community. All applying students are considered for the scholarship. In addition to a full scholarship to Duke University and programs within their time at Duke, B.N. Duke Scholars also complete two &quot;summers of service&quot; in which they complete community service projects. One Summer of Service must take place in a low-income community in the Carolinas, and one is carried out in an international location of the scholars&#x27; choice.

Following his death at his home in New York City in 1929, Benjamin Duke&#x27;s remains were brought back to North Carolina for interment with his father and brother James in Memorial Chapel in the Duke University Chapel on the campus of Duke University.

<text>The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class of guided-missile cruisers is a class of warships of the United States Navy, first ordered and authorized in the 1978 fiscal year. It was originally planned as a class of destroyers. However, the increased combat capability offered by the Aegis Combat System and the passive phased array AN/SPY-1 radar, together with the capability of operating as a flagship, were used to justify the change of the classification from DDG (guided-missile destroyer) to CG (guided-missile cruiser) shortly before the keels were laid down for and .

&quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided-missile cruisers are multi-role warships. Their Mk 41 VLS can fire Tomahawk cruise missiles to strike land targets or anti-aircraft SM-2MR/ERs for defense against aircraft or anti-ship missiles. Their LAMPS III helicopters, RUM-139 ASROCs, and sonar systems allow them to perform anti-submarine missions. &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class ships are designed to be elements of carrier strike groups or amphibious ready groups, as well as perform missions such as interdiction or escort. With upgrades to their AN/SPY-1 systems and their associated missile payloads as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, members of this class have also demonstrated proficiency as mobile anti-ballistic missile and anti-satellite platforms.

Of the 27 completed vessels, nineteen were built by Ingalls Shipbuilding and eight by Bath Iron Works (BIW). All but one () of the ships in the class were originally named for noteworthy events in U.S. military history, although a second (originally named &quot;Chancellorsville&quot;) was renamed to in March 2023, and at least twelve share their names with World War II-era aircraft carriers. As of October 2024, 9 ships remain active. Due to the high cost of maintenance and age, the entire class is being progressively retired; the last vessels are scheduled for decommissioning in 2027. Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers will serve as short-term role replacements until the expected commissioning of DDG(X) destroyers in the 2030s.

==History==
The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class was originally ordered as guided-missile destroyers, with the designation DDG-47. Under Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt&#x27;s &quot;high-low mix&quot;, the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;s were intended to be lower-cost platforms for the new Aegis Combat System by mounting the system on a hull based on that of the . They were to complement the much larger and more capable Strike Cruiser (CSGN) comprising the high end, which were expected to act as flagships. However, with the cancelation of the Strike Cruiser as well as the scaled-down CGN-42 (&quot;Virginia&quot;-class cruiser hull) alternative, requirements were transferred to the DDG-47. Flagship capabilities were added to the class, and it was eventually re-designated as guided-missile cruisers, CG-47, to reflect these additional capabilities. The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser went on to form the high end of the fleet, with the later introduction of the forming the low end.

CG-52 onwards were equipped with the Mk 41 vertical launch system. As the Aegis Combat System and the additional cruiser roles added substantial weight to the &quot;Spruance&quot;-derived hull, the design had limited growth potential in terms of weight and power margin. In the 1980s, a design study known as Cruiser Baseline (CGBL) was created to accommodate the capabilities of CG-52 onto a hull with design and construction techniques matching the DDG-51 (&quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer) for improved survivability and weight allowances.

===Proposed early retirement===
Due to Budget Control Act of 2011 requirements to cut the Defense Budget for FY2013 and subsequent years, plans were being considered to decommission some of the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers. For the U.S. Defense 2013 Budget Proposal, the U.S. Navy was to decommission seven cruisers early in fiscal years 2013 and 2014.

By October 2012, the U.S. Navy had decided not to retire four of the cruisers early in order to maintain the size of the fleet. Four &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers, plus 21 &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers, were scheduled to be equipped for anti-ballistic missile and anti-satellite operations.

In March 2019, the Navy proposed decommissioning the six oldest ships, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, &quot;Mobile Bay&quot;, &quot;Antietam&quot;, &quot;Leyte Gulf&quot;, &quot;San Jacinto&quot;, and &quot;Lake Champlain&quot;, in 2021 and 2022, instead of dry-docking them for life-extension maintenance updates as a cost-saving measure. This would not technically be an &quot;early retirement&quot;, as the ships would be at their originally planned 35-year life dates, but they would be able to serve longer with the upgrades. The proposal needed the approval of Congress, which is usually hesitant to approve any actions that would reduce the size of the active combat fleet.

In December 2021, the House approved a bill that would allow the Navy to retire only five &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers versus the Navy&#x27;s request to retire seven.

===Proposed and Scheduled Retirements===
In December 2020, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the following ships were planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve: At this time, the proposed dates were:

In July 2021, the Navy requested to retire seven cruisers in the Fiscal Year 2022, adding &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; (CG-57) to the six listed above. This request only included the Fiscal Year 2022 inactivations rather than the more common list for the next five years:

The final budget passed in December 2021 prohibited the Navy from using any funds &quot;to retire, prepare to retire, inactivate, or place in storage more than 5 guided missile cruisers.&quot; The budget did not specify which cruisers could be retired, and the Navy ultimately chose to retire &quot;Monterey&quot; (CG-61), &quot;Hué City&quot; (CG-66), &quot;Anzio&quot; (CG-68), &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; (CG-72), and &quot;Port Royal&quot; (CG-73).

In April 2022, the Navy requested to retire all 17 remaining cruisers by the end of Fiscal Year 2027. The schedule was as follows:

Both the House and Senate draft budgets explicitly forbid retiring &quot;Vicksburg&quot; by name, as the ship is nearing the end of a modernization as part of the Phased Modernization Program (also known as the 2-4-6 Program). The House budget prohibits the Navy from using any funds &quot;to retire, prepare to retire, inactivate, or place in storage more than four guided missile cruisers.&quot; Until the final budget is passed, all retirement requests are pending.

In November 2024, the Department of the Navy announced that the &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, &quot;Chosin&quot;, and &quot;Cape St. George&quot; would have their service life extended through 2029, following extensive upgrades as part of a modernization program.

===Replacement===

In their 2015 budget request, the Navy outlined a plan to operate eleven cruisers, while the other eleven were upgraded to a new standard. The upgraded cruisers would then start replacing the older ships, which would be retired starting in 2019. This would retain one cruiser per aircraft carrier group to host the group&#x27;s air warfare commander, a role for which the destroyers do not have sufficient facilities. Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers equipped with the Air and Missile Defense Radar provide enhanced coverage, but putting the radar on standard destroyer hulls does not allow enough room for extra staff and command and control facilities for the air warfare commander. Destroyers can be used tactically for air defense, but they augment cruisers that provide command and control in a carrier group and are primarily used for other missions like defending other fleet units and keeping sea lanes open. Congress opposed the plan on the grounds that it makes it easier for Navy officials to completely retire the ships once out of service. The Navy would have to retire all cruisers from the fleet by 2028 if all are kept in service, while deactivating half and gradually returning them into service could make 11 cruisers last from 2035 to 2045. Replacement of the cruisers was repeatedly delayed by funding due to commitment to the , so work on a new cruiser was expected to begin in the mid-2020s and begin fielding by the mid-2030s.

Due to the large overlap in size and capabilities of its guided missile cruisers and destroyers, the Navy eventually coalesced them into a single class of large multi-mission ships with an emphasis on air and missile defense called Large Surface Combatants (LSC); in 2018, the Navy stated that a future LSC would have capabilities of the Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class guided-missile destroyers as a starting baseline while having future growth margins and air defense command and control of the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class. Consequently, the short-term replacement for the first decommissioned cruisers is the Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class starting in the mid-2020s, while the last of the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers and Flights I and II of the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class will be replaced by the DDG(X) program in the early 2030s. The program office was established in June 2021, and design work was contracted starting in February 2022. Despite the designation, the DDG(X) is expected to be considerably larger and at least as capable as the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class.

==Design==
The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser&#x27;s design was based on that of the &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyer. The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class introduced a new generation of guided missile warships based on the Aegis phased array radar that is capable of simultaneously scanning for threats, tracking targets, and guiding missiles to interception. When they were designed, they had the most powerful electronic warfare equipment and the most advanced underwater surveillance system in the U.S. Navy. These ships were one of the first classes of warships to be built in modules, rather than being assembled from the bottom up.

The greater size and equipment on the CG-47-class cruisers increased displacement from 6,900 tons of the DD-963-class destroyers to 9,600 tons of displacement for the heavier cruisers. Aegis cruisers can steam in any ocean and conduct multi-warfare operations anywhere. Some cruisers reported some structural problems in early service after extended periods in extremely heavy seas; they were generally corrected from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. Several ships had superstructure cracks, which were repaired.

These ships&#x27; superstructures were a modification of that on the &quot;Spruance&quot;-class destroyers and were required to support two deck-houses (one forward for antennas forward and starboard), and the aft deck-house housed the aft and port antenna arrays. The later &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class Aegis destroyers are designed from the keel up to carry the SPY-1D radars and have them all clustered together on the forward deckhouse, saving space and weight and simplifying cooling requirements. The radar support equipment is closer together, minimizing cable runs and concentrating support equipment.

Operations research was used to study manpower requirements for the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; class. It was found that four officers and 44 enlisted sailors could be removed from the ship&#x27;s complement by removing traditional posts that had been made obsolete. However, manpower savings achieved by eliminating the very manpower-intensive Mk 26 guided missile system and replacing it with the far more capable and versatile Mk 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) were harder to emulate with the Mk 45 127 mm (5&quot;) gun systems. The Aegis Cruisers are &quot;double-enders&quot; employing two large-caliber guns, one on each end.

===Vertical Launching System===


In addition to the added radar capability, the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class ships built after USS &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot; (CG-51) included two Mark 41 Vertical Launching Systems (VLS). The two VLS allow the ship to have 122 missile storage and launching tubes that can carry a wide variety of missiles, including Tomahawk cruise missiles, Standard Missile -2MR/ER and -6 surface-to-air missiles, Evolved SeaSparrow Missiles surface-to-air missiles, and RUM-139 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) ASROCs. More importantly, the VLS enables all missiles to be on full standby at any given time, shortening the warship&#x27;s response time before firing. The original five ships (&quot;Ticonderoga&quot;, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, and &quot;Thomas S. Gates&quot;) had Mark 26 twin-arm launchers that limited their missile capacity to a total of 88 missiles and could only fire the SM-2MR and RUM-139. After the end of the Cold War, the less capable original five warships were limited to duties close to the home waters of the United States.

A standard VLS loadout for a &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; cruiser as of 2018 is 12 SM-6s, 3 SM-2ERs, 56 SM-2MRs, 12 RIM-162 ESSMs, 10 SM-3s, 32 Tomahawks, and 6 RUM-139s. In addition, &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;s carry 8 Harpoon anti-ship missiles in standalone launchers at the fantail of the ships.

In October 2024, the US Navy reported the successful testing of a prototype Transferrable Reload At-sea Method for replenishment. This method, as performed on USS Chosin, intends to reduce loading time.

===Upgrades===
Originally, the U.S. Navy had intended to replace its fleet of &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided-missile cruisers with cruisers produced as part of the CG(X) missile cruiser program; however, severe budget cuts from the 21st-century surface combatant program coupled with the increasing cost of the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer program resulted in the CG(X) program being canceled. The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers were instead to be replaced by Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers.

All five of the twin-arm (Mk-26) cruisers have been decommissioned. In 2003, the newer 22 of the 27 ships (CG-52 to CG-73) in the class were upgraded to keep them combat-relevant, giving the ships a service life of 35 years. In the years leading up to their decommissioning, the five twin-arm ships had been assigned primarily home-waters duties, acting as command ships for destroyer squadrons assigned to the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic areas.

As of July 2013, two cruisers have completed hull, mechanical, and electrical (HM&amp;E) upgrades, and eight cruisers have had combat systems upgrades. These include an upgrade of the Aegis computational system with new computers and equipment cabinets, the SPQ-9B radar system upgrade introducing an increased capability over only gunfire control, optical fiber data communications and software upgrades, and modifications to the vertical launching system allowing two 8-cell modules to fire the RIM-162 ESSM. The most recent upgrade packages include SM-6 and Naval Integrated Fire Control – Counter Air (NIFC-CA) capability. Another upgrade is improving the SQQ-89A(V)15 sonar with a multi-function towed array. Hull, sonar, radar, electrical, computer, and weapons systems upgrades can cost up to $250 million per ship.

==Service==
===Downing of Iran Air Flight 655===

USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; (CG-49) achieved notoriety in 1988 when, amid a running gun battle with Iranian Revolutionary Guard gunboats, she shot down Iran Air Flight 655, resulting in 290 civilian deaths. The commanding officer of USS &quot;Vincennes&quot;, William C. Rogers III, believed the airliner to be an Iranian Air Force F-14 Tomcat fighter jet on an attack vector, based on misreported radar returns. The investigation report recommended that the Aegis large screen display be changed to allow the display of altitude information on plots and that stress factors on personnel using Aegis be studied.

===Interception of United States satellite USA-193===

On 14 February 2008, the United States Department of Defense announced that USS &quot;Lake Erie&quot; (CG-70) would attempt to hit the dead satellite USA-193 over the North Pacific Ocean just before it would burn up on reentry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 2/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 February 2008, at approximately 22:30 EST (21 February, 03:30 UTC), an SM-3 was fired from &quot;Lake Erie&quot;, which struck the satellite. The military intended that the missile&#x27;s kinetic energy would rupture the hydrazine fuel tank allowing the toxic fuel to be consumed during re-entry. The Department of Defense confirmed that the missile had directly hit the fuel tank.

==Ships in class==
As part of the federal budget, the Navy had originally requested to decommission seven cruisers in the fiscal year 2022 (FY 2022), releasing a schedule of when these ships would be retired, (note that as opposed to calendar years, fiscal years run from 1 October to 30 September). When Congress passed the final budget, they limited that number of retired cruisers to five. Concerns of lawmakers included the number of ships available in the battle force, how fast retired ships could be replaced with new ones, and overall costs. The budget did not specify which ships were to be retired but did specify certain ships that could not be retired due to factors such as expenditures on recent modernization programs.

The table below includes the proposed retirements from the latest budget request for FY 2023. The retirements for the next fiscal year are proposed by the Navy, and they are not official until approved by Congress. Those for the next four years are proposed only and must be requested in that year&#x27;s budget request. Until the final budget is passed, all retirement requests are pending. In November 2024, the Navy announced that &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, &quot;Chosin&quot;, and &quot;Cape St. George&quot; would remain in service into 2029.

<text>James Buchanan Duke (December 23, 1856 – October 10, 1925) was an American tobacco and electric power industrialist best known for the invention of modern cigarette manufacture and marketing techniques, and his involvement with Duke University. He was the founder of the American Tobacco Company in 1890.

==Early life==
James Buchanan Duke, known by the nickname &quot;Buck&quot;, was born on December 23, 1856, near Durham, North Carolina, to tobacco manufacturer, philanthropist, and benefactor of Duke University, Washington Duke (1820–1905), and his second wife, Artelia Roney.

==Business career==
Duke&#x27;s father, Washington, had owned a tobacco company that his sons James and Benjamin (1855–1929) took over in the 1880s. In 1885, James Buchanan Duke acquired a license to use the first automated cigarette making machine (invented by James Albert Bonsack), and by 1890, Duke supplied 40 percent of the American cigarette market (then known as pre-rolled tobacco). In that year, Duke consolidated control of his four major competitors under one corporate entity, the American Tobacco Company, which was a monopoly as he controlled over 90 percent of the American cigarette market. His aggressive business tactics in cutting prices paid to tobacco farmers directly led to the Black Patch Tobacco Wars in 1906–1908.
At the start of the 1900s, Duke tried to conquer the British market as he had done the American, eventually forcing the then divided British manufacturers to merge into the Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland, Ltd (Imperial Tobacco). After two years of intense competition in Great Britain, Imperial Tobacco took the fight to the U.S. market, forcing American Tobacco to look for a settlement. This resulted in an agreement whereby American Tobacco controlled the American trade, Imperial Tobacco controlled the trade in the British territories, and a third, cooperative venture named the British-American Tobacco Company was set up between the two to control the sale of tobacco in the rest of the world.

During this time, Duke was repeatedly sued by business partners and shareholders. In 1906, the American Tobacco Company was found guilty of antitrust violations, and was ordered to be split into four separate companies: American Tobacco Company, Liggett &amp; Myers, R. J. Reynolds, and the P. Lorillard Company. In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an order breaking up the American Tobacco Company&#x27;s monopoly. The company was then divided into several smaller enterprises, of which only the British-American Tobacco Company remained in Duke&#x27;s control.

In 1892, the Dukes opened their first textile firm in Durham, North Carolina, which was run by Buck&#x27;s brother Benjamin. At the turn of the century, Buck organized the American Development Company to acquire land and water rights on the Catawba River. In 1904, he established the Catawba Power Company and the following year he and his brother founded the Southern Power Company, which became known as Duke Power, the precursor to the Duke Energy conglomerate. The company supplied electrical power to the Dukes&#x27; textile factory and within two decades, their power facilities had been greatly expanded and they were supplying electricity to more than 300 cotton mills and other industrial companies. Duke Power established an electrical grid that supplied cities and towns in the Piedmont Region of North and South Carolina. Buck Steam Station in Rowan County, North Carolina, built in 1926, was named for Duke. Lake James, a power-generating reservoir in Western North Carolina, was created by the company in 1928 and also named in Duke&#x27;s honor.

==Personal life==
Duke was married twice, first in 1904 to Lillian Fletcher McCredy (also known as Lillian Nanette Duke). They divorced in 1906 and had no children. In 1907 he married the widow Nanaline Holt Inman, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, Doris, born November 22, 1912. Doris was raised at Duke Farms located in Hillsborough, New Jersey, where her father had worked with landscapers such as James Leal Greenleaf (a member of the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted), and Horatio Buckenham to transform more than of farmland and woodlots into a landscape containing two conservatories, nine lakes, 35 fountains, 45 buildings, many pieces of sculpture, over of stone walls and more than of roadway.

Duke died in New York City on October 10, 1925, and is interred with his father and brother in the Memorial Chapel on the campus of Duke University. He resided at his home, Lynnwood in Charlotte, North Carolina during the last five years of his life. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

===Philanthropy and will===

In December 1924, Duke established The Duke Endowment, a $40 million trust fund (equivalent to $ in ), some of which was to go to Trinity College, which was renamed Duke University in honor of his father. The James B. Duke Library, the main campus library at Furman University, is also named for him because of his philanthropic relationship with the university.

On his death, he left approximately half of his estate to the Duke Endowment, adding another $67 million (equivalent to $ in ) to the trust fund. In the indenture of trust, Duke specified that he wanted the endowment to support Duke University, Davidson College, Furman University, and Johnson C. Smith University; non-profit hospitals and children&#x27;s homes in the two Carolinas; and rural Methodist churches in North Carolina, retired pastors, and their surviving families.

Much of the remainder of Duke&#x27;s approximately $100 million (equivalent to $ in ) estate went to his daughter Doris Duke, who became &quot;the richest girl in the world&quot;. In 1927, Doris sued her mother for control of the family house in Manhattan and won. Doris also successfully sued for control of the Duke Farms estate. Associating Duke Farms with fond memories of her father, Doris Duke made few major changes to the property other than the adaptation of her father&#x27;s Conservatory to create Display Gardens in his honor. These gardens showcased her father&#x27;s extensive sculpture collection and were open to the public from 1964 until closed by her foundation trustees in May 2008.

<text>Basketball Club Žalgiris () commonly known as BC Žalgiris, is a professional basketball club based in Kaunas, Lithuania. They compete domestically in the Lithuanian Basketball League (&quot;Lietuvos krepšinio lyga&quot;) and internationally as a long-term licensed EuroLeague team. Since the 2011–12 season, Žalgiris has played its home games in Žalgiris Arena in the New Town district of Kaunas.

Žalgiris is the most decorated basketball club in the country, having won 24 Lithuanian Basketball League championships, five Soviet Union National League championships (the second most behind CSKA Moscow), and one EuroLeague championship. Many Lithuanian basketball legends have played for Žalgiris throughout the club&#x27;s history, including Arvydas Sabonis, Modestas Paulauskas, and Šarūnas Jasikevičius. Eight of the fifteen Lithuanian basketball players to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) have played for Žalgiris or were part of the Žalgiris youth program at one point in their careers (Arvydas Sabonis, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Donatas Motiejūnas, Mindaugas Kuzminskas, Darius Songaila, Martynas Andriuškevičius, Arnoldas Kulboka, and Ignas Brazdeikis).

The club&#x27;s name commemorates the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War&#x27;s Battle of Žalgiris, also known as the Battle of Grunwald, in which the joint forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland defeated the Teutonic Order in one of medieval Europe&#x27;s largest battles. Žalgiris and Grunwald translate to &quot;green wood&quot; in Lithuanian and German, respectively.

==History==

===1944–1970: Early success===
BC Žalgiris was formed in 1944. In 1944 they played against the Nazi German basketball team. The team was named ASK from 1945 to 1947, after which it was named SKIF from 1947 to 1949. Beginning in 1950, the team was renamed Žalgiris. The team quickly rose to prominence, winning the Soviet Union&#x27;s top-tier USSR Premier Basketball League twice, in 1947 and 1951, as well as multiple domestic Lithuanian championships. In the following years, the team won two silver medals in the USSR league in 1949 and 1952, and four bronze medals from 1953 to 1956. Žalgiris also won the USSR Basketball Cup in 1953. The team at the time was led by Stepas Butautas, Vytautas Kulakauskas, Justinas Lagunavičius, Kazimieras Petkevičius, and later, by Stasys Stonkus and Algirdas Lauritėnas. In the 1960s, the team&#x27;s play declined, and many new young players joined the team, such as Modestas Paulauskas, Romualdas Venzbergas, Henrikas Giedraitis, Algirdas Linkevičius and Sergejus Jovaiša.

===1970–1990: Among the elite in the USSR===
Žalgiris became the dominant club in the Soviet Union and Europe when they added Valdemaras Chomičius and Rimas Kurtinaitis to their roster, along with coach Vladas Garastas. The team won bronze medals in the Soviet Union championship in 1971, 1973, and 1978. In 1980, Žalgiris debuted in the 1980–81 FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Their biggest addition, though, was 17-year-old Arvydas Sabonis, who debuted with the club in 1981 at and grew another in the next couple years. Sabonis soon became known for his versatility, being able to play defense, assist his teammates, shoot three-pointers, and dominate inside the paint.

From 1985 to 1987, Žalgiris won three consecutive Soviet Union National League championships, beating CSKA Moscow (English: Central Sports Club of Army) in the finals in all three years. In 1985, they reached the Saporta Cup final, but lost to FC Barcelona. Despite the loss, Žalgiris participated in EuroLeague the next year as the Soviet Union champions, reaching the finals and losing to rival KK Cibona. Žalgiris was emerging as one of the top clubs in Europe at the time.

In the mid-1980s, the rivalry between Žalgiris Kaunas and CSKA Moscow served as a major inspiration for the Lithuanian national revival, especially when they played in Kaunas Sports Hall. It contributed to the emergence of the Sąjūdis national movement and the re-establishment of state independence. In 1987, however, Žalgiris suffered a setback when star player Sabonis suffered a torn achilles tendon. Three months later, he tore it again, causing him to miss most of the 1987–88 season. That season, Žalgiris won a silver medal, losing to CSKA Moscow in the Soviet League finals. The next season, Žalgiris managed to reach the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-finals and won a silver medal in the Soviet league, losing a dramatic finals to Stroitel Kiev.

Just before the start of the 1989–90 season, Žalgiris lost Sabonis, Kurtinaitis, Jovaiša, Chomičius, and head coach Garastas, as the Iron Curtain, which had barred Lithuanian basketball talent from becoming internationally sought-after, had been lifted. In the 1989–90 season, Žalgiris reached the Clubs Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-finals, where they lost to Real Madrid.

===1990–1999: Domination in the Lithuanian Basketball League and reaching the top of the EuroLeague===
After the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, Žalgiris left the USSR championship. Over the next few seasons, Žalgiris won Lithuanian championships in 1991, 1992, and 1993, and the LKF Cup in 1990. They won their first LKL title in 1994, beating Atletas Kaunas 3–1 in a four-game series. Over the following two years, Žalgiris again dominated LKL tournaments, beating Atletas Kaunas 3–0 in 1995 and 3–2 (after being down 0–2 in the series) in 1996, however, European success lacked the team, as Žalgiris struggled in both the FIBA European League and FIBA European Cup qualifications. In 1996, Žalgiris finally found success participating in the 1995–96 FIBA European Cup when Rimas Kurtinaitis returned to play for his home team - Žalgiris managed to reach the semifinals, though succumbed to the powerful PAOK Thessaloniki in a two game series. In 1997, Žalgiris again won the LKL championship, beating Žemaitijos Olimpas 3–0 in the finals, and reaching round 16 in the Saporta Cup, losing to Paris Basket Racing. Players such as Darius Lukminas, Gintaras Einikis, Kęstutis Šeštokas, Dainius Adomaitis, and Darius Maskoliūnas played for the club during this period, coached by Jonas Kazlauskas.

Žalgiris enjoyed its greatest success as a club during the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons. They were coached by Jonas Kazlauskas with a new generation of Lithuanian talent, including Saulius Štombergas, Dainius Adomaitis, Eurelijus Žukauskas, Tomas Masiulis, and Mindaugas Žukauskas, and experienced foreign players Franjo Arapović and Ennis Whatley. The team defeated Stefanel Milano 82–67 in the 1998 FIBA Saporta Cup final in Belgrade. Saulius Štombergas scored 35 points in the final. Žalgiris also won a fifth-consecutive LKL title, this time against Atletas Kaunas.

In the 1998–99 season, Žalgiris made it to the EuroLeague Final Four for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, and were crowned champions after defeating Olympiacos and Kinder Bologna in the semi-final and the final, respectively. Tyus Edney was named EuroLeague Final Four MVP. Žalgiris also won LKL and North European Basketball League (NEBL) titles that season.

===1999–2004 ===
The year after winning the EuroLeague, Žalgiris suffered one of its worst seasons. The club was eliminated after the group stage in the EuroLeague, finishing third in the NEBL and losing the LKL finals to Lietuvos Rytas for the first time. In the 2000–01 season, the team reached the new EuroLeague playoffs, but lost to AEK. Žalgiris won the LKL championship, beating Lietuvos Rytas 3–2. The 2001–02 season was again disappointing, as the team was eliminated in the EuroLeague after the group stage and lost the LKL championship to Lietuvos Rytas. In the 2002–03 season, they were again eliminated in the EuroLeague playoffs, but achieved the LKL championship, beating Lietuvos Rytas 4–2.

Sabonis became the principal owner of the club in 2003, after playing for many years in the Spanish ACB League and the North American National Basketball Association (NBA). He also played for the club during the 2003–04 season, winning EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP. Žalgiris almost made it to the EuroLeague Final Four, but were stopped by Maccabi Tel Aviv, who tied the game with Derrick Sharp&#x27;s last-second three-pointer at the end of regulation and went on to beat Žalgiris in overtime. The season ended on a high note, as Žalgiris swept Lietuvos Rytas 4–0 in the LKL championship.

===2004–2009: Post-Sabonis era===
After the departure of Sabonis at the conclusion of the 2003–04 season, Žalgiris faced a series of ups and downs. In the 2004–05 season, mainstays Tanoka Beard, Mindaugas Timinskas, Dainius Šalenga, and new addition Robert Pack enabled Žalgiris to have a respectable season. In the EuroLeague, Žalgiris finished the regular season with an 8–6 record, including wins on the road against heavy favorites Maccabi Tel Aviv and FC Barcelona. However, in the Top 16 phase, the team entered a long slump and finished with an 0–6 record. Žalgiris recovered on the domestic front, easily defeating ULEB Cup winner Lietuvos Rytas in the LKL finals with a 4–0 sweep, and also won the inaugural Baltic Basketball League (BBL) championship, beating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals 64–60.

In the 2005–06 season, the team suffered many changes. Mindaugas Timinskas, Dainius Šalenga, and Robert Pack all departed the team, so Žalgiris built a younger team while signing Ed Cota to return. With the emergence of Darjuš Lavrinovič, Žalgiris started the season solidly, finishing the EuroLeague regular season with a 9–5 record. Off-court, Žalgiris had many issues, resulting in a huge slump for the team. They ended the top-16 phase with another 0–6 record and lost both the LKL and BBL titles to Lietuvos Rytas. The lone bright spot became the play of emerging point guard Mantas Kalnietis, who was signed both as a replacement for the released Cota and due to very poor play from new point guard and longtime NBA player Kenny Anderson.

Žalgiris had a new coach for the 2006–07 season, Ainars Bagatskis, but suffered a terrible EuroLeague regular season. After Ainars Bagatskis was replaced by assistant coach Rimantas Grigas and the signing of new point guard DeJuan Collins, Žalgiris won the newly established LKF Cup by beating Lietuvos Rytas. Žalgiris also beat Lietuvos Rytas in the LKL finals.

Before the 2007–08 season, Žalgiris signed longtime EuroLeague player Marcus Brown. Žalgiris also played against NBA teams for the first time. The team had a successful regular season in the EuroLeague, finishing with an 8–6 record, but suffered another disappointment in the top 16, finishing with a 1–5 record. Žalgiris also won the LKF Cup for the second consecutive year, beating Lietuvos Rytas 83–72 in the finals. In the BBL finals, Žalgiris defeated Lietuvos Rytas 86–84 in the finals on a last-second shot by Collins. Žalgiris retained the LKL title, beating Lietuvos Rytas 4–1 in the LKL finals in which Brown was named MVP.

The 2008–09 season started on a very high note, with contract extensions for Jonas Mačiulis and Loren Woods, retaining leader Marcus Brown, and the signing of new point guard Willie Deane, who replaced the departed DeJuan Collins. However, financial difficulties lead to poor play from the team and the firing of coach Grigas, who was replaced by longtime player and assistant coach Gintaras Krapikas. Willie Deane was soon released, in large part due to his poor performance in the EuroLeague, which led to a seven-game losing streak. The team recovered under point guard Mantas Kalnietis, and finished the EuroLeague regular season with a 2–8 record, missing the top 16. Despite growing financial difficulties, and the departure of Loren Woods, the team made the LKL and BBL finals, as well as the LKF Cup finals. Despite this, this was the most Žalgiris could accomplish, as they lost to Lietuvos Rytas. Jonas Mačiulis, who became the team leader during the season, left after the season ended.

===2009–2013: Vladimir Romanov era===
During the 2008–09 season, Žalgiris faced significant financial difficulties. In 2009, Sabonis sold most of his stake to the local Ūkio banko investment group (ŪBIG), headed by Vladimir Romanov, who ended up controlling a 75% stake in the club. Sabonis retained 21.5% ownership of the club, 3% was owned by a minority group, and 0.5% was owned by the Kaunas municipality.

In the 2009–10 season, Romanov became unpopular among Žalgiris fans. After the departures of Jonas Mačiulis and Paulius Jankūnas, the team extended the contract of Marcus Brown and also signed Martynas Pocius, who quickly became one of the best players on the team. The team also re-signed point guard Mantas Kalnietis, who turned down an offer from Benetton Treviso. The team started the season by winning the new BBL Cup against Lietuvos Rytas. However, subsequent poor performances led to head coach Krapikas being replaced by former Lithuanian national team coach Ramūnas Butautas, who led the team to the EuroLeague Top-16 phase with a 3–7 regular season record. After the team entered a slump, Romanov controversially fired Butautas, replacing him with assistant coach and former captain Darius Maskoliūnas. Under Maskoliūnas, Žalgiris came its closest to the EuroLeague Top-8 phase, finishing with a 2–4 record. Žalgiris won back the BBL title by beating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals, but lost the LKL finals to Rytas by 4–3. Romanov fired coach Maskoliūnas during this series, leading to speculation that Romanov had intentionally lost the finals to allow Lietuvos Rytas to qualify for the EuroLeague season. The season is widely considered the most controversial in club history.

Before the 2010–11 season, Žalgiris re-signed Paulius Jankūnas and DeJuan Collins, signed Tomas Delininkaitis, and brought in Serbian coach Aleksandar Petrović as the new head coach. The season began with Žalgiris playing very strongly, but after a slump, Romanov fired Petrović. They qualified for the Top-16 phase only in the final games, with a 5–5 record. After a controversial departure from center Mirza Begić, the slump continued under new coach Ilias Zouros, with a 1–5 record in the Top-16 phase. However, after the recovery of Marcus Brown (who was injured for most of the season), Žalgiris won back the LKF Cup from Lietuvos Rytas and defeated VEF Riga in the BBL finals. In the LKL finals, Žalgiris easily defeated Lietuvos Rytas 4–1, regaining the LKL title for the first time since 2008.

Due to the NBA lockout that impacted the 2011–12 season, Žalgiris signed former Toronto Raptors wing Sonny Weems and former Denver Nuggets point guard Ty Lawson. The team also re-signed long time fan-favorite Marko Popović. and signed longtime Lietuvos Rytas player and former Lithuanian National team captain Robertas Javtokas as center. However, the season started very poorly for Žalgiris. Hoping to end the slump, Romanov fired coach Ilias Zouros and replaced him with former Lietuvos Rytas head coach Aleksandar Trifunović. Despite initial improvement, as the team finishing the EuroLeague regular season with a 4–6 record and a trip to the Top 16, the slump continued and the team&#x27;s EuroLeague season ended quickly. After Ty Lawson left the team, Mantas Kalnietis became a true leader for Žalgiris and played his best season yet. The team slowly recovered, winning the LKF Cup. After being eliminated in the VTB playoffs, Žalgiris made the BBL Final Four, winning against Lietuvos Rytas in the finals despite losing leader Sonny Weems (who was released due to injury) and DeJuan Collins (who was released due to failing a drug test). With very solid play from Marko Popovič and Tomas Delininkaitis, Žalgiris retained the LKL title, defeating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals 4–1. The club had achieved a second consecutive &quot;triple crown&quot; of Lithuanian League, Lithuanian Cup, and Baltic Cup.

For the 2012–13 season, Žalgiris signed Lithuanian national team players Rimantas Kaukėnas, Darjuš Lavrinovič, and Kšyštof Lavrinovič; Unicaja Malaga star Tremmell Darden; and point guard Oliver Lafayette. The season began with Žalgiris winning the newly established LKF SuperCup against Lietuvos Rytas. Early in the season, Mantas Kalnietis left the team and was replaced by Ibrahim Jaaber. Under new coach Joan Plaza, Žalgiris had their best EuroLeague start with five consecutive wins. They finished at the top of their group for the first time in 13 years, with an 8–2 record. In their 76–66 home victory against CSKA Moscow, Žalgiris broke their attendance record, with 15,812 spectators. In January 2013, Jaaber departed from the team for personal reasons and was replaced by Donnie McGrath in February. In the coming months, financial troubles returned to the club, which led to the departure of Darden. The crisis coincided with the ongoing collapse of Ūkio Bankas. The bank&#x27;s main shareholder Vladimir Romanov, who also owned the majority of shares of Žalgiris and was the club&#x27;s president, abruptly left the country and flew to Russia in early March 2013, abandoning his stake in the club. On 20 March 2013, vice president Paulius Motiejūnas was named the team director. Despite the financial and management struggles, Žalgiris finished the Top-16 phase with a 6–8 record, the best in club history, but narrowly missed the playoffs. Žalgiris also won the group phase in the VTB United League. In May, Žalgiris won their third straight LKL title, sweeping Lietuvos Rytas 4–0 in the finals. After winning the LKL title, Žalgiris competed in the VTB United League playoffs, defeating Nizhny Novgorod in the quarterfinals but losing to Lokomotiv Kuban in the semi-finals. Despite the loss, Žalgiris was awarded the bronze medal for the first time since 2010.

===2013–2016: A new direction===

After the loss of team owner Vladimir Romanov and the departure of head coach Joan Plaza, Žalgiris rehired Ilias Zouros as head coach for the 2013–14 season. Žalgiris left the VTB United League because of the changes in the EuroLeague format that meant that the teams who did not qualify for the Top 16 would have a chance to play in the EuroCup playoffs.

Žalgiris signed Justin Dentmon and Šarūnas Jasikevičius to one-year deals. After a poor start to the season, Zouros was fired as head coach and replaced by Saulius Štombergas. Žalgiris made the Top 16 for the fifth consecutive time (with a 5–5 record). However, Žalgiris began to struggle in the LKL. The Top 16 proved to be difficult, with Žalgiris losing many games by 5 points or less (a 2–12 record overall). After a few losses in the LKF Cup and the LKL, Štombergas resigned and was replaced by Gintaras Krapikas as interim head coach. In the last week of Top-16 play at home, Žalgiris beat Spanish champions Real Madrid. Justin Dentmon scored 36 points in that game, the most by a Žalgiris player in modern EuroLeague, and Dentmon also made 74 three-pointers during the season (a EuroLeague record since 2000).

After a loss to Lietuvos Rytas in the final LKL regular season game, Žalgiris entered the playoffs as the fourth seed, the worst in club history. They faced Lietuvos Rytas again in the semi-finals, the first time in 15 years that they did not meet in the final round. Žalgiris advanced to the finals against Neptūnas Klaipėda, taking the series 4–2 and winning their fourth consecutive LKL championship.

During the 2014–15 preseason, Žalgiris made significant changes to the squad, replacing Justin Dentmon with Maalik Wayns, who was in turn replaced by Will Cherry. Žalgiris also signed Darius Songaila from rival Lietuvos Rytas and James Anderson from the NBA. Šarūnas Jasikevičius retired and became an assistant coach, and more young players were brought to the team. Young point guard Lukas Lekavičius was the main bright spot as the team began LKL play. In the EuroLeague, a 5–5 record sent Žalgiris to the top 16 phase where the team finished with a 5–9 record. In February, Žalgiris won the LKF Cup for the first time in three years. Žalgiris finished the LKL regular season in dominating fashion, with 12 straight wins, and they defeated Lietuvos Rytas in the finals. This win was the club&#x27;s fifth consecutive LKL title and their 17th overall.

Žalgiris had a total of seven players who competed in EuroBasket 2015. They finished the off-season by signing Ian Vougioukas at center. Žalgiris finished the 2015–16 EuroLeague regular season with a 5–5 record and qualified for the Top-16 phase for the seventh consecutive season. After a poor start to the Top 16, head coach Krapikas was replaced by Šarūnas Jasikevičius, but injuries to Javtokas and the departure of Kalnietis led the team to a huge slump and a loss to Lietuvos Rytas in the King Mindaugas Cup final. After strong criticism of the team management for not finding a center to replace Javtokas, Žalgiris signed new point guard Jerome Randle. While the EuroLeague season ended with a 2–12 record, a hugely disappointing result, the team later recovered by finishing in 1st place in the LKL regular season over King Mindaugas Cup winner Lietuvos Rytas. Žalgiris defeated Neptūnas Klaipėda in the LKL finals, winning their sixth consecutive LKL title with a 4–1 record.

===2016–present: New EuroLeague format===
In November 2015, the ongoing conflict between FIBA and Euroleague came to a head when FIBA announced the formation of the Basketball Champions League, and courted EuroLeague teams to join their new championship. However, EuroLeague&#x27;s long-term-license teams, such as Žalgiris, decided to stay with the Euroleague Basketball Company.

====2016–17====
Žalgiris&#x27;s preparation for the 2016–17 season began during the 2016 LKL finals, when the club signed point guard Léo Westermann to replace the departing Jerome Randle. After the season, long-time Žalgiris players Siim-Sander Vene and Kaspars Vecvagars left the team, while Žalgiris chose to retain the services of Seibutis and Motum. Head coach Jasikevičius was pursued by FC Barcelona Lassa, but decided to remain with Žalgiris. To correct the previous season&#x27;s lack of a good shooter, Žalgiris signed Kevin Pangos; the team was loaned Augusto Lima from Real Madrid to replace Vougioukas at center. Žalgiris also signed the returning Artūras Milaknis to a 3-year deal. German prospect Isaiah Hartenstein was scheduled to make his professional debut after being signed the previous season. In August, Žalgiris signed Antanas Kavaliauskas, the captain of Lietuvos Rytas who had previously promised to never play for Žalgiris; Kavaliauskas apologized to fans after the signing was announced.

In February, Žalgiris won their first title of the 2016–17 season, winning the King Mindaugas Cup by defeating Lietkabelis Panevėžys in the finals 84–63. Edgaras Ulanovas was named tournament MVP. In the EuroLeague, Žalgiris exceeded expectations with a 10th-place finish (14–16 record), getting a win against defending champion CSKA Moscow and finishing ahead of FC Barcelona Lassa and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Players Brock Motum, Léo Westermann, Edgaras Ulanovas, and Lukas Lekavičius developed strongly, and team captain Paulius Jankūnas played one of his best seasons of his career, leading the team in scoring and rebounding. In the LKL, Žalgiris won the regular season with only a few losses, sweeping their rival Lietuvos Rytas, with the toughest challenge coming from a powerful Lietkabelis squad that contained former Žalgiris players Darjuš and Kšyštof Lavrinovič. In the LKL playoffs, Žalgiris easily advanced to the finals, defeating Lietkabelis for their seventh straight LKL championship, 4–1.

====2017–18====
Prior the 2017–18 season, Žalgiris reached an agreement with club sponsor Avia Solutions Group to guarantee private flights for the team during away games in a refurbished business-class Boeing 737. The off-season work began just a week after winning the LKL championship, when breakout player Brock Motum signed with Anadolu Efes S.K. To replace Motum, Žalgiris signed Aaron White, who had played a season with Zenit Saint Petersburg. Léo Westerman signed with CSKA Moscow, and was replaced by talented guard Vasilije Micić. To replace Seibutis, Žalgiris originally signed Royce O&#x27;Neale, who terminated his deal just weeks later to sign with the Utah Jazz. Žalgiris then signed Axel Toupane to replace him. Because center Robertas Javtokas announced retirement and the loan of Augusto Lima ended, Žalgiris signed Brandon Davies of AS Monaco Basket at the center position. The most-shocking departure came at the end of June, when breakout point guard Lukas Lekavičius signed a contract with Panathinaikos. Needing a new point guard, Žalgiris signed Dee Bost, also of AS Monaco. Coach Jasikevičius also re-signed with Žalgiris, and the retired Javtokas became the new sports director of the team. On September 22, Žalgiris played a game in London against Polski Cukier Toruń, which Žalgiris won 87–61. Žalgiris won the King Mindaugas Cup for the second consecutive year, defeating Lietuvos rytas 81–62 in the finals. Edgaras Ulanovas won the tournament MVP for the second straight year.

In the 2017–18 EuroLeague, Žalgiris was again projected to be one of the worst teams. Žalgiris struggled in the early season before putting together a five-game streak to finish the first round 10–5, tied for third place in the standings. In the second round, Dee Bost was replaced by Beno Udrih. Žalgiris struggled for the first few weeks of the second round, but fought its way to an 18–12 record (sixth place) and qualification for the EuroLeague playoffs for the first time since 2001. The team qualified for the 2018 EuroLeague Final Four after beating Olympiacos in game 4 to clinch a 3–1 series win. The team achieved this despite having the second-lowest budget in the league. Žalgiris lost to Fenerbahçe in the semifinals, 76–67. In the third-place game, Žalgiris faced longtime rivals CSKA Moscow; Žalgiris led by as much as 24 points, but CSKA&#x27;s late-game rally made it so Žalgiris only narrowly won 79–77, achieving third place in the EuroLeague. In the LKL, Žalgiris won the regular season and beat Lietuvos Rytas in the finals with a 4–1 record, earning their eighth consecutive LKL championship. This was the club&#x27;s best season since 1999.

After a near-perfect season, the off-season was difficult. Žalgiris lost its front court as Pangos went to FC Barcelona Lassa and Micič signed with Efes. Žalgiris signed Nate Wolters as the team&#x27;s new point guard. After the departure of Beno Udrih, Žalgiris signed Donatas Sabeckis from Šiauliai, who lead the LKL in assists. Toupane left the team to sign with Olympiacos; to replace him, Žalgiris signed former-teammate Marius Grigonis, who was having a successful career abroad, to a multi-year deal. They also signed talented guard/forward Thomas Walkup. To replace reserve Martynas Sajus, Žalgiris signed Laurynas Birutis, who was loaned to and had a successful season with Šiauliai. Several more reserves, Paulius Valinskas and Gytis Masiulis, were loaned to other LKL teams so that they could gain more playing time. Ulanovas also signed a new contract. Like the previous season, the biggest concern was the future of coach Jasikevičius. Despite offers from other EuroLeague teams and the Toronto Raptors, Jasikevičius remained with Žalgiris, signing a new contract. Former player Tomas Masiulis replaced Darius Songaila in the coaching staff. In September, Žalgiris signed the returning Léo Westermann to fill the point guard spot.

====2018–19====
The newly reformed Žalgiris struggled at the start of the 2018–19 EuroLeague season. Needing another point guard, Žalgiris signed Derrick Walton in October. By December, Žalgiris was in sixth place with a 7–7 record. However, injuries decimated the team. Walton&#x27;s disappointing play led to decreasing playing time and a release in February 2019. Later in February, Žalgiris suffered a loss in the King Mindaugas Cup to Rytas Vilnius, losing the tournament for the first time since 2016 - a disaster for Žalgiris. By the start of March, Žalgiris was 13th in the EuroLeague with a 9–15 record. The team&#x27;s play started to improve when Walkup was pushed to the point guard position to replace Walton, Westermann returned after being injured, and improving play by Thompson led to a six-game winning streak. Their 15–15 record clinched the final spot in the playoffs, with massive away wins over Maccabi Tel Aviv, Olympiakos Piraeus and Real Madrid, . In the EuroLeague playoffs, Žalgiris lost to Fenerbahçe. Žalgiris broke the EuroLeague&#x27;s home attendance record with an average of 14,808 spectators in the Žalgiris Arena. In the 2018–19 LKL season, Žalgiris finished the regular season in first place, and swept the series finals against Rytas, winning the series 3–0, for a ninth consecutive LKL championship.

====2019–20====
During the off-season, many players (including Westermann and Thompson) left the team, with Antanas Kavaliauskas announcing his retirement after a few very successful seasons with Žalgiris. Lukas Lekavičius returned to the team after two seasons in Greece, and Alex Pérez was signed to replace Westermann. Jock Landale and Zach LeDay, of Olympiacos, were signed to complete the front court. Martinas Geben, who had signed a long-term deal the previous summer, earned a spot on the roster after a successful season with Juventus Utena in the LKL, where he was named Season MVP. Coach Jasikevičius remained with the team for one more season. Pérez, however, spent just a few months with Žalgiris, and was released in November due to his weak play. Žalgiris also signed shooting-guard K. C. Rivers in November.

Žalgiris won the King Mindaugas Cup by beating Rytas Vilnius 80–60 in the finals. Ulanovas was named the MVP of the tournament, his fourth MVP award in Lithuanian Cup competitions. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the 2019–20 LKL season was ended prematurely, and with Žalgiris firmly leading the standings, Žalgiris was announced as champions, their 10th consecutive LKL championship. In the 2019–20 EuroLeague, Žalgiris struggled for most of the season, including plummeting to the bottom of the standings, but recovered by February 2020, finishing with a 12-16 record. With the EuroLeague season stopped due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Žalgiris finished in ninth place.

====2020–21====
With the season ending prematurely due to the COVID-19 situation, Žalgiris started their off-season work early. LeDay, Landale, Ulanovas, and Rivers all left the team during the summer, but the biggest departure was of coach Jasikevičius, who left Žalgiris (along with the rest of the coaching staff) and signed with FC Barcelona in July. On July 14, Žalgiris announced the signing of Martin Schiller as the team&#x27;s new head coach. Schiller had previously worked with the Salt Lake City Stars of the NBA G League, and had been named the NBA G League Coach of the Year in 2020. Schiller brought in Arne Woltmann and Tautvydas Sabonis as his assistant coaches, with Evaldas Beržininkaitis being the only person remaining on the team from Jasikevičius&#x27;s old staff. Žalgiris brought in a bevy of new players, but the most surprising signing happened in June when Žalgiris bought out Marek Blaževič, a talented prospect, out of rival squad Rytas Vilnius.

While the expectations for the upcoming season were not promising under Schiller, Žalgiris surprised everyone and stayed in the playoff hunt throughout the 2020–21 EuroLeague season. Despite eventually not making the playoffs, Žalgiris finished the EuroLeague season with a respectable 17–17 record. They won the King Mindaugas Cup and their 11th consecutive LKL final by beating Rytas 3–0.

====2021–22====
In 2021, Žalgiris signed Tyler Cavanaugh, Niels Giffey, Mantas Kalnietis, Josh Nebo, Edgaras Ulanovas, Jānis Strēlnieks, and Emmanuel Mudiay. They also extended their contract with Lukas Lekavičius. Žalgiris lost all five LKL preseason games, playing seemingly worse each game. Žalgiris had a difficult start in the 2021 LKL regular season—while they won all three games, they struggled even against the weakest of teams. After a 0–2 start in the EuroLeague, Žalgiris fired coach Martin Schiller, replacing him with Jure Zdovc. Injuries to players such as Lauvergne and Strelnieks, struggles in the LKL, and disappointing play from projected leaders such as Mudiay resulted in the worst start ever (0–9) for Žalgiris in the Euroleague. In the LKL, a loss to BC Rytas resulted in Žalgiris falling out of first place.

Žalgiris released Mudiay in November, replacing him with point guard Tai Webster, and signed shooting guard Zoran Dragić. The moves backfired—Webster struggled even in the LKL, while Dragič rarely saw playing time and was released by the end of the year. New signees such as Regimantas Miniotas also saw limited playing time. Losses in the Euroleague resulted in Žalgiris attendance falling to record lows. By February, Žalgiris was in last place with a disastrous 4–20 record, but recovered by March 2022, including memorable wins over the Jasikevičius-lead FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, future participants of the Euroleague Final Four, in particular thanks to the return of Joffrey Lauvergne from injury. Žalgiris also won the 2022 King Mindaugas Cup, beating BC Lietkabelis 91–66 in the finals.

Žalgiris was the first team to refuse to play against Russian teams in the EuroLeague (CSKA Moscow, Kazan Unics, and Zenit St. Petersburg) due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even gaining criticism in the Russian press for being one of the reasons Russian teams got disqualified. They finished the EuroLeague season with a memorable 103–98 win against KK Crvena zvezda. Žalgiris finished the EuroLeague season with an 8–20 record, above the disqualified CSKA, UNICS, and Zenit, but still in last place of the eligible teams—their worst EuroLeague finish since the 2015–16 season.

By the start of April, disappointment returned to Žalgiris. Struggles in the LKL resulted in Žalgiris once again falling behind Rytas in the standings, and they ended up finishing behind Rytas in the standings for the first time since the 2013–14 season. Žalgiris replaced Zdovc later in the month, signing Lithuanian national basketball team coach Kazys Maksvytis as their new head coach. The struggles continued under Maksvytis, who failed to find a good lineup or rotation with the existing roster.

In the LKL playoffs, the struggles became even more evident. Žalgiris needed all five games to beat BC Neptūnas in the quarterfinals, narrowly winning the series 3–2. Žalgiris won the first semifinal game against BC Lietkabelis, before losing the next three games – Lietkabelis won the series 3–1. Žalgiris had failed to qualify to the LKL finals for the first time ever, ending their 11-year domination of the LKL and finishing the 2021–22 season with the biggest fiasco in team history. Žalgiris finished the season by winning the LKL bronze medal, beating BC Šiauliai in the consolation round in a 4–0 sweep. To add insult to injury, Rytas went on to win the LKL championship. Jankūnas retired after the season and became the sports director of Žalgiris.

====2022-2023====
After the disastrous 2021–2022 season, Žalgiris overwent a radical overhaul from the previous season. Coach Maksvytis had signed a long-term deal before the absolutely catastrophic ending in the LKL. Webster, Nebo, Blaževič, Miniotas, Milaknis, Strelnieks, Giffey, and Lauvergne all left the team during the summer. Former team captain Paulius Jankūnas remained, as a sporting director, assisting director Paulius Motiejūnas. Only a handful of players, among the key ones Lekavičius and Ulanovas, named team captain after Jankūnas and who signed long-term extensions, remained with the team. One of the biggest problems of the previous season was settled when Žalgiris signed Keenan Evans as the new point guard for the team. Kevarrius Hayes and former Žalgiris player Laurynas Birutis were signed to replace Lauvergne and Nebo as centers, Rolands Šmits was signed as a replacement for Jankūnas. Tomas Dimša, who had signed with Žalgiris as early as 2020, returned to the team. Dovydas Giedraitis, who played an incredible season with BC Lietkabelis, and who was one of the main reasons Lietkabelis beat Žalgiris the previous season, was bought out of his contract in Spain, where he was signed to Estudiantes Madrid, and was loaned to Lietkabelis by his team, and signed a long-term contract with Žalgiris. However, the biggest signings for Žalgiris, for the summer, were Arnas Butkevičius, Rytas captain and one of the most important parts of the Rytas 2022 LKL championship winning team, and Ignas Brazdeikis – former NBA player, standout in college, and who returned to play in Lithuania, both on the national team and for Žalgiris – for the first time since moving to Canada at a young age. Despite solid additions, the awful performances of the previous season haunted the team; while Žalgiris became an instant favorite to regain the LKL crown, in the Euroleague, the team was not even considered to be anywhere near playoff contention, with many experts predicting last place for Žalgiris in the Euroleague.

Despite this, and the fact that head coach Kazys Maksvytis had only a brief experience in the Euroleague (as head coach for Neptūnas Klaipėda in the 2014-2015 season), Žalgiris shocked the Euroleague; led by Evans, Žalgiris fought nearly every team, at home or away, to the deciding seconds, winning most of the matches. Keenan Evans dominated with incredible performances. In December, however, Evans suffered a season-ending achilles tendon injury; at this point, Žalgiris was 9-8 in the first round of the Euroleague, in playoff contention. While many believed this to be the end of Žalgiris&#x27;s good run in the Euroleague, Žalgiris recovered – signing Isaiah Taylor, as the new point guard to replace Evans, and Achille Polonara, both from Efes – before the second round. Brazdeikis, who finally adjusted to the European game after a difficult first half of the season, became team leader, with Ulanovas, Šmits, Hayes, and, after a time of adjusting, Taylor and Polonara all contributing. Butkevičius quickly became a fan favorite for his amazing defence and his hustle, with the former Rytas captain becoming among the most popular players among Žalgiris fans. Mantas Kalnietis, remaining after disastrous season, ended up retiring in February and moving to back-office work with Žalgiris, mostly with the Žalgiris football team. Žalgiris was 15-15 by the start of April, and made an amazing run to the Euroleague playoffs, capped off with wins over Maccabi Tel Aviv at home and FC Bayern Munich away, to reach the playoffs, as the 7th seed, with a 19-15 record and with wins over Fenerbahçe and Baskonia Vitoria. Žalgiris also finished second in attendance, behind KK Partizan, with fans selling out 16 of the 17 home games, starting in October, because of which, the Žalgirio Arena became the host of the Euroleague Final Four tournament. In the Euroleague playoffs, Žalgiris faced off against FC Barcelona, coached by ex-Žalgiris coach Šarūnas Jasikevičius. Despite best efforts, and the fact that Žalgiris had beaten Barcelona in the regular season at home, Barcelona proved too much for Žalgiris, beating them 91-69, 89-81, and 77-66 for a victorious 3-0 sweep. However, the incredible performance of Žalgiris in the Euroleague earned the team a standing ovation in the last game in Kaunas.

Žalgiris won the 2023 edition of the King Mindaugas Cup, their fourth consecutive Cup victory, with Ulanovas once again being named the MVP of the finals. In the LKL, Žalgiris finished first in the regular season, with a win over defending LKL champions BC Rytas in April, and finished with a 28-5 record. In the playoffs, Žalgiris swept BC Nevėžis in the quarterfinals 2-0, to set up a rematch against BC Lietkabelis; this time, Žalgiris beat Lietkabelis 3-1 to avenge the previous season loss, with a satisfying, dominating 95-66 win in Panevėžys in the deciding game. In the LKL finals, Žalgiris faced Rytas, the series going a full five games, with Rytas giving Žalgiris a fight in each game, with Žalgiris beating Rytas in Kaunas, 108-93 and 95-80, but Rytas winning in Vilnius, 94-71 and 69-68, to set up a decisive fifth game in Kaunas. Žalgiris would win the deciding game 97-87, winning the series 3-2, and regaining the LKL championship. Taylor, who scored 32 points in the championship winning game, was named the LKL Finals MVP.

====2023-2024====
After an incredible 2022–2023 season, Žalgiris re-signed much of the team. However, Paulius Motiejūnas, club director since 2013, departed the team and headed to become the director of Euroleague Basketball, a move that many had anticipated during the 2023 season. Paulius Jankūnas took over as club director, in addition to being the sporting director. With Keenan Evans returning from injury, Žalgiris also made an unpopular decision not to re-sign Isaiah Taylor, the MVP of the LKL finals and Žalgiris leader during the victorious series against Rytas. Among other departing players, Tyler Cavanaugh and Karolis Lukošiūnas left during the summer. To replace Taylor, Žalgiris signed Naz Mitrou-Long to the point guard position and also signed Brady Manek, former NCAA standout, to a contract to replace the departed Cavanaugh. With much of the younger Žalgiris players, in particular Motiejus Krivas, departing to the NCAA, Žalgiris also signed Danielius Lavrinovičius, fresh off his career-best season with BC Nevėžis, to a contract.

With what seemed as solid additions during the summer, as well as keeping much of the same roster as the previous 2023 season, Žalgiris looked to continue where they left off the previous season. At the start of the season, however, Žalgiris suffered a massive blow as team leader Ignas Brazdeikis was bought out by Olympiakos Piraeus; the move became even more haunting when Žalgiris decided not to immediately search for Brazdeikis&#x27;s replacement. Despite the departure by Brazdeikis, Žalgiris started the season strong, being undefeated in the LKL and 3-1 in the Euroleague, sparked by the incredible return to form by Keenan Evans. However, by October, the bottom fell out; struggling even in the LKL, Žalgiris completely fell apart in the Euroleague, going into the second round of the Euroleague with a disastrous 2-11 finish in the first. Mitrou-Long struggled as point guard, and by November, was also bought out by Olympiakos. The eventual replacement for Brazdeikis, Edmond Sumner, played too inconsistently to make any difference. Injuries hurt the team, in particular an injury to Arnas Butkevičius, one of Žalgiris top defensive players; his brief replacement, Austin Hollins, had a forgettable stint with Žalgiris. Rumours of Andrea Trinchieri coming in to replace coach Maksvytis began as early as December, followed by a reported player mutiny which resulted in Maksvytis remaining with Žalgiris for the time being. However, the tragic finish in the Euroleague first round, with a 5-12 record, resulted in Žalgiris and Maksvytis mutually parting ways by the end of December; and coach Trinchieri was brought in to replace him.

Under Trinchieri, Žalgiris had a ressurgence; in the second round of the Euroleague, Žalgiris returned to playoff contention, and fought for the final spot of the Euroleague Play-In tournament all the way to April. Laurynas Birutis became one of the best players for Žalgiris, completely overshadowing Kevarrius Hayes and taking over as starting center, and Dovydas Giedraitis became one of the best defensive players, not just for Žalgiris, but in the whole Euroleague. Lead by Evans, Žalgiris fought until April for a spot in the Play-In tournament, before an away loss to AS Monaco ended their hopes for Euroleague playoffs. Under Trinchieri, Žalgiris finished with a 9-8 record, going 14-20 overall. Keenan Evans had incredible performances all season, establishing himself as one of the top guards of the Euroleague.

Žalgiris also won the 2024 King Mindaugas Cup, held in Kaunas, beating BC Wolves in the quarterfinals, BC Šiauliai in the semifinals, and BC Lietkabelis (who had eliminated BC Rytas in the semifinals) in the finals. Laurynas Birutis was named the tournament MVP. In the LKL, for most of the season, Žalgiris dominated, sweeping Rytas in the regular season, to finish with a 26-4 record, with no other team in the LKL coming close to Žalgiris. During the season, it also became clear that Žalgiris greatly relied on Keenan Evans. Žalgiris chose not to search for another point guard after Mitrou-Long departed in November, with only Lekavičius remaining in the spot. Žalgiris also made a dubious decision to re-sign Karolis Lukošiūnas in February, a decision that ended up even more questionable when Lukošiūnas, after playing a few games, was out for the whole season by the end of March. Before the end of the transfer table in the LKL, Žalgiris also signed Demetrie Rivers; while Rivers had some good games for Žalgiris in the LKL, he barely saw any playing time by the playoffs. In the playoffs, Žalgiris beat M-Basket Delamode Mažeikiai 2-0 in the quarterfinals. The semifinals, against BC Lietkabelis, was a nightmare; in the deciding game of the victorious 3-0 Žalgiris sweep to set up a rematch against Rytas, Evans suffered a season-ending injury by rupturing his patellar ligaments. Without Evans, Žalgiris fell apart. With nobody stepping up for Žalgiris in the finals, Rytas took advantage, taking home-court advantage away from Žalgiris, and finishing off the still shocked Žalgiris 3-1 in the LKL finals to regain the LKL title, while ending the already difficult season for Žalgiris in a complete disaster. This win by Rytas over Žalgiris is considered the biggest upset in LKL history.

==Major championships==
At the team&#x27;s inception in 1944, when Lithuania was a Soviet Socialist Republic, Žalgiris began competing in both the Soviet Union National League and the domestic Lithuanian SSR League. When the country declared independence from the USSR in 1991 and the Soviet League folded, Žalgiris competed in the Lithuanian League (a successor of the Lithuanian SSR League) for two years before the newly-reinstated Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF) established the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) as the country&#x27;s premier basketball league in 1993, with Žalgiris as a founding member.

In 2007, the LKF established the LKF Cup (Lietuvos Krepšinio Federacijos Taurė) as an annual tournament for domestic clubs. Before 2007, the LKF Cup had been held twice—once in 1989–90 and once in 1997–89. It was replaced in 2016 by the King Mindaugas Cup, a mid-season tournament for LKL teams that runs from October to February.

==Rivalries==

During the Soviet era, Žalgiris had an intense rivalry with CSKA Moscow, the multiple-time champion and symbol of the Red Army. Their matchups would draw huge crowds in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The rivalry peaked during the 1980s, with the teams meeting in the USSR championship finals six times, which Žalgiris won in 1985, 1986, and 1987. It is considered to be the top rivalry in USSR basketball, as CSKA remains one of the most-hated teams in Kaunas to this day. During the 2000s and 2010s, the teams met many times in the EuroLeague, with CSKA winning most of the matches. In 2018, during the EuroLeague third place match, Žalgiris narrowly defeated CSKA, 79–77. Over the years, the two teams also met in the NEBL, as well as the VTB United League, with the matches drawing huge crowds. In 2012, one such VTB match drew a record attendance of 15,812, a record for the competition and for the Žalgiris Arena.

After the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania and the Independence of Lithuania in 1990, and the establishment of the Lithuanian Basketball League in 1993, Žalgiris had a rivalry with BC Atletas, coached by former-Žalgiris head coach Vladas Garastas, with both teams fighting for the LKL championship. The teams met in the LKL finals four times, with Žalgiris winning each time. Starting in 1998, Žalgiris&#x27;s main rival has been BC Lietuvos Rytas, also known as BC Rytas, from Vilnius. The matches draw the biggest interest in all of LKL, with the teams having met in the finals 17 times, with Žalgiris winning 12 times and Rytas 5. The teams constantly fight for first place in the LKL standings. In the LKF Cup, King Mindaugas Cup, Baltic Basketball League, and the NEBL, Žalgiris wins most of their matchups. During the 2010s, Žalgiris has largely dominated the rivalry, with sweeps in the finals in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2019, and in the regular season in 2017. In the 2018–19 season, Žalgiris swept Rytas in both the regular season and the final series.

<text>A hole punch, also known as hole puncher, or paper puncher, is an office tool that is used to create holes in sheets of paper, often for the purpose of collecting the sheets in a binder or folder (such collected sheets are called loose leaves). A &quot;hole punch&quot; can also refer to similar tools for other materials, such as leather, cloth, or sheets of plastic or metal.

== Mechanism ==

The essential parts of a hole punch are the &quot;handle&quot;, the &quot;punch head&quot;, and the &quot;die&quot;. The punch head is typically a cylinder, with a flat end called the &quot;face&quot;. The die is a flat plate, with a hole matching the head. The head can move, while the die is fixed in place. Both head and die are usually made of a hard metal, with precise tolerances. One or more sheets of paper are inserted between the head and the die, with the flat face of the head parallel to the surface of the sheets. Moving the handle pushes the head straight through the sheets of paper. The hard edge of the punch vs the die cuts a hole in the paper, pushing the cut piece out the bottom of the die. The cut-out bit of paper scrap is called a &quot;chad&quot;.

The handle functions as a lever, decreasing the amount of force the operator needs to apply. The travel distance of the cylinder is generally very short—the thickness of the paper sheets—so the cylinder can be positioned close to the lever . For low-volume hole punches, the resulting lever handle need not be more than long for sufficient force. Hole punches for larger volumes of paper (hundreds of sheets) feature longer lever arms, but function similarly.

There are hole punches which punch patterns of multiple holes at once, typically for binding multiple sheets together (see ). Such punches generally feature two paper guides for alignment. One guide will be along the side of the paper to be punched, and sets the distance of the holes from the edge of the paper (the margin or gutter). The other guide will be on a perpendicular side, and aligns the holes between the top and bottom of the sheet. One or both guides may be adjustable.

On multiple-hole punches, the positions of individual punch heads may also be adjustable. Commonly, one or more punch heads are mounted in independent fittings, which can slide along a rail. A set screw holds each fitting in position. There may be marks on the device to identify standard hole positions. There may be positions where a punch head will not make contact with the activating handle, allowing holes to be &quot;turned off&quot;.

Some punch designs use hollow punch heads (a thin-walled tube), with the edge a sharpened blade. This allows the chads to be pushed up and out the top, as the paper is being cut, making it more suitable for thicker volumes of paper. For very large amounts of paper, a paper drill may be used instead of a punch.

== Applications ==

=== Single-hole punches ===

A single-hole punch makes a single hole per activation, usually at an arbitrary position (i.e., without alignment guides).

Single-hole punches are often used to punch an admission ticket or other document to indicate it has been used or processed. A specialized ticket punch may be used for this purpose. Some ticket punches have a longer reach/depth (allowing for a particular spot on the ticket to be punched), or punch a particular shape instead of a round hole.

Single-hole punches are often used to punch holes through old playing cards at casinos, marking them as &quot;used&quot; or &quot;canceled&quot;. This helps cut down on cheating by eliminating any cards that may have been tainted by players.

Single-hole punches are widely used in the British Civil Service where papers are punched with a single hole in the upper left, and secured using a treasury tag.

Single-hole punches can also be used for binding, with a single loose binding ring, although this is much less common than with ring binders.

Single-hole punches can also be used to make confetti for scrapbooks and other crafting.

==== Eyelet punch ====

A related office tool is the eyelet punch. This is a single-hole punch which also crimps a metal fastening loop around the hole, similar to a rivet. It is used to permanently secure a few sheets of paper together.

A similar tool, generally known as a holing pincer, is used in animal husbandry. A common application is to attach an ear tag to a livestock animal.

==== Paper tape repair punch ====
Specialized hand-operated tape punches were used to perform small edits and repairs on punched paper tapes used for data entry into teletypes or early computers. Torn or damaged tapes were sometimes aligned with specialized jigs, spliced with special adhesive tape, and the holes encoding data were manually restored using such punches. The ASCII character code included a special DELETE or DEL character defined as all holes punched out (code 7F), allowing an erroneous character to be canceled by punching extra holes.

As punched tape technology became obsolescent in the 1980s, the manual tape repair tools became rare.

=== Multiple-hole punches ===
Multiple-hole punches typically place a pattern of holes along one edge of sheets of paper, allowing the pages to be bound together.

The most common use for multi-hole punched paper is with a ring binder. A book-like cover is fitted with retaining rings matching the pattern of the punched holes. The rings may be split open, paper sheets threaded onto them, and then the rings closed again.

A variety of hole patterns are in use for ring bindings. In much of the world, two-hole and four-hole punches consistent with ISO 838 are the norm. In the US, the three-hole punch is most common. See .

There are other binding techniques which use hole punching. Coil binding uses a spring-like coil, threaded into the punched holes. Comb binding uses a plastic strip with &quot;fingers&quot; that clip into the punched holes. Both use their own types of specialized hole punches. Comb binding typically punches 19 or 23 rectangular holes (for letter and A4 paper sizes, respectively).

==== Hole punch for discbound notebooks ====
A hole punch does not necessarily make round or square holes in a sheet of paper; instead, it may create certain shapes along the edge of the sheet. This is seen in discbound notebook systems, where loose leaves are bound together using plastic discs. For more information on loose leaf systems, see Loose leaf.

== History ==
The origins of the hole punch date back to Germany; Friedrich Soennecken filed his patent on 14 November 1886, for his , a multiple-hole punch and office supply product. A Google Doodle was used on 14 November 2017 to celebrate the 131st anniversary of the hole punch.

The first record for a single-hole puncher—a ticket punch—was published in 1885, when Benjamin Smith helped create a spring-loaded hole puncher that had a receptacle to collect the chads. Smith dubbed it the &quot;conductor&#x27;s punch&quot;. A later paper punch was refined in 1893 by Charles Brooks, and it was referred to as a ticket punch due to its early role in punching train tickets as trains became increasingly popular and common between 1850 and 1900.

== Standards ==
Multiple standards exist for the number and position of holes on multi-punched sheets.

=== International ===

==== ISO 838 ====

International Standard ISO 838 specifies two holes, with centers apart, and located from the nearest edge of the paper, and with the pair of holes positioned symmetrically along that edge. Each hole is to have a diameter of . Any paper format that is at least 100 mm high can be filed using this system (e.g., ISO A7 and larger). A printed document with a margin of 20–25 mm will accommodate ISO 838 filing holes.

==== 4-hole or 888 ====
A four-hole extension to ISO 838 is also in common use. Two holes are punched in accordance with the standard, plus two additional holes located 80 mm to the outside of the standard holes. The two additional holes provide more stability in 4-ring binders, while still allowing 4-hole paper to fit 2-ring binders. This extension is sometimes referred to as the &quot;888&quot; system because of the three 8 cm gaps between the holes. (NB: Referring to this de-facto standard as &quot;ISO 888&quot; is inaccurate, since the actual ISO 888 standard concerns fasteners, not holes in paper.) Some 2-hole punches have an &quot;888&quot; marking on their paper guide, to assist punching all four holes into A4 paper.

Konica Minolta specifies that for European 4-hole arrangements, all holes should be from the nearest (i.e. long/spine) edge of the paper, which is slightly at variance with ISO 838&#x27;s specification of .

=== ANSI paper sizes ===
The United States and a few other countries use non-ISO paper standards, defined in ANSI/ASME Y14.1 and other intra-nation standards. Unlike ISO 838, there appears to be no well-established official specification for ANSI paper hole patterns, and instead they are de facto standards, established by custom and tradition.

The diameter of the holes varies between manufacturers, with typical values being . The value is most commonly used, as it allows for looser tolerances in both ring binder and paper punching. The distance to the paper edge also varies, with hole-center-to-edge being typical. Konica-Minolta specifies for both two and three-hole variants in North America.

==== US letter 3-hole system ====
For the US letter paper size (), a three-hole standard is widely used. The holes are positioned symmetrically, with the centers apart. It requires paper formats that are at least high. There is a variant for half-letter size pages (), whose three holes are apart.

==== US legal 4-hole system ====
For US legal paper size (), a 
4-hole system exists. It is still in use today, but is not as common as the 3-hole standard. The four holes are positioned symmetrically with centers apart. The four binding positions provide more support for the longer 14-inch side of legal paper.

==== 2-hole filebinder ====

Another standard also occasionally used in the US is a &quot;filebinder&quot; system. Its two holes are positioned symmetrically, each apart from the center, i.e. apart from each other. This matches the half-letter 3-hole system, except that the middle hole is omitted.

=== Swedish triohålning ===

In Sweden, a four-hole national standard is almost exclusively used. The centers of the holes are , and apart, from the edge of the paper. The guides help keep the paper in a straight line.

The official name of this four-hole system is &quot;triohålning&quot;, since it was adapted to the &quot;Trio binder&quot; which was awarded Swedish patent in 1890. The binder&#x27;s inventor, Andreas Tengwall, supposedly named it after a consortium consisting of himself and two companions, i.e. a trio. The binder can be opened at any place while holding the papers in place, as the inner holes have guide pins from one side, the outer holes have pins from the other side.

=== Others ===
* The Filofax system uses six holes in two groups of three.

<text>Washington Duke (December 18, 1820 – May 8, 1905) was an American tobacco industrialist and philanthropist. During the American Civil War he enlisted in the Confederate States Navy. In 1865, Duke founded the W. Duke, Sons &amp; Co., a tobacco manufacturer that would be merged with other companies to form conglomerate American Tobacco Company in 1890.

==Early life and Civil War==
Washington Duke was born on December 18, 1820, in eastern Orange County, North Carolina, in what is today the township of Bahama in Durham County. The eighth of ten children of Taylor Duke (c. 1770 – 1830) and Dicey Jones (born c. 1780), Washington worked as a tenant farmer until he married Mary Caroline Clinton (1825–1847) in 1842. At the time of their marriage, his father-in-law gave the couple 72 acres of land located in what is today Durham County. It was on this land that he began his career as a subsistence farmer. The couple had two sons: Sidney Taylor Duke (1844–1858), and Brodie Leonidas Duke (1846–1919). Mary Duke died in 1847 at the age of 22.

In 1852, Duke built a homestead for his second wife, Artelia Roney (1829–1858), who was from Alamance County, North Carolina. It still exists. Artelia gave birth to three children between 1853 and 1856: daughter Mary Elizabeth Duke (1853–1899), and sons Benjamin Newton Duke and James Buchanan Duke (the latter more commonly known as &quot;Buck&quot;). In 1858, oldest son Sidney caught typhoid fever and died. Artelia, who had been caring for Sidney, also succumbed to the illness ten days later.

Very little is known about Duke&#x27;s antebellum views on politics. It is known that Duke owned one slave, named Caroline, whom he purchased for $601, and had hired out the labor of another slave from his neighbors to work on his farm.

At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Duke was 40 years old, too old for the initial conscription into service for the Confederacy. However, the second Confederate Conscription Act passed in September 1862 increased the draft-eligible age to 45. Duke, aware that he would soon be called into military service, held a sale at his home on October 20, 1863, to sell the entirety of his farm equipment. He enlisted in the Confederate navy, and served in Charleston, South Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia, until his capture by Union forces in April 1865. After a brief stint in a Federal prison, he was paroled and was sent by ship to New Bern, North Carolina, and from there, walked 134 miles (216 km) back to his homestead.

==Tobacco career==

After the war, Duke stopped farming in order to focus on manufacturing tobacco products. In 1865, using a converted corn crib as a factory, Duke started his first company, W. Duke and Sons, and began production of pipe tobacco under the brand name Pro Bono Publico (For the Public Good). According to Duke, he, along with his sons Ben and Buck, produced between 400 and 500 pounds of pipe tobacco per day. As their company prospered, they built a two-story factory on the homestead in 1869. In 1874, Washington Duke sold his farm and moved his family into the rapidly growing city of Durham. He and his sons built a factory on Main Street, and Washington spent the rest of the decade as a traveling salesman for Pro Bono Publico.
In 1880, at the age of 60, Washington Duke sold his share in the business to Richard Harvey Wright, a farmer from nearby Franklin County. W. Duke, Sons &amp; Co., led by Washington Duke&#x27;s son Buck as president, eventually achieved great success as a manufacturer of cigarettes. This business became the American Tobacco Company around 1890. Through merging multiple partners and through floating stock, the company became the largest tobacco manufacturer in the world.

After selling his share in the company, Washington Duke became more involved with local politics as a member of the Republican Party, and devoted more time to charitable and philanthropic works. A lifelong member and supporter of the Methodist church, Duke began to support local churches financially, as well as institutions of higher learning. Duke helped to bring Trinity College, a Methodist college, to Durham from Randolph County in 1890. In 1896 while Trinity College was struggling financially, Duke donated $100,000 to the institution on the condition that it &quot;open its doors to women, placing them on equal footing with men.&quot; In appreciation, the school offered to rename itself after Duke, which he declined.

Washington Duke died at his home in Durham on May 8, 1905, at the age of 84. Originally interred at Maplewood Cemetery in Durham, he was later re-interred in the Memorial Chapel within the Duke University Chapel. In the 1910s, members of the Duke family began to plan what would become the Duke Endowment of Trinity College. After the indenture for the $40,000,000 was signed in December 1924 by Washington&#x27;s youngest son, James B. Duke, Trinity College renamed itself Duke University in honor of Washington Duke, in accordance with the terms of the indenture. Today, a statue of Washington Duke sits on Duke University&#x27;s East Campus.

<text>Renato Dulbecco ( , ; February 22, 1914 – February 19, 2012) was an Italian–American virologist who won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on oncoviruses, which are viruses that can cause cancer when they infect animal cells. He studied at the University of Turin under Giuseppe Levi, along with fellow students Salvador Luria and Rita Levi-Montalcini, who also moved to the U.S. with him and won Nobel prizes. He was drafted into the Italian army in World War II, but later joined the resistance.

==Early life==
Dulbecco was born in Catanzaro (Calabria, Southern Italy), but spent his childhood and grew up in Liguria, in the coastal city Imperia. He graduated from high school at 16, then moved to the University of Turin. Despite a strong interest in mathematics and physics, he decided to study medicine. At only 22, he graduated in morbid anatomy and pathology under the supervision of professor Giuseppe Levi. During these years he met Salvador Luria and Rita Levi-Montalcini, whose friendship and encouragement would later bring him to the United States. In 1936 he was called up for military service as a medical officer, and later (1938) discharged. In 1940 Italy entered World War II and Dulbecco was recalled and sent to the front in France and Russia, where he was wounded. After hospitalization and the collapse of Fascism, he joined the resistance against the German occupation.

==Career and research==
After the war he resumed his work at Levi&#x27;s laboratory, but soon he moved, together with Levi-Montalcini, to the U.S., where, at Indiana University, he worked with Salvador Luria on bacteriophages. In the summer of 1949 he moved to Caltech, joining Max Delbrück&#x27;s group (see Phage group). In the early 1950s, on Delbruck&#x27;s advice, Dulbecco visited the major centers of animal virus work in the US in order to discover a way to quantitatively assay animal viruses by a plaque technique, similar to the technique that had recently been developed for bacterial viruses. Within less than a year, he worked out such a method for Western equine encephalitis virus, which then opened up animal virology to quantitative work. The technique was then used by Dulbecco and Vogt to study the biological properties of poliovirus. These accomplishments led to Dulbecco&#x27;s appointment first to associate professor, and then to full professor at the California Institute of Technology. There he started his studies about animal oncoviruses, especially of polyoma family. In the late 1950s, he took Howard Temin as a student, with whom, and together with David Baltimore, he would later share the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for &quot;their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumour viruses and the genetic material of the cell.&quot; Temin and Baltimore arrived at the discovery of reverse transcriptase simultaneously and independently from each other; although Dulbecco did not take direct part in either of their experiments, he had taught the two methods they used to make the discovery.

Throughout this time he also worked with Marguerite Vogt. In 1962, he moved to the Salk Institute and then in 1972 to The Imperial Cancer Research Fund (now named the Cancer Research UK London Research Institute) where he was first appointed associate professor and then full professor. Like many Italian scientists, Dulbecco did not have a PhD because it did not exist in the Italian higher education system (until it was introduced in 1980). In 1986 he was among the scientists who launched the Human Genome Project. From 1993 to 1997 he moved back to Italy, where he was president of the Institute of Biomedical Technologies at C.N.R. (National Council of Research) in Milan. He also retained his position on the faculty of Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Dulbecco was actively involved in research into identification and characterization of mammary gland cancer stem cells until December 2011. His research using a stem cell model system suggested that a single malignant cell with stem cell properties may be sufficient to induce cancer in mice and can generate distinct populations of tumor-initiating cells also with cancer stem cell properties. Dulbecco&#x27;s examinations into the origin of mammary gland cancer stem cells in solid tumors was a continuation of his early investigations of cancer being a disease of acquired mutations. His interest in cancer stem cells was strongly influenced by evidence that in addition to genomic mutations, epigenetic modification of a cell may contribute to the development or progression of cancer.

===Nobel Prize===
Dulbecco and his group demonstrated that the infection of normal cells with certain types of viruses (oncoviruses) led to the incorporation of virus-derived genes into the host-cell genome, and that this event lead to the transformation (the acquisition of a tumor phenotype) of those cells. As demonstrated by Temin and Baltimore, who shared the Nobel Prize with Dulbecco, the transfer of viral genes to the cell is mediated by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (or, more precisely, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase), which replicates the viral genome (in this case made of RNA) into DNA, which is later incorporated in the host genome.

Oncoviruses are the cause of some forms of human cancers. Dulbecco&#x27;s study gave a basis for a precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which they propagate, thus allowing humans to better fight them. Furthermore, the mechanisms of carcinogenesis mediated by oncoviruses closely resemble the process by which normal cells degenerate into cancer cells. Dulbecco&#x27;s discoveries allowed humans to better understand and fight cancer. In addition, it is well known that in the 1980s and 1990s, an understanding of reverse transcriptase and of the origins, nature, and properties of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, of which there are two well-understood serotypes, HIV-1, and the less-common and less virulent HIV-2), the virus which, if unchecked, ultimately causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), led to the development of the first group of drugs that could be considered successful against the virus, the reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, of which zidovudine is a well-known example. These drugs are still used today as one part of the highly-active antiretroviral therapy drug cocktail that is in contemporary use.

===Other awards===
In 1965 he received the Marjory Stephenson Prize from the Society for General Microbiology. That same year, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1973 he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Theodore Puck and Harry Eagle. Dulbecco was the recipient of the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology from the National Academy of Sciences in 1974. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1974. In 1993, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

<text>John Haberle (1856–1933) was an American painter in the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; (literally, &quot;fool the eye&quot;) style. His still lifes of ordinary objects are painted in such a way that the painting can be mistaken for the objects themselves. He is considered one of the three major figures—together with William Harnett and John F. Peto—practicing this form of still life painting in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th century.

==Early life and training==
Haberle was born in 1856 in New Haven, Connecticut, and was the son of Swabian immigrants. At the age of 14 he left school to apprentice with an engraver. He also worked for many years as an illustrator and exhibit preparator for the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, working under the supervision of the paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. Haberle began taking classes at the National Academy of Design in New York City in 1884, where he first encountered &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting.

==Career==
Haberle&#x27;s style is characterized by a meticulous rendering of two-dimensional objects. He is especially noted for his depictions of paper objects, including currency. Art historian Alfred Frankenstein has contrasted Haberle&#x27;s work with that of his contemporaries:Peto is moved by the pathos of used-up things. Haberle is wry and wacky, full of bravado, self-congratulating virtuosity, and sly flamboyance. He works largely within an old tradition, that of the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; still life in painted line ... It is poles away from Harnett&#x27;s sumptuosity, careful balances, and well-modeled volumes, and is equally far from Peto&#x27;s sensitivity in matters of tone and hue.

&quot;A Bachelor&#x27;s Drawer&quot; (1890–1894) is typical of his approach: various papers, including currency, postage stamps, photos, playing cards, tickets, and newspaper clippings, are shown affixed to an essentially planar surface. Other objects—eyeglasses, a comb, a pipe, matches, and so on—are shallow enough in volume so as not to spoil the illusion.

Like Harnett, he was warned by the Secret Service to cease and desist painting paper money, but he continued to do so throughout his years of greatest productivity; examples include &quot;The Changes of Time&quot; (1888) and &quot;Can You Break a Five?&quot; (c. 1885). He painted other subjects such as &quot;Slate&quot; (c. 1895), a bin of peanuts in &quot;Fresh Roasted&quot; (1887), &quot;The Clay Pipe&quot; (1889), and the huge &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Hearthstone&quot; (1890), in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts.

Over the course of his career, Haberle exhibited work at art institutions such as the National Academy of Design in New York and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Due to the popular appeal of Haberle&#x27;s style and subject matter, his work was also shown in venues not conventionally known for displaying art, such as bookstores, saloons, liquor stores, and hotels.

By 1893, eye problems caused Haberle to move away from making detailed work, although he continued to paint. Among his later works are paintings of flowers executed in a looser style, and in 1909 he painted his final &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, the large &quot;Night&quot;, in the collection of the New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, Connecticut. Haberle died in 1933 in New Haven, Connecticut, and was then interred at New Haven&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery.

<text>Charles William Duncan Jr. (September 9, 1926 – October 18, 2022) was an American businessman, administrator, and politician best known for serving as U.S. Secretary of Energy in the Cabinet of President Jimmy Carter from 1979 to 1981. He had previously served as Carter&#x27;s United States Deputy Secretary of Defense during the Iranian Revolution. Earlier, Duncan had run the family business, Duncan Coffee Company of Houston, Texas, for seven years, until the Coca-Cola Company acquired it in 1964. After seven years on the Coke board, Duncan became the corporation&#x27;s president.

== Early years ==
Duncan was born on September 9, 1926, in Houston, Texas. He was the older of two children. Duncan prepped at the Sewanee Military Academy in Sewanee, Tennessee, and served two years in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. He graduated from Rice University in 1947 with a degree in chemical engineering. Duncan also pursued two years of graduate work in business administration at the University of Texas and worked briefly as a roustabout and chemical engineer for Humble Oil and Refining Corporation (now Exxon).

== Duncan Coffee Company ==
In 1957, Duncan joined his family&#x27;s coffee business, which had been founded by his uncle and father in 1918. Duncan Coffee&#x27;s early brands, notably Admiration and Bright &amp; Early, had become grocery staples in Texas and surrounding states. Duncan rose steadily through the ranks and attained the presidency in 1958. Under his leadership, the company expanded into the production of instant coffee—a new and popular beverage—by acquiring plants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Duncan also acquired several regional brands of ground coffee, including Butternut Foods of Nebraska and Fleetwood Coffee of Tennessee. He developed Maryland Club Coffee, which was marketed as a premier, upscale blend rivaling Maxwell House.

== The Coca-Cola Company ==
On May 8, 1964, Duncan Coffee merged with the Coca-Cola Company, and Duncan joined the Coke board of directors. He ran the newly formed Coca-Cola Foods Division, which included the coffee and citrus (Minute Maid) divisions of Coke. Three years later the company dispatched him to London to serve as chairman of Coca-Cola Europe. There Duncan supervised the operation and expansion of almost 300 Coca-Cola bottling plants throughout Europe and Asia, including ones in Eastern Europe, Southwest Asia, and North Africa. The first Eastern Europe introduction into Bulgaria made the Coca-Cola Company the first U.S. consumer marketing company to penetrate the Iron Curtain.

In 1970, Duncan returned to Atlanta and the following year became Coca-Cola&#x27;s president. During his tenure from 1971 to 1974, the company enjoyed extensive growth. It also modernized its advertising. During this period Duncan bought the TE Ranch, southwest of Cody, Wyoming—a working cattle ranch established in 1895 by William F. &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody, from Coca-Cola&#x27;s R. W. Woodruff. In 1974, Duncan left Coca-Cola to head back to Houston, where he became the chairman of both Rotan Mosle Financial Corp. and Robertson Distribution Systems.

== Carter administration ==
Charles Kirbo, an advisor to Jimmy Carter, recommended Duncan to Carter for a position in his presidential administration. Carter nominated Duncan to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense. In the role, Duncan advocated to U.S. Congress to end the prohibition of women in combat. The Iranian Revolution occurred during his tenure, encompassing political changes that marked that nation&#x27;s transformation from a monarchy under the pro-western Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to a so-called republic under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Duncan&#x27;s duties involved multiple trips to several countries, including Iran, some of which were undergoing considerable turmoil. Duncan&#x27;s military advisor was a young colonel named Colin Powell, who considered Duncan a mentor and good friend.

In July 1979, President Carter nominated Duncan to succeed James Schlesinger as Secretary of Energy. The appointment drew some criticism, as Duncan had little experience in the oil business, but he developed the reputation of a strong manager. The experience strengthened Duncan&#x27;s belief in conservation measures of all kinds, in addition to enhancing production. Duncan imposed quotas on oil imports, encouraged weatherization of homes, and obtained subsidies for gasohol, helping to mitigate the worst impacts of the energy shortage.

== Corporate and state service ==
Leaving Washington DC at the end of Carter&#x27;s term, Charles Duncan again returned to Houston, in January 1981. There he founded—with his brother, John H. Duncan—Gulf Partners, a private investment firm. He also served on the boards of The Coca-Cola Company, J. P. Morgan Chase, Texas Eastern, American Express, United Technologies, and more. Duncan also served as Limited Partner of Houston NFL Holdings, LP and as treasurer and director of The Methodist Hospital. Additionally, he was a director of The Welch Foundation until October 2004. At the request of Texas Governor Mark White and billionaire politician Ross Perot, Duncan joined the Select Committee on Public Education, and the Texas State Board of Education. The board formulated the controversial &quot;no pass no play&quot; rule, requiring athletes to maintain passing grades in all academic classes.

== Rice University ==
Throughout his career, Duncan repeatedly served as a trustee on the Board of Governors of Rice University. From 1982 to 1996, he served as chairman of Rice&#x27;s board. He twice led the search for a university president, lobbied for the recruitment of international students, and helped establish the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, a nonpartisan think-tank. When Duncan retired from the Rice board, the school named its new computational engineering building &quot;Anne and Charles Duncan Hall&quot; in honor of him and his wife in 1996. In 2007 the couple marked their fiftieth wedding anniversary in June and then—in October—donated $30 million to Rice to establish Duncan College, the university&#x27;s eleventh residential college and its first-ever all-green building. This was part of Rice&#x27;s Vision for the Second Century, which included establishing new residential colleges to accommodate the need to expand the student body while keeping the characteristics that make Rice distinctive.

== Later projects ==
Duncan (in partnership with his son Charles W. Duncan III) latterly oversaw the diverse operations of Duncan Capital Management in Houston. Duncan also served on the board of trustees of the education non-profit Reasoning Mind.

== Personal life ==
Duncan and his wife, Anne (née Smith), had two children. 

Duncan died at his home in Houston on October 18, 2022, from complications of a fall, at age 96.

<text>In the United States, fugitive slaves or runaway slaves were terms used in the 18th and 19th centuries to describe people who fled slavery. The term also refers to the federal Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and 1850. Such people are also called freedom seekers to avoid implying that the enslaved person had committed a crime and that the slaveholder was the injured party.

Generally, they tried to reach states or territories where slavery was banned, including Canada, or, until 1821, Spanish Florida. Most slave laws tried to control slave travel by requiring them to carry official passes if traveling without an enslaver.

Passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased penalties against runaway slaves and those who aided them. Because of this, some freedom seekers left the United States altogether, traveling to Canada or Mexico. Approximately 100,000 enslaved Americans escaped to freedom.
==Laws==

Beginning in 1643, slave laws were enacted in Colonial America, initially among the New England Confederation and then by several of the original Thirteen Colonies. In 1705, the Province of New York passed a measure to keep bondspeople from escaping north into Canada.
Over time, the states began to divide into slave states and free states. Maryland and Virginia passed laws to reward people who captured and returned enslaved people to their enslavers. Slavery was abolished in five states by the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787. At that time, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island had become free states.

===Constitution===
Legislators from the Southern United States were concerned that free states would protect people who fled slavery.
The United States Constitution, ratified in 1788, never uses the words &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;slavery&quot; but recognized its existence in the so-called fugitive slave clause (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3), the three-fifths clause, and the prohibition on prohibiting the importation of &quot;such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit&quot; (Article I, Section 9).

===Fugitive Slave Act of 1793===
The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 is the first of two federal laws that allowed for runaway slaves to be captured and returned to their enslavers. Congress passed the measure in 1793 to enable agents for enslavers and state governments, including free states, to track and capture bondspeople. They were also able to penalize individuals with a $500 () fine if they assisted slaves in their escape. Slave hunters were obligated to obtain a court-approved affidavit in order to apprehend an enslaved individual, giving rise to the formation of an intricate network of safe houses commonly known as the Underground Railroad.

===Fugitive Slave Act of 1850===
The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, part of the Compromise of 1850, was a federal law that declared that all fugitive slaves should be returned to their enslavers. Because the slave states agreed to have California enter as a free state, the free states agreed to pass the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Congress passed the act on September 18, 1850, and repealed it on June 28, 1864. The act strengthened the federal government&#x27;s authority in capturing fugitive slaves. The act authorized federal marshals to require free state citizen bystanders to aid in the capturing of runaway slaves. Many free state citizens perceived the legislation as a way in which the federal government overstepped its authority because the legislation could be used to force them to act against abolitionist beliefs. Many free states eventually passed &quot;personal liberty laws&quot;, which prevented the kidnapping of alleged runaway slaves; however, in the court case known as &quot;Prigg v. Pennsylvania&quot;, the personal liberty laws were ruled unconstitutional because the capturing of fugitive slaves was a federal matter in which states did not have the power to interfere.

Many free state citizens were outraged at the criminalization of actions by Underground Railroad operators and abolitionists who helped people escape slavery. It is considered one of the causes of the American Civil War (1861–1865). Congress repealed the Fugitive Acts of 1793 and 1850 on June 28, 1864.

===State laws===
Many states tried to nullify the acts or prevent the capture of escaped enslaved people by setting up laws to protect their rights. The most notable is the Massachusetts Liberty Act. This act was passed to keep escaped slaves from being returned to their enslavers through abduction by federal marshals or bounty hunters. Wisconsin and Vermont also enacted legislation to bypass the federal law. Abolitionists became more involved in Underground Railroad operations.

==Pursuit==
===Evasion===
In order to throw off the tracking dogs off the trail, escaped slaves rubbed turpentine on their shoes, or scattered &quot;soil from a graveyard&quot; on their tracks. Another technique for scent masking was the use of wild onions or other pungent weeds. 

===Advertisements and rewards===

Enslavers were outraged when an enslaved person was found missing, many of them believing that slavery was good for the enslaved person, and if they ran away, it was the work of abolitionists, with one enslaver arguing that &quot;They are indeed happy, and if let alone would still remain so&quot;. (A new name was invented for the supposed mental illness of an enslaved person that made them want to run away: drapetomania.) Enslavers would put up flyers, place advertisements in newspapers, offer rewards, and send out posses to find them. Under the Fugitive Slave Act, enslavers could send federal marshals into free states to kidnap them. The law also brought bounty hunters into the business of returning enslaved people to their enslavers; a former enslaved person could be brought back into a slave state to be sold back into slavery if they were without freedom papers. In 1851, there was a case of a black coffeehouse waiter whom federal marshals kidnapped on behalf of John Debree, who claimed to be the man&#x27;s enslaver.

===Capture===
Enslavers often harshly punished those they successfully recaptured, such as by amputating limbs, whipping, branding, and hobbling.

Individuals who aided fugitive slaves were charged and punished under this law. In the case of &quot;Ableman v. Booth&quot;, the latter was charged with aiding Joshua Glover&#x27;s escape in Wisconsin by preventing his capture by federal marshals. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was unconstitutional, requiring states to violate their laws. &quot;Ableman v. Booth&quot; was appealed by the federal government to the US Supreme Court, which upheld the act&#x27;s constitutionality.

== Hiding out, living free ==
Fugitives were not necessarily &quot;on the run,&quot; they were simply not under the control of their legal owner or employer. The maroon communities of the Great Dismal Swamp, the Black Seminole communities of Florida, and the woodlands of South Carolina sheltered free-living fugitive slaves. Some fugitives even managed to live &quot;free&quot; in cities, at least for a time. For instance, one runaway was found living in the steeple of the Baton Rouge Methodist Church where his makeshift apartment included &quot;kitchen furniture, extra clothes, dried beef, a revolver, and a knife.&quot;

==The Underground Railroad==
The Underground Railroad was a network of black and white abolitionists between the late 18th century and the end of the American Civil War who helped fugitive slaves escape to freedom. Members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), African Methodist Episcopal Church, Baptists, Methodists, and other religious sects helped in operating the Underground Railroad.
In 1786, George Washington complained that a Quaker tried to free one of his slaves. In the early 1800s, Isaac T. Hopper, a Quaker from Philadelphia, and a group of people from North Carolina established a network of stations in their local area. In 1831, when Tice David was captured going into Ohio from Kentucky, his enslaver blamed an &quot;Underground Railroad&quot; who helped in the escape. Eight years later, while being tortured for his escape, a man named Jim said he was going north along the &quot;underground railroad to Boston.&quot;

Fellow enslaved people often helped those who had run away. They gave signals, such as the lighting of a particular number of lamps, or the singing of a particular song on Sunday, to let escaping people know if it was safe to be in the area or if there were slave hunters nearby. If the freedom seeker stayed in a slave cabin, they would likely get food and learn good hiding places in the woods as they made their way north.

Hiding places called &quot;stations&quot; were set up in private homes, churches, and schoolhouses in border states between slave and free states. John Brown had a secret room in his tannery to give escaped enslaved people places to stay on their way. People who maintained the stations provided food, clothing, shelter, and instructions about reaching the next &quot;station&quot;. Often, enslaved people had to make their way through southern slave states on their own to reach them.

The network extended throughout the United States—including Spanish Florida, Indian Territory, and Western United States—and into Canada and Mexico. The Underground Railroad was initially an escape route that would assist fugitive enslaved African Americans in arriving in the Northern states; however, with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, as well as other laws aiding the Southern states in the capture of runaway slaves, it became a mechanism to reach Canada. Canada was a haven for enslaved African-Аmericans because it had already abolished slavery by 1783. Black Canadians were also provided equal protection under the law. The well-known Underground Railroad &quot;conductor&quot; Harriet Tubman is said to have led approximately 300 enslaved people to Canada. In some cases, freedom seekers immigrated to Europe and the Caribbean islands.

===Harriet Tubman===

One of the most notable runaway slaves of American history and conductors of the Underground Railroad is Harriet Tubman. Born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland, around 1822, Tubman as a young adult, escaped from her enslaver&#x27;s plantation in 1849. Between 1850 and 1860, she returned to the South numerous times to lead parties of other enslaved people to freedom, guiding them through the lands she knew well. She aided hundreds of people, including her parents, in their escape from slavery. Tubman followed north–south flowing rivers and the north star to make her way north. She preferred to guide runaway slaves on Saturdays because newspapers were not published on Sundays, which gave her a one-day head-start before runaway advertisements would be published. She preferred the winters because the nights were longer when it was the safest to travel. Tubman wore disguises. She sang songs in different tempos, such as &quot;Go Down Moses&quot; and &quot;Bound For the Promised Land&quot;, to indicate whether it was safe for freedom seekers to come out of hiding. Many people called her the &quot;Moses of her people.&quot; During the American Civil War, Tubman also worked as a spy, cook, and a nurse.

<text>Tracey Elizabeth Bregman (born May 29, 1963) is an American actress. She is best known for the role of Lauren Fenmore on the CBS soap operas &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

==Early life==
Bregman was born May 29, 1963, in Munich, Germany, to American musical arranger, record producer and composer Buddy Bregman and Canadian-born actress Suzanne Lloyd. She lived in Great Britain until the age of 10 when her family relocated to California. She has been acting since she was 11 years old, and currently resides in Malibu, California. She studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.

==Career==
Bregman made her acting debut playing a small part in the 1978 made-for-television movie, &quot;Three on a Date&quot;. Later that year, she was cast in the NBC daytime soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; portraying troubled teen, Donna Temple Craig. In 1979, she received Young Artist Award for Best Juvenile Actress in A Daytime Series for her performance in soap. She left the soap in 1980. In 1981, she made her big screen debut starring in the slasher film &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot; by Columbia Pictures. She later starred alongside Jill St. John in the prison drama film &quot;The Concrete Jungle&quot; (1982) and in the Canadian comedy-drama film, &quot;The Funny Farm&quot; (1983). On television, she guest-starred on &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fame&quot;, and &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;.

In 1983, Bregman returned to daytime television with the role of Lauren Fenmore in the CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Bregman initially believed her role as Lauren would be brief, but after six months the soap offered her a contract and she accepted. When it was introduced in 1985, she was the first actress to be awarded the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series (then known as the &quot;Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series&quot;), being nominated for the same award again in 1987 and for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in both 2006 and 2008. In 1992, Bregman brought the character to &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, resulting in her migrating there fully in 1995. In 2000, Bregman returned to &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, remaining on a recurring status. From April to June 2010, while still portraying Lauren, Bregman took on double-duty with &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, as she also portrayed Sheila Carter&#x27;s sister, Sarah. In, 2010, she also appeared alongside her &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; co-star, Christian LeBlanc, in the music video for Reba McEntire&#x27;s single, &quot;I Keep On Loving You&quot;.

Bregman appeared in a number of made-for-television movies, including &quot;Sex &amp; Mrs. X&quot; (2000), &quot;Low Lifes&quot; (2012), and &quot;A Very Charming Christmas Town&quot; (2020). Bregman starred in the 2013 thriller film &quot;Misogynist&quot; alongside Jonathan Bennett and Eve Mauro, earning a nomination for Best Actress at the Los Angeles Underground Film Festival.

Bregman was a vegetarian from an early age and now follows a vegan lifestyle.

Bregman married Ron Recht in 1987; the couple had two sons, Austin (born 1991) and Landon (born 1996). They divorced after 23 years of marriage in 2010.

On April 7, 2014, Bregman was inducted into the Ride of Fame and has a New York City double decker bus dedicated to her and her accomplishments.

Bregman lost her Malibu home to a wildfire in November 2018.

<text>Arthur Dunkel (26 August 1932 – 8 June 2005) was a Swiss (Portuguese-born) administrator. He served as director-general of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade between 1980 and 1993. Dunkel was educated at the Graduate Institute of International Studies, in Geneva. He was Professor for International Trade at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland).

Arthur Dunkel took an active part in the Uruguay Round Negotiations of the GATT. His contribution to the successful completion of these negotiations was vital. When negotiations had passed the deadline and no agreement had emerged he took initiative in his own hands compiling the &#x27;Dunkel Draft&#x27; in December 1991. The draft put together the results of negotiations and provided an arbitrated solution to issues on which negotiators failed to agree. Even though the United States and India continued to bargain for changes to the Dunkel Draft, only minor amendments were made in the sphere of agriculture. The Dunkel Draft was accepted and became the foundation of the World Trade Organization.

<doc id="744939" wikidata="Q382049" url="?curid=744939" title="John Thomas Dunlop">
<text>John Thomas Dunlop (July 5, 1914October 2, 2003) was an American administrator, labor economist, and educator. Dunlop was the United States Secretary of Labor between 1975 and 1976 under President Gerald Ford. He was Director of the United States Cost of Living Council from 1973 to 1974, Chairman of the United States Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations from 1993 to 1995, which produced the Dunlop Report in 1994. He was also arbitrator and impartial chairman of various United States labor-management committees, and a member of numerous government boards on industrial relations disputes and economic stabilization.

Dunlop taught at Harvard University from 1938 until his retirement as Thomas W. Lamont University Professor in 1984. While there, he was chair of the Economics Department from 1961 to 1966 and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1969 to 1973.

Dunlop came to be recognized in the postwar United States as the most influential figure in the field of industrial relations. Though primarily a labor economist and later an academic dean at Harvard University, Dunlop carried out advisory roles in every U.S. Presidential Administration from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bill Clinton. He mediated and arbitrated disputes in a wide variety of industries and over a range of issues in the formative post-World War II period. He also influenced the study of industrial and labor relations with his framework of an &quot;industrial relations system&quot; that arose from his scholarly as well as applied work. In looking back at his own legacy, Dunlop regarded himself fundamentally as a problem solver with an abiding interest in the workplace.

Among the numerous books Dunlop wrote are &quot;Industrial Relations Systems&quot; (1958, 1993); &quot;Industrialism and Industrial Man&quot; (1960, joint author); &quot;Labor and the American Community&quot; (1970, with Derek C. Bok); &quot;Dispute Resolution, Negotiation and Consensus Building&quot; (1984); and &quot;The Management of Labor Unions&quot; (1990).

==Career==
===Early life and education===
Dunlop was born in Placerville in northern California, where his family owned a pear orchard. Devoted Presbyterian missionaries, his parents moved to the Philippines when Dunlop was four years old, the eldest of a family that grew to seven children. He was raised and educated on the island of Cebu, and remained there until graduating from high school. Then, Dunlop returned to the United States with his older brother to enroll in college. Dunlop was initially rejected from the University of California, Berkeley because of his unusual background and instead enrolled at Marin Junior College in 1931.

Dunlop later transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1935. He remained there for his doctorate in Economics, where he produced the dissertation &quot;Movements of Wage-Rates in the Business Cycle&quot; (1939). While studying at Berkeley, Dunlop met with his wife, Dorothy Emily Webb; they married on July 6, 1937. That year, Dunlop attended the University of Cambridge on a fellowship, where he studied under John Maynard Keynes. At the time, Dunlop lived near John Kenneth Galbraith, who later became a colleague at Harvard.

Although Dunlop&#x27;s intention was to study with Keynes during the fellowship, the elder&#x27;s poor health limited their interaction. Nonetheless, Dunlop&#x27;s study of wage setting in the cotton mill industry based on fieldwork conducted during that visit led him to publish a major paper in &quot;The Economic Journal&quot; in 1938 demonstrating a problem in Keynes&#x27; depiction of wage rigidity in the seminal work &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money&quot; (1936). In a laudatory note published with Dunlop&#x27;s paper, Keynes acknowledged the correction and the contribution of the paper.

===Professorial career===
Dunlop was shortly after offered a teaching fellowship at Harvard University&#x27;s economics department that he maintained throughout the rest of his life. He was tenured in 1945 and became a full professor at Harvard in 1950. He later chaired the Department of Economics between 1961 and 1966, and was Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences between 1970 and 1973. Dunlop was named Lamont University Professor in 1971.

Dunlop focused on wage determination and the role of markets and institutions in their determination. He wrote a series of articles in economic journals regarding the role of unions in wage setting, arguing that unions focused on balancing wage gains in collective bargaining against their employment effects. He also explored the impact of product market forces on the level of wages, arguing that neoclassical models of wage determination underplayed the important (and sometimes idiosyncratic) role of product markets. In 1958, he brought together his scholarly work on wage determination with applied experience in dispute resolution in his seminal book &quot;Industrial Relations Systems&quot;. The book proposed a model of how an &quot;industrial relations system&quot; brings together product market, regulatory, and technological factors with the institutional practices of labor and business to produce wages, benefits, and other workplace outcomes. Several decades of scholarly debate followed its publication. He subsequently collaborated with Clark Kerr, Frederick Harbison, and Charles Myers on cross-national studies of the evolution of industrial relations systems, resulting in the book &quot;Industrialism and Industrial Man&quot; in 1960.

Dunlop trained several generations of doctoral students in the course of his career at Harvard. In the 1930s-50s, students included academics who became prominent industrial relations specialists, labor historians, and labor economists, including Irving Bernstein, David Brody, Morris Horowitz, Mark Leiserson, William Miernyk, Herbert Northrup, Jean Pearlson, Martin Segal, Jack Stieber, Lloyd Ulman, and Donald White. His students in the 1960s—80s went on to distinguished careers in labor and health economics, including Katharine Abraham, Kim Clark, Peter Doeringer, Richard B. Freeman, Jack Hirshleifer, Carol Jones, Garth Mangum, Daniel Quinn Mills, Joseph Newhouse, Michael Piore, James Scoville, Paula Voos, Michael Wachter, and David Weil. He collaborated with many other academics in a variety of fields including Frederick Abernathy, Derek Bok, Ray Goldberg, James Healy, Larry Katz, Clark Kerr, George Shultz, and Arnold Zack.

Along with his scholarly activities at Harvard, he was deeply involved in the creation of many programs and innovations at the university. In 1942, Dunlop, along with Professors Sumner Slichter and James Healy, co-founded the Harvard Trade Union Program, only the second executive program at Harvard (the first being the Neiman Fellows program in journalism) that continues to provide training to senior leaders in the labor movement in the US and around the world. He taught in this program from its founding until his death in 2003. An unnamed colleague told reporter Daniel Q. Haney of the Associated Press that Dunlop is &quot;more at home with a plumbers&#x27; convention than with the Harvard faculty. He even sort of looks like a plumber, the way he always wears bow ties.&quot; He also helped to found in 1959 the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. He played significant roles in the early days of the Harvard Kennedy School, and served as the acting director of its Center for Business and Government from 1987 to 1991.

Dunlop also played an active role in solving problems at the university. During a critical period in its history following the police bust in 1969 and subsequent shutdown of the university, Dunlop played a crucial role in restoring stability to the institution, leading a student faculty committee through a process to resolve the conflict and ultimately to introduce governance reforms. Following Nathan Pusey&#x27;s resignation as president, he then served as Dean and as a close advisor to President Derek Bok during the tumultuous period of the Vietnam War, settling disputes between students, faculty, and the Harvard administration. Bok commented &quot;He probably saved this university at a very critical time after the student riots in 1968-69&quot; with &quot;leadership and a cool head.&quot;

Many years later, following a highly contentious series of organizing efforts, a new union was elected at Harvard to represent clerical and technical workers. In light of the acrimony that accompanied Harvard&#x27;s campaign against unionization, Harvard President Derek Bok tapped Dunlop to lead the university&#x27;s management negotiation team. Dunlop negotiated with the lead organizer of the newly formed Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Union, Kris Rondeau, what is widely regarded as an innovative collective bargaining agreement that focuses on problem solving and staff engagement. The agreement remains in effect today, the ninth contract currently being negotiated in 2012.

Dunlop was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He remained on the Harvard faculty his entire life, taking emeritus status in 1985. Even after retirement, he remained active in research and teaching including leading newly established freshmen seminars at the age of 85.

===Impact in Washington===
Dunlop began his work in Washington during World War II. On January 12, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9017 instating the National War Labor Board (NWLB). Charged with settling labor / management disputes in exchange for a no-strike agreement, the NWLB arbitrated disputes across major industries. Because of its centrality in setting wages and benefits in a climate of military mobilization, limited resources, inflationary pressure, the NWLB&#x27;s staff and leadership received a rapid-fire introduction to the problems and challenges confronting hundreds of enterprises.

From 1943 to 1945, Dunlop held the post of Chief of the Research and Statistics Branch of the NWLB and the experience helped him develop his fact-finding approach to resolving disputes. Several other NWLB alumni became major figures in the field of Industrial Relations including Clark Kerr, the future Chancellor and President of the University of California, and Benjamin Aaron, director of the UCLA Institute of Industrial Relations from 1960 to 1975. Derek Bok, former President of Harvard University, commented in 2003 that Dunlop &quot;... was the last surviving member of a small group of people who came of age during World War II who had the respect of both business and labor.&quot;

In the war&#x27;s aftermath, President Harry Truman selected Dunlop for the Atomic Energy Labor Panel. Between 1948 and 1957, he chaired the National Joint Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes in the Building and Construction Industry. He served on the Wage Stabilization Board from 1950 to 1952, experience that would decades later encourage the Nixon Administration to put him in charge of efforts to oversee setting wages and price controls. In 1973, Dunlop replaced Donald H. Rumsfeld as director of the Cost of Living Council.

==Political life==
In March 1975, President Gerald Ford selected Dunlop as his first Secretary of Labor. Dunlop focused on a variety of efforts that sought to bring the idea of multi-party problem solving to the regulatory process, and in implementing labor policies. His views on the importance of government policy in fashioning agreements among parties rather than through direct regulatory authority were laid out in his article &quot;The Limits of Legal Compulsion&quot;. In that article, Dunlop notes:

The desire to bring parties together to solve problems led Dunlop to resign as Secretary of Labor. The construction industry remained an ongoing focus of Dunlop due to its important role in the US economy and particularly the potential of collective bargaining agreements in that industry to have inflationary pressures in the larger economies. Building trades unions sought changes in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to reflect the distinctive problems of that sector in regard to rules regarding union recognition, organizing and the rights to picket. Through ongoing negotiations between trade union leaders and leading contractors and construction end users, Dunlop crafted an agreement between the parties that would amend the NLRA in ways sought by unions in exchange for their agreement along with management to longer term industry reforms, in a bill that would move in tandem through Congress. After brokering the deal and receiving support from Ford, the Common Situs legislation was passed by Congress. However, facing stiff opposition from a surging Ronald Reagan in the Republican primaries of 1976 and a more assertive Republican right wing, Ford reneged on Dunlop&#x27;s pledge and vetoed the legislation. In January 1976, Dunlop resigned as Secretary of Labor.

Dunlop served subsequent administrations. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed Dunlop the chair of the Pay Advisory Committee. Between 1981 and 1984, Dunlop belonged to President Reagan&#x27;s National Productivity Advisory Committee, while from 1989 to 1991 he served on President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s Social Security Advisory Council.

In 1993, the Clinton Administration named Dunlop the Chair of the Commission on the Future of Worker Management Relations (soon known as the Dunlop Commission). The commission was established to examine the need for reform of the National Labor Relations Act and related federal laws regarding workplace representation and recommend changes to them. Differences among Commission members and the midterm election of 1994 that brought a Republican majority to the House of Representatives thwarted action on many of the Dunlop Commission&#x27;s recommendations. Dunlop nonetheless went on to work on promoting negotiated rulemaking for workplace health and safety and crafted an agreement between the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Association of Home Builders and the Building Trades Council (AFL-CIO) regarding health and safety standards for residential construction.

===Dispute resolution in multiple fields===

Along with his service in government, Dunlop practiced dispute resolution in a variety of other areas, pioneering innovative multi-party agreements in a variety of areas. In agriculture, he intervened in an eight-year-old dispute between the Campbell Soup Company, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC, an AFL-CIO affiliate that organized farm workers in the Midwest) and tomato growers in Michigan and Ohio regarding conditions of work among the migrant workers who worked for growers supplying Campbell&#x27;s with tomatoes. Since agricultural workers are exempted from the NLRA, private sector employers are not obligated to recognize unions. In addition, the farm workers were treated as independent contractors to the individual growers supplying Campbell Soup. Growers contended that the prices received for their tomatoes precluded increases in wages or provision of better housing conditions in labor camps.

In 1986, Campbell Soup approached Dunlop to assist them in settling the dispute. Dunlop brought together the parties and fashioned an agreement ending the corporate campaign in exchange for union representation among tomato growers, including a mechanism for union recognition and dispute resolution through a Commission chaired by Dunlop and an equal number of representatives of labor and growers. The agreement also provided growers higher prices in exchange for agreement to bargaining with the union. As a result, the agreement created a private system of union recognition, collective bargaining and dispute resolution accepted by the parties. The agreement soon expanded to include pickle growers and the food processors Vlasic and Dean Foods and has been renewed consistently to the present. In 2003, an agreement between FLOC and the North Carolina Growers Association extending the Dunlop Agricultural Commission model was signed providing the only collective bargaining agreement covering guest workers from Mexico.

In 1979, Dunlop and Harvard University colleague Frederick H. Abernathy (Gordon McKay Research Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Abbott and James Lawrence Research Professor of Engineering), a professor of fluid mechanics, were commissioned by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union to undertake a summer study of the competitiveness of the men&#x27;s suit industry. The study focused on the need to encourage research and development on the creation (and later the adoption) of technology in the textile and clothing sector. Eventually Dunlop&#x27;s and Abernathy&#x27;s efforts led to the creation of the Tailored Clothing and Technology Corporation [TC]2, a government-business-labor organization, funded cooperatively the three parties. [TC]2 initially funded development of new technologies for the industry. It later turned to a broader focus on encouraging the use of existing technology among clothing manufacturers and textile producers.[TC]2 is discussed in the Commentary of Dunlop, Industrial Relations Systems, Revised Edition (Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 1993), pp. 36–37. In 1989, [TC]2 changed its name to the Textile and Clothing Technology Corporation to reflect its expanded mission. The group, now based in Raleigh, North Carolina, remains active in this area.

A final area of innovative dispute resolution arose in Dunlop&#x27;s home state of Massachusetts. Following a growing number of disputes and walkouts among police and firefighters in the 1970s, Dunlop mediated an agreement between police and firefighter local unions, an association of municipal governments, and state legislators on legislation to create a tri-partite (labor, public management, with an impartial third party chair, nominated by the two sides and appointed by the Governor) dispute resolution body to handle collective bargaining problems in the sector. The legislation was passed in 1977 creating the Joint Labor Management Committee (JLMC). The vast majority of the more than 1500 disputes handled by the JLMC in its history were done through mediation rather than the final step which imposed a settlement on the municipal executive where the dispute occurred (but not on the legislative body, such as city council or town meeting that appropriates funds).

==Legacy==

Dunlop produced a considerable body of articles, books, reports, and scholarship, with his work Industrial Relations Systems (1958) regarded as his biggest achievement. Thomas Kochan, the George Maverick Bunker Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, commented that this &quot;seminal book ... set the framework for scholarly analysis of our field for decades and became the focal point for debates over how relationships among labor, management, and government were structured and evolved over time.&quot;

The historian Ronald Schatz of Wesleyan University reflects on Dunlop and his generation of Industrial Relations (IR) specialists:

Throughout his career in academics and the applied world, Dunlop attempted to apply lessons learned in his early experience in settling disputes at the NWLB to other venues. Drawing on his training in economics and his own industrial relations system framework and his insistence on having the parties agree on a common set of facts, he helped establish both a theoretical and a practical method of resolving problems and creating institutions for their ongoing evolution. In his introduction to a reissuing of his book &quot;Industrial Relations Systems&quot; in 1993, Dunlop wrote:

He continued that work until late in his life. Dunlop died in 2003 in Boston.

There are two lecture series delivered at Harvard University in honor of John T. Dunlop, including 1) The John T. Dunlop Memorial Forum sponsored by the Harvard Trade Union Program where he taught for sixty years and 2) The John T. Dunlop Lecture hosted annually by the Joint Center of Housing Studies of Harvard University and supported with funds from the National Housing Endowment.

In addition, Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School of Design has an endowed professorship in Dunlop&#x27;s name (John T. Dunlop Professor in Housing and Urbanization), which was first given to Rahul Mehrotra in 2020.

<text>The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, better known as A&amp;P, was an American chain of grocery stores that operated from 1859 to 2015. From 1915 through 1975, A&amp;P was the largest grocery retailer in the United States (and, until 1965, the largest U.S. retailer of any kind).

A&amp;P was considered an American icon that, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;was as well known as McDonald&#x27;s or Google is today&quot;. At its peak in the 1940s, A&amp;P captured 10% of total US grocery spending. Known for innovation, A&amp;P improved consumers&#x27; nutritional habits by making available a vast assortment of food products at much lower costs. Until 1982, A&amp;P also was a large food manufacturer.

A&amp;P was founded in 1859 as &quot;Gilman &amp; Company&quot; by George Gilman, who opened a small chain of retail tea and coffee stores in New York City, and then expanded to a national mail order business. The firm grew to 70 stores by 1878; by 1900, it operated almost 200 stores. A&amp;P grew dramatically by introducing the economy store concept in 1912, growing to 1,600 stores by 1915. After World War I, it added stores that offered meat and produce, while expanding manufacturing.

In 1930, A&amp;P, by then the world&#x27;s largest retailer, reached $2.9 billion in sales ($ billion today) with 15,000 stores. In 1936, it adopted the self-serve supermarket concept and opened 4,000 larger stores (while phasing out many of its smaller units) by 1950. After two bankruptcies, A&amp;P finally closed the last of its doors in 2015.

==History==
===1859–1878: Gilman era===

The forerunner of A&amp;P was founded in the 1850s as Gilman &amp; Company by George Gilman (1826–1901) to continue his father&#x27;s leather tanning business; in 1858 the firm&#x27;s address was 98 Gold Street in Manhattan. Gilman&#x27;s father died in 1859, leaving the son wealthy. That year, Gilman &amp; Company entered the tea and coffee business from that storefront. One source speculates that Gilman decided to enter a more respectable business in light of his wealth. In May 1861, Gilman turned over the tanning business to his brother Winthrop; George moved his tea business to 129 Front Street. Initially, Gilman &amp; Company was a wholesaler. In early 1863 the firm became a retailer, Great American Tea Company. Quickly, it opened five stores, moving its office and warehouse to 51 Vesey Street.

Gilman proved to be a master at promotion; the business quickly expanded by advertising low prices. The firm was able to offer low prices by acting as both the wholesaler and retailer. Gilman also built a nationwide mail order business. By 1866, the firm was valued at more than $1 million (~$ in ). In 1869, the transcontinental railroad was completed; Gilman created a parallel company, the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, to promote the then-new concept of prepackaged tea under the &quot;Thea-Nector&quot; name. The tea company, which some sources say was co-founded by George Huntington Hartford, continued to use the &quot;Great American&quot; name for mail-order purposes. In 1871, A&amp;P introduced another concept when it offered premiums, such as lithographs, china, and glassware with the purchase of coffee and/or tea at its stores. These premiums are now collectibles.

===1878–1951: Hartford era===
====Evolution of the grocery store====
Hartford joined Gilman &amp; Company as a clerk perhaps in the late 1850s; Hartford later was promoted to bookkeeper, then cashier, in 1866. By 1871 Hartford was in a position of authority and was responsible for expanding A&amp;P to Chicago after its great fire. A&amp;P&#x27;s first store outside New York City was opened just days after the disaster. The firm rapidly expanded; in 1875 A&amp;P had stores in 16 cities. In 1878, Gilman left the active management of the firm to Hartford. By then, the firm operated 70 lavishly-equipped stores and a mail order business with combined annual sales of $1 million.

To raise revenue, Congress raised tariffs on tea and coffee. Profits on these products declined; around 1880 A&amp;P started to sell sugar in its stores. The company continued aggressive growth and by 1884 operated stores as far west as Kansas City and as far south as Atlanta. The company also operated wagon routes to serve rural customers. About this time, two of Hartford&#x27;s sons, George (1864–1957) and John (1872–1951), joined the firm. A&amp;P lore holds that George convinced his father to expand the product line to include A&amp;P-branded baking powder. Over the next decade, the company added other A&amp;P-branded products, such as condensed milk, spices, and butter. As it expanded its offerings, the tea company was gradually creating the first grocery chain. By 1900, the firm had sales of $5 million (~$ in ) from 198 stores as well as its mail order and wagon route operations. However, other grocery chains were expanding more rapidly and blanketing their respective areas while the tea company&#x27;s stores were spread over a much larger area. A&amp;P quickly found itself at a disadvantage.

In 1901, George Gilman died without a will, starting a legal battle among his numerous heirs. The senior Hartford stepped into the battle by asserting that, in 1878, Gilman gave him half of the company in an unwritten partnership agreement. Evidence provided to the court established that Hartford received half of A&amp;P&#x27;s profits starting in 1878 and that the company&#x27;s leases were in his name. The heirs realized that without Hartford, the firm would quickly become unprofitable. Therefore, in 1902 they agreed to a settlement where A&amp;P was to be incorporated, with $2.1 million (~$ in ) in assets.

Under this agreement, the Gilman heirs received $1.25 million in preferred shares at 6% interest, while Hartford received $700,000 in common stock and the remainder of the preferred shares. This gave Hartford control of the voting stock. Over several years, Hartford was able to repurchase the preferred shares from the Gilman heirs. A&amp;P opened an average of one store every three weeks. A nine-story headquarters and warehouse was built in Jersey City; it later expanded to include a manufacturing plant and bakery.

By 1908, George Hartford Sr. divided management responsibilities among his sons, with George Jr. controlling finance with John directing sales and operations. The sons ran A&amp;P for over 40 years. The younger Hartford moved aggressively to promote the &quot;A&amp;P&quot; brand, dramatically increasing the product line. To make space for the new items, A&amp;P replaced in-store premiums with Plaid Stamps, which sought to mimic S&amp;H Green Stamps, a popular rewards program. By 1912, the corporation operated 400 stores and averaged a 22% gross margin, resulting in a 2% profit. A&amp;P&#x27;s peddlers were also operating 5,000 rural routes in distinctive red-and-black wagons.

====Development of economy stores====
Food prices were a political issue in the 1912 presidential election after a 35% increase in 10 years. To counter this trend, some chains experimented with a no-frills format. After long debate, the Hartfords agreed to John&#x27;s proposal of experimenting with an economy store designed to operate at a 12% gross margin. Capitalized at only $3,000 including its initial inventory, the prototype economy store operated with only a manager, and without fancy fixtures. Within two months, weekly sales increased to $800 and the store achieved a 30% annual return on investment. A&amp;P quickly expanded the concept; by 1915 the chain operated 1,600 stores.

A&amp;P&#x27;s tremendous growth created problems with suppliers. Cream of Wheat, the largest breakfast food manufacturer, demanded that all retailers adhere to the cereal&#x27;s pricing per box. A&amp;P purchased the product at wholesale, 11 cents per box (3 cents less), and decided that a 1-cent markup was appropriate for its economy store format. Cream of Wheat cut off supplies and A&amp;P sued. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Hough ruled against A&amp;P, saying that a manufacturer can establish retail prices. As a result, A&amp;P and other large chains expanded manufacturing of private brands.

Hartford Sr. died in 1917; control of the company passed into a trust with his sons George, Edward, and John as trustees in complete control.

====Adding stores that included grocery, meat, produce, and dairy====
After World War I, A&amp;P rapidly expanded; in 1925 it operated 13,961 stores. The newer combination stores included space for meats, produce, and dairy, as well as traditional grocery items. Sales reached $400 million and profit was $10 million. However, the Hartford brothers were concerned that gross margins had reached 22% to cover higher costs and that the chain veered from its low-cost discipline. In early 1926, the brothers discussed the situation with division management and launched a program to lower prices and improve cost controls. That year, sales increased 32%; A&amp;P moved its headquarters to the new Graybar Building adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.

In 1927, A&amp;P established a Canadian division; by 1929 it operated 200 stores in Ontario and Quebec. In 1930, the corporation&#x27;s 16,000 stores reached $2.9 billion (~$ in ) in sales, resulting in a 25% grocery-store share in its operating areas, and about 10% nationwide. No retail company had ever achieved these results. A&amp;P was twice as large as the next largest retailer, Sears, and four times that of grocer Kroger. Unlike most of its competitors, A&amp;P was in excellent position to weather the Great Depression. The Hartfords built their chain without borrowing; their low-price format resulted in even higher sales. From 1929 through 1932, A&amp;P reported a record $110 million in after-tax profits with each Hartford child earning over $5 million yearly in dividends and equity.

A&amp;P&#x27;s success caused a backlash that threatened to destroy it. Thousands of mom-and-pop grocery stores could not match A&amp;P&#x27;s prices. While small operators had little political clout, they were supplied by thousands of wholesale distributors which had considerable political influence. Anti-chain store movements gained traction in the 1920s, but became stronger during the Depression. In 1935, Texas Congressman Wright Patman introduced legislation that would have levied a federal tax on chain stores. If adopted, this legislation likely would have ended A&amp;P.

While this legislation did not move in Congress, in 1936 Patman sponsored the Robinson–Patman Act that outlawed charging different prices to similar customers; this law passed. Patman then reintroduced his first bill. A&amp;P retained a lobbyist and dropped its opposition to unionizing activities of the politically powerful American Federation of Labor. George and John Hartford also took the unusual step of publishing an open letter pointing out that the legislation would increase food prices. The tide of public opinion then turned against the bill, which was defeated.

====Converting to supermarkets====
In 1930, the first supermarket opened in California. On the East Coast, Michael J. Cullen, a then-former A&amp;P employee, opened his first King Kullen supermarket in Jamaica, Queens. Two years later, Big Bear opened in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and quickly equaled the sales of 100 A&amp;Ps. In 1933, A&amp;P&#x27;s sales dropped 19%, to $820 million, because of the competition. After considerable debate, the Hartford brothers decided to open 100 supermarkets, the first of which was in Braddock, Pennsylvania. The new stores proved to be very successful; in 1938, the company operated 1,100 supermarkets. The chain continued to build supermarkets and slowly phase out smaller stores except in dense urban areas; in 1950, A&amp;P operated 4,000 supermarkets and 500 smaller stores. Sales reached $3.2 billion with an after-tax profit of $32 million.

A&amp;P&#x27;s success attracted the attention of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s anti-trust chief, Thurman Arnold, who was urged by Representative Wright Patman to investigate A&amp;P. In 1942, A&amp;P and their senior executives—including the Hartford brothers—were criminally charged for restraint of trade in Dallas federal court. In 1944, prosecutors withdrew the complaint on grounds that the Dallas federal judge thought the case was weak.

The same day the Dallas case was withdrawn, charges were filed in Danville, Illinois against the same defendants, and were assigned to Federal Judge Walter Lindley. The prosecution complained that A&amp;P had an unfair competitive advantage because their vertical integration including manufacturing; warehousing, and retailing allowed them to charge lower prices. Prosecutors also complained that A&amp;P refused to buy from food retailers who sold only through brokers or refused to give A&amp;P advertising allowances. The judges contended that if unchecked, A&amp;P would become a monopoly. A&amp;P said their grocery-store share was only about 15%, much less than the leaders in other industries. Judge Lindley agreed with the government, fining each defendant $10,000.

In 1949, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Lindley&#x27;s decision; A&amp;P decided not to appeal further. In September, the anti-trust division asked the court to order the spinoff of A&amp;P&#x27;s manufacturing operations and the breakup of A&amp;P&#x27;s retail operations into seven independent companies. Thousands of letters poured into the Justice Department supporting A&amp;P; the Hartford brothers gave extensive interviews with &quot;Time&quot; magazine and appeared on the November 13, 1950, cover. &quot;Time&quot; wrote that, next to General Motors, A&amp;P sold more goods than any other retailer in the world. John was quoted as saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know any grocer who wants to stay small ... I don&#x27;t see how any businessman can limit his growth and stay healthy.&quot; The case dragged on into the business-friendly Eisenhower administration. In late 1953, the government agreed to drop its demands to break up A&amp;P if they shut down their produce brokerage that also supplied competitors.

In fighting the anti-trust suits, A&amp;P also emphasized the considerable impact of their activities on the public welfare, which had been recognized as the legacy of George Hartford Sr. and his sons. The concepts pioneered and perfected by the Hartfords and their competitors enabled the public to enjoy healthier eating at lower cost. In 1950, the average American consumed 10 percent more food than in 1930, with poorer households enjoying an especially important improvement in the quality of the food they consumed. John Kenneth Galbraith supported this contention in his 1952 book, &quot;American Capitalism&quot;, by citing A&amp;P as an example of countervailing power. To support his thesis, he discussed a 1937 A&amp;P study of the feasibility of opening a plant to manufacture corn flakes. The mere possibility of A&amp;P producing corn flakes forced existing corn flake manufacturers to lower their prices by 10%.

===1951–1974: Post-Hartford era===
In 1951, John Hartford died in the Chrysler Building after returning from a meeting of the automaker&#x27;s board of directors. George remained as A&amp;P&#x27;s chairman and treasurer, appointing the corporation&#x27;s longtime secretary Ralph Burger as its new president. While Burger started with A&amp;P in 1910 as a clerk in Glens Falls, New York, he was a staffer who lacked John Hartford&#x27;s strategic marketing skills. Under Burger, A&amp;P continued to report record sales and operated with expenses of 12.6% of sales when the industry average was 15%.

Burger was also president of the John A. Hartford Foundation started by sons John and George in 1929, assuring Burger&#x27;s control of A&amp;P when George died in 1957. George&#x27;s trust was dissolved; the stock began selling on the New York Stock Exchange (under the symbol GAP) at $59 per share. For the first time, A&amp;P elected six outside directors onto its board. In late 1961, A&amp;P stock peaked at $70 (~$ in ).

The seeds for A&amp;P&#x27;s 35-year fall from the country&#x27;s largest grocery to bankruptcy (and later liquidation) were planted in the 1950s:
*A&amp;P was starved of capital. While A&amp;P was publicly traded, control rested with Burger, who headed both the corporation and the Hartford Foundation. Most of A&amp;P&#x27;s profit was declared as dividends to satisfy the income needs of the trust and its heirs. A&amp;P also remained opposed to debt financing; the only source of capital was the depreciation account. While competitors invested in larger, modern supermarkets, A&amp;P was slow to update its retail capital plant. By 1970, A&amp;P stores were considerably smaller and mostly older than those of its competitors.
*A&amp;P placed too much emphasis on private label products. In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that manufacturers could not establish minimum prices unless the retailer agreed to the arrangement. This decision launched a revolution in discount retailing fueled by the rapid increase in television advertising that raised demand for national brands. Contrary to this, A&amp;P invested substantial amounts of its scarce capital to expand manufacturing, including $25 million to construct the world&#x27;s largest food plant in Horseheads, New York. Because A&amp;P stores were smaller, its shelves were dominated by private-label products, and customers found that national brands were often out of stock.
*A&amp;P&#x27;s labor costs were higher than those of most competitors. Because A&amp;P stopped growing, a rising percentage of its workers were making higher wages due to their seniority. This was not a problem for most of A&amp;P&#x27;s competitors because they were rapidly expanding and had relatively fewer workers with high seniority. To offset higher labor costs, A&amp;P tried to operate stores with fewer employees, resulting in long lines at checkouts and empty shelves.

Ralph Burger attempted to reverse downward tonnage figures by reintroducing trading stamps, creating A&amp;P&#x27;s Plaid Stamps. However, by late 1962, the initial sales gains evaporated and the six outside directors threatened to resign unless Burger retired. When Burger left in May 1963, the stock was trading in the $30s (~$ in ). Burger was replaced with a succession of presidents who were unable to stem the downward spiral. In 1971, the board turned to William J. Kane, who joined A&amp;P in 1934 as a full-time store clerk. Kane believed that A&amp;P could be turned around by focusing on basic store operations, including cleanliness, product availability, customer service, and courtesy.

When his program stalled, Kane implemented a strategy to substantially cut prices by converting A&amp;P to a warehouse store concept that became known as W.E.O. Warehouse Economy Outlet (or Where Economy Originates). The problem was that most A&amp;Ps were not large enough to properly implement the program; losses quickly mounted. In early 1973, the stock dropped to $17, and Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf+Western made a tender offer at $20 per share. Kane rejected the offer, although some stockholders thought that the offer was attractive considering A&amp;P&#x27;s continuing difficulties. A&amp;P exited California and Washington state in 1971 and 1974, respectively, making Missouri its westernmost reach. In 1974, the corporation also left its long-time headquarters in the Graybar Building, moving to Montvale, New Jersey.

===1975–2001: Scott/Wood era===

In February 1975, A&amp;P considered a plan by Booz Allen Hamilton to close 36% of its 3,468 stores. Kane agreed to resign and was replaced by Jonathan Scott, the 44-year-old president of Albertsons. Under Scott, A&amp;P closed 1,500 stores in three years, reducing to 1,978 units. Scott hired numerous executives from outside and pushed authority down to the regional level. During his first three years, A&amp;P built 300 supermarkets ranging from to , along with its first combination grocery-drug stores with under the A&amp;P Family Mart name. The first Family Mart opened in Greenville, South Carolina, as The Family Mart in 1977.

The Family Mart chain consisted of mostly stores, and were among the first A&amp;P stores to possess a combination of a full-service supermarket and pharmacy. Scott continued Kane&#x27;s efforts to improve basic store operations (including cleanliness and customer service) instituting a large training program. Weekly per-store sales increased from $37,000 in 1974 to over $70,000 in 1976, with total sales increasing from $6.4 billion to $7.2 billion despite the closures. Manufacturing was also reorganized. While initial results were promising, by 1978, A&amp;P profits started to slide due to economic conditions caused by high inflation.
With the share price down to $7, the John A. Hartford Foundation finally came to the conclusion that it could no longer wait for a turnaround. Erivan Haub, owner of the German Tengelmann Group, expressed interest. Born in 1930, Haub studied retailing in the U.S. after World War II and built his family&#x27;s grocery business into a 2,000-store chain with annual sales of the equivalent of $2 billion. Although still having a home in Germany, his children were born in the United States.

Haub agreed to pay $7.375 per share for 42% of A&amp;P&#x27;s stock. Haub also quietly bought other shares until he owned 50.3% in February 1981. Scott did not renew his five-year contract; Haub hired James Wood to become chairman. Wood, an Englishman who was the same age as Haub, previously ran the American Grand Union supermarket chain. Many executives recruited by Scott left A&amp;P; they were replaced by Wood&#x27;s associates from Grand Union.

In Germany, Tengelmann had considerable success with Plus stores; they were smaller units featuring low price private-label products along with a limited assortment of meats and produce. A&amp;P opened several divisions of Plus stores in the U.S. to take advantage of A&amp;P&#x27;s manufacturing plants and numerous small stores. However, the concept failed to win American customers who were attracted to other chains offering low prices on national brands.

James Wood realized that another massive store-closing program was necessary to turn around A&amp;P. In October 1981, it announced that it would downsize to under 1,000 stores and close the Chicago division. Under the plan, A&amp;P also closed its large manufacturing group except the four coffee warehouses. To finance this program, A&amp;P planned to terminate its non-union pension plan, using its $200 million surplus. The plan&#x27;s obligations were covered by annuities that cost only about $130 million because of the then high interest rates. A&amp;P&#x27;s non-union employees were covered by a defined contribution 401(k).

William Walsh, then a recently retired executive, filed a class action that was ultimately settled by increasing the value of the annuities. A&amp;P still realized over $200 million and was not required to pay taxes because of tax losses carried forward from previous closing programs. The Philadelphia division also was to close, unless the unions agreed to contract concessions. When the unions refused, A&amp;P started implementing the plan. The unions offered to purchase the stores, but realized that they did not have the capital required. As an alternative, the unions agreed to a profit-sharing arrangement if A&amp;P formed a new subsidiary, and operated under a different name. The new banner, &quot;Super Fresh&quot;, proved profitable. A&amp;P realized that its name was not the asset it had been.

 A&amp;P started to acquire stores from other chains. Starting in 1982, A&amp;P acquired several chains that continued to be operated under their own names, rather than being converted to &quot;A&amp;P&quot;. While A&amp;P regained profitability in the 1980s, in 2002 it operated at a record loss because of new competition, especially from Walmart. A&amp;P closed more stores, which included the sale of its large Canadian division. A&amp;P also spun off Eight O&#x27;Clock Coffee, the last of its manufacturing units. In 1982, Stop &amp; Shop exited New Jersey, not returning for almost 20 years. A&amp;P purchased most of these stores to replace obsolete ones. In 1983, A&amp;P bought Wisconsin-based Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores (which had been part of the Kohl&#x27;s department store chain) from BATUS, enabling A&amp;P to reenter Wisconsin and Illinois. In 1984, A&amp;P purchased Pantry Pride&#x27;s Richmond, Virginia, division. The next year, A&amp;P reinforced its profitable Canadian division by closing stores in Quebec, and acquiring Ontario&#x27;s Dominion Stores. In the U.S., A&amp;P started construction of larger supermarkets known as &quot;A&amp;P Future Stores&quot;.

In 1986, A&amp;P purchased Waldbaum&#x27;s (with stores in southern New York and southern New England) and The Food Emporium, the latter an upscale New York City-based chain. In 1989, A&amp;P acquired Michigan-based Farmer Jack; also, A&amp;P attempted to expand into Europe by bidding unsuccessfully for the Gateway Corporation (then the United Kingdom&#x27;s third-largest grocery chain), although they did open stores in the Netherlands, which they operated until the early 2000s. At the end of the decade, A&amp;P reported a profit of 1.3% (compared to an industry average of 1.04%) on sales of $11 billion.

In the early 1990s, A&amp;P started to struggle again because of the economy and new competition, especially Walmart. In 1992, A&amp;P&#x27;s sales dropped to $1.1 billion; it posted a loss of $189 million. A&amp;P responded by strengthening its private label program and overhauling its remaining U.S. units. Most stores smaller than were expanded, closed, or replaced with units from to . The new stores included pharmacies, larger bakeries, and more general merchandise.

A&amp;P continued to suffer in the South and abandoned most of the region by pulling out of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia. Most of these stores were sold to Kroger. As a result, A&amp;P was reduced to four regions: the Northeast, the Midwest (Michigan and Wisconsin), New Orleans, and Ontario. To reinforce the New Orleans division, A&amp;P purchased six Schwegmann supermarkets; however, A&amp;P was now reduced to 600 stores. Christian W.E. Haub, the youngest son of Erivan, became co-CEO in 1994 and CEO in 1997 when Wood retired from that post. In 2001, Wood also retired as chairman, with Haub assuming that title as well.

===2001–2015: Final years as a supermarket chain===

Nationwide, Walmart gained a dominant position in the grocery industry, forcing much of the competition to downsize, though in A&amp;P&#x27;s core Northeast region, Walmart still had not become a major grocery competitor. In 2003, after declaring its largest loss, A&amp;P closed Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores and A&amp;P&#x27;s remaining stores in Vermont and New Hampshire, reducing it to just over 500 stores. Also in 2003, A&amp;P spun off the Eight O&#x27;Clock Coffee division (its last manufacturing operation) to Gryphon Investors for $107 million. (In 2006, Gryphon sold Eight O&#x27;Clock Coffee to Tata Global Beverages for $220 million).

In 2005, A&amp;P sold its 237-store Canadian division (consisting of A&amp;P, Dominion, Ultra Food and Drug stores, as well as the Canadian Food Basics units) to Montreal-based Metro Inc. for Can$1.7 billion in cash plus shares of Metro. By 2009, the &quot;A&amp;P&quot; name disappeared from these stores. In 2007, A&amp;P closed its New Orleans division, limiting A&amp;P&#x27;s footprint to the Northeast. Also in 2007, A&amp;P acquired Pathmark, a long-time Northeastern rival, for $1.4 billion (~$ in ). With this purchase, A&amp;P again became the largest supermarket operator in the New York City area. At the same time, Tengelmann reduced its shares to 38.5%, while the private equity firm Yucaipa, as major shareholder of Pathmark, acquired 27.5% of A&amp;P&#x27;s shares. In 2012, A&amp;P emerged from bankruptcy by becoming a private company, as Tengelmann ended its holding, and briefly returned to modest profitability in 2013 and 2014.

This allowed A&amp;P to regain its position as the largest grocery retailer in the New York City area, and the second-largest in the Philadelphia area. However, the Federal Trade Commission declared that as a result of the acquisition, A&amp;P would be a monopoly in parts of Long Island and Staten Island. As part of its settlement with the FTC, the corporation was forced to divest of some Waldbaum&#x27;s and Pathmarks.

When A&amp;P marked its 150th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked only No. 21 by &quot;Supermarket News&quot; of the top 75 North American grocery retailers based on 2008 fiscal year estimated sales of US$9.6 billion (~$ in ). Tengelmann held approximately 38.5 percent of A&amp;P, with Yucaipa holding a 27.5 percent share; the rest was held by individual shareholders and investor groups. Christian Haub was chairman. Eric Claus, then president and CEO, left A&amp;P, with Sam Martin assuming these responsibilities.

====First Chapter 11 bankruptcy (2010)====

The 2008 recession hit many supermarkets as customers migrated to discount markets in even greater numbers. A&amp;P was especially hard hit because of its increased debt load to complete the Pathmark purchase. In June 2010, A&amp;P stopped paying $150 million (~$ in ) in rent on the closed Farmer Jack stores. In August, A&amp;P announced that it would close another 25 stores in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania: 13 Pathmarks, 6 A&amp;Ps, 2 Waldbaum&#x27;s, and 4 Super Fresh stores. In September, A&amp;P announced it was selling seven Connecticut stores to Big Y.

On December 10, 2010, bankruptcy rumors surfaced; A&amp;P stock tumbled from over $3 per share to below $1 before trading was halted. Two days later, A&amp;P announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to documents submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, New York, A&amp;P listed over $2.5 billion in assets, and $3.2 billion in debt.

After the filing, A&amp;P remained in operation (with its stock symbol changed to GAPTQ) while it developed a reorganization plan. In November 2011, the corporation announced that it had entered into an agreement to receive $490 million (~$ in ) of debt and equity financing from Yucaipa, Mount Kellett Capital Management, and investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The agreement enabled A&amp;P to complete its restructuring and emerge from Chapter 11 as a private entity in early 2012. At this time, Christian Haub left A&amp;P, and Tengelmann wrote off its books the remaining equity.

====Second Chapter 11 bankruptcy and supermarket shutdown====
A&amp;P briefly returned to modest profitability by cutting costs in its remaining stores, although customer spending further decreased. In 2013, again a company, A&amp;P was put up for sale but could not find a suitable buyer. In January 2014, Sam Martin resigned. In March, Paul Hertz was named CEO and President as the company broke even. On January 15, 2015, the trade publication &quot;Supermarket News&quot; reported that A&amp;P was still for sale.

There were rumors of several parties being interested, including Cerberus, still owning Albertsons assets. However, no suitable offers were received. In May, rumors emerged that A&amp;P was in more financial trouble as it declared a huge loss (in April) for the previous year, losing more business to better-managed competition. As customers were staying away, A&amp;P considered its second bankruptcy filing in less than five years.

There were rumors that A&amp;P would sell all stores more than 40 miles from its corporate offices, shrinking the company to about 100 stores. Other rumors were that the company would sell all its stores. Rumors also surfaced about a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and total liquidation, selling the company in pieces, as well as a Chapter 11 bankruptcy with selling in pieces. The company remained for sale as a whole, receiving no bids for any of its stores. Other alternatives were explored, including selling other assets.

On July 19, 2015, A&amp;P filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, immediately closing 25 underperforming stores. The next day, A&amp;P announced that 76 of its stores (including Super Fresh and Pathmark units, as well as one Food Emporium unit) had been sold to Albertsons (owner of Philadelphia-based Acme Markets). Stop &amp; Shop purchased 25 units, mainly Pathmarks in New York City, Nassau and Suffolk counties. The Key Food co-operative acquired 23 units, mainly in New York City, including all remaining Food Basics and Food Emporium stores.

Morton Williams acquired two Food Emporium stores in Manhattan, while Wakefern Food Corporation, the cooperative which runs ShopRite and PriceRite, acquired 12 units, including 9 Pathmark stores. Local grocers also acquired units either through sales or auctions. All supermarkets were closed by November 25 (Thanksgiving eve). The last remaining portion of A&amp;P, &quot;Best Cellars at A&amp;P&quot;, had its stores auctioned in summer 2016, with 11 stores sold (none as going concerns) and 6 leases rejected.

==Store design==

The A&amp;P Historical Society describes early stores as &quot;resplendent emporiums&quot; painted in vermilion and equipped with a large gas light T sign. Interiors included crystal chandeliers, tin ceilings, and walls with gilt-edged Chinese panels. A clerk stood behind a long counter to serve customers (self-service did not become common until the 1930s), and the cashier&#x27;s station was shaped like a pagoda. When A&amp;P started offering premiums, the wall opposite the counter was equipped with large shelves to display the giveaways.

After John Hartford became responsible for marketing in the 1900s, A&amp;P began offering S&amp;H Green Stamps to free space for the expanded line of groceries available in the stores. The economy stores John Hartford developed in 1912 eliminated frills. Typically , these stores were equipped with basic shelving and a small ice box. A&amp;P agreed only to short leases so that it could quickly close unprofitable stores.

In the early 1920s, A&amp;P opened combination grocery/meat/produce stores eventually converting into supermarkets in the 1930s. On average, each supermarket replaced six older combination stores. A&amp;P&#x27;s policy of agreeing only to short-term leases resulted in differences in store design into the 1950s. During the mid-20th Century A&amp;P stores were considerably smaller in size than those of other chains. As late as 1971, half of the A&amp;P stores were under .

During the Scott era, store design was modernized and controlled from headquarters. A&amp;P developed four different-sized prototypes: , , , and . &quot;Family Mart&quot; stores were combination grocery/drug units with of floor space.

===Futurestore===
During the Wood era, A&amp;P developed the &quot;Futurestore&quot; concept; these supermarkets used black-and-white decor. &quot;Family Mart&quot; would serve as the testbed for the concept design.

Futurestore was one of two concepts A&amp;P launched during the 1980s (the other being Sav-A-Center; also defunct). Futurestore&#x27;s first supermarket was in the New Orleans area in 1984, where A&amp;P converted two Kroger stores it had acquired. The first conversion of an A&amp;P to the Futurestore format was in New Jersey in 1985.

The Futurestore concept spread to A&amp;Ps in the southeastern US, plus its traditional Mid-Atlantic region (operating in the Philadelphia area under the Super Fresh name), but, in the late 1980s, all Futurestores had been re-branded, or closed.

Like its sibling supermarket, Sav-A-Center, A&amp;P Futurestore was identified by its features and color scheme. The Futurestore interior was black and white, compared to the green and white of Sav-A-Center stores. Most Futurestores also had a glass atrium storefront. In addition, Futurestore signage featured pictograms, similar to those of European supermarkets.

Futurestores typically offered the latest in gourmet departments and electronic services in exclusive neighborhoods. Futurestore&#x27;s amenities were more gourmet- and specialty-oriented than found at a traditional A&amp;P or Sav-A-Center supermarket. Futurestores also had more modern fixtures and machinery than A&amp;Ps had at the time.

Since the concept was never adopted for a widespread rollout, A&amp;P phased out the Futurestore nameplate, closing some stores and converting others to A&amp;P or Sav-A-Center. Many customers felt Futurestore did not have the same panache of other upscale food retailers, which not only offered more gourmet products, but also cooked and delivered it. A&amp;P, however, did not immediately change the interior of the Futurestores, unlike its Sav-A-Centers, after A&amp;P began to rebrand them as A&amp;P Food Markets in the 1990s.

===Pharmacies===
In the mid-1990s, A&amp;P began adding pharmacies, concentrating on building units of to .

===Overseas ventures===
In the early 1980s there was discussion for A&amp;P to open a store in Saudi Arabia. A&amp;P Preservation reported in March 2018 that A&amp;P did open a store in Saudi Arabia, in Riyadh. Tengelmann Representative Petra Czech says that the name was licensed to Saudi operators. The store was most likely converted to the Saudi rendition of Safeway.

==Store names==

For most of its history, A&amp;P operated its stores under that name. That changed during the Scott and Wood eras when A&amp;P created chains, or used the original names of acquired chains. The following were A&amp;P&#x27;s retail operations under a different name:
*Family Mart: Started in 1977, this chain of large grocery stores/pharmacies was based on similar units built by Skaggs-Albertson&#x27;s when A&amp;P Chairman Scott worked for the latter. Initially successful, within 10 years Family Mart opened 28 units in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. The 18 Family Marts in Florida were sold in 1987 and the remaining Family Marts were closed by 1999.
*Plus: In Germany, Tengelmann operated many small stores under the &quot;Plus&quot; name, focusing on low-cost no-frills operations. After acquiring a majority stake of A&amp;P, Tengelmann converted some of A&amp;P&#x27;s smaller stores to the Plus concept.
*Super Fresh: When A&amp;P announced the closure of its Philadelphia division (which included Delaware, Maryland, and southern New Jersey) during the 1981–82 restructuring, the unions offered to buy many of these stores. A&amp;P agreed; the corporation and the unions settled on a new labor agreement that included a profit-sharing provision. The agreement also called for the stores to be operated under a new name, &quot;Super Fresh&quot;. These stores proved to be profitable, and in 1986 the name was extended to supermarkets in the District of Columbia, and Virginia; the latter included Richmond-area Pantry Pride stores A&amp;P purchased in 1981. Super Fresh stores were still in operation when A&amp;P began liquidation. In the subsequent auction, &quot;Super Fresh&quot; brand was acquired by Key Food and later re-launched, primarily in and around Newark, New Jersey, rather than its original Philadelphia footprint.
*Food Basics (US &amp; CA): In the early 2000s when the recession was hitting formerly prominent middle class areas, A&amp;P had recorded record losses for stores in New Jersey suburbs such as Paterson, North Bergen, and Glassboro. A&amp;P quickly turned around these unprofitable stores into a no-frills supermarket, called Food Basics. It offered the bare staples in the grocery department at a lower price. The stores featured both the America&#x27;s Choice and Food Basics storebrands, as well as the normal name brand items other A&amp;P-owned stores sold. By 2010, Food Basics operated more than a dozen stores in lower-class New Jersey cities, and several Super Fresh-turned-Food Basics stores in Central Philadelphia. The stores had no service departments except for a service deli. All other meats, seafood, and baked goods were produced off-premises, which cut A&amp;P&#x27;s labor costs in these stores by more than 50%, by taking out the higher-paying jobs of a butcher and baker, and replacing them with more stock clerks and cashiers.
*Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores: A&amp;P acquired the Wisconsin-based Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores in 1983 after closing A&amp;P&#x27;s large Chicago division in 1982. The first Kohl&#x27;s opened in 1946; during the 1960s it expanded into department stores. In 1972, Kohl&#x27;s was purchased by British American Tobacco, which decided to spin off the grocery stores to A&amp;P a decade later. A&amp;P closed Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores in 2003.
*Dominion (Canada): In 1985, A&amp;P acquired the Dominion chain in Canada, consisting of 92 supermarkets, 2 warehouses, and an office complex. Dominion was sold in 2005.
*Ultra Food &amp; Drug / Miracle Mart / The Barn Markets (Canada): A&amp;P acquired these two supermarket chains in Canada, and operated them until the chain&#x27;s demise in the early 2000s, and operated out of the same store styles of its counterparts.
*The Food Emporium: Also in 1985, this 26-store New York City-based chain was acquired by A&amp;P. Founded in 1919 as &quot;Daitch Crystal Dairies&quot; (later becoming &quot;Shopwell Supermarkets&quot;), the chain peaked at 103 stores in 1962. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Shopwell closed many of its stores and changed its name to &quot;The Food Emporium&quot; to focus on affluent areas. Food Emporium stores were still in operation through A&amp;P&#x27;s liquidation; Key Food acquired &quot;The Food Emporium&quot; and four stores, along with the &quot;Super Fresh&quot; brand, in the liquidation, maintaining use of the brands today.
*Waldbaum&#x27;s was acquired in 1986. The New York City-based chain was founded in 1904 and opened its first supermarket in 1951. The company quickly expanded from the city into Nassau and Suffolk counties, and later into Connecticut and Massachusetts. In the early 2000s, A&amp;P operated 80 Waldbaum&#x27;s in southernmost New York state (outside Manhattan). Many Waldbaum&#x27;s were still in operation when the company started liquidation, mainly in the Long Island area.
*Farmer Jack was a 79-store supermarket chain based in Detroit; it was purchased by A&amp;P in 1989. Farmer Jack started in 1924; in the mid-1950s its name was changed to &quot;Borman&#x27;s&quot;. These stores were renamed &quot;Farmer Jack&quot; in the late 1960s. In 1987, Farmer Jack was depleted of cash in a lengthy strike; it was sold in 1989 to A&amp;P for $76 million. Within five years, all A&amp;Ps in the Detroit area were converted to Farmer Jack, as were some A&amp;Ps in Virginia and South Carolina. By 2007, all Farmer Jack stores were sold or closed.
*Sav-A-Center: The Sav-A-Center name was first used for a chain of 20 supermarkets in the greater New Orleans, Louisiana, area. The division operated throughout Louisiana, and had two stores in Mississippi. In addition, the Sav-A-Center division included three regular A&amp;P stores, one of which was a small &quot;corner grocery&quot; in the French Quarter of New Orleans that A&amp;P had been operating since 1931. By August 2005, Sav-A-Center operated primarily in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans metropolitan areas, and along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Many stores sustained damage as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Twenty-one stores reopened within a few months of the storm; two others following remodeling to repair flood damage. Five stores were closed permanently due to severe damage to the stores and surrounding areas. In April 2007, the chain exited the Baton Rouge area. On May 30, 2007, A&amp;P confirmed that it was planning to exit the New Orleans area, and was seeking buyers for its 20 remaining Sav-A-Center stores. A&amp;P said the company cited its decision to focus on its remaining operations in the Northeast, where it operated the majority of its stores. It was announced in September 2007 that the remaining Sav-A-Center stores would be sold to the locally owned Rouses chain. Rouses took over 16 Sav-A-Center stores, including the Mississippi stores and the French Quarter A&amp;P, sold one to competing chain Breaux Mart, and closed the others.
*Pathmark was a large New York-area chain that was one of A&amp;P&#x27;s major competitors when it was acquired in 2007. Pathmark, originally known as &quot;Supermarkets General&quot;, was formed in 1956 as a subgroup of the Wakefern co-operative known as ShopRite. When Supermarkets General broke from ShopRite in 1968, it converted its 81 stores to Pathmark. By 1977, Pathmark started to build larger stores with pharmacies. To overcome a hostile takeover in 1987, Pathmark&#x27;s management instituted a leveraged buyout of $2.7 billion that committed it to make large debt payments. In 2000, Pathmark entered bankruptcy; after it was reorganized, Yucaipa Holding purchased 40% of Pathmark for $150 million. At the time of its 2007 purchase by A&amp;P, Pathmark operated 141 stores and had a capitalization of $634 million. Many Pathmark stores were still in operation when A&amp;P began liquidation. The brand has been sold to Foodtown, and in April 2019, a revived Pathmark (owned by Allegiance Retail Services) had opened in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn.

==Private brands==

When A&amp;P was founded, there were no branded food products, and retailers sold food commodities in bulk. In 1870, the company became among the first to sell a branded pre-packaged food product, introducing &quot;Thea-Necter&quot; brand tea. In 1885, the name &quot;A&amp;P&quot; was introduced on baking powder containers. Also in the 1880s, the company adopted the name &quot;Eight-O&#x27;Clock&quot; for its coffee. When A&amp;P moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1907, it included a bakery and coffee-roasting operation.

A&amp;P&#x27;s evolution into one of the country&#x27;s largest food manufacturers was the result of the 1915 court decision in the Cream of Wheat litigation that upheld the right of a manufacturer to set retail prices. To keep prices down, A&amp;P put emphasis on private label goods. By 1962, A&amp;P operated 67 plants before consolidating many of them into the 1.5 million-square foot Horseheads facility, which was the largest food manufacturing plant in the world under one roof. In his 1952 book, &quot;American Capitalism&quot;, John Kenneth Galbraith cited A&amp;P&#x27;s manufacturing strategy as a classic example of countervailing power that was a welcome alternative to state price controls.

As late as 1977, private label represented 25% of A&amp;P&#x27;s sales, with A&amp;P manufactured products accounting for over 40% of this total. That year, A&amp;P manufacturing reported sales of $750 million from its 23 plants(which by itself would have ranked A&amp;P&#x27;s manufacturing group at about number 350 in the Fortune 500).

Until the creation of a combined Manufacturing Group in 1975, the corporation&#x27;s production operations were conducted by four separate divisions:
*Bakery (Grandmother&#x27;s, Marvel, and Jane Parker): Until 1923, Jersey City was A&amp;P&#x27;s only bakery. A&amp;P rapidly expanded the division until it was America&#x27;s largest baker, with 37 plants. By 1977, the number of bakeries was reduced to seven; the division was closed during the 1981–82 restructuring. A Canadian baker continued to make Jane Parker cakes, but went bankrupt in 2014. Alex and Chris Ronacher took over the rights in 2016.
*Coffee (Eight O&#x27;Clock, Bokar, Red Circle): In 1919, A&amp;P consolidated its coffee business into the &quot;American Coffee Company&quot;, building roasting and grinding facilities. By 1977, A&amp;P owned three coffee roasting plants, and one for canned coffee. The coffee operation survived the 1981–82 restructuring, not sold until 2003.
*Dairy: This division dates to 1922 when A&amp;P purchased the White House Milk Company of West Bend, Wisconsin, to produce evaporated milk. At that time, grocers rarely sold fresh milk because of the lack of refrigeration. By 1977, the division operated three dairies, a cheese plant, and a dry milk plant.
*Grocery (Quaker Maid, Ann Page, Our Own Tea): In 1907, A&amp;P opened a vegetable cannery. After World War I, A&amp;P took advantage of the collapse of canned salmon prices to acquire canneries in Alaska. A&amp;P then acquired facilities to produce a wide range of canned goods, frozen foods, nuts, tea bags, pasta, peanut butter, detergents, insecticides, gelatin, paper goods, and candy. A&amp;P also operated a printing plant to produce labels and packaging for the other facilities, and promotional material for the stores. By 1977, A&amp;P operated the Horseheads plant, plus six smaller facilities.

In the mid-1990s, A&amp;P introduced a new simplified store brand called America&#x27;s Choice, which would last until the chain&#x27;s demise in 2015. (In Canada, the brand was called &quot;Master Choice&quot;. This same branding was used for A&amp;P&#x27;s gourmet items in its U.S. stores.)

In 2008 and 2009, the corporation added the environmentally-sensitive Green Way brand, gourmet Food Emporium Trading Company brand, and low-cost Food Basics alternative.

==&quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;==

What became &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; was started by A&amp;P in 1931, as a free leaflet with menus. In 1937, it was expanded into a magazine that was sold exclusively in A&amp;P stores, for 5 cents. Circulation reached 3 million in 1944 and 4 million by 1958, when the magazine was sold to Fawcett Publications.

*In the 1951 &quot;Popeye&quot; short &quot;Vacation With Play&quot;, the two squirrels in the cartoon originally spoke a transcribed radio announcement for an A&amp;P advertisement on Jane Parker&#x27;s Donuts. It can be heard only if slowing down the cartoon. Jane Parker is the name A&amp;P used when selling their own line of baked goods such as doughnuts and cookies.
*The store is the setting for John Updike&#x27;s 1961 short story, &quot;A&amp;P&quot;. 
*A&amp;P partnered with the Lifetime Network to produce the food-reality series &quot;Supermarket Superstar&quot; in 2013.

<doc id="744946" wikidata="Q399536" url="?curid=744946" title="Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne">
<text>Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne (October 12, 1853 – May 24, 1937) was an American politician, lawyer, and jurist who was the 38th mayor of Chicago from 1905 to 1907 and the 24th Governor of Illinois from 1913 to 1917. Dunne is the only person to be elected both Mayor of Chicago and Governor of Illinois. He also served as a judge of the Illinois circuit court for Cook County from 1892 to 1905.

==Early years==
Born in 1853, in Watertown, Connecticut, he was the son of an ardent Irish nationalist, Patrick William (P. W.) Dunne (1832–1921), who emigrated to America in 1849 after the failed Young Ireland revolt. After moving to the United States, his father remained an ardent backer of Irish independence. His mother, Delia Mary (Mary) Lawlor, was the daughter of a prosperous Irish contractor, and participant in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, who helped construct the docks of Galway.

The family moved to Peoria, Illinois in 1855 while Dunne was still an infant, and he was educated there in the public schools. Dunne had three sisters. His father refused to send his son to the local Catholic academy, because the Catholic Church had spoken out against the activities of the Fenians.

P. W. Dunne was a prosperous businessman, active in both Irish and American politics. He raised money for the Fenians, gave generously of his own funds, and frequently hosted Irish politicians, political exiles, and rebels in his home when they traveled to Chicago. P. W. Dunne served on the Peoria City Council in the 1860s and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives.

==Education and early career==
After Dunne graduated from high school in Peoria in 1871, he was sent to Ireland to attend Trinity College in Dublin. His father wanted his son to be educated at the alma mater of Irish patriot, Robert Emmet. Among his classmates was the author Oscar Wilde. Dunne did extremely well at Trinity, but was forced to leave one year short of graduation, after his father suffered a financial setback.

Dunne returned to Illinois, and finished his education at Union College of Law in Chicago (that was jointly run by Northwestern University and the Old University of Chicago), where his family had settled in 1877. He graduated from the Union College of Law in 1878. He married Elizabeth F. Kelly, the daughter of Edward F. Kelly, a Chicago businessman, and his wife, Kitty Howe Kelly, on August 16, 1881. Following his marriage he started a prosperous legal practice. The Dunnes had thirteen children, with nine of them surviving into adulthood. His children included: Eileen Dunne Corboy, Mona T. Leonard, Maurice Dunne, Richard Dunne, Jeanette Dunne, Edward F. Dunne, Jr., Geraldine Dunne, Eugene Dunne, and Judge Robert Jerome &quot;Duke&quot; Dunne.

==Circuit court judgeship==
In 1892, at age 28, Dunne was elected judge of Cook County Circuit Court and served from 1892 to 1905.

During his judgeship, he was also elected the first president of the Irish Fellowship Club of Chicago in 1901. He had played a key role in the formation of this organization, which championed Irish independence.

Cook County Circuit Court and Cook County Superior Court judges sat in the Cook County Criminal Court in one-month rotations. While sitting in the criminal court on such a rotation, Dunne had originally been assigned to preside over the high-profile trial of Patrick Eugene Prendergast for the murder (assassination) of Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison III On November 6, 1893, Dunne presided over a brief trial session in which the defense attorneys declared that they intended to plead insanity for Prendergast, and asked for a continuance until December 4 on the grounds that they lacked the time to prepare. Dunne granted this continuance. Since he rotated out of the criminal court by December, Judge Theodore Brentano ultimately presided over the trial instead.

In late 1901, Dunne was one of three judges presiding over a criminal conspiracy case against Illinois Democratic political boss Robert E. Burke. Burke had served as a Chicago municipal oil inspector under Chicago mayor Carter Harrison IV and was charged with a conspiracy related to $65,000 he accepted in compensation. Burke had acted in disregard of an agreement he had signed when taking the position to return the charges he collected in return for a flat compensation. Facing the prospect of charges, Burke returned $30,000 to the city in worries that not returning it might place himself in greater legal jeopardy. Conspiracy charges were brought against Burke by Charles S. Deneen, the Republican Cook County state&#x27;s attorney. Burke&#x27;s defense attorney, A. S. Trude, successfully used a defectively-constructed ordinance&#x27;s judicial construction to persuade Dunne and the other two judges (Theodore Brentano and Marcus Kavanaugh) to rule that the entire $65,000 was actually the rightful property of Burke and that he had actually unwittingly deprived himself of $30,000 of which he was entitled to hold by returning it to the city. Trude did this by arguing that Burke could not be criminally charged, because the city ordinance requiring the Chicago city oil inspector to give the city the fees he collected was, in fact, superseded by the state legislation that had established the position and its provision that allowed for the collection and the retention of all fees by the city oil inspector.

Another newsworthy trial that Dunne presided over was the 1895 trial of Alderman Charles Martin for alleged acceptance of bribes.

==Mayoralty==
Dunne resigned his judgeship to run for mayor in January 1905, winning election on April 4, 1905, beating the Republican John Maynard Harlan. Dunne won with majorities in 22 of 35 wards in the city. The final tally was 161,189 votes for Dunne and 138,671 given to Harlan. His election was greeted with jubilation by social reformers throughout the nation. He was formally inaugurated on April 10, 1905 in the council of chambers in Chicago. At the annual Jefferson Day banquet held shortly after his inauguration, he was praised by William Jennings Bryan and Mayor Tom L. Johnson as a dynamic new leader of the national movement for reform. The primary issue which Dunne had campaigned upon, and the primary issue he would focus on as mayor, was the city&#x27;s traction issue, for which he sternly favored having a solution which would result in immediate municipal ownership of the city&#x27;s streetcar lines. As his primary assistant, Dunne chose Clarence Darrow, who was given the title of &quot;Special Traction Counsel to the Mayor&quot;. After Darrow resigned from this role in November 1905, in 1906 Dunne appointed Walter L. Fisher as his replacement.

As Mayor, Dunne was instrumental in reducing the price of gasoline in Chicago from $1.00 to 85 cents, and of water from 10 cents to 7 cents per thousand gallons. He was also a strong proponent of municipal ownership of public utilities.
Dunne was defeated in his bid for reelection in 1907 by Republican Fred A. Busse.

A 1994 survey of experts on Chicago politics saw Dunne ranked as the tenth-best mayor in the city&#x27;s history up to that point.

==Post-mayoralty==
After his mayoralty ended on April 15, 1907, Dunne returned to his legal practice.

Dunne was narrowly defeated in the 1911 Democratic mayoral primary by another former Chicago mayor, Carter H. Harrison IV, who went on to regain the mayoralty.

==Governorship==

Dunne formally announced his candidacy for Governor of Illinois on January 17, 1912. He won the Democratic Party primary election held on April 9 of that year. The main thrust of his campaign attack was on what he called &quot;Jackpot Government&quot;. In the general election, Dunne defeated the incumbent governor, Governor Charles S. Deneen in the fall of 1912. Dunne and the Democrats benefited from the split in the ranks of the Republican Party which divided by supporters of the incumbent President William Howard Taft and the Progressives who supported the third party candidacy of Theodore Roosevelt.

He was inaugurated as Governor of Illinois on February 3, 1913. He moved his family to the Illinois Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Springfield, Illinois. As governor, he met with many visitors and guests. Former U.S. President Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Roosevelt was a visitor at the Illinois Governor&#x27;s Mansion while Dunne was governor.

As governor Dunne championed numerous progressive reforms, including Women&#x27;s Suffrage, prison reforms, major infrastructural improvements, the creation of the Public Utility Commission, the Efficiency and Economy Commission, the Legislative Reference Bureau, and he also expanded the state&#x27;s responsibility for overseeing workman&#x27;s compensation benefits and teachers&#x27; pensions.

In 1913, Governor Dunne signed into law a bill that gave women in the State of Illinois the right to vote for President of the United States. This made Illinois the first state east of the Mississippi to give women the right to vote for the U.S. Presidency. This was six years before the passage of the 19th Amendment.

In November 1915, Dunne designated state Senator Stephen D. Canady of Hillsboro to appear as his representative on the train car along with the Liberty Bell as it passed through southern Illinois on its nationwide tour returning to Pennsylvania from the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. After that trip, the Liberty Bell returned to Pennsylvania and will not be moved again.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
In 1919, Dunne traveled to the Paris Peace Conference to lobby President Woodrow Wilson to consider Irish independence to be a cause in keeping with the principle of self-determination that Wilson had advocated for in his &quot;Fourteen Points&quot;.

After finishing his term as governor, Dunne remained politically active. In 1921, he helped found an organization called the &quot;National Unity Council&quot; to combat the Ku Klux Klan.

In 1919, Dunne was appointed by the Irish Race Convention to serve on the American Commission on Irish Independence. As part of this commission, Dunne traveled to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 in order to voice Irish-American desires for an independent Irish nation. During his stay in Europe, he also visited Ireland itself. He spent ten days touring the island and meeting with politicians including members of the First Dáil on May 9, 1919.

Dunne returned once again to practicing law after leaving office in 1917. His legal practice was damaged by the ravages of the Great Depression, but he supplemented this work with a position as counsel to the Cook County Board of Election Commissioners.

After the death of his wife on May 25, 1928, Dunne began contemplating his memoirs. He was convinced by the Lewis Publishing Co. to write a history of Illinois. Over a five-year period he worked on this project with close help from William L. Sullivan, who had been his private secretary when he was governor. In 1933, he published a five (5) volume set titled: &quot;Illinois, the Heart of the Nation&quot;.

President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Dunne to be a United States Commissioner for the Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair of Chicago of 1933-34. At the time he was 80 years old. He took great joy in this position and joked that he had served as mayor, governor and as a federal commissioner (and, thus, had served at all levels of government).

==Death==
In his later years, Dunne lived with his oldest daughter, Eileen and her family. He died in Chicago on May 24, 1937, aged 83. He was surrounded by three of his nine children when he died. He is buried alongside his wife Elizabeth at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston. Dunne’s family today reside in Chicago, Connecticut, and New Jersey.

<text>Finley Peter Dunne (born Peter Dunne; July 10, 1867 – April 24, 1936) was an American humorist, journalist and writer from Chicago. In 1898 Dunne published &quot;Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War&quot;, his first collection of the nationally syndicated Mr. Dooley sketches. Written as though speaking with the thick verbiage and accent of an Irish immigrant from County Roscommon, Dunne&#x27;s fictional &quot;Mr. Dooley&quot; expounded upon political and social issues of the day from behind the bar of his South Side Chicago Irish pub. Dunne&#x27;s sly humor and political acumen won the support of President Theodore Roosevelt, a frequent target of Mr. Dooley&#x27;s barbs. Dunne&#x27;s sketches became so popular and such a of public opinion that they were read each week at White House cabinet meetings.

Born to Irish immigrant parents and raised in Chicago, Dunne went to work for newspapers as a teenager. In the late 19th century, he and Eugene Field garnered attention for the humorous columns they separately published in the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. Dunne also continued as a reporter, often covering politics, moving to a series of Chicago papers.

== Childhood and early career ==
Peter Dunne (he later added as his first name Finley, his mother&#x27;s maiden name) was born in Chicago on July 10, 1867, to Ellen Finley and Peter Dunne, a carpenter, both of whom had been born in Ireland. He was born with his twin brother John, who died in infancy. Peter was the fifth of the seven Dunne children who would survive to adulthood. Ellen Dunne was well-read, and created a bookish environment for her children. The Dunne family had many Catholic priests and one such relative suggested the bright boy be trained as a clergyman, but the elder Peter Dunne refused, saying there would be no children forced to become priests in his family. Recognizing Peter&#x27;s potential, his parents sent him to high school, the only Dunne boy to attend. His mother had become ill with tuberculosis as young Peter finished grade school and she died while he was at West Division High School. Likely due to his loss, Dunne finished last in his class, though he shone in the school&#x27;s literary society and as a debater. Dunne had taken the college-track curriculum at West Division, but his poor grades scuttled any such plans. He found a job as office boy at the Chicago &quot;Telegram&quot; and started work there in 1884, just before his seventeenth birthday.

Through his relatives and as a local boy, Dunne was thoroughly familiar with the local police courts and firehouses. When superiors realized he could write, he was promoted to reporter and sent to cover the police department. His writing talent became clear to newspaper rivals perusing the pages of the &quot;Telegram&quot;, and &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; managing editor Harry Ten Eyck White lured him away in 1885 at an increase in salary. The &quot;Telegram&quot; barely made ends meet; the &quot;Daily News&quot; was by far the most successful newspaper in Chicago. Instead of longer editorials, White preferred pithy comments ranging from sentence to paragraph length, and gave Dunne training in this. Some of the elements of Dunne&#x27;s experience at the &quot;Daily News&quot; may have resonated in his later Mr. Dooley pieces. Editor White, a humorist of local note and a racing fan, had invented a character, &quot;the horse reporter&quot;, who dispensed earthy wisdom to a Chicago newsroom&#x27;s visitors, and had written a series of sketches about an Irish family living on Archer Avenue, Dooley&#x27;s future home. Also on the &quot;Daily News&quot; staff was Eugene Field, a humorist and easily the best-paid journalist in Chicago from the 1880s until his 1895 death. Field&#x27;s work tended to be noncontroversial, contrasting with the Dooley pieces, but Field&#x27;s success proved that newspaper humor could pay.

Editor White assigned Dunne to general news reporting and tried to allow him to write special features, which he preferred, disliking the need for legwork in general reporting. Sometime before 1886 Dunne had taken his mother&#x27;s maiden name as his middle name, and in 1888, reversed the two names, for Finley Peter Dunne.

Dunne&#x27;s city was at this time baseball-mad over the success of the Chicago White Stockings, and in the spring of 1887, the &quot;Daily News&quot; started covering baseball games (rather than merely printing the final score). White assigned Dunne. Both at home games and on the road, Dunne sent commentary, usually of the first six innings or so, the most that could be set in type before the six o&#x27;clock edition, the final one for the day (the scores from the later innings were punched into the printing plate). According to James DeMuth in his book on Chicago newspaper humorists, Dunne, together with &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; sports reporter Charles Seymour, &quot;largely shaped the modern forms of American sportswriting&quot;. Rather than dry summaries, as had been common to that point, Seymour and Dunne adopted ballplayer slang as technical terms. One term that Dunne is credited with coining is &quot;southpaw&quot; to describe a left-handed pitcher; in the White Stockings ballpark, a pitcher faced west as he threw to the plate there; thus he threw with the arm on the south side. Dunne was no baseball fan, and saw that many players were well-muscled, but ignorant; this would cause his most famous literary creation, Mr. Dooley, to remark of one young player&#x27;s career, &quot;fractions drove him from school, and the vagrancy laws drove him to baseball&quot;.

In January 1888, Dunne was hired away from the &quot;Daily News&quot; by the &quot;Chicago Times&quot;. That paper had been in decline since the death of its longtime editor, Wilbur F. Storey and new management was seeking to revitalize its staff by raiding other papers. Dunne saw the potential for further advancement in an election year. Historian Charles Fanning deemed Dunne&#x27;s coverage of the Republican and Democratic national conventions &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; management must have agreed, for they made him city editor, although only aged 21.

== More accomplishments ==
Dunne was city editor for less than a year before leaving for a position at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. During that time the &quot;Times&quot; published a number of pieces containing Irish dialect, although their authorship cannot be ascribed to Dunne with certainty, as they do not bear a byline. It was while holding that position that Dunne had his greatest scoop: breaking the Cronin case. Alexander Sullivan, local head of the Clan-na-Gael, was borrowing funds from it for market speculation, something loudly opposed by a member, Dr. John Patrick Cronin, who subsequently vanished after climbing into a vehicle of men who said his services were needed. Few took much note of the doctor&#x27;s absence until Dunne learned of the Clan situation, which had escaped press notice. Dunne pushed for an investigation of Cronin&#x27;s disappearance, and a police detective, Daniel Coughlin, was assigned, who did little work on the incident before announcing there was no evidence of foul play, and continued his indolence once Cronin&#x27;s badly beaten body was discovered. Dunne became suspicious of the policeman and had him watched. Through contacts, Dunne discovered that Coughlin had hired a horse and buggy matching the description of that which had taken Cronin, and stopped the presses. Coughlin was arrested, but his murder conviction was reversed on appeal, and he was acquitted in a retrial. Despite his journalistic coup, Dunne was forced out at the &quot;Times&quot; due to a power struggle among the publishers. His next post at the &quot;Tribune&quot;, as a reporter, was a step down.

About the time Dunne moved to the &quot;Tribune&quot;, he and other young Chicago journalists formed the Whitechapel Club, named for the locale of the crimes of Jack the Ripper. The club attracted attention for its stunts, including two semi-humorous mayoral campaigns and the midnight cremation of a member who had committed suicide that was well covered in the papers. The club provided the venue for frank political discussions among members who generally were far more progressive than their employers, and the young journalists bluntly critiqued each other&#x27;s writing. Dunne was one of those who specialized in deflating the self-important, as would Mr. Dooley in the years to come. His biographer, Fanning, found that &quot;the Whitechapel experience was crucial in Dunne&#x27;s development as a thinker and a writer&quot;.

Six months at the &quot;Tribune&quot; saw Dunne gain promotion to editor of the Sunday edition soon after the start of 1890. This relieved him of the drudgery of the daily reporter&#x27;s beat, which he disliked. Before the end of the year, he moved again, this time to the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot;—publisher John R. Walsh and editor James W. Scott were building a staff composed mainly of enthusiastic younger journalists, including Dunne&#x27;s old colleague from the ballpark, Seymour. Several Whitechapel members were there, as was future politician Brand Whitlock, who later wrote, &quot;when they induced &#x27;Pete&#x27; Dunne to come over from the &quot;Tribune&quot;, the staff seemed complete&quot;. Another reason Dunne was willing to jump papers was that he would have the opportunity to do political reporting.

Although hired as a reporter, not an editor, Dunne&#x27;s experience and competence quickly placed him high on the &quot;Tribune&quot; staff. Dunne got to do political work, covering the 1892 Democratic and Republican conventions. He also had to do work he found less interesting—the young Theodore Dreiser, assigned like Dunne to cover a florists&#x27; convention, noted that Dunne seemed to scorn not only the event, but the fact he was assigned to cover it. Despite his affected nonchalance during such assignments, Dunne still turned in brilliant copy.

Dunne was transferred to the Walsh-owned &quot;Chicago Evening Post&quot; after the 1892 conventions and was put in charge of its editorial page under the paper&#x27;s editor, Cornelius McAuliff. There, he met his future mother-in-law, Mary Perkins Ives Abbott, who reviewed books for the &quot;Evening Post&quot;. Another biographer, Ellis, noted that Abbott, a widow who had lived for some years in Calcutta, was the wittiest woman Dunne had ever met and that she recognized his genius. The acquaintance with Abbott, who was a popular dinner guest in Chicago society, launched Dunne into those circles. With those connections and his continued fine writing, Dunne became prominent in Chicago. Assigned by his paper to cover the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, the city appointed him as its representative at a number of events there that had an Irish connection.

== Dooley origins ==

The first Dooley articles appeared when Dunne was chief editorial writer for the &quot;Chicago Post&quot;, and for a number of years, he wrote the pieces without a byline or initials. They were paid for at the rate of $10 each above his newspaper pay. A contemporary wrote of his Mr. Dooley sketches that &quot;there was no reaching for brilliancy, no attempt at polish. The purpose was simply to amuse. But it was this very ease and informality of the articles that caught the popular fancy. The spontaneity was so genuine; the timeliness was so obvious.&quot; In 1898, he wrote a Dooley piece that celebrated the victory of Commodore George Dewey over the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay—and this piece attracted national attention. Within a short time, weekly Dooley essays were syndicated across the country.

In 1899, under the title &quot;Mr Dooley in Peace and War&quot;, a collection of the pieces was brought out in book form, received rave reviews from the critics. It was on the best seller list for a year. Dunne moved to New York as a full-time writer and national literary figure. Selections from Dooley were read at meetings of the presidential cabinet.

Theodore Roosevelt was a fan, despite the fact that he was one of Dunne&#x27;s favorite targets. When Roosevelt published his book, &quot;The Rough Riders&quot;, Dunne wrote a tongue-in-cheek review mocking the war hero with the punchline &quot;if I was him I&#x27;d call th&#x27; book &#x27;Alone in Cubia&#x27;&quot; and the nation roared. Roosevelt wrote to Dunne: &quot;I regret to state that my family and intimate friends are delighted with your review of my book. Now I think you owe me one; and I shall expect that when you next come east you pay me a visit. I have long wanted the chance of making your acquaintance.&quot;

The two finally met at the Republican Convention in 1900, where Roosevelt, then governor of New York, gave him a news scoop—he would accept the nomination as vice presidential candidate. In later years, Dunne was a frequent guest for dinner and weekends at the White House.

Dunne wrote more than 700 Dooley pieces, about a third of which were printed in eight books. Their era of influence ended with the start of World War I. After Dooley became popular, Dunne had left Chicago and lived in New York, where he wrote books and articles and edited &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, becoming a beloved figure in club and literary circles.

Dunne&#x27;s &quot;Dooley&quot; essays were based on realistic depictions of working-class life, and did not reflect the idealism of most political commentators of the Progressive Era. Fanning says:
:Dunne did not share the faith... in progressive reform. He viewed the world as fallen and essentially unimprovable, and many Dooley pieces reflect their author&#x27;s tendency toward fatalism.

== Personal life ==
On December 10, 1902, Dunne married the daughter of his social mentor Mary Abbott, Margaret Ives Abbott (1878–1955), who, like her mother, was a well-known society woman in Chicago and a prominent golfer. Both were among the competitors in the sport at the 1900 Olympics, Margaret being the event champion (but not the gold medal winner, as those were not awarded at the time). She continued to play golf while she and Dunne were raising their four children, Finley Peter Dunne Jr., screenwriter and director Philip Dunne, and twins Peggy and Leonard.

Dunne died in New York on April 24, 1936.

== Legacy ==
Dunne&#x27;s historical significance was apparent at the time of his death. Elmer Ellis, historian at (and later president of) the University of Missouri, wrote a biography of Dunne that was published in 1941.

A sports bar in Chicago&#x27;s Lakeview neighborhood is named after him.

=== Often quoted aphorisms ===
Over the years, he coined numerous political quips. One of the best-known aphorisms he originated is &quot;politics ain&#x27;t beanbag&quot;, referring to the rough side of political campaigns.

As a journalist in the age of &quot;muckraking journalism&quot;, Dunne was aware of the power of institutions, including his own. Writing as Dooley, Dunne once wrote the following passage, a parody of the Catholic catechism list of Works of Mercy, mocking hypocrisy and self-importance in the newspapers themselves:

The &quot;afflicts the comfortable&quot; expression has been borrowed and altered in many ways over the years:

*Clare Boothe Luce employed a variation of it in a tribute to Eleanor Roosevelt, &quot;Mrs. Roosevelt has done more good deeds on a bigger scale for a longer time than any woman who ever appeared on the public scene. No woman has ever so comforted the distressed — or so distressed the comfortable.&quot;
*A version showed up in a line delivered by Gene Kelly in the 1960 film, &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. Kelly (E.K. Hornbeck) says, &quot;Mr. Brady, it is the duty of a newspaper to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable&quot;.
*Appalachian political activist and attorney Larry Harless, known best for his numerous attempts to derail funding for Pullman Square often stated that he tried &quot;to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable&quot;.
*The American poet Lucille Clifton is quoted often as saying that she aimed in her poetry to &quot;comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable&quot;.

<doc id="744956" wikidata="Q503809" url="?curid=744956" title="Jean de Dunois">
<text>Jean d&#x27;Orléans, Count of Dunois (23 November 1402 – 24 November 1468), known as the &quot;Bastard of Orléans&quot; () or simply Jean de Dunois, was a French military leader during the Hundred Years&#x27; War who participated in military campaigns with Joan of Arc. His nickname, the &quot;Bastard of Orléans&quot;, was a mark of his high status, since it acknowledged him as a first cousin to the king and acting head of a cadet branch of the royal family during his half-brother&#x27;s captivity. In 1439 he received the county of Dunois from his half-brother Charles, Duke of Orléans, and later King Charles VII made him count of Longueville.

==Life==
Jean was the illegitimate son of Louis I, Duke of Orléans – son of King Charles V of France – and his mistress Mariette d&#x27;Enghien. In 1407, Jean&#x27;s father, Louis I, Duke of Orléans was assassinated. Eight years later, his half-brother, Charles, Duke of Orléans was captured at the Battle of Agincourt. He remained a prisoner of the English for twenty-five years. This left Jean the only adult male to represent the house of Orléans. He was Knight of the Order of the Porcupine.

Jean took part in the civil war in France during the reign of Charles VI on the side of the Armagnacs, and was captured by the Burgundians in 1418. Released in 1420, he entered the service of the Dauphin Charles, fighting in the Hundred Years&#x27; War against English forces. In 1427, Jean, along with Arthur of Richemont and Etienne of Vignolles, forced the Earl of Warwick to raise his siege of Montargis. He was wounded, the next year, at the battle of Rouvray. Jean led the French defenses at the siege of Orléans, and together with Joan of Arc relieved the siege. He joined her on the campaigns of 1429 and remained active after her death.

Jean attended Charles VII&#x27;s coronation in July 1429 and in 1436 aided in the recapture of Paris. In 1439 he was made Count of Dunois. He was prominent in the conquest of Guienne and Normandy in the final years of the Hundred Years War.

Jean participated in the Praguerie revolt against Charles VII and was a leader of the League of the Public Weal against King Louis XI in 1465, but each time he regained favor at court.

==Marriages and progeny==
He married Marie Louvet (d. 1426) in April 1422 at Bourges, by whom he had no children.

He married a second time to Marie of Harcourt (d. 1464), Lady of Parthenay 26 October 1439 and had four children:
# Jean (1443-1453)
# François Ι d&#x27;Orléans-Longueville (1447–1491), Count of Dunois, Tancarville, Longueville, and Montgomery, married 2 July 1466 to Agnès of Savoy (1445–1508). One of their children was Louis I d&#x27;Orléans, duc de Longueville.
# Marie (1440-?), married 1466 to Louis de la Haye, Lord of Passavant and Mortagne.
# Catherine d&#x27;Orléans (1449–1501), married 14 May 1468 to Johann VII of Saarbrücken-Commercy (1430–1492), Count of Roucy without issue.

==Titles==
* Lord of Valbonais (1421–1468)
* Count of Mortain (1424–1425)
* Viscount of Saint-Sauveur
* Count of Périgord (1430–1439)

<text>William von Eggers Doering (June 22, 1917 – January 3, 2011) was the Mallinckrodt Professor of Chemistry at Harvard University. Before Harvard, he taught at Columbia (1942–1952) and Yale (1952–1968).

Doering was born in Fort Worth, Texas to academics Carl Rupp Doering and Antoinette Mathilde von Eggers, both of whom were professors at Texas Christian University. His maternal great-uncle was the prominent German financier and economist Hjalmar Schacht, sometime President of the &quot;Reichsbank&quot; and cabinet minister in Nazi Germany.

Doering was an undergraduate at Harvard University, where he took courses with some of the leading organic chemists at the time, including Louis Fieser and Paul Doughty Bartlett. He stayed at Harvard for his graduate education, where he studied catalytic hydrogenation under Reginald Linstead, completing his PhD in 1943. Before beginning his independent career, he became famous for completing a (formal) quinine total synthesis with Robert Burns Woodward as a postdoctoral scholar, a wartime achievement that was publicized at the time by the national news media, including TIME magazine. Subsequently, during an independent career at Columbia, Yale, and Harvard that spanned over half a century, he made numerous contributions to the field of physical organic chemistry.

Having published his first scientific paper in 1939 and his last in 2008, he holds the rare distinction of having authored scholarly articles in eight different decades. In 1989, he received the &quot;James Flack Norris Award in Physical Organic Chemistry&quot; of the American Chemical Society and in 1990 the Robert A. Welch Award in Chemistry.

Some of his major contributions include recognition of the aromatic nature of the tropylium cation and the early use of 1H NMR for the characterization of carbocations and other reactive intermediates, including heptamethylbenzenium cation, investigation of the stereochemistry of the Cope rearrangement, and pioneering work in carbene chemistry, including the discovery of dichlorocarbene. Some other notable work include the synthesis of fulvalene, the discoveries of the Doering-LaFlamme allene synthesis and the Parikh-Doering oxidation, prediction of the existence of bullvalene as a fluxional molecule, and elucidation of the mechanism of the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation. Together with H. H. Zeiss, he proposed the Doering-Zeiss mechanistic hypothesis for solvolysis reactions. He first articulated the notion that cyclic systems with (4&quot;n&quot; + 2) π-electrons exhibit aromatic stability (the modern form of Hückel&#x27;s rule) and coined the term &quot;carbene&quot; in collaboration with Woodward and Winstein during a nocturnal cab ride in Chicago.

Doering became emeritus in 1986, but continued to advise graduate students and publish.

<text>&quot;Doppelgangland&quot; is the sixteenth episode of the third season of the fantasy television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). It was written and directed by the show&#x27;s creator, Joss Whedon, and originally aired on The WB in the United States on February 23, 1999. The episode&#x27;s title is derived from the term &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;, a German word for a lookalike or double of a living person.

&quot;Doppelgangland,&quot; a very popular episode, revisits the alternate reality portrayed in &quot;The Wish&quot;, in which Buffy never arrived in Sunnydale and vampires ruled the city. Anya, a vengeance demon who previously granted the wish, attempts a spell to regain her amulet and with it her powers.

==Plot==
Anya unsuccessfully entreats D&#x27;Hoffryn to restore her demonic powers.

Principal Snyder browbeats Willow into tutoring basketball star Percy West. At Giles&#x27;s request, Willow hacks into Mayor Wilkins&#x27;s files; when Faith finds out, she alerts him of the intrusion. The Mayor presents Faith with a fully furnished apartment and then tells her he plans to have Willow killed.

Percy makes it clear that his idea of tutoring is that Willow should do his homework, and Willow does not correct him. Frustrated and unhappy, Willow then quarrels with Buffy and Xander, telling them that she feels rebellious and may change her look and behavior, and storms off. Assisting Anya with a spell to retrieve a lost amulet, Willow&#x27;s conjuration goes awry and instead summons an alternate Vampiric version of herself. (This alternate reality was created by Cordelia&#x27;s wish that Buffy never came to Sunnydale in the episode The Wish). Neither Anya nor Willow realize the consequences of their spell.

Vampire Willow sees Sunnydale is a lot different. No one is afraid of her and there are more humans than vampires, which means the city is peaceful and corruption-free. Vampire Willow goes to the Bronze, where she fights with Percy and throws him across the pool table. Vampire Willow runs into her old lover Xander and realizes that he is alive. She also sees Buffy who is alive and despises her. She shows her vampire face to Xander and Buffy. Two vampires sent by the Mayor attack her, but she turns them to her side. Buffy and Xander tell Giles that Willow has been killed and turned vampire, but the genuine Willow arrives to demonstrate their error. None of them are aware of Vampire Willow&#x27;s true origins.

Angel and Anya drop into the Bronze, where Oz is with the band onstage. Vampire Willow and her new minions arrive and capture the crowd. Angel escapes to find Buffy. Anya recognizes what has happened, offers to restore Vampire Willow to her own world in return for help in retrieving her amulet, and suggests capturing the other Willow to assist in the spell. Angel, Buffy and Xander head for the Bronze, but Willow turns back to get the tranquilizer gun and is grabbed by her doppelgänger. Willow manages to shoot the vampire with the tranquilizer gun. The others arrive back in the library (presumably having seen Vamp Willow in the school) and they lock the unconscious vampire in the library cage, then Willow exchanges clothes with her in an attempt to pass herself off as Doppel-Willow. They return to the Bronze.

Cordelia arrives at the library and unwittingly releases Vampire Willow, who immediately attacks her, but Wesley intervenes and drives the vampire away. At the Bronze, although Anya exposes Willow&#x27;s disguise, Buffy defeats the other vampires, then captures the doppelgänger. Anya returns vampire Willow to her own timeline, where the alternate Oz immediately kills her before the reality erases. The next day, Percy, thoroughly intimidated by Willow&#x27;s doppelgänger (and believing she was the real Willow), shows up for tutoring with all his work completed and makes it clear he intends to please her from now on.

==Reception==
When the episode was originally broadcast in the United States on February 23, 1999, it received a Nielsen rating of 4.1. It was the second most watched program of the week on The WB Television Network.

&quot;Doppelgangland&quot; primarily focuses on the character Willow. Series creator Joss Whedon has placed it fifth in his list of favorite episodes from the show, stating &quot;one Willow is certainly not enough.&quot; Malinda Lo from AfterEllen.com included the episode in her top ten as well. Alyson Hannigan, who portrays the character Willow, also considers the episode to be one of her favorites in the series.

Billie Doux, giving the episode 4 out of 4 stakes, writes, &quot;Evil double plots are done to death, but they can be marvelous when they&#x27;re done well. And this one was done exceptionally well. It was very clever and very funny, with one liners coming thick and fast and everyone wonderfully in character. Alyson Hannigan again did a superb job as Willow, vamp Willow, and Willow &quot;playing&quot; vamp Willow.&quot;

According to TV.com, the episode holds an average score of 9.5/10, based on 658 compiled ratings. &quot;Vox&quot;, rating it at #13 in a list of all 144 episodes, writes, &quot;Watching Willow wrestle with an alternate-reality version of herself is even better when you know what’s to come in later seasons (&quot;Hands! Hands!&quot;), and it would be an understatement to say that Alyson Hannigan shines in both roles. We also get our first look at Anya since she lost her powers — impatient and frustrated and unable to even order a beer — which is endearing even though she nearly sabotages the gang’s plan to save the day.&quot;

Noel Murray from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; commented that the episode &quot;is terrific on myriad levels, from the dialogue to the plot twists to the multiple spot-on character moments. But mostly it&#x27;s a top-drawer episode for the way it binds the Buffyverse together, by demonstrating how adept the writing staff is at remembering everything they&#x27;ve done on the show before, and re-using the elements that still have plenty of juice in them.&quot;

<doc id="744977" wikidata="Q1972978" url="?curid=744977" title="Upper Klamath Lake">
<text>Upper Klamath Lake (sometimes called Klamath Lake) (Klamath: ?ews, &quot;lake&quot;) is a large, shallow freshwater lake east of the Cascade Range in south-central Oregon in the United States. The largest body of fresh water by surface area in Oregon, it is approximately long and wide and extends northwest from the city of Klamath Falls. It sits at an average elevation of .

In the early 20th century, most of the wetlands and marshes surrounding the lake were drained for agricultural purposes, damaging the larger habitat. The lake&#x27;s water has been used to support the federal Klamath Project for irrigation by local farmers for a century. The lake depth fluctuates due to regulation of its water supply, averaging between deep. The lake level is kept within above sea level to ensure a viable fishery in the lake and to protect coho salmon in the Klamath River below the lake.

Upper Klamath Lake is fed by a watershed of including the Williamson and Wood Rivers, and is drained by the Klamath River (known here as the Link River), which issues from the south end of the lake. The lake is connected by a short channel to the smaller Agency Lake to the north. The Upper Klamath National Wildlife Refuge has been established on land along the northern edge of the lake to preserve natural habitat.

==Geology==
Upper Klamath Lake is the largest remnant of Lake Modoc, a giant pluvial lake that existed in the region until about 10,000 years ago. At its largest, Lake Modoc covered over , joining Upper Klamath, Lower Klamath, and Tule Lakes, as well as all of the major wetlands in the upper Klamath River basin, into a contiguous body of water. The lake was more than ten times the size of present-day Upper Klamath Lake and sat nearly higher in elevation. Lake Modoc disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene due to a warming and drying climate.

==History==
The region around Upper Klamath Lake and the Williamson, Sprague and Wood rivers to the north of the lake were originally inhabited by the Klamath people. The Modoc people inhabited the lands to the south of Upper Klamath Lake, around the Lower Klamath and Tule lakes.

The first recorded persons of European descent to visit Upper Klamath Lake were a party of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trappers commanded by Peter Skene Ogden in December 1826. Ogden called the lake &quot;Dog Lake&quot;, after obtaining nine dogs from the local Klamaths for food. They explored the lake and the Klamath River headwaters, helped by native guides. However, they did not stay in the area for long, instead moving south to tributaries of the Klamath River in search of beaver.

Animosity between American immigrants and Native Americans led to armed conflicts. In 1846, a military expedition led by John C. Frémont and Kit Carson were attacked by Native American warriors near Upper Klamath Lake. In revenge, Frémont and Carson&#x27;s party attacked a local village, killing fourteen people.

As more settlers entered the region, the Modoc people resisted by raiding parties along the South Emigrant Trail, which passed through the Klamath River Valley south of Upper Klamath Lake. In 1873, the Native Americans were defeated in the Modoc War, and were relocated to a reservation on the north side of the lake.

Being naturally eutrophic, the lake has been known since early times for its poor water quality. Frémont noted the &quot;often foul smelling waters&quot; of the lake, and the Applegate Trail was purposely routed away from the lake because the water was &quot;so bad that it might be too dangerous for livestock to drink late in the season&quot;.

Starting in the mid-1800s, the valleys both north and south of Upper Klamath were settled and developed for agriculture. Since 1917, the water level in the lake has been regulated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation (BOR)&#x27;s Link River Dam as part of the Klamath Reclamation Project, to supply irrigation waters to support agriculture in the upper Klamath Basin. The original timber crib dam was replaced by a more permanent concrete structure in 1921.

==Ecology==
Prior to the 20th century, the lake was surrounded by widespread marshes and wetlands, which supported fish, birds and wildlife, as well as protecting water quality in the lake. Much of these important habitats were drained to be converted to cultivated farmland, as farmers did not understand the value of the wetlands for the environment. The lake is naturally eutrophic, due to a high concentration of nutrients. In the 20th century, the augmentation of nutrients by agricultural runoff from the surrounding farming valley has caused the lake to become hypereutrophic, resulting in blue-green algae blooms over the lake (largely &quot;Aphanizomenon flos-aquae&quot;). The algae blooms turn the water an opaque green in the summer and reduce the opportunity for recreational uses of the lake. State standards for dissolved oxygen are routinely violated, meaning that fish are endangered. The lake is still a vital stop for waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway, and is known for its rainbow trout fishery.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is responsible for protecting and maintaining sucker populations in the lake. In 1988, the FWS placed the Lost River sucker and the shortnose sucker (&quot;Catostomidae&quot;) on the federal endangered species list; the numbers of the two formerly abundant Upper Klamath Lake fish species had sharply fallen due to the decline in water quality. As a result, the government abandoned a planned dredging project, which would have further damaged the water quality. The project was to dredge a deeper navigation channel from one end of the lake to the other; it was planned between several government agencies and Aqua Farm&#x27;s Inc.

A drought in the summer of 2001 heightened environmental concerns about the lake. The BOR stopped withdrawing irrigation water for the Klamath Project in order to protect the sucker population. The farming community protested, as they depended on a supply of lake waters for their operations. As of 2003, the FWS was monitoring the lake regularly due to water shortfalls, which endangered both fish in the lake and salmon in the Klamath River. The future uses of Klamath Lake are of national interest because of competing claims between farmers&#x27; property rights (supported by federal subsidies and programs) and larger environmental goals.

<doc id="744982" wikidata="Q3501445" url="?curid=744982" title="Clifford Dupont">
<text>Clifford Walter Dupont (6 December 190528 June 1978) was a British-born Rhodesian politician who served in the internationally unrecognised positions of officer administrating the government (from 1965 until 1970) and president (from 1970 to 1975). Born in London and qualifying as a solicitor, Dupont served during the Second World War as an officer of the British Royal Artillery in North Africa before first visiting Southern Rhodesia in 1947. He returned a year later, started a ranch and emigrated full-time during the early 1950s, by which time the country had become a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

When Rhodesia&#x27;s government under Ian Smith issued the Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, Dupont, as Deputy Prime Minister, was the second to sign. Smith attempted to have Dupont named as Governor-General in place of the British-appointed Governor, Humphrey Gibbs, but failing this instead made him Officer Administering the Government. He held this post until 1970, when he became President following the declaration of a republic. After suffering from ill health during this last appointment, he retired at 1976 and died in 1978.

==Early life==
Of Huguenot ancestry, Dupont was born in London on 6 December 1905, to Alfred Walter and Winifred Mary Dupont into a family which consisted of two older brothers and an elder, and subsequently a younger sister. His father founded a commercial firm dealing largely in the &quot;rag trade&quot;. Dupont himself was educated at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford College and Clare College, Cambridge where he read law. He qualified as a solicitor in 1929 and set up his own firm in 1933.

Having served in the Royal Artillery Officer Training Corps while at university, on the outbreak of World War II he was commissioned into the Artillery and served as an adjutant for a light anti-aircraft battalion. He served in North Africa and was on General Eisenhower&#x27;s staff during the liberation of Europe in 1944; he ended the war as a War Office official.

==Move to Rhodesia==
In 1947 Dupont briefly visited Southern Rhodesia, returning in 1948. He bought land at Featherstone, south of Salisbury (now Harare), which he turned into a successful cattle ranch. He emigrated full time in the early 1950s – by which time the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland had come into being, including Southern Rhodesia as a territory – but was not initially involved in politics. Tragedy struck him several times later in the decade: in 1957 his second wife died, and in 1958 his son and daughter were both killed in an air crash.

==Politics==
He entered politics in 1958, winning on the Dominion Party ticket in the Fort Victoria (now Masvingo) federal constituency. Four years later, he became the member for Charter in the Southern Rhodesian parliament, this time standing for the Rhodesian Front (RF). At the same time, he was appointed Minister for Justice.

However, Dupont was not pleased with the performance of the Prime Minister, Winston Field, and after Field&#x27;s failure to win independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 following the dissolution of the Central African Federation, he and Desmond Lardner-Burke, known as &quot;the cowboys&quot;, joined forces to overthrow Field and install Ian Smith as prime minister.

In October 1964, Dupont thwarted Sir Roy Welensky&#x27;s attempt to re-enter politics in Rhodesia following the break-up of the Federation. Welensky had assumed the leadership of the opposition UFP (which he renamed the Rhodesia Party), and was contesting a by-election in Arundel, but Dupont deliberately resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose him. Dupont soundly defeated Welensky by 1079 votes to 633.

Forming a close relationship with the rising RF politician Ian Smith, Dupont assisted in the latter&#x27;s becoming prime minister in 1964 and was consequently promoted to become Smith&#x27;s deputy. As Deputy Prime Minister of Rhodesia, he held the portfolio of External Affairs, and added Defence in June 1965.

==UDI role==
From August 1964 Dupont was deputy prime minister of Rhodesia, and served as Smith&#x27;s minister of external affairs (adding also the Defence portfolio from June 1965). When Smith issued the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965, Dupont was the second signatory to the UDI document.

Smith&#x27;s government initially continued to profess loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II. Accordingly, it continued to recognise Elizabeth as head of state, with oaths of allegiance to &quot;Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth, Queen of Rhodesia, her heirs and successors&quot;. At the same time, Smith&#x27;s government ceased to recognise the authority of her &quot;de jure&quot; representative, the Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs. When Gibbs formally dismissed Smith and his entire cabinet on orders from Whitehall, Smith maintained that Gibbs&#x27; reserve power to sack the government no longer existed. Instead, on 17 November, it appointed Dupont to the post of &quot;Acting Officer Administering the Government&quot;.

Opponents of UDI who considered it an illegal move, such as the independent member of the Legislative Assembly Ahrn Palley, refused to recognise Dupont&#x27;s office, and walked out of the opening of Parliament when Dupont came to deliver the Speech from the Throne.

On 2 December 1965, Smith wrote a personal letter to the Queen asking her to accept Dupont as Governor-General of Rhodesia. In response, Buckingham Palace replied, &quot;Her Majesty is not able to entertain purported advice of this kind, and has therefore been pleased to direct that no action shall be taken upon it&quot;. Smith was attempting to assert his claimed prerogatives as Her Majesty&#x27;s Rhodesian prime minister. However, the UK, with the near-unanimous support of the international community, maintained that Gibbs was the Queen&#x27;s only legitimate representative in what it still considered to be the colony of Southern Rhodesia, and hence the only lawful authority in the area.

Under the 1965 Constitution, if the Queen did not appoint a governor-general within fourteen days of advice being tendered by the prime minister, a regent was to be appointed. In deference to the royal family, however, on 16 December, Smith amended his original plan and Dupont was appointed as officer administering the government. He would continue to use the title until the declaration of a republic in 1970.

In a referendum held on 24 June 1969, the predominantly white electorate approved a new constitution making Rhodesia a republic, with the president as ceremonial head of state. A bill to that effect was passed by the Legislative Assembly on 17 November, and was signed into law by Dupont on 27 November. Dupont&#x27;s last duty as officer administrating the government was to sign the proclamation of a republic on 2 March 1970.

==Presidency==
Following the declaration of a republic on 2 March 1970, Dupont was made interim president pending the elections under a new constitution on 10 April. When Rhodesia was formally declared a republic, Parliament elected Dupont as president on 14 April. During the latter period of his term he suffered long bouts of ill health, and retired on 31 December 1975.

==Personal life==
Clifford and Barbara Dupont married in London in 1933. They divorced in 1942 after having two children: Hilary and Graham. Graham died in childhood in England in 1942. In 1946, he married his second wife Betty Wood at Kensington Registry Office. Wood was fifteen years his junior. In 1947, they had a son, Stephen. Betty died in 1957 in Salisbury, and was buried in Warren Hills. His two children, Hilary and Stephen, were killed in 1958 when their Central African Airways plane crashed near Benghazi.

On 23 May 1963, he married Armenell Mary Betty Bennet (1929-2000), originally from Cornwall, who was a branch organiser for the Rhodesian Front. They had no children. Armenell died on 10 April 2000 in Harare.
On 28 June 1978, Dupont died while undergoing radium treatment for what was believed to be cancer.

<text>Max Nonne (13 January 1861, Hamburg – 12 August 1959, Hamburg) was a German neurologist.

== Biography ==
Max Nonne received his early education at the &quot;Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums&quot; in Hamburg, and later studied medicine at the universities of Heidelberg, Freiburg, and Berlin, obtaining his doctorate in 1884. After graduation, he served as an assistant in the Heidelberg medical clinic under Wilhelm Heinrich Erb (1840-1921) and in the surgical clinic in Kiel under Johannes Friedrich August von Esmarch (1823-1908), then in 1889 returned to Hamburg as a neurologist. During the same year, he became head physician in the department of internal medicine at the Red Cross Hospital. In 1896 he was appointed director of neurology at Eppendorf Hospital, Hamburg.

Nonne became a titular professor of neurology in 1913, and in 1919 began teaching classes in neurology at the newly founded University of Hamburg, where in 1925 he became &quot;professor ordinarius&quot;. Here he worked with Alfons Maria Jakob (1884-1931).

Nonne was one of the four physicians asked to investigate Vladimir Ilich Lenin during the Russian leaders&#x27; final disease.

<doc id="744988" wikidata="Q5374241" url="?curid=744988" title="Empirical Bayes method">
<text>Empirical Bayes methods are procedures for statistical inference in which the prior probability distribution is estimated from the data. This approach stands in contrast to standard Bayesian methods, for which the prior distribution is fixed before any data are observed. Despite this difference in perspective, empirical Bayes may be viewed as an approximation to a fully Bayesian treatment of a hierarchical model wherein the parameters at the highest level of the hierarchy are set to their most likely values, instead of being integrated out. Empirical Bayes, also known as maximum [[marginal likelihood]], represents a convenient approach for setting hyperparameters, but has been mostly supplanted by fully Bayesian hierarchical analyses since the 2000s with the increasing availability of well-performing computation techniques. It is still commonly used, however, for variational methods in Deep Learning, such as variational autoencoders, where latent variable spaces are high-dimensional.

==Introduction==

Empirical Bayes methods can be seen as an approximation to a fully Bayesian treatment of a hierarchical Bayes model.

In, for example, a two-stage hierarchical Bayes model, observed data formula_1 are assumed to be generated from an unobserved set of parameters formula_2 according to a probability distribution formula_3. In turn, the parameters formula_4 can be considered samples drawn from a population characterised by hyperparameters formula_5 according to a probability distribution formula_6. In the hierarchical Bayes model, though not in the empirical Bayes approximation, the hyperparameters formula_5 are considered to be drawn from an unparameterized distribution formula_8.

Information about a particular quantity of interest formula_9 therefore comes not only from the properties of those data formula_10 that directly depend on it, but also from the properties of the population of parameters formula_11 as a whole, inferred from the data as a whole, summarised by the hyperparameters formula_12.

Using Bayes&#x27; theorem,

:formula_13

In general, this integral will not be tractable analytically or symbolically and must be evaluated by numerical methods. Stochastic (random) or deterministic approximations may be used. Example stochastic methods are Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo sampling. Deterministic approximations are discussed in quadrature.

Alternatively, the expression can be written as
:formula_14
and the final factor in the integral can in turn be expressed as
:formula_15

These suggest an iterative scheme, qualitatively similar in structure to a Gibbs sampler, to evolve successively improved approximations to formula_16 and formula_17. First, calculate an initial approximation to formula_16 ignoring the formula_19 dependence completely; then calculate an approximation to formula_17 based upon the initial approximate distribution of formula_16; then use this formula_17 to update the approximation for formula_16; then update formula_17; and so on.

When the true distribution formula_17 is sharply peaked, the integral determining formula_16 may be not much changed by replacing the probability distribution over formula_12 with a point estimate formula_28 representing the distribution&#x27;s peak (or, alternatively, its mean),
:formula_29
With this approximation, the above iterative scheme becomes the EM algorithm.

The term &quot;Empirical Bayes&quot; can cover a wide variety of methods, but most can be regarded as an early truncation of either the above scheme or something quite like it. Point estimates, rather than the whole distribution, are typically used for the parameter(s) formula_12. The estimates for formula_28 are typically made from the first approximation to formula_16 without subsequent refinement. These estimates for formula_28 are usually made without considering an appropriate prior distribution for formula_19.

==Point estimation==
===Robbins&#x27; method: non-parametric empirical Bayes (NPEB)===

Robbins considered a case of sampling from a mixed distribution, where probability for each formula_35 (conditional on formula_36) is specified by a Poisson distribution,

:formula_37

where formula_38 denotes &quot;number of&quot;. (See also Good–Turing frequency estimation.)

;Example – Accident rates

Suppose each customer of an insurance company has an &quot;accident rate&quot; Θ and is insured against accidents; the probability distribution of Θ is the underlying distribution, and is unknown. The number of accidents suffered by each customer in a specified time period has a Poisson distribution with expected value equal to the particular customer&#x27;s accident rate. The actual number of accidents experienced by a customer is the observable quantity. A crude way to estimate the underlying probability distribution of the accident rate Θ is to estimate the proportion of members of the whole population suffering 0, 1, 2, 3, ... accidents during the specified time period as the corresponding proportion in the observed random sample. Having done so, it is then desired to predict the accident rate of each customer in the sample. As above, one may use the conditional expected value of the accident rate Θ given the observed number of accidents during the baseline period. Thus, if a customer suffers six accidents during the baseline period, that customer&#x27;s estimated accident rate is 7 × [the proportion of the sample who suffered 7 accidents] / [the proportion of the sample who suffered 6 accidents]. Note that if the proportion of people suffering &quot;k&quot; accidents is a decreasing function of &quot;k&quot;, the customer&#x27;s predicted accident rate will often be lower than their observed number of accidents.

This shrinkage effect is typical of empirical Bayes analyses.

=== Gaussian ===
Suppose formula_39 are random variables, such that formula_40 is observed, but formula_41 is hidden. The problem is to find the expectation of formula_41, conditional on formula_40. Suppose further that formula_44, that is, formula_45, where formula_46 is a multivariate gaussian with variance formula_47.

Then, we have the formula formula_48by direct calculation with the probability density function of multivariate gaussians. Integrating over formula_49, we obtainformula_50In particular, this means that one can perform Bayesian estimation of formula_41 without access to either the prior density of formula_41 or the posterior density of formula_40. The only requirement is to have access to the score function of formula_40. This has applications in score-based generative modeling.

===Parametric empirical Bayes===

If the likelihood and its prior take on simple parametric forms (such as 1- or 2-dimensional likelihood functions with simple conjugate priors), then the empirical Bayes problem is only to estimate the marginal formula_55 and the hyperparameters formula_19 using the complete set of empirical measurements. For example, one common approach, called parametric empirical Bayes point estimation, is to approximate the marginal using the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), or a moments expansion, which allows one to express the hyperparameters formula_19 in terms of the empirical mean and variance. This simplified marginal allows one to plug in the empirical averages into a point estimate for the prior formula_4. The resulting equation for the prior formula_4 is greatly simplified, as shown below.

There are several common parametric empirical Bayes models, including the Poisson–gamma model (below), the Beta-binomial model, the Gaussian–Gaussian model, the Dirichlet-multinomial model, as well specific models for Bayesian linear regression (see below) and Bayesian multivariate linear regression. More advanced approaches include hierarchical Bayes models and Bayesian mixture models.

====Gaussian–Gaussian model====

For an example of empirical Bayes estimation using a Gaussian-Gaussian model, see Empirical Bayes estimators.

====Poisson–gamma model====

For example, in the example above, let the likelihood be a Poisson distribution, and let the prior now be specified by the conjugate prior, which is a gamma distribution (formula_60) (where formula_61):

:formula_62

It is straightforward to show the posterior is also a gamma distribution. Write

:formula_63

where the marginal distribution has been omitted since it does not depend explicitly on formula_4.
Expanding terms which do depend on formula_4 gives the posterior as:

:formula_66

So the posterior density is also a gamma distribution formula_67, where formula_68, and formula_69. Also notice that the marginal is simply the integral of the posterior over all formula_70, which turns out to be a negative binomial distribution.

To apply empirical Bayes, we will approximate the marginal using the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). But since the posterior is a gamma distribution, the MLE of the marginal turns out to be just the mean of the posterior, which is the point estimate formula_71 we need. Recalling that the mean formula_72 of a gamma distribution formula_73 is simply formula_74, we have

:formula_75

To obtain the values of formula_76 and formula_77, empirical Bayes prescribes estimating mean formula_78 and variance formula_79 using the complete set of empirical data.

The resulting point estimate formula_80 is therefore like a weighted average of the sample mean formula_81 and the prior mean formula_82. This turns out to be a general feature of empirical Bayes; the point estimates for the prior (i.e. mean) will look like a weighted averages of the sample estimate and the prior estimate (likewise for estimates of the variance).

<doc id="744994" wikidata="Q1412901" url="?curid=744994" title="Non-aggression pact">
<text>A non-aggression pact or neutrality pact is a treaty between two or more states/countries that includes a promise by the signatories not to engage in military action against each other. Such treaties may be described by other names, such as a treaty of friendship or non-belligerency, etc. Leeds, Ritter, Mitchell, &amp; Long (2002) distinguish between a non-aggression pact and a neutrality pact. They posit that a &quot;non-aggression pact&quot; includes the promise not to attack the other pact signatories, whereas a &quot;neutrality pact&quot; includes a promise to avoid support of any entity that acts against the interests of any of the pact signatories. The most readily recognized example of the aforementioned entity is another country, nation-state, or sovereign organization that represents a negative consequence towards the advantages held by one or more of the signatory parties.

== History ==
In the 19th century neutrality pacts have historically been used to give permission for one signatory of the pact to attack or attempt to negatively influence an entity not protected by the neutrality pact. The participants of the neutrality pact agree not to attempt to counteract an act of aggression waged by a pact signatory towards an entity not protected under the terms of the pact. Possible motivations for such acts by one or more of the pacts&#x27; signatories include a desire to take, or expand, control of economic resources, militarily important locations, etc.

The 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany is perhaps the best-known example of a non-aggression pact. The Pact lasted until the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. However, such pacts may be a device for neutralising a potential military threat, enabling at least one of the signatories to free up its military resources for other purposes. For example, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact freed German resources from the Russian front. On the other hand, the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, signed on April 13, 1941, removed the threat from Japan in the east enabling the Soviets to move large forces from Siberia to the fight against the Germans, which had a direct bearing on the Battle of Moscow.

The Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) dataset records 185 agreements that are solely non-aggression pacts between 1815 and 2018. According to this data, 29 such pacts were recorded in the interwar period with spikes in occurrences in 1960, 1970, 1979, and especially the early 1990s where a number of Eastern European states signed pacts following the fall of the Soviet Union.

States with a history of rivalry tend to sign non-aggression pacts in order to prevent future conflict with one another. The pacts often facilitate information exchange which reduce uncertainty that might lead to conflict. Additionally, the pact signals to third party nations that the rivalry has reduced and that peaceful relations is desired. It has been found that major powers are more likely to start military conflicts against their partners in non-aggression pacts than against states that do not have any sort of alliance with them.

== Other usage ==
The term has colloquial usage outside the field of international relations. In the context of association football, the term can imply a deliberate lack of aggression between two teams, such as at the Disgrace of Gijón, which, in Germany, is known as the &quot;Nichtangriffspakt von Gijón&quot; (lit. &quot;Non-aggression pact of Gijón&quot;). A non-aggression pact can also be a formal agreement or gentlemen&#x27;s agreement limiting transfers for players between two or more clubs.

<text>Within ghost hunting and parapsychology, electronic voice phenomena (EVP) are sounds found on electronic recordings that are interpreted as spirit voices. Parapsychologist Konstantīns Raudive, who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase.

Enthusiasts consider EVP to be a form of paranormal phenomenon often found in recordings with static or other background noise. Scientists regard EVP as a form of auditory pareidolia (interpreting random sounds as voices in one&#x27;s own language) and a pseudoscience promulgated by popular culture. Prosaic explanations for EVP include apophenia (perceiving patterns in random information), equipment artifacts, and hoaxes.

==History==
As the Spiritualist religious movement became prominent in the 1840s–1940s with a distinguishing belief that the spirits of the dead can be contacted by mediums, new technologies of the era, including photography, were employed by spiritualists in an effort to demonstrate contact with a spirit world. So popular were such ideas that Thomas Edison was asked in an interview with &quot;Scientific American&quot; to comment on the possibility of using his inventions to communicate with spirits. He replied that if the spirits were only capable of subtle influences, a sensitive recording device would provide a better chance of spirit communication than the table tipping and ouija boards mediums employed at the time. However, there is no indication that Edison ever designed or constructed a device for such a purpose. As sound recording became widespread, mediums explored using this technology to demonstrate communication with the dead as well. Spiritualism declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but attempts to use portable recording devices and modern digital technologies to communicate with spirits continued.

===Early interest===
American photographer Attila von Szalay was among the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1956 – after switching to a reel-to-reel tape recorder – that he believed he was successful. Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted several recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when there was no one in the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as &quot;This is G!&quot;, &quot;Hot dog, Art!&quot;, and &quot;Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all&quot;. Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless&#x27;s work was published by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1959. Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, &quot;Phone Calls From the Dead&quot;.

In 1959, Swedish painter and film producer Friedrich Jürgenson was recording bird songs. Upon playing the tape later, he heard what he interpreted to be his dead father&#x27;s voice and then the spirit of his deceased wife calling his name. He went on to make several more recordings, including one that he said contained a message from his late mother.

===Raudive voices===
Konstantin Raudive, a Latvian psychologist who had taught at Uppsala University, Sweden, and who had worked in conjunction with Jürgenson, made over 100,000 recordings which he described as being communications with people. Some of these recordings were conducted in an RF-screened laboratory and contained words Raudive said were identifiable. In an attempt to confirm the content of his collection of recordings, Raudive invited listeners to hear and interpret them. He believed that the clarity of the voices heard in his recordings implied that they could not be readily explained by normal means. Raudive published his first book, &quot;Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead&quot; in 1968 and it was translated into English in 1971.

===Spiricom and Frank&#x27;s Box===
In 1980, William O&#x27;Neil constructed an electronic audio device called &quot;The Spiricom&quot;. O&#x27;Neil claimed the device was built to specifications which he received psychically from George Mueller, a scientist who had died six years previously. At a Washington, DC press conference on April 6, 1982, O&#x27;Neil stated that he was able to hold two-way conversations with spirits through the Spiricom device, and provided the design specifications to researchers for free. However, nobody is known to have replicated the results O&#x27;Neil claimed using his own Spiricom devices. O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s partner, retired industrialist George Meek, attributed O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s success, and the inability of others to replicate it, to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s mediumistic abilities forming part of the loop that made the system work.
In 2020 Kenny Biddle wrote a comprehensive article explaining the origins of the Spiricom as developed by O&#x27;Neil and Meek. He was prompted to do so by the re-emergence of the device on the television series &quot;Ghosthunters&quot;. He comprehensively debunked the &quot;science&quot; behind the device in both the original development and the &quot;Ghosthunters&quot; episode.

Another electronic device specifically constructed in an attempt to capture EVP is &quot;Frank&#x27;s Box&quot; or the &quot;Ghost Box&quot;, created in 2002 by EVP enthusiast Frank Sumption for supposed real-time communication with the dead. Sumption claims he received his design instructions from the spirit world. The device is described as a combination white noise generator and AM radio receiver modified to sweep back and forth through the AM band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of pareidolia. Paranormal researcher Ben Radford writes that Frank&#x27;s Box is a &quot;modern version of the Ouija board... also known as the &#x27;broken radio&#x27;&quot;.

===Interest in the 21st century and late 20th century===
In 1982, Sarah Estep founded the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP) in Severna Park, Maryland, a nonprofit organization with the purpose of increasing awareness of EVP, and of teaching standardized methods for capturing it. Estep began her exploration of EVP in 1976, and says she has made hundreds of recordings of messages from deceased friends, relatives, and extraterrestrials whom she speculated originated from other planets or dimensions.

The term Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC) was coined by Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s to refer more generally to communication through any sort of electronic device such as tape recorders, fax machines, television sets or computers between spirits or other discarnate entities and the living. One particularly famous claimed incidence of ITC occurred when the image of EVP enthusiast Friedrich Jürgenson (whose funeral was held that day) was said to have appeared on a television in the home of a colleague, which had been purposefully tuned to a vacant channel. ITC enthusiasts also look at the TV and video camera feedback loop of the Droste effect.

In 1979, parapsychologist D. Scott Rogo described an alleged paranormal phenomenon in which people report that they receive simple, brief, and usually single-occurrence telephone calls from spirits of deceased relatives, friends, or strangers. Rosemary Guiley has written &quot;within the parapsychology establishment, Rogo was often faulted for poor scholarship, which, critics said, led to erroneous conclusions.&quot;

In 1995, the parapsychologist David Fontana proposed in an article that poltergeists could haunt tape recorders. He speculated that this may have happened to the parapsychologist Maurice Grosse who investigated the Enfield Poltergeist case. However, Tom Flynn, a media expert for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, examined Fontana&#x27;s article and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation for the phenomena. According to the skeptical investigator Joe Nickell &quot;Occasionally, especially with older tape and under humid conditions, as the tape travels it can adhere to one of the guide posts. When this happens on a deck where both supply and take-up spindles are powered, the tape continues to feed, creating a fold. It was such a loop of tape, Flynn theorizes, that threaded its way amid the works of Grosse&#x27;s recorder.&quot;

In 1997, Imants Barušs, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, conducted a series of experiments using the methods of EVP investigator Konstantin Raudive, and the work of &quot;instrumental transcommunication researcher&quot; Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP. Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: &quot;While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense.&quot; The findings were published in the &quot;Journal of Scientific Exploration&quot; in 2001, and include a literature review.

In 2005, the &quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot; published a report by paranormal investigator Alexander MacRae. MacRae conducted recording sessions using a device of his own design that generated EVP.
In an attempt to demonstrate that different individuals would interpret EVP in the recordings the same way, MacRae asked seven people to compare some selections to a list of five phrases he provided, and to choose the best match. MacRae said the results of the listening panels indicated that the selections were of paranormal origin.

Portable digital voice recorders are currently the technology of choice for some EVP investigators. Since some of these devices are very susceptible to Radio Frequency (RF) contamination, EVP enthusiasts sometimes try to record EVP in RF- and sound-screened rooms.

Some EVP enthusiasts describe hearing the words in EVP as an ability, much like learning a new language. Skeptics suggest that the claimed instances may be misinterpretations of natural phenomena, inadvertent influence of the electronic equipment by researchers, or deliberate influencing of the researchers and the equipment by third parties. EVP and ITC are seldom researched within the scientific community, so most research in the field is carried out by amateur researchers who lack training and resources to conduct scientific research, and who are motivated by subjective notions.

==Explanations and origins==
Paranormal claims for the origin of EVP include living humans imprinting thoughts directly on an electronic medium through psychokinesis and communication by discarnate entities such as spirits, nature energies, beings from other dimensions, or extraterrestrials. Paranormal explanations for EVP generally assume production of EVP by a communicating intelligence through means other than the typical functioning of communication technologies. Natural explanations for reported instances of EVP tend to dispute this assumption explicitly and provide explanations which do not require novel mechanisms that are not based on recognized scientific phenomena.

One study, by psychologist Imants Barušs, was unable to replicate suggested paranormal origins for EVP recorded under controlled conditions. Brian Regal in &quot;Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia&quot; (2009) has written &quot;A case can be made for the idea that many EVPs are artifacts of the recording process itself with which the operators are unfamiliar. The majority of EVPs have alternative, nonspiritual sources; anomalous ones have no clear proof they are of spiritual origin.&quot;

===Natural explanations===

There are a number of simple scientific explanations that can account for why some listeners to the static on audio devices may believe they hear voices, including radio interference and the tendency of the human brain to recognize patterns in random stimuli. Some recordings may be hoaxes created by frauds or pranksters.

====Psychology and perception====

&quot;Auditory pareidolia&quot; is a situation created when the brain incorrectly interprets random patterns as being familiar patterns. In the case of EVP it could result in an observer interpreting random noise on an audio recording as being the familiar sound of a human voice. The propensity for an apparent voice heard in white noise recordings to be in a language understood well by those researching it, rather than in an unfamiliar language, has been cited as evidence of this, and a broad class of phenomena referred to by author Joe Banks as &quot;Rorschach Audio&quot; has been described as a global explanation for all manifestations of EVP.

In a 2019 investigation of a supposed haunted painting in a West Virginia museum, paranormal researcher Kenny Biddle investigated the claims made by the museum owner and ghost hunters that an EVP recording clearly saying the woman&#x27;s name, &quot;Annie&quot;, is really the voice of the woman in the portrait. The name Annie is written on the back of the portrait, which primes anyone listening for the name, to know what name to listen for. The EVP was created using a Radio Shack radio &quot;modified to allow it to continually scan through the available AM or FM frequencies without muting the sound.&quot; Regarding a general question by the ghost hunter &quot;What is your name?&quot;, Biddle writes, &quot;I can guarantee sooner or later you&#x27;ll hear something that sounds like a name, and there is a good chance of being a name, because you&#x27;re listening to radio broadcasts, news reports, commercials, and so on—which often include names.&quot; Biddle lists words such as &quot;company, anything, anyone, mahogany, many, or even any&quot; as words that can be commonly heard while listening to the radio. The phrase &#x27;&quot;...and he...&quot;&#x27; would also sound like &quot;Annie&quot; to anyone primed to listen for the name Annie.

Skeptics such as David Federlein, Chris French, Terence Hines and Michael Shermer say that EVP are usually recorded by raising the &quot;noise floor&quot;⁠the electrical noise created by all electrical in order to create white noise. When this noise is filtered, it can be made to produce noises which sound like speech. Federlein says that this is no different from using a wah pedal on a guitar, which is a focused sweep filter which moves around the spectrum and creates open vowel sounds. This, according to Federlein, sounds exactly like some EVP. This, in combination with such things as cross modulation of radio stations or faulty ground loops can cause the impression of paranormal voices. The human brain evolved to recognize patterns, and if a person listens to enough noise the brain will detect words, even when there is no intelligent source for them. Expectation also plays an important part in making people believe they are hearing voices in random noise.

&quot;Apophenia&quot; is related to, but distinct from pareidolia. Apophenia is defined as &quot;the spontaneous finding of connections or meaning in things which are random, unconnected or meaningless&quot;, and has been put forward as a possible explanation. According to the psychologist James Alcock what people hear in EVP recordings can best be explained by apophenia, cross-modulation or expectation and wishful thinking. Alcock concluded &quot;Electronic Voice Phenomena are the products of hope and expectation; the claims wither away under the light of scientific scrutiny.&quot;

====Physics====

Interference, for example, is seen in EVP recordings, especially those recorded on devices which contain RLC circuitry. These cases represent radio signals of voices or other sounds from broadcast sources. Interference from CB Radio transmissions and wireless baby monitors, or anomalies generated through cross modulation from other electronic devices, are all documented phenomena. It is even possible for circuits to resonate without any internal power source by means of radio reception.

&quot;Capture errors&quot; are anomalies created by the method used to capture audio signals, such as noise generated through the over-amplification of a signal at the point of recording.

Artifacts created during attempts to boost the clarity of an existing recording might explain some EVP. Methods include re-sampling, frequency isolation, and noise reduction or enhancement, which can cause recordings to take on qualities significantly different from those that were present in the original recording.

The first EVP recordings may have originated from the use of tape recording equipment with poorly aligned erasure and recording heads, resulting in the incomplete erasure of previous audio recordings on the tape. This could allow a small percentage of previous content to be superimposed or mixed into a new &#x27;silent&#x27; recording.

====Sporadic meteors and meteor showers====

For all radio transmissions above 30 MHz (which are not reflected by the ionosphere) there is a possibility of meteor reflection of the radio signal. Meteors leave a trail of ionised particles and electrons as they pass through the upper atmosphere (a process called ablation) which reflect transmission radio waves which would usually flow into space. These reflected waves are from transmitters which are below the horizon of the received meteor reflection. In Europe this means the brief scattered wave may carry a foreign voice which can interfere with radio receivers. Meteor reflected radio waves last between 0.05 seconds and 1 second, depending on the size of the meteor.

==Organizations that show interest in EVP==
There are a number of organizations dedicated to studying EVP and instrumental transcommunication, or which otherwise express interest in the subject. Individuals within these organizations may participate in investigations, author books or journal articles, deliver presentations, and hold conferences where they share experiences. In addition, organizations exist which dispute the validity of the phenomena on scientific grounds.

The Association TransCommunication (ATransC), formerly the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP), and the International Ghost Hunters Society conduct ongoing investigations of EVP and ITC including collecting examples of purported EVP available over the internet. The Rorschach Audio Project, initiated by sound artist Joe Banks, which presents EVP as a product of radio interference combined with auditory pareidolia and the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Biopsychocybernetics Research, a non-profit organization dedicated to studying anomalous phenomena related to neurophysiological conditions. According to the AA-EVP it is &quot;the only organized group of researchers we know of specializing in the study of ITC&quot;.

Parapsychologists and spiritualists have an ongoing interest in EVP. Many spiritualists experiment with a variety of techniques for spirit communication which they believe provide evidence of the continuation of life. According to the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, &quot;An important modern day development in mediumship is spirit communications via an electronic device. This is most commonly known as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP)&quot;. An informal survey by the organization&#x27;s Department Of Phenomenal Evidence cites that 1/3 of churches conduct sessions in which participants seek to communicate with spirit entities using EVP.

The James Randi Educational Foundation offered a million dollars for proof that any phenomena, including EVP, are caused paranormally.

== Demographics ==
=== United States ===
In 2015, an investigation by associate professor of Sociology Marc Eaton on the demography of United States paranormal groups that used electronic voice phenomenon found an overrepresentation of white participants, raised in the Roman Catholic Church (which is only 21% of the U.S. population), mainly with some post-secondary education. Although a preponderance of research shows that women and &quot;less socially integrated individuals&quot; are more likely to believe in ghosts, the demographic samples in Eaton&#x27;s research did not reflect this.

==Cultural impact==
The concept of EVP has influenced popular culture. It is popular as an entertaining pursuit, as in ghost hunting, and as a means of dealing with grief. It has influenced literature, radio, film, television, and music.

=== Groups ===
Investigation of EVP is the subject of hundreds of regional and national groups and Internet message boards. Paranormal investigator John Zaffis claims, &quot;There&#x27;s been a boom in ghost hunting ever since the Internet took off.&quot; Investigators, equipped with electronic gear – like EMF meters, video cameras, and audio recorders – scour reportedly haunted venues, trying to uncover visual and audio evidence of ghosts. Many use portable recording devices in an attempt to capture EVP.

=== Films ===
Films involving EVP include &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, and &quot;White Noise&quot;.

=== Video games ===
&quot;Sylvio&quot; is an indie-developed first-person horror adventure video game released on Steam in June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and, OS X, utilizing the Unity engine. The game is about an audio recordist called Juliette Waters, who records the voices of ghosts through electronic voice phenomenon. She finds herself trapped in an old family park, shut down since a landslide in 1971, and she now needs to use her recorder to survive the night. A sequel, &quot;Sylvio 2&quot;, was released on October 11, 2017.

&quot;Phasmophobia&quot; is a co-op horror video game, in which a team of one to four players play as ghost hunters who try to identify hostile ghosts in varying locations. The game features a Spirit Box item used to capture EVPs of certain ghost types, which helps the players identify the type of the ghost they&#x27;re dealing with. EVPs in &quot;Phasmophobia&quot; consist of singular words, such as &quot;here&quot;, &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;death&quot;, &quot;adult&quot;, etc., each denoting a response to a player initiated question.

=== TV and radio ===
It has been featured on television series like &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, &quot;In Search Of… (1981)&quot;, &quot;The Omega Factor&quot;, &quot;A Haunting&quot;, &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;, &quot;MonsterQuest&quot;, &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;, &quot;The Secret Saturdays&quot;, &quot;Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Derren Brown Investigates&quot;, &quot;Ghost Lab and Buzzfeed Unsolved: Supernatural&quot;

*&quot;Coast To Coast AM&quot; hosts George Noory and Art Bell have explored the topic of EVP with featured guests such as Brendan Cook and Barbara McBeath of the Ghost Investigators Society, and paranormal investigator and &#x27;demonologist&#x27; Lou Gentile. 
*&quot;The Spirit of John Lennon&quot; was a pay-per-view séance broadcast in 2006, in which TV crew members, a psychic, and an &quot;expert in paranormal activity&quot; claim the spirit of former Beatle John Lennon made contact with them through what was described as &quot;an Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP).&quot;
*The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Dark Water&quot; features a fictional facility which was allegedly based on this principle.
* The Egyptian series &quot;Nasiby w Kesmetk&quot; episode 6

=== Novels ===
&quot;Legion&quot;, a 1983 novel by William Peter Blatty, contains a subplot where Dr. Vincent Amfortas, a terminally ill neurologist, leaves a &quot;to-be-opened-upon-my-death&quot; letter for Father Dyer detailing his accounts of contact with the dead, including the doctor&#x27;s recently deceased wife, Ann, through EVP recordings. Amfortas&#x27; character and the EVP subplot do not appear in the film version of the novel, &quot;The Exorcist III&quot;, although in Kinderman&#x27;s dream dead people are seen trying to communicate with the living by radio.

In &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;, a 2003 novel by William Gibson, the main character&#x27;s mother tries to convince her that her father is communicating with her from recordings after his death/disappearance in the September 11, 2001 attacks.

=== Theatre and music ===
In &quot;Nyctivoe&quot;, a 2001 vampire-inspired play by Dimitris Lyacos, the male character as well as his deceased companion are speaking from a recording device amidst a static/white noise background.

In &quot;With the people from the bridge&quot;, a 2014 play by Dimitris Lyacos based on the idea of the return of the dead, the voice of the female character NCTV is transmitted from a television monitor amidst a static/white noise background.

EVP is the subject of Vyktoria Pratt Keating&#x27;s song &quot;Disembodied Voices on Tape&quot; from her 2003 album &quot;Things that Fall from the Sky&quot;, produced by Andrew Giddings of Jethro Tull.

Laurie Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Example #22&quot;, from her 1981 album &quot;Big Science,&quot; interposes spoken sentences and phrases in German with sung passages in English representing EVP.

During the outro to &quot;Rubber Ring&quot; by The Smiths, a sample from an EVP recording is repeated. The phrase &quot;You are sleeping, you do not want to believe,&quot; is a &#x27;translation&#x27; of the &#x27;spirit voices&#x27; from a 1970s flexitape. The original recording is from the 1971 record which accompanied Raudive&#x27;s book &#x27;Breakthrough&#x27;, and which was re-issued as a flexi-disc in the 1980s free with The Unexplained magazine.

Bass Communion&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Ghosts on Magnetic Tape&quot; was inspired by EVP.

The band Giles Corey, founded by Dan Barrett composed a song called &quot;Empty Churches&quot; which features track 2 called &#x27;Raymond Cass&#x27;, track 36 called &#x27;Justified Theft&#x27; and track 38 called &#x27;Tramping&#x27; from the album &quot;An Introduction to EVP&quot; by The Ghost Orchid which features excerpts from different EVP experiments produced by many researchers, although most are unknown, some have been pointed out to be more known researchers who studied EVP recordings including Friedrich Jurgenson, Raymond Cass and Konstantin Raudive.

The 2017 album &quot;Katharsis (A Small Victory)&quot; of Polish theatre group Teatr Tworzenia by Jarosław Pijarowski contains EVP recordings in the background of its second track &quot;Katharsis – Pandemonium&quot;.

<text>Hardwick and Hardwicke are common place names in England—this is from the Old English pre-7th century word &quot;heorde&quot;, meaning a &quot;herd or flock&quot;, with &quot;wic&quot;, which like the later Viking word &quot;thorp&quot; described an outlying farm or settlement, which was dependent on a larger village. In some cases, &quot;Hardwick&quot; and &quot;Hardwicke&quot; are interchangeable and the spelling has evolved over time.
