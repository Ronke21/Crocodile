<text>Tesla is an American rock band from Sacramento, California. In late 1981, bassist Brian Wheat and guitarist Frank Hannon formed a band named City Kidd, which evolved into Tesla. By 1984, vocalist Jeff Keith, guitarist Tommy Skeoch, and drummer Troy Luccketta had joined the band, forming their classic lineup that appeared on all of the albums and live shows during their initial run. The band adopted the Tesla moniker shortly before recording their first album, as another band with a name similar to City Kidd already existed.

Tesla rose to fame during the hair metal boom of the 1980s. Their debut album, &quot;Mechanical Resonance&quot;, was released in 1986, which produced two hit singles, &quot;Modern Day Cowboy&quot; and their cover of &quot;Little Suzi&quot; (originally by Ph.D.). The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Great Radio Controversy&quot; (1989), peaked at 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and produced the top-ten single &quot;Love Song&quot;. The band recorded and released their third album, the live acoustic album &quot;Five Man Acoustical Jam&quot;, in 1990. It peaked at No.12 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and produced their top-charting single (No.8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), &quot;Signs&quot;, a cover of a song by the Five Man Electrical Band. Their third studio album, &quot;Psychotic Supper&quot; (1991), peaked at No.13, but lacked a hit single; similarly their next album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Bust a Nut&quot; did well enough on the album charts, peaking at No.20, but also lacked any radio hits. 

The band broke up in 1996, but returned in 2000 with a live tour and album, both named &quot;Replugged&quot;. They have continued to record and tour, though Skeoch left in 2006 and was replaced by Dave Rude on guitars. Their most recent release is the EP &quot;All About Love&quot; (2024), while their latest studio album to date is &quot;Shock&quot; (2019). Tesla have sold at least 14 million albums in the United States.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Mechanical Resonance&quot; (1981–1988)===
The band City Kidd was renamed Tesla during the recording of their first album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Mechanical Resonance&quot;, on the advice of their manager that City Kidd was not a great name (in addition, there was already another band going by that name). The band derived their name, certain album and song titles, and some song content from events relating to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Along with the band&#x27;s next two studio albums, &quot;Mechanical Resonance&quot; was produced by Michael Barbiero and Steve Thompson.

The band&#x27;s original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jeff Keith, guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, bassist Brian Wheat, and drummer Robert Contreras, who was soon replaced by ex-Eric Martin Band drummer Troy Luccketta.

In the early days of their career, Tesla toured with David Lee Roth, Alice Cooper, Def Leppard, and Poison, which resulted in the band being categorized as a glam metal band. The band&#x27;s members resented this labeling. The band, according to Troy Luccketta, now does not mind being labeled as a part of that scene.

===&quot;The Great Radio Controversy&quot; and &quot;Psychotic Supper&quot; (1989–1993)===
The band released their second album, &quot;The Great Radio Controversy&quot;, in 1989. The album helped solidify the band&#x27;s growing reputation and fan base, and produced five hit singles, including the power ballad &quot;Love Song&quot;.

In 1990, Tesla released &quot;Five Man Acoustical Jam&quot;, a live album featuring acoustic renditions of hits such as &quot;Comin&#x27; Atcha Live&quot;, &quot;Gettin&#x27; Better&quot;, &quot;Modern Day Cowboy&quot;, and &quot;Love Song&quot;. The album also featured a number of covers most notably a version of &quot;Signs&quot;, a 1971 hit by the Five Man Electrical Band.

In 1991, the band released their third studio album &quot;Psychotic Supper&quot;. The band itself considers this to be their best album according to their official web site. The 1998 Japanese reissue import of &quot;Psychotic Supper&quot; contains one previously unreleased song, &quot;Rock the Nation&quot;, as well as the songs &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Superstitious&quot;, and &quot;Run Run Run&quot;, both of which had only been previously available as B-sides to two singles from &quot;The Great Radio Controversy&quot;.

===&quot;Bust a Nut&quot; and hiatus (1994–1996)===
In 1994, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Bust a Nut&quot;. The Japanese edition of &quot;Bust a Nut&quot; contained the previously unreleased cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;The Ocean&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Bust a Nut&quot;, Skeoch departed because of his struggle with substance abuse. He rejoined after completing rehab, only to depart again months later. The band moved forward as a four-piece for a short while. However, it wasn&#x27;t long before Skeoch briefly joined up with solo artist Marshall Coleman&#x27;s band to support his solo career, only to see a departure of Marshall soon after. This band eventually morphed to include Jeff Keith and resurfaced as Bar 7 with a single &quot;Four Leaf Clover&quot;, from the album &quot;The World Is a Freak&quot;. Brian Wheat formed Soulmotor and Frank Hannon formed Moon Dog Mane, while Troy Luccketta worked with several local artists including the Bay Area&#x27;s One Thin Dime.

===Reunion, &quot;Into the Now&quot; and &quot;Real to Reel&quot; (2000–2007)===
After a break of six years, the Sacramento Bee reported that the band had reformed in 2000 with the help of local radio personality Pat Martin of KRXQ. The band played an emotional sold-out show at ARCO Arena in Sacramento on October 25, 2000. Soon after they recorded the double live album &quot;Replugged Live&quot;. In 2002 they were featured in the Rock Never Stops Tour alongside other 1980s rock bands.

2002 saw the release of a further live album, &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;, which is just a single CD version of &quot;Replugged Live&quot;.

In 2004, they released their fifth studio album &quot;Into the Now&quot; which debuted on the Billboard album chart at No.30. The album was well received by fans and the band was featured on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;

In the summer of 2006, the band embarked on the Electric Summer Jam Tour without guitarist Tommy Skeoch. Skeoch had left the band indefinitely to spend time with his family, and, as he later revealed on &quot;The Classic Metal Show&quot;, other reasons; particularly his continuing problems with substance abuse.
Scott Johnson of the Sacramento band Rogue filled in for a time on this tour. Eventually Dave Rude replaced Skeoch permanently.

Tesla recorded a two-volume collection of cover songs titled &quot;Real to Reel&quot;, which was released on June 5, 2007. The recording is available as a two-CD set. The first CD (containing 13 songs) is sold in a case with a blank slot for the second CD. The second CD (containing 12 additional songs) was initially available to concert goers in the US at no additional charge beyond the cost of a ticket. The second CD was also given away with the August edition of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine in Europe.

At the end of August, Tesla announced their first world tour in 16 years with dates in Australia, Japan, and Europe in October and November 2007.

===&quot;Forever More&quot; and &quot;Twisted Wires&quot; (2008–2012)===

In June and July 2008, Tesla played a few shows in Europe and the US, including Sweden Rock Festival, Graspop Metal Meeting and Rocklahoma. On July 15, 2008, &quot;Tesla- Comin&#x27; Atcha Live! 2008&quot; was released from a live concert filmed February 22, 2008 at the sold out Myth Nightclub in Maplewood, Minnesota. The two-hour show included hits &quot;Modern Day Cowboy&quot;, &quot;Love Song&quot; and &quot;Song and Emotion&quot; along with additional backstage footage.

On August 11, 2008, it was reported that Tesla&#x27;s next album, entitled &quot;Forever More&quot;, would be released on October 7 on their own record label, Tesla Electric Company Recordings. The album was produced by Terry Thomas, who produced &quot;Bust a Nut&quot;. The band aired the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;I Wanna Live&quot; on radio stations across the globe on August 18 and kicked off a world tour on October 1. Forever More debuted No. 33 on The Billboard 200 chart and spawned singles &quot;I Wanna Live&quot;, &quot;Fallin&#x27; Apart&quot; and &quot;Breakin&#x27; Free&quot;.

On May 10, 2011, the band played at a rally for the Sacramento Kings of the NBA. Tesla performed two songs, &quot;Signs&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot; during the Kings #HereWeRally at Cesar Chavez Park in Sacramento, California to celebrate the team staying in Sacramento for at least one more year.

On July 12, 2011, they released a mostly acoustic album titled &quot;Twisted Wires and the Acoustic Sessions&quot;.

===&quot;Simplicity&quot; and &quot;Shock&quot; (2013–present)===
In June 2013, Tesla released a new single &quot;Taste My Pain&quot; on iTunes. They released their eighth studio album &quot;Simplicity&quot; on June 6, 2014.

In 2015, the band toured with Def Leppard and Styx.

On August 26, 2016, Tesla released &quot;Mechanical Resonance Live&quot; in celebration of the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. It features live versions of every song from the original album and includes the new single &quot;Save That Goodness&quot;, written and produced by Phil Collen of Def Leppard.

In April 2017, Tesla began working on their ninth studio album, &quot;Shock&quot;, which was produced by Collen, and released on March 8, 2019.

Tesla released the one-off single &quot;Cold Blue Steel&quot; in August 2021, followed a year later by &quot;Time to Rock!&quot;.

Tesla released the six-track EP, &quot;All About Love&quot;, on November 29, 2024. It includes four versions of &quot;All About Love&quot;, a new instrumental track, &quot;From the Heart&quot;, as well as a live version of &quot;Walk Away&quot;.

==Charity work==
While promoting their album &quot;The Great Radio Controversy&quot;, the band participated in a canned food drive that allowed free concert admission to contributors, this event was incorporated into the video for &quot;The Way It Is&quot;.
In February 2005, Tesla headlined a benefit show at the PPAC in Providence, Rhode Island, for the victims of the Station nightclub fire. During the show the band auctioned off an autographed acoustic guitar, with the proceeds going to the Station Family Fund. 100% of the ticket sales also went to this charity.

In February 2008, Tesla helped fund and headlined a benefit concert for victims of the Station nightclub fire. The show was broadcast by VH1 Classic. Tesla played three songs: &quot;What You Give&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot;, and &quot;Love Song&quot;, though &quot;What You Give&quot; did not make it onto the broadcast.

==Musical style and influences==
Most of Tesla&#x27;s albums feature a bluesy hard rock style. Brian Wheat stated to have been influenced by classic 1960s and 1970s rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Queen, Bad Company and the Beatles. Tesla&#x27;s first two albums are often classified as glam metal, though AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey opined that the band&#x27;s blues and 1970s hard rock influences set them apart from their contemporaries. &quot;Loudwire&quot; described Tesla as a &quot;thinking man&#x27;s hair metal band&quot;, and VH1 ranked them at No. 22 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of Hair Metal.

In 2003, in his capacity as Commander, United States Joint Forces Command, Giambastiani published a &quot;lessons learned&quot; report. While generally praising U.S. performance it highlighted numerous incidents of friendly fire.

===Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===
On August 12, 2005, Giambastiani was sworn in as the seventh Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, becoming the third naval officer to hold that position.

As Vice Chairman, Giambastiani chaired the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, co-chaired the Defense Acquisition Board, and served as a member of the National Security Council Deputies Committee, the Nuclear Weapons Council and the Missile Defense Executive Board. In addition, he worked with the Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England as Co-Chair of the Deputies Advisory Working Group, which oversees implementation of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and other high level Departmental business issues.

On May 4–6, 2007, Giambastiani visited Tunisia, meeting with high-ranking military and civilian officials, including his Tunisian counterparts and Tunisian Foreign Minister Abdelwaheb Abdallah and Defense Minister Kamel Morjane. He went to the North Africa American Cemetery and Memorial on the outskirts of Tunis to pay his respects to fallen U.S. soldiers who had died there during the Tunisia campaign of World War II.

On June 1, 2007, Giambastiani announced his retirement from the military to spend more time with his family and pursue other ventures. He retired on July 27, 2007.

==Post-military career==
Giambastiani&#x27;s personal interests include amateur radio, for which he uses the call sign N4OC. He also currently serves as a guiding coalition member of the Project on National Security Reform. He also serves on the Advisory Board of Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory and the Board of Trustees of the Mitre Corporation.

On October 8, 2009, airplane maker Boeing Co. announced that Giambastiani had been elected to its board of directors, effective immediately. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; reported that &quot;In a statement, Boeing chairman and chief executive Jim McNerney indicated that the addition of Giambastiani, who was the second-highest ranking officer in the U.S. military, is intended [...] to boost Boeing&#x27;s influence with the Pentagon.&quot;

<doc id="735384" wikidata="Q122984535" url="?curid=735384" title="Interstate 238 and State Route 238 (California)">
<text>Route 238, consisting of State Route 238 (SR 238) and Interstate 238 (I-238), is a mostly north–south state and auxiliary Interstate highway in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. The southern segment is signed as SR 238 and is a divided multilane surface highway that runs parallel to the Hayward hills between I-680 in Fremont and I-580 in Castro Valley. The northern segment is signed as I-238 and is a six-lane freeway that runs more east–west between I-580 and I-880 in San Leandro.

The numbering of I-238 does not fit within the usual conventions of existing three-digit auxiliary Interstate Highways, where a single digit is prefixed to the two-digit number of its parent Interstate Highway as I-38 does not exist. The I-238 number was specifically requested by the state of California so it could match the California Streets and Highways Code and because all three-digit combinations of I-80 (the primary two-digit Interstate in the Bay Area) were already being used in the state.

==Route description==
Route 238 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

===SR 238===
SR 238 runs from I-680 in Fremont to Union City, Hayward and I-580 in Castro Valley parallel to the Hayward hills. Until I-680 was completed in the area and supplanted it completely as a through route, SR 238 extended south to San Jose at its intersection with US Route 101 (US 101). Locally, it is designated Mission Boulevard from I-680 to the intersection with SR 92 and SR 185 (which continues as Mission Boulevard) in Hayward. It is designated as Foothill Boulevard in northern Hayward from A Street to I-580.

In Downtown Hayward immediately north of SR 92, northbound traffic continues along the original SR 238 alignment on Foothill Boulevard, while southbound traffic is diverted onto A Street and Mission Boulevard. This loop of one-way streets is known as the &quot;Hayward Loop&quot;.

====Mission Boulevard====
Mission Boulevard, the former El Camino Viejo and El Camino Real, is the road that passes in front of Mission San José, the historic Spanish Mission founded in 1797, for which the road is named. Mission Boulevard proceeds in both directions from the Mission, but mainly northwest (the former El Camino Viejo) through Fremont, Union City, and Hayward. At the north end of Hayward, it changes its name to East 14th Street, which continues as a major thoroughfare going through San Leandro and Oakland. Since it runs along the base of the hills, Mission Boulevard nearly coincides with the Hayward Fault, a major earthquake fault, for almost the entire length of the Boulevard. The southern direction from the Mission San José is the former El Camino Real route to Mission Santa Clara de Asís.

Mission Boulevard joins the historic centers of the Mission San Jose and Niles districts of Fremont (formerly independent towns), the Decoto district of Union City (formerly an independent town), and Hayward.

===I-238===

Although the I-238 goes in an east–west direction from Castro Valley to San Leandro, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) officially signs it as a north–south freeway since the rest of SR 238 is more north–south. The southern (geographically eastern) terminus of I-238 is at its interchange with I-580 and SR 238 in Castro Valley. From there, it enters into the southern portion of the census-designated place of Ashland, running parallel to its border with Cherryland. Then, after entering San Leandro, I-238 ends at its northern (geographically western) terminus with I-880.

I-238 and I-880 are used as an alternate truck route between Castro Valley and Oakland; trucks over are prohibited through the latter on I-580.

====I-238 numbering====
I-238 does not follow established rules for numbering Interstates as there is no I-38. As it connects two auxiliary routes of I-80, it would normally use a three-digit number ending in 80, but, of the nine possible numbers, two (180 and 480) were in use by State Routes (the latter an Interstate until 1968 though SR 480 was deleted in 1991), and the remainder were already in use by other California auxiliary routes. (I-880 was designated at the same time as I-238.) I-238 is treated as auxiliary route of I-80 instead.

==History==
===State Route 9===
Before California massively renumbered its state highways in 1964, SR 238 was part of SR 9, which extended south to San Jose and Santa Cruz.

===Canceled Foothill/Mission Freeway project===
For several decades, SR 238 from I-680 in Fremont to Hayward was planned to be upgraded to a freeway, called the &quot;Mission&quot; or &quot;Foothill&quot; freeway. The segment was submitted to the Interstate Highway System in October 1968 but was rejected. Then, after years of various lawsuits and appeals, Caltrans decided to cancel the project in 2003 and sell off the property it had acquired in the name of eminent domain along the proposed route.

As an alternative, SR 238 was proposed to be expanded from two lanes in each direction to three lanes in each direction along the majority of its width. Various other improvements began in July 2010, followed by the California State Legislature relinquishing control of SR 238 within Hayward to local control in 2012. In March 2013, the routing in Downtown Hayward was changed to include a one way circulation known as the &quot;Hayward Loop&quot;, designed to improve traffic flow between SR 238, SR 185, and SR 92.

===I-238 segment===
The section of road that is now I-238 had no signed number before the 1964 renumbering; it was pre-1964 Legislative Route 228 (along with an unbuilt extension west to unbuilt SR 61, which is still included in the SR 238 definition). The segment was then built as a freeway in 1956. 

When I-880 was added to the Interstate Highway System as a renumbering of part of SR 17, the short piece of SR 238 connecting I-880 to I-580 was also added; both were non-chargeable routes (not eligible for Interstate Completion funds). Both numbers—I-238 and I-880—were approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on July 7, 1983. The interchanges with I-580 and I-880 were rebuilt from 1988 to 1994, in part to add missing ramps between I-238 and I-880 toward the south. Prior to the completion of the ramps, access was provided by Hesperian Boulevard.

On July 7, 1983, while approving the designation, AASHTO said:
On July 27, 1983, Caltrans responded:
With the decommissioning of SR 480 in 1991, the &quot;480&quot; designation was once again made available. However, there has been no push since then to renumber I-238 to I-480.

In September 2006, a project began to reconstruct the entire length of I-238, including a reconfigured interchange with I-880 and an added travel lane in each direction. Additionally, almost all the bridges and overpasses were replaced with new ones meeting current earthquake resistance standards. The project was completed in October 2009, six months ahead of schedule.

<text>Joseph Sampson Gamgee, (17 April 1828 – 18 September 1886) was a surgeon at the Queen&#x27;s Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England. He pioneered aseptic surgery (having once shared lodgings with Joseph Lister), and, in 1880 invented Gamgee Tissue, an absorbent cotton wool and gauze surgical dressing.

==Life==

He was born in Livorno, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, where his father, Joseph Gamgee (1801–1895), was a veterinary surgeon; Sampson&#x27;s mother and Joseph&#x27;s wife was Mary Ann West (1799–1873). He was the sibling of John Gamgee, inventor and Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Dick Veterinary College, Edinburgh and Arthur Gamgee. Sampson studied at the Royal Veterinary College, London. While a veterinary student, he was invited to attend lectures at University College Hospital and his work was so good that he was persuaded to become a student there. His classmate was Joseph Lister with whom he shared lodgings and considered him a close friend.

He obtained a post as House Surgeon at University College Hospital in London. He then served as a surgeon in the British-Italian Legion during the Crimean War. On his return in 1857 he took on the post of Surgeon at Queen&#x27;s Hospital in Birmingham.

In 1868 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Sir James Young Simpson.

In 1873 he founded the Birmingham Hospital Saturday Fund which raised money for various hospitals in Birmingham from overtime earnings given by workers on nominated &quot;Hospital Saturdays&quot;. It was the first such fund to raise money in this way for multiple hospitals. Sampson was also the first president of the Birmingham Medical Institute.

In 1881 he retired from active hospital life due to a Haematuria infection. In 1886 his health further worsened during a trip to Dartmouth where he fell fracturing his right femur at its head. He died of Bright&#x27;s disease in Birmingham on 18 September 1886.

*&quot;A Lecture on Ovariotomy&quot; (1871)
*&quot;On the Treatment of Wounds and Fractures&quot; (1883)

==Legacy==
He gave his name (indirectly, via the tissue) to the hobbit Sam Gamgee in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.
There is a blue plaque commemorating him on the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and a library is dedicated to him in the Birmingham Medical Institute.

==Family==

He married Marion Parker, daughter of an Edgbaston vet, in 1886. They had two sons and two daughters. One son, Leonard Parker Gamgee, was a surgeon in Birmingham and his nephew (son of his sister Fanny) was the biologist and classicist D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson.

<text>Xavier Roberts (born October 31, 1955, in Cleveland, Georgia) is best known for Cabbage Patch Kid dolls, once immensely popular soft sculpted dolls.

==Early life==
When Xavier Roberts was five, his father died in a car accident, leaving his mother to raise him and his five siblings. Roberts then attended White County High School and then attended Truett McConnell Junior College where he was an award-winning art student.

==Cabbage Patch Kids development==
In 1976, Xavier Roberts met Martha Nelson Thomas at a craft fair. He asked her to supply him with dolls to sell in Georgia, where he lived and worked. Thomas briefly let him sell her Doll Babies, but stopped. Thomas sued Roberts and won an undisclosed amount after the case was settled out of court. Roberts created his own version in 1978, and in 1982 he licensed the dolls to Coleco for mass-production under the name Cabbage Patch Kids.

Roberts travelled from state to state in the southeastern United States attending craft fairs and folk art exhibitions where he sold these Chinese-crafted dolls. He won awards for his work, including a first-place ribbon for a doll named Dexter at the Osceola Craft Show in Florida in 1978.

Going into business as Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc., Roberts hired local seamstresses and started producing his dolls in a converted medical clinic in his hometown of Cleveland. &quot;Babyland General Hospital&quot; still exists today in a new location.

By 1982, the Little People had evolved into Cabbage Patch Kids, licensed to Coleco. The Cabbage Patch Kids were a huge hit, quickly becoming a major toy fad. In 1984 alone, 20 million dolls were bought, and by 1999, 95 million dolls had been sold worldwide.

==Furskin Bears creation==
Roberts would later create a series of country-inspired toy bears called the Furskin Bears.

==Accomplishments==
Due to the commercial success of his Little People line, Roberts had already become a millionaire by the age of 26.

Other artwork by Roberts has been featured in galleries such as the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. His creations also became part of the State of Georgia&#x27;s permanent art collection after Roberts presented three Little People to Georgia Governor George Busbee.

<doc id="735397" wikidata="Q179846" url="?curid=735397" title="Dzhokhar Dudayev">
<text>Dzhokhar Musayevich Dudayev (born Dudin Musa-Khant Dzhokhar; 15 February 1944 – 21 April 1996) was a Chechen politician, statesman and military leader of the 1990s Chechen independence movement from Russia. He served as the first president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria from 1991 until his assassination in 1996. Dudayev had previously served as a senior officer in the Soviet Air Forces.

Dudayev was born in Chechnya in 1944, days before his family and the entire Chechen nation were deported to Central Asia by the Soviet regime in the Chechen genocide as part of an ethnic cleansing program which affected several million members of ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union between the 1930s and 1950s. His family was allowed to return to his native Chechnya in 1956, after Joseph Stalin’s death. From 1962, Dudayev served in the Soviet Air Forces, reaching the rank of major general. He commanded strategic nuclear bomber aircraft divisions based in Poltava and Tartu, and was awarded several state orders of the Soviet Union, most notably the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of the Red Star.

In 1991, Dudayev refused orders from Moscow to suppress Estonia&#x27;s independence movement, and subsequently resigned from the Soviet Armed Forces before returning to Chechnya. He became president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria after a referendum in October 1991, and unilaterally declared the republic&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union. In the First Chechen War (1994–1996), Dudayev organized a successful resistance against Russian forces before he was assassinated by a Russian airstrike. Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, was renamed Dzhokhar-Ghala in Dudayev&#x27;s honor between 1996 and 2005.

==Early life and military career==
Dudayev was born in Yalkhoroy from the Tsechoy teip in the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), just a few days before the forced deportation of his family together with the entire Chechen population on the orders of Lavrentiy Beria. He was the thirteenth youngest child of veterinarian Musa and Rabiat Dudayev. He spent the first 13 years of his life in internal exile in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. His family was only able to return to Chechnya in 1957. Following the 1957 repatriation of the Chechens, he studied at evening school in Checheno-Ingushetia and qualified as an electrician. In 1962, after two years studying electronics in Vladikavkaz, he entered the Tambov Higher Military Aviation School for Pilots from which he graduated in 1966. Dudayev joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1968 and from 1971 to 1974 studied at the prestigious Gagarin Air Force Academy. He married Alla, a Russian poet and the daughter of a Soviet officer, with whom he had three children (a daughter and two sons).

In 1962, Dudayev began serving in the Soviet Air Force where he rose to the rank of Major-General, becoming its first Chechen general. Dudayev served in a strategic bombing unit of the Soviet Air Force in Siberia and Ukraine. He allegedly participated in the Soviet–Afghan War against the Mujahideen, for which he was awarded the Order of the Red Star and the Order of the Red Banner. Reportedly from 1986 to 1987, Dudayev had participated in bombing raids in western Afghanistan. Dudayev had stated he was personally a &quot;dedicated Muslim.&quot; He politically stressed Chechen nationalism as president. Many of his military and political opponents who questioned his Muslim faith often made reference to his actions against the Mujahideen forces. For example, Sergei Stepashin asserted Dudayev participated in carpet bombing (a statement probably motivated by spite). These allegations were denied by Dudayev himself. Dudayev rose steadily in the Air Force, assuming command of the 326th Heavy Bomber Aviation Division of the Soviet Long Range Aviation at Tartu, Estonia, in 1987 gaining the rank of Major-General. From 1987 through March 1990, he commanded nuclear-armed long-range strategic bombers during his post there.

He was also commander of the garrison of Tartu. He learned Estonian and showed great tolerance for restoration of Estonian independence when in autumn 1990 he ignored the orders (as commander of the garrison of Tartu) to shut down the Estonian television and parliament. In 1990, his air division was withdrawn from Estonia and Dudayev resigned from the Soviet military.

==Chechen politics==
In May 1990, Dudayev returned to Grozny, the Chechen capital, to devote himself to local politics. He was elected head of the Executive Committee of the unofficial opposition All-National Congress of the Chechen People (NCChP), which advocated sovereignty for Chechnya as a separate republic of the Soviet Union (the Chechen-Ingush ASSR had the status of an autonomous republic of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic).

In August 1991, Doku Zavgayev, the Communist leader of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, did not publicly condemn the August 1991 attempted coup d&#x27;état against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Following the failure of the putsch, the Soviet Union began to disintegrate rapidly as the constituent republics took moves to leave the beleaguered Soviet Union. Taking advantage of the Soviet Union&#x27;s implosion, Dudayev and his supporters acted against the Zavgayev administration. On 6 September 1991, the militants of the NCChP violently (the Grozny Communist party leader was killed and several other members were wounded) invaded a session of the local Supreme Soviet, effectively dissolving the government of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. Grozny television station and other key government buildings were also taken over. Dudayev and his supporters stated that the revolution had occurred and that the revolutionary committee would assume all power before the snap presidential elections.

==President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria==
After a referendum in October 1991 confirmed Dudayev in his new position as president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, he declared the republic&#x27;s sovereignty and its independence from the Russia Federation. In November 1991, the then Russian President Boris Yeltsin dispatched troops to Grozny, but they were withdrawn when Dudayev&#x27;s forces prevented them from leaving the airport. Russia refused to recognize the republic&#x27;s independence, but hesitated to use further force against the separatists. From this point, the Checheno-Ingush Republic had become a &quot;de facto&quot; independent state.

Initially, Dudayev&#x27;s government had diplomatic relations with Georgia where he received much moral support from the first Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. When Gamsakhurdia was overthrown in late 1991, he was given asylum in Chechnya and attended Dudayev&#x27;s inauguration as President. While he resided in Grozny he also helped to organise the first &quot;All-Caucasian Conference&quot; which was attended by independentist groups from across the region. Ichkeria never received diplomatic recognition from any internationally recognised state other than Georgia in 1991.

The Chechen-Ingush Republic split in two in June 1992, amidst the increasing Ossetian-Ingush conflict. After Chechnya had announced its initial declaration of sovereignty in 1991, its former entity Ingushetia opted to join the Russian Federation as a federal subject (Republic of Ingushetia). The remaining rump state of Ichkeria (Chechnya) declared full independence in 1993. That same year the Russian language stopped being taught in Chechen schools and it was also announced that the Chechen language would start to be written using the Latin alphabet (with some additional special Chechen characters) rather than Cyrillic in use since the 1930s. The state also began to print its own money and stamps. One of Dudayev&#x27;s first decrees gave every man the right to bear arms.

In 1993, the Chechen parliament attempted to organize a referendum on public confidence in Dudayev on the grounds that he had failed to consolidate Chechnya&#x27;s independence. He retaliated by dissolving parliament and other organs of power. Beginning in early summer of 1994, armed Chechen opposition groups with Russian military and financial backing tried repeatedly but without success to depose Dudayev by force.

==First Chechen War==
On 1 December 1994, the Russians began bombing Grozny airport and destroyed some former Soviet training aircraft taken away by the republic in 1991. In response, Ichkeria mobilised its armed forces. On 11 December 1994, five days after Dudayev and Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev of Russia had agreed to avoid the further use of force, Russian troops invaded Chechnya.

Before the fall of Grozny, Dudayev abandoned the presidential palace, moved south with his forces and continued leading the war throughout 1995, reportedly from a missile silo close to the historic Chechen capital of Vedeno. He continued to insist that his forces would prevail after the conventional warfare had finished, and the Chechen guerrilla fighters continued to operate across the entire republic. The full-scale Russian attack led many of Dudayev&#x27;s opponents to side with his forces and thousands of volunteers to swell the ranks of mobile militant units.

==Assassination==
On 21 April 1996, while using a satellite phone, Dudayev was assassinated by two laser-guided missiles, after his location was detected by a Russian reconnaissance aircraft, which intercepted his phone call. At the time, Dudayev was talking to Konstantin Borovoy, a deputy of the State Duma in Moscow. Additional aircraft were dispatched (a Su-24MR and a Su-25) to locate Dudayev and fire a guided missile. Exact details of this operation have not been released by the Russian government. Russian reconnaissance planes in the area had been monitoring satellite communications for some time trying to match Dudayev&#x27;s voice signature to the existing samples of his speech. It was claimed Dudayev was killed by a combination of an airstrike and a booby trap. He was 52 years old.

The death of Dudayev was announced on the interrupted television broadcast by Shamil Basayev, the Chechen guerrilla commander. Dudayev was succeeded by his Vice-President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev (as acting President) and then, after the 1997 popular elections, by his wartime Chief of Staff, Aslan Maskhadov.

Dudayev was survived by his wife, Alla, and their sons.

==Commemoration==
There is a memorial plaque made of granite attached to the house on 8 Ülikooli street, Tartu, Estonia, in which Dudayev used to work. The house now hosts Hotel Barclay, and the former office of Dudayev has been converted into Dudayev&#x27;s Room.

Places named in honor of Dudayev include: 
* – There is a street in the Georgian capital Tbilisi named after Dzokhar Dudayev.
* – In 1996, a street in the Latvian capital Riga was named &quot; (Dzhokhar Dudaev Street). In the light of the upcoming Parliamentary elections in Latvia, several initiatives have been undertaken to lobby for the renaming or preserving the name of the street by pro-Russian and anti-Russian political parties respectively.
* – &quot; (Dzhokhar Dudaev Square) in the Žvėrynas district of Vilnius. 
* – On 17 March 2005, a roundabout in the Polish capital Warsaw was named &quot;&quot; (Roundabout Dzhokhar Dudayev).
* – After Dudayev&#x27;s death, various locations in Turkey were renamed after him, such as &#x27; (Martyr Dzhokhar Dudaev Street) and &#x27; (Martyr Dzhokhar Dudayev Park) in Istanbul/Ataşehir-Örnek, &#x27; (Dzhokhar Dudayev Square) in Ankara, &#x27; (Martyr Dzhokhar Dudaev Park) in Adapazarı, Sakarya and &quot; in Sivas.
* – In 1996, a street in Lviv was named &quot; (Dzhokhar Dudayev Street), later followed by a street in Ivano-Frankivsk and a street in Khmelnytskyi. In the war in Donbas, that started in the spring of 2014, a pro-Ukrainian volunteer battalion was named after Dudayev, led by former Chechen General Isa Munayev. In December 2022 recently liberated (from Russian forces) Izium decided to rename Turgenev Street to Dzhokhar Dudayev Street. In May 2023 Poltava renamed Nikitchenko Street in honor of Dzhokhar Dudayev.

<text>Administrative and territorial division of the [[Bashkortostan|Republic of Bashkortostan]] is regulated by the Law #178-z of the Republic of Bashkortostan, passed by the State Assembly—Kurultai on April 20, 2005. The Law established the following classification:
*administrative units ():
**[[raion|district]] ()—an administrative unit established to govern selsoviets, rural settlement councils, and towns under that district&#x27;s jurisdiction. Districts cover territories with population of at least 20,000.
**[[selsoviet]] ()—an administrative unit established to govern one or several rural localities with adjacent territories. Selsoviets cover territories with populations of at least 1,000.
**settlement council ()—an administrative unit established to govern an urban-type settlement with adjacent territories and/or selsoviets. Settlement councils have not been implemented in practice.
*inhabited localities ():
**urban localities ():
***city/town under republic&#x27;s jurisdiction ();
****city district ()—an administrative unit of cities under republic&#x27;s jurisdiction established to improve municipal government efficiency.
***city/town under a district&#x27;s jurisdiction ()
***urban-type settlement ():
****work settlement ();
****suburban (dacha) settlement (); not implemented in practice;
****resort settlement (); not implemented in practice
**rural localities ():
***aul ();
***khutor ();
***selo ();
***village ()
**[[closed town|closed administrative-territorial formations]] ()—territories under the federal government management with travel and residency restrictions; usually military objects.

All administrative units have administrative centers, defined as urban or rural localities housing the Government of the Republic of Bashkortostan, or municipal and local government organs.

Changes in the overall administrative and territorial structure of the Republic are authorized by the State Assembly—Kurultai. All changes must later be registered in the Russian Classification of Objects of Administrative Division on the federal level.

<text>WJAX-TV (channel 47) is a television station in Jacksonville, Florida, United States, affiliated with CBS. It is owned by Hoffman Communications, which maintains a joint sales agreement (JSA) with Cox Media Group, owner of Fox and Telemundo affiliate WFOX-TV (channel 30), for the provision of certain services. The two stations share studios on Central Parkway; WJAX-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Hogan Road, both in Jacksonville&#x27;s Southside section.

==History==
The station was the brainchild of John Stone Thigpenn who, while working as an announcer at Christian radio station WBIX (1010 AM, now WJXL) during May 1977, read Pat Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Shout it From the Housetops,&quot; Robertson&#x27;s personal account of how he founded the Christian Broadcasting Network. Thigpenn, who gained faith to create a similar venture in Jacksonville, mentioned on the air that he wanted to start a Christian television station in the Jacksonville market. Within minutes of this announcement, listener Janice Paulk from Fernandina Beach called to ask who she should make a check out to in support of the effort. Thigpenn suggested the name &quot;Christian Television of Jacksonville,&quot; knowing he could later formally create a business license and banking account under that name. Three days later, a check for $1,000 was received from Paulk.

Further inspired by such a generous donation, Thigpenn contacted his friend Russell Linenkohl, president of the local Full Gospel Businessmen&#x27;s Association. Linenkohl suggested teaming up with other Christian business leaders to jointly discuss how best to proceed. Included in that group were physicians already known by Thigpenn, Stephen Gyland and Douglas Fowler. Other businessmen being recommended were local bankers Richard Martin, Rufus Kite Powell and Thomas McGehee. The group agreed to hold a public meeting to invite citizen comments regarding the endeavor. At the end of this public meeting, the attendees voted to appoint the head table to form a selection committee tasked with appointing and forming a board of directors for Christian Television of Jacksonville.

Before the public meeting, Thigpenn had already contacted the Broadcast Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to discover that two UHF channel allocations (channels 30 and 47) were available for use in Jacksonville. He also discovered that two entities were already competing for the channel 30 frequency. The group decided to avoid the time and expense of litigating a challenge for that allotment and opted to file for a license to operate a station on channel 47. Thigpenn, who did not share the same community prominence as the other appointing members, agreed to act as a silent partner to the newly appointed board of directors for Christian Television of Jacksonville. He subsequently headed up the Community Ascertainment requirement as one of several exhibits needed by the FCC as part of the license application process.

While Christian Television of Jacksonville received the construction permit and eventual license from the FCC, it did not garner the expected financial donations from the community to sustain its operating costs. The board then decided to transfer the ownership to Thomas McGehee, who was serving as the board&#x27;s president. McGehee and his brother Frank McGehee formed North Florida Television Incorporated, which was awarded the license transfer by the FCC. Thigpenn was appointed to the new board and was listed as a principal on the newly granted license.

After all the planning and financing, the station officially signed on the air on August 1, 1980, as WXAO-TV (standing for the Greek letters for &quot;Christ, the Alpha and Omega&quot;). It first broadcast from studio facilities located on University Boulevard/SR 109 on Jacksonville&#x27;s Southside. It was the first independent station in Jacksonville. Thigpenn served as the station&#x27;s first news director during its first four years on the air. The station intended to be a family-friendly alternative to the network programs on the market&#x27;s commercial television stations; it carried religious programs from the PTL Satellite Network, the Christian Television Network and the Trinity Broadcasting Network, as well as secular programs including cartoons, westerns and a few classic sitcoms. WXAO was the first television station in Jacksonville to broadcast on a 24-hour schedule. However, it never generated very high viewership. Gradually, the station abandoned most of its religious programming and transitioned to a general-entertainment independent format. On June 27, 1983, the station changed its call letters to WNFT. At that point, it began running more movies and drama series. By 1989, it was airing a blend of cartoons, recent off-network sitcoms and drama series, and movies. The McGehees sold WNFT to Krypton Broadcasting in 1990 for approximately $3 million; Krypton owned two other stations with similar formats, WTVX in West Palm Beach and WABM in Birmingham, Alabama.

Krypton filed for bankruptcy in 1993 and sold its stations to separate owners over the next year. In October 1994, WNFT was sold to RDS Broadcasting, which entered into a local marketing agreement with Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), owner of Fox affiliate WAWS (channel 30). WNFT integrated its operations into that station&#x27;s studio facilities on Central Parkway; the two stations pooled resources and programming, while running the strongest syndicated programs (including cartoons and sitcoms) on WAWS. Meanwhile, WNFT restructured its schedule to focus largely on older cartoons, movies, sitcoms and drama series. It became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN) when the network launched on January 16, 1995. The station changed its call letters to WTEV-TV (which had previously been used by present-day ABC affiliate WLNE-TV in New Bedford, Massachusetts, as a CBS affiliate) on March 4, 1996. During the late 1990s, WTEV began decreasing its reliance on classic sitcoms, cut back on cartoons, and began to focus more of its programming inventory on talk and reality shows. Clear Channel would buy the station outright in 2000, creating the second television duopoly in the Jacksonville market.

===Joining CBS===

On April 23, 2002, CBS signed an affiliation agreement with Clear Channel for WTEV-TV to become the new CBS affiliate for the Jacksonville television market. The network&#x27;s longtime affiliate, WJXT (channel 4), chose not to renew its affiliation agreement with the network after CBS supplied the station&#x27;s owner, Post-Newsweek Stations (now the Graham Media Group), with a list of demands that included the payment of reverse compensation to the network (instead of receiving payments, as was the case in the past) to continue carrying CBS programming and limiting preemptions of CBS programming to events where breaking news and severe weather coverage necessitate it. WTEV officially became a CBS affiliate on July 15, 2002, with WJXT opting to become an independent station. In addition, this triggered an affiliation switch in Gainesville where WGFL, once a WB affiliate, became a CBS affiliate. At the time, WAWS assumed the UPN affiliation on a secondary basis (airing it on a tape delay from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.) and acquired several syndicated sitcoms that WTEV no longer had room on its schedule to air (coincidentally, both CBS and UPN were owned by the original Viacom at the time). WTEV also began carrying most Jacksonville Jaguars regular season games through CBS&#x27; broadcast rights to the NFL&#x27;s American Football Conference division, along with many high-profile college football games through the network&#x27;s contract with the Southeastern Conference, including the annual Florida–Georgia football rivalry game held at EverBank Field on the first Saturday of November.

With WTEV obtaining the CBS affiliation, the situation resulted in the first instance where two broadcasting companies controlled the Big Four network affiliates in one market (the Gannett Company owns both ABC affiliate WJXX (channel 25) and NBC affiliate WTLV (channel 12)), as well as making Jacksonville one of the only United States television markets with all six major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, and at the time, UPN and The WB) having affiliations with only five stations in a six station-market (which remains the case in the present day with UPN and WB successors The CW and MyNetworkTV) and one of the few where an analog-era VHF station has no network affiliation while all the other stations in the market do.

On April 20, 2007, Clear Channel entered into an agreement to sell its television stations to Newport Television, a newly formed television station group controlled by private equity firm Providence Equity Partners. Since WTEV was also included in the deal, this would have violated FCC rules preventing common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market as defined by total-day ratings. Clear Channel had bought WTEV when it was a low-rated UPN affiliate, but by this point had surpassed WJXT and WCWJ (channel 17) in total-day viewership. As a result, the FCC granted Newport Television a temporary waiver for the acquisition of WTEV and WAWS, with the stipulation that Newport sell one of the stations within six months of closure. With that, the company was able to complete its purchase of the station group on March 14, 2008. After the group deal closed on March 14, 2008, Newport had originally planned to sell off WAWS to another company while retaining ownership of WTEV.
However in May 2008, it agreed to sell the license assets of WTEV and five other Newport stations to High Plains Broadcasting due to ownership conflicts in the affected markets; the purchase was finalized on September 15 of that year. As the deal was a sale in name only, Newport continued to operate the stations (and thus, WTEV effectively remained a sister outlet to WAWS) after the sale closed on September 15. It effectively made High Plains Broadcasting a front company or &quot;shell corporation&quot; for Newport Television similar to the existing relationships between the Nexstar Broadcasting Group and Mission Broadcasting and the Sinclair Broadcast Group and Cunningham Broadcasting. This arrangement also placed WTEV in the unusual position of being the junior partner in a virtual duopoly with a Fox affiliate (the Big Three station normally serves as the senior partner in most virtual or legal duopolies involving a Fox affiliate and a Big Three-affiliated station).

On July 19, 2012, Newport Television announced the sale of WAWS and WTEV-TV to Cox Media Group, in a four-station deal that also involved the Tulsa, Oklahoma sister duopoly of KOKI-TV and KMYT-TV. The sale to Cox placed WAWS and WTEV under common ownership with the company&#x27;s radio station cluster in Jacksonville (WOKV (690 AM and 106.5 FM, now WHJX), WFYV-FM (104.5, now WOKV-FM), WJGL (96.9), WXXJ (102.9, now WEZI) and WAPE-FM (95.1)) as well as Cox&#x27;s Orlando duopoly of ABC affiliate WFTV and independent station WRDQ. Due to the very same rules that forced the license of WTEV to be transferred to a separate licensee back in 2008, Cox acquired WAWS outright and transferred WTEV&#x27;s license assets to Bayshore Television, LLC, which then turned over WTEV&#x27;s operations to Cox under a joint sales agreement. The FCC approved the transaction on October 24, and it was finalized on December 3.

On August 26, 2014, Cox announced their intention to change WTEV&#x27;s call letters to WJAX-TV, contingent on FCC approval, through a request made in July. In an email to &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot;, general manager Jim Zerwekh stated that the change would better associate the station with Jacksonville. Concurrently with the change to WJAX-TV, sister station WAWS was renamed WFOX-TV. The change took effect on September 7, 2014. The WJAX call letters were also used in Jacksonville on 1220 AM; the two stations were not related, as WJAX radio was owned by Jones College.

On February 27, 2018, it was announced that Bayshore Television would sell WJAX-TV to Hoffman Communications for $1.2 million. Cox would continue to operate the station. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 17, 2018, and was completed on May 8.

In February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting&#x27;s stations (including the JSA with WJAX-TV). Although the group planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was later announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox&#x27;s radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name. The sale was completed on December 17, 2019.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
Since its 2002 affiliation switch to CBS, then-WTEV-TV became the official broadcaster of most Jacksonville Jaguars regular-season games due to the network&#x27;s contract involving AFC teams. The first Jaguars game to air on the station as the new CBS affiliate was the team&#x27;s Week 1 home game versus the Indianapolis Colts on September 8, 2002.

WJAX simulcast Yahoo!&#x27;s broadcast of the Jaguars game in London against the Buffalo Bills in October 2015, per NFL rules requiring simulcasting on over-the-air stations in the markets of the participating teams. It was the first ever streaming-exclusive broadcast of an NFL game.

===News operation===
WJAX-TV presently broadcasts 30 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays); in addition, the station produces the sports highlight programs &quot;Action Sports Jax Primetime&quot;, which airs weekend evenings at 11:30 p.m. (the station also produces a half-hour version of the program for WFOX-TV after its 10 p.m. newscast on weekends) and &quot;Friday Night Blitz&quot;, which airs Fridays at 11:15 pm. The stations use Doppler radar data from the National Weather Service Forecast Office near Jacksonville International Airport.

In the late 1990s, WAWS began producing a half-hour early evening newscast for WTEV titled &quot;UPN 47 News at 6:30&quot;, which aired Monday through Fridays; the 6:30 broadcast was canceled in June 2002, a couple of weeks prior to the affiliation switch. Once WTEV became a CBS affiliate in July 2002, the station expanded its local news programming, adding a full slate newscasts at 5:30 a.m. (effectively &quot;moving&quot; over from WAWS), noon, 5, 5:30, 6 and 11 p.m. on Monday through Fridays, along with weekend evening newscasts. WAWS&#x27;s existing news department essentially took over primary newscast production for the station. Initially, WTEV maintained certain primary personnel (such as news anchors) that would only appear on the newscasts on channel 47. In addition, newscasts used separate on-air branding and graphics packages, with WTEV&#x27;s newscasts being conducted from the duopoly&#x27;s newsroom to distinguish the two outlets and retain separate on-air identities.

In the late 2000s, WTEV&#x27;s weekday morning newscast began to be simulcast on WAWS. Corresponding with the change, &quot;Action News This Morning&quot; was expanded to two hours (from 5 to 7 a.m.), with a two-hour extension of the program (from 7 to 9 a.m. eventually being added on WAWS. WAWS would later break away from the unified brand and introduce its own separate graphics and music package, and logo based on those originated in the mid-2000s on Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations on September 19, 2010. On April 13, 2009, WTEV and WAWS began using a single on-air identity for their respective newscasts, branding their news programming collectively as &quot;Action News&quot;, presumably done as a way to compete with the &quot;First Coast News&quot; operation of rivals WTLV and WJXX. With the overhaul came the introduction of new sets (with WAWS maintaining a separate set for its nightly 10 p.m. newscast), on-air graphics, weather center and website.

On January 31, 2010, WTEV/WAWS became the second television news operation in the Jacksonville market to begin broadcasting their local newscasts in high definition (after WJXT, which upgraded on January 14, 2009; WTLV/WJXX upgraded their newscasts to HD the day after WAWS/WTEV&#x27;s conversion to high definition newscasts). In 2010, WAWS/WTEV began airing a half-hour extension of its weekday morning newscast for channel 30 at 4:30 a.m. (WTEV continues to start its morning newscast at 5 a.m. as it carries the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; in the 4:30 slot on a half-hour tape delay). On May 28, 2014, Cox Media Group management fired five WAWS/WTEV anchors—weeknight anchors Mark Spain, Tera Barz and Paige Kelton (the latter of whom had been with the news department since its 1997 establishment on WAWS), and morning anchors Lynnsey Gardner and Mike Barz—in a restructuring of its news staff; all five anchors are expected to leave the stations on or around September 1. The layoffs drew criticism from Jacksonville city council president Bill Guilford stating that Cox Media Group &quot;exercised bad judgment&quot; in cutting the five anchors.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
On April 1, 2014, Cox Media Group signed an affiliation agreement to carry the digital multicast movie network GetTV on WTEV-TV; the station began carrying the network in the summer of 2014 on subchannel 47.2, replacing Live Well Network. Sometime in 2020, GetTV on 47.2 was replaced by Cozi TV, which has been airing on WRCZ-LD 35.3.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
On June 12, 2009, WJAX-TV (as WTEV-TV) terminated its analog signal, on UHF channel 47, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, using virtual channel 47.

<text>Gamgee Tissue is a surgical dressing invented by Joseph Sampson Gamgee, a doctor in Birmingham, England, in 1880.

== Surgical dressing ==

Gamgee Tissue has a thick layer of absorbent cotton wool between two layers of absorbent gauze. It represents the first use of cotton wool in a medical context, and was a major advancement in the prevention of infection of surgical wounds. It is still the basis for many modern surgical dressings. The name has been a trademark of Robinson Healthcare (formerlyl Robinson and Sons Ltd of Chesterfield), based in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, since 1911.

== Tolkien ==

In Birmingham, &quot;Gamgee&quot; became the colloquial name for cotton wool, which led to the surname of Gaffer Gamgee and his son Sam in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In a 1954 letter to the author Naomi Mitchison, who was checking the text of the novel for Tolkien, he addresses a question she had about the name:

<doc id="735411" wikidata="Q2307647" url="?curid=735411" title="Palace of Facets">
<text>The Palace of the Facets () is a building in the Moscow Kremlin, Russia, which contains what used to be the main banquet reception hall of the Russian tsars. It is the oldest preserved secular building in Moscow. Located on Kremlin Cathedral Square, between the Cathedral of the Annunciation and the Dormition Cathedral. Currently, it is an official ceremonial hall in the residence of the President of the Russian Federation and thus admission is limited to prearranged tours only.

==Building==
Named after its distinctive stonework eastern façade with horizontal rows of sharp-edged stones, the Palace of Facets is all that is left of a larger royal palace made of white limestone. Although from the façade, it appears to be a three-story rectangular building from the outside, it is actually a one-story building with a semi-basement. On the west side, the building is directly connected to the central building of the Grand Kremlin Palace.

The first floor of the Palace of the Facets consists of the main hall and adjoining sacred vestibule. Both are decorated with rich frescoes and gilded carvings. The vaulted main hall has an area of about 500 m2 (5,380 ft2). The entire vault and the walls are frescoed with elaborate several themes from the history of the Russian State and the Russian Orthodox Church. This was used as a throne room and banqueting hall for the 16th-century and 17th-century tsars and is still used for holding formal state receptions. The paintings were restored in the 1880s by icon painters from Palekh by order of Tsar Alexander III.

On the palace&#x27;s southern facade is the Red Porch, an external staircase decorated with stylized lion sculptures on the railings. The tsars passed down this staircase on their way to the Cathedral of the Dormition for their coronations. The last such procession was at the coronation of Nicholas II in 1896. In the Streltsy Uprising in 1682, several of Tsar Peter the Great&#x27;s rebellious relatives were hurled down the staircase onto the pikes of the Streltsy guard. Demolished by Joseph Stalin in the 1930s and replaced with a canteen for Kremlin workers, the staircase was rebuilt in 1994 at great expense.

==History==
In 1487, Grand Duke Ivan III commissioned two Italian Renaissance architects, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, to build a stone palace after a series of fires that had ravaged the then predominantly wooden Kremlin. The new palace was completed in 1492 and served as the most important venue for formal receptions of the Tsar, coronation celebrations, feasts, and state ceremonies. Tsar Ivan the Terrible celebrated his conquest of the Kazan Khanate at the Palace of Facets for three days in 1552. Likewise, Tsar Peter the Great used the palace to celebrate his 1709 victory over Sweden at the Battle of Poltava and the end of the Great Northern War in 1721. It was also within the Palace of Facets that the Zemsky Sobor was held in 1654, resulting in the Treaty of Pereyaslav uniting the Russian Empire with Ukraine.

Over the centuries, the Palace of Facets suffered repeatedly from major fires damage and was rebuilt several times in its history. However, it has continued to be used for state receptions even in modern times, including the 1994 state visit of Queen Elizabeth II. In June 2012, after an extensive restoration, the Palace of Facets was reopened to public, though in practice only organized prearranged tours are available.

<text>Cotton wool consists of silky fibers taken from cotton plants in their raw state. Impurities, such as seeds, are removed and the cotton is then bleached using hydrogen peroxide or sodium hypochlorite and sterilized. It is also a refined product (&quot;absorbent cotton&quot; in U.S. usage) which has medical, cosmetic and many other practical uses.

The first medical use of cotton wool was by Joseph Sampson Gamgee at the Queen&#x27;s Hospital (later the General Hospital) in Birmingham, England. Although cotton wool is called cotton wool it is actually not wool at all. It is from the cotton plant. Most cotton comes from India, the United States, or China. Cotton plants prefer heavy soil to grow well.

<doc id="735416" wikidata="Q758001" url="?curid=735416" title="California State Route 92">
<text>State Route 92 (SR 92) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California, serving as a major east-west corridor in the San Francisco Bay Area. From its west end at State Route 1 in Half Moon Bay near the coast, it heads east across the San Francisco Peninsula and the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge to downtown Hayward in the East Bay at its junction with State Route 238 and State Route 185. It has interchanges with three freeways: Interstate 280 (the Junipero Serra Freeway), U.S. Route 101 (the Bayshore Freeway) in or near San Mateo, and Interstate 880 (the Nimitz Freeway) in Hayward. It also connects indirectly to Interstates 238 and 580 by way of Hayward&#x27;s Foothill Boulevard, which carries Route 238 and flows directly into Route 92.

==Route description==
Between Half Moon Bay and Interstate 280, Route 92 winds through the Coast Range as a narrow, mainly undivided two and three lane highway with a switchback turn. The east-bound uphill portion was upgraded with a long passing lane. Between Interstate 280 and Interstate 880 it is entirely a divided multilane highway, including the toll San Mateo-Hayward Bridge, the longest span across the San Francisco Bay; west of that bridge, Route 92 is carried on twin girder bridges across Seal Slough, which forms the border between the cities of San Mateo and Foster City. East of Interstate 880 the route becomes a divided surface street in Hayward, locally known as Jackson Street.

State Route 92 traverses through significant habitat areas including wetland, California oak woodland, chaparral and grassland. In one serpentine soil location near Crystal Springs Reservoir, it passes near one of the only known colonies of the endangered wildflower &quot;Pentachaeta bellidiflora&quot; and near one of the limited number of colonies of the endangered &quot;Eriophyllum latilobum&quot;.

SR 92 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and a small portion near SR 1 as well as the entire portion east of I-280 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 92 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.


==History==
The alignment was designated as Legislative Route Number 105 by Caltrans in 1933.

The San Mateo section also was referred to as the 19th Avenue Freeway which was the street name where the freeway now exists. Parts of the street remain. This section is also known as the J. Arthur Younger Freeway; J. Arthur Younger was a United States representative who served during the 1950s and 60s. On August 29, 1963, the 19th Avenue segment was completed and by 1964, the present name had been adopted; planning began for the segments in Alameda County, east of the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge, and the remainder in San Mateo County, west of Interstate 280.

===Updates===
An upgrade of the intersection with Main Street in Half Moon Bay, near the western terminus, was scheduled to be completed by fall 2008.

The old cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 880 was converted into a three-level combination interchange with direct ramp replacements for two of the tight &quot;cloverleaf&quot; ramps, and a new wider and taller overpass to carry Route 92 over Interstate 880. The project took four years and was completed in October 2011.

A similar cloverleaf interchange at SR 82 (El Camino Real) was rebuilt in 2018 into a partial cloverleaf interchange. Two of the loop off-ramps from SR 92 were eliminated: from westbound SR 92 to northbound El Camino Real, and from eastbound SR 92 to southbound El Camino Real. The remaining off-ramps were widened and signalized to allow left and right turns onto El Camino Real.

Planning for improvements to the interchange with the Bayshore Freeway (U.S. 101) began in 2018; construction is scheduled to begin in 2024. In addition, a separated bikeway will be built on Fashion Island Boulevard, which largely follows the former alignment of 19th Avenue, connecting the cities of Foster City and San Mateo. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026.

<text>Hacienda Village (founded 1949) is a defunct town located in central Broward County, Florida in the United States. It possessed both a police and fire department as well as various other municipal agencies, yet still relied heavily on Broward County for many services. It was disincorporated in 1984 (allegedly having its charter revoked after the HVPD cited an influential state representative for a traffic infraction) and was subsequently absorbed into the nearby town of Davie, Florida.

The community had a reputation as a speed trap. Steve Weller of the &quot;Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel&quot; stated that while Patton Village, Texas, an area known as a &quot;speed trap,&quot; had reduced its monthly citation count from 1,100 to 400, &quot;They tell me that, on a really cranky day, Hacienda Village speed trappers could issue that many tickets before lunch.&quot; The Mayor of Hacienda Village, &quot;Red&quot; Crise, originally from New Jersey, appointed himself the Police Chief, Fire Chief and Judge Magistrate. Crise presided over some 18 police officers as well as nightly traffic court. He apparently gloried in his reputation as a difficult person, once saying &quot;If you&#x27;re a redheaded man, you&#x27;re either a sissy or a son of a bitch. I&#x27;m not a sissy.&quot;

Hacienda Village was composed of 14 mobile homes and three junkyards with a population that varied between 150 and 200. The small town sat at the intersection of State Road 7 and State Road 84, two major roads in South Florida over which they had jurisdiction. Residents were not taxed, as the town always had a healthy surplus of funds from traffic fines, a large percentage coming from tourists who knew nothing about the town&#x27;s reputation. The fines were a result of some fancy and obscure speed limit postings which were heavily enforced by highly efficient police officers. A second tactic was enforcement of the law prohibiting turns that crossed double yellow lines, which caught many unwary motorists as they turned into one of the three bars and truck stop along the road.

In August 1970 the town stopped writing tickets on the two state roads while awaiting a ruling on their jurisdiction. In October 1970 the Florida State Attorney General ordered the town to stop writing tickets on the State Roads since all state roads come under the jurisdiction of the state. The Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) is the only law enforcement agency authorized to write tickets and investigate accidents on state roads.

As with Andytown, it was crippled by the construction of the interstate system, for the Interstate 595 spur, along the State Road 84 corridor, removed most of its revenue, rerouting traffic from SR 84 to I-595. I-595 runs from the Hollywood/Fort Lauderdale International Airport at US 1 to the junction of I-75, where it veers west towards Andytown and Naples.

<text>Koninklijke Ahold N.V. was a Dutch multinational retail company based in Zaandam, Netherlands. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, Sr., the company initially began as a single grocery store in Oostzaan and became the largest grocery chain in the Netherlands in 1970s, Netherlands. The company went public in 1948. It merged with Belgium-based Delhaize Group in 2016 to form Ahold Delhaize.

==History==

===Growth in the Netherlands===
The company started in 1887, when Albert Heijn, Sr. opened the first Albert Heijn grocery store in Oostzaan, Netherlands. The grocery chain expanded through the first half of the 20th century, and went public in 1948.

Under the leadership of the founder&#x27;s grandsons, Albert Jr. and Gerrit Jan Heijn, the company continued to make a significant impact on food retail in the Netherlands in the next four decades, pioneering self-service shopping, and the development of private labels and of non-food as a grocery store category. The company also influenced culinary development in the country, popularizing products such as wine, sherry and kiwi fruit, contributing to the introduction of the refrigerator in Dutch households and introducing convenience items, such as ready meals and frozen pizzas, to Dutch consumers.

Albert Heijn became the largest grocery chain in the Netherlands during this time, and expanded into liquor stores and health and beauty care stores in the 1970s. In 1973, the holding company Albert Heijn changed its name to &quot;Ahold&quot;, an abbreviation of Albert Heijn Holding&quot;.

===International expansion===
In the 1970s, the company began expanding internationally, acquiring companies in Spain and the United States. Under a new leadership team, which for the first time did not include any members of the Heijn family, the company accelerated its growth through acquisitions in the latter half of the 1990s in Latin America, Central Europe, and Asia.

Ahold N.V. received the designation &quot;Royal&quot; from Dutch Queen Beatrix in 1987, awarded to companies that have operated honorably for one hundred years. That same year Gerrit Jan Heijn, Ahold executive and only brother of Albert Heijn, was kidnapped for ransom and murdered.

===Accounting crisis===
The company&#x27;s ambitious global expansion was halted by the announcement of accounting irregularities at some of Ahold&#x27;s subsidiaries in February 2003. The CEO, Cees van der Hoeven, and CFO, Michael Meurs, and a number of senior management resigned as a result, and earnings over 2001 and 2002 had to be restated. The main accounting irregularities occurred at U.S. Foodservice (now US Foods), and, on a smaller scale, Tops Markets, in the United States, where income related to promotional allowances was overstated. In addition, accounting irregularities were found at the company&#x27;s Argentine subsidiary Disco, and it was determined that the financial results of certain joint ventures had been accounted for improperly.

As a result of the announcements, the company&#x27;s share price plunged by two-thirds, and its credit rating was reduced to BB+ by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s.

===Legal ramifications===
The irregularities led to various investigations and criminal charges by both Dutch and U.S. law enforcement authorities against Ahold and several of its former executives.

Dutch law enforcement authorities filed fraud charges against Ahold, which were settled in September 2004, when Ahold paid a fine of approximately €8 million. Ahold&#x27;s former CEO, CFO, and the former executive in charge of its European activities were charged with fraud by the Dutch authorities. In May 2006, a Dutch appeals court found Ahold&#x27;s former CEO and CFO guilty of false authentication of documents, and they received suspended prison sentences and unconditional fines.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced in October 2004, that it had completed its investigation and reached a final settlement with Ahold.

In January 2006, Ahold announced that it had reached a settlement of US$1.1 billion (€937 million) in a securities class action lawsuit filed against the company in the United States by shareholders and former shareholders. Another class action lawsuit was filed against Ahold&#x27;s auditors, Deloitte, but this suit was dismissed. The suit was brought up again by shareholders in 2007, and by a different shareholder group in 2012.

The SEC filed fraud charges against four former executives of U.S. Foodservice: the company&#x27;s former CFO, former chief marketing officer, and two former purchasing executives. The purchasing executives settled the charges. The former chief marketing officer was sentenced to 46 months in prison. The former CFO was sentenced to six months of home detention and three years&#x27; probation.

===Road to recovery===
Anders Moberg became CEO on 5 May 2003. Under his and other new leadership appointed following the crisis, Ahold launched a &quot;Road to Recovery&quot; strategy in late 2003 to restore its financial health, regain credibility, and strengthen its business.

As part of this strategy, Ahold announced it would divest all operations in markets where it could not achieve a sustainable number one or two position within three to five years, and that could not meet defined profitability and return criteria over time. The company divested all its operations in South America and Asia, retaining a core group of profitable companies in Europe and the United States. As part of its Road to Recovery strategy, Ahold strengthened accountability, controls and corporate governance and restored its financial health, regaining investment grade in 2007.

===Strategy for profitable growth===
In November 2006, Ahold announced the results of a major strategic review of its businesses. As a result of this review, Ahold launched its strategy for profitable growth focused on strengthening its retail competitive position, particularly in the United States. The company focused on building its brands by creating an improved product and service offering, delivered an improved price position and lowered operating costs; and reorganized the company into two continental organizations led by Chief Operating Officers. As part of the strategy, Ahold further focused its portfolio, including the divestment of U.S. Foodservice (completed in July 2007, to CD&amp;R and KKR for US$7.1 billion), Tops (completed in December 2007, for US$310 million to Morgan Stanley Private Equity) and the company&#x27;s operations in Poland (completed in July 2007, to Carrefour). The company made solid progress in delivering its strategy under the leadership of John Rishton, appointed CEO in November 2007, who had been part of the team that developed the strategy in his previous role as CFO.

In November 2011, under the leadership of Dick Boer, appointed CEO in March 2011, Ahold announced a new phase of its growth strategy, &quot;Reshaping Retail&quot;. This strategy has six pillars - three designed to create growth and three to enable this growth. The six pillars are: increasing customer loyalty, broadening our offering, expanding geographic reach, simplicity, responsible retailing, and our people.

===Merger with Delhaize Group===
On 24 June 2015, Delhaize Group reached an agreement with Ahold to merge, forming a new company, Ahold Delhaize. At completion of the merger, Ahold shareholders will own 61% of the new combined company while Delhaize Group shareholders will hold the remaining 39%. Ahold CEO Dick Boer will become CEO of the merged company, with Frans Muller, CEO of Delhaize to become deputy CEO and chief integration officer.

<doc id="735428" wikidata="Q17038697" url="?curid=735428" title="Two-Headed Monster">
<text>The Two-Headed Monster is a comical, light purple Muppet monster on the television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, first appearing in season 9, 1978.

==History==
The Two-Headed Monster, as the name implies, is an example of bicephaly. The right-hand head has purple hair and a black beard, with upturned horns, whereas the left-hand head has black hair and a purple beard, with downturned horns. They have slightly different personalities, with the left-hand head seemingly the more rational and sensible of the two, but also slightly grouchier. Speaking in baby-like gibberish except when emphasizing a word, which is usually enough for them to communicate with others, the monster, in typical sketches, would sound out words in front of a brick wall, then push them together to say the full word, or do something else which involves cooperation. They are presumably dicephalic parapagus twins, as their mother made an appearance in one sketch when they sounded the word &quot;mom&quot;; she has a single head and speaks normally. They share a single pair of arms and legs.

==Inspiration==
The creation of this monster was inspired by performers Jerry Nelson and Richard Hunt playing around on the set one day, saying that they were a monster with two heads. While right-handed performers use their right hands to perform the heads of characters and their left to perform left hands, whoever performs the left half of the monster performs the head with the left hand, and the right hand with their right hand.

==Performers==
The performers for the Two-Headed Monster are listed in order of the history from the Left Head and the Right Head:

* Richard Hunt and Peter Friedman (ca. 1978)
* Jerry Nelson and Richard Hunt (1978–1991)
* Jerry Nelson and Adam Hunt (&quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Word!&quot; PC game, 1995)
* Jerry Nelson and David Rudman (1998–1999)
* Joey Mazzarino and David Rudman (2001–2016)
* Martin P. Robinson and Joey Mazzarino (Episode 4024, 2002)
* Matt Vogel and David Rudman (Episode 4030, 2002)
* Eric Jacobson and David Rudman (2016–present)
* Stephanie D&#x27;Abruzzo and David Rudman (Episode 4733, 2017)

==Design team==
The Two-Headed Monster was designed by Jim Henson and built by Caroly Wilcox.

<doc id="735430" wikidata="Q186885" url="?curid=735430" title="Timestamp">
<text>A timestamp is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. Timestamps do not have to be based on some absolute notion of time, however. They can have any epoch, can be relative to any arbitrary time, such as the power-on time of a system, or to some arbitrary time in the past.

A distinction is sometimes made between the terms datestamp, timestamp and date-timestamp:
* Datestamp or DS: A date, for example 2025--18 according to ISO 8601
* Timestamp or TS: A time of day, for example 00:: using 24-hour clock
* Date-timestamp or DTS: Date and time, for example 2025--18, 00:: 

== History ==

The term &quot;timestamp&quot; derives from rubber stamps used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received. Common examples of this type of timestamp are a postmark on a letter or the &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; times on a time card.

With the advent of digital data systems, the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data. For example, computer files contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and digital cameras add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called &quot;timestamping&quot;.

Timestamps are typically used for logging events or in a sequence of events (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the per-file metadata.
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX stat (system call), so each file has three timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: codice_1),
time of last modification (mtime: codice_2), and
time of last status change (ctime: codice_3).

Some file archivers and some version control software, when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

Timestamps are often found to be dirty in many cases. Without cleaning up inaccurate timestamps, time-related applications such as provenance analysis or pattern queries are not reliable. To evaluate the correctness of timestamps, temporal constraints can be applied, declaring distance limits between timestamps.

==Standardization==
ISO 8601 standardizes the representation of dates and times. These standard representations are often used to construct timestamp values.

== Examples ==

Examples of date-timestamps:
* Thurs 12/31/2009 1:35 p.m. — mixed-endian date, big-endian 12-hour clock
* Thurs 31.12.2009 13:35 — same time as the above, different format with little-endian date and big-endian 24-hour clock
* 2005-10-30 T 10:45 UTC — ISO 8601 international order (big-endian) with time zone)
* 2007-11-09 T 11:20 UTC — same format as the above, hence easy to compare and perform alphanumeric sorting
* Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005
* 2009-10-31T01:48:52Z — ISO 8601
* 2009-10-31 01:48:52Z — &quot;Internet time&quot; per RFC 3339, based on ISO 8601
* 1256953732 — Unix time, equivalent to 2009-10-31 T 01:48:52Z
* 1969-07-21 T 02:56 UTC

<text>Michael Joseph &quot;King&quot; Kelly (December 31, 1857 – November 8, 1894), also commonly known as &quot;$10,000 Kelly&quot;, was an American outfielder, catcher, and manager in various professional American baseball leagues including the National League, International Association, Players&#x27; League, and the American Association. He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career with the Chicago White Stockings and the Boston Beaneaters. Kelly was a player-manager three times in his career – in 1887 for the Beaneaters, in 1890 leading the Boston Reds to the pennant in the only season of the Players&#x27; League&#x27;s existence, and in 1891 for the Cincinnati Kelly&#x27;s Killers – before his retirement in 1893. He is also often credited with helping to popularize various strategies as a player such as the hit and run, the hook slide, and the catcher&#x27;s practice of backing up first base. In 1945, Kelly was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

In concluding where to truly give Kelly credit as an innovator, a 2004 book devoted to 19th-century rule bending in baseball—and which came close to exhaustively accounting for all contemporary reporting on various subjects—placed stress on the following: &quot;Kelly&#x27;s hook slide does sound special, and players probably tried to copy it. Also, he seems to have been the first big leaguer to successfully cut a base (when the usually lone umpire wasn&#x27;t looking), at least according to the newspaper record.&quot; And, &quot;Kelly could have been the first to foul off lots of pitches on purpose. Doing so was a top trick of some Baltimore players of the 1890s. At the turn of the century, that trick was defused when all foul balls began counting as strikes.&quot;

Kelly&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Play Ball: Stories of the Ball Field&quot; was published while he was with the Beaneaters in 1888, the first autobiography by a baseball player; it was ghostwritten by Boston baseball writer John J. &quot;Jack&quot; Drohan. Kelly also became a vaudeville performer during his playing career, first performing in Boston where he would recite the now-famous baseball poem &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;, sometimes butchering it. Kelly&#x27;s baserunning innovations are also the subject of the hit 1889 song entitled &quot;Slide, Kelly, Slide&quot; and a 1927 comedy film of the same name.

==Early life==
Kelly was born in Troy, New York, to Michael Kelly Sr. and his wife Catharine, both Irish immigrants. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, his father joined the Union Army, and Mike likely learned to play baseball while living with his mother and younger brother James in Washington, D.C. After the war, his ill father moved the family to Paterson, New Jersey. Kelly&#x27;s parents apparently died within about five years of each other and he was orphaned by age 18. A best guess, based on tracking Paterson city directories, is that his father died around 1871, and his mother around 1876, when Michael was 18. According to the 1870 census, a Michael Kelly of his age was working in a silk mill in Paterson as of that year.

==Early career==
By 1873, the fifteen-year-old Kelly was good enough to be invited to play baseball on Blondie Purcell&#x27;s amateur team in Paterson, which played teams throughout the New York metro area, including the Brooklyn Atlantics from the National Association. From 1875 to 1877, he played three seasons as a semi-pro: in Paterson and then other cities.

In 1877, he was with the Paterson Olympics until around June 10, when he joined the Delawares of Port Jervis, New York. In mid-July, a Paterson paper said he had signed with a Springfield, Ohio, team after rejecting a Port Jervis offer of $70 a month (). A few weeks later, Port Jervis had not played again when he signed &quot;with the celebrated Buckeye club of Columbus, Ohio.&quot;

He made his big league debut in 1878 with Cincinnati. In 1877, Kelly&#x27;s friend Jim McCormick was signed to play for the Columbus Buckeyes of the International Association, and he recommended that his friend Mike be signed to be his catcher. The year after that, Kelly signed to play for the Cincinnati Reds, then known as the Red Stockings. Although the concept would come later, Mike Kelly was now a major leaguer.

==Career in Chicago==
After playing in Cincinnati for two years as an outfielder and backup catcher, Cincinnati and Chicago White Stockings players went on a tour of California. While there, Chicago secured him for 1880, then-Chicago Secretary Albert Spalding doing the signing. Later from San Francisco, Kelly wrote Spalding, who was back in Chicago, &quot;Cincinnati Club has gone back on us. Please send expenses. Am broke.&quot; Cincinnati had fallen on hard times by 1879 and released all their players at the end of that season to save having to pay them a last paycheck.

As of 1879, Chicago was the most important city financially in the National League, as it drew the best attendance for teams taking long train rides from the East Coast.
Kelly was now a young, good-looking man in the big city with money in his pocket. Rather than buying a house, he immediately moved into the Palmer House, the loudest, brashest, most garish and, according to its literature, &quot;fire-proof&quot; hotel in the world.

As a member of the White Stockings, he was annually among the league leaders in most offensive categories, including leading the league in runs from 1884 through 1886 (120, 124 and 155 respectively), and batting in 1884 and 1886 (.354 and .388). One of the best defensive catchers in baseball, he was also one of the first to use a glove and wear a chest protector. Chicago won five pennants while Kelly played for the White Stockings.

==Career in Boston==

After the 1886 season Spalding sold Kelly to the Boston Beaneaters for a then-record $10,000 (), after Kelly balked at returning to the club. Right before the sale, Chicago writer Happy Palmer quoted Spalding about his plans to manage Kelly: &quot;Oh, tie him up, I guess, if he really is averse to playing here. He may have his ugly up, and I guess from the way he is holding out in his refusal to sign that that is the case. All right, though. I am willing, and if he keeps on in that spirit I&#x27;ll make him eat hay with his horses before he is much older. He has been mad long enough now, and it is pretty near time somebody was getting mad at this end of the line. One thing I can certainly predict and that is that if Mr. Mike Kelly does not sign a contract with Chicago pretty d--d quick, he will have cause to regret it. That is all.&quot;

As a result of the sale, he became known as the &quot;$10,000 Beauty.&quot; In 1881, actress Louise Montague had been so dubbed after winning a $10,000 contest for handsomest woman in the world.

It was in Boston that Mike became &quot;King&quot; Kelly, although he was still overwhelmingly referred to as &quot;Mike&quot; or &quot;The Only&quot; in contemporaneous reporting. As a member of the Beaneaters, he continued to be a key run-producer, scoring 120 runs in 1887 and 1889. He continued to play well and was a great box office draw, but Boston didn&#x27;t win any pennants. Freed from the watchful eye of Spalding and Anson, Kelly became less self-disciplined. One day in 1888, Boston player-manager John Morrill fined him $100 for not reporting to the grounds. After dinner the night before, Kelly had told Morrill he was ill, and Morrill said he should still report. The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; said, &quot;Every man on the team thinks [the $100 fine] was deserved.&quot; The &quot;Herald&quot; also said of Kelly, &quot;At times he goes in and plays with his whole spirit, and he puts life into the team. A sample of that was seen in yesterday&#x27;s game, a game that he won for the Bostons. At other times he plays carelessly and indifferently, puts on a spirit of independence, disobeys Morrill on instructions at will, and does as he pleases.&quot;

Kelly managed and played for the Boston Reds in the year-lived Players&#x27; League in 1890, and the Reds won the only Players&#x27; League title.
During the 1890 season, friends bought him a $10,000 house at South Hingham, Massachusetts, about 15 miles southeast of Boston. Contributors included former umpire John Kelly, the owner of their New York bar; Boston fans Arthur &quot;Hi! Hi!&quot; Dixwell and Frank Norton, and Boston Players&#x27; League President Charles A. Prince and Secretary Julian B. Hart. They contributed $300 each (). Others who gave included John Graham, Jim McCormick, and captains Buck Ewing of New York and John Montgomery Ward of Brooklyn. The house, worth $10,000, could not be mortgaged based on the $1,100 in donations, $400 of which went for a horse and carriage, so in the winter of 1890-91, father-in-law John Headifen &quot;came to the rescue of his (Kelly&#x27;s) [sic] friends and subscribed $1800&quot;, the Boston Record said. The Old Colony Savings Bank in Plymouth then gave a matching $2,500 loan, and with that a mortgage was obtained. When he signed with Boston in August 1891, the club&#x27;s directors gave him a check for $4,300 for &quot;lifting the mortgage on his &#x27;popular subscription&#x27; home.&quot;

The house, stable and land would be put up for sale in the spring of 1893 for unpaid taxes of $123 (). It also had a $2,000 mortgage left at five percent interest. In October 1893, the house would be sold.

In 1898, Boston National League Director William H. Conant would recall having paid, around the time of the 1891 payment, a $200 bar bill for Kelly and friends and being forwarded, on a visit to the bar later that night, another Kelly tab for $140.

==Later career==
In , Kelly returned to Cincinnati as the captain of a newly established American Association club there. The team was generally known as the Reds, but were also often called &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Killers&quot; in the media due to Kelly&#x27;s strong presence. The team was in seventh place when it folded in mid-August, and Kelly signed with the Boston Reds, who had moved to the Association after the Players&#x27; League folded. He spent just four games with the Reds before jumping back across town to the Beaneaters to finish out the season.

After spending the season with the Beaneaters, batting a career-worst .189, his contract was assigned to the New York Giants for . He played just 20 games for the Giants, batting .269 and driving in 15 runs.

Kelly&#x27;s big league career ended after the 1893 season, having compiled 1357 runs, 69 home runs, 950 RBI, and a .308 batting average. Unreliable record-keeping practices of the era prevent an accurate estimate of how many stolen bases Kelly compiled over his career, but statistics kept during his later years indicate he regularly stole 50 or more bases in a season, including a high of 84 in 1887. He also managed to steal six bases in one game.

In 1894, Kelly signed with Albert L. Johnson, the main benefactor of the 1890 Players&#x27; League, to play for his new minor league club in Allentown, Pa. Days before signing him, Johnson had assumed control of the Allentown &amp; Lehigh Valley Traction Company, a trolley line.

In one of the last significant comments about Kelly&#x27;s baseball career, financially, while he was still alive, George W. Floyd said the following to the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; in March 1894:

&quot;Kelly got the worst of it in every deal he made. When he went from the Boston players&#x27; team [in 1890] to the local [association] club [in 1891] he helped that team to make over $100,000 [about $2 million today]. The club at that time was no better than fifth [not sure if that detail is relevant] and his desertion more than anything else gave the finishing blow to the brotherhood [Players&#x27; League]. Mike was popular wherever he played. The trouble with him was that he had no brain as he himself was concerned. He knew enough to make money for others, but never could make anything for himself. I don&#x27;t think that his playing days are over yet, but every club in the league seems inclined to turn him down. Mike has a great many friends in every town where baseball is played and it will be bad policy on the magnates&#x27; [owners&#x27;] part to retire him from the game which he has adorned so long.&quot;

In mid-August 1894, Allentown left the Pennsylvania State League for the Eastern League and moved to Yonkers, N.Y., where Johnson also had a streetcar line. &quot;The parting may be cruel and mercenary--but regrets--well, hardly any. So au revoir, Mike&quot;, the &quot;Allentown City Item&quot; said. Before disbanding, Kelly failed to heed Johnson&#x27;s instructions to release the players. By not releasing them, his old league was able to file a complaint with baseball&#x27;s Board of Control challenging the maneuver. At a meeting in New York, the board ruled that for the next ten days, the Pennsylvania State League could claim Allentown&#x27;s players. Eastern League President Pat Powers said Kelly was to blame &quot;and President A. L. Johnson of the latter club [Allentown], who was also present, voiced the same sentiments&quot;, the New York Sun said.

== Slide, Kelly, Slide! ==

The song, &quot;Slide, Kelly, Slide&quot; was America&#x27;s first &quot;pop hit&quot; record, after its release by Edison Studios, and in 1927 inspired a film version of &quot;Slide, Kelly, Slide&quot;. Prior to that song, most recordings (cylinders), were opera, religious or patriotic in nature. Kelly is also considered to have been the first man to popularize autographing, as fans pursued him on his way to the ballpark for his signature in the 1890s. Prints of a painting of him sliding into second hung in most Irish saloons in Boston, and he was among the first athletes to perform on the vaudeville stage. His own autobiography, &quot;Play Ball&quot;, was the first written by a baseball player. The book was put together by &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reporter John Drohan.

Howard W. Rosenberg&#x27;s 2004 biography of Kelly dispelled any notion that Boston reporter Jake Morse had been the ghostwriter, by quoting Drohan&#x27;s involvement with the book at length, including unearthing the following sentence from a biography of Drohan in an 1889 book about the Irish in Boston: &quot;His only literary work outside of his newspaper was the preparation of M. J. Kelly&#x27;s book, &#x27;Play Ball.&#x27;&quot;

==Vaudeville career==
Kelly took up acting soon after his arrival in Boston. Fellow Boston Elk lodge member and actor Nat Goodwin, a writer said around that time, &quot;repeatedly urged Kelly to abandon his diamond affiliations and embrace the fascinations of stage life, Goodwin claiming that Kelly is a natural born comedian.&quot; Goodwin, a native of Boston, had been a founder of its Elks lodge in 1878. George W. Floyd, Goodwin&#x27;s manager and a native of nearby Quincy, was also a charter member of the lodge and one of its early directors. Floyd was arguably the first player agent in baseball history. For example, in 1892, Floyd told the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; that he had secured Kelly&#x27;s new contract with Boston. It included a percentage of the club&#x27;s earnings above $10,000. Floyd also said, &quot;Kelly is taking the best care of himself and is well fixed. The boodle [his money] is in the shape of gilt-edged securities and &#x27;mammy,&#x27; as Kel affectionately terms his wife, has charge of it.&quot;

In March 1888, Kelly made his regular play debut, as Dusty Bob in Charles H. &quot;Charley&quot; Hoyt&#x27;s &quot;A Rag Baby.&quot; Hoyt had been a Boston baseball writer and was a Boston Elk. A national fraternal group, the Elks were founded in the 1860s and into the mid-twentieth century had close ties to the theatrical profession.

As an example of his later vaudeville career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street. He was billed as &quot;King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field.&quot; His trousers and shirt collar were too big and he buttoned his jacket wrong. Also, his straw hat was a size too small. &quot;It was impossible to look at this vaudeville make-up and not laugh&quot;, the New York Sun said. &quot;Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music at a lot of friends up in the private boxes.&quot; Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner William &quot;Billy&quot; Jerome &quot;took off his hat to him, and introduced him as &#x27;Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.&#x27;&quot; They sang a parody. Later, after reciting &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;, he said, according to the Sun, &quot;I&#x27;m right at home with Casey.&quot; Also, &quot;It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve been in these clothes, and I don&#x27;t quite understand them. Besides I&#x27;ve been over to Guttenberg [a track in New Jersey] to-day, and that is an excuse for anything that a man may do. Come and see me again. I&#x27;m obliged for your welcome.&quot;

In the off-season of 1893-94, Kelly performed with Mark Murphy in &quot;O&#x27;Dowd&#x27;s Neighbors.&quot; Of the first city on the tour, Dover, N.J., Murphy said Kelly called it &quot;the very first town I ever played a game of ball in out [sic] of Patsy!&quot; Patsy, Murphy explained, &quot;is Kellyesque for Paterson.&quot;

==Casey at the Bat==

There is an unsettled debate about whether Kelly was the model for the title character in Ernest Lawrence Thayer&#x27;s 1888 poem &quot;Casey at the Bat.&quot; Thayer, as a baseball reporter for the San Francisco Examiner, had seen Kelly play after the 1887 season, when he was on a playing tour to San Francisco. A &quot;best guess&quot; is to take Thayer at his word that he chose the name &quot;Casey&quot; after a non-player of Irish ancestry he once knew. However, open to debate is who, if anyone, he modeled Casey&#x27;s baseball situations after. Arguably the best big league candidate is Kelly, the most colorful, top player of the day of Irish ancestry. Thayer, in a 1905 letter, singles out Kelly as showing &quot;impudence&quot; in claiming to have written the poem. If he still felt offended, Thayer may have steered later comments away from connecting Kelly to it. Cap Anson 2, the definitive biography of Kelly, states that it did not find Kelly claiming to have been the poem&#x27;s author.

==Controversy and cheating==
Kelly was an adept baserunner, leading the National League in runs scored three times and ranking among the league leaders in stolen bases.

His baserunning was legendary in other ways as well. His arguably most frequent brilliant play was always legitimate—a feetfirst hook slide to avoid being tagged. In 1889, Tim Murnane of the Boston Globe said nine times out of ten, Kelly will &quot;throw himself out of the reach of the baseman, and catch the bag from the outside.&quot; Also, &quot;Kelly is not a sprinter, but can get a great start, and this counts more than a fine slide, as a catcher is likely to be hurried when he sees the runner well on his way to a base.&quot; 

Upon Kelly&#x27;s death, former teammate Tom Brown said, &quot;He originated the slide which I do now in base running, and which is very generally copied by many ball players. The scheme is to slide to the side and get out of the way of the baseman, and not dash into him in the old way. Owing to the success of Kelly&#x27;s sliding the topical song [`Slide, Kelly, Slide!&#x27; by J. W. Kelly, of no relation] was written.&quot;

Kelly also became famous for making unusual plays. He seems to have performed most just a few times and probably made a bigger mark with verbal trickery, while catcher or coacher at first or third base. Right after his death, his longtime captain-manager in Chicago, Cap Anson, said he was a &quot;genius&quot; as a coacher. Apparently referring to Kelly&#x27;s ability to distract opposing fielders, Anson said, &quot;Many a run has been scored through Kelly&#x27;s trickiness. He was a rattling all-around man, but his cleverest work was done behind the plate [while catching]. He was full of tricks and was never so happy as when playing a practical joke.&quot; A year later, Anson said, &quot;Mike Kelly was the prince of base runners. I&#x27;ve never seen a man equal to him in that line, and he could get away with more sharp tricks than any man who ever wore a baseball uniform.&quot;

Kelly&#x27;s uniqueness was in making four attempts to cut bases, while the then-lone umpire wasn&#x27;t looking, in the apparent first prevalent year of the trick: 1881. A methodical study of trickery in early baseball found Kelly cutting bases just a few more times over the rest of his career, and none at other times through 1886, his last year with Chicago. From 1887 to 1893, four seems to be his number of cuts. One was a success. Twice he was called out. Once he went back after being spotted. From 1881 to 1893, the relevant years to compare, dozens of players cut bases.

In his day, a much more common tricky play was fouling off pitches to draw a walk. Until the first years of the twentieth century, batters were generally not charged with a strike for fouling off a pitch. Fouled-off bunts started counting as strikes in 1894, when Kelly&#x27;s big league career was over.

Some of the wildest stories of his trickery were not reported contemporaneously by reporters. Perhaps the most famous play that has been wrongly credited to Kelly—at least as taking place during a game that mattered—is from around 1890. In his 1994 &quot;The Rules of Baseball&quot;, David Nemec relates the following &quot;often-told Kelly tale&quot; and is the rare writer to say it is either false or embellished. As cited in Rosenberg&#x27;s definitive biography of Kelly, Cap Anson 2 (2004), a former teammate of Kelly, Charlie Bennett, said the following after Kelly&#x27;s death in 1894:

Supposedly, Kelly was not in the game when an opposing batter hit a foul fly. Seeing that catcher Charlie Ganzel could not catch the ball, Kelly announced himself in and made the play. The story would have most likely been from 1889, 1891 or 1892, when Ganzel and Kelly were teammates. Bennett said, &quot;During a game one day, [Kelly] sat on the bench and Ganzel was behind the bat [catching]. A foul fly was popped up, out of Ganzel&#x27;s reach, when quick as a flash `Kel&#x27; ran forward, ordered Ganzel out of the game, caught the ball, and then ordered the umpire to declare the batter out. [Kelly] maintained with a great deal of force, that he had as much right to order Ganzel out of the game, while a ball was in the air, as at any other time during the progress of the game. However, the decision went against him.&quot;

Rosenberg could not find a contemporaneous account of Kelly having done that, and it is possible he did so in an exhibition game. The closest sounding story to the above appeared right after Kelly&#x27;s death, when John D. &quot;Johnny&quot; Foster of the &quot;Cleveland Leader&quot; wrote, &quot;The nearest that he ever approached to downright malice in playing in Cleveland was during a game between Cleveland and Boston for the national championship when he called a Cleveland player&#x27;s name as two men were running for a foul fly.&quot;

==Death==

In November 1894, Kelly died of pneumonia in Boston. He had taken a boat there from New York to appear at the Palace Theatre with the London Gaiety Girls. At the start of the final week of his life, an advertisement in Boston read: &quot;Slide, Kelly, Slide. Palace Theatre. The London Gaiety Girls, Chaperoned by King Kelly, the Famous $10,000 Base Ballist.&quot; During the week, his name was deleted when he was too ill to appear. &quot;He caught a slight cold on the boat from New York, but thought little of it&quot;, a writer said upon his death.

During that week in Boston he stayed in the Plymouth House, owned by Bill Anderson, a fellow Elk. Noticing how ill Kelly seemed, Anderson had him rest and called for a doctor. The doctor had him taken to his private room in the hospital. Kelly&#x27;s wife and brother were notified but did not arrive in time to see him alive. Anderson, fellow Elk John Graham and the former secretary of Boston of the Players&#x27; League and the American Association, Julian B. Hart, were with him at the end.

About 7,000 people passed by the open casket. At a benefit for widow Agnes &quot;Aggie&quot; [nee Headifen] a week later, some of the songs performed were &quot;The Irish Queen&quot;, &quot;Nothing is Too Good for the Irish&quot; and &quot;Poor Mick.&quot;

George W. Floyd, a main organizer of the benefit, wired Aggie with news about the proceeds. Days later, he presented a letter to National League owners meeting in New York. Aggie needed money, he said. Right after adjourning a meeting, the owners pledged $1,400 to her ().

Aggie, who never remarried, died in 1937 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. After Mike&#x27;s death, she made her living by sewing, stopping when her eyesight failed. Seventeen months before her death, and her health declining, she was interviewed by the &quot;New Brunswick Sunday Times&quot;. She said Mike to her was &quot;just an overgrown kid&quot; and, in a reporter&#x27;s paraphrase, &quot;always eager to help a young fellow on the field [presumably a teammate], never pugnacious despite his marvelous build of 190 pounds and six feet in height [really 5&#x27;10&quot;], and charitable to the extreme.&quot;

When Kelly was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1945, there were no immediate family members to mark the occasion, as his apparently lone child had died in 1894 – after living only an hour.

She also competed with the CBS team during a 1984 edition of &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;. She made her final screen appearance playing supporting role in the 1999 comedy film &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot;.

McCashin appeared at the TV Land awards in April 2009 for the 30th anniversary celebration of &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. Other &quot;Knots Landing&quot; actors who appeared with her included Kevin Dobson, Lisa Hartman Black, Michele Lee, Donna Mills, Don Murray, Michelle Phillips, Ted Shackelford, and Joan Van Ark.

==New career==
After her Hollywood career, McCashin became a social worker and therapist who specializes in the treatment of eating disorders and body image issues.

==Personal life==

<text>Henry Dilworth Gilpin (April 14, 1801 – January 29, 1860) was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the 14th Attorney General of the United States under President Martin Van Buren from 1840 to 1841. He served as the 2nd Solicitor of the United States Treasury from 1837 to 1840 and U.S. Attorney for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1831 to 1837.

==Early life and education==
Gilpin was the son of Philadelphia-born industrialist Joshua Gilpin and Mary Dilworth, and was born in Lancaster, England, just before his parents returned to America. His father had been on extended tour of Britain and Europe, lasting from 1795 to 1801, during which he obtained information about the new manufacturing methods used in paper-making for his family paper mills on Brandywine Creek in Delaware.

The family returned to England for another stay in 1812 and Gilpin attended school near London. He returned to the United States in about 1816. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1819. He studied law with Joseph R. Ingersoll and was admitted to the bar in 1822.

==Career==
He served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1831 to 1837, and then as Solicitor of the United States Treasury in 1837. During this time he joined the American Philosophical Society (elected in 1832)

From 1833 to 1835 he was on the board of the Bank of the United States. Gilpin supported President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s belief that the bank had become too powerful and worked to ensure that the banks charter was denied which caused the bank to close in 1836. Jackson nominated Gilpin to be the territorial governor of Michigan in 1835 but the confirmation was blocked by Jackson&#x27;s enemies in Congress.

President Martin Van Buren named him 14th Attorney General of the United States in 1840. He served until 1841, during which time he presented the U.S. government&#x27;s side of the &quot;Amistad&quot; case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

From 7 June 1852 until 13 June 1859 he served as president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. He served as vice president and trustee of the Pennsylvania Historical Society and as an associate member of the Massachusetts Historical Society. He served as a director of Girard College from 1856 to 1858 and as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania. He worked as secretary of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.
His position with the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal allowed him to travel throughout the Eastern United States and his writings were later published by his father in a seven volume book titled &quot;Atlantic Souvenirs (1826-1832)&quot;. He contributed articles on politics and literature to several newspapers and journals including the &quot;American Quarterly&quot;, the &quot;Democratic Review&quot; and the &quot;North American Review&quot;. He published several profiles of politicians including Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson and Daniel Webster. Gilpin died in Philadelphia in 1860 and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The Henry D. Gilpin Fund was created by his will for the Chicago Historical Society to establish the Gilpin library.

<text>Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica is a Catholic basilica on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois, which also houses the National Shrine of Saint Peregrine. Located at 3121 West Jackson Boulevard, within the Archdiocese of Chicago, it is, along with St. Hyacinth and Queen of All Saints, one of only three churches in Illinois designated by the Pope with the title of basilica. 

The church is also one of few &quot;Black basilicas&quot; in the United States, having a significant African-American population. Another is the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Norfolk, Virginia.

==History==
Founded in 1874, it has been administered by the Servite fathers for its entire history. Ground was broken for the current building on June 17, 1890, and the church was dedicated on January 5, 1902.

The Parish served an Irish and Italian congregation for many years. The sorrowful mother novena was a major devotion at the parish during the first half of the 20th century, drawing worshippers from across the country and reaching many more listeners by radio. The church also houses the National Shrine of St. Peregrine, the patron of those suffering from cancer.

In the 1960s and 1970s the parish became predominantly African-American.

The basilica was used for a brief scene in the 1987 film &quot;The Untouchables&quot; in which Sean Connery&#x27;s character explains &quot;The Chicago Way&quot; to Kevin Costner&#x27;s character. The basilica also appears in the 1989 film &quot;Next of Kin&quot; in a scene with Patrick Swayze and Helen Hunt, as well as an episode in the 2022 miniseries &quot;The Marian Stained Glass Windows&quot;.

==Architecture==
The church was designed in an Italian Renaissance Revival architectural style by Henry Engelbert, John F. Pope, and William J. Brinkmann. It features a barrel-vaulted ceiling that wraps around a high altar made entirely of Carrara marble. It was declared a basilica by the Vatican in 1956.

==In architecture books==
Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica is featured in a number of books on Chicago architecture, most notably &quot;The AIA Guide to Chicago&quot; by Alice Sinkevitch (Harvest Books 2004).

It is also in a number of books devoted to church architecture, among them:

* &quot;Chicago Churches: A Photographic Essay&quot; by Elizabeth Johnson (Uppercase Books Inc, 1999)
* &quot;Heavenly City: The Architectural Tradition of Catholic Chicago&quot; by Denis R. McNamara (Liturgy Training Publications 2005)
* &quot;The Archdiocese of Chicago: A Journey of Faith&quot; by Edward R. Kantowicz (Booklink 2007)
* &quot;Chicago Churches and Synagogues: An Architectural Pilgrimage&quot; by George A. Lane (Loyola Press 1982)
* &quot;The Spiritual Traveler: Chicago and Illinois: A Guide to Sacred Sites and Peaceful Places&quot; by Marylin Chiat (HiddenSpring 2004).

<text>Sir Peter Alfred Soulsby (born 27 December 1948) is a British Labour Party politician serving as Mayor of Leicester since 2011. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester South from 2005 until he resigned his seat in April 2011, in order to contest the new post of mayor. He served as Leader of Leicester City Council from 1981 to 1994 and from 1996 to 1999.

==Early life==
Soulsby was born on the 27 December 1948 in Bishop Auckland and attended the Minchenden School, a grammar school in Southgate, London. He studied at the City of Leicester College of Education Scraptoft. He gained a BEd from Leicester University in English and Drama. He worked as a teacher at Crown Hills Secondary Modern School and then as a special needs teacher.

==Early political career==
He was first elected to Leicester City Council in June 1973 and served as the Leader of the Council twice, firstly from 1981 to 1994 and secondly from 1996 to 1999. He remained a Labour councillor until he was defeated in the Spinney Hill ward in May 2003.

He unsuccessfully contested the Harborough parliamentary constituency at the 1979 general election. In 1984, he stood for election for the Leicester European Parliamentary constituency, narrowly losing to the Conservative incumbent Fred Tuckman by 1.6%.

==Parliamentary career==

In 2004 he was the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate in the Leicester South by-election; he had been the election agent for the previous MP, Jim Marshall, and like Marshall was not always in agreement with the party&#x27;s policies. Despite his anti-war stance, Soulsby lost by 5.6% to Parmjit Singh Gill of the Liberal Democrats in a by-election which was dominated by the Iraq War and the newly formed left-wing party Respect, which took 12.7% of the vote. In the 2005 general election, less than a year later, he won the seat back for Labour from Gill.

On 31 October 2006, Soulsby was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War. He also rebelled against the government on its proposals to permit the detention of terrorist suspects for 90 days without trial; however, in June 2008, he supported the government on the proposal to extend the detention of terrorist suspects for 42 days. (see Terrorism Act 2006.) He retained his seat in the 2010 general election with a 5% swing from the Liberal Democrats.

In June 2010, he was selected as a Labour member of the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee.

On 5 March 2011, Soulsby was selected as Labour&#x27;s candidate for the new post of Mayor of Leicester. He resigned as MP for Leicester South in order to contest the mayoral election. On 1 April 2011, Soulsby was appointed Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, effecting his resignation from the House of Commons.

==Mayor of Leicester==
Sir Peter Soulsby was elected Mayor of Leicester on 5 May 2011, with a majority of 37,260. He had previously served as Leader of Leicester City Council from 1981 to 1994 and from 1996 to 1999. In August 2011, he claimed to have delivered 99 out of 100 pledges within the first 100 days of office. He said the remaining pledge, on the future of the council offices in New Walk, would be achieved by Christmas. However he was criticised by opposition councillors for not explaining what services would be cut in future.

He has been re-elected as Mayor of Leicester three times, in 2015, 2019, and 2023.

===Salary review===
In November 2011, a salary of £100,000 was recommended by the Mayor&#x27;s remuneration committee—a rise of £44,000, based on the fact that the mayor carried out the work of the city&#x27;s former chief executive, who was paid £175,000. The council was at the time proposing cuts of £70m in services, and the recommendations were criticised by opposing councillors and trade unionists alike. The independence of the committee, which included the vice chancellor of De Montfort University, the head of the chamber of trade and a charity sector worker, was also challenged by the only Conservative councillor &quot;as they worked closely with Sir Peter&quot;. The committee, whose report had been leaked, also recommended a reduction in the number of councillors and the abolition of the post of Lord Mayor. Soulsby dismissed the committee the following day, saying it had made &quot;fundamental costing mistakes&quot; and would have led to &quot;totally unacceptable extra costs&quot;.

In March 2012 Soulsby&#x27;s salary was set at £65,000, at the time comparable to an MP&#x27;s salary.

===Bribery allegation and subsequent court case===
On Thursday 5 May 2016, Mohammed Zameer Khan, a businessman, approached Sir Peter whilst he was outside a city school campaigning for the Labour Party candidate in that day&#x27;s Police and Crime Commissioner election. Soulsby stated afterwards that Khan had tried to bribe him. Soulsby stated that the male patted himself down and said that he wasn&#x27;t recording, then offered him ten per cent of any incentive money if Soulsby allowed him to open a bowling alley at the then disused and derelict Haymarket Theatre. Soulsby returned to his council office and wrote a report on the event, which he handed to council lawyers, who informed the police.

In court, Khan stated that he had patted himself down to apologise as he was wearing pyjamas after dropping his child off at school, denied that he said anything about not recording the discussion and stated that he had said that he would give ten per cent to charity and had not offered it as an incentive to Soulsby. Soulsby stated that charity was not mentioned at any point and described the event as &quot;the most blatant attempt to bribe me in forty years of public life&quot;. The defendant wept in the dock as the jury acquitted him. He said that Soulsby was a celebrity and &quot;hero type&quot; and that he was over-awed by the encounter.

===Christmas Day bus lane fine===
On 25 December 2017, a man who pulled in to a bus stop on Christmas Day to help a homeless man was fined by the council. Lee Williamson said he stopped to give a homeless man a blanket, hat, gloves, scarf, food, and to chat to him. Williamson later received a £70 fine, despite no buses running on 25 December. Leicester City Council said the camera enforcement was an important safety measure. Soulsby confirmed that the penalty would not be enforced, saying, &quot;It was quite clear what Lee was doing was an act of a good Samaritan on Christmas Day and even though it&#x27;s important to keep this safe... there are exceptions.&quot;

===Breach of COVID-19 restrictions===
On 14 June 2020, the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot; newspapers published photographs appearing to show Soulsby breaking rules on movement during a lockdown by visiting his girlfriend during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, the leader of the opposition on the Leicester City Council, Nigel Porter, and local Liberal Democrat and Conservative councillors called for Soulsby to apologise and resign his position. He rejected calls to stand aside and apologised the following day. He was quoted by the BBC as having said &quot;It can be certainly interpreted as being against the spirit of the lockdown, if not against the regulations.&quot;

==Personal life==
He was knighted in 1999 New Year Honours for his services to local government.

He was married to Alison Soulsby, who died of cancer on 10 December 2011, aged 63. He has three daughters and nine grandchildren from his marriage. One of his daughters is Elly Cutkelvin, a councillor for Saffron ward since 2011, whom Soulsby appointed as one of his assistant mayors in 2019.

<text>WJXX (channel 25) is a television station licensed to Orange Park, Florida, United States, serving the Jacksonville area as an affiliate of ABC. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside NBC affiliate WTLV (channel 12). The two stations share studios on East Adams Street (near EverBank Stadium) in downtown Jacksonville; WJXX&#x27;s transmitter is located on Anders Boulevard in the city&#x27;s Killarney Shores section.

Though plans for an Orange Park television station dated to 1977 and the construction permit to 1988, it took upheaval in the city&#x27;s ABC affiliation to induce the construction of channel 25, which began broadcasting in February 1997. The launch was moved two months ahead of schedule after outgoing ABC affiliate WJKS-TV ceased airing more than half of the network&#x27;s prime time lineup. Final transmission facilities were not built out for another seven months, and signal issues alienated viewers in Jacksonville, a market already comparatively weak for the ABC network. Even though the founding owner, Allbritton Communications, built studios and started a local news team, WJXX made little headway in the ratings. The problems caused by the early launch proved insurmountable, leading Allbritton to sell WJXX to Gannett, owner of WTLV, just as common ownership of two stations in a market was permitted. Gannett merged the two stations at WTLV&#x27;s studios in 2000 and began to simulcast nearly all local newscasts under the name &quot;First Coast News&quot;.

==History==
===Early years===
In 1977, a group known as Clay Television, Inc., was formed and petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate channel 25 to Orange Park, a community in Clay County, Florida, south of Jacksonville. The FCC allocated the channel in January 1980, and in October, Clay filed an application for a construction permit to build the proposed station. Principals in Clay Television consisted of Richard Fellows, a former city manager in Green Cove Springs and Orange Park; his son; and three Clay County physicians and their wives. A second application was received for the channel in early 1981 from Orange Park Florida T.V., a company majority-owned by Malcolm Glazer.

In 1982, an FCC administrative law judge refused to grant the construction permit and returned both applications. Clay Television had experienced a cumulative change of 50 percent of ownership, which, per the judge, required refiling; Orange Park Florida T.V. was &quot;basically and technically unqualified&quot; because its antenna site did not meet minimum spacing requirements to other stations. The FCC then permitted Clay to cure the defect on its application, citing uncertainty about processing practices, and ultimately granted a construction permit in October 1982; the former action was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1987 and remanded to the FCC. The FCC reviewed the action in 1988; deeming that continuing the lengthy comparative hearing was not in the public interest as Orange Park had continued to wait for new TV service, it upheld Clay&#x27;s victory. As part of a sequential assignment of television station call signs across the United States in 1989, Clay Television received the call sign WYDP.

The station remained unbuilt due to financial difficulties. In December 1992, after offering WYDP to the Clay County school board, Clay Television filed to sell the construction permit to the University of North Florida. The university proposed to partner with public television station WJCT (channel 7) to build WYDP as a student-run TV station if the Florida Board of Regents would approve the financial outlay.

===ABC upheaval===

On February 16, 1996, Allbritton Communications Company announced it would purchase WBSG-TV (channel 21) in Brunswick, Georgia, north of Jacksonville in Glynn County, for $10.5 million. Allbritton simultaneously announced that its entire station group would either renew their existing ABC affiliations or—in the case of stations in Charleston, South Carolina; in and around Birmingham, Alabama; and WBSG-TV in Brunswick—switch to ABC. At the time, WBSG-TV operated as an affiliate of The WB and also had a news department producing local newscasts covering southeast Georgia, though it was not considered the WB affiliate of record in Jacksonville; the local newscasts had gone on the air with the station in April 1990 and been cut back to early and late evening airings by 1996. Allbritton announced that it would repurpose WBSG-TV as a full-market ABC affiliate for Jacksonville by building a full station facility there. The news blindsided WJKS (channel 17), which had served as the ABC affiliate for the First Coast from 1966 to 1980 and again since 1988. The switch was to occur on January 1, 1997, making the Jacksonville switch among the last in a years-long period of national affiliation realignment that had started in 1994.

However, WBSG-TV&#x27;s transmission facility in Hickox, Georgia, did not provide sufficient coverage of Jacksonville, particularly homes south of Interstate 10. As a consequence, Allbritton filed to erect a new tower in Kingsland, Georgia. WJKS attempted to block this move by making its own application for a tower in Kingsland, though it retracted this request; the FCC rejected WBSG&#x27;s Kingsland proposal, leading Allbritton to instead increase the height and power of the existing WBSG-TV facility, though this did little to expand coverage to the south. By August 1996, when the FCC approved the upgraded Hickox facility, the affiliation switch had been put off until at least February, and WJKS had given up its fight to remain with ABC.
A date of April 1, 1997, was eventually fixed for WBSG-TV to assume the ABC affiliation in Jacksonville. However, those plans changed in January 1997. With little warning, WJKS started extensive preemptions of ABC programs as part of its transition to become Jacksonville&#x27;s affiliate of The WB. Of 22 prime time hours offered by ABC, WJKS refused to clear hours as well as any new programs introduced by ABC. This included all of ABC&#x27;s Sunday and Thursday night programming; the station had already preempted &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; on Monday nights and the Saturday night movie. The schedule change was so abrupt that it came after &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; published its weekly television listings; viewers were told to consult the paper&#x27;s daily program grids instead. Channel 17 continued to broadcast the network&#x27;s five most popular shows, as well as ABC&#x27;s network news and soap operas. The uncleared programs were replaced with syndicated shows and programming from The WB. Even though 70 percent of Jacksonville television households subscribed to cable, those that did not and could not receive WBSG-TV were at risk of losing all access to ABC network programming. The scramble to ensure the First Coast would retain access to ABC programming led ABC and Allbritton to agree to accelerate the switch from April 1 to February.

To make up for WBSG&#x27;s coverage shortfall in the market, Allbritton reached a deal to activate the long-dormant WYDP construction permit, which had been sold in the interim to WRP L.P., under a local marketing agreement. The compressed timetable forced Allbritton to build an interim facility to provide network coverage to Jacksonville, particularly the southern and western portions of the market.

On February 9, 1997, channel 25 came to air under new WJXX call letters. It became the third station in Jacksonville to affiliate with ABC; WTLV had carried the network from 1980 to 1988. Simultaneously, WBSG-TV joined ABC as a semi-satellite of WJXX. For viewers in Georgia dependent on the WBSG-TV transmitter, the switch went well despite reports of &quot;slightly grainy&quot; reception; that station broke off from WJXX&#x27;s feed to continue airing its regional newscasts. Viewers in the Jacksonville area relying on the interim WJXX installation from the final transmitter site, north of Lake Asbury, were greeted with a &quot;patchy&quot; signal; one cable company serving St. Augustine could not get a clean signal to feed to 24,000 subscribers. Even in cable households, picture quality left much to be desired; while its permanent studio was under construction, WJXX sent its signal to cable systems from its transmitters rather than via a direct fiber-optic link. Further problems came when MediaOne, the primary cable provider in Jacksonville, placed WJXX on channel 7 at Allbritton&#x27;s request. However, this caused ingress issues with the over-the-air signal of WJCT on the same frequency; the problem was not alleviated until MediaOne moved the station to channel 5. Even then, WJXX did not provide a direct feed to MediaOne until December. Closed captioning was unavailable, even for ABC network programming, for nearly six months.

In April, Allbritton filed instead to buy WJXX outright while leasing WBSG-TV, paying $5 million for channel 25. The deal was concluded in September.

===A dual construction project===
The rush job of ensuring the partial continuity of ABC programming in the Jacksonville area was completed, leaving Allbritton with three remaining tasks: installing the permanent transmitter facility, constructing local studios, and hiring a news team. The former was finished first, but FCC authorization to activate the new antenna was delayed; pressure by local U.S. representative Tillie Fowler helped WJXX secure FCC authorization for its permanent facility in September, in time for the Jacksonville Jaguars&#x27; first home game on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Even with WJXX at full power, several close-in suburbs such as Atlantic Beach needed cable to watch the station.

Meanwhile, Allbritton acquired a parcel of land on A. C. Skinner Parkway, visible from J. Turner Butler Boulevard, to build a studio facility. The site was designed to accommodate 100 employees, including a news staff of 60 to begin producing local newscasts for the First Coast. In the interim, a 7 p.m. magazine program, &quot;ABC 25 Tonight&quot;, began airing as the station&#x27;s only local program.

On December 15, 1997, &quot;ABC 25 News&quot; debuted from the new studio with hours each weekday of local news programming, most of it simulcast on WBSG-TV. Most of the anchors came from outside the market, having last worked in such markets as Orlando, Boston, and Atlanta; Donna Savarese moved from a job in Hartford, Connecticut, to work at WJXX. In March 1998, WBSG-TV ceased producing full-length 7 and 11 p.m. newscasts, with southeast Georgia news instead provided from Jacksonville as inserts into WJXX&#x27;s newscasts; 11 jobs were lost.

In June 1998, ABC parent The Walt Disney Company entered into negotiations to purchase the eight Allbritton stations and the LMAs with WJXX and WJSU-TV, reportedly offering the company more than $1 billion to acquire them. The sale would have made WJXX the first commercial station in Jacksonville to be an owned-and-operated station of a network. Negotiations between Disney and Allbritton broke down when the former dropped out of discussions to buy the stations the following month.

Allbritton faced a tough task establishing WJXX in the market. Due to the affiliation switch and construction of WJXX being brought forward to prevent ABC from losing much of the Jacksonville market for a two-month period, attention was diverted to the installation of temporary facilities. The seven months of inadequate transmitter coverage of Jacksonville and the even longer stretch without a direct feed to cable providers confused and alienated viewers just as channel 25 needed to make a good first impression. Furthermore, historically, ABC had usually not performed well in the Jacksonville market. In 2003, &quot;Times-Union&quot; television editor Charlie Patton noted that &quot;Jacksonville never acquired the ABC habit&quot;. Total-day ratings trailed the other major network stations in Jacksonville as well as WJKS—which had become WJWB, one of the nation&#x27;s top WB affiliates—though they were on an upswing by the fall 1999–2000 television season. News ratings, despite a product considered superior to that WJKS had produced as an ABC affiliate, lagged longtime Jacksonville news leaders WJXT and WTLV; one bright spot was the market&#x27;s only local newscast at 7 p.m.

===Duopoly with WTLV===
On November 15, 1999, the FCC legalized television station duopolies—the common ownership of two stations in one market. The next day, November 16, the Gannett Company, owner of WTLV, announced it would purchase WJXX from Allbritton. The deal was initiated after Allbritton approached Gannett about a possible sale. The new duopoly rules barred cross-ownership of two of the top four television stations in the same market, a restriction that typically prevented Big Four network affiliates from coming under common ownership. However, WJXX&#x27;s fifth-place finish in total-day ratings, somewhat lower than most ABC affiliates, allowed the deal to go forward.

The news came as a surprise to channel 25&#x27;s employees, who believed Allbritton was committed to building itself up in Jacksonville despite low ratings. It became apparent within a month that WTLV&#x27;s recently expanded facilities and newsroom would form the core of the combined operation and that most of the combined operation&#x27;s staffers would be WTLV holdovers. Staffers started to leave WJXX in sufficient numbers that WJXX&#x27;s general manager, Lewis Robertson, warned that employees from other Allbritton stations might have to be seconded to Jacksonville to maintain station operations in the interim until Gannett took control.
The FCC approved the purchase on March 16, 2000. Gannett took control the next morning, and about 36 WJXX employees—including 13 in news—joined the new combined WTLV operation, which immediately began simulcasting newscasts on both stations before relaunching on April 27 under the umbrella brand of First Coast News. Newscasts continued to be broadcast at the same time on each station, including the WJXX 7 p.m. newscast. 

WBSG-TV was not included, and Allbritton converted it to programming from the Pax network. For a time, this left much of the Georgia side of the market without access to ABC programming; WJXX&#x27;s signal was marginal to nonexistent in that portion even after activating its permanent facility. Some south Georgia cable companies supplemented the market with WJCL in Savannah after Pax network owner Paxson Communications Corporation purchased WBSG-TV later in 2000; that station is now WPXC-TV.

In a post-mortem that ran in the &quot;Times-Union&quot; a month after Gannett bought WJXX, a number of Jacksonville television veterans suggested that many of WJXX&#x27;s problems were of its own making. WJWB general manager Mike Liff claimed Allbritton put too much emphasis on getting channel 25&#x27;s new studios online, saying that a longstanding tenet of the television business called for &quot;focus(ing) on your power, your programs, your promotion, and your people&quot;. He added that Allbritton was in &quot;denial&quot; over its problems for a long time. WJXT general manager Sherry Burns suggested that Allbritton made some &quot;unfortunate missteps&quot; in the early going and appeared to bring WJXX online &quot;before they were ready&quot;. Former WTLV news director Jay Solomon said that WJXX&#x27;s technical snafus hindered its ability to establish itself, despite Allbritton&#x27;s efforts to produce a quality product. He added that channel 25 faced an uphill battle against long-established WJXT and WTLV, especially WJXT, whose primary anchor team had been together for over two decades at the time.

It took nearly two years for Gannett to dispose of the mothballed A. C. Skinner Parkway studio, with its prominent clock tower visible from Butler Boulevard. None of the other major stations in the market needed a new studio at the time. Two attempts to sell the property fell through before a consortium of investors acquired the building in 2002 and leased it to cellular company VoiceStream Wireless.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split into two separate companies, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WJXX and WTLV—along with Gannett&#x27;s other television station properties—were retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

WJXX began broadcasting a digital signal on April 15, 2002. On June 12, 2009, WJXX terminated its analog signal, on UHF channel 25, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 10, using virtual channel 25.

<doc id="735443" wikidata="Q1149279" url="?curid=735443" title="Neumann boundary condition">
<text>In mathematics, the Neumann (or second-type) boundary condition is a type of boundary condition, named after Carl Neumann.
When imposed on an ordinary or a partial differential equation, the condition specifies the values of the derivative applied at the boundary of the domain.

It is possible to describe the problem using other boundary conditions: a Dirichlet boundary condition specifies the values of the solution itself (as opposed to its derivative) on the boundary, whereas the Cauchy boundary condition, mixed boundary condition and Robin boundary condition are all different types of combinations of the Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions.

==Examples==

===ODE===
For an ordinary differential equation, for instance,

:formula_1

the Neumann boundary conditions on the interval take the form

:formula_2

where and are given numbers.

===PDE===

For a partial differential equation, for instance,

:formula_3

where denotes the Laplace operator, the Neumann boundary conditions on a domain take the form

:formula_4

where denotes the (typically exterior) normal to the boundary , and is a given scalar function.

The normal derivative, which shows up on the left side, is defined as

:formula_5

where represents the gradient vector of , is the unit normal, and represents the inner product operator.

It becomes clear that the boundary must be sufficiently smooth such that the normal derivative can exist, since, for example, at corner points on the boundary the normal vector is not well defined.

===Applications===

The following applications involve the use of Neumann boundary conditions:
* In thermodynamics, a prescribed heat flux from a surface would serve as boundary condition. For example, a perfect insulator would have no flux while an electrical component may be dissipating at a known power.
* In magnetostatics, the magnetic field intensity can be prescribed as a boundary condition in order to find the magnetic flux density distribution in a magnet array in space, for example in a permanent magnet motor. Since the problems in magnetostatics involve solving Laplace&#x27;s equation or Poisson&#x27;s equation for the magnetic scalar potential, the boundary condition is a Neumann condition.
* In spatial ecology, a Neumann boundary condition on a reaction–diffusion system, such as Fisher&#x27;s equation, can be interpreted as a reflecting boundary, such that all individuals encountering are reflected back onto .

<doc id="735444" wikidata="Q16151491" url="?curid=735444" title="List of prime ministers of Egypt">
<text>The office of Prime Minister of Egypt was established in 1878, together with the Cabinet of Egypt, after Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha agreed to turn his powers over to a cabinet of ministers modeled after those of Europe. Nubar Pasha was thus the first Prime Minister of Egypt in the modern sense.

Egypt has a long history with a prime minister-type position existing in its governance. Under various Islamic empires, Egypt had Viziers, a political office similar in authority and structure (in terms of being second in command to the head of state) to that of a prime minister. During the Old, Middle, and New Kingdom phases of Ancient Egypt, it was common practice for the Pharaoh to appoint a second in command officer whose position is translated to as Vizier. This pattern of having a prime minister/vizier position in government was only broken for an extended period of time during Roman and Sasanian governance of Egypt, in which Egypt was directly ruled by appointed Governors.

In Arabic, the official term for Prime Minister more directly translates to &#x27;President of the Ministers&#x27;. This is not to be confused with President of Egypt, which is a separate post.

The current Prime Minister of Egypt is Mostafa Madbouly, since 7 June 2018.

<text>Parmjit Singh Gill (born 20 December 1966) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. As Member of Parliament for Leicester South from July 2004 to May 2005, he was the first ethnic-minority Liberal Democrat MP.

He was first elected as Liberal Democrat councillor for Leicester City Council&#x27;s Stoneygate Ward, before being elected to the House of Commons at the Leicester South by-election on 15 July 2004. He contested the seat again at the 2005 general election, but this time came second to the Labour Party candidate, Sir Peter Soulsby. He continued to serve as councillor for Stoneygate Ward until he was defeated in May 2011.

He was initially selected to run as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the 2011 Leicester South by-election after Soulsby stood down to run for mayor for Leicester. However, he stood down after a short time, citing family pressures and was replaced by Zuffar Haq.

He works as a local authority information management and security consultant for Charnwood Borough Council. Prior to that he worked as a data protection administrator for Leicester City Council.

Gill was the Liberal Democrat candidate in the 2023 Leicester mayoral election. He came in third place.

==Personal life==

He is married to Juliet Gill, and the couple have a son and daughter.

<doc id="735452" wikidata="Q1042583" url="?curid=735452" title="McEliece cryptosystem">
<text>In cryptography, the McEliece cryptosystem is an asymmetric encryption algorithm developed in 1978 by Robert McEliece. It was the first such scheme to use randomization in the encryption process. The algorithm has never gained much acceptance in the cryptographic community, but is a candidate for &quot;post-quantum cryptography&quot;, as it is immune to attacks using Shor&#x27;s algorithm and – more generally – measuring coset states using Fourier sampling.

The algorithm is based on the hardness of decoding a general linear code (which is known to be NP-hard). For a description of the private key, an error-correcting code is selected for which an efficient decoding algorithm is known, and that is able to correct formula_1 errors. The original algorithm uses binary Goppa codes (subfield codes of algebraic geometry codes of a genus-0 curve over finite fields of characteristic 2); these codes can be efficiently decoded, thanks to an algorithm due to Patterson. The public key is derived from the private key by disguising the selected code as a general linear code. For this, the code&#x27;s generator matrix formula_2 is perturbated by two randomly selected invertible matrices formula_3 and formula_4 (see below).

Variants of this cryptosystem exist, using different types of codes. Most of them were proven less secure; they were broken by structural decoding.

McEliece with Goppa codes has resisted cryptanalysis so far. The most effective attacks known use information-set decoding algorithms. A 2008 paper describes both an attack and a fix. Another paper shows that for quantum computing, key sizes must be increased by a factor of four due to improvements in information set decoding.

The McEliece cryptosystem has some advantages over, for example, RSA. The encryption and decryption are faster. For a long time, it was thought that McEliece could not be used to produce signatures. However, a signature scheme can be constructed based on the Niederreiter scheme, the dual variant of the McEliece scheme. One of the main disadvantages of McEliece is that the private and public keys are large matrices. For a standard selection of parameters, the public key is 512 kilobits long.

== Scheme definition ==
McEliece consists of three algorithms: a probabilistic key generation algorithm that produces a public and a private key, a probabilistic encryption algorithm, and a deterministic decryption algorithm.

All users in a McEliece deployment share a set of common security parameters: formula_5.

=== Key generation ===

The principle is that Alice chooses a linear code formula_6 from some family of codes for which she knows an efficient decoding algorithm, and to make formula_6 public knowledge but keep the decoding algorithm secret. Such a decoding algorithm requires not just knowing formula_6, in the sense of knowing an arbitrary generator matrix, but requires one to know the parameters used when specifying formula_6 in the chosen family of codes. For instance, for binary Goppa codes, this information would be the Goppa polynomial and the code locators. Therefore, Alice may publish a suitably obfuscated generator matrix of formula_6.

More specifically, the steps are as follows:
# Alice selects a binary formula_11-linear code formula_6 capable of (efficiently) correcting formula_1 errors from some large family of codes, e.g. binary Goppa codes. This choice should give rise to an efficient decoding algorithm formula_14. Let also formula_2 be any generator matrix for formula_6. Any linear code has many generator matrices, but often there is a natural choice for this family of codes. Knowing this would reveal formula_14 so it should be kept secret.
# Alice selects a random formula_18 binary non-singular matrix formula_3.
# Alice selects a random formula_20 permutation matrix formula_4.
# Alice computes the formula_22 matrix formula_23.
# Alice&#x27;s public key is formula_24; her private key is formula_25. Note that formula_14 could be encoded and stored as the parameters used for selecting formula_6.

=== Message encryption ===

Suppose Bob wishes to send a message &quot;m&quot; to Alice whose public key is formula_24:
# Bob encodes the message formula_29 as a binary string of length formula_30.
# Bob computes the vector formula_31.
# Bob generates a random formula_32-bit vector formula_33 containing exactly formula_1 ones (a vector of length formula_32 and weight formula_1)
# Bob sends Alice the ciphertext computed as formula_37.

=== Message decryption ===
Upon receipt of formula_38, Alice performs the following steps to decrypt the message:
# Alice computes the inverse of formula_4 (i.e. formula_40).
# Alice computes formula_41.
# Alice uses the decoding algorithm formula_14 to decode formula_43 to formula_44.
# Alice computes formula_45.

== Proof of message decryption ==
Note that formula_46,
and that formula_4 is a permutation matrix, thus formula_48 has weight formula_1.

The Goppa code formula_2 can correct up to formula_1 errors, and the word formula_52 is at distance at most formula_1 from formula_54. Therefore, the correct code word formula_55 is obtained.

Multiplying with the inverse of formula_3 gives formula_57, which is the plain text message.

== Key sizes ==
Because there is a free choice in the matrix formula_3, it is common to express formula_59 in &quot;systematic form&quot; so that the last formula_30 columns correspond to the identity matrix formula_61. This reduces the key size to formula_62. McEliece originally suggested security parameter sizes of formula_63, resulting in a public key size of . Recent analysis suggests parameter sizes of formula_64 for 80 bits of security when using standard algebraic decoding, or formula_65 when using list decoding for the Goppa code, giving rise to public key sizes of and respectively. For resiliency against quantum computers, sizes of formula_66 with Goppa code were proposed, giving the size of public key of . In its round 3 submission to the NIST post quantum standardization the highest level of security, level 5 is given for parameter sets 6688128, 6960119, and 8192128. The parameters are formula_67, formula_68, formula_69 respectively.

== Attacks ==
An attack consists of an adversary, who knows the public key formula_24 but not the private key, deducing the plaintext from some intercepted ciphertext formula_71. Such attempts should be infeasible.

There are two main branches of attacks for McEliece:

=== Brute-force / unstructured attacks ===
The attacker knows formula_72, the generator matrix of an formula_73 code formula_74 that is combinatorially able to correct formula_1 errors.
The attacker may ignore the fact that formula_74 is really the obfuscation of a structured code chosen from a specific family, and instead just use an algorithm for decoding with any linear code. Several such algorithms exist, such as going through each codeword of the code, syndrome decoding, or information set decoding.

Decoding a general linear code, however, is known to be NP-hard, however, and all of the above-mentioned methods have exponential running time.

In 2008, Bernstein, Lange, and Peters described a practical attack on the original McEliece cryptosystem, using the information set decoding method by Stern.
Using the parameters originally suggested by McEliece, the attack could be carried out in 260.55 bit operations. Since the attack is embarrassingly parallel (no communication between nodes is necessary), it can be carried out in days on modest computer clusters.

=== Structural attacks ===

The attacker may instead attempt to recover the &quot;structure&quot; of formula_6, thereby recovering the efficient decoding algorithm formula_14 or another sufficiently strong, efficient decoding algorithm.

The family of codes from which formula_6 is chosen completely determines whether this is possible for the attacker. Many code families have been proposed for McEliece, and most of them have been completely &quot;broken&quot; in the sense that attacks have been found that recover an efficient decoding algorithm, such as Reed-Solomon codes.

The originally proposed binary Goppa codes remain one of the few suggested families of codes that have largely resisted attempts at devising structural attacks.

<text>Tozeur (; ) is a city in southwest Tunisia. The city is located northwest of Chott el Djerid, in between this Chott and the smaller Chott el Gharsa. It is the capital of Tozeur Governorate. It was the site of the ancient city and former bishopric Tusuros, which remains a Latin Catholic titular see.

== History ==

During the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire and in the Vandal Kingdom, Tozeur was the site of Tusuros, in the Roman province of Byzacena (originally part of Africa Proconsularis).

=== Bishopric ===
At this time it was the seat of a suffragan bishopric, called &quot;Tusuros&quot;.

Located in the Sahel hinterland of the Byzacena coastline, close to the towns of Aquae and Nefta and south of Capsa and Ad Turres, Roman Tursuros became an important center of Donatism.

The bishopric ceased to function following the seventh-century arrival of Islam. The remains of an ancient church are visible in the foundations of an old mosque of Tozeur.

Four bishops (two canonical, two schismatic Donatist heretics) are historically documented
*Bennatus, partook in the Council of Cabarsussi, held in 393 by Maximianists, a sect of dissident Donatists, and signed their acts.
* Asellicus, 4th-century bishop, known from correspondence with Augustine of Hippo and Donatian of Reims and from tracts against one Aptus who was accused of Judaising. He attended the Council of Carthage (411) where the prevailing Catholics condemned Donatism as heresy.
* Florentinus participated in the Council of Carthage called in 484 by the Arian king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, whereafter he was exiled like most Catholic bishops, unlike Aptus, Asellicus&#x27; Donatist rival.

=== Roman role ===
=== Arab role ===

After the Umayyad conquest of North Africa in the late 6th century and early 7th century, the city became part of the Umayyad Caliphate, and later the Abbasid Caliphate.

Al-Tijani described Tozeur in the 14th century:&quot;Tozeur is the capital of the Djerid region, and there is no forest in the Jarid lands larger than it or with more abundant water. Its water originates from springs that emerge from the sand, gathering outside the town in a wide valley, from which numerous streams branch off. Each stream further divides into channels that the inhabitants distribute among themselves according to established ownership divisions, with known shares of water. They have appointed trustworthy officials from among their righteous men to oversee the distribution, allocating the water by the hours of day and night according to a well-known and established system. [..] Many of its people reside in its palm grove, and there is a stark contrast between the buildings within the grove and those inside the town. The structures in the grove are larger and more refined. Inside the town, there are two mosques for Friday prayers and a single bathhouse. Their main gathering place for leisure is at a location they call &quot;Bab al-Manshar&quot;, which is among the most beautiful spots for recreation because it is where the waters converge.&quot;

== Titular see ==
It was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin titular bishopric of Tusuros (Latin) / Tusuro (Curiate Italian) / Tusuritan(us) (Latin adjective) of the Roman Catholic Church.

It has had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank: 
# Joseph Leo Cardijn (born in Belgium) (15 February 1925 – 22 February 1965), Founder of the international Young Christian Workers (CAJ) then without prelature; later created Cardinal-Deacon of (25 February 1965 – 25 July 1967, his death);
# Giovanni Benelli (11 June 1966 – 3 June 1977) as papal diplomat: Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Senegal (11 June 1966 – 29 June 1967), Apostolic Delegate to Western Africa (11 June 1966 – 29 June 1967) and Roman Curia official: Substitute for General Affairs of Secretariat of State (29 June 1967 – 3 June 1977); later Metropolitan Archbishop of Florence (Italy) (3 June 1977 – 26 October 1982), created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca (27 June 1977 – 26 October 1982, his death);
# Thomas Cajetan Kelly (12 June 1977 – 28 December 1981) as Auxiliary bishop of Archdiocese of Washington (D.C.. United States) (12 June 1977 – 28 December 1981); later Metropolitan Archbishop of Louisville (United States) (28 December 1981 – 12 June 2007, his retirement), died in 2011;
# Paul Lanneau (14 February 1982 – 26 January 2017, his death), first as Auxiliary Bishop of Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels (Belgium) (14 February 1982 – 20 March 2002), then as emeritus;
# Bishop-elect Amilton Manoel da Silva, Passionists (C.P.) (7 June 2017 – present) as Auxiliary Bishop of Archdiocese of Curitiba (Brazil).

== Geography ==
===Climate===
Tozeur has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) typical of the northern edge of the Sahara. The annual average rainfall is , and the annual mean temperature (day and night) is , making the city both hot and dry year-round. The weather is usually settled and sunny throughout the year. Summers are extremely hot, with daily highs often exceeding in the shade, and the sirocco may push temperatures close to . During winters, it can sometimes freeze at night and just before the sunrise, as the temperature may drop below .

== Modern town ==
With hundreds of thousands of palm trees, Tozeur is a large oasis. Dates are exported from Tozeur. In ancient times, before the advent of motorized vehicles, the oasis was important for the transportation through the Sahara, which took place in caravans. The name of the city in antiquity was Tusuros, it was an important Roman outpost. The medina (old city) of Tozeur, contains traditional architecture, fashion and workmanship.

=== Architecture ===
Tozeur, in common with the surrounding Jerid region, is noted for its yellow/brownish brickwork as well as its patterns in geometric designs which form the facades of most buildings in the old city and the new tourist zone.

The old town of Ouled El Hadef (also known as &quot;Medina of Tozeur&quot;) is an example of the local brickwork which is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Tozeur and was a home for Jews too.

== Sport ==
Tozeur has a football club who plays in the First Professional Federation of Football in Tunisia, the team is called LPS Tozeur. In 2010–2011 season the club almost made it to the First Professional Federation of Football.

== Economy ==
===Overview===
Although still the largest part of the local economy, dates and farming are becoming less appealing to the young, who are more often employed in tourism. Tourism is heavily developed and promoted, and Tozeur is considered a center of &quot;desert tourism&quot; (). The annual &quot;International Festival of Oases&quot; () takes place in the town in November and December each year.

The government initiated two large-scale projects:
# Tapping of deep aquifers by wells. This led to the depletion of most natural springs and abandonment of the traditional irrigation canals. Tozeur&#x27;s oasis has been irrigated based on an open surface canal system designed in the 13th century by engineer Ibn Chabbat. This traditional irrigation system is currently being replaced by a system of concrete pipes. Water that was traditionally free to farmers is now being sold to offset the cost of these projects and pipes.
# The second part of these local projects is the initiation of new oases around town. These oases&#x27; productivity is very low and their future highly unstable. This situation is slowly leading to the decay of the old oases (due to salinity, poor planning and lack of skilled workers) with productivity plummeting and the health and future of the oases questionable.
The region around Tozeur is seeing a large influx of unemployed workers and their families from the once rich phosphate region of Metlaoui, Gafsa and Om Laarayes in hope of work in the tourism sector. The phosphate mines are no longer productive and thousands of workers were laid off after the government sold them to European investors.

Overall the region, and Tozeur in particular, is going through a tough time. The region is embracing the unstable tourism economy and shying away from its traditional agricultural based economy. During the first Gulf War the sector suffered with a loss of large number of workers and an increase in unemployment. The same happened during 11 September 2001 attacks and the Iraq War. 
=== Transport ===

The city is served by buses, taxis, railway, louage (shared or group taxi), and Tozeur–Nefta International Airport with national and international services from London, Paris, Rome and few other European countries (international flight services are mostly during the summer tourism season). Tozeur lies on the edge of the Sahara desert. Tourism activity is higher in the fall and winter months with Douz Festival among others in late December

== People from Tozeur ==

* Aboul-Qacem Echebbi () (Tozeur, February 1909 – 9 October 1934), was a Tunisian poet. The current Tunisian anthem is based on one of his poems.
* Abu Yazid Makhlad ibn Kayrad (), from the Berber Zenata tribe, nicknamed Sahib al-Himar (), who led a mostly Berber revolution against the Fatimid ruler al-Qa&#x27;im. The revolution, almost a success, was finally crushed by the caliph al-Mansur bi-Nasr Allah.
* Ibn Chabbat (), also known as Mohamed Ben Ali Ben Mohamed Ben Ali, (16 October 1221 – 17 June 1285 in Tozeur), was a writer, historian, engineer and respected Tunisian social figure in the 13th century. Ibn Chabbat&#x27;s main contribution and legacy is an open surface canal system for equitable water distribution in the oasis that is still in use today.
* Ibn al-Kardabūs (13th century), jurist and historian of al-Andalus
* Brahim Dargouthi (born 1955), novelist. &quot;Nafta&quot;, a city located in the governorate of Tozeur, formerly, was known as the cradle of knowledge in North Africa. It is the &quot;Koufa&quot; of Africa.

== Popular culture ==

Tozeur was used as a filming location for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (specifically Sidi Bouhlel canyon outside the town and the salt-flats of nearby Nefta). Lucasfilm also built an entire set a few kilometers north-west of Tozeur in the middle of the desert. This set acted as Mos Espa in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. The buildings are still there and can be visited.
&quot;The English Patient&quot; (9 Oscars) with Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was partially filmed outside Tozeur.

In May 1984 the Italian singers Alice and Franco Battiato represented Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;I treni di Tozeur&quot; (&quot;The Trains of Tozeur&quot;), whose lyrics contain several references to Tozeur, the historic train &quot;Le Lézard rouge&quot; and Tunisian history in general. This song became a chart hit throughout Continental Europe and Scandinavia.

<text>Caribbean South America is a subregion of South America that borders the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the Caribbean region of Colombia and the Venezuelan Caribbean. 

Significant cities and metropolitan areas with populations over 250,000 on South America&#x27;s Caribbean coast include, from west to east: Cartagena (914,552), Barranquilla (2,370,753 metropolitan area), Santa Marta (499,192 district), Maracaibo (5,278,448 metropolitan area), Caracas (8,956,813 metropolitan area), Barcelona (815,141), Puerto La Cruz (454,312), and Cumaná (405,626).

By extension, The Guianas, while not bordering the Caribbean Sea directly, are commonly reckoned with this region, as well, on account of their close ties with Caribbean countries, e.g. through membership in the Caribbean Community.

<text>The Archdiocese of Chicago () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical jurisdiction, an archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church located in Northeastern Illinois, in the United States. The Vatican erected it as a diocese in 1843 and elevated it to an archdiocese in 1880. Chicago is the see city for the archdiocese.

As of January 2025, Cardinal Blase Joseph Cupich is the archbishop of Chicago. The cathedral parish for the archdiocese, Holy Name Cathedral, is in the Near North Side area of Chicago.

The archdiocese serves over 2 million Catholics in Cook and Lake counties, an area of . The archdiocese is divided into six vicariates and 31 deaneries. An episcopal vicar administers each vicariate. The archdiocese is the metropolitan see of the province of Chicago. Its suffragan dioceses are the other Catholic dioceses in Illinois: Belleville, Joliet, Peoria, Rockford, and Springfield.

Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, archbishop of Chicago from 1982 to 1996, was arguably one of the most prominent figures in the American Catholic church in the post-Vatican II era, rallying progressives with his &quot;seamless garment ethic&quot; and his ecumenical initiatives.

==History==
===1600 to 1800===
The first Catholic presence in present-day Illinois was that of a French Jesuit missionary, Reverend Jacques Marquette, who landed at the mouth of the Chicago River on December 4, 1674. A cabin he built for the winter became the first European settlement in the area. Marquette published his survey of the new territories and soon more French missionaries and settlers arrived.

In 1696, a French Jesuit, Reverend Jacques Gravier, founded the Illinois mission among the Illinois, Miami, Kaskaskia and others of the Illiniwek confederacy in the Mississippi River and Illinois River valleys. During this period, the French-Canadian and Native American Catholics in the region were under the jurisdiction of the bishop of the Diocese of Quebec in New France.

With the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, the British took control of Illinois. Their rule ended after the American Revolution in 1783 when the British ceded Illinois and other Midwestern territories to the new United States. In 1795, the Potawatomi nation signed the Treaty of Greenville that ended the Northwest Indian War, ceding to the United States its land at the mouth of the Chicago River.

=== 1800 to 1840 ===

In 1804, Pope Pius VI erected the Diocese of Baltimore, covering the entire United States. In 1822, Alexander Beaubien became the first person to be baptized as a Catholic in Chicago. By 1826, the Vatican had created the Diocese of St. Louis, covering Illinois and other areas of the American Midwest.

In 1833, Jesuit missionaries in Chicago wrote to Bishop Joseph Rosati of St. Louis, pleading for a priest to serve the 100 Catholics in the city. In response, Rosati appointed Reverend John Saint Cyr. a French priest, as the first resident priest in Chicago. Saint Cyr celebrated his first mass in a log cabin on Lake Street in 1833. At a cost of $400, Saint Cyr constructed St. Mary, a small wooden church near Lake and State Streets. The first Catholic church in the city, it was dedicated in 1833. The next year, Bishop Simon Bruté of the new Diocese of Vincennes in Indiana, visited Chicago. He found only one priest serving over 400  Catholics. Brulé asked permission from Rosati to send several priests from Vincennes to Chicago.

In 1837, Saint Cyr retired as pastor of St. Mary and was replaced by Reverend James O&#x27;Meara. He moved St. Mary to another wooden structure at Wabash Avenue and Madison Street. When O&#x27;Meara left Chicago, Saint Palais demolished the wooden church and replaced it with a brick structure.

===1840 to 1850===
Pope Gregory XVI erected the Diocese of Chicago on November 28, 1843. It included all of the State of Illinois, taking territory from the Dioceses of St. Louis and Vincennes. In 1844, Gregory XVI named Reverend William Quarter of Ireland as the first bishop of Chicago. On his arrival in Chicago, Quarter summoned a synod of the 32 priests to begin the organization of the diocese.

Quarter secured the passage of a state law in 1845 that declared the bishop of Chicago an incorporated entity, giving him the power to hold real estate and other property in trust for religious purposes. This law would allow Quarter and future prelates to construct churches, colleges, and universities in the archdiocese.

Quarter invited the Sisters of Mercy to come to Chicago in 1846. Over the next six years, the sisters founded schools, two orphanages and an academy. One of their projects was the St. Xavier Female Seminary, a secondary school that attracted students from wealthy Catholic and Protestant families. St. Mary of the Lake University, the first university or college in Chicago, opened in 1846. Quarter died on April 10, 1848.

On October 3, 1848, Pope Pius IX appointed Reverend James Van de Velde of the Society of Jesus as the second bishop of Chicago. During his brief tenure in Chicago, Van de Velde built two elementary schools, a night school for adults, an employment office, and a boarding house for working women. After the 1849 cholera outbreak in Chicago, he established residences for the many children orphaned by the epidemic.

=== 1850 to 1860 ===

Van De Velde opened the Illinois Hospital of the Lakes in 1851, the first hospital in Chicago. Suffering from severe rheumatism during the harsh Chicago winters, Van De Velde persuaded the pope in 1852 to appoint him as bishop of the Diocese of Natchez in Mississippi. The Vatican erected the Diocese of Quincy in 1853, taking Southern Illinois from the Diocese of Chicago. The Diocese of Quincy later became the Diocese of Alton and then the Diocese of Springfield in Illinois.

In December 1853, Reverend Anthony O&#x27;Regan was appointed as the third bishop of Chicago by Pius IX. During his tenure, O&#x27;Regan purchased property for the construction of several churches and Calvary Cemetery in Chicago. A systematic administrator and strong disciplinarian, O&#x27;Regan generated significant dissatisfaction among his clergy. Many French-speaking congregants accused him of stealing their property. In 1855, the Sisters of the Holy Cross founded an industrial school in Chicago for girls, both Catholic and non-Catholic.

Frustrated by the opposition he faced in the diocese, O&#x27;Regan submitted his resignation in 1857 to the Vatican, which accepted it in June 1858. The pope appointed Bishop James Duggan of St. Louis as the apostolic administrator of the diocese.

On January 21, 1859, Pius IX named Duggan as the fourth bishop of Chicago. Duggan faced challenges in Chicago: the legacy of the decade-long lack of leadership in the diocese, the aftereffects of the financial panic of 1857, and of the American Civil War. German Catholics were hostile to an Irish bishop. Irish-born priests were hostile to Dugan&#x27;s stand against the Fenian Brotherhood: he denied the sacraments to anyone tied to this secret society. Some clergy faulted Duggan for failing to support the University of St. Mary of the Lake, which closed in 1866 due to financial problems and low enrollment. In 1859, Dugan founded the House of the Good Shepherd in Chicago as a residence for &quot;delinquent women&quot;.

=== 1860 to 1880 ===

After Duggan returned from the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1866, he began to exhibit sign of mental instability. When he left Chicago for a European trip, several diocesan priests wrote to the Vatican, questioning Dugan&#x27;s mental health. Three years later, in 1869, Pius IX sent Duggan to a sanitarium in St. Louis and appointed Monsignor Thomas Foley as coadjutor bishop to operate the diocese. In 1870, a Jesuit educator, Reverend Arnold Damen, established St. Ignatius College in Chicago.

In October 1871, the diocese suffered nearly a million dollars in property damage in the Great Chicago Fire, including the destruction of St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1875, Foley dedicated the new Cathedral of the Holy Name in Chicago, designed by architect Patrick Keely. Foley invited the Franciscans, Vincentians, Servites, Viatorians, and Resurrectionist religious orders to establish parishes and schools in the diocese. In 1876, disagreements between Foley and Mother Mary Alfred Moes of the Sisters of St. Francis of Mary Immaculate of Joliet led her to relocate her order to Minnesota.

In 1877, the Vatican erected the Diocese of Peoria, taking several counties in Central Illinois from the Diocese of Chicago. Foley died in 1879,

=== 1880 to 1900 ===

In 1880, the Vatican elevated the Diocese of Chicago to the Archdiocese of Chicago. At that time, it transferred five more counties to the Diocese of Peoria. Pope Leo XIII named Bishop Patrick Feehan from the Diocese of Nashville as the first archbishop.

From 1880 to 1902, the Catholic population of Chicago nearly quadrupled to 800,000, mainly due to immigration. While the existing Irish and German communities expanded, Polish, Bohemian, French-Canadian, Lithuanian, Italian, Croatian, Slovak and Dutch Catholics arrived in the archdiocese, bringing their own languages and cultural traditions.

During his tenure as archbishop, Feehan founded 140 new parishes. Fifty-two of them were national parishes serving particular ethnic communities, staffed by religious orders from their home countries. The parishes provided the new immigrants with familiar fraternal organizations, music, and language, safe from xenophobia and anti-Catholic discrimination.

In 1881, Feehan established the St. Vincent Orphan Asylum and in 1883 the St. Mary&#x27;s Training School for Boys. They were followed in 1887 with the founding of St. Paul&#x27;s Home for Working Boys. A strong supporter of Catholic education, Feehan promoted it with an exhibition at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago &quot;Archbishop Feehan believed a strong system of Catholic education would solve the problem of inconsistent religious instruction at home, and unify a rapidly diversifying Catholic America.&quot; He also brought the Vincentians to Chicago to start what is now DePaul University.

=== 1900 to 1930 ===
After Feehan died in 1902, Leo XIII in 1903 named Bishop James Quigley from the Diocese of Buffalo as the next archbishop of Chicago. In 1905, Quigley asked Reverend John De Schryver, a professor at St. Ignatius College Prep in Chicago, to organize St. John Berchmans Parish for Belgian Catholics. Quigley also established parishes for Italian and Lithuanian immigrants. &quot;Chicago&#x27;s urban parishes flourished as an important spiritual, cultural, and educational component of Chicago&#x27;s life.&quot;

Pope Pius X erected the Diocese of Rockford in 1907, with 12 counties transferred from the Archdiocese of Chicago. In 1910, Quigley approached Reverend Francis X. McCabe, president of DePaul University, about the lack of higher education opportunities for Catholic women in the archdiocese. DePaul began admitting women the following year. Quigley died in 1915.

The next archbishop of Chicago was Auxiliary Bishop George Mundelein from the Diocese of Brooklyn, appointed by Pope Benedict XV on December 9, 1915. Almost half the Chicago population was Catholic by the 1920s. For decades, the parishes had been building and running their own schools, employing religious sisters as inexpensive teachers. The languages of instruction were often German or Polish. On taking office, Mundelein centralized control of the parish schools. The archdiocesan building committee now picked the locations for new schools while its school board standardized the school curricula, textbooks, teacher training, testing, and educational policies.

In 1926, the archdiocese hosted the 28th International Eucharistic Congress.

=== 1930 to 1960 ===

Mundelein died in 1939. To replace him, Pope Pius XII named Archbishop Samuel Stritch from the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. After Stritch died in May 1958, Pius Xll appointed Archbishop Albert Meyer of Milwaukee as archbishop of Chicago on September 19, 1958.

Pius XII erected the Diocese of Joliet in 1948, taking four counties from the Archdiocese of Chicago along with counties from the Dioceses of Rockford and Peoria. This created the current territory of the archdiocese.

On December 1, 1958, a fire at Our Lady of the Angels School in Chicago destroyed part of the school and killed 92 students and three nuns. While visiting survivors in the hospital and viewing the deceased in the city morgue, Meyer was overcome with grief. In 1959, the National Fire Protection Association report on the fire criticized the archdiocese for &quot;housing their children in fire traps&quot;. The report noted that the archdiocese continued to operate schools with inadequate fire safety standards. The archdiocese faced $44 million in lawsuits from the families of fire victims and survivors. After six years of negotiations, Meyer agreed to a financial settlement with the victims and survivors.

=== 1960 to 1980 ===

In 1960, Meyer banned parishes from hosting bingo games in response to reports of corruption. In January 1961, during riots in the African-American Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago, Meyer made this statement:We must remove from the church on the local scene any possible taint of racial discrimination or racial segregation, and help provide the moral leadership for eliminating racial discrimination from the whole community. After Meyer died in 1965. Pope Paul VI appointed Archbishop John Cody from the Archdiocese of New Orleans as the next archbishop of Chicago. During his tenure in Chicago, many priests and lay people criticized Cody for an autocratic management style. The Association of Chicago Priests censured Meyer in 1971 for failing to advance the Second Vatican Council reforms in the archdiocese. Cody closed 27 schools as well as several parishes in inner city Chicago.

=== 1980 to 1990 ===

In September 1981, the US Attorney&#x27;s Office in Chicago announced an investigation of Cody over the diversion of over $1 million archdiocesan funds to Helen Dolan Wilson, whom Cody described as his step-cousin. That same week, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; revealed that Wilson was on the archdiocesan payroll, but had no discernable duties. Cody denied all charges of wrongdoing. When Cody died in 1982, the official investigation was terminated.

Pope John Paul II in 1982 chose Archbishop Joseph Bernardin of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati as Cody&#x27;s replacement. Bernardin found an archdiocese in disarray, its priests disheartened by arbitrary administration and charges of financial misconduct under Cody. &quot;With his patient charm and willingness to listen, Bernardin won back the confidence of the clergy and the laity.&quot; Within a few months of his arrival in Chicago, Bernadin had spoken personally to every priest in the archdiocese. He also prepared and released an audit of the archdiocesan finances.

During the 1983 mayoral election campaign in Chicago, the African-American Congressman Harold Washington faced bitter opposition from the Chicago political machine. Bernadin urged Chicago Catholics to reject racist attacks against Washington; when he was elected, Bernadin met with Washington the day after the election.

In 1984, Bernadin began the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago, the successor group to the Chicago Conference on Religion and Race. The archdiocese also established covenants with the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago in 1986 and with the Metropolitan Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1989.

=== 1990 to 2020 ===

In 1990, Bernadin announced that the archdiocese was closing 37 churches and schools. After Bernadin died in 1996, John Paul II appointed Archbishop Francis George from the Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon as the eighth archbishop of Chicago, George was the first native Chicagoan to become its archbishop.

In 2011, George terminated the foster care program of Catholic Charities in the archdiocese. The State of Illinois had ruled that it would not fund any charities that refused to consider same-sex couples as foster care providers or adoptive parents. George refused to comply with this requirement.

In 2011, the City of Chicago proposed a new route for the June 2012 Chicago Pride Parade, a celebration by the LGBTQ community. However, the archdiocese objected to the new route, saying the parade would pass by Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church during Sunday morning mass. George told an interviewer: &quot;you don&#x27;t want the Gay Liberation Movement to morph into something like the Ku Klux Klan, demonstrating in the streets against Catholicism.&quot; In response, LGBTQ advocates called for George&#x27;s resignation, but George said: &quot;When the pastor&#x27;s request for reconsideration of the plans was ignored, the organizers invited an obvious comparison to other groups who have historically attempted to stifle the religious freedom of the Catholic Church.&quot; City administrators negotiated a compromise plan that delayed the parade start by two hours, allowing it to pass by Our Lady after its mass concluded. Two weeks later, George apologized for his remarks. George died in 2014.

Pope Francis named Bishop Blaise Cupich from the Diocese of Spokane as the next archbishop of Chicago. Cupich announced a major reorganization of the archdiocese in 2015. Approximately 50 archdiocesan employees accepted early retirement packages offered by the archdiocese. In 2016, increasing costs, low attendance at mass and priest shortages prompted the archdiocese to close or consolidate up to 100 parishes and schools over the next 15 years.

=== 2020 to present ===

On December 27, 2021, following the issuing of the in July and the subsequent issuing of guidelines released by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in December, Cupich imposed restrictions on the celebration of the traditional Latin mass in the archdiocese. He banned the usage of the Traditional Rite on the first Sunday of every month, Christmas, the Triduum, Easter Sunday, and Pentecost Sunday. In 2021, the archdiocese announced plans to combine 13 parishes into five clusters, to minister to regions south of Chicago.

On August 1, 2022, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP) announced the celebration of public masses and sacraments at Shrine of Christ the King Church, its headquarters in Chicago. The archdiocese had sent the ICKSP in 2021 its new regulations on the use of the traditional Latin Mass.

As of 2024, 39 churches in Chicago and 21 in the surrounding suburbs have closed and the number of parishes has reduced from 344 to 216.

===Sexual abuse===
==Churches==

In the 1950s, Chicago-area Catholics spoke of which churches they attended and identified themselves via these churches. University of Notre Dame professor Kathleen Sprows Cummings stated that knowing one&#x27;s church revealed demographic information and that it &quot;was an identifier, almost more identifiable than the particular neighborhood that they lived in.&quot;

==Archbishop&#x27;s residence==
The archbishop&#x27;s residence in Chicago is a private guesthouse owned by the Archdiocese of Chicago. It served as the official residence of the archbishops until 2014, when incoming Archbishop Blaise Cupich decided to live in the rectory of Holy Name Cathedral.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the archbishop&#x27;s residence was built in 1885 by Bishop Feehan. A three-story, red brick building, it is one of the oldest structures in the Astor Street District, according to the Landmarks Preservation Council. Before its construction, the bishops of Chicago resided at a home on LaSalle Street and North Avenue. When John Paul II visited Chicago in 1979, he became the first pontiff to stay at the residence. However, both Pius XII and Paul VI resided there during their visits to Chicago as cardinals.

==Bishops==
Since 1915, the Vatican has designated each archbishop of Chicago as a cardinal priest, with membership in the College of Cardinals. As such, they also have responsibilities in the dicasteries of the Roman Curia.

The Office of Catholic Schools operates a system of primary and secondary schools in the archdiocese. A 2015 article in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the archdiocesan schools as the largest private school system in the United States.

The first school in the archdiocese was a boys&#x27; school, opened in Chicago in 1844. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the archdiocese established schools serving Germans, Poles, Czechs, Bohemians, French, Slovaks, Lithuanians, Puerto Rican Americans, African Americans, Italians, and Mexicans. Many of these schools were founded by religious sisters. The school construction boom in the archdiocese ended when Cardinal Cody freezed school construction in Lake County and suburban Cook County.

Between 1984 and 2004, the archdiocese closed 148  schools and 10  school sites. By 2005, over half of its urban schools had closed. In January 2018, the archdiocese announced the closure of five school and In January 2020 it closed five more schools. As of 2022, the archdiocese contained 33 secondary schools; seven were all-girls. seven were all-boys and 19 were co-ed The system had an enrollment of 44,460 students in its primary schools and 19,200 in its secondary schools.

=== Respect Life Office ===
Cardinal George established the Respect Life Office in the archdiocese. It provides educational resources and a speakers bureau, and sponsors conferences, retreats and rallies. The Office runs Project Rachel Post Abortion Healing, a program for women who have abortion procedures; and the Chastity Education Initiative, which advises youth and young adults on sexuality issues.

<doc id="735478" wikidata="Q5586002" url="?curid=735478" title="Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)">
<text>Robert Gordon Wilson (16 April 1938 – 25 June 2017) was a Scottish politician and solicitor. He was the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 1979 to 1990, and was SNP Member of Parliament (MP) for Dundee East from 1974 to 1987. He was Rector of the University of Dundee from 1983 to 1986.

==Background==
Wilson was born in Glasgow, the son of Elizabeth Murray and Robert George Wilson, a butcher&#x27;s van driver. He was educated at Douglas High School for Boys on the Isle of Man, and the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree. Following graduation, Wilson qualified as a solicitor, and worked for T.F. Reid Solicitors in Paisley from 1963 until his election as an MP in 1974.

==Political career==
Wilson joined the Scottish National Party in 1959, on his graduation from university. He was &quot;controller&quot; of the political pirate radio station Radio Free Scotland, which broadcast on a frequency used by BBC between 1956 and 1965, moving the location of the transmitter to avoid being caught. Wilson served as Assistant National Secretary of the SNP from 1963 to 1964, as National Secretary from 1964 to 1971, and was vice-chairman of the SNP Oil Campaign Committee, which was responsible for the party&#x27;s iconic It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s oil campaign. It was Wilson who coined the slogan.

Wilson was Executive Vice-Chairman in 1972–1973, and while Executive Vice-Chairman he had a responsibility for oil. Wilson stood as the SNP parliamentary candidate at the Dundee East by-election in March 1973, where he was narrowly defeated by Labour&#x27;s George Machin. He did however clearly out-poll the Lord Provost of Dundee, William Fitzgerald, who stood as a Conservative and was thought to have had a good chance of winning the seat. Machin was a native of Sheffield and some thought Labour made a mistake by selecting an Englishman for a Scottish seat. Anti-English feeling was reported to be shown during Machin&#x27;s victory speech which was reportedly disrupted by &#x27;angry shouts of Scottish Nationalist supporters&#x27;, with &#x27;chants of &quot;Go back to Yorkshire&quot; and &quot;Go home, Englishman&quot;&#x27;. Wilson was reported to be disappointed by losing narrowly, but was pleased by the considerable increase in the SNP vote since the last general election.

Gordon Wilson was elected as Member of Parliament for the Dundee East constituency at the February 1974 general election, and increased his majority to 6,983 at the October 1974 general election. He was the deputy leader of the SNP parliamentary group at Westminster from 1974 to 1979, and served as parliamentary spokesperson on oil and energy (1974–1983) and joint spokesperson on devolution (1976–1979).

He was one of only two SNP MPs in the aftermath of the 1979 UK general election. Anthony Finlay, writing in &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; opined that Wilson held his seat &quot;only because the Labour Party was foolish enough to pick Jimmy Reid&quot; as his opponent. On 15 September 1979, at the SNP Annual National Conference in Dundee, Wilson was elected as National Convener (leader) of the SNP, succeeding Billy Wolfe. He had with 530 votes, defeating Stephen Maxwell (117 votes) and Willie McRae (52 votes).

When Robin Cook MP moved an amendment to legalise homosexual acts to the Bill which became the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, he stated &quot;The clause bears the names of hon. Members from all three major parties. I regret that the only party represented among Scottish Members of Parliament from which there has been no support for the clause is the Scottish National Party. I am pleased to see both representatives of that party in their place, and I hope to convert them in the remainder of my remarks.&quot; When the amendment came to a vote, Wilson and the SNP&#x27;s other MP Donald Stewart both voted against the decriminalisation of homosexual acts.

In the early 1980s when the party was in internal turmoil, and he was a key mover in condemning both Siol nan Gaidheal and the 79 Group. At the SNP&#x27;s conference in Ayr in June 1982 he announced in the middle of his keynote speech that there would not be &quot;parties within the party&quot;. Using his executive position he was able to force an emergency motion and a vote on his proposal. He received the backing he needed.

Wilson led the party through two poor general election performances in 1983 and 1987. In 1987, Wilson lost his seat to Labour&#x27;s John McAllion. After his defeat at the 1987 general election he returned to legal practice.

He remained as party leader, and Jim Sillars won at the Govan by-election victory in 1988. Wilson attempted to involve the SNP in the Scottish Constitutional Convention but due to the convention&#x27;s unwillingness to contemplate discussions about Scottish independence as a constitutional option the SNP did not get involved. He announced his resignation as leader of the SNP in May 1990, with Alex Salmond succeeding him.

In September 1998 he was selected by delegates at the SNP&#x27;s conference as a candidate for Scotland in the 1999 European Parliament elections. He was placed fourth on the SNP&#x27;s list and with the SNP only winning two of the eight seats, he was unsuccessful.

He wrote three books that were published between 2009 and 2014 which detailed aspects of his political life.

Wilson continued to have a modest presence in Scottish politics after his retirement. He was active in the Scottish independence referendum campaign. In November 2012, he and Sillars suggested that Scotland should consider joining the European Free Trade Association as an alternative to remaining in the EU, and voted Leave in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. Together with Sillars he then established think-tank Options for Scotland, publishing articles and papers.

==Personal life==
Wilson married Edith (née Hassall) in 1965 and they had two daughters and five grandchildren.

Wilson was a devout Christian. Later in life, he was a member of Saint Peter&#x27;s Free Church in Dundee. In 2010, Wilson and David Robertson co-founded Solas (Centre for Public Christianity) - an evangelical Christian body dedicated to the revival of the faith in Scotland and abroad.

He had retired to Broughty Ferry, Dundee and sailed his boat &quot;Saorsa&quot; on the Firth of Tay.

Wilson died from a pulmonary embolism at the Roxburghe House hospice in Dundee on the morning of 25 June 2017, at the age of 79. His funeral was held at Saint Peter&#x27;s Free Church in Dundee on 5 July 2017. His party colleague John Swinney and David Robertson gave eulogies.

==Awards and honours==
He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D) degree by the University of Dundee in 1986.

Wilson&#x27;s papers are held variously by the National Library of Scotland, Archive Services at the University of Dundee and the Scottish Political Archive at the University of Stirling. His collection of historical nationalist pamphlets is held by the Macartney Library at SNP headquarters in Edinburgh.

<doc id="735479" wikidata="Q180993" url="?curid=735479" title="Antonio Cassano">
<text>Antonio Cassano (; born 12 July 1982) is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a forward. A talented and technically gifted player, he was usually deployed as a supporting forward, but could also play as an attacking midfielder, winger, or as a striker. Nicknamed &quot;Il Gioiello di Bari Vecchia&quot; (&quot;the jewel of Old Bari&quot;), and &quot;Fantantonio&quot; (&quot;fantastic Antonio&quot;), he was known for his short temper as much as his skill and ability on the pitch. Cassano won an Italian and Spanish league title each throughout his career as major honours.

Cassano began his senior club career with hometown club Bari in 1999; his performances earned him a transfer to Roma two years later, where he won the Supercoppa Italiana and was twice named Serie A Young Footballer of the Year in 2001 and 2003. In 2006, he moved to La Liga club Real Madrid, where he won a league title, but was chastised for his poor behaviour, inconsistent performances, and work-rate, and returned to Italy a year later, on loan to Sampdoria. There, he refound his form, and was signed by the club on a permanent basis in 2008. He then spent single seasons with AC Milan and cross-city rivals Inter Milan, winning a Serie A title and his Supercoppa Italiana with the former, before signing for Parma in 2013. In 2015, he returned to Sampdoria, and in 2017, signed with Verona. He failed to make an appearance for the club and subsequently retired.

At international level, Cassano represented the Italy national football team on 39 occasions between 2003 and 2014, scoring 10 goals; he took part at three UEFA European Championships, and one FIFA World Cup, winning a runners-up medal at UEFA Euro 2012. Along with Mario Balotelli, he is Italy&#x27;s top-scorer in the UEFA European Championships, with three goals.

Cassano&#x27;s short temper and disputes with managers and teammates led to birth of the neologism &quot;cassanata&quot; by his former coach, Fabio Capello, in 2002. The word is now regularly used by Italian sports journalists as a euphemism for any behavior incompatible with team spirit.

==Club career==
===Bari===
Cassano was born in Bari and his father left the family shortly thereafter. He was raised in poverty by his mother in the San Nicola district of the &quot;Bari Vecchia&quot; neighbourhood, and began playing football on the streets at an early age. Cassano was spotted by a Bari scout and brought up through the team&#x27;s youth system, and he made his Serie A debut for Bari against local rivals Lecce on 11 December 1999. During his time with Bari, he soon emerged as one of Serie A&#x27;s most promising young Italian players, drawing particular attention to himself after scoring a notable, individual, match-winning goal (his first ever Serie A goal) in a 2–1 home win over Italian giants Inter Milan, on 18 December 1999, at the age of 17: in the 88th minute, after controlling a 40-yard lobbed pass on the run with his backheel, he subsequently dribbled past veteran defenders Christian Panucci and Laurent Blanc, wrong-footing goalkeeper Fabrizio Ferron with a dummy, before finishing at the near post. Cassano&#x27;s technical skill, precocious talent and impressive performances earned him the nicknames &quot;&quot;Fantantonio&quot;, due to his flair and creativity, and &quot;El Pibe de Bari&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Kid from Bari&quot;), a reference to the legendary Diego Maradona&#x27;s nickname, &quot;El Pibe de Oro&quot;. During his two seasons with Bari, he scored a total of 6 goals in 48 Serie A matches, scoring 3 goals in 21 appearances during his first season, and 3 goals in 27 league matches during his second season with the club.

===Roma===
In 2001, at the age of 19, Cassano signed with reigning Serie A champions Roma for a transfer fee of 60 billion Italian lire (about €30 million); at the time, this was the most expensive teenage signing ever. His first season produced five goals, as well as a 2001 Supercoppa Italiana victory, and he attracted media attention after openly clashing with coach Fabio Capello after he was left out of a practice match a few days after his international debut. In the 2003 Italian Cup final against Milan, Cassano was sent off after protesting an official&#x27;s decision, and he flashed the sign of the horns at the referee while leaving the pitch. During his time with Roma, he won the Serie A Young Footballer of the Year Award in 2001 and in 2003.

He was omitted from the squad during Roma&#x27;s tumultuous 2004–05 campaign while Luigi Delneri, Roma&#x27;s third coach of the season (after Cesare Prandelli and Rudi Völler), was in charge. After Delneri himself resigned during the season, his replacement, Bruno Conti, returned Cassano to the starting lineup, with Cassano captaining the team in the absence of incumbent Francesco Totti, who was serving a five-match suspension.

During the 2005–06 pre-season, Cassano was in constant conflict with club management over the renewal of his contract, which was due to expire on 30 June 2006. In January 2006, he acrimoniously parted ways with Roma and signed with Real Madrid for just €5M.

===Real Madrid===
Cassano became the second ever Italian player to sign for Real Madrid after former Roma teammate Christian Panucci. His debut came on 18 January 2006 in a Spanish Cup match against Real Betis, and scored his first goal just three minutes after entering the match in the second half. Just four months into his tenure with the club, however, he began gaining weight due to poor eating habits, which resulted in Madrid fining him for every gram he remained over his playing weight, and earned him the nickname &quot;Gordito&quot;.

On 30 October, Real Madrid&#x27;s official website announced that Cassano had been suspended due to his &quot;disrespect&quot; of Capello, who had joined the club at the beginning of 2006–07 season, following a dressing room argument arising from his omission from the team after a game against Gimnàstic de Tarragona, and was subsequently benched along with David Beckham and Ronaldo. In an interview with a Roman radio station, Cassano said he would &quot;walk all the way back&quot; to rejoin Roma, and indicated his eagerness to make peace with Totti, with whom Cassano had conflicted with before his departure from Roma. Cassano, however, remained with Madrid after the January 2007 transfer window had closed, and the rest of his season was cut short by an ankle injury. Despite winning the 2006–07 La Liga title with Real Madrid, Cassano only made seven league appearances, scoring just a single goal.

In an interview with Spanish radio in July 2007, Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón described Cassano&#x27;s attitude as &quot;unsustainable in the last couple of months&quot; and indicated that he would be leaving the club.

===Sampdoria===
On 13 August 2007, Sampdoria took Cassano on a one-year loan, agreeing to pay €1.2 million of his €4.2 million salary. He was presented to approximately 2,500 fans five days later. In his first press conference, Cassano said that he had chosen to wear the shirt number 99 for several reasons: firstly, as his first-choice, the number 18, was already taken by teammate Vladimir Koman, and because 9 plus 9 equals 18, secondly, because his other teammate Francesco Flachi was already wearing the number 10 shirt, which was his second choice, and thirdly, as he intended the number to be an homage to Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who was wearing the same number at Milan.

He made his Sampdoria début that season in the &quot;Derby della Lanterna&quot; against Genoa on 23 September, in which he was substituted by former Roma teammate Vincenzo Montella in the final minutes of the match. Cassano scored his first league goal upon his return against Atalanta a week later, in a 3–0 victory. He scored in three consecutive games in January, and helped end league leaders Inter&#x27;s winning league run with a goal in a 1–1 draw. Cassano, however, was sent off in a 2–2 draw with Torino on 2 March 2008, which he compounded by hurling his shirt at the referee as he left the pitch, and was punished with a five-match ban. Sampdoria ended the season with an UEFA Cup berth, while Cassano was acquired on a permanent basis by the club on free transfer (plus bonus) from Madrid.

In his second season, Cassano confirmed to have temperamentally improved, also becoming vice-captain for the team behind Angelo Palombo. After the January signing of Giampaolo Pazzini from Fiorentina, Cassano managed to form a fruitful striking partnership with the former &quot;Viola&quot; forward, that was praised by both media and Sampdoria supporters, and led club chairman Riccardo Garrone to compare it with striking duo of Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Mancini that led Sampdoria to win their only &quot;Scudetto&quot; to date, an opinion that was later shared also by both Vialli and Mancini. Cassano scored 12 goals in Serie A and helped Sampdoria to reach the Coppa Italia final that season, scoring a goal in the semi-final against the Serie A Champions, Inter. In the final, Sampdoria were defeated by Lazio in a penalty shoot-out, with Cassano missing the first penalty.

His third season with Sampdoria again began very well, as he continued his prolific partnership with Pazzini, and was instrumental in the club&#x27;s impressive seasonal start, that led them up to first place after a 1–0 home win to Inter. However, a result crisis, including a 3–0 defeat in the local derby against crosstown rivals Genoa, left Sampdoria down to mid-table on January, leading head coach Luigi Delneri to put Cassano off the team for &quot;technical and tactical reasons&quot;, casting doubts about the player&#x27;s future at the club.

In the final days of the January transfer window, he was linked with a move on loan to Fiorentina, that was however denied with an official statement from the club, but was described by the media as Cassano&#x27;s own refusal to leave Sampdoria. This was confirmed by Cassano himself through an official statement published on Sampdoria&#x27;s website, citing his relationship with club chairman Riccardo Garrone, his teammates and the team supporters as the main reason for his choice. He soon came back into the starting line-up, and eventually helped Sampdoria to a fourth-place finish UEFA Champions League qualifying spot in Serie A. Sampdoria were defeated by Werder Bremen in the play-off round, however, and were to enter into the Europa League that season. Del Neri left Sampdoria at the end of the season.

Cassano&#x27;s final season with the club was more difficult. In October 2010, Cassano was excluded from the first team squad with immediate effect after he had a heated row with chairman Riccardo Garrone following the player&#x27;s refusal to attend an award ceremony. Following such events, Sampdoria formally applied for a contract termination to a league arbitration panel, a position that was confirmed even after Cassano apologised to Garrone and the club. On 16 December, the arbitration panel ordered Sampdoria to reinclude Cassano into the first team from 1 January 2011, rejecting the &quot;Blucerchiati&quot;&#x27;s request for a contract termination, but also concluding Cassano will be paid only 50% of his salary for the remainder of his contract.

===Milan===
On 20 December 2010, it was reported that Milan, Sampdoria and the player agreed the installment plan to pay a €5 million to Real Madrid which was indicated in Cassano&#x27;s buy-out clause when he left the Spanish club. Eventually Sampdoria paid €5 million to Real Madrid; Milan paid €3.33 million to Sampdoria, while Cassano had a wage cut with Milan. Cassano then signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Milan, which was later confirmed by Milan&#x27;s owner Silvio Berlusconi, replacing the gap left by Ronaldinho&#x27;s departure. His former strike partner at Sampdoria, Giampaolo Pazzini, also left the club in January to move to Milan&#x27;s city rivals, Inter. Cassano made his debut for his new club in a 1–0 win against Cagliari where he came on as a substitute for Alexander Merkel in the latter stages of the game. He scored his first goal for Milan in a 4–0 win against Parma. He went on to score three more goals that season, as Milan claimed the 2010–11 Serie A title that season, Cassano&#x27;s first &quot;Scudetto&quot; of his career; two of these goals came against former clubs Bari and Sampdoria, and the other one from a penalty against fierce rivals Inter on 2 April 2011, after coming on as a substitute; he was later sent off during the same match after being booked twice. In the meantime, Sampdoria struggled without Cassano and Pazzini, and were relegated to Serie B at the end of the season.

As Cassano faced competition for a spot in the Milan starting XI from the likes of forwards Zlatan Ibrahimović, Alexandre Pato and Robinho, a lot of speculation formed over his future for the following season, as Cassano wanted to gain more playing time, due to his wish to keep his spot in the Italian national side. Although he was initially linked to other clubs, he stayed with Milan, and after a good pre-season, he won the 2011 Supercoppa Italiana with Milan over Inter, and he scored in the first Serie A game of the 2011–12 season against Lazio. On 29 October 2011, following Milan&#x27;s match against Roma in Rome, Cassano was hospitalised after suffering a stroke upon arriving in Milan, and was operated on 4 November. He returned to the first team on 7 April 2012, after almost six months on the side-lines, featuring as a substitute in Milan&#x27;s 2–1 home defeat to Fiorentina in Serie A, and received a standing ovation from the crowd as he entered the pitch for Gianluca Zambrotta in the 79th minute. He also appeared as a substitute in a 1–0 home win against Genoa on 25 April, and on 29 April, he scored his first goal since his operation, in a 4–1 win over Siena, also setting up both of Ibrahimović&#x27;s goals during the match. Milan finished the Serie A season in second place behind Juventus, also reaching the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, and the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

===Internazionale===
After reportedly being upset over the sale of Milan&#x27;s key players, particularly Zlatan Ibrahimović and Thiago Silva, Cassano requested a transfer. On 21 August 2012, Milan and Inter reached an agreement over an exchange deal involving Giampaolo Pazzini and Cassano, with a compensatory sum of €7.5 million in favor of the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot;. (Pazzini tagged for €13 million and Cassano for €5.5 million.) He officially joined the team the next day. Cassano signed a two-year contract with the club. Cassano&#x27;s season at Inter was negative, as the club struggled in the league, while Cassano only scored five league goals and often argued with manager Andrea Stramaccioni, although he provided nine assists in Serie A. The club finished the 2012–13 Serie A season in ninth place. In total, he scored 9 goals in 39 games for Inter in all competitions, providing 15 assists.

===Parma===
After only one season at Inter, Cassano joined Parma on 4 July 2013 on a temporary deal, and was given the number 99 shirt that he had also worn at previous clubs. Cassano&#x27;s work-rate, fitness and discipline improved at Parma, as he managed to keep control of his weight through a stricter diet and training regime, losing 10 kg. On 30 November, he scored his 100th Serie A goal in a 1–1 home draw against Bologna. He refound his form with the club and had a successful 2013–14 season at Parma, as he helped the club to a sixth-place finish in the league, achieving a Europa League qualifying spot, also scoring 13 goals and managing 8 assists in 36 appearances in all competitions, with 12 goals and 7 assists coming in Serie A. In February 2014, he signed a pre-contract agreement with Parma for the 2014–15 season.

In the first half of the 2014–15 season, Cassano managed 5 goals in 20 appearances as Parma were rooted to the bottom of the table and battling serious financial difficulties. On 26 January 2015, Parma allowed Cassano to terminate his contract with the club in advance, which made him a free agent; due to the club&#x27;s financial struggles, he had reportedly not been paid his wages since June 2014. Following the termination of his contract, he was initially linked with a return to Inter.

===Return to Sampdoria===
Following his release from Parma back in January of the same year, Cassano re-joined former club Sampdoria for a third time on 9 August 2015. He agreed a two-year deal with the club, lasting until 30 June 2017. He scored his first goal since his return to the club on 10 January 2016, in the 64th minute of a 2–1 home defeat to Juventus.

During the 2016–17 pre-season, the club&#x27;s president Massimo Ferrero communicated that Cassano was not a part of his plans, and was excluded from the Sampdoria first team. Cassano rejected offers from several clubs and obtained permission to train with the Sampdoria youth side, in particular with the Primavera team&#x27;s goalkeeper.

On 25 January 2017, Cassano terminated his contract with Sampdoria by mutual consent.

===Hellas Verona, Entella trial and retirement===
On 10 July 2017, Cassano was signed by Verona. He appeared in two summer friendlies for the club the next week; however, on 18 July, he was involved in a curious incident, which gained much publicity in the media: he initially communicated that he would be retiring from football, as he missed his family too much, before holding a press conference later the same day, in which he announced that he had reversed his decision, and stated that he was looking forward to &quot;having a fun season&quot; with Verona. However, on 24 July, he overturned his decision once again, stating that he would be leaving the club and retiring from football, commenting: &quot;As opposed to what appeared on my wife’s official social profiles, I would like to clarify the following. Carolina was wrong, after thinking and reflecting in the end I decided. Antonio Cassano will not play football anymore. I apologise to the city of Verona, to all the fans, to the president. For a 35-year-old man I need to be motivated and at this moment I feel that my priority is represented by being close to my children and my wife.&quot; On 27 July, Cassano&#x27;s contract with Verona was officially terminated by mutual consent, before he had played any official matches for the club; regarding his reasons for parting ways with Verona so suddenly, he later stated in an interview with &quot;Tiki Taka&quot; that &quot;[t]here was no spark there&quot;, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s like when you’re seeing a woman and she no longer attracts you, so you leave. I took a big risk 12 years ago leaving Real Madrid for Sampdoria. I didn&#x27;t feel like making a similar choice this time. I knew this would be a season of suffering for Verona, but I didn&#x27;t know if I could give 100 per cent to avoid relegation. I gave up a lot of money, which not everyone would do. I left things on good terms with them, we have a good rapport.&quot; In spite of his previous comments, on 31 July, however, he stated that he would not be retiring, and that he was looking for a new club closer to home, but added that he would retire if he did not sign with a club by September. Although he received no other offers from Italian clubs, and was ultimately unable to sign for a team prior to the end of the summer transfer window, in September Cassano stated that he would be following a fitness training schedule given to him by his former Sampdoria fitness coach Agostino Tibaudi, and that he was hoping to sign for a club in the January transfer window. In spite of rumours in the media of Cassano being linked with several clubs for January, towards the end of September, he once again stated that he was &quot;done&quot; with football.

After a year of inactivity, in August 2018, Cassano announced that he was looking to return to football. In October 2018, it was confirmed he was about to start training with Serie C team Virtus Entella, a club he was already linked to in the past. In a prior interview a few days earlier, he had rejected reports linking him to Monza after Berlusconi&#x27;s acquisition of the club, stating Virtus Entella would be the only club from outside of Serie A he would be willing to join. A few days later, however, he confirmed that he had officially retired from football.

==International career==
Cassano made 39 appearances for the Italy national team, scoring ten goals. He made his senior international debut on 12 November 2003, aged 21, in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Poland in Warsaw, in which he also scored his first goal.

Cassano was included in Italy&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2004 squad by manager Giovanni Trapattoni. He was initially thought to serve as a reserve, but after Francesco Totti was suspended following a spitting incident with Christian Poulsen in Italy&#x27;s opening group match against Denmark, which ended in a 0–0 draw, Cassano was inserted into the starting lineup for a 1–1 draw with Sweden, in which he scored the opening goal. In Italy&#x27;s final group match, which ended in a 2–1 victory over Bulgaria, he was named man of the match, as he was involved in Simone Perrotta&#x27;s equaliser, and also netted the last-minute winner, but Italy were eliminated in the group stage on direct encounters after a three-way, five-point tie with Denmark and Sweden.

After a poor season with Real Madrid, Cassano was left off coach Marcello Lippi&#x27;s final roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The &quot;Azzurri&quot; went on to lift the trophy in Berlin, beating France in a penalty shootout.

In September 2006, Cassano was called up by new manager Roberto Donadoni for Euro 2008 qualifiers against Lithuania and France. However, he was not selected again until surprisingly being included in the Euro 2008 squad. He went scoreless in the tournament as Italy were eliminated in the quarter-finals by eventual champions Spain after a penalty shootout.

Lippi returned as coach for the 2010 World Cup qualification campaign and did not select Cassano during the qualifying matches or the 2010 World Cup finals. After a two-year absence from the &quot;Azzurri&quot;, and following widespread criticism from the media towards Lippi about his exclusion from the World Cup squad, Cassano was readmitted into the squad on 6 August 2010 by new head coach Cesare Prandelli for his first game in charge of the team, a friendly match against the Ivory Coast played on 10 August at Upton Park, London. Almost a month later, in Italy&#x27;s Euro 2012 qualifier played in Estonia, Cassano scored the tying goal in a 1–2 away victory and also assisted Leonardo Bonucci&#x27;s second goal with a back-heel. Cassano scored a long-range goal from just outside the box in Italy&#x27;s 5–0 qualifying win over the Faroe Islands. He scored again against Estonia helping Italy secure a 3–0 win.

Cassano played in all six of Italy&#x27;s matches and scored one goal against the Republic of Ireland during Euro 2012, where the Italians reached the final, losing 4–0 against Spain. In the semi-final against Germany, Cassano set up Mario Balotelli&#x27;s first goal of the match. Cassano wore the number 10 shirt for Italy throughout the tournament. In July 2012, he was fined by UEFA for making a homophobic comment at a press conference during Euro 2012. At the conference, when asked if he thought there were any homosexual players in the Italian team, he replied, &quot;I hope there are none.&quot; He later issued a statement saying he had been misinterpreted.

Despite not featuring during the qualification campaign, Cassano was selected in Italy&#x27;s squad for the 2014 World Cup. On 20 June 2014, at the age of 31, Cassano made his World Cup debut as a substitute in a 1–0 loss to Costa Rica. He also appeared as a substitute in Italy&#x27;s 1–0 defeat to Uruguay, in their final group match on 24 June, which resulted in Italy&#x27;s elimination in the first round of the tournament for the second consecutive time. Cassano was criticised by the press for his poor performances and lack of fitness, as he failed to improve his team&#x27;s results and did not provide pace and creativity to the team&#x27;s attacking plays. This would be his final appearance for Italy, as he was no longer called up by Italy&#x27;s new manager, Antonio Conte, after the tournament.

==Style of play==
A creative forward, or &quot;fantasista&quot;, in Italian, who usually functioned as an assist provider in his teams, due to his ability to create chances for teammates (Cassano himself once stated that he preferred creating goals to scoring them), Cassano was capable of playing anywhere along or behind the front-line, on either flank or through the centre of the pitch; in addition to his usual role as a second striker, he was able to act as an advanced playmaker, and was also deployed in a central role as a main striker, as a false-9, or even as a winger on occasion. Cassano has been described as a player who was &quot;skillful and intelligent on the ball&quot; who possessed &quot;excellent vision and also impresses with his eye for goal&quot;. His best technical qualities were his trapping skills, control, dribbling, crossing ability and passing accuracy; although naturally right-footed, he could also strike well with either foot. In addition to his skills, touch and excellent technique, Cassano also possessed considerable upper-body strength and balance, which aided him in defending the ball with his back to goal despite his diminutive stature, and allowed him to retain possession in tight spaces, while his technical ability and acceleration enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, or when dribbling at speed. He was also effective from set-pieces and penalties.

Despite his flair, ability and talent, throughout his career, Cassano was also criticised for his behaviour and lack of discipline, both on and off the pitch, which often led him to pick up unnecessary cards; he was also condemned for his poor work-rate and lack of fitness throughout different intervals of his career, which led him to gain weight, and lose some of his speed, stamina, and agility. Although he was initially regarded as one of the most promising young players of his generation, even being described as Roberto Baggio&#x27;s heir, due to his inconsistency, difficult character, and unpredictability, many in the sport, including his former manager Fabio Capello, have argued that he did not live up to the potential he demonstrated in his youth, and that his personality affected his career.

==Post-retirement==
During 2019, Cassano was a pundit for Italia 1 football show &quot;Tiki Taka&quot;.

In December 2019, Cassano successfully completed a director of football course at Coverciano.

He successively joined fellow friends and former Serie A footballers Christian Vieri, Daniele Adani and Nicola Ventola in a regular Twitch show named &quot;Bobo TV&quot;, which started in 2020 during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy.

==Personal life==
Cassano got engaged to water polo player Carolina Marcialis in 2008, then married on 19 June 2010 at a church, Chiesa di San Martino, in Portofino. The couple have two sons.

On 30 October 2011, it was reported that Cassano complained of finding it difficult to speak or move on the team plane when the team returned to Milan. Three days later, his club Milan announced and confirmed that he was suffering from ischemic-based cerebral damage, though it was thought to be only temporary. Cassano underwent minor heart surgery soon after.

==Controversy==
In addition to his skill, Cassano is known for his temper, poor behaviour and lack of discipline; these have led to several controversial incidents both on and off the pitch throughout his career, which have thus been dubbed &quot;Cassanate&quot; by the press and his former manager Capello.

During a Euro 2012 press conference, Cassano stated his preference for there to be no gay players on the squad and used a derogatory descriptor; he was subsequently fined by UEFA for making homophobic comments.

On 1 February 2013, Cassano had a locker room brawl with his then coach at Inter, Andrea Stramaccioni. It occurred following Friday&#x27;s training session and had started off as a relatively normal discussion before the pair got into a heated slanging match, then degenerated into pushing and shoving before the other players intervened to pull them apart.

==Sponsorship==
Cassano was a brand ambassador for Diadora, and wore their Evoluzione K Pro GX 14 football boots in black and fluorescent yellow throughout his career.

<text>WTLV (channel 12) is a television station in Jacksonville, Florida, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside Orange Park–licensed ABC affiliate WJXX (channel 25), a combination known as First Coast News. The two stations share studios on East Adams Street (near EverBank Stadium) in downtown Jacksonville; WTLV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Anders Boulevard in the city&#x27;s Killarney Shores section.

Channel 12 in Jacksonville began broadcasting on September 1, 1957, as WFGA-TV. Owned by the Florida-Georgia Television Company, it was the third station to be built in the city and an NBC affiliate. After WJHP-TV folded less than two months later, Jacksonville had two stations until 1966. WFGA-TV spent most of its first 15 years on air embroiled in legal conflict stemming from an influence scandal involving a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner. The case was ultimately resolved in 1969 by an operating consortium comprising Florida-Georgia and three groups also seeking channel 12, which was enshrined as its regular ownership in 1971. Shortly after, the station changed its call sign to WTLV.

Harte-Hanks Newspapers acquired WTLV in 1975. In 1980, the station switched affiliations from NBC to ABC at a time when ABC was number-one nationally and NBC stuck in third. ABC&#x27;s ratings lead did not last, and by the middle of the decade, being an ABC affiliate was weighing on WTLV. In 1988, Gannett bought WTLV from Harte-Hanks and nearly immediately switched its affiliation back to NBC. Over the course of the 1990s, the station became more competitive and posed the most serious challenge yet to the traditional news ratings leader in Jacksonville, WJXT (channel 4).

In 1999, as the FCC legalized duopolies, Gannett agreed to buy WJXX from Allbritton Communications. WJXX—which had been established as the city&#x27;s new ABC affiliate in 1997—had been such a ratings underperformer that the combination of the two major network affiliates was permissible. Upon taking control in March 2000, WJXX&#x27;s operation was combined with WTLV&#x27;s, with mostly WTLV personnel and in WTLV&#x27;s studios, as First Coast News. The combined news operation has remained the second-rated outlet in the market.

==History==
===Construction===
In April 1952, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lifted a years-long freeze on new TV station grants, opening the door to new TV stations in Jacksonville. Days after the freeze was lifted, the Florida-Georgia Television Company announced its intention to seek the channel. One of the stockholders in Florida-Georgia was Harold Cohn, who owned Jacksonville radio station WRHC. He stated his interest in television began in 1951, when a man told him he stopped listening to Cohn&#x27;s radio station because he was watching more TV. That man was Alexander Brest, another stakeholder in the firm. Also represented was Miami movie theater operator Wometco Enterprises and its chairman, Mitchell Wolfson.

Florida-Georgia and two other groups sought channel 12: the city of Jacksonville, a broadcaster by its ownership of radio station WJAX, and the Jacksonville Broadcasting Company, owner of WPDQ (600 AM). These groups had each obtained pre-freeze permits then not acted on them. WJAX had previously held a pre-freeze construction permit for channel 2, and the FCC&#x27;s final 1950 deletion of the permit was upheld in court in May 1951; WPDQ-TV&#x27;s permit had been deleted in the same initial action. The FCC designated the three applications for hearing in January 1954, and FCC hearing examiner Charles J. Frederick delivered the initial decision in April 1955. It called for granting channel 12 to Jacksonville Broadcasting based on its superior integration of ownership and management—in other words, the participation of station owners in station operations.

The losing parties to the initial decision—Florida-Georgia and the city of Jacksonville—appealed the initial decision to the commission, which overturned it on August 31, 1956. In a 4–2 vote, the commission granted channel 12 to the Florida-Georgia Television Company. The two dissenters agreed with the original 1955 decision favoring WPDQ. Construction on channel 12&#x27;s studios, on Adams Street near the Gator Bowl, began in January 1957, even as Jacksonville Broadcasting and the city of Jacksonville contested the award. On May 29, 1957, the appeals court upheld the award to Florida-Georgia and rejected a plea for denial by WJHP-TV (channel 36), an ultra high frequency (UHF) station that feared being driven out of business. By this time, the Adams Street studios were nearly complete, and foundations had been poured for the station&#x27;s tower.

WFGA-TV broadcast its first test pattern on August 14, 1957, with regular programming following on September 1. It was affiliated from the start with NBC. Management boasted that WFGA-TV was the first station designed and built with color telecasting in mind; the station had color as well as black and white studio cameras. 

WJHP-TV ceased telecasting on October 25, 1957, its problems having been exacerbated by WFGA-TV&#x27;s debut; a country music program hosted by a young Johnny Tillotson, still attending the University of Florida at the time, moved from WJHP-TV to WFGA-TV after channel 36 folded. After it closed, ABC programming was split by WFGA-TV and Jacksonville&#x27;s other commercial station, WMBR-TV/WJXT (channel 4). ABC represented about 25 percent of the network programming aired on channel 12. Jacksonville would not have a full-time ABC affiliate—or a third commercial station—again until WJKS-TV began on channel 17 in February 1966.

In addition to Tillotson, WFGA-TV brought a variety of local programs to Jacksonville screens in its early years. It produced the local version of children&#x27;s television franchise &quot;Romper Room&quot; for 14 years from 1956 to 1970, with local schoolteacher Vivian Huff as &quot;Miss Penny&quot;. For twelve years, from 1961 to 1973, &quot;Skipper Ed&quot; McCullers hosted cartoons; after the show ended, McCullers remained at channel 12 as public affairs director until 1988. Viewers across the country saw coverage of space launches at Cape Canaveral through WFGA-TV&#x27;s cameras and facilities. Not only did WFGA-TV supply footage to NBC, but it often provided the press pool feed for other networks.

As WFGA-TV was getting on the air, a scandal involving the FCC&#x27;s decisions in several contested television station cases exploded into view. In January 1958, syndicated columnist Drew Pearson published a column alleging that FCC commissioner Richard Mack, a Florida native, had been influenced to switch the approval of channel 10 in Miami to a company affiliated with National Airlines. The resulting congressional investigation uncovered other cases of &quot;ex parte&quot; communications between attorneys and FCC commissioners on matters before the commission. Among the proceedings the committee investigated was that of channel 12 in Jacksonville. In April 1962, an FCC hearing examiner recommended the grant be voided because of Mack&#x27;s involvement in the vote and found the other two applicants unqualified; the FCC overturned the initial decision in September 1963 and reaffirmed its original 1956 grant to Florida-Georgia, finding no improprieties on its behalf. It disqualified Jacksonville Broadcasting for its own &quot;ex parte&quot; contacts, while the city of Jacksonville application was denied as inferior to Florida-Georgia and not—as earlier proposed—for contacts made by one city commissioner.

In May 1965, a three-judge appeals court panel reversed most of the 1963 FCC ruling and concurred with the original April 1962 denial. It ordered the commission to open channel 12 to new applicants, as the city of Jacksonville had withdrawn from the proceeding and the judges upheld the disqualification of Jacksonville Broadcasting. Florida-Georgia survived the threat of disqualification on a 2–1 vote; in a partial dissent, Warren E. Burger said that both or neither of Jacksonville Broadcasting and Florida-Georgia should have been disqualified. The court rejected the two applicants&#x27; requests for rehearing, affirming the decision. In compliance with the court ruling, the FCC formally vacated the grants of WFGA-TV and WFTV in Orlando, which had a very similar &quot;ex parte&quot;–rooted case, in November 1965, though it allowed WFGA-TV to telecast in the interim.

With the channel 12 proceeding opened to all comers, the FCC began receiving bids from new applicants. The Community First Corporation, a consortium of local businessmen, had been formed in 1960 to seek a proposed channel 10 drop-in, but that never materialized; five years later, it filed for channel 12. Florida Gateway Television was headed by former Florida governor C. Farris Bryant. New Horizons Telecasting. These three competitors and Florida-Georgia were placed into comparative hearing status on July 7, 1967.

In September 1968, the Court of Appeals ordered the FCC to consider the interim operating authority requests from competing applicants for WFGA-TV and WFTV. These applications sought for groups to run the stations until a final decision was made on the underlying license. For WFGA-TV, proposals were received from Jacksonville University, St. John&#x27;s Cathedral, and educational TV station WJCT. However, the appeals court rejected interim operators that were not seeking to run the stations on a full-time basis. With the shutdown of channel 12 the only other option, in January 1969, the FCC authorized all four pending applicants to join forces in an interim operator for WFGA-TV. Florida-Georgia agreed to lease the WFGA-TV facilities to the operator, and the existing staff was maintained except for the station president.

The hearing initially continued after the interim operation came into place. In 1970, the parties reached a settlement to assign the license to Channel 12 of Jacksonville, a permanent consortium of the four applicants and their stockholders. Channel 12 of Jacksonville consisted of 74 different stockholders, with the largest share being held by Wometco at 11 percent. The FCC approved in June 1971, and the new arrangement came into force on July 23. As part of a campaign to create a new image for the station, WFGA-TV changed its call sign to WTLV (for &quot;television&quot;) on December 13, 1971.

===Harte-Hanks ownership and switch to ABC===
By 1974, Channel 12 of Jacksonville had received four offers for the station. One of the four, Harte-Hanks Newspapers of San Antonio, Texas, presented a buyout offer to the firm&#x27;s stockholders. On September 30, Harte-Hanks announced it had secured a controlling 51-percent interest in Channel 12 of Jacksonville and would seek to purchase the remainder; the $10.5 million deal received FCC approval in March 1975.

Beginning in 1977, speculation emerged that WTLV might switch its network affiliation from NBC to ABC. At the time, ABC had surpassed NBC in the national ratings and was seeking affiliate upgrades nationwide, but it was stuck in Jacksonville on WJKS-TV, a station that did not even air an early-evening newscast. The comments were further bolstered by remarks made by ABC network president Jim Duffy stating that he had talked with other Jacksonville stations. WTLV signed a two-year renewal with NBC for 1978 through 1980, pinning its hopes on new NBC chairman Fred Silverman, but less than a year after signing the renewal, on May 3, 1979, WTLV announced it would switch to ABC in 1980. While NBC&#x27;s affiliation agreement did not expire until September 1, the switch was moved forward to March 31, 1980. This was done to allow NBC to air the 1980 Summer Olympics on channel 17, which was projected to benefit the new affiliate.

Not long after the 1980 switch, the ratings fortunes of NBC and ABC reversed. By 1986, the president of Harte-Hanks&#x27;s broadcasting division, Bill Moll, estimated that WTLV could improve its revenues by 12 percent if it returned to NBC, and the company had been in open dialogue with NBC since 1981. Moll admitted that switching to ABC &quot;was a short-term help, and it&#x27;s not helping us now&quot;. Harte-Hanks attempted to improve the station by dispatching management from WFMY-TV in Greensboro, North Carolina, a top-rated CBS affiliate, to WTLV. In 1985, NBC pitched an affiliation switch to WTLV, with station management and ownership opting to remain with ABC; in 1986, NBC was also linked to talks with WJXT. By May 1987, WTLV was a distant third in the local ratings. That year, ABC moved to reduce the network compensation it paid WTLV and 15 other affiliates that it deemed were being overpaid for their performance, many of whom had been lured to the network by high rates; channel 12 saw a 20- to 25-percent cut.

In 1986, Harte-Hanks named Linda Rios Brook the general manager of WTLV. Rios Brook made aggressive syndicated program purchases to bolster a non-network inventory that was poorly performing in the ratings, especially in the afternoons; these included purchasing the rights to &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; from WJXT at prices that reportedly set market records.

===Gannett ownership and return to NBC===
In 1984, Harte-Hanks underwent a leveraged buyout that saddled it with $700 million in debt. To reduce this load, Harte-Hanks put a number of its divisions up for sale in October 1987, including three newspapers, seven cable systems, and WTLV and WFMY-TV. That December, Gannett agreed to buy the two TV stations for $155 million. The transaction was completed in February 1988.

The Gannett purchase reignited speculation about an affiliate change. On February 17, 1988, within two weeks of taking control, Gannett announced that WTLV would return to NBC, replacing WJKS-TV and undoing the 1980 swap. Rios Brook told &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; that the market had &quot;never fully accepted&quot; the 1980 switch, which instead favored WJKS. At the time, NBC was number-one and seeking to improve its affiliate lineup much as ABC had years prior. The stations made the switch on April 3; the switch so soon was speculated to be a move by WJKS owner Media General to hinder NBC&#x27;s position. After the switch, WTLV&#x27;s news and non-news ratings saw immediate improvements from the replacement of low-rated ABC with higher-rated NBC.

===Duopoly with WJXX===
On November 15, 1999, the FCC legalized television station duopolies—the common ownership of two stations in one market. The next day, November 16, Gannett announced it would purchase WJXX, which had been Jacksonville&#x27;s ABC affiliate since February 1997, from Allbritton Communications. The deal was initiated after Allbritton approached Gannett about a possible sale. The new duopoly rules barred cross-ownership of two of the top four television stations in the same market, a restriction that typically prevented Big Four network affiliates from coming under common ownership. However, WJXX&#x27;s fifth-place finish in total-day ratings allowed the deal.

WJXX had struggled in two and a half years of existence. Its launch was rushed after WJKS-TV, the outgoing ABC affiliate, began preempting more than half of ABC&#x27;s prime time programming; this led to signal deficiencies and a poor picture on local cable systems. WJXX introduced a news operation in December 1997, but the circumstances forced Allbritton to divert its attention to the installation of temporary facilities. Seven months of inadequate transmitter coverage of Jacksonville and the even longer stretch without a direct feed to the cable company confused and alienated viewers just as channel 25 needed to make a good first impression. Furthermore, WJXX suffered from ABC&#x27;s continued underperformance in the Jacksonville market. In 2003, Charlie Patton, television editor for &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot;, noted that &quot;Jacksonville never acquired the ABC habit&quot;. Channel 25&#x27;s news ratings, despite a product considered superior to that WJKS had produced as an ABC affiliate, lagged WJXT and WTLV; one bright spot was the market&#x27;s only local newscast at 7 p.m. It became apparent that the combination of WTLV and WJXX would rely heavily on the former&#x27;s facility and personnel, causing WJXX staffers to begin to depart.
The FCC approved the purchase on March 16, 2000. Gannett took control the next morning, and about 36 WJXX employees—including 13 in news—joined the new combined WTLV-based operation, which immediately began simulcasting newscasts on both stations before relaunching on April 27 under the umbrella brand of First Coast News. Newscasts continued to be broadcast at the same time on each station, including the WJXX 7 p.m. newscast.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WTLV and WJXX were retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

WTLV was fined $55,000 by the FCC in 2017 for airing Jacksonville Jaguars promos that included the Emergency Alert System tones.

==News operation==
When WFGA-TV began broadcasting, the station&#x27;s first news director was Harold Baker, who had served in the same position at WSM radio and television in Nashville, Tennessee. Baker would anchor the station&#x27;s 6 p.m. news for 17 years and direct the nascent channel 12 newsroom for 19 years in total, winning the station major national journalism awards. With two notable exceptions—a short period in the early 1960s under Baker when channel 12 surpassed WJXT and in 1975 when WTLV tied it in early evening news—it settled in as a consistent second-place finisher to WJXT in local news, though it worked to close the gap, particularly after its acquisition by Gannett in 1988.

In 1973, the WTLV newscasts were retitled &quot;Action News&quot;. The station spent most of the 1970s and early 1980s continually revamping its news product to compete with WJXT, with regular changes in staff and format. WTLV launched the city&#x27;s first morning newscast, &quot;Good Morning Jacksonville&quot;, in March 1982; conceived to complement ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, it offered news, features, and weather. Shortly before the program debuted, the station hired a second meteorologist, Tim Deegan, who at 22 was said to look like a &quot;surfer kid&quot; by management. He stayed with the station and moved to evenings in 1986, where he spent 36 years appearing on the late news and continues to provide the weather in First Coast News&#x27;s early-evening newscasts, with his retirement set for May 30, 2025.

After years of stagnating ratings and a short-lived ratings surge from WJKS, WTLV relaunched its local newscasts in January 1986 with a new title, &quot;The News on 12&quot;, and new anchors, Lee Webb and Marcia Ladendorff. The changes were the latest for a station that already had a &quot;revolving door&quot; reputation with high turnover in anchors.

After Rios Brook became general manager, the station began a deeper reconstruction; with Gannett&#x27;s acquisition, the situation of channel 12 was likened to KARE in Minneapolis, a longtime news underperformer that had become competitive after Gannett purchased the station and relaunched its news product. In the years following the switch back to NBC, WTLV mounted a strong challenge to WJXT and at its peak in the July 1991 sweeps beat the station at 11 p.m. by one percentage point of television viewers. Though WJXT continued to hold a commanding lead at 6 p.m., WTLV had leads among younger viewers and those newer to the market. The Webb–Ladendorff duo also provided WTLV with heretofore rare stability on its evening newscasts. However, after 1991, the station&#x27;s late news ratings momentum plateaued. WJXT responded to WTLV by adding early evening newscasts and increasing its community involvement. That station rebounded as WTLV cooled, with channel 4 holding a 10-percentage-point lead at 11 p.m. by November 1993. The newscasts were retooled again; Ladendorff had left earlier in the year to become a college instructor, and Webb was dismissed at year&#x27;s end.

WTLV was the first local television rights partner for the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars of the NFL and spent six seasons, from 1995 through 2000, airing the team&#x27;s preseason games and coaches&#x27; shows. During this time, WTLV sports director Dan Hicken served as the play-by-play announcer for the preseason telecasts and hosted a regular Monday night sports discussion show, &quot;Monday Night Live&quot;. The latter was co-hosted by several former players during its run on the air, including Tony Boselli, John Jurkovic, and Jeff Lageman. WTLV lost the rights to WJXT before the 2001 season.

By February 2000, the last ratings survey before the launch of &quot;First Coast News&quot;, WTLV was within three percentage points of WJXT at 11 p.m. but much further behind in early evening news, where WJXT had double the viewers at 6 p.m.

==Technical information==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
WTLV began broadcasting a digital signal on VHF channel 13 on April 17 or May 2, 2000, making it the first to do so in Jacksonville. On June 12, 2009, WTLV ended regular programming on its analog signal, on VHF channel 12, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television; for a short time thereafter, the analog signal broadcast a nightlight service to provide transition information. The digital signal remained on channel 13.

In 2024, WTLV was approved to move its signal to the UHF band on channel 33.

<doc id="735485" wikidata="Q3477884" url="?curid=735485" title="Bridgeport, New Jersey">
<text>Bridgeport is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community that is part of Logan Township, in Gloucester County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. At the 2020 United States census, the population of the CDP was 389. in the 2010 census, the population was 504.

The area is served as United States Postal Service ZIP Code 08014.

==History==
Bridgeport, along with Swedesboro (Sveaborg) and Finns Point (Varkens Kill), was one of only three settlements established in New Jersey as a part of the New Sweden colony, the fort at Nya Elfsborg having been abandoned. The settlement was founded around 1650, and originally called Nya Stockholm, &quot;New Stockholm&quot;, but the name was changed at a later date.

After the 2001 anthrax attacks, a facility was set up in Bridgeport for the use of a continuous wave accelerator called a Rhodotron, from the Belgian company IBA, to irradiate federal mail.

==Geography==
Bridgeport lies along the Delaware River at the mouth of the Raccoon Creek. U.S. Route 322 (US 322) enters New Jersey in Bridgeport via the Commodore Barry Bridge, and continues on to cross US 130 and Interstate 295 before leaving Logan Township. Route 44 is an old alignment of US 130, beginning at a point north of US 322. Route 324 is an east-west state highway completely within Bridgeport, running from where a ferry used to take US 322 across the river to a dead end next to the current US 322. Bridgeport Speedway is located in the community. There is a private marina and a small airfield in town, and a Penns Grove Secondary line crosses Raccoon Creek at the Conrail Railroad Bridge in Bridgeport at mile 2.0.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, informally known as the Senate Judiciary Committee, is a standing committee of 22 U.S. senators whose role is to oversee the Department of Justice (DOJ), consider executive and judicial nominations, and review pending legislation.

In addition, the Standing Rules of the Senate confer jurisdiction to the Senate Judiciary Committee in certain areas, such as considering proposed constitutional amendments and legislation related to federal criminal law, human rights law, immigration, intellectual property, antitrust law, and internet privacy.

== History ==
Established in 1816 as one of the original standing committees in the United States Senate, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary is one of the oldest and most influential committees in Congress. Its broad legislative jurisdiction has assured its primary role as a forum for the public discussion of social and constitutional issues. The committee is also responsible for oversight of key activities of the executive branch, and is responsible for the initial stages of the confirmation process of all judicial nominations for the federal judiciary.

=== Nominations ===
The committee considers presidential nominations for positions in the DOJ—including the Attorney-General and the Director of the FBI—, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the State Justice Institute, and certain positions in the Department of Commerce and DHS. It is also in charge of holding hearings and investigating judicial nominations to the Supreme Court, the U.S. court of appeals, the U.S. district courts, and the Court of International Trade.

If a majority on the committee votes to advance a nomination, the nominee is reported favorably to the whole Senate, which can vote by simple majority to confirm the nominee.

=== Oversight ===
The Judiciary Committee&#x27;s oversight of the DOJ includes all of the agencies under the DOJ&#x27;s jurisdiction, such as the FBI. It also has oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

<text>Tang, known in historiography as the Later Tang, was a short-lived imperial dynasty of China and the second of the Five Dynasties during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in Chinese history.

The first three of the Later Tang&#x27;s four emperors were ethnically Shatuo. The name Tang was used to legitimize itself as the restorer of the Tang dynasty. Although the Later Tang officially began in 923, the dynasty already existed in the years before, as a polity known in historiography as the Former Jin (907–923).

At its height, Later Tang controlled most of northern China.

<doc id="735506" wikidata="Q11972379" url="?curid=735506" title="Gordon Wilson (peace campaigner)">
<text>Gordon Wilson (25 September 1927 – 27 June 1995) was a draper in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, who became known internationally as a peace campaigner during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

On 8 November 1987 a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded during Enniskillen&#x27;s Remembrance Day parade, injuring Wilson and fatally injuring his daughter Marie, a nurse. In an emotional television interview with the BBC only hours after the bombing, Wilson described his final conversation with his dying daughter as they both lay buried in rubble and his hand held tightly to his daughter. His words &quot;I bear no ill will. I bear no grudge&quot; were reported worldwide, becoming among the most-remembered quotations from the Troubles. Whereas IRA attacks in Northern Ireland often resulted in reprisals by loyalists, Wilson&#x27;s calls for forgiveness and reconciliation came to be called the &quot;Spirit of Enniskillen&quot;.

As a peace campaigner, Wilson held many meetings with members of Sinn Féin. He also met once with representatives of the Provisional IRA. Wilson sought to understand the reasons for the Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen. He also held talks with loyalist paramilitaries in an attempt to persuade them to abandon violence.

==Bombing==
On 8 November 1987, Enniskillen held its annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony to honour those who had served in the British Armed Forces. The Provisional IRA had planted a bomb in the town&#x27;s Reading Rooms behind the cenotaph. It was timed to go off at 10:43am just before the ceremony was due to start. The explosion killed 11 people and injured 64; the last victim died after lying in a coma for 13 years.

The blast buried Wilson and his daughter, Marie, in rubble. Unable to move, he held her hand and comforted her as she lay dying, her last words were, &quot;Daddy, I love you very much&quot;. Five minutes later rescuers pulled Wilson and his daughter out from under the collapsed building. Marie never regained consciousness and died later in hospital.

The BBC would later describe the bombing as a turning point in the Troubles because the attack shook the IRA &quot;to its core&quot;. Pivotal to the change in attitude towards this sort of attack was Wilson&#x27;s reaction to the death of his daughter. The 60-year-old draper publicly forgave those who had planted the bomb and said he would pray for them. He also begged that no-one take revenge for Marie&#x27;s death and pleaded with loyalists not to do so.

On Remembrance Day 1997, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams formally apologised for the bombing.

==Peace campaigner==
===Mediator===
William Ury wrote in his 1999 book &quot;The Third Side&quot;:
He contacted senior members of the IRA following the bombings which killed two boys in Warrington, England in 1993. Despite his begging them to stop, the IRA issued a statement offering &quot;sincerest condolences and apologies&quot; for his daughter&#x27;s death. Wilson said his efforts had been &quot;quite pointless&quot;; he also noted that some Protestants never forgave him for meeting the IRA.

=== Spirit of Enniskillen Trust ===
In 1989 Wilson helped launch a community outreach programme entitled the Spirit of Enniskillen Trust which helped young people in Northern Ireland participate in international undertakings. The Trust gave bursaries to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland. &quot;The idea was to encourage young people aged between 16 and 19 from Northern Ireland to travel outside the Province and to use their experience to help build community bridges at home&quot;. The Trust closed in 2013 due to financial problems.

===Senator===
In 1993, Wilson was named by Albert Reynolds as a Taoiseach&#x27;s nominee to the Seanad. He served until his death in 1995.

==Personal life==
William Gordon Wilson was born in the town of Manorhamilton in County Leitrim in the Irish Free State on 25 September 1927, a few years after the partition of Ireland. His parents, George Wilson and Henrietta Conn, had married in 1926. Wilson was the eldest of four children, had a happy childhood in a strongly Methodist household, with his three sisters Joan, Wilma and Dorothy. Educated at Wesley College, Dublin, Wilson was a man of strong Christian faith and attended Enniskillen Methodist Church. He spent most of his adult life running the family drapery shop in High Street, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.

==Death==
Wilson died of a heart attack in 1995, aged 67, just a few months after the death of his son, Peter, in a road accident. He was survived by his wife, Joan, and their daughter Julie-Anne. His wife, Joan Wilson, died on 31 March 2023. 

==Legacy==
People who had met Wilson in the course of his peace work have described him as one of the most inspiring and caring men they had ever met.

Wesley College Dublin, where Wilson went to school as a teenager, renamed their library to the Gordon Wilson Library after his death. His widow was present at the ceremony.

<doc id="735508" wikidata="Q1388466" url="?curid=735508" title="FIDE World Chess Championship 2004">
<text>The FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 was held at the Almahary Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, from June 18 to July 13, 2004.

It was won by Rustam Kasimdzhanov, who beat Michael Adams in the final by a score of 4½–3½. He won about US$100,000 and the title of FIDE World Chess Champion.

The intention was that the tournament winner would play the world&#x27;s top-ranked player at the time, Garry Kasparov, in a step towards the reunification of the World Chess Championship (which had been split into two separate titles since the World Chess Championship 1993); that match, however, never took place.
==Reunification of the title==

===Pre-tournament===
Ever since 1993, when Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke away from chess governing body FIDE to play their world championship match under the auspices of the newly formed Professional Chess Association, there had been two chess world championships: one organised by FIDE (which used the knock-out format from 1998 to 2004) and one by a variety of other bodies (in the form of a long match between champion and challenger). The 2004 FIDE Championship was a part of what was, at the time, the most serious attempt yet to reunify the title, the so-called &quot;Prague Agreement&quot;.

The plan under this agreement when it was drawn up in 2002 was that reigning FIDE world champion Ruslan Ponomariov and world number one on the FIDE Elo rating list Garry Kasparov played a match, and that the so-called &quot;classical&quot; world champion Vladimir Kramnik and winner of the 2002 Dortmund tournament (which turned out to be Péter Lékó) played each other. The winners of these two matches would then play one another to produce a unified champion.

The match between Ponomariov and Kasparov, however, fell through after FIDE refused to alter various things in the contract on Ponomariov&#x27;s request, and he refused to sign. FIDE announced that instead the winner of the next FIDE knock-out championship played against Kasparov in a match to be held not later than July 2005 (Kramnik and Lékó played their match in September–October 2004). Therefore, as well as the championship determining who was to be the next FIDE world champion, it would also determine who played Kasparov in what was effectively a semifinal match for the unified championship.

===Post-tournament===
After Kasimdzhanov&#x27;s victory, FIDE opened the bidding for the Kasimdzhanov-Kasparov match in August 2004, bids to be received by September 15. This deadline was later extended to September 25. The organiser was to be chosen at the FIDE Presidential Board meeting in October 2004, but in fact, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov announced ahead of this time that the match had been awarded to the United Arab Emirates.

The plan did not come to fruition: the promised funding for the match never arrived, and plans to hold the match instead in Turkey also came to nothing. The whole question of how and when the Kasparov-Kasimdzhanov match would take place, or what would occur in its stead, was made irrelevant by Kasparov&#x27;s announcement in March 2005 that he was retiring from serious chess.

Kasimdzhanov&#x27;s victory did, however, earn him (and runner-up Michael Adams) an invitation to the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005. Kasimdzhanov also gained automatic entry to the Candidates Tournament for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007.

The world championship was eventually reunified in 2006, when classical champion Kramnik defeated the winner of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005, Veselin Topalov.

==Controversies==
The event attracted many controversies.

===Format===
One source of criticism, in common with when it has been used for previous FIDE championships, has been the event&#x27;s format. In particular, the relatively quick time controls have been controversial. (90 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 15 minutes until the end of the game and an incremental time of 30 seconds per move from move one.) Zhang Zhong, for example, was quoted as saying &quot;the time limit is too fast for such a world championship. We should call it a World Cup … a world championship needs more classic time controls&quot; and Nigel Short claimed that &quot;If you took the top 100 players and survey their opinion you would probably find around 75% are against this time control&quot;.

Another criticism centered on the knockout format of the tournament. Although knockout matches had been used prior to the introduction of this tournament format, the brevity of these matches (Best of 2 elimination matches with a Best of 6 Championship Match, as opposed to the Best of 10 elimination matches and Best of 24 Championship Match seen in earlier cycles) led many to consider them to be of little value in determining the better player.

===Location===
Perhaps the greatest criticism concerned the choice of Libya as venue. Claims of human rights abuses, and state-sponsored terrorism caused some consternation, but on a more practical level the country&#x27;s history of not allowing entry to citizens of Israel has been of some concern, as three Israeli players (Boris Gelfand, Emil Sutovsky and Ilya Smirin) had either qualified for the championships or were high on the list of reserves (in the event of qualifiers choosing not to play). Additionally, a number of players had joint Israeli and American citizenship, and so were also expected to be disallowed entry.

With this in mind, FIDE originally announced that a parallel event in Malta would be held alongside the one in Tripoli to ensure that Israeli players could take part—Sutovsky sent his entry form back on the condition he played in Malta. This parallel event was cancelled, however, following a press release from the Libyan authorities that &quot;The Great Socialist People&#x27;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya will pleasantly provide entry visas to all the qualified participants of this great Championship&quot;, which was taken by most (including FIDE) to mean that all players, including Israelis, would be welcome to take part. This appeared to be contradicted by a statement from Mohammed Qadhafi, chairman of the Libyan Olympic Committee (FIDE is affiliated with the IOC) and son of Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, that &quot;We [the Libyans] did not and will not invite the Zionist enemy to this championship.&quot;

Several prominent figures criticized FIDE over this matter, with both Grandmaster Boris Gulko, a Jew with joint American and Israeli citizenship, and Beatriz Marinello, president of the United States Chess Federation writing open letters to FIDE criticizing their handling of the issue.

On May 13, the Anti-Defamation League wrote to FIDE, saying it was &quot;troubling&quot; that Libya should be hosting the championships, and urging FIDE to ensure that Israeli players were treated equally. The letter raised concerns over the Libyans not allowing the coaches and families of Israeli players into the country. Similar concerns were expressed in an Association of Chess Professionals (ACP) open letter of May 26 (the ACP also criticized several other aspects of the tournament&#x27;s organization).

FIDE maintained throughout that Israeli players would have been issued with visas upon their arrival in Libya. This assurance was never put to the test, however: none of the qualified players took part in the championship and Boris Gulko, who has joint American and Israeli citizenship, withdrew from the event after initially indicating he would play (fellow Americans Alexander Shabalov and Alexander Onischuk also withdrew in sympathy with the concerns of Gulko and others). The only player in the final list of participants with an Israeli passport—Vadim Milov, representing Switzerland—never travelled to Libya: he complained that his official invitation to the event had arrived so late (on the day of the opening ceremony, one day before the first game) that it was physically impossible for him to get to Libya with it in time. Milov claims that this constituted a deliberate attempt by FIDE to exclude him. In response, FIDE said that the delay in sending Milov&#x27;s invitation was due to Milov not sending them his passport details until a deadline had passed, and that even with this delay, Milov could still have arrived in Tripoli in time for his first game, which they had offered to postpone if necessary. Milov took his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Tribunal Arbitral de Sport) in Lausanne which found that FIDE &quot;undertook extraordinary efforts to make sure that Claimant [Milov] could participate in the WCC 2004 although such efforts could and should have been made earlier&quot; and ultimately cleared FIDE of any ill-intentioned effort to exclude Milov, concluding &quot;there is no ground for Claimant to claim damages from Respondent.&quot; Milov later responded to this decision in an open letter.

It was also reported that the Israeli chess federation was considering suing FIDE &quot;for compensation for the damages incurred by our exclusion from this tournament&quot;.

===Strength===
As a result of these and other factors, many of the players who were invited to take part in the tournament – including world number two Viswanathan Anand, and number six Peter Svidler – declined. In addition, Kasparov, Kramnik and Lékó did not take part owing to them being involved at a later stage of the reunification process. This led to a somewhat weaker lineup than previous championships, with only three of the world&#x27;s top ten accepting the invitation to play, and only two of those actually turning up to the event. This weakness has itself been a cause of controversy, with claims that any tournament with so many top players missing should not be considered a World Championship at all.

==List of participants==
On May 28, FIDE published a list of participants in the championship which was billed as &quot;final&quot;. However, changes were made following the withdrawal of Gulko, Shabalov and Onischuk. A later &quot;final&quot; list included players of a range of skills from Veselin Topalov (rated 2737 and number five in the world on the FIDE Elo rating list) down to Tarik Abulhul (rated just 2076). It included only three of the world&#x27;s top ten.

Four of these players — Morozevich, Milov, Shulman and Hjartarson — did not appear for their first round matches and were defaulted.

==Rounds 1–4==
The tournament was played in the knock-out format which had become standard for FIDE championships in recent years. Rounds 1–5 consisted of two-game mini-matches; round six (the semi-finals) of four-game matches, and the final of a six-game match. These games were all played with a time control of 1 hour 30 minutes, plus an extra 15 minutes at move 40, and an increment of 30 seconds per move, starting with move one.

If the score at the end of a match was tied, tie-break games would be played. First, two games at a time control of 25 minutes for the whole game plus ten seconds increment per move. If the score was still tied, another two games would be played at a time control of five minutes with a ten-second increment per move. If the score was still tied after these four extra games, a single game of Armageddon Chess would be played where White had six minutes and Black had five, with no increment; White must win the game whereas Black only needed to draw.

All standard time control games began at 2:30 pm local time. Tie breaks began at 8:30 pm on the day of the last standard game, apart from tie-breaks for the semifinals which were played on 2:30 pm the day after the last standard game, and for the final which would be at 12:30 pm the day after the last standard game.

The Chief Arbiter for the tournament was Panagiotis Nikolopoulos.

The games of round one were played on June 19 and June 20, with tie-breaks on the evening of June 20. Four of the sixty-four scheduled round one matches games did not take place at all: Morozevich, Milov, Shulman and Hjartarson all failed to appear for their first game; their opponents (Elarbi, Neelotpal, Tkachiev and Kudrin) progressed into round two by default. Top seed Topalov had problems with his flight into Libya, and the start of his first game had to be postponed until 5 pm. The seeding system in operation, whereby the top seed plays the bottom seed, the number 2 plays number 127, number 3 plays number 126 and so on, meant that serious round one upsets were unlikely, and indeed there were few surprises. Several of the top players, among them Ye (seeded 12), Azmaiparashvili (14) and Rublevsky (17) required the first pair of tie-break games to advance, and Vallejo Pons (21) only went through after the two five-minute games, but in the end, all progressed as expected. The biggest first-round upset in terms of rating difference was Kritz (rated 2534 and seeded 105) knocking out Sasikiran (2659 / 24) by winning both standard games. Apart from the defaults, he and Hamdouchi (who beat Motylev) were the only players to overcome a rating difference of more than 100 points to advance to round two.

The games of round two were played on June 21 and June 22, with tie-breaks on the evening of June 22. Round two saw one major upset and a number of smaller ones. The big surprise was Nigel Short (6) being knocked out by Michał Krasenkow (59). In game one, Short (with white) had the advantage of rook for knight and pawn and was trying to squeeze a win out of it when, after around five hours of play, the position in the diagram arose. Short played the blunder 121.Re6, and resigned a move later. He obtained a slight advantage in game two, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to win, and the draw knocked him out of the competition. Other upsets included Sokolov (9) losing out to Kharlov (73), Malakhov (7) being knocked out by Domínguez (58) in the last tie-breaker and Azmaiparashvili (14) losing to Lastin (51). Most of the top players had little difficulty, however: Topalov (1), Adams (3), Grischuk (4), Nisipeanu (8), and Dreev (10) all progressed after the first two games. Ivanchuk (5) required tie-breakers, but still advanced to round three as expected.

The games of round three were played on June 23 and June 24, with tie-breaks on the evening of June 24. The surprise of round three was Ivanchuk (5) being knocked out by Kasimdzhanov (28). The two standard time control games had been fairly quiet affairs and were both drawn (the second, with Kasimdzhanov white, after just 16 moves) and the first rapid game was also drawn. In the second, Ivanchuk, despite having white, did little to press for a win, and the fairly level position shown arose. 21. Bxb7 Qxb7 appears to be equal, but Ivanchuk instead played 21.Rc1, which simply lost a pawn to 21...Qxa3. Ivanchuk resigned six moves later, in a position which was certainly worse but from which many players would have at least tried to play on. Ivanchuk has something of a reputation for being let down by his nerves, and this may have been another instance of that. Elsewhere, there were minor surprises when Krasenkow (59) followed up on his victory over Short to eliminate Zvjaginsev (27), 16-year-old Nakamura (83) – the youngest player remaining in the tournament – dispatched Lastin (51), and Grischuk (4) required the blitz tie-breakers to see off Filippov (36). Kozul&#x27;s (49) win over Rublevsky (17) took his score for the event to 5½/6, with a Performance rating of over 3000. Top seeds Topalov (1) and Adams (3) advanced with little difficulty, winning their games with white and drawing with black.

After a rest day on June 25, the games of round four were played on June 26 and June 27, with tie-breaks on the evening of June 27. Two surprise results occurred when Kharlov (73) and Domínguez continued their impressive runs by knocking out Nisipeanu (8) and Dreev (10), respectively, both recording their second win against a top 10 player in the tournament.

==Rounds 5–6==

The quarterfinals were played on June 28 and June 29, with tie-breaks on the evening of June 29.

In game one of round five, every game ended in a win for white. Top seeds Topalov (who had won every game apart from one draw going into this round) and Adams won as expected, but the other two wins were slight upsets. Radjabov lost to Dominguez after a complicated opening after which white emerged with three connected passed pawns for a bishop, and Grischuk lost to Kasimdzhanov in an exchange Ruy Lopez. In the position shown in the diagram, which appears to be better for Black, Grischuk slipped up with 46...Bc2? allowing 47.Ne6+. This forks the king and bishop on c5, so 47...Rxe6 is , but this deflects the rook from defence of d7, allowing 48.R3d7+ Kb6 49.Rb8+, a skewer which picks up the rook on b2. Grischuk fought on before resigning on move 73. The match Radjabov-Dominguez ended 3½–3½ with Radjabov only advancing by virtue of drawing with black in the final Armageddon tie-breaker.

After a rest day on June 30, the semifinals were played on July 1, 2, 3 and 4, with tie-breaks on July 5.

The first game of Kasimdzhanov-Topalov was a Queen&#x27;s Gambit which was drawn after just fifteen moves in a position that has occurred in Grandmaster play several times before. Kasimdzhanov did not press for a win, despite having the advantage of the white pieces. He followed a similar strategy in his match against Ivanchuk, possibly in the belief that if he could draw the standard time control games, he would have better chances in rapid and blitz.

Radjabov-Adams game one was more eventful. Radjabov went for the Catalan Opening and Adams introduced a new idea in the position shown with 9...Nb6 10.Qe2 Na5 to hold on to his extra c-pawn (in the past, 9...Nxc3 10.bxc3 b5 had been played). Radjabov was unable to do much with any compensation he may have had, and eventually Adams was left a clean pawn up. He successfully converted this into a win to go 1–0 up. In game two, Adams played the Rossolimo to Radjabov&#x27;s Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5). Neither player obtained a significant advantage and a draw was agreed after White&#x27;s 17th move.

Topalov-Kasimdzhanov game two looked for a while like it would become more interesting. Kasimdzhanov played the Kan Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6) and Topalov opted for a Maróczy Bind-type structure with 5.c4. In response, Kasimdzhanov set up a hedgehog (with pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6) and pushed his h-pawn to h3 to soften up Topalov&#x27;s king side. In an unclear position, moves were repeated, and a draw was agreed after move 25. Game three was harder-fought. From a Sicilian Defence, Topalov gained control of the open c-file and invaded the White position, while Kasimdzhanov obtained some king-side pressure. Topalov&#x27;s position appeared preferable, but he was unable to turn his advantage into anything solid and, with both players becoming short of time, Kasimdzhanov won a pawn. Topalov appeared to have everything under control, however, and, by using his king actively, ensured that White could make no progress. A draw was agreed on move 63.

Radjabov-Adams game three was a Scotch Opening in which Radjabov appeared to build up a powerful attack. He may have missed a good chance to win with 26.Rf7. Instead a draw was agreed on move 27. This left Radjabov needing a win in game four to take the match to tie-breaks, a difficult feat when playing black against a 2700+ rated player. From the beginning of 2002 to this game, Adams had lost only one game with white in a normal time control game (against Alexei Shirov in Reykjavík 2003). Faced with such a tough task, Radjabov played an extremely unusual opening: the Gunderam Defence, 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Qe7 Adams played solidly, however, and never had a worse position. The game was drawn in 44 moves, putting Adams into the final.

Topalov-Kasimdzhanov game four was a Bogo-Indian. Neither side seemed to have much of an advantage for most of the game, and when things simplified to a queen and knight endgame, it seemed a draw would result. Topalov played on, however, and managed to win a couple of pawns. In the end, though, Kasimdzhanov did manage to hold the draw with a perpetual check. This meant that rapid tie-breaks were required to decide the match. To the surprise of most, Kasimdzhanov won both games fairly quickly and went through to the final.

==The final==

The final was to be contested between Michael Adams of England and Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan. Adams&#x27; presence in the final was no surprise to most: he had been a member of the chess elite for some years, and chess statistician Jeff Sonas, for example, reckoned him to have a 10 to 1 chance of winning before the tournament. Kasimdzhanov, on the other hand, was never expected to get this far (Sonas giving him just a 150–1 chance of winning), and although he had achieved some decent results in the past, he remained a largely unknown player. The two had met just three times previously: in a rapid game in Cannes in 2001, in the Bundesliga in 2002, and in Wijk aan Zee in 2002. All three games had been drawn.

The final was played on July 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12, with a rest day on July 9 and tie-breaks on July 13. In the end, Kasimdzhanov beat Adams 4½–3½ after the rapid tie-breaks, the match having been tied 3-3 after the six standard games. At number 28 seed, his victory came as somewhat of a surprise to most of the chess world.

===Regular games===

====Game 1: Adams–Kasimdzhanov, ½–½==== 
Game one, in which Adams had white, saw the Kan Variation of the Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6). Kasimdzhanov quite early, and a quick draw was agreed.


====Game 2: Kasimdzhanov–Adams, 1–0====

In game two, Adams played the Petrov Defence. His knight ended up somewhat out of the game on a5, and his e5 square was weak, allowing Kasimdzhanov to plant a knight there and obtain a significant positional advantage. Both players blundered on the last move of the time control (after which they each got an extra 15 minutes): in the position shown, Kasimdzhanov played 40.Kf2? which Adams should have answered with 40...Nxb5 which is at least equal; instead, he returned the favour with 40...Rc8?, and White was still significantly better. Following 41.Rb1 g5 42.b6 axb6 43.axb6 gxf4 44.gxf4 Bd5 45.Bd3, a similar thing happened when Adams blundered with 45...Rf8? This pins the f4 pawn to the king and so seems to leave the e5 knight undefended, and it was probably for this reason that Kasimdzhanov played 46.Ke3? However, he could have won immediately with 46.Rxc5! when 46...Rxe5 does not work because of 47.Rc7+ when Black must either break the pin with 47...Kf6 or 47...Rf7 48.Rxf7 Kxf7 thus allowing fxe5; or else be mated with 47...Kg8 48.Rg1+ Kh8 49.Rxh7 or 47...Kh8 48.Rxh7+ Kg8 49.Rg1+ Rg5 50.Rxg5#. 46...Ne6 is also no good after 47.Rxd5 Nxf4 48.Rd7 Rxd7 49.Nxd7 Nxd3+ 50.Ke3. In the event, Adams did not take advantage of White&#x27;s mistake, and continued with 46...Nc6? (46...Ne6 was a much better try). The game ended 47.Rxc5 Nxe5 48.fxe5 Bb7 49.Be4 Rff7 50.Bxb7 Rxb7 51.Ke4 Rfd7 52.Rc6 Kf8 53.e6 Rd2 54.Rf1+ Ke8 55.Rc8+ and Adams resigned.

====Game 3: Adams–Kasimdzhanov, 1–0====

Game three was another Kan Sicilian, but Adams varied from game one early with 5.Nc3 instead of 5.Bd3. His 10.Qd2 in reply to 9...Bc5 was a new move (previously, 10.e5, which Adams had himself played in his win against Topalov at Tilburg in 1998, was normal): this may be planning 11.Qg5 which would prompt a weakening ...g6; if black defends with 10...f6, for example, then White can play 11.b4 when 11...Bxb4 (11...Bd6 may be better) 12.Nxb5 leaves White with a strong position. Kasimdzhanov instead retreated with 10...Be7, losing a tempo, and he never managed to equalise. Adams&#x27; pieces ended up being much more active than their black counterparts, and he eventually planted a strong knight on b5 and a rook on the seventh rank. Adams won a pawn, but turning that into a win did not seem straightforward until Kasimdzhanov played 30...Rd6?! in the position shown. This allowed Adams to make simplifying exchanges with 31.Rxb4 axb4 32.Ne7+ Qxe7 33.Qxd6. Now exchanging queens leaves a fairly trivially won rook endgame, so Kasimdzhanov instead played 33...Qe2, but this lost another pawn after 34.Rd4 h5 35.Qxb4, and White had a won position. Kasimdzhanov resigned on move 47, making the match level at 1½–1½.
====Game 4: Kasimdzhanov–Adams, 1–0====

After losing with the Petrov in game two, Adams instead played his usual 2...Nc6. Kasimdzhanov played the exchange variation of the Ruy Lopez, as he had against Grischuk in round five, and they followed theory until Adams&#x27; novelty 12...f5. White exchanged pieces and played against Black&#x27;s weakened queenside, a typical plan in this variation. Adams came under considerable pressure, but it seemed he may be able to hold White off until, in the diagrammed position, he apparently tired of passive defence, and lashed out with 30...Rxa5? (30...Ke7 is probably better), which after 31.bxa5 Rxa5 32.f4! Bxf4 33.Rg6 Kf7 34.Rxe6 Kxe6 35.Bxf4 left him with just two weak pawns for a bishop. Adams resigned on move 40.


====Game 5: Adams–Kasimdzhanov, 1–0====
====Game 6: Kasimdzhanov–Adams, ½–½====

A pawn down, Adams was happy to take the draw with 42...Bxf2+ 43.Kxf2 Qc2+, when White has no way to escape the perpetual check. In fact, though, Adams could have won with 42...Qe4! when there is no satisfactory way to escape the mate threat 43...Be5+ 44.f4 Qxf4+ 45.Kg2 Qg3+ 46.Kf1 Qf3+ 47.Kg1 Bd4+ 48.Kh2 Qf2+ 49.Kh1 Qg1#. If White gives his king a flight square on f2 with 43.f3, then he gets mated by 43...Qe1+ 44.Kg4 Qg1+ 45.Kf4 e5+ 46.Ke4 Qe3+ 47.Kd5 Qxf3#; 43.Qxh7+ also leaves White doomed after 43...Kf8: for example, 44.Qh6+ Bg7 45.Qh4 Be5+ 46.f4 Qe1+ 47.Kg4 Qe2+ 48.Kg3 Bc3, and white has no defence to ...Be1; or 44.Qd7 Be5+ 45.f4 Bxf4+ (more simply, something like 45...Qxf4+ 46.Kg2 Qxg5+ 47.Kf2 Qg3+ 48.Ke2 Qg2+ 49.Kd1 Qxa2 also wins) 46.Kf2 Be3+ 47.Kf1 Qf3+ 48.Ke1 Qf2+ 49.Kd1 Qf1+ 50.Kc2 Qc1+ 51.Kb3 Qc4+ 52.Kb2 Bd4+ 53.Kb1 Qd3+ 54.Kc1 Be3+, and White loses his queen (with mate soon to follow).

<doc id="735510" wikidata="Q2548910" url="?curid=735510" title="Wapsipinicon River">
<text>The Wapsipinicon River (, locally known as the Wapsi) is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately long, starting near the southeastern border of Minnesota and running through northeastern Iowa in the United States. It drains a rural farming region of rolling hills and bluffs north of Waterloo and Cedar Rapids.

==Course==
It rises in Mower County, Minnesota and enters Iowa in northern Mitchell County. It flows generally southeast across rural Chickasaw, Bremer, and Buchanan counties, past Independence and Anamosa. Along its lower it turns east, forming the boundary between Clinton and Scott counties. It joins the Mississippi from the west approximately southwest of Clinton.

It defines the western boundary of the Driftless Area. While the Wapsi has a soft, recent catchment, the Driftless, to the east and north, tumbles down to the Mississippi in rugged canyons.

==Name==
The name of the river in the Ojibwe language is &quot;Waabiziipiniikaan-ziibi&quot; (&quot;river abundant in swan-potatoes&quot;), on account of the large quantity of arrowheads or wild artichokes, known as &quot;swan-potatoes&quot; (&quot;waabiziipiniin&quot;, singular &quot;waabiziipin&quot;), once found near its banks. Severe flooding on the river in 1993, as part of the larger floods in region, caused widespread damage to the surrounding cropland.

==Cities==

The Wapsipinicon River runs alongside the Iowa cities and communities of McIntire, Riceville, Deerfield, Elma, Frederika, Tripoli, Littleton, Otterville, Independence, Quasqueton, Troy Mills, Paris, Central City, Waubeek, Stone City, Anamosa, Olin, Oxford Junction, Oxford Mills, Massillon, Toronto, Wheatland, McCausland, Folletts, and Shaffton before emptying into the Mississippi River. Cedar Rock State Park is located on the Wapsipinicon near Quasqueton. Wapsipinicon State Park is located along its southern bank at Anamosa. Many regional parks also border the river.

==Fishing==
The Wapsipinicon is known for excellent fishing for catfish, although it also contains abundant northern pike, carp, sunfish, and walleye (in some areas).

<text>Potassium–argon dating, abbreviated K–Ar dating, is a radiometric dating method used in geochronology and archaeology. It is based on the measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium (K) into argon (Ar). Potassium is a common element in many materials, such as feldspars, micas, clay minerals, tephra, and evaporites. In these materials, the decay product can escape the liquid (molten) rock but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies (recrystallizes). The amount of argon sublimation that occurs is a function of the sample&#x27;s purity, the composition of the mother material, and several other factors. These factors introduce error limits on the upper and lower bounds of dating so that the final determination of age is reliant on the environmental factors during formation, melting, and exposure to decreased pressure or open air. Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of accumulated to the amount of remaining. The long half-life of allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years.

The quickly cooled lavas that make nearly ideal samples for K–Ar dating also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field as the sample cooled past the Curie temperature of iron. The geomagnetic polarity time scale was calibrated largely using K–Ar dating.

==Decay series==

Potassium naturally occurs in 3 isotopes: (93.2581%), (0.0117%), (6.7302%). and are stable. The isotope is radioactive; it decays with a half-life of to  and . Conversion to stable occurs via electron emission (beta decay) in 89.3% of decay events. Conversion to stable occurs via electron capture in the remaining 10.7% of decay events.

Argon, being a noble gas, is a minor component of most rock samples of geochronological interest: It does not bind with other atoms in a crystal lattice. When decays to ; the atom typically remains trapped within the lattice because it is larger than the spaces between the other atoms in a mineral crystal. However, it can escape into the surrounding region when the right conditions are met, such as changes in pressure or temperature. atoms can diffuse through and escape from molten magma because most crystals have melted, and the atoms are no longer trapped. Entrained argon – diffused argon that fails to escape from the magma – may again become trapped in crystals when magma cools to become solid rock again. After the recrystallization of magma, more will decay and will again accumulate, along with the entrained argon atoms, trapped in the mineral crystals. Measurement of the quantity of atoms are used to compute the amount of time that has passed since a rock sample has solidified.

Despite being the favored daughter nuclide, it is rarely useful in dating because calcium is so common in the crust, with being the most abundant isotope. Thus, the amount of calcium originally present is unknown and can vary enough to confound measurements of the small increases produced by radioactive decay.

==Formula==
The ratio of the amount of to that of is directly related to the time elapsed since the rock was cool enough to trap the Ar by the equation:
:formula_1,
Where:
* &quot;t&quot; is time elapsed
* &quot;t&quot;1/2 is the half-life of 
* Kf is the amount of remaining in the sample
* Arf is the amount of found in the sample.

The scale factor 0.109 corrects for the unmeasured fraction of which decayed into ; the sum of the measured and the scaled amount of gives the amount of which was present at the beginning of the elapsed period. In practice, each of these values may be expressed as a proportion of the total potassium present, as only relative, not absolute, quantities are required.

==Obtaining the data==
To obtain the content ratio of isotopes to in a rock or mineral, the amount of Ar is measured by mass spectrometry of the gases released when a rock sample is volatilized in a vacuum. The potassium is quantified by flame photometry or atomic absorption spectroscopy.

The amount of is rarely measured directly. Rather, the more common is measured and that quantity is then multiplied by the accepted ratio of / (i.e., 0.0117%/93.2581%, see above).

The amount of is also measured to assess how much of the total argon is atmospheric in origin.

== Assumptions ==
According to , the following assumptions must be true for computed dates to be accepted as representing the true age of the rock:

* The parent nuclide, , decays at a rate independent of its physical state and is not affected by differences in pressure or temperature. This is a well-founded major assumption, common to all dating methods based on radioactive decay. Although changes in the electron capture partial decay constant for possibly may occur at high pressures, theoretical calculations indicate that for pressures experienced within a body the size of the Earth, the effects are negligibly small.
* The / ratio in nature is constant so the is rarely measured directly, but is assumed to be 0.0117% of the total potassium. Unless some other process is active at the time of cooling, this is a very good assumption for terrestrial samples.
* The radiogenic argon measured in a sample was produced by in situ decay of in the interval since the rock crystallized or was recrystallized. Violations of this assumption are not uncommon. Well-known examples of incorporation of extraneous include chilled glassy deep-sea basalts that have not completely outgassed preexisting *, and the physical contamination of magma by the inclusion of older xenolitic material. The Ar–Ar dating method was developed to measure the presence of extraneous argon.
* Great care is needed to avoid contamination of samples by absorption of non-radiogenic from the atmosphere. The equation may be corrected by subtracting from the measured value of the amount present in the air where is 295.5 times more plentiful than . decayed = measured − 295.5 × measured.
* The sample must have remained a closed system since the event was dated. Thus, there should have been no loss or gain of or *, other than by radioactive decay of . Departures from this assumption are quite common, particularly in areas of complex geological history, but such departures can provide useful information that is of value in elucidating thermal histories. A deficiency of in a sample of a known age can indicate a full or partial melt in the thermal history of the area. Reliability in the dating of a geological feature is increased by sampling disparate areas which have been subjected to slightly different thermal histories.

Both flame photometry and mass spectrometry are destructive tests, so particular care is needed to ensure that the aliquots used are truly representative of the sample. Ar–Ar dating is a similar technique that compares isotopic ratios from the same portion of the sample to avoid this problem.

==Applications==

Due to the long half-life of , the technique is most applicable for dating minerals and rocks over 100,000 years old. For shorter timescales, it is unlikely that enough will have had time to accumulate to be accurately measurable. K–Ar dating was instrumental in developing the geomagnetic polarity time scale. Although it finds the most utility in geological applications, it plays an important role in archaeology. One archeological application has been bracketing the age of archeological deposits at Olduvai Gorge by dating lava flows above and below the deposits. It has also been indispensable in other early East African sites with a history of volcanic activity such as Hadar, Ethiopia. The K–Ar method continues to have utility in dating clay mineral diagenesis. In 2017, the successful dating of illite formed by weathering was reported. This finding indirectly led to the dating of the strandflat of Western Norway from where the illite was sampled. Clay minerals are less than 2 μm thick and cannot easily be irradiated for Ar–Ar analysis because Ar recoils from the crystal lattice.

In 2013, the K–Ar method was used by the Mars Curiosity rover to date a rock on the Martian surface, the first time a rock has been dated from its mineral ingredients while situated on another planet.

<text>Tuckahoe is a census-designated place (CDP) unincorporated community located within Upper Township in Cape May County of New Jersey.

==History==
The tuckahoe plant was pounded into pulp by local Native Americans and used for cooking and baking, as flour, which served as an ingredient in their cornbread.

Since the tuckahoe was found in great abundance in this area, members of various Lenape tribes would visit this location to collect them.

A bridge, constructed in 1926 and renovated in 1961, connects Tuckahoe to Corbin City, its neighbor to the north. It is also the headquarters for the Cape May Seashore Lines Railroad.

Tuckahoe is named after the wild tuckahoe, which is the sclerotium of the fungus &quot;Wolfiporia extensa&quot; and sometimes also called Indian Bread, which grew in abundance in this area on the roots of certain trees and was collected by the members of the Lenape tribes in the area.

==Roads==
Tuckahoe Road, which has its beginnings in Cross Keys, New Jersey at Route 42, provides access to Ocean City at the northern edge of Cape May County and other shore points as an alternative route to the Atlantic City Expressway.

==Education==
As with other parts of Upper Township, the area is zoned to Upper Township School District (for grades K-8), which sends students to Ocean City High School for grades 9-12.

Countywide schools include Cape May County Technical High School and Cape May County Special Services School District.

<text>Hidalgo is a state in central Mexico divided into 84 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, Hidalgo is the 16th most populous state with inhabitants and the 26th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Hidalgo are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population in Hidalgo is Pachuca, with 314,331 residents, and the smallest is Eloxochitlán with 2,593 residents. The largest municipality by area in Hidalgo is Zimapán, which spans , while Tlahuelilpan is the smallest at . The first municipality to incorporate was Huichapan on , and the newest municipality is Progreso de Obregón which incorporated .

The republic borders Perm Krai to the north, Sverdlovsk Oblast to the northeast, Chelyabinsk Oblast to the east, Orenburg Oblast to the south, Tatarstan to the west and Udmurtia to the northwest. It covers . It is the seventh-most populous federal subject in Russia and the most populous republic. Its capital and largest city is Ufa. As of 2025, it has a population of 4,046,094.

Bashkortostan was established on . On 20 March 1919, it was transformed into the Bashkir ASSR, the first autonomous republic in the Russian SFSR. On 11 October 1990, it adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty. In the Constitution of Bashkortostan and Constitution of Russia, Bashkortostan is defined as a state.

== Terminology ==

The name &quot;Bashkortostan&quot; derives from the name of the Bashkir ethnic group. While the endonym having various theories on its meaning, the most prominent is being a combination of Turkic words &quot;baş&quot;, meaning &#x27;head&#x27;, &#x27;chief&#x27;, &#x27;main&#x27;, &#x27;principal&#x27; and &quot;qurt&quot; meaning &#x27;wolf&#x27;, one of the animals regarded as sacred to Turkic peoples); the suffix -stan is Persian, commonly used for many Eurasian territorial names. Bashkirs speak the Bashkir language, which belongs to the Kipchak branch of the Turkic language group.

== History ==

The first settlements in the territory of modern Bashkortostan date from the early Paleolithic period, but the Bronze Age spurred an upsurge in the population of this territory. When people of the Abashevo culture started settling here, they possessed high skills in manufacturing bronze tools, weapons and decorations. They were the first to establish permanent settlements in the Southern Urals.

Bashkortostan takes its name from its native people, the Bashkirs. The Slavonic name of the country, Bashkiriya, formed at the end of the 16th century. Originally it appeared in the forms &quot;Bashkir land&quot;, &quot;Bashkir&quot;, &quot;Bashkirda&quot; and &quot;Bashkir horde&quot;. The ethnonym &quot;Bashkirs&quot; first became known in the 7th century. In the 10th century, Al-Balkhi wrote about Bashkirs as a people, divided into two groups, one of which inhabited the Southern Urals, while the other lived near the Danube River, close to the boundaries of Byzantium. His contemporary Ibn-Ruste described the Bashkirs as &quot;an independent people, occupying territories on both sides of the Ural mountain ridge between Volga, Kama, Tobol and upstream of Yaik River&quot;.
After the early-feudal Mongolian state had broken down in the 14th century, the territory of modern Bashkortostan became divided between the Kazan, the Siberia Khanates and the Nogai Horde. The tribes that lived there were headed by &quot;bi&quot; (tribal heads). After Kazan fell to Ivan the Terrible in 1554–1555, representatives of western and northwestern Bashkir tribes approached the Tsar with a request to voluntarily join Muscovy. The Bashkir rebellion of 1662–1664 and the Bashkir rebellion of 1704–1711 were primarily caused by the Russian government&#x27;s violations of the terms and conditions previously agreed between the Bashkirs and the Russian authorities. Bashkirs were also largely involved in the Pugachev Rebellion (their leader Salawat Yulayev, currently considered a national hero of the Bashkirs, was one of Pugachev&#x27;s closest aides). 

Starting from the second half of the 16th century, Bashkiria&#x27;s territory began taking shape as a part of the Russian state. In 1798, the Spiritual Assembly of Russian Muslims was established, an indication that the tsarist government recognized the rights of Bashkirs, Tatars, and other Muslim nations to profess Islam and perform religious rituals. Ufa Governorate (), with a center in Ufa, was formed in 1865—another step toward territorial identification.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917 were the All-Bashkir Qoroltays (conventions), which required a decision on the need to create a national federal republic within Russia. As a result, on 28 November 1917, the Bashkir Regional (Central) Shuro (Council) proclaimed the establishment of territorial and national autonomy in areas of Orenburg, Perm, Samara, and Ufa provinces with a predominantly Bashkir population.

In December 1917, delegates to the All-Bashkir (constituent) Congress, representing the interests of the population edge of all nationalities, voted unanimously for the resolution (Farman #2) of the Bashkir regional Shuro for the proclamation of national-territorial autonomy (of the Republic) Bashkurdistan. The congress formed the government of Bashkurdistan, the Pre-parliament—Kese-Qoroltay and other bodies of power and administration, and decisions were made on how to proceed.

In March 1919, based on the agreements of the Russian Government, the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed. During the Soviet period, Bashkiria was granted broad autonomous rights, the first among other Russian regions. The administrative structure of the Bashkir ASSR was based on principles similar to those of other autonomous republics of Russia.

On 11 October 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Republic adopted the declaration on state sovereignty of the Bashkir ASSR. On 25 February 1992, the Bashkir ASSR was renamed the Republic of Bashkortostan.

On 31 March 1992, a Federative Compact &quot;On separation of authorities and powers among federal organs of power of the Russian Federation and the organs of power of the Republic of Bashkortostan&quot; was signed. On 3 August 1994, a Compact &quot;On separation of authorities and mutual delegating of powers among the organs of power of the Russian Federation and the organs of power of the Republic of Bashkortostan&quot; was signed, granting the republic autonomy. This agreement was unilaterally abolished on 7 July 2005.

<text>Osbert Salvin (25 February 1835 – 1 June 1898) was an English naturalist, ornithologist, and herpetologist best known for co-authoring &quot;Biologia Centrali-Americana&quot; (1879–1915) with Frederick DuCane Godman. This was a 52-volume encyclopedia on the natural history of Central America.

==Biography==
Osbert Salvin was born in Finchley, north London, the second son of the architect Anthony Salvin, of Hawksfold, Sussex. He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, taking his degree in 1857. Shortly afterwards he accompanied his second cousin by marriage, Henry Baker Tristram, in a natural history exploration of Tunisia and eastern Algeria. Their account of this trip was published in &quot;The Ibis&quot; in 1859 and 1860.

In the autumn of 1857, he made the first of several visits to Guatemala, returning there with Frederick DuCane Godman in 1861. It was during this journey that the &quot;Biologia Centrali-Americana&quot; was planned.

In 1871 Salvin became editor of &quot;The Ibis&quot;. He was appointed to the Strickland Curatorship in the University of Cambridge, and produced his &quot;Catalogue of the Strickland Collection&quot;. He was one of the original members of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union. He produced the volumes on the &quot;Trochilidae&quot; and the &quot;Procellariidae&quot; in the &quot;Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum&quot;. One of his last works was the completion of Lord Lilford&#x27;s &quot;Coloured Figures of British Birds&quot; (1897).
Salvin was a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Linnean, Zoological and Entomological Societies, and at the time of his death was Secretary of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union.

The Godman-Salvin Medal, a prestigious award of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union, is named after him and Godman.

In the scientific field of herpetology, he described two new species of Central American reptiles: &quot;Bothriechis aurifer&quot; and &quot;Typhlops tenuis&quot;. Also, three species and one subspecies of reptiles have been named in his honor: &quot;Anolis salvini&quot;, &quot;Crotalus scutulatus salvini&quot;, &quot;Sceloporus salvini&quot;, and &quot;Staurotypus salvinii&quot;.

==Family==
In 1863, he married Caroline Octavia Maitland in Loughton, Essex. They had three daughters, Sybil Maitland Salvin (born 1867), who married Edmund Leveson Calverley in 1893, Heloise Salvin (born 1875) and Viola Salvin (born 1878). Heloise Salvin married biologist John Edmund Sharrock Moore.
Osbert&#x27;s grandson is Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu, a Theravada Buddhist monk and translator of Pali literature; he was originally also named Osbert after his grandfather.

<text>Ms. is an American feminist magazine co-founded in 1971 by journalist and social/political activist Gloria Steinem. It was the first national American feminist magazine. The original editors were Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Mary Thom, Patricia Carbine, Joanne Edgar, Nina Finkelstein, Mary Peacock, Margaret Sloan-Hunter, and Gloria Steinem. Beginning as a one-off insert in &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 1971, the first stand-alone issue of &quot;Ms.&quot; appeared in January 1972, with funding from &quot;New York&quot; editor Clay Felker. It was intended to appeal to a wide audience and featured articles about a variety of issues related to women and feminism. From July 1972 until 1987, it was published on a monthly basis. It now publishes quarterly.

At its peak in the 1970s, &quot;Ms.&quot; enjoyed great success but was not always able to reconcile its ideological concerns with commercial considerations. Since 2001, the magazine has been published by the Feminist Majority Foundation, based in Los Angeles and Arlington, Virginia.

==From 1971 to 1987==

=== The first cover of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine ===
The preview issue of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine was published in December 1971 by &quot;New York&quot; magazine. The cover, illustrated by Miriam Wosk, depicts a pregnant version of the Hindu goddess Kali using eight arms to hold a clock, skillet, typewriter, rake, mirror, telephone, steering wheel, and an iron. 300,000 test copies of the magazine sold out in three days, and generated 26,000 subscription orders within the next few weeks. Steinem advocated for this cover as she liked the imagery of a woman juggling multiple facets of life, something that &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine would focus on. Additionally, the cover displays a Hindu goddess to convey messages of neutrality and female universality.

=== Origins and creation ===
&quot;Ms.&quot; was viewed as a voice for women by women, a voice that had been hidden from and left out of mainstream media. The magazine&#x27;s first publication as an independent issue included articles about women who had experience with abortions, promoting the removal of sexist wording from the English language, and literature focused on helping women realize they could stand up for themselves against social norms.

Co-founder Gloria Steinem explained the motivation for starting &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, stating: &quot;I realized as a journalist that there really was nothing for women to read that was controlled by women, and this caused me along with a number of other women to start &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine.&quot; Steinem wanted a publication that would address issues that modern women cared about instead of just domestic topics such as fashion and housekeeping. Steinem originally wanted &quot;Ms.&quot; to be a newsletter but was convinced to make it into a magazine by her peers. Patricia Carbine thought a magazine was better because of the money from advertisers and that it could reach their audience with its portable, visually pleasing, easy format. The creators of &quot;Ms.&quot; expected there to be significant participation of the general public as well as readers. For example, the first issue published in 1972 included a feature titled &quot;We have had abortions&quot;, a list of famous women acknowledging that they have gone through this particular medical operation. The feature had a coupon for readers to include their own names as part of this list. In addition, readers frequently interacted with the magazine through sending in letters to the editors about the personal importance of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine.

As to the origin of the name chosen for the magazine, she has stated: &quot;We were going to call it &quot;Sojourner&quot;, after Sojourner Truth, but that was perceived as a travel magazine. Then we were going to call it &quot;Sisters&quot;, but that was seen as a religious magazine. We settled on &quot;Ms.&quot; because it was symbolic, and also, it was short, which is good for a logo.&quot; &quot;Lilith&quot; and &quot;Bimbo&quot; were considered titles for the magazine as well. At this time, the honorific &quot;Ms.&quot;, an alternative to &quot;Miss&quot; or &quot;Mrs.&quot; that neutralizes a women&#x27;s marital status, was being promoted by Sheila Michaels but not yet well known or defined by the media. In particular, when Michaels suggested the use of &quot;Ms.&quot; in 1969, in a lull during a WBAI-radio interview with &quot;The Feminists&quot; group, a friend of Steinem heard the interview and suggested it as a title for her new magazine.

=== Wonder Woman cover ===
Gloria Steinem placed Wonder Woman, in costume, on the cover of the first independently published issue of &quot;Ms.&quot; v1 #1, July 1972 (Warner Communications, DC Comics&#x27; owner, was an investor), which also contained an appreciative essay about the character. Steinem was offended that the world&#x27;s most famous female superhero had had her powers removed in the most recently published comics. The progressive author wrote two issues of the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; comic book in 1972, during this controversial period in the publication&#x27;s history when the lead character abandoned her superpowers and became a secret agent. Delany was initially supposed to write a six-issue story arc that would culminate in a battle over an abortion clinic, but the story arc was canceled after Steinem led a lobbying effort protesting the removal of Wonder Woman&#x27;s powers, a change predating Delany&#x27;s involvement. Scholar Ann Matsuuchi concluded that Steinem&#x27;s feedback was &quot;conveniently used as an excuse&quot; by DC management. Wonder Woman&#x27;s powers and traditional costume were restored in issue #204 (January–February 1973).

Joanne Edgar wrote the cover story for the 1972 issue with Wonder Woman. She described her personal relationship with comic books and applied issues women were facing such as power dynamics and gender discrimination at the work place to the character.

&quot;Ms.&quot; featured Wonder Woman on the cover of their magazine in 1972 with the title &quot;Wonder Woman For President&quot;. Steinem wanted to lobby DC comics to display Wonder Woman as a feminist hero because she felt that new images of Wonder Woman in the 1960s objectified her. By including Wonder Woman on the cover of &quot;Ms.&quot;, Steinem was able to encourage Dick Giordano to reinstate Wonder Woman&#x27;s truth lasso, bracelets, and her origin story.

The &quot;Ms.&quot; cover wanted to embrace the traits of compassion that Wonder Woman had as well as her belief in justice. Tim Hanley, a comic historian, commented on how the &quot;Ms.&quot; cover, emphasized unity and &quot;sisterhood&quot;. While some women were in support of Wonder Woman being an icon of second-wave feminism, others critiqued &quot;Ms.&quot; for displaying a woman with &quot;superhuman&quot; or unachievable qualities. However, the &quot;Ms.&quot; editors were worried about featuring actual female public figures on their covers early on due to their worry of tokenizing them as the symbol of the feminist movement.

Jill Lepore reflected on &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine&#x27;s cover with Wonder Woman by calling it the connection between first-wave feminism and second-wave feminism. Wonder Woman was inspired by the efforts of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and by the work of women in the Great Depression.

===Editorial content===

&quot;The Housewife&#x27;s Moment of Truth&quot;, the first cover story for &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, was written by Jane O&#x27;Reilly. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s article spoke for feminist strength and the opposition against the repression of wives in society and the home. The article also helped introduce the idea of &quot;click!&quot;, or the realization a woman acquires when she realizes the demands being pushed upon her to act, work and behave in a certain way can be fought against.

In 1972, &quot;Ms.&quot; published the names of 53 women who admitted to having had abortions when the procedure was illegal in most states of the country. The &quot;Ms.&quot; petition included a tear-out section for women to remove, sign and send back to the magazine. The tear-out section stated:

Signatories included Billie Jean King, Judy Collins, Anaïs Nin, Gloria Steinem, Susan Sontag, and Nora Ephron. The petition drew on evidence that around 25% of American women had chosen to have an abortion, despite its variable legal status. Called the American Women&#x27;s Petition, the &quot;Ms.&quot; petition was inspired by the Manifesto of the 343 that had been published the previous year in which 343 French women publicly declared that they had had an abortion, which was also illegal in France at the time. In 1973, the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision by the Supreme Court of the United States would legalize abortion throughout the country.

The petition was the inspiration for a similar campaign by &quot;Ms.&quot; in 2006, as well as an amicus brief signed by more than 100 American lawyers in support of overturning the abortion regulations at issue in Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt.

The January 1973 edition featured Shirley Chisholm and Sissy Farenthold on the cover with the title: &quot;The Ticket That Might Have Been.&quot;From 1974 to 1977, &quot;Ms.&quot; collaborated with public broadcasting and, with the help of a grant from the Corporation for Public Funding, produced the television series &quot;Woman Alive!&quot;. The show was formatted to reflect the magazine, and consisted of short documentaries made by independent women filmmakers, interviews, and entertainment segments.

A 1976 cover story on battered women made &quot;Ms.&quot; the first national magazine to address the issue of domestic violence. The cover photo featured a woman with a bruised face.

From 1972 until 1988, Suzanne Braun Levine served as editor of &quot;Ms.&quot;

In conjunction with other efforts towards feminist language reform, &quot;Ms.&quot; challenged the common holiday phrase &quot;Peace on earth, good will to men&quot; by changing the salutation to &quot;Peace on earth, good will to people.&quot; In its earliest years, the magazine&#x27;s December cover proclaimed this altered holiday message in bold, colorful designs by Brazilian designer Bea Feitler, as well as in editorial addresses from Steinem.

Over its long history, the magazine has featured articles written by and about many women and men at the forefront of business, politics, activism, and journalism. The magazine&#x27;s investigative journalism broke several landmark stories on topics including overseas sweatshops, sex trafficking, the wage gap, the glass ceiling, date rape, and domestic violence.

The type of feminist that &quot;Ms.&quot; attracted is most often labeled as a &quot;cultural&quot; feminist, those interested in changing the deep rooted gender norms within American culture. &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine editors represented this background as they did not identify as women in politics or political feminists; rather, they were activists, writers, and graduates of all women&#x27;s colleges. Though the editors represented a small fraction of feminists in the 1970s, &quot;Ms.&quot; strove to represent the term &quot;female universality&quot;, a phrase that encompassed representation of all women no matter their socio-economic status, race, religion, or political beliefs.

==Since 1987==
In 1987, &quot;Ms.&quot; was bought by Fairfax, an Australian media company, which appointed the head of its US arm, Sandra Yates, to oversee the magazine&#x27;s editorial and financial turnaround. In 1989, concerned about a perceived &quot;Cher cover&quot;-centered editorial direction under Anne Summers, American Feminists bought it back and began publishing the magazine without ads.

Robin Morgan and Marcia Ann Gillespie served respective terms as Editors in Chief of the magazine. Gillespie was the first African-American woman to lead &quot;Ms.&quot; For a period, the magazine was published by MacDonald Communications Corp., which also published &quot;Working Woman&quot; and &quot;Working Mother&quot; magazines. Known since its inception for unique feminist analysis of current events, &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1991 change to an ad-free format also made it known for exposing the control that many advertisers assert over content in women&#x27;s magazines.

In 1998, Gloria Steinem, Marcia Ann Gillespie and a group of female investors created Liberty Media (not the cable/satellite conglomerate of the same name) and brought the magazine under independent ownership. It remained ad-free and won several awards, including an Utne award for social commentary. With Liberty Media facing bankruptcy in November 2001, the Feminist Majority Foundation purchased the magazine, dismissed the staff, and moved the editorial headquarters from New York to Los Angeles. Formerly bimonthly, the magazine has since published quarterly.

In 2005, under editor-in-chief Elaine Lafferty, &quot;Ms.&quot; was nominated for a National Magazine Award for Martha Mendoza&#x27;s article &quot;Between a Woman and Her Doctor&quot;. Despite this success, Lafferty left the magazine after only two years following various disagreements including the editorial direction on a cover story on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, and a perceived generation gap towards third-wave feminists and grunge.

===Later editorial content===
Another &quot;We Had Abortions&quot; petition appeared in the October 2006 issue as part of the issue&#x27;s cover story. This time, the petition contained signatures of more than 5,000 women declaring that they had had an abortion and were &quot;unashamed of (the) decision&quot;, including actresses Amy Brenneman and Kathy Najimy, comedian Carol Leifer, and Steinem herself.

In 2017, &quot;Ms.&quot; celebrated its 45th anniversary of publication. In honor of this event, &quot;Ms.&quot; made a reference to their very first issue in 1972 that featured Wonder Woman on the cover. This choice was based on Wonder Woman&#x27;s belief in &quot;sisterhood and equality&quot;, something &quot;Ms.&quot; states is a &quot;driving value&quot; for feminist beliefs not only when the magazine first began, but in today&#x27;s society.

== &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine and women of color ==

=== &quot;Ms.&quot; and black women ===
Steinem, herself, was inspired by many women of color throughout her career in activism. Most notably, Steinem worked with Flo Kennedy and Shirley Chisholm for advocating for women&#x27;s rights. Steinem founded &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine with Dorothy Pitman Hughes, who was involved in child-welfare activism as well as the Civil Rights Movement. In 1973, &quot;Ms.&quot; featured a cover of Shirley Chisholm titled as &quot;The Ticket That Might Have Been…&quot;. At the same time, &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine was also criticized for the lack of diversity displayed in its content, especially towards the end of their era of influence in the late 1980s. In 1986, author Alice Walker, a contributor to &quot;Ms.&quot;, resigned, citing the lack of diversity on the magazine&#x27;s covers and its limited features of women of color. Walker had previously written an article in 1975 titled &quot;In Search of Zora Neale Hurston&quot;, which was credited to have created new interests in Black female writers. The editors of &quot;Ms.&quot; admit, as they reflect back on their influence in the 1970s, that their publications were perceived as &quot;elitist&quot; at times due to their staff but the content was always meant to be inclusive. In 1975, &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine had a cover of Pam Grier and in 1979 they had Michelle Wallace on the cover. Though &quot;Ms.&quot; did feature covers of Black women, magazines such as &quot;Essence&quot; created during a similar time period focused more on Black female empowerment. There has been no association found between Black feminist media organizations such as the Kitchen Table Press and the Combahee River Collective with &quot;Ms.&quot;

From 1993 to 2001, during Marcia Ann Gillespie&#x27;s tenure, the voices and perspectives of women of color and inclusion of diverse feminists and opinions dramatically increased. 

As of 2020, &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine has features and columns that highlight the work of Black women. For example, Janell Hobson, a Ms. Scholar, works on the &quot;Black Feminist in Public&quot; series highlighting intersectionality in the media.

=== &quot;Ms.&quot; and Indigenous women ===
Steinem was greatly influenced by the activism of Wilma Mankiller, a member of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Mankiller joined the board of Ms. Foundation for Women in 1973 and was awarded the title of Woman of Year by &quot;Ms.&quot; in 1987. Steinem and Mankiller were friends, advisors, and colleagues. Mankiller focused on indigenous women&#x27;s rights and collaborated with Steinem on this issue as well. The magazine&#x27;s coverage of issues affecting the indigenous community has increased over the last couple of years. For example, &quot;Ms.&quot; covered the passage of legislation to protect indigenous women such as the Savannah Act and the Not Invisible Act.

== Advertising policy == 

On January 10, 2008, the American Jewish Congress released an official statement which was critical of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine&#x27;s refusal to accept from them a full-page advertisement honoring three prominent Israeli women: Dorit Beinisch (president of the Supreme Court of Israel), Tzipi Livni (Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel), and Dalia Itzik (speaker of the Knesset).

The New York &quot;Jewish Week&quot; reported that a number of Jewish feminists, including Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance founder Blu Greenberg, were mostly disappointed with the decision by &quot;Ms.&quot; to reject the ad.

However, Katherine Spillar, executive editor of &quot;Ms.&quot;, responded to these criticisms on the magazine&#x27;s website, rejecting claims of anti-Israel bias. She argued that the proposed advertisement was inconsistent with the magazine&#x27;s policy to accept only &quot;mission-driven advertisements from primarily non-profit, non-partisan organizations&quot;, suggesting that the advertisement could have been perceived &quot;as favoring certain political parties within Israel over other parties, but also with its slogan &#x27;This is Israel&#x27;, the ad implied that women in Israel hold equal positions of power with men&quot;. Spillar stated that the magazine had &quot;covered the Israeli feminist movement and women leaders in Israel ... eleven times&#x27; in its last four years of issues&quot;.

<doc id="735553" wikidata="Q45997" url="?curid=735553" title="Paul Johnson (writer)">
<text>Paul Bede Johnson (2 November 1928 – 12 January 2023) was a British journalist, popular historian, speechwriter and author. Although associated with the political left in his early career, he became a popular conservative historian.

Johnson was educated at the Jesuit independent school Stonyhurst College, and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied history. He first came to prominence in the 1950s as a journalist writing for and later editing the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine. A prolific writer, Johnson wrote more than 50 books and contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers. His sons include the journalist Daniel Johnson, founder of &quot;Standpoint&quot; magazine, and the businessman Luke Johnson, former chairman of Channel 4.

== Early life and career ==
Johnson was born in Manchester. His father, William Aloysius Johnson, was an artist and principal of the Art School in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. At Stonyhurst College, Johnson received an education grounded in the Jesuit method, which he preferred over the more secularised curriculum of Oxford. While at Oxford, Johnson was tutored by the historian A. J. P. Taylor, and was a member of the exclusive Stubbs Society. After graduating with a second-class honours degree, Johnson performed his national service in the Army, joining the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps and then the Royal Army Educational Corps, where he was commissioned as a captain (acting) based mainly in Gibraltar. Here he saw the &quot;grim misery and cruelty of the Franco regime&quot;.

Johnson&#x27;s military record helped the Paris periodical &quot;Réalités&quot; hire him, where he was assistant editor from 1952 to 1955. Johnson adopted a left-wing political outlook during this period as he witnessed in May 1952 the police response to a riot in Paris (Communists were rioting over the visit of American general, Matthew Ridgway, who commanded the US Eighth Army during the Korean War; he had just been appointed NATO&#x27;s Supreme Commander in Europe), the &quot;ferocity [of which] I would not have believed had I not seen it with my own eyes.&quot; Then he served as the &quot;New Statesman&quot;″s Paris correspondent. For a time, he was a convinced Bevanite and an associate of Aneurin Bevan himself. Moving back to London in 1955, Johnson joined the &quot;Statesman&quot;″s staff.

Some of Johnson&#x27;s writing already showed signs of iconoclasm. His first book, about the Suez War, appeared in 1957. An anonymous commentator in &quot;The Spectator&quot; wrote that &quot;one of his [Johnson&#x27;s] remarks about Mr Gaitskell is quite as damaging as anything he has to say about Sir Anthony Eden&quot;, but the Labour Party&#x27;s opposition to the Suez intervention led Johnson to assert &quot;the old militant spirit of the party was back&quot;. The following year, he attacked Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond novel &quot;Dr No&quot;. In 1964, he warned of &quot;The Menace of Beatlism&quot;, in an article contemporarily described as being &quot;rather exaggerated&quot; by Henry Fairlie in &quot;The Spectator&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; mocked Johnson&#x27;s novel &quot;Merrie England&quot; (1964):

Johnson was successively lead writer, deputy editor and editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; from 1965 to 1970. He was found suspect for his attendances at the soirées of Lady Antonia Fraser, who was at the time married to a Conservative MP. There was some resistance to Johnson&#x27;s appointment as &quot;New Statesman&quot; editor, not least from the writer Leonard Woolf, who objected to a Catholic filling the position, and Johnson was placed on six months&#x27; probation. &quot;Statesmen and Nations&quot; (1971), the anthology of his &quot;Statesman&quot; articles, contains numerous reviews of biographies of conservative politicians and an openness to continental Europe; in one article, Johnson took a positive view of events of May 1968 in Paris, leading Colin Welch in &quot;The Spectator&quot; to accuse Johnson of possessing &quot;a taste for violence&quot;. According to this book, Johnson filed 54 overseas reports during his &quot;Statesman&quot; years.

== Shift rightward ==
During the late 1970s, Johnson began writing articles in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; attacking trade unions in particular, and leftism in general. Slightly later, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; may have repudiated this, when it published an article criticising him, in a series of articles &quot;Windbags of the West&quot; about various right-wing journalists. Johnson served on the Royal Commission on the Press (1974–1977) and was a member of the Cable Authority (regulator) from 1984 to 1990. From 1981 to 2009, he wrote a column for &quot;The Spectator&quot;; initially focusing on media developments, it subsequently acquired the title &quot;And Another Thing&quot;. In his journalism, Johnson generally dealt with issues and events that he saw as indicative of a general social decline, whether in art, education, religious observance, or personal conduct. He continued to contribute to the magazine, although less frequently than before. During the same period, he contributed a column to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; until 2001. In a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; interview in November 2003, he criticised the &quot;Mail&quot; for having a pernicious impact: &quot;I came to the conclusion that that kind of journalism is bad for the country, bad for society, bad for the newspaper.&quot;

Johnson was a regular contributor to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, mainly as a book reviewer, and in the U.S. wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, and &quot;National Review&quot;. He also contributed to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. For a time in the early 1980s, he wrote for &quot;The Sun&quot; after Rupert Murdoch urged him to &quot;raise its tone a bit&quot;. Johnson was a critic of modernity because of what he saw as its moral relativism, and he objected to those who use Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution to justify their atheism, such as Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker, or use it to promote biotechnological experimentation. As a conservative Catholic, Johnson regarded liberation theology as a heresy and defended clerical celibacy, but departed from others in seeing many good reasons for ordination of women as priests.

Admired by conservatives in the United States and elsewhere, Johnson was strongly anticommunist. He defended Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, finding his cover-up considerably less heinous than Bill Clinton&#x27;s perjury and Oliver North&#x27;s involvement in the Iran–Contra affair. In his &quot;Spectator&quot; column, Johnson defended his friend Jonathan Aitken, and expressed admiration for Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, as well as limited admiration for Spanish fascist dictator Francisco Franco. Johnson was also active in the campaign, led by Norman Lamont, to prevent Pinochet&#x27;s extradition to Spain after his 1998 arrest in London. In 1999, Johnson was reported as saying: &quot;There have been countless attempts to link him to human rights atrocities, but nobody has provided a single scrap of evidence.&quot; In &quot;Heroes&quot; (2008), Johnson returned to his longstanding claim that criticism of Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship on human rights grounds came from &quot;the Soviet Union, whose propaganda machine successfully demonised [Pinochet] among the chattering classes all over the world. It was the last triumph of the KGB before it vanished into history&#x27;s dustbin.&quot;

Johnson described France as &quot;a republic run by bureaucratic and party elites, whose errors are dealt with by strikes, street riots and blockades&quot; rather than a democracy. Johnson was a Eurosceptic who played a prominent role in the &quot;No&quot; campaign during the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EC. In 2010 Johnson noted that &quot;you can&#x27;t have a common currency without a common financial policy, and you can&#x27;t have that without a common government. The three things are interconnected. So this [European integration] was entirely foreseeable. Not much careful thought and judgment goes into the EU. It&#x27;s entirely run by bureaucrats.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Paul Johnson was married from 1958 to the psychotherapist and former Labour Party parliamentary candidate Marigold Hunt, daughter of Thomas Hunt, physician to Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee, and Anthony Eden. They had three sons and a daughter: the journalist Daniel Johnson, a freelance writer, editor of &quot;Standpoint&quot; magazine, and previously associate editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;; Luke Johnson, businessman and former chairman of Channel 4 Television; Sophie Johnson-Clark, an independent television executive; and Cosmo Johnson, playwright. Paul and Marigold Johnson have ten grandchildren. Marigold Johnson&#x27;s sister, Sarah, married the journalist, former diplomat, and politician George Walden; their daughter, Celia Walden, is married to television presenter and former newspaper editor Piers Morgan.

In 1998, it was revealed Johnson had an affair lasting eleven years with Gloria Stewart, a freelance journalist, who recorded them together in his study &quot;at the behest of a British tabloid&quot;; she first claimed to have made the affair public because she objected to Johnson&#x27;s hypocrisy about religion and family values, but later acknowledged that their affair had ended when Johnson &quot;found another girlfriend&quot;. Johnson was an avid watercolourist. He was also a friend of playwright Tom Stoppard, who dedicated his 1978 play &quot;Night and Day&quot; to him. Johnson died at his home in London on 12 January 2023, at the age of 94.

==Honours==
In 2006, Johnson was honoured with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President George W. Bush. Johnson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to literature.

<text>Florian Schneider-Esleben (7 April 194721 April 2020) was a German musician. He is best known as one of the founding members and leaders of the electronic band Kraftwerk, performing his role with the band until his departure in 2008.

==Early life==
Schneider was born on 7 April 1947 in Öhningen, at the time part of the French occupation zone in southern Germany, near the Bodensee, in what would become the state of Baden-Württemberg in 1952. His parents were Paul Schneider-Esleben, an architect, and his wife Evamaria (&quot;née&quot; van Diemen-Meyerhof). Schneider was Jewish on his mother&#x27;s side; Paul married the half-Jewish Evamaria in 1946 against the will of his father, who remained a loyal Nazi. Schneider&#x27;s family moved to Düsseldorf when he was three years old.

==Career==
Schneider founded Kraftwerk with Ralf Hütter in 1970. They met in 1968 while studying at the Academy of Arts in Remscheid, then at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in Düsseldorf, playing improvisational music together in the ensemble Organisation. Before meeting Hütter, Schneider had played with Eberhard Kranemann in the group Pissoff from 1967 to 1968. From 1968 to 1969, Schneider played flute, with Hütter on Hammond organ, Kranemann on bass and Paul Lovens on drums.

Originally, Schneider&#x27;s main instrument was the flute, which he would treat using electronic effects, including tape echo, ring modulation, pitch-to-voltage converters, fuzz and wah-wah, allowing him to use his flute as a bass instrument. He also played violin (similarly treated), electric guitar (including slide guitar), and made use of synthesizers (both as a melodic instrument and as a sound processor). Later, he also created his own electronic flute instrument. After the release of Kraftwerk&#x27;s 1974 album, &quot;Autobahn&quot;, his use of acoustic instruments diminished.

Schneider, speaking in 1991, said: &quot;I had studied seriously up to a certain level, then I found it boring; I looked for other things, I found that the flute was too limiting... Soon I bought a microphone, then loudspeakers, then an echo, then a synthesizer. Much later, I threw the flute away; it was a sort of process&quot;. Although he had limited keyboard technique, he apparently preferred to trigger the synth sounds through a keyboard (later, developments in sequencing limited the need for hands-on playing).

Schneider&#x27;s approach was concentrated on sound design (in an interview in 2005, Hütter called him a &quot;sound fetishist&quot;) and vocoding/speech-synthesis. One patented implementation of the latter was christened the Robovox, a distinctive feature of the Kraftwerk sound. Hütter said of Schneider&#x27;s approach:


In 2015, Schneider and Dan Lacksman, with the help of Uwe Schmidt, released an electronic ode, &quot;Stop Plastic Pollution&quot;, for ocean environment conservation as part of the Parley for the Oceans campaign.

===Departure from Kraftwerk===
Schneider did not perform on any of the dates of the Kraftwerk 2008 world tour, with his last performance with the band being in November 2006 in Spain. His position onstage was subsequently filled by Stefan Pfaffe, an associate working for the band as a video technician. According to a close associate of the group, Schneider left Kraftwerk in November 2008. On 6 January 2009, &quot;NME&quot; confirmed Schneider&#x27;s departure.

Reputedly, Schneider&#x27;s departure followed a dispute with Hütter over a bicycle pump, a rumour which some sources describe as unfounded.

==Death==
Schneider died of cancer on 21 April 2020, fourteen days after his 73rd birthday, having suffered from the illness for a short time.

==Legacy==
David Bowie titled an instrumental track, &quot;V-2 Schneider&quot;, on his album &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; after Schneider, and was heavily influenced by Kraftwerk&#x27;s sound during his &quot;Berlin period&quot; in the late 1970s.

Shortly after Schneider&#x27;s death, the bells of the St. Martin&#x27;s Cathedral, Utrecht rang out with the tones of the song &quot;Das Model&quot;.

On 12 May 2021, Kraftwerk was announced as one of the inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<text>Jeremiah Andrew Denton Jr. (July 15, 1924 – March 28, 2014) was an American politician and military officer who served as a U.S. Senator representing Alabama from 1981 to 1987. He was the first Republican to be popularly elected to a Senate seat in Alabama. Denton was previously a United States Navy rear admiral and naval aviator taken captive during the Vietnam War.

Denton was widely known for enduring almost eight years of grueling conditions as an American prisoner of war (POW) in North Vietnam after the A-6 Intruder he was piloting suffered severe damage resulting from a defective bomb, which detonated as he released the weapon(s) in 1965. He was the first of the American POWs released by Hanoi to step off an American plane during Operation Homecoming on February 12, 1973. As one of the earliest and highest-ranking officers to be taken prisoner in North Vietnam, Denton was forced by his captors to participate in a 1966 televised propaganda interview which was broadcast in the United States. While answering questions and feigning trouble with the blinding television lights, Denton blinked his eyes in Morse code, spelling the word &quot;T-O-R-T-U-R-E&quot;—and confirming for the first time to U.S. Naval Intelligence that American POWs were being tortured.

In 1976, Denton wrote &quot;When Hell Was in Session&quot; about his experience in captivity, which was made into the 1979 film with Hal Holbrook. Denton was also the subject of the 2015 documentary &quot;Jeremiah&quot; produced by Alabama Public Television.

In 1980, Denton was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he focused mainly on family issues and national security, helping pass the Adolescent Family Life Act (the so-called &quot;Chastity Bill&quot;) in 1981 and heading the Judiciary Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism.

In 2019, the United States Secretary of the Navy announced that an upcoming guided missile destroyer will be named in Denton&#x27;s honor. Construction on began in August 2022. Additionally, an airport on Dauphin Island was named the Jeremiah Denton Airport in honor of Denton and his service in the military.

==Early life and education==

Denton was born July 15, 1924, in Mobile, Alabama, the oldest of three brothers, and the son of Jeremiah Sr. and Irene (Steele) Denton. He attended McGill–Toolen Catholic High School (Class of 1942) and Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama. His grandmother, Irene Claudia Jackson, was the grand-daughter of Roxana Virginia Hollinger, the daughter of Alexander Hollinger. Alexander Hollinger was the brother-in-law of Congressman George Washington Owen, the first member of Congress elected from Mobile in a district containing Mobile. Alexander Hollinger was the brother of Owen&#x27;s wife Sarah Louise Hollinger.

In June 1943, he entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and graduated three years later in the accelerated Class of 1947 on June 5, 1946, with a Bachelor of Science degree, the same class as future president Jimmy Carter.

== Career ==

His 34-year naval career included service on a variety of ships and on aircraft, including airships. His principal field of endeavor was naval operations. He also served as a test pilot, flight instructor, and commanding officer of an attack squadron flying the A-6 Intruder.

In 1957, he was credited with revolutionizing naval strategy and tactics for nuclear war as architect of the &quot;Haystack Concept.&quot; This strategy called for concealing aircraft carriers from radar by intermingling with commercial shipping and avoiding formations suggestive of a naval fleet. The strategy was simulated in maneuvers and demonstrated effectiveness, allowing two aircraft carrier fleets thirty-five simulated atomic launches before aggressor aircraft and submarines could repel them. He went on to serve on the staff of the Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet at the rank of Commander (O-5) as Fleet Air Defense Officer.

Denton graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College and the Naval War College, where his thesis on international affairs received top honors by earning the prestigious President&#x27;s Award. In 1964, he received the degree of Master of Arts in international affairs from George Washington University&#x27;s School of Public and International Affairs in Washington, D.C.

===Vietnam War===
Denton served as a United States Naval Aviator during the Vietnam War. In February 1965, he became the Prospective Commanding Officer of Attack Squadron Seventy-Five serving aboard aircraft carrier .

On July 18, 1965, Commander Denton was piloting his A-6A Intruder jet (BUNO 151577) while leading a 28-aircraft bombing mission over North Vietnam off the &quot;Independence&quot; which was stationed in the South China Sea. He and LTJG Bill Tschudy, his bombardier/navigator, were forced to eject from their plane, damaged by one of their own Mark 82 bombs exploding shortly after its release after which it went down out of control near the city of Thanh Hoa in North Vietnam. Both men were quickly captured and taken prisoner.

Denton and Tschudy were held as prisoners of war for almost eight years, four of which were spent in solitary confinement. Denton was notable for his leadership during the Hanoi March in July 1966, when he and over 50 American prisoners were paraded through the streets of Hanoi and beaten by North Vietnamese civilians. Denton is best known from this period of his life for the 1966 televised press conference in which he was forced to participate as an American POW by his North Vietnamese captors. He used the opportunity to send a distress message confirming for the first time to the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence and Americans that American POWs were being tortured in North Vietnam. He repeatedly blinked his eyes in Morse code during the interview, spelling out the word &quot;T-O-R-T-U-R-E&quot;. He was also questioned about his support for the U.S. war effort in Vietnam, to which he replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what is happening, but whatever the position of my government is, I support it fully. Whatever the position of my government, I believe in it, yes, sir. I am a member of that government, and it is my job to support it, and I will as long as I live.&quot; While a prisoner, he was promoted to the rank of captain. Denton was later awarded the Navy Cross for heroism and the Purple Heart for wounds incurred while a prisoner of war.
Denton was first sent to the Hỏa Lò Prison, nicknamed the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;, and was later transferred to the Cu Loc Detention Center, nicknamed the &quot;Zoo&quot;. In 1967 he was transferred to a prison nicknamed &quot;Alcatraz&quot;. Here, he became part of a group of American POWs known as the &quot;Alcatraz Gang&quot;. The group consisted of George Coker, Harry Jenkins, Sam Johnson, George McKnight, James Mulligan, Howard Rutledge, Robert Shumaker, James Stockdale (who had graduated with Denton from the Naval Academy), Ronald Storz, and Nels Tanner. They were put in &quot;Alcatraz&quot; and solitary confinement to separate them from other POWs because their strong resistance led other POWs in resisting their captors. &quot;Alcatraz&quot; was a special facility in a courtyard behind the North Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense, located about one mile away from Hoa Lo Prison. Each of the American POWs spent day and night in windowless cells mostly in legcuffs.

On February 12, 1973, both Denton and Tschudy were released in Hanoi by the North Vietnamese along with numerous other American POWs during Operation Homecoming. Stepping off the jet back home in uniform, Denton said: &quot;We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances. We are profoundly grateful to our Commander-in-Chief and to our nation for this day. God bless America.&quot; The speech has a prominent place in the 1987 documentary, &quot;Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam&quot;.

Denton was briefly hospitalized at the Naval Hospital Portsmouth, Virginia, and then was assigned to the Commander, Naval Air Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, from February to December 1973. In January 1974, Denton became the commandant of the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk (now known as the Joint Forces Staff College), to June 1977. His final assignment was as special assistant to the Chief of Naval Education and Training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, from June 1977 until his retirement from the Navy on November 1, 1977 with the rank of Rear Admiral.

===After retirement===
Denton accepted a position with the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) as a consultant to CBN founder and friend, Pat Robertson, from 1978 to 1980. During his time with CBN, both Denton and Robertson repeatedly expressed support for the Contra forces in Nicaragua. In 1981, he founded and chaired the National Forum Foundation. Through his National Forum Foundation, Denton arranged shipments of donated goods to countries in need of aid.

Denton founded the Coalition for Decency, which tried to clean up television by urging boycotts of sponsors that promoted sexual promiscuity.

==Political career==

In 1980, Denton ran as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat from his home state of Alabama, and was supported by Jerry Falwell&#x27;s Moral Majority. In the primary election, he easily defeated former U.S. Congressman Armistead Selden, a Democrat who had switched parties and garnered the support of the Republican establishment in the state. He then achieved a surprise victory with 50.2 percent of the vote in November over Democratic candidate Jim Folsom Jr., who himself had defeated the incumbent, Donald W. Stewart, in the Democratic primary election. In doing so, Denton became the first retired Navy admiral elected to the United States Senate. He was the second retired Navy admiral to serve in the U.S. Senate, as Admiral Thomas C. Hart of Connecticut was appointed to fill a vacant Senate seat and served from November 15, 1945, to November 5, 1946.

He was the first Republican to be popularly elected in Alabama since the direct election of U.S. senators began in 1913, the first Republican senator since Reconstruction to represent Alabama in the U.S. Senate, and the first Catholic to be elected to statewide office in Alabama.

As a senator, Denton was most outspoken on issues related to the regulation of sexual promiscuity and the preservation of the nuclear family, a goal that he sought to pursue through a $30 million bill to push chastity among teenagers. In 1981 he was able to pass the Adolescent Family Life Act (nicknamed the &quot;Chastity Bill&quot;) as a part of the 1981 omnibus.

Denton was also outspoken on national security issues, particularly with regard to the Soviet Union. By the mid-1980s, he told &quot;Time&quot; at the outset of the decade, &quot;We will have less national security than we had proportionately when George Washington&#x27;s troops were walking around barefoot at Valley Forge.&quot; Along with Republican senators Orrin Hatch and John East, Denton set up and later chaired the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism, which focused on communist and Soviet threats. Citing testimonies from journalist Claire Sterling, former CIA director William Colby, neoconservative writer Michael Ledeen and journalist and spy thriller writer Arnaud de Borchgrave, the committee alleged that left-wing activist groups, publications, and think tanks had been infiltrated by Soviet agents of the KGB. Media at the time referred to committee&#x27;s role and its accusations bearing similarity to the Red Scare tactics used by Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1940s and 1950s.

In 1986, Denton narrowly lost his bid for reelection to the U.S. Senate, receiving 49.7 percent of the vote against U.S. Congressman Richard Shelby, a conservative Democrat who later became a Republican.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Denton&#x27;s first wife and the mother of his seven children, the former Kathryn Jane Maury, died after 61 years of marriage. He married Mary Belle Bordone in 2010.

His children included James S. Denton, publisher and editor of &quot;World Affairs&quot; and the director of the World Affairs Institute. In January 2024, Denton&#x27;s grandson, Jeremiah (Jake) A. Denton IV, announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives, Virginia, 2nd District.

Denton died of complications from a heart ailment at a hospice in Virginia Beach on March 28, 2014, at age 89. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery with his wife Jane.

:Prisoner of War in North Vietnam
:Date of Action: February 1966 – May 1966

:Citation:

::The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Rear Admiral [then Commander] Jeremiah Andrew Denton Jr. (NSN: 0-485087), United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism while serving as a Prisoner of War in North Vietnam from February 1966 to May 1966. Under constant pressure from North Vietnamese interrogators and guards, Rear Admiral Denton experienced harassment, intimidation and ruthless treatment in their attempt to gain military information and cooperative participation for propaganda purposes. During this prolonged period of physical and mental agony, he heroically resisted cruelties and continued to promulgate resistance policy and detailed instructions. Forced to attend a press conference with a Japanese correspondent, he blinked out a distress message in Morse Code at the television camera and was understood by United States Naval Intelligence. When this courageous act was reported to the North Vietnamese, he was again subjected to severe brutalities. Displaying extraordinary skill, fearless dedication to duty, and resourcefulness, he reflected great credit upon himself, and upheld the highest traditions of the Naval Service and the United States Armed Forces.

<doc id="735572" wikidata="Q3342057" url="?curid=735572" title="Super Scope 6">
<text>known as Nintendo Scope 6 in Europe and Australia, is a shooter video game developed by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was bundled with the Super Scope for the Super NES. As the name suggests, the cartridge contains six games that require the Super Scope to play.

==Title screen and calibration==

When the player turns on the SNES with the &quot;Super Scope 6&quot; cartridge inserted, they will be presented with a title screen that reads &quot;Super NES Super Scope 6&quot; in red italicized letters across the top of the screen. The bottom is filled with a diagram of the Super Scope and the names of its buttons. The player must shoot the screen to begin the game.

The next screen is the calibration routine required by all &quot;Super Scope&quot; titles. The screen displays a white target with a blue background. The player is instructed to shoot the &quot;bull&#x27;s-eye&quot; of the target. Doing so tells the SNES where the center of the screen is relative to the Super Scope and its interface box. After calibration, the player is asked to test the aim to verify its accuracy. It is not required to shoot the bullseye this time, but it&#x27;s important that the shot mark lines up with where the player aimed and fired though. If the player misses the bullseye during calibration, or if they move the Super Scope or its interface box afterwards, the shots fired in game will not be accurate.

==Choosing a game==
After the calibration routine the player is presented with two options, each of which leads to three of the six games. The option on top is titled Blastris, the bottom option is LazerBlazer.

==Blastris==
If the player fires at the Blastris option, they will be asked to choose among three games: Blastris A, Blastris B, and Mole Patrol. The player selects the desired game by aiming at its box and pressing fire. After selecting the game the bottom half of the screen fills with three option boxes which differ depending on the game selected. There are three difficulty settings for each game (&quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, and &quot;High&quot;), which simply determine the stage that the player starts on.

===Blastris A===

Blastris A is loosely based on the popular Tetris game. It can be played by either one or two players.

The playing field is a box seven rows high and ten columns across. Above the playing field on the right is a box with five darkened lights. Below the playing field is the status bar. The status bar displays the current score, level, and number of shots available.

Various configurations of blocks scroll from left to right and stop upon hitting the wall or another block. Blocks can be destroyed by being shot. The player gets two shots per block that appears; one can choose whether to use them in that block or save them for later. Upon filling a vertical line with blocks, the line disappears and the remaining blocks to the left shift one position to the right. The player must clear five lines in order to progress to the next level. The game ends when any row is filled with ten blocks and reaches the far left side of the screen.

===Blastris B===

Blastris B plays more like Sega&#x27;s &quot;Columns&quot;. Single multi-colored blocks are dropped in random locations, and the player must arrange blocks in rows, columns, or diagonal lines of the same color. Shooting the falling blocks makes them change color. Some blocks&#x27; colors are unchangeable, indicated by their metallic borders and the noise that results from shooting them (a metallic clang).

The player can choose between a stage-based game mode (which involves a set number of blocks on the bottom level that the player must eliminate), or a single nonstop game mode.

===Mole Patrol===

Mole Patrol involves protecting a garden from evil blue moles by shooting them. More points are given based on the player&#x27;s reaction time and accuracy, much like a Whac-A-Mole game.

Mole Patrol involves two modes: Stage Game and Score Game.

*Stage Game divides the game into levels. In each, the player must shoot all of the moles before the time runs out, otherwise the game is over. There are also red moles that, once shot, speed up the clock in the upper-right corner, increasing the speed of the moles, thereby making the task harder (the red moles don&#x27;t count towards the total number of moles per stage). From time to time throughout the game, a mole will appear in the sky, flying on a rocket, presumably from LazerBlazer&#x27;s &quot;Intercept&quot; mode. Shooting it results in bonus points. This mode ends when time runs out.
*Score mode is a single level mode in which the player must shoot the moles in order to gain a higher score at the end of the level. If the player shoots out the moles quickly and without missing any single shot, the score will be higher.

==LazerBlazer==
Selecting the LazerBlazer option allows the player to choose among three separate types: Type A (Intercept), Type B (Engage), and Type C (Confront). The games are presented in three boxes, in a similar fashion to Blastris. A communication screen on the right displays a lady who gives the player instructions. Each game in LazerBlazer consists of 30 levels, and finishing those levels will end the game.

Intercept is the only game in LazerBlazer to allow two players to play three levels in alternating turns. The rest are one player only.

===Type A: Intercept===

In Intercept, the player must shoot down incoming missiles before they reach the opposite side of the screen. The missiles&#x27; distance from the screen sight varies, and the player has to judge the distance, or their shot will pass too late or too early. If the player misses five missiles, the game ends. The player can only shoot three bullets at a time, and it takes some time to refill them.

Mario appears piloting a plane, chased by Lemmy Koopa riding on a rocket, in some one-player game levels or in Level 2 of the two-player game. Hitting Lemmy will either recover a miss or award the player bonus points in the one-player or two-player games, respectively. If the player hits Mario instead, it will count as a miss or those points are void (again, depending on which mode the player is in).

===Type B: Engage===

In Engage, the player shoots down enemy fighters and incoming missiles before the player ship&#x27;s fuel runs out. As in Intercept, the player has to judge the enemies&#x27; speed and distance in order to hit them. If the player gets hit five times or the ship&#x27;s fuel runs out, the game is over. The player can only shoot four bullets at a time, and it takes some time to refill them. When a level finishes, a green ship refills the player&#x27;s ship&#x27;s fuel. Occasionally, a red ship appears. It not only refills fuel, but it can recover one hit point.

===Type C: Confront===

In Confront, the player fights off an incoming invasion of enemy ships. Unlike Intercept or Engage, the player can shoot an infinite number of bullets at any time. When an enemy has not been destroyed for a while, it will attack. When the player has been hit five times, the game is over. During some moments, flashing enemies will appear. Shooting them will recover a hit point.

==Reception==

In Japan, the game topped the &quot;Famitsu&quot; sales chart in June 1993.

<text>Opportunity Knocks is a British television and radio talent show originally hosted by Hughie Green, with a late-1980s revival hosted by Bob Monkhouse, and later by previous winner Les Dawson. From its origin on BBC Radio in 1949 the show provided a platform to fame for acts such as Spike Milligan and Frankie Vaughan. One of the most popular shows on British television, in the 1960s and 1970s it had a weekly audience of 20 million viewers.

The original radio version started on the BBC Light Programme, where it ran from 18 February to 29 September 1949, but moved to Radio Luxembourg in the 1950s. It was shown on ITV from 20 June 1956 to 29 August 1956, produced by Associated Rediffusion. A second run commenced on 11 July 1964 and lasted until 20 March 1978, produced first by ABC and then by Thames. During this period Bob Sharples was musical director. Green presented a single episode of &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; for RTÉ in 1979. It was revived by the BBC (largely in response to ITV&#x27;s similar revival of &quot;New Faces&quot; the preceding year) from 21 March 1987 to 2 June 1990, hosted initially by Monkhouse from 1987 to 1989 (under the title &quot;Bob Says Opportunity Knocks!&quot;) and subsequently by Dawson in 1990. Kiki Dee&#x27;s hit single &quot;Star&quot; became the theme song for the revived BBC series.

==Voting system==
Unlike its rival &quot;New Faces&quot;, the winning acts on &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; were decided not by a panel of experts but by the viewing public. In the ITV version this took the form of a postal vote, the winner of which was announced the following week. The BBC revival was notable for being the first TV show to decide its winner using the now-standard method of a telephone vote. In both versions the studio audience reaction to each act was measured by a clap-o-meter, but this did not count towards the final result.

The programme was recorded the Friday before transmission, so votes had to be in by Thursday. They also, according to host Hughie Green, largely to ensure fairness, had to be in &quot;your own handwriting&quot;.

Although &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; did produce a number of talented acts, the method of putting the contest to a public vote did sometimes result in victories for novelty acts, in particular those involving children or animals. On one occasion, the young Su Pollard was beaten into second place by a singing dog.

==Famous alumni==
Entertainers who appeared included Freddie Starr and the Delmonts, Su Pollard, Paul Daniels, Darren Day, Pete the Plate Spinning Dog, Los Caracas (later to become Middle of the Road), Mary Hopkin, Bonnie Langford, Les Dawson, Maureen Myers, Barry Cummings, Royston Vasey (later to find fame as Roy Chubby Brown), Little and Large, Bobby Crush, Berni Flint, Tony Holland (The Muscle Man), Millican &amp; Nesbitt, Neil Reid, Peters and Lee, Lena Zavaroni, Frank Carson, Max Boyce, Pam Ayres, Juniper Green, Gerry Monroe, Debra Stephenson, Tammy Jones, Paper Lace, Barry and Paul Elliott and Tony Monopoly. Several winners of &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; (notably Tammy Jones, Champagne, Tony Monopoly) later attempted to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest, taking part in the A Song for Europe competition. Lee Evans appeared in 1986 but was rejected and did not make it past the initial audition. Kaz Hawkins appeared in the 1980s&#x27; revival as a child.

==Influence==
Today, most of the elements of this show are visible on the ITV talent search &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, which was created by record company executive Simon Cowell. The method of deciding a winner by telephone is used on that show and many other similar programmes around the world.

A reference to the show can be heard on the Beatles&#x27; first live performance of &quot;Yesterday&quot; at Blackpool Night Out. George Harrison introduces the song, saying &quot;For Paul McCartney of Liverpool, opportunity knocks!&quot;. This version appears on &quot;Anthology 2&quot;.

<text>66 Maja () is a carbonaceous background asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 71 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 9 April 1861, by American astronomer Horace Tuttle at the Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The asteroid was named after Maia from Greek mythology.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Maja&quot; is a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,571 days; semi-major axis of 2.65 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at the Harvard Observatory, one night after its official discovery observation.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the Tholen classification, &quot;Maja&quot; is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid, while in the SMASS classification it is a &quot;hydrated&quot; carbonaceous subtype (Ch).

=== Rotation period and spin axes ===

Several rotational lightcurves of &quot;Maja&quot; have been obtained from photometric observations since 1988. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve by French amateur astronomers Maurice Audejean and Jérôme Caron from February 2011 gave a rotation period of 9.73509 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.25 magnitude ().

In 2016, a modeled lightcurve was derived from various photometric database sources, giving a concurring sidereal period of 9.73570 hours and two spin axes of (49.0°, −70.0°) and (225.0°, −68.0°) in ecliptic coordinates.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Maja&quot; measures between 62.87 and 82.28 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.03 and 0.0759.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0618 and a diameter of 71.82 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.36.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named by Harvard&#x27;s former president, J. Quincy, after Maia, one of the Seven Sisters of the Pleiades in Greek mythology. She is the mother of Hermes (Mercury) and the daughter of Atlas and Pleione. The official naming citation was mentioned in &quot;The Names of the Minor Planets&quot; by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

The asteroids , and were also named after the mythological Seven Sisters. In 1861, the director of the discovering observatory, George Phillips Bond, raised a minor concern since these names had already been applied to some of the brightest stars of the Pleiades in the constellation of Taurus: Maia, Electra, Asterope and Merope.

== Spacecraft visits ==
At present, &quot;Maja&quot; has not been visited by any spacecraft. As of 1988, mission planning for the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft included a flyby of &quot;Maja&quot; while leaving the inner solar system in March 1997, however due to delays, the launch of Cassini-Huygens was moved from April 1996 to October 1997, thus negating the option to pass near &quot;Maja&quot;. Cassini-Huygens passed by asteroid 2685 Masursky on 23 January 2000 instead.

<doc id="735585" wikidata="Q4111238" url="?curid=735585" title="Trask River">
<text>The Trask River is in northwestern Oregon in the United States. It drains a mountainous timber-producing area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range west of Portland into Tillamook Bay and the Pacific Ocean. It is one of five rivers—the Tillamook, the Trask, the Wilson, the Kilchis, and the Miami—that flow into the bay.

The main stem of the river is long from where its two forks join at . The North Fork, long, rises in several forks itself in the Tillamook State Forest in western Washington County, west of Forest Grove, Oregon. It flows generally west into eastern Tillamook County. The South Fork, long, rises in southern Tillamook County at and flows generally northward.

The river is known for its runs of Steelhead and Chinook salmon.

The river is named for Elbridge Trask who settled on the shores of Tillamook Bay in 1848. Trask&#x27;s overland journey was described in the 1960 historical novel &quot;Trask&quot; by Don Berry, as well as two sequels. The novels are collectively known as the &quot;Trask novels.&quot;

==Course==

The Trask River is formed by the confluence of North Fork Trask River and South Fork Trask River near Trask County Park in the Tillamook State Forest. It is paralleled for much of its length by Trask River Road. Flowing generally west, the river receives Rowe Creek from the about from the mouth, then Samson Creek from the about later. Over the next Burton, Blue Ridge, Hatchery, Trowbridge, Little Rock, and Panther creeks all enter from the right. The river passes a United States Geological Survey stream gauge at river mile (RM) 10.95 or river kilometer (RK) 17.62, just before receiving Cedar Creek from the right.

Thereafter, Gold and Hanenkrat creeks enter from the left and Green Creek from the right. The river receives Mill Creek from the left about from the mouth. About later, the stream passes under U.S. Route 101 and flows around the southwestern edge of Tillamook. Receiving Hoquarten and Nolan sloughs from the right, it merges with the Tillamook River and flows into Tillamook Bay near Memaloose Point.

===Discharge===
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitors the flow of the Trask River at a stream gauge inland from the mouth of the river. Based on data collected from April 1996 through 2008, the average flow at this gauge is . This is from a drainage area of , about 89 percent of the total Trask River watershed. The maximum flow recorded there was on November 25, 1999, and the minimum flow was on September 11, 2007.

<text>The Catalogue () is a box set consisting of the eight albums by German electronic music band Kraftwerk that were released from 1974 to 2003. All albums are digitally remastered, with most of the cover art redesigned, including rare photographs in the liner notes that were not part of each album&#x27;s original release.

==Contents and formats==


The albums included in the boxed set are the following:
# &quot;Autobahn&quot; (1974)
# &quot;Radio-Activity&quot; (German title: &quot;Radio-Aktivität&quot;; 1975)
# &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; (German title: &quot;Trans Europa Express&quot;; 1977)
# &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; (German title: &quot;Die Mensch-Maschine&quot;; 1978)
# &quot;Computer World&quot; (German title: &quot;Computerwelt&quot;; 1981)
# &quot;Electric Café&quot; (1986; here given its originally intended name of &quot;Techno Pop&quot;)
# &quot;The Mix&quot; (1991)
# &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot; (2003; now titled &quot;Tour de France&quot;)

Due to licensing issues, three of these albums—&quot;Computer World&quot;, &quot;Electric Cafe&quot; (now re-christened with its original working title of &quot;Techno Pop&quot;) and &quot;The Mix&quot;—are unavailable in the United States except as part of the boxed set (although they can now be found on streaming services such as Spotify). The &quot;Techno Pop&quot; album contains a slightly revised track listing from its predecessor &quot;Electric Cafe&quot;: the song &quot;The Telephone Call&quot; now appears in its much shorter single mix, and that single&#x27;s B-side remix, &quot;House Phone&quot;, has been added as a proper album track. As with previous Kraftwerk releases, the collection is distributed in two versions: English-language vocal tracks for international distribution and another (&quot;Der Katalog&quot;) with German-language vocal tracks. The boxed set contains eight CDs in mini-vinyl card wallet packaging, plus individual large-format booklets. On October 5, 2009, Kraftwerk released several remastered albums with redesigned artwork.

==Release==
The boxed set was initially planned for release in 2004 on compact disc and vinyl format and was distributed as a promotional boxed set on compact disc. Copies were often sold on eBay for high prices. An actual release date was not announced and the project remained unreleased for years, despite having a page on the Kraftwerk website during this time.

The individual remastered albums were eventually made available on compact disc in October 2009, while an 8-CD boxed set and heavyweight vinyl versions followed in November. Due to licensing restrictions imposed by Warner Music Group, the albums &quot;Computer World&quot;, &quot;Techno Pop&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Electric Café&quot;) and &quot;The Mix&quot; have only been made available in the US from Astralwerks Records as a part of the box set, or individually as imports (the iTunes Store also carries the complete remastered catalogue as well). The collection may also be purchased in three different configurations from the group&#x27;s Klingklang Shop; with a T-shirt, with a set of mouse pads or all three items together.

===Proposed second boxed set===
In 2006 Ralf Hütter suggested that a second Kraftwerk boxed set containing the band&#x27;s first three albums would be released but there has been no official news regarding such a project or an amended release date since.
==Reception==
The box set received universal acclaim from critics.

<text>67 Asia is a large main belt asteroid. It was discovered by English astronomer N. R. Pogson on April 17, 1861, from the Madras Observatory. Pogson chose the name to refer both to Asia, a figure in Greek mythology, and to the continent of Asia, because the asteroid was the first to be discovered from that continent.

This object is orbiting the Sun with a period of , a semimajor axis of , and an eccentricity of 0.185. It has a 2:1 commensurability with Mars, having an orbital period double that of the planet. The orbital plane lies at an inclination of 6.0° to the plane of the ecliptic. This is a stony S-type asteroid with a cross-sectional size of 61 km, Photometry from the Oakley Observatory during 2006 produced a lightcurve that indicated a sidereal rotation period of with an amplitude of in magnitude.

<text>John Edward Kenna (April 10, 1848January 11, 1893) was an American politician who was a Senator from West Virginia from 1883 until his death.

==Biography==
Kenna was born in Kanawha County, Virginia (now West Virginia, near the city of St. Albans) and lived his early life at Upper Falls, where his father was lockmaster and owned a sawmill. He had little education, and at the age of 16 he served in the &quot;Iron Brigade&quot; with General Joseph O. Shelby in the Confederate States Army and was wounded. After returning home, he read law and was admitted to the bar in 1870. He became very active in the emerging Democratic Party of West Virginia.

He rose from prosecuting attorney of Kanawha County in 1872 to Justice &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the county circuit in 1875, and to the United States House of Representatives in 1876. While in the House he championed railroad legislation and crusaded for aid for slack-water navigation to help the coal, timber, and salt industries in his state. These activities earned him a seat in the United States Senate in 1883, where he continued fighting for his two causes.

Kenna became Democratic minority leader and emerged as a powerful and controversial speaker on the issue of the independence of the executive branch of the government. He forcefully defended President Grover Cleveland on several issues and indicted the Senate Republican majority for failure to pass tariff reforms. Kenna was a practicing Catholic and member of the congregation at St. Joseph&#x27;s on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. In late April 1891, he successfully argued the Ball v. United States case before the U.S. Supreme Court, which spared the lives of two West Virginians accused of murder in Texas.

Kenna died on January 11, 1893, at the age of 44. He was still in office at the time of his death, and was succeeded by Johnson N. Camden. He had 6 children, including Ed Kenna.

Longtime Washington journalist Benjamin Perley Poore described Kenna as &quot;a tall, thick-set man&quot; who was &quot;negligent in his dress and rather slow in the utterance of his sentences.&quot;

Kenna is the namesake of the town of Kenna, West Virginia. In 1901, the state of West Virginia donated a marble statue of Kenna to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection.

<text>Michoacán is a state in western Mexico that is divided into 113 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it is the ninth most populated state with inhabitants and the 16th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Michoacan are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is Morelia, with 849,053 residents (17.87% of the state&#x27;s total), while the smallest is Zináparo with 3,232 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Arteaga which spans , and the smallest is Aporo with . The newest municipality is José Sixto Verduzco, created on January 25, 1974.

<text>A snakebot, also referred to as a snake robot, is a biomorphic robot that resembles a snake. Snakebots have uses similar to those of certain types of soft robots.

Snakebots can vary significantly in size and design. Their small cross-section-to-length ratios allow them to maneuver through tight spaces. Their ability to change shape allows them to traverse varied terrain.

Snake robots are often designed by connecting multiple independent segments, which provides redundancy and enables continued operation even if some parts are damaged. Snakebots have been posited for a range of practical applications.

A snakebot differs from a snake-arm robot in that, snakebots are usually self-contained, whereas snake-arm robots typically have mechanics remote from the arm itself, possibly connected to a larger system.

==Applications==
By mimicking the locomotion of snakes, snakebots can be used for tasks in multiple industries that traditional robots or human workers may find challenging or impossible to accomplish safely. Snakebots have been considered for the following applications:

* Search and rescue: A snakebot was deployed for search and rescue after the September 2017 earthquake in Mexico City.
* Inspection and maintenance: These robots can also be used for inspecting hard-to-reach areas, such as tubes, pipelines, bridges, and other infrastructure elements.
* Medical applications: In medical technology, miniature versions of Snakebots have been developed for endoscopic and minimally invasive procedures. An example is the medical snakebot developed at Carnegie Mellon University, which is capable of maneuvering around organs inside a human chest cavity.
* Military and surveillance: Due to their quiet, agile movement, snakebots are being considered for reconnaissance and surveillance tasks in military and defense settings.
* Space exploration: Space agencies are exploring the use of snakebots to navigate extraterrestrial terrains, such as the rocky, uneven surfaces of Mars or the Moon, including steep craters. Unlike traditional rovers, which can get stuck on uneven ground, snakebots can adapt to challenging terrains, slithering over rocks or squeezing into crevices to gather data in places otherwise inaccessible. An example is the Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor designed to explore the surface and the oceans of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn.

==Locomotion==
Traditional Snakebots move by changing the shape of their body, similar to actual snakes. Many variants have been created that use wheels or treads for movement. There has yet to be any Snakebots that accurately approximate the locomotion of real snakes. However, researchers have produced new movement methods that do not occur in nature. 

In snakebot research, a gait is a periodic mode of locomotion/movement. Sidewinding and lateral undulation are both examples of gaits. Snakebot gaits are often designed by investigating period changes to the shape of the robot. For example, a caterpillar moves by changing the shape of its body to match a sinusoidal wave. Similarly, a snakebot can move by adapting its shape to different periodic functions.

Sidewinder rattlesnakes can ascend sandy slopes by increasing the portion of their bodies in contact with the sand to match the reduced yielding force of the inclined sand, allowing them to ascend the maximum possible sand slope without slip. Snakebots that side-wind can replicate this ascent.

==Current research==
Snakebots are currently being researched as a new type of robotic, interplanetary probe by engineers at the NASA Ames Research Center. Software for snakebots is also being developed by NASA, so that they can learn by experiencing the skills to scale obstacles and remembering the techniques.

Snake robots are also being developed for search and rescue purposes at Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Biorobotics Lab.

<text>69 Hesperia is a large, M-type main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli on April 29, 1861 from Milan, while he was searching for the recently discovered 63 Ausonia. It was his only asteroid discovery. Schiaparelli named it Hesperia in honour of Italy (the word is a Greek term for the peninsula). The asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of , a semimajor axis of , and eccentricity of 0.165. The orbital plane is inclined by an angle of 8.59° to the plane of the ecliptic.

Hesperia was observed by Arecibo radar in February 2010. Radar observations combined with lightcurve-based shape models, lead to a diameter estimate of . The radar albedo is consistent with a high-metal M-type asteroid. In the near infrared, a weak absorption feature near a wavelength of 0.9 μm can be attributed to orthopyroxenes on the surface. A meteorite analogue of the reflectance spectra from 69 Hesperia is the Hoba ataxite.

<text>Thomas Giles Robinson (born 1 June 1950) is a British singer, bassist, radio presenter and long-time LGBT rights activist, best known for the hits &quot;Glad to Be Gay&quot;, &quot;2-4-6-8 Motorway&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Take No for an Answer&quot;, with his Tom Robinson Band. He later peaked at No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart with his solo single &quot;War Baby&quot;.

==Early life==
Tom Robinson was born into a middle-class family in Cambridge on 1 June 1950. He attended Friends&#x27; School, Saffron Walden, a co-ed privately funded Quaker school, between 1961 and 1967. He played guitar in a trio at school called The Inquisition. Robinson has two brothers, Matthew (a former BBC executive producer) and George, and a sister, Sophy.

At the age of 13, Robinson realised that he was gay when he fell in love with another boy at school. Until 1967, male homosexual activity was a crime in England, punishable by prison. He had a nervous breakdown and attempted suicide at 16. A head teacher got him transferred to Finchden Manor, a therapeutic community, in Kent, for teenagers with emotional difficulties, where he spent his following six years. At the community, Robinson was inspired by John Peel&#x27;s &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; on pirate Radio London, and by a visit from Alexis Korner. The blues musician and broadcaster transfixed a roomful of people, using nothing but his voice and an acoustic guitar. The whole direction of Robinson&#x27;s life and career became suddenly clear to him.

==Career==

In 1973, Robinson moved to London and joined the acoustic trio Café Society. They impressed Ray Davies, of The Kinks, enough for him to sign them to his Konk label and produce their debut album. According to Robinson, Davies&#x27;s other commitments made the recording a lengthy process and, after it sold only 600 copies, he left the band.

Subsequently, when the Tom Robinson Band were playing at the Nashville Rooms in London, Robinson saw Davies enter and sarcastically performed The Kinks&#x27; hit &quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot;. Davies retaliated with a mocking Kinks song &quot;Prince of the Punks&quot; (released as a B Side of &quot;Father Christmas&quot;,) about Robinson. Robinson, in turn, wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Take No For An Answer&quot; about Davies&#x27; hindering his career, later released on the &quot;Rising Free&quot; EP.

In London, Robinson became involved in the emerging gay scene and embraced the politics of gay liberation, which linked gay rights to wider issues of social justice. Inspired by an early Sex Pistols gig, he founded the more political Tom Robinson Band in 1976. The following year the group released the single &quot;2-4-6-8 Motorway&quot;, which peaked at No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks. The song alludes obliquely to a gay truck driver. In February 1978, the band released the live extended play &quot;Rising Free&quot;, which peaked at No. 18 in the UK Singles Chart and included his anthemic song &quot;Glad to Be Gay&quot;, originally written for a 1976 London gay pride parade. The song was banned by the BBC. It did receive extensive daytime play on Capital Radio. In May 1978, the band released its debut album, &quot;Power in the Darkness&quot;, which was very well received, peaking at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart, and receiving a gold certification by the BPI. Their second album, &quot;TRB Two&quot; (1979), however, was a commercial and critical failure, and the band broke up four months after its release.

In 1979, Robinson co-wrote several songs with Elton John, including his minor hit &quot;Sartorial Eloquence (Don&#x27;t Ya Wanna Play This Game No More?)&quot;, which peaked at No. 39 in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and a song about a young boy in boarding school who has a crush on an older student called &quot;Elton&#x27;s Song&quot;. It was recorded, but not released until 1981 on the album &quot;The Fox&quot;. He played two songs live— &quot;Glad to Be Gay&quot; and &quot;1967 (So Long Ago)&quot; — during June of that year at The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball (1979).

In 1980, Robinson organised Sector 27, a less political rock band that released a critically acclaimed but unsuccessful album, &quot;Sector 27&quot;, produced by Steve Lillywhite. The band nevertheless received an enthusiastic reception at a Madison Square Garden concert with The Police. However, their management company went bankrupt, the band disintegrated, and Robinson suffered another nervous breakdown. Desolate, in debt, and sorrowing from a breakup with a beau, Robinson fled to Hamburg, Germany, much like his idol David Bowie had escaped to Berlin at a low point in his life. Living in a friend&#x27;s spare room, he began writing again and ended up working in East Berlin with local band NO55. He also released a German-language single, &quot;Tango an der Wand&quot; (&quot;Tango at the Wall&quot;), with lyrics by Horst Königstein, a director and screenwriter who had also written the lyrics to Peter Gabriel&#x27;s German albums. However, the single failed to have a commercial impact.

In 1982, Robinson penned the song &quot;War Baby&quot; about divisions between East and West Germany, and recorded his first solo album &quot;North by Northwest&quot; with producer Richard Mazda. &quot;War Baby&quot; peaked at No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart and at No. 1 in the UK Indie Chart for three weeks, reviving his career. His following single, &quot;Listen to the Radio: Atmospherics&quot;, co-written with Peter Gabriel, peaked at No. 39 in the UK Singles Chart, and provided him further income when it was covered by Pukka Orchestra in 1984. The Pukkas&#x27; version was a top 20 hit in Canada under the title &quot;Listen to the Radio&quot;.

Robinson&#x27;s return to Britain led to late-night performances in cabarets at the Edinburgh Fringe, some of which later surfaced on the live album &quot;Midnight at the Fringe&quot; (1988). His career enjoyed a resurgence in the mid-1990s with a trio of albums for the respected folk/roots label Cooking Vinyl and a Glastonbury performance in 1994.

In 1986, a BBC producer offered him his own radio show on the BBC World Service. Since then Robinson has, unusually, presented programmes on all the BBC&#x27;s national stations: Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3, Radio 4, 5 Live and 6 Music. He presented &quot;The Locker Room&quot;, a long-running series about men and masculinity, for Radio 4 in the early 1990s. In 1994 he wrote and presented &quot;Surviving Suicide&quot;, about his suicide attempt. In 1997, he won a Sony Academy Award for &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;, a radio documentary about gay music, produced by Benjamin Mepsted, and later hosted the &quot;Home Truths&quot; tribute to John Peel a year after his death in 2004. As of April 2024, Robinson presents &quot;Now Playing @6Music&quot;, a show that plays songs based on a certain theme and listeners&#x27; input.

Currently, Robinson rarely performs live, apart from two annual free concerts, known as the Castaway Parties, for members of his mailing list. These take place in South London and Belgium every January. In the Belgian Castaway shows, he introduces many songs in Dutch. The Castaway Parties invariably feature a wide variety of established and unknown artists and groups who have included Show of Hands, Philip Jeays, Jan Allain, Jakko Jakszyk, Stoney, Roddy Frame, Martyn Joseph, The Bewley Brothers and Paleday alongside personal friends such as Lee Griffiths and T. V. Smith.

In 2009, Robinson founded &quot;Fresh on the Net&quot;, a showcase website for upcoming bands and artists whose aim is &quot;to help independent musicians find new listeners, and independent listeners find new music&quot;.

Robinson played &quot;2-4-6-8 Motorway&quot; and &quot;Glad to Be Gay&quot; at the BBC introducing stage on the Friday afternoon of the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, after announcing that The Coral would not be showing as they were &#x27;stuck in the mud&#x27;. In July 2013, at the Tabernacle on Powis Square in Notting Hill, a new line-up of TRB performed the entire &quot;Power in the Darkness&quot; album to launch its release on CD. The title track featured a guest appearance by T. V. Smith.

In 2014, he was one of the performers at the opening ceremonies of WorldPride in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, alongside Melissa Etheridge, Deborah Cox and Steve Grand.

In October 2015 he released his first new album in 20 years, &quot;Only The Now&quot;. It included contributions from Billy Bragg, Ian McKellen and Lee Forsyth Griffiths. It was made with award-winning producer and multi-instrumentalist Gerry Diver and released on his own Castaway Northwest Recordings. Tom supported the album by playing many festivals that summer including Glastonbury, Latitude, Wickham and Green Man. He also played a showcase at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall in September and a 15-date tour throughout October and November. Robinson also received a BASCA Gold Badge award in the same month. This was for his exceptional contribution to British music.

In late 2018 and early 2019 Robinson deputised for Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker on his Sunday show &quot;Sounds of the 70s&quot;.

In 2020, Robinson embarked on a four-night solo acoustic tour prior to beginning a 22-date UK &quot;70th Birthday Tour&quot; featuring a 5-piece band.

==Personal life==
Robinson does not identify exclusively as gay. He has had past experiences with women and has said that he has always made it clear that he liked both men and women. He now identifies as bisexual, but in the past he used the phrase &#x27;gay&#x27;, synonymous with &#x27;queer&#x27;, to encompass the entire LGBT community. In an interview, he stated that he used the term &quot;gay&quot; because, &quot;as far as Joe Public is concerned, if you’re interested in other guys you’re a queer… to call ourselves bi-sexual is a cop-out.&quot;

A longtime supporter and former volunteer of London&#x27;s Gay Switchboard help-line, it was at a 1982 benefit party for the organisation that Robinson met Sue Brearley, the woman with whom he would eventually live and have two children, and later marry.

In the mid-1990s, when Robinson became a father, the tabloids ran stories about what they deemed as a sexual orientation change, running headlines such as &quot;Britain&#x27;s Number One Gay in Love with Girl Biker!&quot; (&quot;The Sunday People)&quot;. Robinson continued to identify as a gay man, telling an interviewer for &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I have much more sympathy with bisexuals now, but I am absolutely not one.&quot; He added, &quot;Our enemies do not draw the distinction between gay and bisexual.&quot;

In a 1994 interview for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; newspaper, Robinson said: &quot;We&#x27;ve been fighting for tolerance for the last 20 years, and I&#x27;ve campaigned for people to be able to love whoever the hell they want. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about: tolerance and freedom and liberty—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So if somebody won&#x27;t grant me the same tolerance I&#x27;ve been fighting for for them, hey, they&#x27;ve got a problem, not me.&quot;

In 1996 Robinson released an album &quot;Having It Both Ways&quot;. On it, he added a verse to &quot;Glad to Be Gay&quot;, in which he sings: &quot;Well if gay liberation means freedom for all, a label is no liberation at all. I&#x27;m here and I&#x27;m queer and do what I do, I&#x27;m not going to wear a straitjacket for you.&quot; In 1998, his epic album about bisexuality, &quot;Blood Brother&quot;, won three awards at the Gay &amp; Lesbian American Music Awards in New York. In the same year, he also performed at the fifth International Conference on Bisexuality at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Peter Tatchell criticised &quot;Glad Not to Be Gay&quot;, an article written by Vanessa Thorpe about Robinson in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, for suggesting the LGBT community would be &quot;shocked and angered&quot; that a gay man would &quot;go straight&quot;. Tatchell stated: &quot;Tom Robinson has behaved rather commendably, in my view. Ever since the beginning of his relationship with Sue, he has continued to describe himself as &#x27;a gay man who happens to be in love with a woman&#x27;. Who could quarrel with that? I can&#x27;t.&quot;

==Activism==
Robinson is a supporter of Amnesty International and Peter Tatchell&#x27;s OutRage! human rights organisation and was a leader of the Rock Against Racism campaign.

==In popular culture==
A fictionalised version of Tom Robinson, portrayed by Mathew Baynton, appears in the last episode of the first series of the BBC One television drama &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, as leader at a Gay Liberation Front protest in London. The character is later incarcerated with other protestors by the time-travelling protagonist, Detective Inspector Alex Drake (played by Keeley Hawes) and dismisses her claims that he will one day marry a woman. The scene supposedly takes place on 9 October 1981, precisely fourteen months before the real Tom Robinson met his future bride.

The character then leads other protestors in singing a round of &quot;Glad to Be Gay&quot; in the confinement facility, much to Sergeant Viv James&#x27; annoyance. &quot;2-4-6-8 Motorway&quot; is also used in the soundtrack during the protest after Detective Sergeant Ray Carling sings a few bars to Alex, who then proceeds to drive a pink tank over a parked Ford Escort, which she believes would otherwise have later been used in a car bombing. Robinson&#x27;s song &quot;War Baby&quot; (which he premiered the night he met his wife) is used in the soundtrack of the third series.

==Discography==
Over his career, Robinson has released more than twenty albums either as a solo performer or as a member of a group. He has also released fanclub-only bootlegs known as the &quot;Castaway Club&quot; series.

<doc id="735608" wikidata="Q68476" url="?curid=735608" title="Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg">
<text>Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg (16 March 1445 – 10 March 1510) was a priest, considered one of the greatest of the popular preachers of the 15th century. He was closely connected with the Renaissance humanists of Strasbourg, whose leader was the well-known Jakob Wimpfeling (1450–1528), called &quot;the educator of Germany&quot;. Like Wimpfeling, Geiler was a secular priest; both fought the ecclesiastical abuses of the age, but not in the spirit of Martin Luther and his adherents. They looked, instead, for salvation and preservation only in the restoration of Christian morals in Church and State through the faithful maintenance of the doctrines of the Church. However the moral reforms of Johann Geiler laid the groundwork for the Protestant reformation in Strasbourg.

== Early life and education ==
He was born at Schaffhausen, but from 1448 passed his childhood and youth at Kaysersberg in Upper Alsace. His grandfather, who brought him up, lived there. The father was killed by a hunting-accident when Geiler was three years old; and his grandfather took charge of the education of the child, sending him to the school at Ammerschwihr, near Kaysersberg, where his mother lived.

In 1460, when he was fifteen years old, Johann entered the University of Freiburg; which had just opened. Two years later he received the baccalaureate, and after two more years was made Master of Arts. He now gave lectures on various writings of Aristotle in the next semester. After graduation, he lectured there for some time on the &quot;Sententiae&quot; of Peter Lombard, the commentaries of Alexander of Hales, and several of the works of Aristotle. He filled the office of dean of the philosophical faculty for a brief period.

A living interest in theological subjects, awakened by the study of Jean Gerson, led him to the University of Basel in May 1471, recently founded at that time. He obtained the doctorate in 1475. At Basel he became acquainted with Sebastian Brant, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. While at Basle, Geiler preached his first sermons in the cathedral. The magistracy and citizens of that city obtained his appointment to the Freiburg University, of which he was elected rector the next year.

== Professional career ==
For a time he preached in the cathedral of Würzburg. Peter Schott, senator of Strasbourg, an important and influential citizen who had charge of the property of the cathedral, strongly urged Geiler to settle in Strasbourg. At that time preachers were supplied to Strasbourg by the mendicant orders but this led to a frequent change of preachers and friction between them and the cathedral clergy. This led the cathedral chapter, the bishop (then Albert of Palatinate-Mosbach) and the city authorities to prefer having a secular priest as a permanent preacher. Such as post was set up in 1478 and Geiler accepted the invitation to fill it, continuing to preach and work in Strasbourg with few interruptions up until shortly before his death.

The beautiful pulpit erected for him in 1481 in the nave of the cathedral, when the chapel of Saint Lawrence had proved too small, still bears witness to the popularity he enjoyed as a preacher in the immediate sphere of his labors, and the testimonies of Sebastian Brant, Beatus Rhenanus, Johann Reuchlin, Philipp Melanchthon and others show how great had been the influence of his personal character. He not only preached, as required, every Sunday and feast day in the cathedral, and even daily during fasts, but also, on special occasions, in the monasteries of the city and often outside of the city. His sermons, bold, incisive, denunciatory, abounding in quaint illustrations and based on texts by no means confined to the Bible, taken down as he spoke them, and circulated (sometimes without his knowledge or consent), by his friends, told perceptibly on the German thought as well as on the German speech of his time. It is an indicator of Strasbourg&#x27;s thriving printing industry that most of Geiler&#x27;s sermons were printed and widely distributed.
He frequently visited Friedrich von Hohenzollern, Bishop of Augsburg, who was very friendly to him; once he was called to Füssen on the river Lech by his patron the Emperor Maximilian, who desired his advice. He made pious pilgrimages. At Einsiedeln in Switzerland he met the Blessed Nikolaus of Flüe, who was even then well known; another time he journeyed to Sainte-Baume, near Marseilles, in order to pray in the grotto of St. Mary Magdalen. A kidney trouble developed, to relieve which he was obliged to annually visit the hot springs of Baden; dropsy finally appeared, and he died on Lætare Sunday 1510 in Strasbourg. The next day, in the presence of an immense multitude of people, he was buried at the foot of the pulpit which had been especially built for him.

==Work and style==

Among the many volumes published under his name only two appear to have had the benefit of his revision, namely, &quot;Der Seelen Paradies von waren und volkumen Tugenden&quot;, and that entitled &quot;Das irrig Schaf&quot;. Of the rest, probably the best-known is a series of lectures on his friend Sebastian Brant&#x27;s work, &quot;Das Narrenschiff&quot; or the &quot;Navicula&quot; or &quot;Speculum fatuorum&quot;, of which an edition was published at Strasbourg in 1511 under the following title: &quot;Navicula sive speculum fatuorum praestantissimi sacrarumliterarum doctoris Joannis Geiler Keysersbergii&quot;.

The numerous volumes of Geiler&#x27;s sermons and writings which have been published do not give a complete picture of the characteristic qualities of the preacher. An orator, Geiler sought, without regard to other considerations, was to produce the most powerful effect on his hearers. He prepared himself with great care for the pulpit, writing out his sermons beforehand, as his contemporary Beatus Rhenanus reports; those preparatory compositions were drawn up not in German, but in Latin.
Only a very small part of the sermons that have been issued under his name are directly his. At a very early date his addresses were taken down by others and published. The best critic of Geiler&#x27;s works, E. Martin of Strasbourg, attempted, in the &quot;Allgemeine deutsche Biographie&quot;, to give a summary of Geiler&#x27;s genuine writings; according to him the authenticated writings number thirty-five.

It is not certain that any of the extant works give exactly what Geiler said. It is evident from them that the Strasbourg preacher was widely read, not only in theology, but also in the secular literature of the day. This is shown by the sermons having Sebastian Brant&#x27;s &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, which appeared in 1494, for their theme; these sermons attained the greatest popularity. Geiler displayed also facility in using public events to attract and hold the attention of his hearers.

In originality of speech Geiler is in form, as in time, between Berthold of Ratisbon and Abraham a Sancta Clara. Geiler himself complained bitterly that neither clergy nor laity were willing to join in a common reform. His works are an important source for the history of the civilization of those times. His thoughts were expressed in the language of ordinary life: Geiler&#x27;s writings are a source for the knowledge of the speech, customs and beliefs of the common people at the beginning of the sixteenth century.

== Posthumous ==

A school in Strasbourg (&quot;Lycée Jean Geiler&quot;), as well as a street in the Neustadt district of the same town, are named after him.

<text>In electrical engineering and electronics, a &quot;network&quot; is a collection of interconnected components. Network analysis is the process of finding the voltages across, and the currents through, all network components. There are many techniques for calculating these values; however, for the most part, the techniques assume linear components. Except where stated, the methods described in this article are applicable only to &quot;linear&quot; network analysis.

==Definitions==
==Equivalent circuits==
A useful procedure in network analysis is to simplify the network by reducing the number of components. This can be done by replacing physical components with other notional components that have the same effect. A particular technique might directly reduce the number of components, for instance by combining impedances in series. On the other hand, it might merely change the form into one in which the components can be reduced in a later operation. For instance, one might transform a voltage generator into a current generator using Norton&#x27;s theorem in order to be able to later combine the internal resistance of the generator with a parallel impedance load. 

A resistive circuit is a circuit containing only resistors, ideal current sources, and ideal voltage sources. If the sources are constant (DC) sources, the result is a DC circuit. Analysis of a circuit consists of solving for the voltages and currents present in the circuit. The solution principles outlined here also apply to phasor analysis of AC circuits.

Two circuits are said to be equivalent with respect to a pair of terminals if the voltage across the terminals and current through the terminals for one network have the same relationship as the voltage and current at the terminals of the other network.

If formula_1 implies formula_2 for all (real) values of , then with respect to terminals and , circuit 1 and circuit 2 are equivalent.

The above is a sufficient definition for a one-port network. For more than one port, then it must be defined that the currents and voltages between all pairs of corresponding ports must bear the same relationship. For instance, star and delta networks are effectively three port networks and hence require three simultaneous equations to fully specify their equivalence.

===Impedances in series and in parallel===

Some two terminal network of impedances can eventually be reduced to a single impedance by successive applications of impedances in series or impedances in parallel.

*Impedances in series: formula_3
*Impedances in parallel: formula_4
**The above simplified for only two impedances in parallel: formula_5

===Delta-wye transformation===


A network of impedances with more than two terminals cannot be reduced to a single impedance equivalent circuit. An -terminal network can, at best, be reduced to impedances (at worst formula_6). For a three terminal network, the three impedances can be expressed as a three node delta (Δ) network or four node star (Y) network. These two networks are equivalent and the transformations between them are given below. A general network with an arbitrary number of nodes cannot be reduced to the minimum number of impedances using only series and parallel combinations. In general, Y-Δ and Δ-Y transformations must also be used. For some networks the extension of Y-Δ to star-polygon transformations may also be required.

For equivalence, the impedances between any pair of terminals must be the same for both networks, resulting in a set of three simultaneous equations. The equations below are expressed as resistances but apply equally to the general case with impedances.

====Delta-to-star transformation equations====
:formula_7

====Star-to-delta transformation equations====

:formula_8

===General form of network node elimination===
The star-to-delta and series-resistor transformations are special cases of the general resistor network node elimination algorithm. Any node connected by resistors to nodes can be replaced by formula_9 resistors interconnecting the remaining nodes. The resistance between any two nodes is given by:
:formula_10
For a star-to-delta () this reduces to:
:formula_11
For a series reduction () this reduces to:
:formula_12
For a dangling resistor () it results in the elimination of the resistor because formula_13.

===Source transformation===
A generator with an internal impedance (i.e. non-ideal generator) can be represented as either an ideal voltage generator or an ideal current generator plus the impedance. These two forms are equivalent and the transformations are given below. If the two networks are equivalent with respect to terminals ab, then and must be identical for both networks. Thus,

:formula_14 or formula_15
* Norton&#x27;s theorem states that any two-terminal linear network can be reduced to an ideal current generator and a parallel impedance.
* Thévenin&#x27;s theorem states that any two-terminal linear network can be reduced to an ideal voltage generator plus a series impedance.

==Simple networks==
Some very simple networks can be analysed without the need to apply the more systematic approaches.

===Voltage division of series components===

Consider n impedances that are connected in series. The voltage formula_16 across any impedance formula_17 is

:formula_18

===Current division of parallel components===

Consider n admittances that are connected in parallel. The current formula_19 through any admittance formula_20 is

:formula_21

for formula_22

====Special case: Current division of two parallel components====
:formula_23
:formula_24

==Nodal analysis==
Nodal analysis uses the concept of a node voltage and considers the node voltages to be the unknown variables. For all nodes, except a chosen reference node, the node voltage is defined as the voltage drop from the node to the reference node. Therefore, there are N-1 node voltages for a circuit with N nodes.

In principle, nodal analysis uses Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law (KCL) at N-1 nodes to get N-1 independent equations. Since equations generated with KCL are in terms of currents going in and out of nodes, these currents, if their values are not known, need to be represented by the unknown variables (node voltages). For some elements (such as resistors and capacitors) getting the element currents in terms of node voltages is trivial.

For some common elements where this is not possible, specialized methods are developed. For example, a concept called supernode is used for circuits with independent voltage sources.

# Label all nodes in the circuit. Arbitrarily select any node as reference.
# Define a voltage variable from every remaining node to the reference. These voltage variables must be defined as voltage rises with respect to the reference node.
# Write a KCL equation for every node except the reference.
# Solve the resulting system of equations.

==Mesh analysis==

Mesh — a loop that does not contain an inner loop.

# Count the number of “window panes” in the circuit. Assign a mesh current to each window pane.
# Write a KVL equation for every mesh whose current is unknown.
# Solve the resulting equations

==Superposition==
In this method, the effect of each generator in turn is calculated. All the generators other than the one being considered are removed and either short-circuited in the case of voltage generators or open-circuited in the case of current generators. The total current through or the total voltage across a particular branch is then calculated by summing all the individual currents or voltages.

There is an underlying assumption to this method that the total current or voltage is a linear superposition of its parts. Therefore, the method cannot be used if non-linear components are present. Superposition of powers cannot be used to find total power consumed by elements even in linear circuits. Power varies according to the square of total voltage or current and the square of the sum is not generally equal to the sum of the squares. Total power in an element can be found by applying superposition to the voltages and current independently and then calculating power from the total voltage and current.

==Choice of method==
Choice of method is to some extent a matter of taste. If the network is particularly simple or only a specific current or voltage is required then ad-hoc application of some simple equivalent circuits may yield the answer without recourse to the more systematic methods.
* Nodal analysis: The number of voltage variables, and hence simultaneous equations to solve, equals the number of nodes minus one. Every voltage source connected to the reference node reduces the number of unknowns and equations by one.
* Mesh analysis: The number of current variables, and hence simultaneous equations to solve, equals the number of meshes. Every current source in a mesh reduces the number of unknowns by one. Mesh analysis can only be used with networks which can be drawn as a planar network, that is, with no crossing components.
* Superposition is possibly the most conceptually simple method but rapidly leads to a large number of equations and messy impedance combinations as the network becomes larger.
* Effective medium approximations: For a network consisting of a high density of random resistors, an exact solution for each individual element may be impractical or impossible. Instead, the effective resistance and current distribution properties can be modelled in terms of graph measures and geometrical properties of networks.

==Transfer function==
A transfer function expresses the relationship between an input and an output of a network. For resistive networks, this will always be a simple real number or an expression which boils down to a real number. Resistive networks are represented by a system of simultaneous algebraic equations. However, in the general case of linear networks, the network is represented by a system of simultaneous linear differential equations. In network analysis, rather than use the differential equations directly, it is usual practice to carry out a Laplace transform on them first and then express the result in terms of the Laplace parameter s, which in general is complex. This is described as working in the s-domain. Working with the equations directly would be described as working in the time (or t) domain because the results would be expressed as time varying quantities. The Laplace transform is the mathematical method of transforming between the s-domain and the t-domain.

This approach is standard in control theory and is useful for determining stability of a system, for instance, in an amplifier with feedback.

===Two terminal component transfer functions===
For two terminal components the transfer function, or more generally for non-linear elements, the constitutive equation, is the relationship between the current input to the device and the resulting voltage across it. The transfer function, Z(s), will thus have units of impedance, ohms. For the three passive components found in electrical networks, the transfer functions are;
For a network to which only steady ac signals are applied, s is replaced with &quot;jω&quot; and the more familiar values from ac network theory result.

Finally, for a network to which only steady dc is applied, s is replaced with zero and dc network theory applies.

===Two port network transfer function===
Transfer functions, in general, in control theory are given the symbol H(s). Most commonly in electronics, transfer function is defined as the ratio of output voltage to input voltage and given the symbol A(s), or more commonly (because analysis is invariably done in terms of sine wave response), &quot;A&quot;(&quot;jω&quot;), so that;
formula_25

The &quot;A&quot; standing for attenuation, or amplification, depending on context. In general, this will be a complex function of &quot;jω&quot;, which can be derived from an analysis of the impedances in the network and their individual transfer functions. Sometimes the analyst is only interested in the magnitude of the gain and not the phase angle. In this case the complex numbers can be eliminated from the transfer function and it might then be written as;
formula_26

====Two port parameters====

The concept of a two-port network can be useful in network analysis as a black box approach to analysis. The behaviour of the two-port network in a larger network can be entirely characterised without necessarily stating anything about the internal structure. However, to do this it is necessary to have more information than just the A(jω) described above. It can be shown that four such parameters are required to fully characterise the two-port network. These could be the forward transfer function, the input impedance, the reverse transfer function (i.e., the voltage appearing at the input when a voltage is applied to the output) and the output impedance. There are many others (see the main article for a full listing), one of these expresses all four parameters as impedances. It is usual to express the four parameters as a matrix;
formula_27

The matrix may be abbreviated to a representative element;

formula_28 or just formula_29

These concepts are capable of being extended to networks of more than two ports. However, this is rarely done in reality because, in many practical cases, ports are considered either purely input or purely output. If reverse direction transfer functions are ignored, a multi-port network can always be decomposed into a number of two-port networks.

====Distributed components====
Where a network is composed of discrete components, analysis using two-port networks is a matter of choice, not essential. The network can always alternatively be analysed in terms of its individual component transfer functions. However, if a network contains distributed components, such as in the case of a transmission line, then it is not possible to analyse in terms of individual components since they do not exist. The most common approach to this is to model the line as a two-port network and characterise it using two-port parameters (or something equivalent to them). Another example of this technique is modelling the carriers crossing the base region in a high frequency transistor. The base region has to be modelled as distributed resistance and capacitance rather than lumped components.

====Image analysis====

Transmission lines and certain types of filter design use the image method to determine their transfer parameters. In this method, the behaviour of an infinitely long cascade connected chain of identical networks is considered. The input and output impedances and the forward and reverse transmission functions are then calculated for this infinitely long chain. Although the theoretical values so obtained can never be exactly realised in practice, in many cases they serve as a very good approximation for the behaviour of a finite chain as long as it is not too short.

== Time-based network analysis with simulation ==

Most analysis methods calculate the voltage and current values for static networks, which are circuits consisting of memoryless components only but have difficulties with complex dynamic networks. In general, the equations that describe the behaviour of a dynamic circuit are in the form of a differential-algebraic system of equations (DAEs). DAEs are challenging to solve and the methods for doing so are not yet fully understood and developed (as of 2010). Also, there is no general theorem that guarantees solutions to DAEs will exist and be unique. In special cases, the equations of the dynamic circuit will be in the form of an ordinary differential equations (ODE), which are easier to solve, since numerical methods for solving ODEs have a rich history, dating back to the late 1800s. One strategy for adapting ODE solution methods to DAEs is called direct discretization and is the method of choice in circuit simulation. 

Simulation-based methods for time-based network analysis solve a circuit that is posed as an initial value problem (IVP). That is, the values of the components with memories (for example, the voltages on capacitors and currents through inductors) are given at an initial point of time , and the analysis is done for the time formula_30. Since finding numerical results for the infinite number of time points from to is not possible, this time period is discretized into discrete time instances, and the numerical solution is found for every instance. The time between the time instances is called the time step and can be fixed throughout the whole simulation or may be adaptive.

In an IVP, when finding a solution for time , the solution for time is already known. Then, temporal discretization is used to replace the derivatives with differences, such as formula_31 for the backward Euler method, where is the time step. 

If all circuit components were linear or the circuit was linearized beforehand, the equation system at this point is a system of linear equations and is solved with numerical linear algebra methods. Otherwise, it is a nonlinear algebraic equation system and is solved with nonlinear numerical methods such as Root-finding algorithms.

=== Comparison to other methods ===
Simulation methods are much more applicable than Laplace transform based methods, such as transfer functions, which only work for simple dynamic networks with capacitors and inductors. Also, the input signals to the network cannot be arbitrarily defined for Laplace transform based methods.

==Non-linear networks==
Most electronic designs are, in reality, non-linear. There are very few that do not include some semiconductor devices. These are invariably non-linear, the transfer function of an ideal semiconductor p-n junction is given by the very non-linear relationship;

:formula_32

where;
* &quot;i&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are the instantaneous current and voltage.
* &quot;Io&quot; is an arbitrary parameter called the reverse leakage current whose value depends on the construction of the device.
* &quot;VT&quot; is a parameter proportional to temperature called the thermal voltage and equal to about 25mV at room temperature.

There are many other ways that non-linearity can appear in a network. All methods utilising linear superposition will fail when non-linear components are present. There are several options for dealing with non-linearity depending on the type of circuit and the information the analyst wishes to obtain.

===Constitutive equations===
The diode equation above is an example of an element constitutive equation of the general form,

:formula_33

This can be thought of as a non-linear resistor. The corresponding constitutive equations for non-linear inductors and capacitors are respectively;

:formula_34
:formula_35

where &quot;f&quot; is any arbitrary function, &quot;φ&quot; is the stored magnetic flux and &quot;q&quot; is the stored charge.

===Existence, uniqueness and stability===
An important consideration in non-linear analysis is the question of uniqueness. For a network composed of linear components there will always be one, and only one, unique solution for a given set of boundary conditions. This is not always the case in non-linear circuits. For instance, a linear resistor with a fixed current applied to it has only one solution for the voltage across it. On the other hand, the non-linear tunnel diode has up to three solutions for the voltage for a given current. That is, a particular solution for the current through the diode is not unique, there may be others, equally valid. In some cases there may not be a solution at all: the question of existence of solutions must be considered.

Another important consideration is the question of stability. A particular solution may exist, but it may not be stable, rapidly departing from that point at the slightest stimulation. It can be shown that a network that is absolutely stable for all conditions must have one, and only one, solution for each set of conditions.

===Methods===

====Boolean analysis of switching networks====
A switching device is one where the non-linearity is utilised to produce two opposite states. CMOS devices in digital circuits, for instance, have their output connected to either the positive or the negative supply rail and are never found at anything in between except during a transient period when the device is switching. Here the non-linearity is designed to be extreme, and the analyst can take advantage of that fact. These kinds of networks can be analysed using Boolean algebra by assigning the two states (&quot;on&quot;/&quot;off&quot;, &quot;positive&quot;/&quot;negative&quot; or whatever states are being used) to the Boolean constants &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;.

The transients are ignored in this analysis, along with any slight discrepancy between the state of the device and the nominal state assigned to a Boolean value. For instance, Boolean &quot;1&quot; may be assigned to the state of +5V. The output of the device may be +4.5V but the analyst still considers this to be Boolean &quot;1&quot;. Device manufacturers will usually specify a range of values in their data sheets that are to be considered undefined (i.e. the result will be unpredictable).

The transients are not entirely uninteresting to the analyst. The maximum rate of switching is determined by the speed of transition from one state to the other. Happily for the analyst, for many devices most of the transition occurs in the linear portion of the devices transfer function and linear analysis can be applied to obtain at least an approximate answer.

It is mathematically possible to derive Boolean algebras that have more than two states. There is not too much use found for these in electronics, although three-state devices are passingly common.

====Separation of bias and signal analyses====
This technique is used where the operation of the circuit is to be essentially linear, but the devices used to implement it are non-linear. A transistor amplifier is an example of this kind of network. The essence of this technique is to separate the analysis into two parts. Firstly, the dc biases are analysed using some non-linear method. This establishes the quiescent operating point of the circuit. Secondly, the small signal characteristics of the circuit are analysed using linear network analysis. Examples of methods that can be used for both these stages are given below.

====Graphical method of dc analysis====
In a great many circuit designs, the dc bias is fed to a non-linear component via a resistor (or possibly a network of resistors). Since resistors are linear components, it is particularly easy to determine the quiescent operating point of the non-linear device from a graph of its transfer function. The method is as follows: from linear network analysis the output transfer function (that is output voltage against output current) is calculated for the network of resistor(s) and the generator driving them. This will be a straight line (called the load line) and can readily be superimposed on the transfer function plot of the non-linear device. The point where the lines cross is the quiescent operating point.

Perhaps the easiest practical method is to calculate the (linear) network open circuit voltage and short circuit current and plot these on the transfer function of the non-linear device. The straight line joining these two point is the transfer function of the network.

In reality, the designer of the circuit would proceed in the reverse direction to that described. Starting from a plot provided in the manufacturers data sheet for the non-linear device, the designer would choose the desired operating point and then calculate the linear component values required to achieve it.

It is still possible to use this method if the device being biased has its bias fed through another device which is itself non-linear, a diode for instance. In this case however, the plot of the network transfer function onto the device being biased would no longer be a straight line and is consequently more tedious to do.

====Small signal equivalent circuit====

This method can be used where the deviation of the input and output signals in a network stay within a substantially linear portion of the non-linear devices transfer function, or else are so small that the curve of the transfer function can be considered linear. Under a set of these specific conditions, the non-linear device can be represented by an equivalent linear network. It must be remembered that this equivalent circuit is entirely notional and only valid for the small signal deviations. It is entirely inapplicable to the dc biasing of the device.

For a simple two-terminal device, the small signal equivalent circuit may be no more than two components. A resistance equal to the slope of the v/i curve at the operating point (called the dynamic resistance), and tangent to the curve. A generator, because this tangent will not, in general, pass through the origin. With more terminals, more complicated equivalent circuits are required.

A popular form of specifying the small signal equivalent circuit amongst transistor manufacturers is to use the two-port network parameters known as [h] parameters. These are a matrix of four parameters as with the [z] parameters but in the case of the [h] parameters they are a hybrid mixture of impedances, admittances, current gains and voltage gains. In this model the three terminal transistor is considered to be a two port network, one of its terminals being common to both ports. The [h] parameters are quite different depending on which terminal is chosen as the common one. The most important parameter for transistors is usually the forward current gain, h21, in the common emitter configuration. This is designated hfe on data sheets.

The small signal equivalent circuit in terms of two-port parameters leads to the concept of dependent generators. That is, the value of a voltage or current generator depends linearly on a voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit. For instance the [z] parameter model leads to dependent voltage generators as shown in this diagram;

There will always be dependent generators in a two-port parameter equivalent circuit. This applies to the [h] parameters as well as to the [z] and any other kind. These dependencies must be preserved when developing the equations in a larger linear network analysis.

====Piecewise linear method====
In this method, the transfer function of the non-linear device is broken up into regions. Each of these regions is approximated by a straight line. Thus, the transfer function will be linear up to a particular point where there will be a discontinuity. Past this point the transfer function will again be linear but with a different slope.

A well known application of this method is the approximation of the transfer function of a pn junction diode. The transfer function of an ideal diode has been given at the top of this (non-linear) section. However, this formula is rarely used in network analysis, a piecewise approximation being used instead. It can be seen that the diode current rapidly diminishes to -Io as the voltage falls. This current, for most purposes, is so small it can be ignored. With increasing voltage, the current increases exponentially. The diode is modelled as an open circuit up to the knee of the exponential curve, then past this point as a resistor equal to the bulk resistance of the semiconducting material.

The commonly accepted values for the transition point voltage are 0.7V for silicon devices and 0.3V for germanium devices. An even simpler model of the diode, sometimes used in switching applications, is short circuit for forward voltages and open circuit for reverse voltages.

The model of a forward biased pn junction having an approximately constant 0.7V is also a much used approximation for transistor base-emitter junction voltage in amplifier design.

The piecewise method is similar to the small signal method in that linear network analysis techniques can only be applied if the signal stays within certain bounds. If the signal crosses a discontinuity point then the model is no longer valid for linear analysis purposes. The model does have the advantage over small signal however, in that it is equally applicable to signal and dc bias. These can therefore both be analysed in the same operations and will be linearly superimposable.

===Time-varying components===
In linear analysis, the components of the network are assumed to be unchanging, but in some circuits this does not apply, such as sweep oscillators, voltage controlled amplifiers, and variable equalisers. In many circumstances the change in component value is periodic. A non-linear component excited with a periodic signal, for instance, can be represented as a periodically varying &quot;linear&quot; component. Sidney Darlington disclosed a method of analysing such periodic time varying circuits. He developed canonical circuit forms which are analogous to the canonical forms of Ronald M. Foster and Wilhelm Cauer used for analysing linear circuits.

===Vector circuit theory===
Generalization of circuit theory based on scalar quantities to vectorial currents is a necessity for newly evolving circuits such as spin circuits. Generalized circuit variables consist of four components: scalar current and vector spin current in x, y, and z directions. The voltages and currents each become vector quantities with conductance described as a 4x4 spin conductance matrix.

<text>James Lowry Robinson (September 17, 1838 – July 11, 1887) was a Democratic politician from the U.S. state of North Carolina; he served as the fourth lieutenant governor of the state for four years under Governor Thomas J. Jarvis and as acting Governor of North Carolina for one month in 1883. Earlier in his political career he served in the North Carolina House of Representatives, including as Speaker, and then the North Carolina Senate.

==Early life==
Robinson was born and raised in Franklin, North Carolina; he served in the North Carolina militia during the American Civil War and was wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines. Robinson left the military in 1863 and opened a general store in Macon County.

==Politics==
Robinson was first elected to public office in 1868, when he was chosen to represent Macon County in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He served there until 1875, the last three years as House Speaker. Robinson then moved up to the state senate, where he served three terms between 1876 and 1880, including one as Senate President Pro Tempore.

As president pro tempore, Robinson became (unofficially) acting lieutenant governor in 1879, after Thomas Jordan Jarvis&#x27;s succession to the governorship. He was elected Lt. Governor is his own right in the 1880 election on the Democratic ticket with Jarvis. Robinson served as acting Governor of North Carolina for four weeks in September 1883 when Governor Jarvis left the state for an extended period to attend an exhibition. The most notable events of his administration were two official pardons granted to prisoners, one to a dying Cherokee man, and one to a murderer who Robinson judged acted in self-defense. Robinson resigned as the lieutenant governor on October 31, 1884 in order to be a candidate for the state house. He was elected to the state house from Macon County and served in the legislature of 1885.

==Later life and death==
After his term in the state house, Robinson suffered from financial difficulties. The &quot;Raleigh News and Observer&quot; reported on November 6, 1887 that Robinson was deathly ill and was being treated by a doctor from Asheville. Robinson died later in the year, according to a list of North Carolinians who died in 1887 listed in the &quot;Fayetteville Observer&quot; on January 19, 1888.

The town of Robbinsville, North Carolina is thought to be named in his honor.

<text>Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer (1987) is a memoir written by Peter Wright, former MI5 officer and Assistant Director, and co-author Paul Greengrass. Wright drew on his experiences and research into the history of the British intelligence community. Published first in Australia, the book was banned in England (but not Scotland) due to its allegations about government policy and incidents. These efforts ensured the book&#x27;s notoriety, and it earned considerable profit for Wright.

In 2021 and 2023, the Cabinet Office was still blocking or redacting freedom of information requests for files on the &quot;Spycatcher&quot; affair despite the rule that documents should be released after 30 years. Information belonging to the security services is absolutely exempted from the Freedom of Information Act.

== Content ==

In &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, Wright says that one of his assignments was to unmask a Soviet mole in MI5, who he says was Roger Hollis, a former MI5 Director General. His book also discusses other candidates who may have or may not have been the mole. He explores the history of MI5 by chronicling its principal officers, from the 1930s to his time in service. He makes serious allegations against MI6 intelligence officer Dick Ellis, who died in 1975.

Wright also tells of the MI6 plot to assassinate President Nasser during the Suez Crisis; of joint MI5-CIA plotting against Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson (who had been secretly accused by Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn of being a KGB agent); and of MI5&#x27;s eavesdropping on high-level Commonwealth conferences.

Wright examines the techniques of intelligence services, exposes their ethics, notably their &quot;eleventh commandment&quot;, &quot;Thou shalt not get caught.&quot; He described many MI5 electronic technologies (some of which he developed), for instance, allowing clever spying into rooms, and identifying the frequency to which a superhet receiver is tuned. In the afterword, he said that he wrote the book chiefly to work to regain compensation for losses of significant pension income when the British government ruled his pension for earlier work in GCHQ was not transferable.

==Publication and trial==
Wright wrote &quot;Spycatcher&quot; in Tasmania, after his retirement from MI5. He first attempted publication of his memoirs in 1985. The British government immediately obtained a court order banning publication in the UK, but the order applied only in the United Kingdom (and even then did not apply in Scotland with its separate legal system), and the book continued to be available elsewhere. In September 1987, the UK government applied for similar orders to prevent publication in Australia, but future Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, representing the publisher, successfully resisted the application, as he did on appeal in June 1988.

English newspapers attempting proper reporting about &quot;Spycatcher&quot;″s principal allegations were served gag orders; on persisting, they were tried for contempt of court. These charges were eventually dropped. Throughout all this, the book continued to be sold in Scotland; moreover, Scottish newspapers were not subject to any English gag order, and continued to report on the affair. Quantities of the book easily reached English purchasers from Scotland, while other copies were smuggled into England from Australia and elsewhere. A notable television report at the time featured a reporter flying to Australia, and returning to England with ten copies of the book, which he declared to Heathrow airport&#x27;s customs officers. After some discussion, he was allowed to take the books into England, as the customs service had not been told to confiscate them.

In mid-1987, Mr Justice Scott lifted the ban on English newspaper reportage on the book. In late July, the Law Lords again barred reporting Wright&#x27;s allegations. &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; published upside-down photographs of the three Law Lords, with the caption &#x27;You Fools&#x27;. British editions of &quot;The Economist&quot; ran a blank page with a boxed explanation that

Eventually, in 1988, the book was cleared for legitimate sale when the Law Lords acknowledged that overseas publication meant it contained no secrets. However, Wright was barred from receiving royalties from the sale of the book in the United Kingdom. In November 1991, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the British government had breached the European Convention of Human Rights in gagging its newspapers.
The accuracy of various allegations made in the book by Wright was questioned in a 1993 review of &quot;Spycatcher&quot; published by the Center for the Study of Intelligence, an in-house think tank for the CIA. While admitting (on page 42) that the book included &quot;factual data&quot;, the document stated that it was also &quot;filled with [unspecified] errors, exaggerations, bogus ideas, and self-inflation&quot;.

The book has sold more than two million copies. In 1995, Wright died a millionaire from proceeds of his book.

<text>Professional mobile radio (also known as private mobile radio (PMR) in the UK) are person-to-person two-way radio voice communications systems which use portable, mobile, base station, and dispatch console radios. PMR systems are based on such standards as MPT-1327, TETRA, APCO 25, and DMR which are designed for dedicated use by specific organizations, or standards such as NXDN intended for general commercial use. These systems are used by police, fire, ambulance, and emergency services, and by commercial firms such as taxis and delivery services. Most systems are half-duplex, in which multiple radios share a common radio channel, and only one can transmit at a time. Transceivers are normally in receive mode, the user presses a push-to-talk button on his microphone when he wants to talk, which turns on his transmitter and turns off his receiver. They use channels in the VHF and UHF bands, giving them a limited range, usually depending on terrain. Output power is typically limited to 4 watts. Repeaters installed on tall buildings, hills or mountain peaks are used to increase the range of systems.

==Introduction==
When private- or professional-mobile-radio (PMR) first started the systems simply consisted of a single base station with a number of mobiles that could communicate with this single base station. These systems are still in widespread use today with taxi firms and many others using them for communication. Now facilities such as DTMF and CTCSS provide additional calling selection. Because the antenna may be mounted on a high tower, coverage may extend up to distances of fifty kilometres. This is helpful especially when there is no signal in a GSM mobile phone.

Licenses are allocated for operation on a particular channel or channels. The user can then have use of these channels to contact the mobile stations in their fleet. The base station may be run by the user themselves or it may be run by an operating company who will hire out channels to individual users. In this way a single base station with a number of different channels can be run by one operator for a number of different users and this makes efficient use of the base station equipment. The base station site can also be located at a position that will give optimum radio coverage, and private lines can be provided to connect the users control office to the transmitter site. As there is no incremental cost for the transmissions that are made, individual calls are not charged, but instead there is a rental for overall use of the system. For those users with their own licences they naturally have to pay for the licence and the cost of purchase and maintenance of that equipment.

The term PMR is often used by the public and magazine publishing to refer to the low power (500 milliwatt) PMR446 license exempt radio systems that consist of sixteen FM frequencies between 446.00625 and 446.19375 MHz for analog FM and thirty-two FDMA (digital) channels between 446.003125 and 446.196875 MHz. These are used for personal or business communications where they are legal. Split frequency repeaters are not allowed on these frequencies and these radios do not communicate with licensed PMR systems. PMR446 radios are much cheaper than those used for the licensed PMR systems. 

==Modulation==
In general narrow band frequency modulation is the chosen form of modulation, although airport services use amplitude modulation. Typically a deviation of 2.5 kHz is used for FM and this enables a channel spacing of 12.5 kHz to be implemented. As the demands for PMR are high, it is necessary to make effective use of the channels available. This is achieved by re-using the frequencies in different areas. Base stations must be located sufficiently far apart so that interference is not experienced, and also selective calling techniques such as CTCSS and DTMF are used to ensure that as many mobiles as possible can use a given channel.

== Selective calling ==

The simplest systems operate with all the radios on a frequency channel being able to hear all the calls being made. In some applications this may not be desirable and a system of selective calling may be required, in which two radios on a channel can have a private conversation which is not received by the others, or in which a specific radio can be promptly contacted and made to &quot;ring&quot; almost like an ordinary phone. Two widely used systems are Dual Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF), and Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System (CTCSS).

=== DTMF ===

A DTMF selective signaling PMRS system uses a code sequence of discrete audible tones, representing numbers, transmitted at the beginning of each voice message to address the transmission to a specific station or group of stations. The DTMF (dual tone multifrequency) code is used, which is also universally used for touch-tone dialing in the worldwide public telephone network. The eight audio frequencies used in DTMF are 697, 770, 852, 941 Hz which are called the &quot;low tones&quot; and 1,209; 1,336; 1,477; and 1,633 Hz which are the &quot;high tones&quot;. Pairs of one high and one low tone transmitted together represent a decimal number. Each station is assigned a unique DTMF callsign, consisting of several numbers. The squelch circuit in each radio decodes the tones and turns the receiver audio on if the transmission is addressed to that radio. There is also a code for &quot;broadcast&quot; transmissions, which causes the transmission to be received by all the radios on the channel.

A disadvantage of this system is that since the DTMF code is sent only once at the beginning of a message, if the receiver does not pick up the code due to temporary noise or bad signal conditions the receiver will not turn on and it will miss the entire message. This can be a significant disadvantage because mobile stations often lose the signal for short periods as they are on the move.

===CTCSS===

Another widely used system is the Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System (CTCSS) also referred to as subaudible tones or PL tones (a Motorola trademark). This uses single audio tones in the range from 67 to 257 Hz to address each message to a specific radio or a group (or fleet) of radios. Each radio or group is assigned a different tone frequency. The code tone is transmitted continuously throughout the audio transmission along with the voice modulation. Since the tones are below the audio passband of the receiver, roughly 300–3,000 Hz, they are filtered out in the receiver&#x27;s audio amplifier and therefore not heard.

Only when the correct tone for the required station is transmitted will the squelch for that receiver (or group) be opened and the transmitted audio be heard. The advantage of this system is that the code tone is transmitted during the entire transmission, instead of just at the beginning as in the DTMF system above, so the system works in spite of noise or signal dropouts. Systems typically are able to provide from 32 to 50 different tones between 67 Hz and 254.1 Hz, allowing multiple separately addressable radios or groups of radios.

==TETRA==

TETRA is a modern standard for digital private mobile radio (PMR) and public access mobile radio (PAMR).

Work started on the development of the TETRA standards in 1990 and has relied on the support of the European Commission and the ETSI members. Experience gained in the development of the GSM cellular radio standard, as well as experience from the development and use of trunked radio systems has also been used to fashion the TETRA standard. In addition to this the process has gained from the co-operation of manufacturers, users, operators and industry experts. With this combined expertise the first standards were ready in 1995 to enable manufacturers to design their equipment to interoperate successfully.

TETRA allocates the channels to users on demand in both voice and data modes. Additionally national and multi-national networks are available and national and international roaming can be supported. For civil systems in Europe the frequency bands 410–430 MHz, 870–876 MHz / 915–921 MHz, 450–470 MHz, 385–390 MHz / 395–399.9 MHz, have been allocated for TETRA. Then for the emergency services in Europe the frequency bands 380–383 MHz and 390–393 MHz have been allocated. In addition to this, the whole or appropriate parts of the bands between 383–385 MHz and 393–395 MHz can be utilized.

Low speed packet data as well as circuit data modes are available, along with some form of encryption. The systems makes use of the available frequency allocations using time-division multiple access (TDMA) technology with four user channels on one radio carrier with 25 kHz spacing between carriers.

The first ruggedized high-speed smartphone based on the TETRA network was launched on 26 May 2011

==PMR trunking using MPT1327==
A trunked version of the private mobile radio (PMR) concept that is defined under the standard MPT 1327 (MPT1327) is widely used and provides significant advantages over the simpler single station systems that are in use. MPT1327 enables stations to communicate over wider areas as well as having additional facilities. In view of the very high cost of setting up trunked networks, they are normally run by large leasing companies or consortia that provide a service to a large number of users. In view of the wider areas covered by these networks and the greater complexity, equipment has to be standardised so that suppliers can manufacture in higher volumes and thereby reduce costs to acceptable levels. Most trunked radio systems follow the MPT1327 format.

To implement trunked PMR a network of stations is set up. These stations are linked generally using land lines, although optical fibers and point to point radio are also used. In this way the different base stations are able to communicate with each other.

In order to be able to carry the audio information and also run the variety of organisational tasks that are needed the system requires different types of channel to be available. These are the control channels of which there is one in each direction for each base station or Trunking System Controller (TSC).

A number of different control channels are used so that adjacent base stations do not interfere with one another, and the mobile stations scan the different channels to locate the strongest control channel signal. In addition to this there are the traffic channels. The specification supports up to 1,024 different traffic channels to be used. In this way a base station can support a large number of different mobile stations that are communicating at the same time. However, for small systems with only a few channels, the control channel may also act as a non-dedicated traffic channel.

The control channels use signalling at 1,200 bits per second with fast frequency shift keying (FFSK) subcarrier modulation. It is designed for use by two-frequency half duplex mobile radio units and a full duplex TSC.

For successful operation it is essential that the system knows where the mobiles are located so that calls can be routed through to them. The TSC (Trunking System Controller) gains this information by mobiles &quot;registering&quot; on a control channel. The MPT1327 standard describes several registration mechanisms, aimed at limiting the load on the control channel caused by mobiles roaming. Registrations may be explicit or implicit. An explicit registration may be initiated by the control channel demanding that a mobile issues a registration request; or initiated by a mobile which has roamed to a new registration area. It is also possible for a mobile to implicitly register, where the TSC will update its registration records when the mobile makes a call attempt. It is possible that the TSC&#x27;s record does not match the mobile&#x27;s location. This can occur, for example, where a mobile is switched off and then moved within coverage of a different site.

To make an outgoing call the mobile transmits a request to the base station as requested in the control channel data stream from the base station. The mobile transmits its own code along with that of the destination of the call, either another mobile or a control office. The control software and circuitry within the base station and the central control processing area for the network sets up the network so that a channel is allocated for the audio (the traffic channel). It also sets up the switching in the network to route the call to the required destination.

To enable the mobile station to receive a call, it is paged via the incoming control channel data stream to indicate that there is an incoming call. Channels are allocated and switching set up to provide the correct routing for the call.

There is no method described within the standard to &quot;handover&quot; the mobile from one base station to the next if it moves out of range of the base station through which a call is being made. In this way the system is not a form of cellular telephone. It is therefore necessary for the mobile station to remain within the service area of the base station through which any calls are being made.

The control channel discipline is Slotted Aloha where the forward or downlink channel (that received by the mobiles) provides timeslots within which a mobile may transmit a request in the uplink channel. In general, a mobile may only transmit on the control channel if invited to by TSC. This invitation may be explicitly addressed to a mobile or a group; or it may be random access. Random access timeslots will be used when a mobile user initiates a call, or when a mobile registers on the TSC.
On a heavily loaded control channel, it is likely that two or more mobile radio units will try to transmit at the same time on the same random access timeslot. This is detected by mobile, when the expected reply from the TSC is not received within a certain timeout. The mobile may then retry its request in another random access slot. The timeouts and number of retries is configured in the mobile when it is set up for the network.

Signalling on the forward control channel is nominally continuous with each slot comprising 64 bit code words. The first type is the Control Channel System Codeword (CSCC). This identifies the system to the mobile radio units and also provides synchronization for the following address codeword. As mentioned the second type of word is the address codeword. It is the first codeword of any message and it defines the nature of the message. It is possible to send data over the control channel. When this occurs, both the CSCC and the address codewords are displaced with the data appended to the address codeword. The mobile radio unit data structure is somewhat simpler. It consists fundamentally of synchronism bits followed by the address codeword.

There are a number of different types of control channel messages that can be sent by the base station to the mobiles:

* Aloha messages — Sent by the base station to invite and mobile stations to access the system
* Requests — Sent by radio units to request a call to be set up
* &quot;Ahoy&quot; messages — Sent by the base station to demand a response from a particular radio unit. This may be sent to request the radio unit to send his unique identifier to ensure it should be taking traffic through the base station.
* Acknowledgments — These are sent by both the base stations and the mobile radio units to acknowledge the data sent.
* Go to channel messages — These messages instruct a particular mobile radio unit to move to the allocated traffic channel.
* Single address messages — These are sent only by the mobile radio units.
* Short data messages — These may be sent by either the base station or the mobile radio unit.
* Miscellaneous messages — Sent by the base station for control applications

Although the data is transmitted as digital information, the audio or voice channels for the system are analogue, employing FM. However some work has been carried out to develop completely digital systems. The main systems are by Motorola, by Ericsson (EDACS) and Johnson (LTR). These systems have not gained such widespread acceptance.

<doc id="735622" wikidata="Q2560269" url="?curid=735622" title="The High Crusade">
<text>The High Crusade is a science fiction novel by American writer Poul Anderson, about the consequences of an extraterrestrial scoutship landing in medieval England. Poul Anderson described the novel as &quot;one of the most popular things I&#x27;ve ever done, going through many book editions in several languages.&quot;

&quot;The High Crusade&quot; was originally serialized in the July–August–September 1960 issues of &quot;Astounding&quot;.

First published in book form in 1960 by Doubleday, it has been published in (at least) June 1964 and September 1968 (by Macfadden Books), 1983, 1991 (by the SFBC and again by Baen Books), 2003, and most recently in 2010. It is in print with a paperback edition issued by Baen Books in 2010 with .

Anderson&#x27;s work was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1961, and was adapted into a 1983 wargame &quot;The High Crusade&quot; of the same name by TSR, Inc. and into a motion picture of the same name in 1994. Anderson wrote one sequel short story, &quot;Quest&quot;, which originally appeared in &quot;Ares&quot; magazine in the same issue that saw the original publication of the wargame.

==Plot summary==

It is 1345, and in the English town of Ansby (in northeastern Lincolnshire), Sir Roger, Baron de Tourneville, is recruiting a military force to assist king Edward III in the Hundred Years&#x27; War against France. Suddenly, an enormous silver spacecraft lands outside the town. It is a scouting craft for the Wersgorix Empire, a brutal dominion light years from our solar system. The Wersgorix hope to take over Earth and are testing the feasibility of colonization. However, the aliens, having forgotten hand-to-hand combat since it was made obsolete by their advanced technology, are caught off-guard by the angered Englishmen, who mistake the craft for a French trick. The villagers and soldiers in Ansby storm the craft and kill all but one Wersgor, Branithar.

Sir Roger formulates a plan that with the captured ship, he can take the entire village to France to win the war, and then liberate the Holy Land. The townspeople, with all of their belongings, board the ship at the baron&#x27;s instruction, and prepare to take off. The people of Ansby are mystified at the advanced technology aboard the ship, which they come to call the &quot;Crusader&quot;. Being unable to pilot the &quot;Crusader&quot; Sir Roger directs the surly Branithar to pilot them to France. Instead, the alien wrecks the baron&#x27;s plan by throwing the &quot;Crusader&quot; into autopilot on course to Tharixan, another Wersgor colony.

The &quot;Crusader&quot; arrives at Tharixan in days, and Sir Roger learns of this new world: it is sparsely-populated, with only three fortresses, Ganturath, Stularax, and Darova (the chief base). The humans capture Ganturath but destroy the &quot;Crusader&quot; in the process. Word spreads of the invaders and a meeting is arranged between Sir Roger and his soldiers and the chief of Tharixan, Huruga.

The humans and Wersgor hold talks that do very little to give either side any advantage, but a truce is agreed to. Sir Roger, in order to intimidate the aliens, makes up tall tales about his estate, &quot;which only took up three planets&quot; and his other accomplishments, including a very successful conquest of Constantinople. Sir Roger demands that the entire Wersgorix state submit to the king of England. During the talks, Baron de Tourneville ignores the truce, and orders the capture of the fortress of Stularax. Unfortunately, the entire base is obliterated by an atomic bomb. In retaliation, Huruga attacks Ganturath again, but loses. He is forced to give up.

Now comes Sir Roger&#x27;s most outrageous plan; having captured Tharixan, he sets out to overthrow the Wersgorix Empire itself. He enlists the help of three other races oppressed by the Wersgor: the Jairs, the Ashenkoghli, and the Prʔ*tans.

Meanwhile, one of his main soldiers and friend, Sir Owain Montbelle, hatches a plan to return to Earth, something that Sir Roger has lost interest in. With Lady Catherine, Sir Roger&#x27;s wife, Montbelle corners the baron and demands that he help the people of Ansby get back to Earth. De Tourneville gives in, but attacks Sir Owain in person. At the climax, Lady Catherine betrays Montbelle and kills him herself. Unfortunately, she also destroys the notes that could have helped get the villagers of Ansby back home.

Sir Roger goes on to topple the Wersgor Empire and build one for himself. He manages with the help of not only the species under the Wersgor, but from members of the Wersgor race who rebelled against their government. The religious figures in the story go on to establish a new branch of the Roman Catholic Church.

===Prologue and epilogue===

A millennium after the main events of &quot;The High Crusade&quot;, the holy galactic empire founded by Sir Roger and his people finally reunites with long lost Earth. A spacecraft from Earth comes across the empire, and is welcomed by the descendants of one of Sir Roger&#x27;s leading soldiers.

There is, in the epilogue, a reference to events on Earth since 1345. The captain of the Earth ship is described as being a loyal subject of an Israeli empire. It also appears that Huruga wound up as an archbishop.

==Reception==
Rating it five stars out of five, &quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale noted that the novel&#x27;s &quot;characters are well-drawn&quot; and declared it &quot;definitely a can&#x27;t-be-put-down enthraller.&quot; The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; found it to be &quot;a delightfully witty science fiction satire,&quot; comparing it to &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot;.

Critic Don D&#x27;Ammassa reported that &quot;The novel&#x27;s undeniable charm outweighs the frequent implausibilities.&quot;

==Movie adaptation==

While George Pal considering filming the novel, he died before producing it. &quot;The High Crusade&quot; was adapted as a motion picture in 1994. It was directed by Klaus Knoesel and Holger Neuhäuser and produced by Roland Emmerich, Ute Emmerich, and Thomas Wöbke.

The movie version of &quot;The High Crusade&quot; differed in many significant respects from the novel. It was written with many comedy elements and had a much-reduced scope; the scoutship bearing the human knights landed at an isolated Wersgorix base, where they battled with the small Wersgorix battalion stationed there before eventually taking the ship back home. Poul Anderson himself avoided viewing the film, having been &quot;told on good authority that it&#x27;s a piece of botchwork.&quot;
